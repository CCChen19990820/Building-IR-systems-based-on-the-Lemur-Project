<h2> President Signs Single Audit Act Amendments</h2>

As was expected, President Clinton signed into law on July 5 the Single Audit Act
Amendments of 1996 (P.L. 104-156). The statute applies to audits of fiscal years
beginning on or after July 1, 1996, and in tandem with recent revisions to the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133, will make numerous changes
to the single audit process.<P>

The new law: raises the audit threshold from $100,000 to expending $300,000 or
more in federal awards, authorizes OMB to establish a risk-based approach to
determining major programs, requires auditors to provide a summary report,
revises the definition of internal controls, and shortens the report deadline to
nine months (after a transition period of at least two years). In addition, P.L.
104-156 gives statutory "teeth" to existing requirements by specifically bringing
universities and other non-profit organizations under the Single Audit Act and
requiring that 50 percent of federal expenditures be covered in an audit.<P>

OMB Circular A-133, <i>Audit of Institutions of Higher Education and Other
Non-Profit Institutions</i>, which was revised April 30, will be amended again to
reflect the new law, mainly by applying the circular to state and local
governments and rescinding Circular A-128.<P>

<head><title>Discriminatory Intent Cannot Be Inferred By Proximity of Termination to FMLA Leave</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/person/time/timehead.gif" alt="Family and Medical Leave Handbook">
<P>
<h2>Discriminatory Intent Cannot Be Inferred By Proximity of Termination to FMLA Leave</h2>

An employer's intent to discriminate based on an employee's assertion of rights under the Family and
Medical Leave Act (FMLA) cannot be inferred from the length of time between an employee's return from
leave and his or her termination, the U.S. District Court for Southern Texas recently ruled.<P>

Bettye Garcia claimed that her employer, Fulbright &amp; Jaworski L.L.P., retaliated against her in
response to her using medical leave under the FMLA, when the company fired her a month after her return
from leave. The law firm responded that Garcia had been terminated for poor performance and the
proximity of its termination decision to the employee's medical leave was irrelevant.<P>

Garcia was employed by the firm as a section clerk, performing filing and word processing under the
supervision of Brenda Pittman, the secretarial coordinator. A 1992 performance evaluation indicated that
Garcia needed to improve in several areas. Pittman counseled Garcia and stated that the employee would
have three months to improve her performance and would be reviewed again at the end of that time. If
Garcia failed to improve her performance, Pittman implied that there might not be a section clerk position
for her with the firm. The three-month review showed some improvement in Garcia's performance, but her
evaluations later in the year indicated that her job performance was deteriorating.<P>

During this time, the employee requested and was granted a medical leave of absence for eye surgery and
then foot surgery. She returned to work two months later, her physicians providing a return to work
authorization with no restrictions. Approximately one month after returning from leave, Pittman met with
and informed Garcia that the company had decided to terminate her due to "continuing failure to meet
minimum job requirements."<P>

Citing the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' holding in <I>Oswalt v. Sara Lee Corp.</I>, 74 F.3d 91 (1996), the
Texas district court stated that establishing a prima facie case under the FMLA was similar to establishing
such a case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court held that Garcia must demonstrate she
met certain criteria outlined in <I>Oswalt</I> to establish a prima facie case under the federal leave law, including
that:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) she was protected under the FMLA;<P>

(2) she suffered an adverse employment decision; and<P>

(3) she was treated less favorably than an employee who had not requested leave under the FMLA or that
the adverse decision was made because of her request for leave.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

The employer argued that Garcia failed to establish a prima facie case because she had not produced
evidence that her termination resulted from the medical leave. The firm stated that "her poor performance
reviews and probation predated her FMLA leave period and reflect that she did not do her job adequately
before or after her return from leave."<P>

The firm also maintained that because Garcia's job performance was well-documented and consistently
poor, she could not demonstrate that the company's reasoning for her discharge was pretextual. The firm
also argued that the employee could not show that she was treated differently from similarly situated
employees in light of its termination for poor performance of three other section clerks who had not taken
leave under the FMLA.<P>

Garcia argued that her performance reports cited her absences for medical reasons as one reason for her
work problems. She also stated that she twice tried to talk to Pittman about her medical condition and
resulting absences, but was refused by the supervisor.<P>

The court granted the employer's motion for summary judgment, stating that Garcia's physicians'
certification of her ability to return to work without restrictions supported the fact that her medical
condition did not hinder her job performance. Also, the court noted that she had failed to demonstrate the
requisite intent to discriminate on the part of her employer. "Her conclusory allegation that Pittman
intentionally twice refused her request for time to discuss her medical condition . . . is insufficient to show
intent to discriminate," the court said, adding that Garcia's statement that her evaluations had mentioned
her absences as resulting in performance problems was also insufficient to establish discriminatory intent.
"Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that poor work performance was not the cause of her termination," the
court said.<P>

The court found that Garcia had offered only "conclusory allegations" as proof that she was terminated in
retaliation for asserting her rights under the FMLA, and had presented no evidence or authority to back her
claims. "Discriminatory intent cannot be inferred merely from the time an employee is terminated after
returning from the FMLA leave," the court ruled, citing <I>Day v. Excel Corp.</I>, No. 94-1439-JTM (D. Kan.
1996). (<I>Garcia v. Fulbright &amp; Jaworski L.L.P.</I>, S.D. Texas, Civil Action No. H-95-0053, Aug. 15,
1996) <P>

</P>

<P>
<B>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</B> In the <I>Federal Register</I> of December 8, 1995 (60 FR 63384), FDA published and sought public comment on two draft guidances entitled "Guidance to Industry on Dissemination of Reprints of Certain Published, Original Data" and "Guidance for Industry Funded Dissemination of Reference Texts." These guidances relate to the dissemination, by sponsors of human and animal drugs, medical devices, and biological products, of certain reprints of journal articles and reference texts (medical textbooks and compendia), which contain information concerning FDA-approved products that may not be consistent with the approved labeling for the products.
</P>

<P>
The agency received over 57 comments in response to the request for comments on the draft guidances. The comments came from drug and device manufacturers, professional health organizations, industry trade organizations, patient advocacy organizations, health communications specialists, attorneys, and health professionals. The agency has reviewed and considered these comments in its analysis of whether and what changes should be made in finalizing these guidances. As a result of this analysis, the agency has determined that no changes need to be made to the "Guidance to Industry on Dissemination of Reprints of Certain Published, Original Data." The "Guidance for Industry Funded
Dissemination of Reference Texts" remains essentially unchanged; except in the discussion of circumstances for dissemination of reference texts, FDA added an additional circumstance concerning
product promotion, as noted below.
</P>

<P>
The agency received several comments claiming that the guidance on dissemination of certain reprints does not go far enough, arguing that companies should be permitted to disseminate any article they choose, regardless of what information is discussed in the article or whether the information is consistent with the approved product labeling. The agency also received several comments that gave specific suggestions of the types of articles that should be permitted under a policy with a broader scope (e.g., all peer-reviewed articles, technical reports). FDA believes that the guidances that are the subject of this notice strike the proper balance between the need for an exchange of reliable
scientific data and information within the health care community, and the statutory requirements that prohibit companies from promoting products for unapproved uses. However, the agency will continue to
evaluate its policies related to the advertising and promotion of FDA-regulated products, and these guidances are just one part of its policy in this area.
</P>

<P>
The agency also received comments seeking clarification of certain aspects of the guidances. Although these comments were considered in determining the final version of these guidances, they are not
individually addressed in this notice. The agency welcomes questions from interested parties regarding the practical application of these guidances. Specific questions should be directed to the appropriate persons within the agency who address advertising and promotion issues for the particular regulated product. (See contact persons above.)
</P>

<P>
One comment suggested that sponsors should not be allowed to use reprints or reference texts as a tool to promote unapproved uses of their products. The agency does not intend for these materials to be used in this way. Upon consideration, the agency has determined that an additional "circumstance" should be added to the guidance on reference texts making it clear that company representatives should not refer to, or otherwise promote, information in the reference text that is not consistent with the approved labeling for a product.
</P>

<P>
The texts of the final guidance documents follow:
</P>


<P>
<H3><A NAME="guide1">Guidance to Industry on Dissemination of Reprints of Certain Published, Original Data[1]</A></H3>
</P>


<P>
<B>I. Purpose of Guidance</B>
</P>


<P>
Sponsors frequently want to disseminate reprints of articles reporting the results of the effectiveness trials that have been relied on by FDA in its approval or clearance of a drug, device, or biologic product. However, such articles may contain effectiveness rates, data, analyses, uses, regimens, or other information that is different from the approved labeling, and might, if disseminated by the sponsor, be considered violative promotional activities.
</P>

<P>
Nonetheless, the agency intends to allow sponsors to disseminate reprints of articles that represent the peer-reviewed, published version of original efficacy trials, under the circumstances described in section II., below.
</P>

<P>
<B>II. Circumstances for Dissemination of Certain Journal Articles Discussing FDA-Approved Products</B>
</P>

<P>
1. The principal subject of the article should be the use(s) or indication(s) that has been approved by FDA. The article should be published in accordance with the regular peer-review procedure of
the journal in which it is published, and the article should report the original study that was represented by the sponsor, submitted to FDA, and accepted by the agency as one of the adequate and well-controlled studies providing evidence of effectiveness. In the case of a medical device, this guidance also applies to studies that were otherwise represented by the sponsor, submitted to the agency, and accepted by the agency as valid and material evidence of safety or effectiveness in lieu of adequate and well-controlled studies;
</P>

<P>
2. The reprint should be from a bona fide peer-reviewed journal. A bona fide peer-reviewed journal is a journal that uses experts to objectively review and select, reject, or provide comments about
proposed articles. Such experts should have demonstrated expertise in the subject of the article under review, and be independent from the journal;
</P>

<P>
3. If the article contains effectiveness rates, data, analyses, uses, regimens, or other information that is different from approved labeling, the reprint should prominently state the difference(s),
with specificity, on the face of the reprint. One acceptable means of achieving the appropriate prominence for this statement is to permanently affix to the reprint a sticker stating the differences; and
</P>

<P>
4. The reprint should disclose all material facts and should not be false or misleading.
</P>


<P>
<H3><A NAME="guide2">Guidance for Industry Funded Dissemination of Reference Texts[2]</A></H3>
</P>


<P>
<B>I. Purpose of Guidance</B>
</P>

<P>
Sponsors have expressed a desire to disseminate reference texts, i.e., medical textbooks and compendia, to health care professionals. These texts typically discuss a wide range of medical diagnoses and treatments, including drug product utilization, surgical techniques, and other medical topics, and are often useful to clinicians in the practice of medicine.
</P>

<P>
Reference texts often contain information about the use of drugs, devices, or biologic products in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of disease that may not be consistent with the FDA-approved labeling for the products (e.g., discussion of unapproved uses). While many textbooks do not necessarily highlight a particular drug or device manufacturer's products, the dissemination of these reference texts by regulated industry may still be in conflict with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and implementing regulations.[3]
</P>

<P>
Nonetheless, FDA intends to permit the distribution of sound, authoritative materials that are written, published, and disseminated independent of the commercial interest of a sponsoring
company and are not false or misleading. FDA, therefore, intends to allow sponsors to disseminate reference texts that discuss human or animal drug, device, or biologic products, under the circumstances described in section II., below.
</P>

<P>
<B>II. Circumstances for Dissemination of Reference Texts</B>
</P>

<P>
1. The reference text should not have been written, edited, excerpted, or published specifically for, or at the request of, a drug, device, or biologic firm, unless the text was prepared in a manner that results in a balanced presentation of the subject matter (see III. below);
</P>

<P>
2. The content of the reference text should not have been reviewed, edited, or significantly influenced by a drug, device, or biologic firm, or agent thereof, unless the text was prepared in a
manner that results in a balanced presentation of the subject matter (see III. below);
</P>

<P>
3. The reference text should not be distributed only or primarily through drug, device, or biologic firms (e.g., it should be generally available for sale in bookstores or other distribution channels where similar books are normally available);
</P>

<P>
4. The reference text should not focus primarily on any particular drug(s), device(s), or biologic(s) of the disseminating company, nor should it have a significant focus on unapproved uses of the drug(s), device(s), or biologic(s) marketed or under investigation by the firm supporting the dissemination of the text;
</P>

<P>
5. Specific product information (other than the approved package insert) should not be physically appended to the reference text; and
</P>

<P>
6. A drug, device, or biological product company representative should not refer to, or otherwise promote, in any manner or at any time, information in the reference text that is not consistent with
the approved labeling for a product.
</P>

<P>
<B>III. Exception</B>
</P>

<P>
The agency recognizes that there are some useful reference texts that are written, edited, or published by a sponsor or agent of a sponsor. In those instances, where the authorship, editing, and
publishing of the reference text results in a balanced presentation of the subject matter, FDA intends to allow the distribution of a reference text under the circumstances described in paragraphs 3 through 6 above. Typically, evidence of a balanced presentation of the subject matter would consist of an authorship and editorial process that fosters input from a relatively wide spectrum of sources and allows for consideration of information from all sources.

<P>
<h2>New Pension Law: A Provision-by-Provision Analysis</h2>

<P>
President Clinton signed landmark pension reform legislation on Aug. 20, and sweeping changes to a wide range of pension administration rules and regulations will go into effect over the next several years.
</P>

<P>
The new law, the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-188), offers alternative means for satisfying the nondiscrimination tests for 401(k) plans, changes the definition of a highly compensated employee (HCE) and streamlines certain plan distribution rules. 
</P>

<P>
It also simplifies the definition of compensation limits and repeals the family aggregation rule and the combined plan limit.
</P>

<P>
This special report highlights the pension-related provisions in the new law. For each provision that will affect the administration of defined contribution or defined benefit pension plans, or both, the report summarizes the current law, the change, and the new provision's effective date. 
</P>

<P>
In addition, the report also contains analyses of some of the more significant changes. This commentary was provided by Joseph Hessenthaler, a principal at Towers Perrin and contributing editor of the <I>401(k) Handbook</I>. It is aimed at guiding you through the legal language and into its "real world" implications.
</P>

<P>
The following provision-by-provision analysis of the new pension law is organized by topic: simplified distribution rules; increased access to retirement plans; nondiscrimination testing changes; and miscellaneous provisions. The first sidebar shows when each provision takes effect; the second sidebar lists related provisions in the law that have less relevance to 401(k) plans.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT><I>Simplified Distribution Rules</I></H3>
</P>

<P>
<B>Repeal of five-year averaging for lump-sum distributions</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> Plan participants may use five-year forward income averaging for calculating the tax on lump-sum distributions. This allows the taxpayer to pay a separate tax on the lump-sum distribution that approximates the tax due if the distribution were made in equal installments over a five-year period. The taxpayer may deduct the lump-sum distribution from gross income. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> This five-year averaging option will be eliminated, and the separate tax on the lump-sum distribution and the income deduction will be repealed.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> Lump-sum distribution treatment will still apply to 401(k) plans for the net unrealized appreciation of the distribution of employer securities. Similarly, the current lump-sum distribution treatment will be available for the separate tax treatment of excess distributions. 
</P>

<P>
Plan administrators should update employee communications to reflect this change when it takes effect, including the required notice on rollover rights.
</P>

<P>
<B>Exclusion for death benefits</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> When a plan participant dies, the plan beneficiary may exclude $5,000 in employer-provided benefits from gross income. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> The exclusion will be repealed.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> For plan participants who die after Aug. 20, 1996.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> With no exclusion, the determination of taxable income on a distribution is now simpler. 
</P>

<P>
Given the effective date, employers must adjust their reporting procedures promptly. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Simplified rules for taxing annuity distributions</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> For annuity benefits under a qualified plan, the return on investment in the annuity contract is not considered income for tax purposes. The amount of nontaxable return on investment ("return of basis") may be determined by dividing an employee's total investment by the total expected payments over the annuity's term. The IRS, however, also offers a simplified method for determining the taxable portions of annuity benefits.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> The new law calculates taxable annuity benefits using a method similar to the IRS' simplified method. To use this method, the total investment would be divided by the number of anticipated payments, as illustrated below.
</P>


<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" CELLSPACING="1">

<TR ALIGN=CENTER>
<TH ALIGN=CENTER>Age distribution begins</TH><TH ALIGN=CENTER>Number of payments</TH>

</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Applies to annuities with starting dates after Nov. 18, 1996.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> This change simplifies the calculation, but the new method is less generous because it takes longer to recover the nontaxable amount. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Required distributions at age 70 1/2</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> For participants in qualified plans, distributions must begin by April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the participant turns 70 1/2.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> For participants who are still working, the distribution must begin by April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the participant retires.
</P>

<P>
Moreover, the accrued benefit of participants who retire after 70 1/2 will be "actuarially increased" to take into account the time period after the attainment of age 70 1/2 in which benefits increased in value. Thus, the accrued benefit must reflect the value of benefits the participant would have received if he or she had retired at 70 1/2 and had begun receiving benefits at that time. The actuarial adjustment is not required for defined contribution plans.
</P>

<P>
The change does not apply to IRAs, or to plan participants who are 5-percent owners.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> For participants currently receiving required minimum distributions, the legislative intent appears to be that a plan may, but is not required to, allow such participants the right to stop the distributions. The plan, however, cannot stop the distributions without the participant's consent.
</P>

<P>
Besides changing employee communications, employers must create a procedure for adjusting the pension benefits of participants who work and who will begin receiving benefits after age 70 1/2.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT><I>Increased Access to Retirement Plans</I></H3>
</P>

<P>
<B>Establishment of SIMPLE retirement plans for small businesses</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employers) plans do not exist under current law. A somewhat similar plan -- a salary reduction simplified employee pension (SARSEP) -- can now be maintained by employers with 25 or fewer employees. SARSEPs are not qualified plans; they function like IRAs, in which employees and employers make contributions similar to a 401(k) arrangement. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> Small businesses (100 or fewer employees who earn at least $5,000 per year) that do not offer other retirement plans can offer SIMPLE plans. A SIMPLE plan could function as either an IRA for each employee or as a 401(k) plan. It will not be subject to nondiscrimination or top-heavy rules, and will have simplified reporting requirements. Moreover, ERISA will be amended so that employers are not subject to fiduciary liability regarding employees' control over their SIMPLE accounts. 
</P>

<P>
SIMPLE plan sponsors must fulfill either a matching or nonelective contribution formula. Under the matching arrangement, in any five-year period an employer must make a 100-percent matching contribution for the first 3 percent of an employee's salary for at least three years. For the remaining two years, an employer must make a 100-percent matching contribution for the first 1 percent of an employee's salary.
</P>

<P>
Under the nonelective option, the employer must make a guaranteed contribution equivalent to 2 percent of an employee's salary for every employee earning more than $5,000 per year. 
</P>

<P>
Contributions to the SIMPLE plan cannot exceed $6,000 per year (indexed for inflation) and must be fully vested. SIMPLE accounts may be rolled over into an IRA two years after an employee enters the plan. 
</P>

<P>
Withdrawals of contributions during the first two years of participation will be subject to a 25-percent excise tax. Withdrawals after two years will be subject to a 10-percent excise tax. Employer matching or nonelective contributions are not treated as wages for employment purposes. 
</P>

<P>
Companies with SIMPLE plans that grow beyond 100 employees have two years to dismantle their plans. 
</P>

<P>
New SARSEPs cannot be set up, but SARSEPs currently operating will be allowed to continue.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> The SIMPLE provisions go into effect Jan. 1, 1997. 
</P>

<P>
New SARSEPs cannot be created after Jan. 1, 1997. SARSEPs established before that date will be allowed to continue, and new employees hired after that date will still be allowed to make contributions.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> With the enactment of SIMPLE, Congress intends to encourage the adoption of 401(k)-type plans by small businesses. It remains to be seen whether the required level of minimum employer contribution under SIMPLE will dampen the enthusiasm for establishing these new plans. However, several vendor groups appear to be geared up to market this concept, and this may help the spread of these programs.
</P>

<P>
<B>Tax-exempt organizations eligible for 401(k) plans</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> Tax-exempt organizations cannot offer 401(k) plans, unless the plan was established before July 2, 1986.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> The law is repealed for tax-exempt organizations, including Indian tribal groups; state and local governments are excluded.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> The provision is effective for plan years beginning after Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> With this change, all nonprofit organizations may now maintain elective tax-deferred plans. However, nonprofits eligible to maintain a 403(b) plan will need to consider the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a 401(k) plan, given its ADP testing requirements.
</P>

<P>
<B>IRAs for spouses</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> In general, the annual deductible contribution limit for IRAs is the lesser of $2,000 or 100 percent of compensation. For married individuals whose spouses do not work for compensation, the limit is $2,250.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> Deductible IRA contributions of up to $2,000 can be made for each spouse, even if the spouse does not work, as long as the combined compensation of both spouses is at least equal to the contributed amount. But the current rules that phase out deductible IRA contributions for adjusted gross income above certain levels still apply.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT><I>Nondiscrimination Testing Changes</I></H3>
</P>

<P>
<B>Simplified definition of highly compensated employee</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> An employee is considered a highly compensated employee (HCE) if during the preceding year one of the following conditions apply: he or she was a 5-percent owner of the company; earned more than $100,000 in 1996 from the employer; earned more than $66,000 and was in the top 20 percent of the company's earners; or was an officer of the employer who earned more than $60,000. If no officer earned more than $60,000, the highest-paid officer is considered an HCE.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> An employee will be considered an HCE if during the preceding year he or she was a 5-percent owner of the company or earned more than $80,000.
</P>

<P>
A plan could choose a definition that would not consider employees earning over $80,000 as HCEs if they were not in the top 20 percent of the company's earners, unless the employee was a 5-percent owner.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> For the 1997 plan year, employers must use the $80,000 limit when reviewing employee compensation for 1996. 
</P>

<P>
In general, this change should decrease the number of HCEs, and will enable their identification in the beginning of the year. This change should also help many plans pass the nondiscrimination tests, and should eliminate cuts in distributions for many middle managers.
</P>

<P>
<B>Repeal of the family aggregation rule</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> If an employee is a 5-percent owner or is one of the company's top 10 earners, then the compensation and benefits paid to the employee is aggregated with family members who are also employees when conducting the nondiscrimination tests and calculating compensation limits under 401(a)(17).
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> The rule will be repealed.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> For small plans, this change could make a difference in passing the nondiscrimination tests. This would also help in Section 415 testing, because employees will not have to be aggregated when determining compensation limits, thus decreasing the chances of exceeding the 25-percent-of-pay limitation.
</P>

<P>
<B>Modification of additional participation requirements</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> Qualified plans must cover at least 50 employees or 40 percent of the company's workers, whichever is less. The rule may be applied separately to an employer's different lines of business, but each line of business must have at least 50 employees. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> The requirement will apply only to defined benefit plans. A plan will not satisfy the requirement unless it benefits the lesser of: (1) 50 employees; or (2) the greater of 40 percent of all employees or two employees (one employee if there is only one).
</P>

<P>
In addition, lines of business would not need 50 employees to qualify as separate lines of business for these requirements.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> This change should encourage more employers to start defined contribution plans, especially when employers have small divisions or separate ventures that need different plans.
</P>

<P>
<B>Prior year testing</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> For qualified cash or deferred arrangements, the nondiscrimination test is satisfied if the actual deferral percentage (ADP) or actual contribution percentage (ACP) for highly compensated employees, <I>for the same plan year</I>, is equal to or less than: (1) 125 percent of the ADP of all eligible nonhighly compensated employees; or (2) the lesser of either (a) 200 percent of the ADP of all eligible nonhighly compensated employees or (b) 200 percent of the ADP plus 2 percentage points.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> In nondiscrimination testing, the ADP or ACP for nonhighly compensated employees for the current year will be compared with their prior year's ADP or ACP, unless an employer elects to use the current year ADP or ACP. If the employer uses the current year, that election could only be changed by following specific IRS procedures.
</P>

<P>
New plans could use a straight 3-percent assumption or the plan could elect to use current year data for nonhighly compensated employees.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> The employer will still have to do a full test for HCEs and non-HCEs. However, the non-HCEs' ADP and ACP for the current year will be computed or deferred based on their prior year's contributions and pay. 
</P>

<P>
In addition, the change raises several questions, such as how the ADP and ACP will be calculated for current year non-HCEs who made no contributions in the prior year, particularly in cases where they were ineligible to do so. The applicable statutory language may not be consistent with congressional intent. Therefore, clarification from the IRS, or a technical correction from Congress, may be forthcoming. 
</P>

<P>
<B>ADP safe harbor for cash or deferred arrangements</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> For qualified cash or deferred arrangements, the nondiscrimination test is satisfied if the ADP for highly compensated employees, <I>for the same plan year</I>, is equal to or less than: (1) 125 percent of the ADP of all eligible nonhighly compensated employees; or (2) the lesser of either (a) 200 percent of the ADP of all eligible nonhighly compensated employees or (b) 200 percent of the ADP plus 2 percentage points.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> The nondiscrimination tests for cash or deferred arrangements will be satisfied if the plan fulfills one of two contribution requirements and a notice requirement.
</P>

<P>
For the contribution requirement, the employer must, on behalf of all eligible nonhighly compensated employees: (1) make a nonelective contribution to a defined contribution plan of at least 3 percent of salary for every eligible nonhighly compensated employee; or (2) make a matching contribution equal to (a) 100 percent of the employee's elective contributions for the first 3 percent of salary and (b) 50 percent of elective contributions from 3 percent to 5 percent of salary. 
</P>

<P>
In addition, the rate of match for highly compensated employees cannot be greater than the rate of match for nonhighly compensated employees. This rule also applies to the following alternative.
</P>

<P>
As an alternative to the second option above, the employer will satisfy the matching requirement if the employer's matching contribution does not increase as an employee's rate of elective contribution increases, and the aggregate amount of matching contributions at any rate of elective contributions is as great as it would have been if the percentages in the first option above were satisfied.
</P>

<P>
The notice requirement will be fulfilled if each eligible employee is given advance written notice of his or her rights and obligations under the arrangement.
</P>

<P>
Matches must be offered as soon as the employee is eligible to contribute. The contributions must be 100-percent vested, and cannot be withdrawn until the employee reaches age 59 1/2.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> Under this change, a plan that offers a 100-percent match for the first 4 percent of salary would fulfill the safe harbor requirements. 
</P>

<P>
A plan that offers a 50-percent match on the first 2 percent of salary and a 200-percent match on the next 1 percent of salary would not fulfill the safe harbor requirements, since it offers less than the safe harbor minimum on the 1-percent and 2-percent elective contributions and then increases as the rate of elective contributions increases. A plan with a service-weighted matching contribution would fulfill the safe harbor requirement that the rate for any HCE cannot exceed the rate for any non-HCE whenever at least one HCE receives the highest matching contribution and at least one non-HCE receives the lowest matching contribution. 
</P>

<P>
<B>ACP safe harbor for defined contribution plans</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> Employer matching contributions and after-tax employee contributions under qualified defined contribution plans are subject to special actual contribution percentage (ACP) nondiscrimination tests similar to the ADP tests. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> A plan would satisfy the ACP test if it meets the contribution and notice requirements under the ADP safe harbor, and if it follows a limitation on matching contributions.
</P>

<P>
To fulfill the matching contribution limitation, the plan must limit employer matching contributions to the first 6 percent of compensation deferred by the employee. The rate of the employer's matching contribution cannot increase as the employee's rate of deferral increases. Also, the rate of match for highly compensated employees cannot be greater than that for nonhighly compensated employees.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> After-tax contributions still must be tested. If a plan sponsor is making safe harbor matching contributions, it seems that the contributions could not be used in after-tax testing unless the contributions exceed the safe harbor. Furthermore, the new law does not clarify if the safe harbor is available for plans with matching contributions only or on after-tax contributions or pretax contributions to a 403(b) plan. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Alternative nondiscrimination rules for early participation</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> A plan can prohibit employees from participating if they are not 21 years old or have less than one year of service. 
</P>

<P>
For the ADP and ACP tests, the employer may separately test eligible employees who otherwise could have been excluded (those under 21 years old or with less than one year's service). If as a group they fulfill the Section 410(b) coverage rules, the employer may exclude them when conducting the ADP or ACP tests for eligible employees.
</P>

<P>
The employer has the option to ease the eligibility requirements -- for example, lowering the age to 18 and eliminating the one-year service requirement.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> Instead of separate testing, the plan would be able to conduct one ADP test in which the ADP for all highly compensated employees eligible to make contributions (including those who only satisfy the "lessened" requirements) is compared with the ADP for eligible nonhighly compensated employees who are over 21 and have completed one year of service. Separate testing for Section 410(b) coverage is still required.
</P>

<P>
A similar rule applies to the ACP test.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>

<P>
<B>Distribution of excess contributions</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> Qualified cash or deferred arrangement plans that fail nondiscrimination testing may distribute excess contributions to employees. In determining the amount of excess contributions and the employees to whom they are allocated, the contributions of highly compensated employees are reduced in the order of their actual deferral percentage, beginning with those highly compensated employees with the highest actual deferral percentages. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> Distribution of excess contributions will be required to be made on the amount of the contribution by each highly compensated employee, rather than on the actual deferral percentage. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> The highest paid employees will likely receive excess distributions. Therefore, some employers may feel pressure to maintain a nonqualified 401(k) makeup arrangement.
</P>

<P>
<B>Definition of compensation for contribution limits</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> The definition of compensation does not include employee contributions to certain plans.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> Employee contributions to Section 401(k), Section 403(b), Section 457 and Section 125 plans will be included as compensation when determining Section 415 contribution and benefit limits.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1998.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> This provision should relieve some of the pressure of the Section 415 limitations on lower-paid employees who contribute the maximum amounts to their dependent care and medical flexible spending accounts and to their 401(k) plans. 
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT><I>Miscellaneous Provisions</I></H3>
</P>

<P>
<B>Change in uniform retirement age</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> The uniform retirement age, when used for nondiscrimination testing, is 65.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> The Social Security retirement age will be treated as a uniform retirement age for purposes of the general nondiscrimination rules. The Social Security retirement age is currently 65, but is scheduled to increase gradually.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<B>Contributions for employees with disabilities</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> Employers may elect to continue contributing to the defined contribution plan of employees who are permanently and totally disabled, but not if they were owners, officers or highly compensated employees before becoming disabled. For the limits on annual additions, the compensation of a disabled employee is equal to his or her annual compensation before the disability.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> If the plan provides for the continuation of employer contributions for disabled employees, the employer would not need a special election to do so. Employers may also provide for disabled highly compensated employees.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> This change eliminates one of the main reasons employers do not currently provide contributions to disabled employees under 401(k) or other defined contribution plans -- the special election.
</P>

<P>
<B>Waiver of minimum waiting period for annuity distributions</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> With qualified joint and survivor annuities, participants must receive a written explanation of benefits no less than 30 days and no more than 90 days before the annuity starting date. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> The 30-day minimum period will not apply if waived by the participant and the participant's spouse (if necessary). The payments could be made immediately once the participant completes the waiver, and payments could be retroactive.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<B>Correction of interest and mortality rate provisions</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> Under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), when adjusting a nonannuity benefit or the dollar limitations on benefits that begin before age 62, the interest rate used cannot be less than either the rate specified in the plan or a 5-percent rate, whichever is greater.
</P>

<P>
If the benefit is subject to Section 417(e)(3) requirements, the interest rate on 30-year Treasury securities is substituted for the 5-percent rate. In addition, the mortality table from the Secretary of the Treasury must be used. 
</P>

<P>
Similar rules apply to the interest rate and mortality assumptions used in calculating the value of lump-sum distributions for involuntary dispositions of certain accrued benefits. For plans adopted before Dec. 8, 1995, those rules do not apply before the earlier of the date a plan amendment that applies the assumption is adopted or goes into effect (whichever is later), or the first day of the first plan year beginning after Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> For benefits subject to Section 417(e)(3) requirements, a plan can no longer substitute the 30-year Treasury securities interest rate for the 5-percent option when calculating reductions on dollar limits under Section 415. 
</P>

<P>
In addition, for plans in effect before GATT (Dec. 8, 1994), the effective date of the interest rate and the mortality assumptions used to calculate benefit and contribution limits will conform with the provisions on calculating lump-sum distributions. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Retroactive to Dec. 8, 1994.
</P>

<P>
<B>Repeal of combined plan limit</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> Annual contributions to defined contribution plans are generally limited to the lesser of $30,000 or 25 percent of compensation. For defined benefit plans, the annual benefit is generally limited to the lesser of $120,000 or 100 percent of the participant's average compensation for the highest three years. There is a combined limit if the employee participates in both types of plans.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> The combined limit will be repealed.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> Many employers will be able to contribute more to higher-paid employees in defined benefit plans. In addition, employers will not need to maintain or retrieve cumbersome historical data on their defined contribution plans. Finally, this change also enhances opportunities to provide more benefit for highly compensated employees in a defined benefit plan.
</P>

<P>
<B>Suspension of excess distribution tax</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> Annual distributions from qualified plans that exceed $150,000 (or $750,000 for a lump-sum distribution) are subject to a 15-percent excise tax. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> For distributions received in 1997, 1998 and 1999, until the repeal of the combined plan limit goes into effect, the excise tax will be suspended.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> For distributions received in 1997 through 1999.
</P>

<P>
<B>Increase in prohibited transaction tax</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> An excise tax is now imposed on prohibited transactions, equal to 5 percent of the amount of the transaction. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> The tax will increase to 10 percent.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Transactions occuring after Aug. 20, 1996.
</P>

<P>
<B>Changes in treatment of leased employees</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> A leased employee is treated as an employee for benefits purposes if the individual has performed services on a substantially full-time basis for at least a year, and the services are typical of those "historically performed" in the employer's business.
</P>

<P>
If more than 20 percent of an employer's nonhighly compensated workforce is leased, all leased individuals are to be treated as employees for employee benefits eligibility.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> In determining a leased employee's eligibility for benefits, the "historically performed" services criteria will be replaced by a new "primary control" test. Under this test, a leased employee will be treated as an employee if he or she is under the primary direction or control of the organization for which the employee performs the services. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> This change moves the status determination closer to the reality of the relationship between leased employees and the organizations for which they perform services.  
</P>

<P>
<B>Penalties for pension reporting requirements</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> There is a two-tiered penalty system for sponsors who fail to file information reports to the IRS on time: a penalty for each failure and a separate flat amount for each failure to file with the IRS or to notify payees.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> A single system will replace the two-tiered system. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<B>New language for spousal consent forms</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> Benefits from a plan subject to survivor benefit rules may be paid in a form other than a qualified joint and survivor annuity (QJSA) or a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (QPSA) if the participant signs a waiver and satisfies the relevant requirements.
</P>

<P>
In addition, benefits may be paid to a former spouse according to a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO).
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> By Jan. 1, 1997, the Secretary of the Treasury must develop new language for the spousal consent form and QDRO that discloses whether the QJSA or QPSA waiver is irrevocable and whether it could be revoked by a QDRO.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<P>
<B>Waiver of excise tax on liquidity shortfalls</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> Certain underfunded defined benefit plans that will have liquidity shortfalls must make quarterly payments to maintain their liquid assets. If these payments are not made, the plan sponsor is subject to an excise tax equal to 10 percent of the outstanding liquidity shortfall.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> The Secretary of the Treasury may waive the excise tax for failing to make a liquidity shortfall payment if the plan sponsor establishes that the shortfall was due to reasonable cause and reasonable steps have been taken to remedy it.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Aug. 20, 1996.
</P>

<P>
<B>Adoption of plan amendments</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> In general, plan amendments for complying with rule changes must be made by the income tax return deadline for the taxable year in which the change occurs.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> Plan amendments or annuity changes made to reflect these new pension simplification provisions will not be required before the first plan year on or after Jan. 1, 1998. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Aug. 20, 1996.
</P>

<P>
<B>Comments:</B> The provision's language does not clarify whether the amendments will have to be made by the end of the 1998 plan year or at a later date.
</P>

<P>
<B>Veteran's bill technical corrections</B>
</P>

<P>
<B>Current law:</B> The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) did not clarify how makeup plan contributions made by veterans returning from military duty would affect plan qualification or plan loan requirements.
</P>

<P>
<B>Change:</B> Makeup contributions made by veterans who were away on military duty will not be subject to Section 404 and 415 limitations for the year that the contributions are made. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Effective:</B> Retroactive to Dec. 12, 1994.

<title> Court Declines to Assess Notice Penalties and Attorney's Fees</title>

<h2>Court Declines to Assess Notice Penalties and Attorney's Fees, Noting Ex-employee Tried to Exploit "Inadvertent Error"</h2>

An employer and insurer were not liable for notice penalties and attorney's fees because they took
"immediate remedial steps" once they realized an election notice was not sent on a timely basis, and the
aggrieved qualified beneficiary did not incur any damages, a federal district court in Kansas ruled. In <I>Kost
v. United Parcel Service, Inc.,</I> 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11832 (D. Kan. 1996), the court also took the
qualified beneficiary to task, noting that she tried to exploit the defendants' "inadvertent error" to collect a
"windfall award."  <P>

<H3>Facts of the Case</H3><P>

Shanda Kost was an employee of United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS). Kost was covered under the company's
group health plan, of which UPS was the plan administrator and Aetna Life Insurance Co., was the claims
administrator. When someone incurred a qualifying event, it was UPS' practice to notify Aetna of any
employment terminations and rely upon Aetna to send written COBRA election notices. (See Practice
Pointer.)<P>

In September 1993, Kost terminated her employment. However, she did not receive a COBRA notice on a
timely basis. Possibly due to a computer error by either UPS or Aetna, her employee separation form was
not entered into the UPS computer system until December 1993--three months after she resigned. The
court could not determine precisely what happened because computer tapes were only kept for 13 weeks;
therefore, when the case went to trial in July 1996, the December 1993 tapes were no longer available for
review.<P>

Fifteen months after Kost terminated employment, her attorney notified UPS and Aetna in a Dec. 10, 1994,
letter that she had not received a COBRA notice. UPS then agreed to provide retroactive coverage and
waive the COBRA premium for the 17-month period between October 1993 and February 1995. Kost
rejected that offer. <P>

Kost sued UPS and Aetna for COBRA notice violations, and sought attorney's fees and penalties of up to
$100 a day from her termination of employment. (A plan administrator that fails to notify qualified
beneficiaries of their COBRA election rights within 14 days of being notified of the qualifying event may be
liable for statutory penalties of up to $100 per day from the date of failure under ERISA. See &#182;1317
and 1520.) <P>

Kost contended that: (1) in addition to the computer tape error, UPS erred in failing to input her separation
information into the computer promptly after the separation; (2) a UPS supervisor forged her signature on
the company's employee separation form; and (3) had she received a COBRA notice on a timely basis and
elected COBRA coverage, she would have had to pay a monthly premium of about $240. However, Kost did
not claim that she or any dependents incurred any uninsured medical expenses during the 18-month period
in which she could have received COBRA coverage. <P>

<H3>Court Said Kost Not Injured in Any Way</H3><P>

In reaching its decision in favor of UPS and Aetna, the court indicated that whether to assess a penalty for
failing to provide a COBRA notice rested solely within its discretion. The court noted that in making such a
determination, it could consider factors such as the magnitude of prejudice or injuries incurred by the
plaintiff and whether the plan administrator's action showed bad faith.<P>

To that end, the court pointed out that Kost did not claim to have been prejudiced or injured by not being
informed of her COBRA rights. "In fact, there appear to be no damages whatsoever," the court stated.<P>

The court also determined that there was no bad faith attributable either to UPS or Aetna. The court noted
that UPS's failure to input Kost's separation information into the computer in a timely fashion did not "rise
to the level of bad faith; it merely demonstrates bureaucratic bungling of the papers."<P>

Furthermore, the court noted that Kost's allegation that her signature was forged on the separation
form--which is translated into computer tape and sent to Aetna for COBRA notification purposes--"has no
bearing" on why she never received a COBRA notice. In fact, the court indicated that the "forgery would
actually have advanced COBRA notification, not hindered it." Although the forgery may have been
committed for "some other nefarious purpose," the court determined that it did not show that UPS acted in
bad faith. <P>

UPS's system for COBRA notifications did fail, according to the court. Basically, Kost's COBRA notice
appeared to have fallen through the cracks in the UPS system. However, the court emphasized that UPS
took immediate remedial steps to correct its mistakes by offering to provide retroactive coverage and to
pay 17 months of COBRA premiums. Moreover, Kost did not suffer any injuries and was not prejudiced by
the lack of timely notice. <P>

The court agreed with UPS and Aetna that Kost's claim was "an unabashed effort to exploit [their]
inadvertent error into a windfall award of discretionary penalties and costs," and that it would not "be a
party to such an unscrupulous cause." <P>

<HR>

<CENTER><H4>Practice Pointer</H4><P>
</CENTER>
<FONT SIZE="2">In the <I>Kost</I> case, Aetna, which was the claims administrator, provided the written COBRA election notices. However, note that under COBRA, an employer has 30 days to notify the plan administrator of a qualifying event, who in turn then has 14 days to provide the qualified beneficiary with a COBRA election notice. Therefore, UPS--as the technical plan administrator--had the ultimate responsibility to ensure that COBRA notices were sent on a timely basis. (See &#182;1311 and &#182;1313 of the <I>Handbook</I>.) <P>
</FONT><HR>

<CENTER><H4>Practice Pointer</H4></CENTER><P>

<FONT SIZE="2">The <I>Kost</I> case demonstrates out how important it is for employers to make sure that they have established comprehensive COBRA notification systems. Given the possibilities of human error, mistakes will happen in COBRA administration. But if an employer has an adequate COBRA notification system in place and a notice falls through the cracks, this case points out that courts will give an administrator the benefit of the doubt.<P>

However, administrators should not forget that other courts have not been so kind. In fact, in other COBRA cases courts assessed COBRA notice penalties against plan administrators even though the qualified beneficiary did not want or need COBRA coverage. (See &#182;1520.) In these cases, the administrative system was either deficient or non-existent, and the court determined that it would be appropriate to penalize the administrator to emphasize the importance of compliance with COBRA's requirements. <P>

<title>Federal District Courts Base FLSA Rulings Against State Employees
on Supreme Court Seminole Decision</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/person/fair/fairhead.gif"></center>
<P>
<h2>Federal District Courts Base FLSA Rulings Against State Employees on Supreme
Court Seminole Decision </h2>

Two district courts recently dismissed claims filed by state employees against
their employers under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), ruling that the
Supreme Court's decision in <I>Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida</I> (116 S. Ct. 1114
(1996)) protected states from private actions by state employees brought in
federal court. (See <I>Current Developments,</I> September 1996, page 7.)<P>

In <I>Seminole,</I> a five-justice majority of the Supreme Court struck down a provision
of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) (25 U.S.C. &#167;2710(d)(7)), which
was passed by Congress under the Indian Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The
provision required states to negotiate in good faith with Native American tribes
to enter into tribal-state compacts governing conduct of gaming activities on
Indian reservations. The provision also gave federal courts jurisdiction over
causes of action brought by Native American tribes to enforce the states'
obligation to negotiate such compacts.<P>

Pursuant to the provision, the Seminole tribe sued the state of Florida and its
governor for injunctive relief to force the governor and the state to enter into
negotiations for a tribal-state compact on gaming. However, the Supreme Court
ruled that Florida and its governor were immune from such a suit pursuant to the
11th Amendment.<P>

<H3>Highway Patrol Employees</H3>

In <I>Whitesell v. Moore,</I> No. 5:96-CV-292-BR2 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 14, 1996), Robert
Whitesell, an employee of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, filed charges
against the state and the state's secretary of crime control and public safety,
claiming he was misclassified as exempt under the FLSA and was owed compensation
for overtime hours worked for the department. Citing several court rulings, the
department asked the court to dismiss Whitesell's claims, arguing that the 11th
Amendment barred FLSA claims against a state government. <P>

In <I>Edelman v. Jordan</I> (415 U.S. 651, 662-63 (1974)), one case cited by the
defendants, the Supreme Court ruled that a state's own citizens or the citizens
of another state may not file suit against the state for money damages under the
11th Amendment. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals extended this protection to
state officers acting in their official capacity, ruling that such a claim
against a state official was essentially a claim against the state (<I>Gray v. Laws,</I>
51 F.3d 426, 430 (1995)). Further, in <I>Seminole,</I> the Supreme Court held that
states "may not be sued in federal court unless they consent to it in unequivocal
terms or unless Congress, pursuant to a valid exercise of power, unequivocally
expresses its intent to abrogate the immunity."<P>

The district court in <I>Whitesell</I> noted that Congress passed the FLSA under its
authority granted in the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution. However,
the Supreme Court in <I>Seminole</I> "overruled prior case law and held that 'Article I
[the Interstate Commerce Clause] cannot be used to circumvent the constitutional
limitation placed upon federal jurisdiction,'" the district court stated.<P>

Moreover, because the FLSA was established under Congress' Interstate Commerce
Clause authority, the law cannot dismiss the state's 11th Amendment immunity.
"Plaintiff cannot raise his claim against defendants, a state and its officer
acting in his official capacity, in this court," the district court ruled.<P>

The plaintiff acknowledged that <I>Seminole</I> prevented "Congress from granting him a
right to sue defendants." However, he argued that the state and its official
"implicitly" relinquished their immunity under the 11th Amendment "by choosing to
comply with FLSA and causing its employees to legitimately rely on that
compliance."<P>

To decide the question, the district court again turned to the <I>Seminole</I> decision.
The Supreme Court in <I>Seminole</I> held that to determine whether Congress properly
has abrogated the states' sovereign immunity, two questions must be asked:<P>

<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
	<LI>has Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the immunity; and
	<LI>has Congress acted pursuant to a valid exercise of power?<P>
</OL>

Using this standard, the court concluded that the state's compliance with the
FLSA was not voluntary, but required by Congress. The district court therefore
found that "defendants have not 'unequivocally' waived their 11th Amendment
immunity."<P>

<H3>New York State Employees</H3>

In the second case, <I>Close v. State of New York,</I> No. 94-CV-0906, 1996 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 12330 (Aug. 19, 1996), 404 employees of the state alleged they were not
paid for overtime hours worked under the FLSA. They sought compensation for the
overtime, liquidated damages and attorneys' fees.<P>

In February 1996 the U.S. District Court for Northern New York issued a
memorandum decision and order holding that the state had violated the FLSA for
not properly compensating its employees for overtime hours worked. However, the
state recently filed a motion to dismiss the case and vacate the previous ruling
under the Supreme Court's Seminole finding, claiming the district court did not
have jurisdiction to hear the case. <P>

The state employees argued that the <I>Seminole</I> decision did not change a state's
responsibilities under the Interstate Commerce Clause; <I>Seminole</I> only dismissed
state's 11th Amendment immunity under the Indian Commerce Clause, the plaintiffs
said. However, the court stated that "the Indian Commerce Clause is a greater
transfer of power from the states to the federal government than is the
Interstate Commerce Clause," and dismissed that portion of the employees'
argument.<P>

Responding to the employees' second claim that the state had relinquished its
immunity by consenting to the suit, the court responded that "judicial
recognition of constructive waiver has been extremely rare." Only when Congress
clearly indicates its intent to make states responsible in federal court for
certain actions, and the state "voluntarily chooses" to undertake such actions,
can states waive their 11th Amendment immunity, the court noted. "This is not a
situation where a state knew beforehand that an inevitable cost of engaging in an
activity and deriving its benefits was consent to be sued," the court ruled.<P>

The plaintiffs also claimed that the United States Code allowed actions under the
FLSA "against an employer (including a public agency) in any federal or state
court of competent jurisdiction" (29 U.S.C. &#167;216(b)), calling into question
the constitutionality of the FLSA as it applies to states. Therefore, according
to plaintiffs, the U.S. Attorney General must certify the FLSA constitutionality
issue before the court can proceed. The district court responded that "because
the constitutional issue is so clear in this case following the Supreme Court's
ruling in <I>Seminole Tribe,</I> however, there is no reason for the court to await the
outcome of the certification."<P>

The district court followed the <I>Seminole</I> ruling, stating that it "no longer [had]
subject-matter jurisdiction over the state's violation of the Fair Labor
Standards Act," and vacated its memorandum decision against the state.  <P>

<h2>'One Plan' Guidance to Help Consolidate Response Plans</h2>

<P>
New emergency planning guidance, known informally as the "one plan," is now available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to help facilities consolidate multiple emergency response plans into one functional "integrated contingency plan" (ICP) (61 FR 28642, June 5).
</P>

<P>
"The National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Planning Guidance" is designed to assist facilities with creating a single plan that demonstrates compliance with federal emergency planning requirements under nine existing regulatory programs (administered by five federal agencies).
</P>

<P>
EPA, in its role as chair of the National Response Team (NRT), coordinated preparation of the guidance, which was spurred by EPA's 1994 report to Congress, <I>A Review of Federal Authorities for Hazardous Materials Accident Safety</I> (see <I>Risk Management Program</I> newsletter, April 1994, p. 1). 
</P>

<P>
That report recommended, among other things, that the NRT examine "the different federal requirements for facility contingency planning to determine the desirability of a federal baseline standard to which additional, and necessary component features could be added."
</P>

<P>
In the guidance, EPA points out that the "one plan" does not change existing regulatory requirements and does not impose any new ones. Rather, "it provides a format for organizing and presenting material currently required by the regulations," EPA states. Also, facilities are not required to adhere to the guidance and may continue to maintain multiple plans, although the integrated plan is a "preferable alternative." 
</P>

<P>
The organization of an ICP, as recommended in the nonmandatory guidance, consists of: an introductory section that addresses the plan's scope and provides facility identification information; a core plan section that describes a facility's essential emergency response procedures, functions and management system; and a series of annexes that contain more details on specific topics such as emergency response training, a facility's incident command system, data on existing hazards at a facility and incident documentation.
</P>

<P>
"The use of a single emergency response plan per facility will eliminate confusion for facility first responders who often must decide which of their plans is applicable to a particular emergency," EPA states in the guidance. "The ICP concept should also allow coordination of facility plans with plans that are maintained by local emergency planning committees, area committees [pursuant to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990], cooperatives and mutual aid organizations."
</P>

<P>
According to NRT and the five federal agencies that administer emergency response planning rules, "one plans" prepared in the guidance's format "will be acceptable and be the federally preferred method of response planning."
</P>

<P>
Included as part of the guidance is an outline of a model ICP, with descriptions of the types of information that should be incorporated into each element of a plan.
</P>

<P>
Also, because facilities that utilize the ICP approach still must cross-reference elements of their "one plan" with existing regulatory requirements (so that reviewers can verify compliance), the guidance provides two matrices to help with this process. One of the matrices aligns current regulations with each ICP element, allowing plan drafters to refer to the matrix to identify specific regulatory requirements that apply to each element.
</P>

<P>
In constructing an ICP, the guidance notes that facility planners "need to find the right balance between the amount of information contained in the core plan versus the response critical annexes." Facilities with fewer hazards may choose to place most of its information in the core plan, while facilities with multiple hazards likely will include more information in the annexes.
</P>

<P>
According to the guidance, the core plan should include the essential steps necessary to initiate, conduct and terminate an emergency response action. It also "should provide information that is time critical in the earliest stages of a response and a framework to guide responders through key steps necessary to mount an effective response." The use of checklists and flowcharts is recommended to best convey the information, the guidance states.
</P>

<P>
The annexes to an ICP should augment, rather than duplicate, core plan information, according to the guidance. In addition to sections on detailed notification and response procedures, the annexes "should also address issues related to post-accident investigation, incident history, written follow-up reports, training and exercises, plan critique and modification process, prevention, and regulatory compliance, as appropriate."
</P>

<P>
For copies of the ICP guidance, call the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know hotline at (800) 424-9346. The guidance also is available electronically from the Internet home page of EPA's Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office. The address is: <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/swercepp/">http://www.epa.gov/swercepp/</A>.

Consent Order Effective Tool for Coordinating Corrective Action Programs</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<H2>Consent Order Effective Tool for Coordinating Corrective Action Programs</h2>
<P>

At many facilities subject to RCRA corrective action 
requirements, implementation of a corrective action 
program must be coordinated with the requirements of 
other environmental regulatory programs. For example, 
a RCRA permit may require the implementation of an 
Interim Corrective Measure (ICM) for groundwater. While 
the RCRA permit requires and governs the implementation 
of the ICM, it does not, in many instances, deal specifically 
with the treatment and discharge or disposal of the 
groundwater. The RCRA permit can, therefore, create 
a domino type effect, impacting the facility's wastewater 
treatment requirements, impacting the permit requirements 
of the facility, and perhaps leading to significant 
compliance issues. These non-compliance issues can 
manifest themselves in agency enforcement actions or 
citizen suits.<P>

Facilities should not have to &quot;choose their poison&quot;; 
that is, a facility should not be put into a position 
of risking non-compliance under one regulatory program 
as a consequence of complying with another. A mechanism, 
such as a Consent Order, that facilitates coordination 
among relevant regulatory programs can be useful in 
this regard.<P>

<h3>Consent Order Specifics</h3><P>

Consent Orders, which involve multiple regulatory programs, 
can be used to address these concerns to the satisfaction 
of facility owners and regulators. For example, such 
a comprehensive consent order can be used to coordinate 
short- and long-term implementation of a ground water 
ICM with upgrades to a wastewater treatment plant. 
If implementation of the ICM is a priority, the order 
can allow non-compliance with a C Permit, while upgrades 
are implemented that allow for discharges that will 
comply with the facility's permit.<P>

A Comprehensive Order also can provide a basis for coordinating 
a cross-media remediation program. In a sense, such 
an Order allows the agency to prioritize the issues 
to be addressed, recognizing that significant corrective 
action programs often impact other regulatory programs, 
such as air and water. In particular, the Order can 
allow the agency to look at a facility as a whole, 
and not just from a RCRA perspective, to determine 
which concerns pose the greatest risk and to ensure 
that the facility addresses those concerns and regulatory 
issues first.<P>

There may be significant benefits to coordinating compliance 
under an umbrella consent order. For example, while 
permits usually do not include a force majeure provision 
excusing non-compliance for reason beyond the permitee's 
control, these provisions are common in consent orders. 
With proper structuring of a Comprehensive Order, non-compliance 
with a permit may be subject to a force majeure provision 
of the Order. Additionally, since most Consent Orders 
are considered enforcement-type activity, they may 
insulate a facility owner from a citizen suit for past 
or prospective compliance matters that are subject 
to the Order.<P>

There are, of course, costs associated with a Comprehensive 
Order as well. Such an order can require the facility 
owner to commit to a very broad compliance program. 
In addition, the ability of a facility owner to negotiate 
matters covered by the Order can be very limited once 
the Order becomes effective. Consequently, unless there 
is a sufficient degree of specificity in the Order, 
in fulfilling its all of its specifications, a facility 
owner may suffer unexpected expenses.<P>

<title>IRS Releases Expedited Claims Procedures for Educational Assistance Tax Refunds</title>

<h2>IRS Releases Expedited Claims Procedures for Educational Assistance Tax Refunds</h2>

<P>
<B><I>W-2c Filing Requirement Disappoints Employers</I></B>
</P>

<P>
The IRS has published guidance on how to claim refunds for federal income taxes withheld on educational assistance benefits received during the temporary lapse of Code Section 127 in 1995 and 1996.
</P>

<P>
The guidance, released Aug. 23, 1996 (in IRS News Release 96-36), includes general information on correction procedures and refund claims. It is similar to guidance published after the exclusion's last reinstatement in 1993 (see &#182;704 of the <I>Handbook</I>).
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Employers Wanted Simple Procedures</H3>
</P>

<P>
The Section 127 exclusion expired on Dec. 31, 1994. The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-188) retroactively reinstated the exclusion from Jan. 1, 1995, through June 30, 1997.
</P>

<P>
Before this recent guidance, many employers had hoped the IRS would issue special procedures for simplifying the correction process for 1995 and 1996 reporting and withholding errors involving educational assistance benefits. And in fact, lawmakers did recognize the need for such procedures. For the first time in the exclusion's expiration-extension cycle, Congress included language in the statute urging the IRS to do so.
</P>

<P>
The IRS, however, didn't relax the current correction procedures, but instead is requiring employers to prepare W-2c forms.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Tax Refund Procedures for Employees</H3>
</P>

<P>
Eligible employees must apply for refunds of federal, state and local income taxes previously withheld on their 1995 educational assistance benefits. The IRS will not automatically refund these taxes.
</P>

<P>
To get a refund, an employee must file a 1995 W-2c form (the Statement of Corrected Income and Tax Amounts) and a 1040X form (the Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return).
</P>

<P>
Employers should use the W-2c to show taxable wages after excluding any educational assistance benefits received in 1995 (up to $5,250).
</P>

<P>
For example, Sam, an employee at XYZ Co., earned $25,000 in 1995. That same year, Sam also received $3,000 in educational assistance benefits.
</P>

<P>
XYZ's original W-2 form issued to Sam would have shown total taxable wages of $28,000 ($25,000 plus $3,000). The revised W-2c, however, would show corrected total taxable wages of only $25,000.
</P>

<P>
Ordinarily, when filing a 1040X, an employee must answer all questions on corrections to the original tax return. To streamline and expedite the refund process, the IRS has simplified the required information. Now, an employee need only:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>include name, address and Social Security number;
	<LI>write "1995 Tax Year" on the 1040X;
	<LI>sign the form; and
	<LI>attach a W-2c.
</UL>
<P>
In addition, an employee should write "IRC 127" in the top margin of the 1040X.
</P>

<P>
In some cases, refund claims for taxes withheld on educational assistance benefits could involve several other steps. For example, if an employee's 1995 income drops below $26,672 after subtracting educational assistance benefits from total taxable wages, the employee could be eligible for the Earned Income Credit.
</P>

<P>
Refunds of Social Security and Medicare taxes will depend in part on how an employer handles these situations.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Tax Refund Procedures for Employers</H3>
</P>

<P>
The IRS did not change existing procedures employers must follow to claim refunds and credits for tax overpayments. IRS publication <I>Circular E</I> (the <I>Employers Tax Guide</I>) summarizes these procedures.
</P>

<P>
To get a refund, employers should use Form 843 to claim refunds of Social Security and Medicare taxes paid on educational assistance benefits and Form 941 to claim credits for these overpaid taxes.
</P>

<P>
Both the refund and credit procedures have advantages and drawbacks. Employers seeking refunds will receive interest on overpaid taxes. But, because employers already must file the Form 941 with the IRS each quarter, recording the additional information required for an educational assistance tax credit should be simpler than filing the additional Form 843.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Filing Assistance</H3>
</P>

<P>
Call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040 to learn more about procedures for claiming educational assistance refunds. To request forms, such as the 1040X, call 1-800-TAX-FORM.
</P>

<P>
For a complete explanation of refund and credit procedures for taxes paid on educational assistance benefits, see this month's updates to &#182;704 and Appendix C of the <I>Handbook</I>.

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Resolving Conflicting Expiration Dates</H4>

<FONT SIZE="2"><P>
How does Congress rectify a legislative discrepancy such as the educational assistance exclusion's two expiration dates? It usually enacts a technical correction.
</P>

<P>
Technical corrections resolve legislative "errors" -- that is, statutes that clearly conflict with what Congress intended. Legislative errors have many causes. Congressional staff preparing a bill for the president's signature sometimes make typographical or transcription mistakes. Given the breakneck speed at which they worked in August to prepare several major bills, errors are understandable, and surprisingly few and far between.
</P>

<P>
Unfortunately, the exclusion's competing expiration dates is one of these errors. Although the statute provides two expiration dates -- May 31, 1997, and June 30, 1997 -- the conference report to the statute, which outlines congressional intent, clearly establishes only one expiration date -- May 31, 1997.
</P>

<P>
Will the 104th Congress enact a technical correction resolving the exclusion's conflicting expiration dates? Probably not. House and Senate leaders have indicated that they will not work on any major legislation before adjourning in late September. The new 105th Congress, which will convene in January 1997, could introduce a technical correction, but any bill that the correction becomes attached to likely will not come up for a vote for several months.
</P>

<P>
Until Congress resolves the issue, educational assistance plan administrators are permitted to follow the expiration date provided in the bill signed into law by the president -- June 30, 1997.

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/enviro/blst/blsthead.gif" alt="Risk Management Program Handbook"><h4> <i>Accidental Release Prevention Under the 1990 Clean Air Act </i></h4></center><hr> 

<h2>EPA, OSHA Make Progress On Joint Investigation Plans</h2>

<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are progressing with plans to share chemical accident investigation duties, and EPA officials recently unveiled blueprints for investigation protocol, training and development of products to guide accident investigators.
</P>

<P>
EPA and OSHA last year were charged with taking over many of the duties of the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, which the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 authorized, but the Clinton Administration has declined to fund (see <I>Risk Management Program</I> newsletter, February 1995, p. 1). The board is authorized by law to investigate major chemical accidents at stationary sources and issue reports and recommendations.
</P>

<P>
According to David Speights, associate director of EPA's Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office, the agency had been building up its investigation capabilities over the past several years in anticipation of working with the board on cases and providing technical support. For example, EPA has gained experience from its ongoing chemical safety audit program, which consists of agency audits of prevention programs and emergency response planning at facilities that have experienced chemical releases.
</P>

<P>
OSHA, on the other hand, has been investigating major chemical incidents for a number of years, and since 1992 has been applying the process safety management standard as an enforcement tool in its investigations. However, these investigations, which typically require three to four months of onsite work, are resource-intensive and can require extensive testing, use of expert analysis and storage space for evidence, said Mike Marshall, incident investigation team leader with OSHA.
EPA's investigation tools
</P>

<P>
To further build its expertise and catch up with OSHA, Speights said that over the past couple of years, EPA has been conducting several "pilot" investigations to learn the intricacies of reviewing major chemical accidents. Also, the agency has been working to put together several tools to help with investigations, including:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
	<LI>a legal authority handbook that pieces together from various statutes the parameters of EPA's investigation authority (EPA does not have the same explicit authority granted to the board);
</P>
<P>
	<LI>guidances used in specific industries to support accident history and background research;
</P>
<P>
	<LI>a list of analysis and testing facilities to use during investigations; 
</P>
<P>
	<LI>technical assistance subcontracts with technical experts that have chemical industry, refinery and fire prevention backgrounds; and
</P>
<P>
	<LI>an in-house legal and technical assistance team.
</P>
</UL>

<P>
Currently, EPA has the resources to participate in approximately five major chemical incident investigations per year and has informed Clinton Administration officials that it could gear up to participate in 20 investigations annually, Speights said.
</P>

<P>
EPA's first full investigation involved the Dec. 13, 1994, incident at the Terra Industries Inc. plant in Port Neal, Iowa. An initial investigation report was released by EPA in January (see <I>Risk Management Program</I> newsletter, February 1996, p. 2) and Speights said it currently is being reviewed by an outside, five-member expert review panel. "EPA anticipates using these types of panels for all its chemical incident investigations," he said.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Pool resources, work on protocol</H3>
</P>

<P>
One of the goals of both EPA and OSHA is to effectively pool resources and conduct joint investigations of major chemical accidents at facilities across the country. For example, in response to the April 21, 1995, explosion and fire at the Napp Technologies plant in Lodi, N.J., EPA and OSHA informally coordinated a joint investigation and plan to issue a joint report this fall. 
</P>

<P>
However, the experience highlighted the need for more formal procedures to address investigation logistics. As a result, the two agencies currently are working on a protocol to outline the tasks of each agency during a joint investigation, as well as determine which other agencies can be involved, Speights said. For example, EPA would like to involve state agencies as members of a single, joint investigation of each incident, but some states have preferred not to participate, he said.
</P>

<P>
In addition to working on the protocol, EPA and OSHA plan to define a "large catastrophic event," which may act as the "trigger" that will require or allow a joint investigation. Also, the two agencies have completed an initial draft of a formal memorandum of understanding on joint investigations, OSHA's Marshall said.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Cooperative approach</H3>
</P>

<P>
One problem that the two federal agencies will be struggling with as they perform joint investigations is that, by law, OSHA is required to issue any citations within six months of an inspection, Speights said. Thus, companies have an interest in forcing OSHA to complete investigations within six months. 
</P>

<P>
However, EPA is looking at taking a more cooperative approach with companies as it plans investigations, he said. For example, EPA may consider asking a company to waive the six-month requirement so that OSHA and EPA can jointly investigate for root causes and basically put the enforcement approach on hold. But EPA does not yet know whether companies will buy into this, EPA's Speights said.
</P>

<P>
To help improve cooperation among parties to an accident investigation, the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Decision Sciences held a roundtable discussion in June with the many stakeholders in chemical accident investigations--EPA, OSHA, labor unions, insurance companies and the chemical industry--to circulate ideas related to finding the cause of accidents, learning from investigations and sharing results with stakeholders. The roundtable also addressed two conflicting goals of accident investigation: developing evidence to support litigation versus finding the actual cause and freely sharing investigation results.
</P>

<P>
Finally, EPA and OSHA are planning several "information products" that will be developed from the lessons learned in investigations, including: alerts that focus on what happened and the steps that others can take to reduce risks; full reports on each incident investigated; and other guidance. "Findings from investigations likely will make their way into EPA's guidance documents under the RMP rule, revisions to model RMP plans and, if necessary, through rulemaking," Speights said. 
</P>

<TITLE>DOL Finalizes Plan Asset Regulations</TITLE>

<h2>DOL Finalizes Plan Asset Regulations </h2>
 
<P><B><I>Pension Payback Program Also Expanded</I></B></P>

<P>Last month, the Department of Labor (DOL) issued the final rule that defines when employers should deposit plan assets, and expanded its Pension Payback Program to encourage more employers to "pay back" missed employee pension plan contributions without incurring civil penalties or federal criminal prosecution.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Final Plan Asset Regulations</H3>

<P>Under the final plan asset regulations issued Aug. 2, employers must deposit employee
contributions to defined contribution plans within 15 business days following the last day of the month in which the contributions are withheld from pay or received by the employers.</P>

<P>The final regulations amend the current rules, which required employers to deposit the
contributions as soon as possible, but no later than 90 days after they are made by plan participants.
</P>

<P>The change will take effect on Feb. 3, 1997. The final rule, published in the Aug. 7 <I>Federal Register</I>, applies to all types of pension plans covered by ERISA, including 401(k) plans and profit-sharing plans. In a change from the proposed rules, the final version will not apply to ERISA health plans.</P>

<P>According to Labor Secretary Robert Reich, the change is being made because some employers have been using contributions as an "interest-free revolving loan fund" during the 90-day period. Shortening the waiting period, he added, "takes away the temptation to divert the money."</P>

<P>"As the [401(k)] system grows so quickly," Reich said, "it's not surprising that there's going to be some rotten apples."</P>

<P>The final regulation provides that participant contributions become plan assets on the earliest date that they can be reasonably segregated from the employer's general assets (as under the current rules), but in no event later than the 15th business day of the month following the month in which the participant contributions are withheld or received by the employer. This is significantly shorter than the current 90-day limit, but more generous than the DOL's proposed rule. That proposed rule was based on IRS payroll withholding rules, and would have required participant contributions to be segregated and placed in trust within just a few days in certain instances. (For an analysis of the proposed rules, see the February 1996 issue of <I>Current Developments</I>, p. 1.)</P>

<P>According to the final rules, an employer may obtain a 10-day extension of the deadline with respect to participant contributions received or withheld in a single month.</P>

<P>The final rules also do not affect the ability of cafeteria plan sponsors to rely on a 1992 DOL technical release that specifies that DOL will not enforce ERISA's requirement that plan assets must be placed in trust in cases involving cafeteria plans.</P>

<P><H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Employer Concerns About Deposit Time</H3></P>

<P>After the proposed rule was issued in December 1995, more than 500 employers sent comments to the DOL criticizing the proposal. Common complaints included:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>

<LI>The proposed contribution process will be too complex to conduct weekly or
biweekly, because segregating and allocating employee contributions require coordination among many different parties and administrative systems.<P>

<LI>The change will be costly for employees in the long run, as the costs of implementing the changes
would be borne by the employees, who would then contribute less to their benefit plans.<P>

<LI>The change will be too radical for a problem that is not widespread, and it will penalize plans that are now in compliance by saddling them with new implementation costs.<P></UL>

<P>Olena Berg, assistant secretary of labor for pension and welfare benefits, estimated that 94 percent of employers should be able to comply immediately with the rule.</P>

<P>The 180-day waiting period before implementation should give the other 6 percent of employers enough time to make the necessary adjustments, she added.</P>

<P>Moreover, Reich said that according to the DOL's own "conservative" estimate, employees as a group would gain $75 million in interest on contributions in 1997 under the new rule, since employers would be depositing the money in accounts sooner.</P>

<P>The final rule was released as this supplement to the <I>Handbook</I> went to print. More detailed coverage of the rule will be provided in next month's issue of <I>Current Developments</I>.</P>

<P><H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Extended Pension Payback Program</H3></P>

<P>The DOL has also published a class exemption that would extend the time frame and amend other aspects of the Pension Payback Program, the department's recent amnesty program for employers who miss pension plan contributions.</P>

<P>Under the program, employers who restore delinquent participant contributions plus lost earnings on these delinquent contributions to pension plans will not incur criminal penalties under ERISA for failing to deposit employee contributions, and will not be subject to penalties assessed by the IRS for participating in prohibited transactions. The U.S. Justice Department has lent its support to this program.</P>

<P>In the earlier program, the amnesty "window" extended from March 7, 1996, to Sept. 7, 1996. The amendment published Aug. 2 opens this window even more -- back to Nov. 28, 1995. Restored payments must relate to amounts paid by participants or withheld from their wages for contributions to pension plans no later than April 6, 1996. The previous program applied only to pension plan contributions paid by participants or withheld by an employer from participants' wages on or before April 5, 1996. (See the April 1996 issue of <I>Current Developments</I>, p. 1, for a more detailed description of the program.)</P>

<P>To accommodate this recent expansion, the DOL has announced that for restorations that occurred between Nov. 28, 1995, but before March 7, 1996, the total outstanding delinquent participant contributions on the Nov. 28 date, excluding earnings, must not have exceeded the aggregate participant contributions received or withheld from the employees' wages for the 12 calendar months immediately preceding November 1995.</P>

<P>Employers wishing to participate in this payback program must notify, in writing, the DOL's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, in Washington, D.C., no later than Sept. 7, 1996. This notification must include certain documentation.</P>

<P>For more information, contact Jeffrey Monhart, pension investigator, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC; 202/219-4377.</P>

<Title> Proposed placement of autistic boy in self-contained classroom violates
IDEA, court rules<P></Title>
</head>

<body background="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<h2>Proposed placement of autistic boy in self-contained classroom violates IDEA,
court rules<P></h2>
A Virginia school system has been ordered by the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia to educate an autistic boy in regular education
classrooms because its proposed special education placement would deny him a
free, appropriate public education.<P>
The Loudoun County, Va., board of education proposed placing Mark Hartmann, an
11-year-old boy, in special education after a year of including him in one of its
regular classrooms. Hartmann challenged the decision, alleging that it violated
section 504 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). However,
a hearing officer determined that the district's proposed placement did not
violate its obligation to educate him, to the maximum extent appropriate, with
nondisabled children.<P>
The court reversed, finding that the board's efforts to include Mark were
inadequate. Although the board hired a full-time, personal aide to assist
Hartmann, the court held that it failed to follow the advice of qualified experts
who favored Hartmann's continued inclusion. <P>
Instead, it placed on his individualized education program team staff persons
"who had inadequate training and experience" about educating autistic children in
an inclusive setting, "thereby dooming their inclusion efforts to failure."<P>
Hartmann could receive significant educational benefits in a regular education as
long as he has the help of an aide and properly adapted curriculum, the court
determined. It noted that at least two school systems had successfully
"mainstreamed" Hartmann, citing evidence that he could do simple addition and
subtraction by the end of fourth grade. He also could point correctly to pictures
of the appropriate coins when asked to give his aide 35 cents.<P>
The district argued that special education was appropriate because Hartmann was
not working at his age level. The court disagreed, saying, "Mark is learning in
the inclusive setting and he has more chance of fulfilling his unknown potential
in such a setting than in the less enriched one of the self-contained class."<P>
Although he had some behavioral problems while attending a Loudoun district
school, the court found that, without heeding the advice of experts, the district
was unable to provide successful behavior modification strategies. Hartmann's
behavior improved greatly after he left Loudoun's school and was mainstreamed in
another district, the court also found.<P>
The court cautioned that its holding was limited to what was in Hartmann's best
interest and did not sanction inclusive education for all autistic children. The
court analyzed the case primarily under the IDEA, but concluded it would enjoin
"further violations of the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act." This case is
<i>Hartmann v. Loudoun County Board of Education,</i> Appendix IV:617.

<title>EMS Personnel Do Not Qualify for 207(k) Exemption, District Court Rules</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/person/fair/fairhead.gif"></center>
<P>
<h2>EMS Personnel Do Not Qualify for 207(k) Exemption, District Court Rules</h2>

Emergency medical service (EMS) personnel working for a county 	do not qualify for the partial
overtime exemption under 207(k) of 	the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) because they failed to meet
the applicable regulatory test, the U.S. District Court for South Carolina ruled May 13 (<I>Roy v. County of
Lexington</I>, Case Number: 3:93-2292-19, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7718). The court also found that the
employees' meal periods and sleep time were noncompensable under the act.<P>

The EMS staff is one of five departments within the Lexington County's public safety division. The county
was subdivided into nine response areas, with a staff of EMS personnel assigned to each specific substation.
Although some EMS units were jointly housed with firefighting units, the two units were physically
separated by a wall. Each substation was staffed by two EMS employees on duty throughout each 24-hour
period. These EMS employees responded to calls forwarded by the county's 911 service.<P>

"The EMS teams were dispatched to fires, crime scenes, and automobile accidents whenever there was a
report of an injury, the likelihood of an injury or the dispatcher had no reliable information upon which to
determine whether an injury had occurred," the district court noted. Each team was expected to respond
within two minutes to any call within its service area. If an ambulance was already on call, however, a
neighboring EMS substation would be contacted to respond to the call.<P>

The county placed EMS employees under a 207(k) plan, paying them time and one-half for every hour
worked over 43 in a work period. The EMS employees worked on three recurring shifts of 24 1/2 hours,
which constituted a "one day on and two days off" schedule. The shift contained three meal periods, during
which employees were not to be interrupted except in the event of an emergency call. If interrupted during
a meal period, they were paid for the entire hour. They also were paid if their sleep time was interrupted,
including a full hour of compensation when even one minute of sleep was disturbed for an emergency call. If
they could not get five consecutive hours of sleep, the entire eight-hour period was compensated.<P>

EMS employees received an annual salary paid in biweekly installments. Since their schedules fluctuated
over time, they were paid one-half of their regular hourly rate for each overtime hour worked in the work
period. Because they were paid by salary rather than on an hourly basis, their regular rate of pay was
calculated by dividing the total number of compensable hours worked in the two-week pay period by their
biweekly salary.<P>

The FLSA (29 U.S.C. &#167;207(k), Appendix I, page 18) provides a partial overtime exemption for public
employees engaged in law enforcement and firefighting activities. For EMS personnel who work for an
agency independent of law enforcement or fire protection to qualify for the exemption, the employer must
meet the "substantially related" test (29 C.F.R. &#167;553. 215, Appendix II, page 86.4) and the "80/20"
rule (29 C.F.R. &#167;553.212, Appendix II, page 86.4) under the regulations, the court noted.<P>

The "substantially related" regulatory test requires an employer to prove that EMS personnel "have
received training in the rescue of fire, crime and accident victims" and "are regularly dispatched to fires,
crime scenes, riots, natural disasters and accidents." The county satisfied the first prong of the test
regarding EMS training, the court found. <P>

The county argued that it also met the second prong of the test because it dispatched EMS employees to
fires, crime scenes and automobile accidents on a regular basis. The district court did not agree. "In order
for this standard to be satisfied, logic dictates that there be some comparison of the total number of calls
of this type with the number of times that an ambulance responds to them," the court said. "Otherwise, the
word 'regularly' would add nothing to the test."<P>

Using a standard for evaluating regularity adopted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in
<I>Justice v. Metropolitan Gov't of Nashville </I>(4 F.3d 1387), the court found that about 31 percent of total
calls responded to by the county's EMS personnel were made concurrently with law enforcement and
firefighting agencies, with the remainder of calls being of a strictly medical nature with no law
enforcement or fire response. The court also noted that only 10 percent of the total number of EMS working
hours were spent on law enforcement and fire calls. The district court, therefore, concluded that the
county did not meet the "substantially related" test under the regulations.<P>

The court then turned its attention to the "80/20" rule, which requires that EMS employees spend no more
than 20 percent of their time on nonexempt activities -- that is, activities not related to law enforcement
and fire protection (i.e., medical calls). The county calculated that for a two-month period EMS employees
spent less than 16 percent of their time on medical calls. The district court accepted the formula that the
county used in its calculation, but said the county should have expanded its analysis to the six-month period
in question. Using this longer time period, the court found that the county's EMS employees spent 23
percent of their time on medical calls.<P>

The district court also questioned whether the county's estimate of time spent by EMS employees on
medical calls -- 50 minutes -- was too conservative. Rather, the court found that the average call lasted
70 minutes, which resulted in EMS personnel spending more than 20 percent of their time on strictly
medical calls. The court, therefore, concluded that the county did not meet the "80/20" rule under the
regulations. As such, the county's EMS personnel did not qualify for payment under a 207(k) plan.<P>

<H3>EMS Employees' Meal Period and Sleep Time Is Noncompensable</H3>

The regulations (29 C.F.R. &#167;785.19, Appendix II, page 132) provide that employees must be
"completely relieved from duty" during their meal periods for the time to be considered noncompensable
under the FLSA. The county's EMS employees argued that to be completely relieved from duty, employees
should not be on call. However, most courts reject this strict interpretation because "it is inconsistent with
the prevailing Supreme Court precedent which interprets the FLSA ... or because it is inconsistent with the
intent of the regulations," the district court said. The 6th Circuit adopted a more flexible approach in <I>Hill v.
United States</I> (751 F.2d 810, 814 (6th Cir. 1984),<I> cert. denied</I>, 474 U.S. 817 (1985)), ruling that an
employee is not entitled to be paid for meal time "as long as the employee can pursue his or her mealtime
adequately or comfortably, is not engaged in the performance of any substantial duties, and does not spend
time predominantly for the employee's benefit."	<P>

Applying this "predominant benefit" test, the district court concluded that the EMS workers were not
primarily engaged in work-related activities during meal periods, noting that "these employees had no
official responsibilities during this period of time other than to respond to an emergency call if called upon."
The only restriction placed on EMS employees during meal periods was that they remain within their
service area. The court concluded that the county's EMS employees "were not acting primarily for the
benefit of their employer during their meal periods," therefore, the time was noncompensable under the
act.<P>

Concerning the compensability of sleep time, the regulations (29 C.F.R. &#167;785.22, Appendix II, page
132) state that if an employee is required to be on duty 24 hours or more, the employer and the employee
may agree to exclude sleep time from hours worked. Further, if the sleep time is interrupted by a call to
duty, that time is considered hours worked. If the employee cannot get a reasonable night's sleep, the time
is compensable. For enforcement purposes, the Department of Labor (DOL) has determined that if an
employee cannot get five hours of uninterrupted sleep, the time is compensable.<P>

The employees argued that the entire period that has been designated for sleep purposes -- eight hours --
must be uninterrupted a majority of the time for the regulation to apply. The court noted that, if this
interpretation is correct, the regulation does not apply to the employees because evidence at trial
established that their sleep time was interrupted by emergency calls at least 60 percent of the time. The
county, however, argued that a reasonable night's sleep is five hours of uninterrupted sleep and that during
two of the months at issue, approximately 75 percent of the sleep periods were without interruption for
the entire eight hours or for at least five hours. The court, accepting this standard, found that the EMS
employees had "at least five hours of uninterrupted sleep during a majority of the time allocated for this
purpose."<P>

The district court also noted that although EMS personnel did not have a written agreement with the county
to exclude sleep hours from compensable hours of work, they did not challenge the county's policy through
the established grievance process nor did they complain to their supervisors about it. The district court
found that "the affected employee's failure to contest the policy within a reasonable period of time
constitutes implied consent to the sleep period exemptions." The court, therefore, ruled that the EMS
employees' sleep time was noncompensable under the act.<P>

<H3>Payment on a Fluctuating Workweek Basis</H3>

The county's EMS employees argued that they should not have been paid on the basis of a fluctuating
workweek. The court agreed, finding that there was no agreement between the employees and the employer
to pay overtime compensation at the half-time rate.<P>

The regulations (29 C.F.R. &#167;778.114, Appendix II, pages 100-101) provide that "a salaried
employee whose hours fluctuate from week to week may reach a mutual understanding with his employer
that he receive a fixed amount as straight-time pay for whatever hours he is called to work in a workweek,
whether few or many, and that he will be compensated for his overtime work at a rate of fifty percent of
his regular hourly rate." Even though the employer is not required to explain the method of half-time
calculation, "at a minimum, the employer must provide its employees with a reasonably clear and accurate
explanation of their compensation," the district court noted.<P>

When the county established its overtime policy in 1985, it circulated a memorandum, indicating that
employees would be paid overtime at time and one-half their regular rates. Although the memo was
incorrect, the error was never corrected, the court pointed out. In addition, the employee handbook
"contained arguably contradictory language about whether the EMS employees would be paid on a fluctuating
work week schedule," according to the court.<P>

EMS personnel and the county did not have a mutual understanding that overtime hours worked would be
calculated on a half-time basis, the court concluded. The county, therefore, violated the FLSA when it
compensated EMS personnel on a fluctuating workweek basis, and the employees are entitled to overtime
payment at time and one-half their regular rates for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek.<P>

The court determined that the EMS employees are entitled to overtime back wages for a period of two
years immediately prior to the filing of this action as well as prejudgment interest, attorneys fees and
costs. <P>

<P>
<h2>Clinton Pushes for Improved Consumer Protections</h2>

<P>
With the ink of his signature on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 barely dry, President Clinton recently seized upon the increased visibility of health care issues to propose or support measures that would improve consumer protections.
</P>

<P>
During a Sept. 5 speech in Florida before a group of senior citizens--a constituency with a long-standing concern about health care issues--Clinton noted that the millions of Americans affected by changes in the health care system "ought to feel comfortable about the health care they receive."
</P>

<P>
To that end, he told the group that he has asked Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala and Labor Secretary Robert Reich to form the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry. According to Clinton, the national commission will meet on a "bipartisan basis ... to evaluate the ways that health plans can best serve their customers over the long run so that we can have a health care system we can afford and one we can be proud of."
</P>

<P>
That same day, Clinton issued an executive order which provided more details on the commission.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
	<LI>It will be composed of a maximum 20 members appointed by the president. The members will be consumers, institutional health care providers, heath care professionals, other health care workers, insurers, purchasers, state and local government representatives and experts in health care quality, financing and administration. The Labor and HHS secretaries will serve as co-chairs and report to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	<LI>The commission shall advise the president on changes in the health care system and recommend any measures necessary to promote and assure health care quality and value, and protect consumers and workers in the health care system by: (1) reviewing data on consumer information and protection; (2) reviewing existing and planned work that defines, measures and promotes health care quality of health care; and (3) collecting and evaluating data on changes in availability of treatment and services.
</P>
<P>
	<LI>The commission will make a preliminary report to the president by Sept. 30, 1997. A final report will be submitted 18 months after the commission's first meeting. 
</P>
</UL>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Could Lightning Strike Twice?</H3>
</P>

<P>
Clinton, who helped revive action on the then-languishing portability bill in his State of the Union speech last January, threw his support behind another stalled measure--the Patient Right to Know Act of 1996 (H.R. 2976)--during his Florida speech.
</P>

<P>
The legislation was introduced last February and approved by the House Commerce Committee on June 27. It was also referred to three House committees--Ways and Mean, Economic and Educational Opportunities and Government Reform and Oversight. Thus far, those committees have taken no action on the bill.
</P>

<P>
Under the bill, any entity--including third-party administrators of ERISA plans--that offers a public or private health plan could not: (1) as part of any contract or agreement with a health care provider, restrict or interfere with any medical communication; or (2) on the basis of a medical communication, take any of the following actions against a provider--refuse to contract with, terminate or refuse to renew a contract, prohibit referrals to the provider, refuse to compensate for covered services, or any other retaliatory action. Any entity violating the provisions would be subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for each violation and up to $100,000 if it is determined that a "pattern of violations" exists.
</P>

<P>
The legislation was introduced by Rep. Greg Ganske, R.-Iowa, to curb the use of alleged "gag clauses" by some managed care plans, in which plan providers are prohibited from telling patients about all treatment options in an effort to curb expenditures. 
</P>

<P>
In supporting the bipartisan legislation, Clinton emphasized that he is "convinced that the right kind of managed care can really be the best of all worlds--can give more choices to consumers, can give people more chances to make decisions that are right for them, can keep the costs of health care down and still maintain very high quality." 
</P>

<P>
However, he cautioned that "some bad things can happen" that could lead to a decline in the quality of health care, such as "gagging" providers, which he said has to stop.
</P>

<P>
"Doctors just must not face discrimination when they uphold their oath to give patients the best care," said Clinton. "Patients should feel safe in the knowledge that they have been given the full story of what all their treatment options are and what are best for them. They should be told about the best treatment, whether it's the cheapest or not ..."
</P>

<P>
However, some employer groups believe that the legislation could negatively affect group health plans. At a July 30 hearing of the Ways and Means Health subcommittee, a representative from the National Business Coalition on Health noted the following employer concerns.
</P>

<OL>

	<LI>The bill fails to ensure uniformity by granting states authority to impose their separate and mutually inconsistent standards.
</P>
<P>
	<LI>The bill's "overly broad prohibitions" on oral as well as written communications would create "ambiguities" that will lead to increased litigation.
</P>
<P>
	<LI>Managed care would be eroded because, as employers lose the ability to use performance guarantees and information requirements, they would have no incentive to continue managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
	<LI>Administrative expenses would rise as plans review or renegotiate contracts, written statements and oral communications. 
</P>
</OL>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Push for Subsidies </H3>
</P>

<P>
President Clinton also expressed his support for mandatory maternity stay legislation during his Florida speech, and mentioned a health insurance subsidy proposal that appeared in his defunct balanced budget plan last year. First Lady Hillary Clinton also discussed the proposal in her Aug. 27 speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Under the plan, the federal government would provide sliding scale subsidies for up to six months to help workers and their families who are between jobs.

<title>Medicare Secondary Payer Law Trumps State Insurance Law, Federal
Appeals Court Rules</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

 Handbook"></center>
<P>
<h2>Medicare Secondary Payer Law Trumps State Insurance Law, Federal Appeals
Court Rules</h2>

State insurance laws are generally permitted by the McCarran-Ferguson Act to
remain effective when federal laws of broad application--which are often written
in expansive, sweeping terms--might otherwise inadvertently interfere with those
laws. However, one exception is when Congress has specifically chosen to deal
with state insurance law. Under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, federal law will
preempt even state insurance law if the federal law "specifically relates to the
business of insurance." <P>

That was the rationale of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in <i>United
States v. Rhode Island Insurers' Insolvency Fund</i>, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 6574
(April 5, 1996). The court determined that the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) law
does specifically relate to the insurance business, and therefore preempts a
Rhode Island state law that would have made Medicare the primary payer of $14,000
in medical claims. Moreover, according to the court, the state law and the MSP
law contain contradictory terms on the order of payment responsibility.
Therefore, the federal MSP law preempts the state law under a standard preemption
analysis. <P>

Because the state refused to voluntarily accept Medicare's status as secondary,
the award was for double damages based on provisions of the MSP law. <P>

The 1st Circuit consists of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
Puerto Rico. The decision is binding in those states and may be cited as legal
precendent by courts in other U.S. Circuits. <P>

<h3>Rhode Island Law Versus Federal Law</h3><P>

The Rhode Island Insurers' Insolvency Fund Act (RIIIFA) creates a fund to help
pay claims filed against insolvent insurers. RIIIFA provides that when an insurer
becomes insolvent, the fund is "deemed to be the insurer to the extent of the
obligations" covered under the insurer's policies. RIIIFA also contains a
nonduplication clause that requires fund claimants to first exhaust any right of
recovery under a governmental insurance plan and allows the fund to refuse to pay
amounts that are recoverable.<P>

The MSP program, enacted to lower federal Medicare payments, requires Medicare
beneficiaries to exhaust available private insurance coverage before resorting to
Medicare coverage. (See Tab 500 of the <i>Handbook.</i>) The MSP law provides
that "Medicare benefits are secondary to benefits payable by a third party payer
even if the State law . . . states that its benefits are secondary to
Medicare."<P>

The case involved three Medicare beneficiaries who were involved in automobile
accidents and received approximately $14,000 in medical benefits from Medicare.
The three filed claims against the fund because their automobile insurance
carrier was insolvent. The fund paid the claims--with the exception of the
$14,000 that had been disbursed by Medicare. When the fund refused to pay that
amount, the United States sued it in a federal district court for $28,000. The
district court found for the United States, and the fund appealed that decision
to the 1st Circuit.<P>

<h3>McCarran-Ferguson Act</h3><P>

The McCarran-Ferguson Act generally preserves for the states the ability to
regulate the business of insurance, and provides that federal law should not be
interpreted to supersede a state insurance law "unless such Act specifically
relates to the business of insurance." (See &#182;223.)<P>

After examining both the "specifically relate" and the "business of insurance"
portions of the test, the appeals court agreed with the district court that the
McCarran-Ferguson Act in this case failed to prevent the preemption of the Rhode
Island law. Noting that while the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not usually allow
for the preemption of state insurance laws, the court said that federal law may
nonetheless trump state insurance law when it is clear that Congress intended to
"inject itself into the area of state insurance law." <P>

The MSP law, the court found, does "specifically relate" to insurance because it
does not concern a rule of general application that might encompass both insurers
and non-insurers, but rather deals directly with payments under an automobile or
liability insurance policy. Moreover, the MSP law involves the "business of
insurance," because it affects the core relationship between the insurer and its
insured, the court said. Some of the core matters included in the business of
insurance, the court noted, are the type of policy that may be issued and its
reliability, interpretation and enforcement. The MSP provision prohibits private
insurers from enforcing terms which make Medicare primary, and thereby affects
the business of insurance, the court said.<P>

<h3>Same Result Under Conventional Preemption Analysis</h3><P>

The fund argued that the MSP law and the RIIIFA are compatible and therefore
federal law should not supersede state law under a standard preemption analysis.
According to the fund, MSP provides for Medicare reimbursement only if it is
reasonable to expect reimbursement to be made, and it is not reasonable to expect
the fund to pay because of its provision requiring exhaustion of governmental
insurance. The court rejected this argument, finding that if state law is
preempted, it would be reasonable to anticipate that payment would be made to
Medicare.<P>

Finally, the court rejected the fund's argument that it is government agency
rather than a policy or plan of insurance as defined under the MSP rules. By its
own terms, the court said, the RFIIIA deemed the fund to be the insurer, and
therefore the fund is considered a primary plan under the MSP provisions and
regulations. <P>

<h2> Status of OMB Policies</h2>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>OMB Circular A-133, <I>Audits of Institutions of Higher Education
and Other Non-Profit Institutions</I></H3>

<P>
OMB has proposed revisions to Circular A-133 that would bring state and local governments under the circular, permit biennial audits in certain circumstances and address the allowability of audit costs for subrecipients. The proposal was published in the Nov. 5, 1996, <i>Federal Register</i>, and comments are due to OMB by Jan. 6, 1997. OMB plans to rescind Circular A-128, <i>Audits of State and
Local Governments</i>, when the proposal is finalized. These changes would fully implement the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (P.L. 104-156), which applies to audits of fiscal years ending after June 30, 1996. Many of the new statutory requirements had already been incorporated into Circular A-133 when OMB revised it in April 1996. <A HREF="/tpg/fed_gts/cope/cope_a133.html">Click here to retrieve the proposal.</A></P>


<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>OMB Compliance Supplement</H3>
</P>

<P>
OMB plans to issue an initial draft of an updated compliance supplement that is used by auditors performing single audits and other financial and compliance audits of federal assistance recipients. The new compliance supplement will incorporate provisions of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, as well as OMB Circular A-133. As the revision progresses, up-to-date information on the status of the proposal will be provided here by the editors of the <I>Resource Guide to Federal Program Compliance Audits</I>.

</P>

<P>
<B>AGENCY:</B> Office of Management and Budget
</P>

<P>
<B>ACTION:</B> Proposed Revision of OMB Circular No. A-133 and Proposed Rescission
of OMB Circular No. A-128
</P>

<HR>
<P>
<B>SUMMARY:</B> This Notice offers interested parties an opportunity to comment on further proposed revisions to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-133, "Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Institutions," and the proposed consolidation of OMB Circular No. A-128, "Audits of State and Local Governments," into Circular No. A-133 (with Circular A-128 being rescinded). This Notice also requests comment on two proposed information collections contained in the proposed revision to Circular A-133. These actions are being proposed to implement the Single
Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (1996 Amendments), which were signed into law on July 5, 1996 (P.L. 104-156).
</P>

<P>
In the proposed revisions to Circular A-133, as published in the <I>Federal Register</I> on March 17, 1995 (60 FR 14594), OMB stated an intent to seek modifications to the Single Audit Act of 1984 (1984 Act) and, upon passage, extend the provisions of Circular A-133 to include audits of States and
local governments and then rescind Circular A-128. (Indian tribal governments are included under the definition of States and are covered under the 1984 Act, Circular A-128, the 1996 Amendments, and this proposed revision.) The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 was coordinated with
the 1996 Amendments such that only minimum changes are now necessary to include States and local governments under Circular A-133. When States and local governments are covered under Circular A-133, OMB will rescind Circular A-128.
</P>

<P>
Interested parties may wish to refer to the March 17, 1995, and April 30, 1996, <I>Federal Register</I> (61 FR 19134) for a more detailed discussion of the changes made during the recent revisions to Circular A-133.
</P>

<P>
<B>DATES:</B> All comments on this proposal should be in writing, and must be received by [60 days after publication]. Late comments will be considered to the extent practicable.
</P>

<P>
<B>ADDRESSES:</B> Comments should be mailed to Office of Management and Budget, Office of Federal Financial Management, Financial Standards and Reporting Branch, Room 6025, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Where possible, comments should reference applicable paragraph or section
numbers in the proposed revision. When comments are sent in by facsimile (fax), they should be faxed to (202) 395-4915. Electronic mail comments may be submitted via Internet to CONLEY_S@A1.EOP.GOV. Please include the full body of electronic mail comments in the text of the message and not as an
attachment. Please include the name, title, organization, postal address, and E-mail address in the text of the message. 
</P>

<P>
To facilitate conversion of the comments into a computer format for analysis, it would be helpful if respondents send a copy of comments on either a 3.5 or 5.25 inch diskette in either WordPerfect 5.1, WordPerfect for Windows, or ASCII format. When a diskette cannot be provided, it would be helpful if the comments were printed in pica or an equivalent 10 characters per inch type on white paper so the document can be easily scanned into a computer format.
</P>

<P>
A copy of the current Circulars A-128 and A-133 may be obtained from the OMB fax information line, 202-395-9068, document numbers 1128 and 1133, respectively, or by writing or calling the Office of Administration, Publications Office, Room 2200, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, telephone (202) 395-7332. Also, Circular A-133 and this proposed revision are available on the OMB home page on the internet which is currently located at http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OMB/html/ombhome.html.
</P>

<P>
<B>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</B> Sheila O. Conley, Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM), Financial Standards and Reporting Branch, OMB telephone (202) 395-3993 and fax (202) 395-4915. A redlined/strikeout version showing the detailed changes between the recently revised OMB
Circular A-133 and the further proposed revision is available by written request to OFFM.
</P>

<P>
<B>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</B> Pursuant to the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (P.L. 104-156), the proposed revision requires non-Federal entities (States, local governments, and non-profit organizations) expending $300,000 or more in a year in Federal awards to have an audit, sets forth
requirements for both the performance and reporting of this audit, and provides for follow-up on audit findings. Each non-Federal entity is responsible for having its audit conducted and ensuring that subrecipients expending $300,000 or more in a year meet the audit requirements of Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133 which will be renamed "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations."
</P>

<H3>Significant Changes from Circular A-128 to Circular A-133</H3>

<P>
The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, signed by the President on July 5, 1996, called for uniform requirements for audits of all types of organizations. As a consequence, OMB proposes to co-locate requirements for States, local governments, and non-profit organizations in Circular A-133, which currently addresses only non-profit organizations. At the same time, OMB would rescind Circular A-128, "Audits of State and Local Governments," which currently specifies audit requirements for States and local governments.
</P>

<P>
The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 includes the following major changes which are not reflected in Circular A-128 issued April 12, 1985:
</P>

<P>
(1) increased the threshold that triggers an audit requirement under the Circular from $25,000 to $300,000 (&#167;___.200(a));
</P>

<P>
(2) prescribed a risk-based approach to determine major programs (&#167;___.520); 
</P>

<P>
(3) required a minimum major program coverage of 50 percent (25 percent for low-risk auditees) of Federal awards expended (&#167;___.520(f));
</P>

<P>
(4) clarified the required level of internal control testing (&#167;___.500(c));
</P>

<P>
(5) provided minimum reporting requirements for the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards (&#167;___.310(b));
</P>

<P>
(6) required auditees to prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings (&#167;___.315) and a data collection form (&#167;___.320(b));
</P>

<P>
(7) required auditors to report audit findings and questioned costs in a single schedule, including a summary of the auditor's results (&#167;___.505(a)(4));
</P>

<P>
(8) prescribed criteria for reporting audit findings and questioned costs (&#167;___.510);
</P>

<P>
(9) modified the method of determining the cognizant agency for audit (&#167;___.400(a));
</P>

<P>
(10) after a two-year transition period, precluded the same auditor from preparing the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan when indirect costs exceeded $1 million in the prior year (&#167;___.305(b));
</P>

<P>
(11) after a two-year transition period, shortened the due date for submitting reports from 13 months to nine months (&#167;___.320(a));
</P>

<P>
(12) streamlined the report submission process and expanded the role of the Federal clearinghouse (&#167;___.320);
</P>

<P>
(13) changed the basis for determining the amount of Federal awards administered by the non-Federal entity from receipts to expenditures (&#167;___.200);
</P>

<P>
(14) provided guidance for conducting program-specific audits (&#167;___.235); and,
</P>

<P>
(15) reorganized the Circular into a "common rule" format to facilitate codification by Federal agencies and improve the presentation of information included in the Circular.
</P>

<H3>Significant Proposed Revisions to Circular A-133</H3>

<P>
The most significant difference between this proposed revision and the recently revised Circular A-133 is the inclusion of States and local governments. This proposed revision also includes changes relating to the effective date (31 U.S.C. 7507), the provisions permitting biennial audits in limited circumstances (31 U.S.C. 7502(b)(2) and (3)), and the allowability of audit costs (31 U.S.C. 7505(b)(1)(A)(ii)) to conform the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 to the 1996 Amendments. Aside from these changes, the 1996 Amendments do not require other substantive changes to Circular A-133.
</P>

<P>
The following discussion is provided to describe the changes needed to conform this proposed revision with the 1996 Amendments, solicit input from interested parties, and summarize some of the other changes included in this proposed revision. The readers' attention is directed to section D. Proposed
Requirement for the Auditor to Prepare and Sign the Data Collection Form Required by Circular A-133, because it is particularly important to OMB that commenters provide views on the matters discussed in this section.
</P>

<P>
<B>A. Effective Dates</B>
</P>

<P>
The 1996 Amendments apply to any non-Federal entity with respect to any of its fiscal years which begin after June 30, 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7507). Changes are proposed in paragraph 10 of the Circular, "Effective Dates," to reflect the effective dates mandated in the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
Inquirers asked which circular applies for biennial audits when the biennial period includes time before and after the effective date of the proposed revision. The 1996 Amendments do not specifically address the effective dates for biennial audits. OMB interprets the 1996 Amendments to be effective for any biennial periods which begin after June 30, 1996. As with annual audits, the prior circulars are in effect until this proposed revision is effective. Therefore, a non-Federal entity which elects a biennial audit and has a biennial period beginning on or before June 30, 1996, should apply the provisions of Circular A-128 issued April 12, 1985 (for a State or local government) or Circular A-133 issued March 8, 1990 (for a non-profit organization), as applicable. The requirements of this proposed revision apply to any biennial periods beginning after June 30, 1996.
</P>

<P>
Circular A-133 shortened the report due date from 13 months to nine months after the end of the audit period (&#167;___.320(a)). However, the 1996 Amendments (31 U.S.C. 7502(h)) provide for a transition period of at least two years during which the report due date would remain at 13 months. The proposed revision at &#167;___.320(a) incorporates this transition period such that the due date of nine months after the end of the audit period is not effective until audits of fiscal years beginning after June 30, 1998. Cognizant or oversight agencies may still provide extensions.
</P>

<P>
Paragraphs 6 and 10 of the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 instructed Federal agencies to adopt the standards set forth in the Circular in codified regulations not later than November 30, 1996. As a result of the 1996 Amendments, the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133, which applies
only to non-profit organizations, will not become operable unless this proposed revision is not finalized by June 30, 1997 (i.e., OMB expects that Circular A-133 issued March 8, 1990, will apply to non-profit organizations and Circular A-128 issued April 12, 1985, will apply to States and local governments prior to the effective dates of the 1996 Amendments, and this proposed revision will apply to these types of organizations when the 1996 Amendments become effective). Therefore, Federal agencies may forgo the requirement under the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 to adopt the standards set forth in the Circular in codified regulations not later than November 30, 1996. However, the 1996 Amendments (31 U.S.C. 7505(a)) require each Federal agency to promulgate such revisions to its regulations as may be necessary to conform such regulations to the requirements of the 1996 Amendments and OMB implementing guidance. Accordingly, the proposed revision includes a provision in paragraphs 6 and 10 of the Circular whereby Federal agencies shall adopt the standards set forth in the Circular in codified regulations not later than six months after publication of the final revision in the <I>Federal Register</I>.
</P>

<P>
<B>B. Biennial Audits in Limited Circumstances</B>
</P>

<P>
Changes are proposed at &#167;___.220 to permit biennial audits in limited circumstances in accordance with the 1996 Amendments. The provisions in the 1996 Amendments which allow non-Federal entities to elect a biennial audit are very specific (31 U.S.C. 7502(b)(2)and (3)). For a State or local government to qualify for a biennial audit election, there must be a <I>requirement</I> (as opposed to authorization) in a State's constitution or State or local law which was in effect on January 1, 1987. Also, this <I>requirement</I> must still be in effect. Only non-profit organizations that had biennial
audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, may elect a biennial audit. OMB expects that very few States, local governments, or non-profit organizations meet this criteria. Nonetheless, all auditees are encouraged to have annual audits which provide increased
accountability.
</P>

<P>
The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 includes a provision whereby a Federal agency or pass-through agency may allow a non-profit organization that elects a program-specific audit under &#167;___.200(c) to perform the audit every two years. This provision was removed from the proposed revision to conform with the biennial audit requirements specified in the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
Changes are also proposed at &#167;___.520 and &#167;___.530(a) to the major program determination process and the criteria for low-risk auditee for situations which are unique to single audits which are performed on a biennial basis.
</P>

<P>
<B>C. Audit Costs Prohibited for Subrecipients with Federal Awards Expended of Less Than $300,000 Annually</B>
</P>

<P>
The 1996 Amendments discourage pass-through entities from requiring single audits of subrecipients with total Federal awards expended of less than $300,000 annually. This is done by prohibiting charges to Federal awards for audit costs under these circumstances (31 U.S.C. 7505(b)(1)(A)(ii)).
However, pass-through entities are not prohibited from charging subrecipient monitoring costs, provided those procedures are of lesser scope than a single audit.
</P>

<P>
For example, if a pass-through entity requires a subrecipient which expends less than $300,000 annually in total Federal awards to have a single audit conducted in accordance with the 1996 Amendments, this audit must be paid for with other than Federal funds. However, the 1996 Amendments do not prohibit charging Federal awards for limited scope audits and other subrecipient monitoring procedures.
</P>

<P>
Pass-through entities would need to make appropriate changes in their agreements with subrecipients to reflect that audits will no longer be required for non-Federal entities with total Federal awards expended of less than $300,000 annually. Pass-through entities will need to review their overall subrecipient monitoring process, and decide what, if any, additional monitoring procedures may be necessary to ensure subrecipient compliance. Monitoring procedures, which include limited scope audits, can be more targeted and less costly than a full Circular A-133 audit. Subrecipient
monitoring procedures include: on-site visits, reviews of documentation supporting requests for reimbursement, limited scope audits of specific compliance areas (e.g., eligibility determinations made by subrecipients), and financial statement audits in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards. A pass-through entity should consider the cost-effectiveness of monitoring procedures compared to the relative size and complexity of the Federal awards administered by subrecipients in determining the appropriateness of monitoring procedures.
</P>

<P>
<B>D. Proposed Requirement for the Auditor to Prepare and Sign the Data Collection Form Required by Circular A-133</B>
</P>

<P>
To streamline the distribution of audit reports and improve the governmentwide collection and analysis of single audit results, Circular A-133 provides for a machine-readable form (&#167;___.320(b)) to be prepared at the completion of each audit and submitted to the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB and pass-through entities. The data collection form will provide key information about the non-Federal entity, the Federal awards it administers, and the audit results. It will serve as the basis for developing a governmentwide database on covered Federal awards administered by non-Federal entities. The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 provides for a data collection form to be submitted to the Federal clearinghouse and each pass-through entity in lieu of sending the full single audit reporting package when there are no audit findings.
</P>

<P>
The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 requires the auditee's management to prepare the data collection form. Many auditees are concerned about the additional burden this reporting requirement would place on them. A more efficient and effective method could be to have the auditor prepare the form and sign it as preparer. OMB believes this would not significantly increase audit costs, since most of the information requested on the form will be obtained directly from the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards and the auditor's reports. Since the auditor is most knowledgeable about the audit results, OMB expects that it will be efficient for the auditor to simply prepare the form at the completion of the audit. Also, OMB believes that the incremental legal exposure faced by the auditor as a result of signing the form can be minimized by restricting its use to the Federal
clearinghouse and pass-through entities for the sole purpose of data collection and so stating on the form. Under this method, the auditee would continue to be required to provide assurance to the Federal Government and pass-through entities that the auditee engaged an auditor to conduct an
audit in accordance with the Circular, that the audit was completed, and that the information included on the form is accurate. 
</P>

<P>
OMB believes that the auditor's association with the data collection form will add value to its usefulness, reduce the need for Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities to perform unnecessary verification procedures, improve the accuracy of the governmentwide database, streamline
the single audit report submission process, and reduce burden on auditees.
</P>

<P>
Therefore, OMB is considering adding a provision that requires the auditor to prepare the data collection form and sign it. If this change is made, OMB will work with the auditing profession and other interested parties to develop any necessary revisions to the form. Respondents are encouraged to comment on this change, including: whether the auditor should prepare and sign the data collection form; what would be the estimated cost of the auditor's performing this service; whether it would be beneficial to auditees, Federal agencies, and pass-through entities; and, whether there are concerns over litigation exposure.
</P>

<P>
The name of the certification form required under &#167;___.320(b) of the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 is changed to "Data Collection Form" in the proposed revision to more appropriately characterize the nature of the information request. This name change also affects #167;___.235(c)(2), &#167;___.235(c)(3), &#167;___.320(c), &#167;___.320(e)(i), and &#167;___.320(h).
</P>

<P>
<B>E. Audit Coverage Over the Allowability of Charges to Cost Pools</B>
</P>

<P>
Changes are proposed at &#167;___.500(c), &#167;___.500(d), &#167;___.505(b), &#167;___.505(c), and &#167;___.510(a) to clarify the auditor's responsibility for testing and reporting on the allowability of costs charged to cost pools: (1) used to support an indirect cost rate, or (2) allocated through a State/local-wide central service cost allocation plan (as fully described in Appendix C of Circular A-87, "Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments," issued May 4, 1995 (60 FR 26484), and hereinafter referred to as a "cost allocation plan"). The proposed language is added to address the timing of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. Indirect cost rates are based on costs incurred in a base period and applied prospectively. Costs allocated through a cost allocation plan are based on the actual costs incurred in two previous years.
</P>

<P>
Because it would not be practical to perform such tests retroactively, the auditor is expected to perform tests of costs charged to cost pools during the period that the actual costs were incurred, rather than during the period in which the rate was applied or in which the costs were allocated.
For example, if the actual costs charged to cost pools for 1997 form the basis for the indirect cost proposal and the final negotiated indirect cost rate that will be applied in 1998 and 1999, then the auditor should test actual costs charged to cost pools during 1997 as part of the 1997 audit, since 1997 is the base year. The auditor would not be expected to test such costs as part of the 1998 and 1999 audits.
</P>

<P>
<B>F. Pilot Project Authority</B>
</P>

<P>
The 1996 Amendments (31 U.S.C. 7502(j)) authorize OMB, in consultation with the Chair and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Chair and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of the House of
Representatives, to approve pilot projects to test alternative methods of achieving the purposes of the 1996 Amendments. Such pilot projects, which would be voluntary undertakings by non-Federal entities, would provide a means of assessing new ways of testing and reporting on Federal awards.
</P>

<P>
Suggestions from auditees for pilot projects should be submitted first to Federal funding agencies. If a Federal agency concludes that a suggested pilot project has merit, the Federal agency may present the suggestion to OMB for consideration. OMB will consult with the appropriate members of the
House and Senate prior to authorizing any pilot projects under the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
<B>G. Other Changes to Comply with the 1996 Amendments</B>
</P>

<P>
The revision proposes the following other changes to comply with the 1996 Amendments and include States and local governments under Circular A-133.
</P>

<P>
(1) Retitles the Circular to include States and local governments. States and local governments were also added to paragraph 1 of the Circular. 
</P>

<P>
(2) Deletes the references to Circular A-128 from paragraph 4 of the Circular and sections &#167;___.105(x)(2) and &#167;___.400(d)(4) of the attachment.

</P>

<P>
(4) Adds definitions for the terms "Indian tribe" (&#167;___.105(p)), "local government" (&#167;___.105(t)), and "State" (&#167;___.105(gg)), which are defined terms in the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
(5) Adds definitions for the term "non-Federal entity" (&#167;___.105(w)) and replaces the term "non-profit organization" with "non-Federal entity" in paragraphs 4, 6, and 10 of the Circular and sections &#167;___.100, &#167;___.105(a), &#167;___.105(s), &#167;___.105(aa), &#167;___.105(dd), &#167;___.105(ee), &#167;___.200(d), &#167;___.205(a), and &#167;___.205(h) of the attachment.
</P>

<P>
(6) Replaces the term "non-profit organization" with "subrecipient" in &#167;___.205(i).
</P>

<P>
(7) Adds "full" as a modifier of cost in &#167;___.215(b).

</P>

<P>
(10) Adds reference to Grants Management Common Rule in &#167;___.305(a).
</P>

<P>
(11) Drops "non-profit" as a modifier to pass-through entity and subrecipients in &#167;___.400(d) and &#167;___.400(d)(4), respectively.
</P>

<P>
(12) Adds a provision to cover a series of audits in &#167;___.500(a).

audits.
</P>

<P>
(14) Drops from &#167;___.520(b)(3) the reference to insurance programs because insurance programs are not specifically cited in the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
<B>H. Other Changes</B>
</P>

<P>
The revision proposes the following detailed changes.
</P>

<P>
(1) Adds to &#167;___.235(c)(3) a requirement that one copy of the data collection form prepared in accordance with &#167;___.320(b) be submitted to each pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
(2) Adds to &#167;___.320(b) a requirement that the auditee identify the cognizant or oversight agency for audit on the data collection form.
</P>

<P>
(3) Changes the requirement in &#167;___.400(a)(4) for the cognizant agency for audit to report to other Federal agencies any direct reporting of irregularities and illegal acts.
</P>

<P>
(4) Simplifies the summary of the auditor's results in &#167;___.505 by removing the requirement for a statement concerning the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern and consolidating the reporting of audit findings which were not reportable conditions or material non-compliance.
</P>

<P>
(5) Adds to the definition of audit findings reported (&#167;___.510(a)(4)) known questioned costs greater than $10,000 for Federal programs which are not audited as major programs. Consistent with this, adds in &#167;___.520(c) a reference to this requirement.
</P>

<P>
(6) Removes from &#167;___.510(a)(6) the definition of fraud because this term is the same as in professional auditing standards.
</P>

<P>
(7) Adds in &#167;___.520(d) and &#167;___.520(e) an option to allow an auditor to minimize the risk assessment required for Type B programs under certain circumstances.
</P>

<P>
(8) Adds in &#167;___.520(e) a statement to encourage auditors to use an approach in identifying high-risk Type B program which provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major over a period of time.
</P>

<P>
<B>I. Changes for Clarity</B>
</P>

<P>
The revision proposes the following changes for clarity.
</P>

<P>
(1) Changes the title of the Circular to use the term "non-profit organizations" in lieu of the phrase "institutions of higher education and other non-profit institutions" since non-profit organization is the defined term (&#167;___.105(x)) which includes non-profit institutions of higher
education.
</P>

<P>
(2) Changes the definitions of cluster of programs (&#167;___.105(e)) and Federal programs (&#167;___.105(m)) to clarify that research and development (R&amp;D) and student financial aid (SFA) are types of clusters of programs. Based upon this change, the phrase "category of programs" was replaced with "cluster of programs" in &#167;___.105(m), &#167;___.310(b)(6), &#167;___.320(b). Moves discussion of State governments combining funding from definition of Federal programs (&#167;___.105(m)) to definition of cluster of programs (&#167;___.105(e)). Adds to &#167;___.105(e) emphasis that when a State designates a cluster of programs, the State must identify the Federal awards and advise subrecipients of the applicable compliance requirements.
</P>

<P>
(3) Replaces the reference to "Federal expenditures" with "Federal awards expended" in &#167;___.200(d), &#167;___.310(b)(2), &#167;___.310(b)(6), &#167;___.310(b)(7), &#167;___.520(b)(1), &#167;___.520(d)(2), &#167;___.520(f), &#167;___.525(d)(4), &#167;___.530(d)(3).
</P>

<P>
(4) For consistency with the format of the effective date of the Circular, changes the date format from fiscal years "ending" to fiscal years "beginning" in &#167;___.305(b).
</P>

<P>
(5) Clarifies in &#167;___.315(b) that follow-up on prior audit findings is concerned with those relative to Federal awards as opposed to those relative to the financial statements of the entity.
</P>

<P>
(6) Clarifies in &#167;___.500(a) that the entity's financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards must be for the same fiscal year.
</P>

<P>
(7) Replaces in &#167;___.500(c) the term "achieve" with "support."
</P>

<P>
(8) Clarifies in &#167;___.510(a)(2) that this reporting only relates to major programs and removes discussion relating to auditor conclusions which is included in generally accepted government auditing standards.
</P>

<P>
(9) Clarifies in &#167;___.510(a)(5) and &#167;___.510(a)(6) that the reference to the schedule of findings and questioned costs is to the part of the schedule that deals with Federal awards.
</P>

<P>
(10) Changes the term "50 percent rule" to "percentage of coverage rule" in &#167;___.520(d)(2), &#167;___.520(e)(3), &#167;___.520(f), &#167;___.520(i).
</P>

<P>
(11) Clarifies in &#167;___.530(d) that this provision applies for either of the preceding two years in which the program was classified as a Type A program.
</P>

<P>
<B>Information Collection Activity Under OMB Review</B>
</P>

<P>
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 et seq.), this notice requests comment on the following two proposed information collections contained in this proposed revision. The information collection request involves two types of entities: (1) reports from auditors to auditees concerning audit results, audit findings, and questioned costs; and, (2) reports from auditees to the Federal Government providing information about the auditees, the awards they administer, and the audit results. The proposed revision specifies what auditors are required to
report to auditees, under &#167;___.235(b)(4), for program-specific audits, and &#167;___.505, "Audit Reporting," for single audits. The proposed revision also specifies what auditees are required to report to the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB and pass-through entities, if applicable, under
&#167;___.235(c), for program-specific audits, and &#167;___.320, "Report Submission," for single audits.
</P>

<P>
The information collection requests included in this proposal would result in a decrease in overall reporting burden. Although the reporting burden per audit will increase under this proposal from 26 to 34 hours (described in the following paragraphs), fewer entities will be subject to the reporting
requirements as a result of the proposal to increase the threshold that triggers an audit requirement under the Circular from $25,000 to $300,000. Based on available information, OMB estimates that approximately 25,000 non-Federal entities would be subject to the information collection requirement included in this proposal; whereas, approximately 35,000 non-Federal entities are subject to the current requirements under Circulars A-128 and A-133. The overall reporting burden currently approximates 910,000 hours (35,000 non-Federal entities at 26 hours per audit). Under the proposal, the overall reporting burden would be approximately 850,000 hours (25,000 non-Federal entities at 34 hours per audit), or 60,000 hours less than the current reporting burden. In addition, as more fully discussed below, there is an opportunity to reduce further the overall reporting burden under the proposal from 850,000 to 800,000 hours by having auditors, rather than auditees, prepare the data collection form discussed below.
</P>

<P>
Congress intended to improve the contents of single audit reports to make them more useful by enacting the 1996 Amendments. OMB believes that the increase in reporting burden per audit is warranted because several changes included in the proposed revision would improve the usefulness and
effectiveness of single audit reporting with respect to information provided by both auditors and auditees.
</P>

<P>
OMB estimates that reporting by <I>auditors</I> currently takes approximately 10 hours on the average per audit under Circulars A-128 and A-133, and will take 14 hours under the proposal. The estimated increase of 4 hours of reporting burden per audit on <I>auditors</I> is due primarily to a provision in the 1996 Amendments (31 U.S.C. 7502(g)(2)) which requires the auditor, for the first time, to prepare a summary of audit results. In its report on the 1996 Amendments, the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight stated that "the complexity of the reports makes it difficult for the average reader to understand what has been audited and reported ... A summary of the audit results would highlight important information and thus enable users to quickly discern the overall results of an audit" (H.R. Report 104-607, page 18).
</P>

<P>
OMB estimates that reporting by <I>auditees</I> currently takes approximately 16 hours on the average per audit under Circulars A-128 and A-133, and will take 20 hours under the proposal. The estimated increase of 4 hours of reporting burden per audit on <I>auditees</I> is due primarily to a proposed
requirement whereby management would prepare two new documents to improve the usefulness of single audit reports.
</P>

<P>
The first of these reports is a summary schedule of prior audit findings which will provide the current status of previously reported audit findings until such findings are corrected. This information, which is important to Federal funding agencies and pass-through entities, is currently required under Circulars A-128 and A-133 but it is not consistently provided in single audit reports. As a result, Federal funding agencies and pass-through entities frequently request this type of information long after a finding is reported, which results in additional burden on Federal agencies, auditees, and auditors. The proposed requirements provide additional guidance to auditees on where and how to present information regarding prior audit findings. While additional time may be required up-front for certain auditees to prepare the summary schedule of prior audit findings, the reporting burden for such entities should be offset by the elimination of the inefficiencies caused by the current practice of having to retrieve and provide information after-the-fact on old audit findings. 
</P>

<P>
The second report management would be required to prepare is the "Data Collection Form" prescribed in &#167;___.320(b) of the proposed revision and discussed previously in Section D (Proposed Requirement for the Auditor to Prepare and Sign the Data Collection Form Required by Circular A-133). The data collection form will facilitate streamlining the report distribution process and improve the governmentwide collection and analysis of single audit results.
</P>

<P>
OMB believes that the overall reporting burden under the proposed revision could be further reduced by having the auditor prepare the data collection form. Specifically, OMB estimates that if <I>auditors</I>, rather than <I>auditees</I>, prepare the data collection form then the estimate of reporting burden on auditors would <I>increase</I> by two hours (that is, from 14 hours to 16 hours), and the estimate of reporting burden on auditees would <I>decrease</I> by four hours (that is, from 20 hours to 16 hours) per audit under the proposal. This would result in a <I>net</I> decrease of 2 hours per audit, or 50,000 hours in overall reporting burden (25,000 non-Federal entities at 2 hours savings per audit). As a result of having auditors, rather than auditees, prepare the data collection form, overall reporting burden could be reduced from 850,000 to 800,000 hours.
</P>

<P>
Comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed information collection is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agencies, including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the estimate of the burden of the collection of the information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden related to the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.

</P>

<H3><A NAME="subpart_b">Subpart B--Audits</A></H3>
<P>
<B>&#167;___.200 Audit requirements.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Audit required.</I> Non-Federal entities that expend $300,000 or more in a year in Federal awards shall have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this part. Guidance on determining Federal awards expended is provided in &#167;___.205.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Single audit.</I> Non-Federal entities that expend $300,000 or more in a year in Federal awards shall have a single audit conducted in accordance with &#167;___.500 except when they elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Program-specific audit election.</I> When an auditee expends Federal awards under only one Federal program (excluding R&amp;D) and the Federal program's laws, regulations, or grant agreements do not require a financial statement audit of the auditee, the auditee may elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with &#167;___.235. A program-specific audit may not be elected for R&amp;D unless all of the Federal awards expended were received from the same Federal agency, or the same Federal agency and the same pass-through entity, and that Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, approves in advance a program-specific audit.
</P>

<P>
(d) <I>Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $300,000.</I> Non-Federal entities that expend less than $300,000 a year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted in &#167;___.215(a), but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and General Accounting Office (GAO).
</P>

<P>
(e) <I>Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC).</I> Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.
</P>


<P>
<B>&#167;___.205 Basis for determining Federal awards expended.
</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Determining Federal awards expended.</I> The determination of when an award is expended should be based on when the activity related to the award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements, such as: expenditure/expense transactions associated with grants, cost-reimbursement contracts, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds passed through to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or consumption of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and, the period when insurance is in force.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Loan and loan guarantees (loans).</I> Since the Federal Government is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid, the following guidelines shall be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under loan programs, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Value of new loans made or received during the fiscal year; plus
</P>

<P>
     (2) Balance of loans from previous years for which the Federal Government imposes continuing compliance requirements; plus
</P>

<P>
     (3) Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance received.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at institutions of higher education.</I> When loans are made to students of an institution of higher education but the institution does not make the loans, then only the value of loans made during the year shall be considered Federal awards expended in that year. The balance of loans for previous years is not included as Federal awards expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.
</P>

<P>
(d) <I>Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans).</I> Loans, the proceeds of which were received and expended in prior-years, are not considered Federal awards expended under this part when the laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements pertaining to such loans impose no continuing compliance requirements other than to repay the loans.
</P>

<P>
(e) <I>Endowment funds.</I> The cumulative balance of Federal awards for endowment funds which are federally restricted are considered awards expended in each year in which the funds are still restricted.
</P>

<P>
(f) <I>Free rent.</I> Free rent received by itself is not considered a Federal award expended under this part. However, free rent received as part of an award to carry out a Federal program shall be included in determining Federal awards expended and subject to audit under this part.
</P>

<P>
(g) <I>Valuing non-cash assistance.</I> Federal non-cash assistance, such as free rent, food stamps, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property, shall be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by the Federal agency.
</P>

<P>
(h) <I>Medicare.</I> Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for providing patient care services to Medicare eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part.
</P>

<P>
(i) <I>Medicaid.</I> Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing patient care services to Medicaid eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a State requires the funds to be treated as Federal awards expended because reimbursement is on a cost-reimbursement basis.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.210 Subrecipient and vendor determinations.
</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a vendor. Federal awards expended as a recipient or a subrecipient would be subject to audit under this part. The payments received for goods or services provided as a vendor would not be considered Federal awards. The guidance in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section should be considered in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods and services.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Federal award.</I> Characteristics indicative of a Federal award received by a subrecipient are when the organization:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Determines who is eligible to receive what Federal financial assistance;
</P>

<P>
     (2) Has its performance measured against whether the objectives of the Federal program are met;
</P>

<P>
     (3) Has responsibility for programmatic decision making; 
    
</P> 
<P>
     (4) Has responsibility for adherence to applicable Federal program compliance requirements; and
</P>

<P>
     (5) Uses the Federal funds to carry out a program of the organization as compared to providing goods or services for a program of the pass-through entity.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Payment for goods and services.</I> Characteristics indicative of a payment for goods and services received by a vendor are when the organization:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Provides the goods and services within normal business operations;
</P>

<P>
     (2) Provides similar goods or services to many different purchasers;
</P>

<P>
     (3) Operates in a competitive environment;
</P>

<P>
     (4) Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the operation of the Federal program; and
</P>

<P>
     (5) Is not subject to compliance requirements of the Federal program.
</P></UL>

<P>
(d) <I>Use of judgment in making determination.</I> There may be unusual circumstances or exceptions to the listed characteristics. In making the determination of whether a subrecipient or vendor relationship exists, the substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement. It is not expected that all of the characteristics will be present and judgment should be used in determining whether an entity is a subrecipient or vendor.
</P>

<P>
(e) <I>For-profit subrecipient.</I> Since this part does not apply to for-profit subrecipients, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements, as necessary, to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients. The contract with the for-profit subrecipient should describe applicable compliance requirements and the for-profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the contract, and post-award audits.
</P>

<P>
(f) <I>Compliance responsibility for vendors.</I> In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for vendors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements. Program compliance requirements normally do not pass through to vendors. However, the auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for vendor transactions which are structured such that the vendor is responsible for program compliance or the vendor's records must be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these vendor transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit shall include determining whether these transactions are in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.215 Relation to other audit requirements.
</B></P>

<P>
(a) <I>Audit under this part in lieu of other audits.</I> An audit made in accordance with this part shall be in lieu of any financial audit required under individual Federal awards. To the extent this audit meets a Federal agency's needs, it shall rely upon and use such audits. The provisions of this part neither limit the authority of Federal agencies, including their Inspectors General, or GAO to conduct or arrange for additional audits (e.g., financial audits, performance audits, evaluations, inspections, or reviews) nor authorize any auditee to constrain Federal agencies from carrying out additional audits. Any additional audits shall be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed by other auditors.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Federal agency to pay for additional audits.</I> A Federal agency that conducts or contracts for additional audits shall, consistent with other applicable laws and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Request for a program to be audited as a major program.</I> A Federal agency may request an auditee to have a particular Federal program audited as a major program in lieu of the Federal agency conducting or arranging for the additional audits. To allow for planning, such requests should be made at least 180 days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited. The auditee, after consultation with its auditor, should promptly respond to such request by informing the Federal agency whether the program would otherwise be audited as a major program using the risk-based audit approach described in &#167;___.520 and, if not, the estimated incremental cost. The Federal agency shall then promptly confirm to the auditee whether it wants the program audited as a major program. If the program is to be audited as a major program based upon this Federal agency request, and the Federal agency agrees to pay the full incremental costs, then the auditee shall have the program audited as a major program. A pass-through entity may use the provisions of this paragraph for a subrecipient.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.220 Frequency of audits.</B>
</P>

<P>
Except for the provisions for biennial audits provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, audits required by this part shall be performed annually. Any biennial audit shall cover both years within the biennial period.
</P>

<P>
(a) A State or local government that is required by constitution or statute, in effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo its audits less frequently than annually, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially. This requirement must still be in effect for the biennial period
under audit.
</P>

<P>
(b) Any non-profit organization that had biennial audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.225 Sanctions.</B>
</P>

<P>
No audit costs may be charged to Federal awards when audits required by this part have not been made or have been made but not in accordance with this part. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, Federal agencies and pass-through entities shall take appropriate action using sanctions such as:
</P>

<P>
(a) Withholding a percentage of Federal awards until the audit is completed satisfactorily;
</P>

<P>
(b) Withholding or disallowing overhead costs;
</P>

<P>
(c) Suspending Federal awards until the audit is conducted; or
</P>

<P>
(d) Terminating the Federal award.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.230 Audit costs.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Allowable costs.</I> Unless prohibited by law, the cost of audits made in accordance with the provisions of this part are allowable charges to Federal awards. The charges may be considered a direct cost or an allocated indirect cost, as determined in accordance with the provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR parts
30 and 31), or other applicable cost principles or regulations.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Unallowable costs.</I> A non-Federal entity shall not charge the following to a Federal award:
</P>

<UL>
<P>

</P>

<P>
          (iv) Follow up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee, and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding in accordance with the requirements of &#167;___.500(e).

<UL>
<P>
     (1) The audit shall be completed and the reporting required by paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section submitted within nine months after the end of the audit period, unless a longer period is agreed to in advance by the Federal agency that provided the funding or a different period is specified in a program-specific audit guide. (However, for fiscal years beginning on or before June 30, 1998, auditees shall have 13 months after the end of the audit period to complete the audit and submit the reporting package unless a different period is specified in a program-specific audit guide.) This required reporting shall be submitted within 30 days after the issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee. Unless restricted by law or regulation, the auditee shall make report copies available for public inspection.

</B></P>


<P>
The auditee shall:
</P>

<P>
(a) Identify, in its accounts, all Federal awards received and expended and the Federal programs under which they were received. Federal program and award identification shall include, as applicable, the CFDA title and number, award number and year, name of the Federal agency, and name of the pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
(b) Maintain internal control over Federal programs that provides reasonable assurance that the auditee is managing Federal awards in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements that could have a material effect on each of its Federal programs.
</P>

<P>
(c) Comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements related to each of its Federal programs.
</P>

<P>
(d) Prepare appropriate financial statements, including the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards in accordance with &#167;___.310.
</P>

<P>
(e) Ensure that the audits required by this part are properly performed and submitted when due. When extensions to the report submission due date required by &#167;___.320(a) are granted by the cognizant or oversight agency for audit, promptly notify the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB and each pass-through entity providing Federal awards of the extension.
</P>

<P>
(f) Follow up and take corrective action on audit findings, including preparation of a summary schedule of prior audit findings and a corrective action plan in accordance with &#167;___.315(b) and &#167;___.315(c), respectively.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.305 Auditor selection.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Auditor procurement.</I> In arranging for audit services, auditees shall follow the procurement standards prescribed by the Grants Management Common Rule (GMCR) published March 11, 1988 (53 FR 8034) and amended April 19, 1995 (60 FR 19638), Circular A-110, "Uniform Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations," or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. Whenever possible, auditees shall make positive efforts to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, in procuring audit services as stated in GMCR, OMB Circular A-110, or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. In requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit should be made clear. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the
responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of external quality control reviews, and price.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Restriction on auditor preparing indirect cost proposals.</I> An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan may not also be selected to perform the audit required by this part when the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceeded $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used in the preparation of the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs. To minimize any disruption in existing contracts for audit services, this paragraph applies to audits of fiscal years beginning after June 30, 1998.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Use of Federal auditors.</I> Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this part if they comply fully with the requirements of this part.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.310 Financial statements.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Financial statements.</I> The auditee shall prepare financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements shall be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year that is
chosen to meet the requirements of this part.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards.</I> The auditee shall also prepare a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the period covered by the auditee's financial statements. While not required, it is appropriate for the auditee to provide information requested to make the schedule easier to use by Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities. For example,when a Federal program has multiple award years, the auditee may list the amount of each award year separately. At a minimum, the schedule shall:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) List individual Federal programs by Federal agency and major subdivision within a Federal agency. For Federal awards received as a subrecipient, the name of the pass-through entity and identifying number assigned by the pass-through entity shall be included.
</P>

<P>
     (2) Provide total Federal awards expended for each individual Federal program and the CFDA number or other identifying number when the CFDA information is not available.
</P>

<P>
     (3) Identify major programs.
</P>

<P>
     (4) Include notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule and identify in the notes the dollar threshold used to distinguish between Type A and Type B programs, as described in &#167;___.520(b).
</P>

<P>
     (5) To the extent practical, pass-through entities should identify in the schedule the total amount provided to subrecipients from each Type A program and from each Type B program which is audited as a major program.
</P>

<P>
     (6) List individual Federal awards within a cluster of programs. However, when it is not practical to list each individual Federal award for R&amp;D, total Federal awards expended shall be shown by Federal agency and major subdivision within the Federal agency. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision in the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>

<P>
     (7) Include, in either the schedule or a note to the schedule, the value of the Federal awards expended in the form of non-cash assistance, insurance in effect during the year, and loans or loan guarantees outstanding at year end.

<B>&#167;___.315 Audit findings follow-up.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee shall prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee shall also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan shall include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under &#167;___.510(c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it shall include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Summary schedule of prior audit findings.</I> The summary schedule of prior audit findings shall report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs relative to Federal awards. The summary schedule shall also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.
</P>

<P>
     (2) When audit findings were not corrected or were only partially corrected, the summary schedule shall describe the planned corrective action as well as any partial corrective action taken.
</P>

<P>
     (3) When corrective action taken is significantly different from corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or in the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule shall provide an explanation.
</P>

<P>
     (4) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position shall be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to the Federal clearinghouse;
</P>

<P>
          (ii) The Federal agency or pass-through entity is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and
</P>

<P>
          (iii) A management decision was not issued.
</P></UL></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Corrective action plan.</I> At the completion of the audit, the auditee shall prepare a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the current year auditor's reports. The corrective action plan shall provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for
corrective action, the corrective action planned, and the anticipated completion date. If the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, then the corrective action plan shall include an explanation and specific reasons.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.320 Report submission.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The audit shall be completed and the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section submitted within nine months after the end of the audit period, unless a longer period is agreed to in advance by the cognizant or oversight agency for audit. (However, for fiscal years beginning on or before June 30, 1998, auditees shall have 13 months after the end of the audit period to complete the audit and submit the reporting package.) The reporting package shall be submitted within 30 days after issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee. Unless restricted by law or regulation, the auditee shall make copies available for public inspection.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Data Collection.</I> The auditee shall complete a data collection form which states whether the audit was completed in accordance with this part and provides information about the auditee, its Federal programs, and the results of the audit. The form shall be approved by OMB, available from the
Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB, include data elements similar to those presented in this paragraph, and use a machine-readable format. The auditee's chief executive officer or chief financial officer shall sign a statement that the information on the form is accurate and complete as
follows:
</P>

<P>
<B><CENTER>Certificate of Audit</CENTER></B>

(a) <I>Cognizant agency for audit responsibilities.</I> Recipients expending more than $25 million a year in Federal awards shall have a cognizant agency for audit. The designated cognizant agency for audit shall be the Federal awarding agency that provides the predominant amount of direct funding to a recipient unless OMB makes a specific cognizant agency for audit assignment and provides notice in the <I>Federal Register</I>. To provide for continuity of cognizance, the determination of the predominant amount of direct funding shall be based upon direct Federal awards expended in the recipient's fiscal years ending in 1995, 2000, 2005, and every fifth year thereafter. For example, audit cognizance for periods ending in 1996 through 2000 will be determined based on Federal awards expended in 1995.

When advised of deficiencies, the auditee shall work with the auditor to take corrective action. If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency for audit shall notify the auditor, the auditee, and applicable Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities of the facts and make recommendations for follow-up action. Major inadequacies or repetitive substandard performance by auditors shall be referred to appropriate State licensing agencies and professional bodies for disciplinary action.

<P>
(d) <I>Pass-through entity responsibilities.</I> A pass-through entity shall perform the following for the Federal awards it makes:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Identify Federal awards made by informing each subrecipient of CFDA title and number, award name and number, award year, if the award is R&amp;D, and name of Federal agency. When some of this information is not available, the pass-through entity shall provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.
</P>

<P>
     (2) Advise subrecipients of requirements imposed on them by Federal laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements as well as any supplemental requirements imposed by the pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.405 Management decision.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The management decision shall clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments, or take other action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request that the documentation be audited, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Federal agency.</I> As provided in &#167;___.400(a)(7), the cognizant agency for audit shall be responsible for coordinating a management decision for audit findings that affect the programs of more than one Federal agency. As provided in &#167;___.400(c)(4), a Federal awarding agency is responsible for issuing a management decision for findings that relate to Federal awards it makes to recipients. Alternate arrangements may be made on a case-by-case basis by agreement among the Federal agencies concerned.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Pass-through entity.</I> As provided in &#167;___.400(d)(5), the pass-through entity shall be responsible for making the management decision for audit findings that relate to Federal awards it makes to subrecipients.
</P>

<P>
(d) <I>Time requirements.</I> The entity responsible for making the management decision shall do so within six months of receipt of the audit report. Corrective action should be initiated within six months and proceed as rapidly as possible.

<P>
<B>&#167;___.500 Scope of audit.
</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The audit shall be conducted in accordance with GAGAS. The audit shall cover the entire operations of the auditee; or, at the option of the auditee, such audit shall include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units which expended or otherwise administered Federal awards during such fiscal year, provided that each such audit shall encompass the financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for each such department, agency, and organizational unit, which shall be considered to be a non-Federal entity. The financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards shall be for the same fiscal year.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Financial statements.</I> The auditor shall determine whether the financial statements of the auditee are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The auditor shall also determine whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements taken as a whole.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Internal control.</I>
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor shall perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over Federal programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk for major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a State/local-wide central service cost allocation plan (as fully described in Appendix C of Circular A-87, "Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments," issued May 4, 1995 (60 FR 26484), and hereinafter referred to as a "cost allocation plan").
</P>

<P>
     (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the auditor shall:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) Plan the testing of internal control over major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan to support a low assessed level of control risk for the assertions relevant to the compliance requirements for each major program; and
</P>

<P>
          (ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
</P></UL>

<P>
     (3) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements for a major program and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor shall report a reportable condition or a material weakness in accordance with &#167;___.510, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.
</P></UL>

<P>
(d) <I>Compliance.</I>
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor shall determine whether the auditee has complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements that may have a direct and material effect on each of its major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan.
</P>

<P>
     (2) The principal compliance requirements common to most Federal programs and the programmatic compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplements.
</P>

<P>
     (3) For the compliance requirements (common and programmatic) related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplements, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplements, the auditor shall determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplements, the auditor should use the types of compliance requirements (e.g., cash management, Federal financial reporting, allowable costs/cost principles, types of services allowed or unallowed, eligibility, and matching) contained in the compliance supplements as guidance for identifying the types of compliance requirements to test, and determine the requirements governing the Federal program by reviewing the provisions of contracts and grant agreements and the laws and regulations referred to in such contracts and grant agreements. The auditor should consult with the applicable Federal agency to determine the availability of agency-prepared supplements or audit guides.
</P>

<P>
     (4) The compliance testing shall include tests of transactions, including costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan, and such other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor sufficient evidence to support an opinion on compliance.
</P></UL>

<P>
(e) <I>Audit follow-up.</I> The auditor shall follow-up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with &#167;___.315(b), and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding. The auditor shall perform audit follow-up procedures regardless of whether a prior audit finding relates to a major program or the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan in the current year.
</P>

<P>
(f) <I>Communication.</I> The auditor shall communicate, preferably in writing, to the auditee which Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities are required to receive a copy of the reporting package pursuant to &#167;___.320(d)(2) and &#167;___.320(e)(2), respectively. The auditor shall retain a record of this communication in the auditor's working papers.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.505 Audit reporting.
</B></P>

<P>
The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) shall state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:
</P>

<P>
(a) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.
</P>

<P>
(b) A report on internal control related to the financial statements, major programs, and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. This report shall describe the scope of testing of internal control and the results of the tests, and, where applicable, refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>

<P>
(c) A report on compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements. This report shall also include an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements which could have a direct and material effect on each major program and on the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan, and, where applicable, refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>

<P>
(d) A schedule of findings and questioned costs which shall include the following three components:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) A summary of the auditor's results which shall include: 
    
</P> 
<UL>
<P>
          (i) The type of report the auditor issued on the financial statements of the auditee (i.e., unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);
</P>

<P>
          (ii) Where applicable, a statement that reportable conditions in internal control were disclosed by the audit of the financial tatements and whether any such conditions were material weaknesses;
</P>

<P>
          (iii) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any noncompliance which is material to the financial statements of the auditee;
</P>

<P>
          (iv) Where applicable, a statement that reportable conditions in internal control over major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan were disclosed by the audit and whether any such conditions were material weaknesses;
</P>

<P>
          (v) The type of report the auditor issued on compliance for major programs and with the provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the FAR (48 CFR parts 30 and 31), or other applicable cost principles or regulations pertaining to the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan (i.e., unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion); and
</P>

<P>
          (vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any audit findings which the auditor is required to report under &#167;___.510(a).
</P></UL>

<P>
     (2) Findings and questioned costs for the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.
</P>

<P>
     (3) Findings and questioned costs for Federal awards which shall include audit findings as defined in &#167;___.510(a).
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) Audit findings (e.g., internal control findings, compliance findings, questioned costs, or fraud) which relate to the same issue should be presented as a single audit finding. Where practical, audit findings should be organized by Federal agency or pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
          (ii) Audit findings which relate to both the financial statements and Federal awards, as reported under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, respectively, should be reported in both schedules. However, the reporting in one schedule may be in summary form with a reference to a detailed reporting in the other schedule.
</P></UL></UL>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.510 Audit findings.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Audit findings reported.</I> The auditor shall report the following as audit findings in a schedule of findings and questioned costs:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Reportable conditions in internal control over major programs and over the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a  reportable condition for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program, total costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan, or an audit objective identified in the compliance supplements. The auditor shall identify reportable conditions which are individually or cumulatively material weaknesses.
</P>

<P>
     (2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements related to a major program and the provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the FAR, or other applicable cost principles or regulations pertaining to the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. The auditor's determination of whether a noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program, total costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan, or an audit objective identified in the compliance supplements.
</P>

<P>
     (3) Known questioned costs which are greater than $10,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program and costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. Known questioned costs are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the best estimate of total costs questioned (likely questioned costs), not just the questioned costs specifically identified (known questioned costs). The auditor shall also report known questioned costs when likely questioned costs are greater than $10,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program and costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. In reporting questioned costs, the auditor shall include information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.
</P>

<P>
     (4) Known questioned costs which are greater than $10,000 for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required under this part to perform audit procedures for such a Federal program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program which is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program (e.g., as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $10,000, then the auditor shall report this as an audit finding.
</P>

<P>
     (5) The circumstances concerning why the auditor's report on compliance for major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan is other than an unqualified opinion, unless such circumstances are otherwise reported as audit findings in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards.
</P>

<P>
     (6) Known fraud affecting a Federal award, unless such fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards. This paragraph does not require the auditor to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside of the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.
</P>

<P>
     (7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with &#167;___.315(b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.
</P></UL>

<P>
(b) <I>Audit finding detail.</I> Audit findings shall be presented in sufficient detail for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action and for Federal agencies and pass-through entities to arrive at a management decision. The following specific information shall be included, as applicable, in audit findings:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Federal program and specific Federal award identification including the CFDA title and number, Federal award number and year, name of Federal agency, and name of the applicable pass-through entity. When information, such as the CFDA title and number or Federal award number, is not available, the auditor shall provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.
</P>

<P>
     (2) The criteria or specific requirement upon which the audit finding is based, including statutory, regulatory, or other citation.
</P>

<P>
     (3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.
</P>

<P>
     (4) Identification of questioned costs and how they were computed.
</P>

<P>
     (5) Information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the audit findings, such as whether the audit findings represent an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified shall be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value.
</P>

<P>
     (6) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action.
</P>

<P>
     (7) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.
</P>

<P>
     (8) Views of responsible officials of the auditee when there is disagreement with the audit findings, to the extent practical.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Reference numbers.</I> Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs shall include a reference number to allow for easy referencing of the audit findings during follow-up.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.515 Audit working papers.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Retention of working papers.</I> The auditor shall retain working papers and reports for a minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee, unless the auditor is notified in writing by the cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, or pass-through entity to extend the retention period. When the auditor is aware that the Federal awarding agency, pass-through entity, or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor shall contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to destruction of the working papers and reports.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Access to working papers.</I> Audit working papers shall be made available upon request to the cognizant or oversight agency for audit or its designee, a Federal agency providing direct or indirect funding, or GAO at the completion of the audit. Access to working papers includes the right of Federal agencies to obtain copies of working papers, as is reasonable and necessary.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.520 Major program determination.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The auditor shall use a risk-based approach to determine which Federal programs are major programs. This risk-based approach shall include consideration of: Current and prior audit experience, oversight by Federal agencies and pass-through entities, and the inherent risk of the Federal program. The process in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section shall be followed.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Step 1.</I>
</P>

<UL><P>
     (1) The auditor shall identify the larger Federal programs, which shall be labeled Type A programs. Type A programs are defined as Federal programs with Federal awards expended during the audit period exceeding the larger of:
</P> 

<UL>
<P>
          (i) $300,000 or three percent (.03) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards expended equal or exceed $300,000 but are less than or equal to $100 million.
</P>

<P>
          (ii) $3 million or three-tenths of one percent (.003) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards expended exceed $100 million but are less than or equal to $10 billion.
</P>

<P>
          (iii) $30 million or 15 hundredths of one percent (.0015) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards expended exceed $10 billion.
</P></UL>

<P>
     (2) Federal programs not labeled Type A under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be labeled Type B programs.
</P>

<P>
     (3) The inclusion of large loan and loan guarantees (loans) should not result in the exclusion of other programs as Type A programs. When a Federal program providing loans significantly affects the number or size of Type A programs, the auditor shall consider this Federal program as a Type A program and exclude its values in determining other Type A programs.
</P>

<P>
     (4) For biennial audits permitted under &#167;___.220, the determination of Type A and Type B programs shall be based upon the Federal awards expended during the two-year period.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Step 2.</I>
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) The auditor shall identify Type A programs which are low-risk. For a Type A program to be considered low-risk, it shall have been audited as a major program in at least one of the two most recent audit periods (in the most recent audit period in the case of a biennial audit), and, in the most recent audit period, it shall have had no audit findings under &#167;___.510(a). However, the auditor may use judgment and consider that audit findings from questioned costs under &#167;___.510(a)(3) and &#167;___.510(a)(4), fraud under &#167;___.510(a)(6), and audit follow-up for the summary schedule of prior audit findings under &#167;___.510(a)(7) do not preclude the Type A program from being low-risk. The auditor shall consider: the criteria in &#167;___.525(c), &#167;___.525(d)(1), &#167;___.525(d)(2), and &#167;___.525(d)(3); the results of audit follow-up; whether any changes in personnel or systems affecting a Type A program have significantly increased risk; and apply professional judgment in determining whether a Type A program is low-risk.
</P>

<P>
     (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, OMB may approve a Federal awarding agency's request that a Type A program at certain recipients may not be considered low-risk. For example, it may be necessary for a large Type A program to be audited as major each year at particular recipients to allow the Federal agency to comply with the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (31 U.S.C. 3515). The Federal agency shall notify the recipient and, if known, the auditor at least 120 days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited of OMB's approval.
</P></UL>

<P>
(d) <I>Step 3.</I>
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) The auditor shall identify Type B programs which are high-risk using professional judgment and the criteria in &#167;___.525. However, should the auditor select Option 2 under Step 4 (paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section), the auditor is not required to identify more high-risk Type B programs than the number of low-risk Type A programs. Except for known reportable conditions in internal control or compliance problems as discussed in &#167;___.525(b)(1), &#167;___.525(b)(2), and &#167;___.525(c)(1), a single criteria in &#167;___.525 would seldom cause a Type B program to be considered high-risk.
</P>

<P>
     (2) An audit under this part is not expected to test relatively small Federal programs. Therefore, except to meet the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section, the auditor is only required to perform risk assessments on Type B programs that exceed the larger of:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) $100,000 or three-tenths of one percent (.003) of total Federal awards expended when the auditee has less than or equal to $100 million in total Federal awards expended.
</P>

<P>
          (ii) $300,000 or three-hundredths of one percent (.0003) of total Federal awards expended when the auditee has more than $100 million in total Federal awards expended.
</P></UL></UL>

<P>
(e) <I>Step 4.</I> At a minimum, the auditor shall audit all of the following as major programs:
</P>

<UL><P>
     (1) All Type A programs, except the auditor may exclude any Type A programs identified as low-risk under Step 2 (paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
</P>

<P>
          (2) (i) High-risk Type B programs as identified under either of the following two options:
</P>

<UL><UL><P>
               (A) <I>Option 1</I>. At least one half of the Type B programs identified as high-risk under Step 3 (paragraph (d) of this section), except this paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) does not require the auditor to audit more high-risk Type B programs than the number of low-risk Type A programs identified as low-risk under Step 2.
</P>

<P>
               (B) <I>Option 2</I>. One high-risk Type B program for each Type A program identified as low-risk under Step 2.
</P></UL>

<P>
          (ii) When identifying which high-risk Type B programs to audit as major under either Option 1 or 2 in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) or (B), the auditor is encouraged to use an approach which provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major over a period of time.
</P></UL>

<P>
     (3) Such additional programs as may be necessary to comply with the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. This paragraph (e)(3) may require the auditor to audit more programs as major than the number of Type A programs.
</P></UL>

<P>
(f) <I>Percentage of coverage rule.</I> The auditor shall audit as major programs Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, encompass at least 50 percent of total Federal awards expended. If the auditee meets the criteria in &#167;___.530 for a low-risk auditee, the auditor need only audit as major programs Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, encompass at least 25 percent of total Federal awards expended.
</P>

<P>
(g) <I>Documentation of risk.</I> The auditor shall document in the working papers the risk analysis process used in determining major programs.
</P>

<P>
(h) <I>Auditor's judgment.</I> When the major program determination was performed and documented in accordance with this part, the auditor's judgment in applying the risk-based approach to determine major programs shall be presumed correct. Challenges by Federal agencies and pass-through entities shall only be for clearly improper use of the guidance in this part. However, Federal agencies and pass-through entities may provide auditors guidance about the risk of a particular Federal program and the auditor shall consider this guidance in determining major programs in audits not yet completed.
</P>

<P>
(i) <I>Deviation from use of risk criteria.</I> For first-year audits, the auditor may elect to determine major programs as all Type A programs plus any Type B programs as necessary to meet the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. Under this option, the auditor would not be required to perform the procedures discussed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) A first-year audit is the first year the entity is audited under this part or the first year of a change of auditors.
</P>

<P>
     (2) To ensure that a frequent change of auditors would not preclude audit of high-risk Type B programs, this election for first-year audits may not be used by an auditee more than once in every three years.
</P></UL>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.525 Criteria for Federal program risk.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of noncompliance occurring which could be material to the Federal program. The auditor shall use auditor judgment and consider criteria, such as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular Federal program with auditee management and the Federal agency or pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Current and prior audit experience.</I> (1) Weaknesses in internal control over Federal programs would indicate higher risk. Consideration should be given to the control environment over Federal programs and such factors as the expectation of management's adherence to applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of contracts and grant agreements and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the Federal programs.
</P>

<UL><UL>
<P>
          (i) A Federal program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. When assessing risk in a large single audit, the auditor shall consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit (e.g., one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.
</P>

<P>
          (ii) When significant parts of a Federal program are passed through to subrecipients, a weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk.
</P>

<P>
          (iii) The extent to which computer processing is used to administer Federal programs, as well as the complexity of that processing, should be considered by the auditor in assessing risk. New and recently modified computer systems may also indicate risk.
</P></UL>

<P>
     (2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, particularly when the situations identified in the audit findings could have a significant impact on a Federal program or have not been corrected.
</P>

<P>
     (3) Federal programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than Federal programs recently audited as major programs without audit findings.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Oversight exercised by Federal agencies and pass-through entities.</I> (1) Oversight exercised by Federal agencies or pass-through entities could indicate risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity which disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk. However, monitoring which disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (2) Federal agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, may identify Federal programs which are higher risk. OMB plans to provide this identification in the compliance supplements.
</P></UL>

<P>
(d) <I>Inherent risk of the Federal program.</I> (1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be of higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may have a high-risk for time and effort reporting, but otherwise be at low-risk.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (2) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, laws, regulations, or the provisions of contracts or grant agreements may increase risk.
</P>

<P>
     (3) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.
</P>

<P>
     (4) Type B programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.
</P></UL>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.530 Criteria for a low-risk auditee.</B>
</P>

<P>
An auditee which meets all of the following conditions for each of the preceding two years shall qualify as a low-risk auditee and be eligible for reduced audit coverage in accordance with &#167;___.520(f):
</P>

<P>
(a) Single audits were performed on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of this part. A non-Federal entity that has biennial audits does not qualify as a low-risk auditee.
</P>

<P>
(b) The auditor's opinions on the financial statements and the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards were unqualified. However, the cognizant or oversight agency for audit may judge that an opinion qualification does not affect the management of Federal awards and provide a waiver.
</P>

<P>
(c) There were no deficiencies in internal control which were identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of GAGAS. However, the cognizant or oversight agency for audit may judge that any identified material weaknesses do not affect the management of Federal awards and provide a waiver.
</P>

<P>
(d) None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two years in which they were classified as Type A programs:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Internal control deficiencies which were identified as material weaknesses;
</P>

<P>
     (2) Noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements which have a material effect on the Type A program; or
</P>

<P>
     (3) Known or likely questioned costs that exceed five percent of the total Federal awards expended for a Type A program during the year.
</P></UL>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>OMB Circular A-133, <I>Audits of Institutions of Higher Education
and Other Non-Profit Institutions</I></H3>

<P>
OMB has proposed revisions to Circular A-133 that would bring state and local governments under the circular, permit biennial audits in certain circumstances and address the allowability of audit costs for subrecipients. The proposal was published in the Nov. 5, 1996, <i>Federal Register</i>, and comments are due to OMB by Jan. 6, 1997. OMB plans to rescind Circular A-128, <i>Audits of State and
Local Governments</i>, when the proposal is finalized. These changes would fully implement the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (P.L. 104-156), which applies to audits of fiscal years ending after June 30, 1996. Many of the new statutory requirements had already been incorporated into Circular A-133 when OMB revised it in April 1996. The <i>Federal Grants Management Handbook</i> provides complete analyses of OMB circulars and proposals related to grants management. <A HREF="/tpg/fed_gts/gran/gran_a133.html">Click here to retrieve the proposal.</A></P>

<P>
<B>ACTION:</B> Proposed Revision of OMB Circular No. A-133 and Proposed Rescission
of OMB Circular No. A-128
</P>

<HR>
<P>
<B>SUMMARY:</B> This Notice offers interested parties an opportunity to comment on further proposed revisions to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-133, "Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Institutions," and the proposed consolidation of OMB Circular No. A-128, "Audits of State and Local Governments," into Circular No. A-133 (with Circular A-128 being rescinded). This Notice also requests comment on two proposed information collections contained in the proposed revision to Circular A-133. These actions are being proposed to implement the Single
Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (1996 Amendments), which were signed into law on July 5, 1996 (P.L. 104-156).
</P>

<P>
In the proposed revisions to Circular A-133, as published in the <I>Federal Register</I> on March 17, 1995 (60 FR 14594), OMB stated an intent to seek modifications to the Single Audit Act of 1984 (1984 Act) and, upon passage, extend the provisions of Circular A-133 to include audits of States and
local governments and then rescind Circular A-128. (Indian tribal governments are included under the definition of States and are covered under the 1984 Act, Circular A-128, the 1996 Amendments, and this proposed revision.) The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 was coordinated with
the 1996 Amendments such that only minimum changes are now necessary to include States and local governments under Circular A-133. When States and local governments are covered under Circular A-133, OMB will rescind Circular A-128.
</P>

<P>
Interested parties may wish to refer to the March 17, 1995, and April 30, 1996, <I>Federal Register</I> (61 FR 19134) for a more detailed discussion of the changes made during the recent revisions to Circular A-133.
</P>

<P>
<B>DATES:</B> All comments on this proposal should be in writing, and must be received by [60 days after publication]. Late comments will be considered to the extent practicable.
</P>

<P>
<B>ADDRESSES:</B> Comments should be mailed to Office of Management and Budget, Office of Federal Financial Management, Financial Standards and Reporting Branch, Room 6025, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Where possible, comments should reference applicable paragraph or section
numbers in the proposed revision. When comments are sent in by facsimile (fax), they should be faxed to (202) 395-4915. Electronic mail comments may be submitted via Internet to CONLEY_S@A1.EOP.GOV. Please include the full body of electronic mail comments in the text of the message and not as an
attachment. Please include the name, title, organization, postal address, and E-mail address in the text of the message. 
</P>

<P>
To facilitate conversion of the comments into a computer format for analysis, it would be helpful if respondents send a copy of comments on either a 3.5 or 5.25 inch diskette in either WordPerfect 5.1, WordPerfect for Windows, or ASCII format. When a diskette cannot be provided, it would be helpful if the comments were printed in pica or an equivalent 10 characters per inch type on white paper so the document can be easily scanned into a computer format.
</P>

<P>
A copy of the current Circulars A-128 and A-133 may be obtained from the OMB fax information line, 202-395-9068, document numbers 1128 and 1133, respectively, or by writing or calling the Office of Administration, Publications Office, Room 2200, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, telephone (202) 395-7332. Also, Circular A-133 and this proposed revision are available on the OMB home page on the internet which is currently located at http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OMB/html/ombhome.html.
</P>

<P>
<B>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</B> Sheila O. Conley, Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM), Financial Standards and Reporting Branch, OMB telephone (202) 395-3993 and fax (202) 395-4915. A redlined/strikeout version showing the detailed changes between the recently revised OMB
Circular A-133 and the further proposed revision is available by written request to OFFM.
</P>

<P>
<B>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</B> Pursuant to the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (P.L. 104-156), the proposed revision requires non-Federal entities (States, local governments, and non-profit organizations) expending $300,000 or more in a year in Federal awards to have an audit, sets forth
requirements for both the performance and reporting of this audit, and provides for follow-up on audit findings. Each non-Federal entity is responsible for having its audit conducted and ensuring that subrecipients expending $300,000 or more in a year meet the audit requirements of Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133 which will be renamed "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations."
</P>

<H3>Significant Changes from Circular A-128 to Circular A-133</H3>

<P>
The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, signed by the President on July 5, 1996, called for uniform requirements for audits of all types of organizations. As a consequence, OMB proposes to co-locate requirements for States, local governments, and non-profit organizations in Circular A-133, which currently addresses only non-profit organizations. At the same time, OMB would rescind Circular A-128, "Audits of State and Local Governments," which currently specifies audit requirements for States and local governments.
</P>

<P>
The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 includes the following major changes which are not reflected in Circular A-128 issued April 12, 1985:
</P>

<P>
(1) increased the threshold that triggers an audit requirement under the Circular from $25,000 to $300,000 (&#167;___.200(a));
</P>

<P>
(2) prescribed a risk-based approach to determine major programs (&#167;___.520); 
</P>

<P>
(3) required a minimum major program coverage of 50 percent (25 percent for low-risk auditees) of Federal awards expended (&#167;___.520(f));
</P>

<P>
(4) clarified the required level of internal control testing (&#167;___.500(c));
</P>

<P>
(5) provided minimum reporting requirements for the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards (&#167;___.310(b));
</P>

<P>
(6) required auditees to prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings (&#167;___.315) and a data collection form (&#167;___.320(b));
</P>

<P>
(7) required auditors to report audit findings and questioned costs in a single schedule, including a summary of the auditor's results (&#167;___.505(a)(4));
</P>

<P>
(8) prescribed criteria for reporting audit findings and questioned costs (&#167;___.510);
</P>

<P>
(9) modified the method of determining the cognizant agency for audit (&#167;___.400(a));
</P>

<P>
(10) after a two-year transition period, precluded the same auditor from preparing the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan when indirect costs exceeded $1 million in the prior year (&#167;___.305(b));
</P>

<P>
(11) after a two-year transition period, shortened the due date for submitting reports from 13 months to nine months (&#167;___.320(a));
</P>

<P>
(12) streamlined the report submission process and expanded the role of the Federal clearinghouse (&#167;___.320);
</P>

<P>
(13) changed the basis for determining the amount of Federal awards administered by the non-Federal entity from receipts to expenditures (&#167;___.200);
</P>

<P>
(14) provided guidance for conducting program-specific audits (&#167;___.235); and,
</P>

<P>
(15) reorganized the Circular into a "common rule" format to facilitate codification by Federal agencies and improve the presentation of information included in the Circular.
</P>

<H3>Significant Proposed Revisions to Circular A-133</H3>

<P>
The most significant difference between this proposed revision and the recently revised Circular A-133 is the inclusion of States and local governments. This proposed revision also includes changes relating to the effective date (31 U.S.C. 7507), the provisions permitting biennial audits in limited circumstances (31 U.S.C. 7502(b)(2) and (3)), and the allowability of audit costs (31 U.S.C. 7505(b)(1)(A)(ii)) to conform the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 to the 1996 Amendments. Aside from these changes, the 1996 Amendments do not require other substantive changes to Circular A-133.
</P>

<P>
The following discussion is provided to describe the changes needed to conform this proposed revision with the 1996 Amendments, solicit input from interested parties, and summarize some of the other changes included in this proposed revision. The readers' attention is directed to section D. Proposed
Requirement for the Auditor to Prepare and Sign the Data Collection Form Required by Circular A-133, because it is particularly important to OMB that commenters provide views on the matters discussed in this section.
</P>

<P>
<B>A. Effective Dates</B>
</P>

<P>
The 1996 Amendments apply to any non-Federal entity with respect to any of its fiscal years which begin after June 30, 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7507). Changes are proposed in paragraph 10 of the Circular, "Effective Dates," to reflect the effective dates mandated in the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
Inquirers asked which circular applies for biennial audits when the biennial period includes time before and after the effective date of the proposed revision. The 1996 Amendments do not specifically address the effective dates for biennial audits. OMB interprets the 1996 Amendments to be effective for any biennial periods which begin after June 30, 1996. As with annual audits, the prior circulars are in effect until this proposed revision is effective. Therefore, a non-Federal entity which elects a biennial audit and has a biennial period beginning on or before June 30, 1996, should apply the provisions of Circular A-128 issued April 12, 1985 (for a State or local government) or Circular A-133 issued March 8, 1990 (for a non-profit organization), as applicable. The requirements of this proposed revision apply to any biennial periods beginning after June 30, 1996.
</P>

<P>
Circular A-133 shortened the report due date from 13 months to nine months after the end of the audit period (&#167;___.320(a)). However, the 1996 Amendments (31 U.S.C. 7502(h)) provide for a transition period of at least two years during which the report due date would remain at 13 months. The proposed revision at &#167;___.320(a) incorporates this transition period such that the due date of nine months after the end of the audit period is not effective until audits of fiscal years beginning after June 30, 1998. Cognizant or oversight agencies may still provide extensions.
</P>

<P>
Paragraphs 6 and 10 of the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 instructed Federal agencies to adopt the standards set forth in the Circular in codified regulations not later than November 30, 1996. As a result of the 1996 Amendments, the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133, which applies
only to non-profit organizations, will not become operable unless this proposed revision is not finalized by June 30, 1997 (i.e., OMB expects that Circular A-133 issued March 8, 1990, will apply to non-profit organizations and Circular A-128 issued April 12, 1985, will apply to States and local governments prior to the effective dates of the 1996 Amendments, and this proposed revision will apply to these types of organizations when the 1996 Amendments become effective). Therefore, Federal agencies may forgo the requirement under the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 to adopt the standards set forth in the Circular in codified regulations not later than November 30, 1996. However, the 1996 Amendments (31 U.S.C. 7505(a)) require each Federal agency to promulgate such revisions to its regulations as may be necessary to conform such regulations to the requirements of the 1996 Amendments and OMB implementing guidance. Accordingly, the proposed revision includes a provision in paragraphs 6 and 10 of the Circular whereby Federal agencies shall adopt the standards set forth in the Circular in codified regulations not later than six months after publication of the final revision in the <I>Federal Register</I>.
</P>

<P>
<B>B. Biennial Audits in Limited Circumstances</B>
</P>

<P>
Changes are proposed at &#167;___.220 to permit biennial audits in limited circumstances in accordance with the 1996 Amendments. The provisions in the 1996 Amendments which allow non-Federal entities to elect a biennial audit are very specific (31 U.S.C. 7502(b)(2)and (3)). For a State or local government to qualify for a biennial audit election, there must be a <I>requirement</I> (as opposed to authorization) in a State's constitution or State or local law which was in effect on January 1, 1987. Also, this <I>requirement</I> must still be in effect. Only non-profit organizations that had biennial
audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, may elect a biennial audit. OMB expects that very few States, local governments, or non-profit organizations meet this criteria. Nonetheless, all auditees are encouraged to have annual audits which provide increased
accountability.
</P>

<P>
The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 includes a provision whereby a Federal agency or pass-through agency may allow a non-profit organization that elects a program-specific audit under &#167;___.200(c) to perform the audit every two years. This provision was removed from the proposed revision to conform with the biennial audit requirements specified in the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
Changes are also proposed at &#167;___.520 and &#167;___.530(a) to the major program determination process and the criteria for low-risk auditee for situations which are unique to single audits which are performed on a biennial basis.
</P>

<P>
<B>C. Audit Costs Prohibited for Subrecipients with Federal Awards Expended of Less Than $300,000 Annually</B>
</P>

<P>
The 1996 Amendments discourage pass-through entities from requiring single audits of subrecipients with total Federal awards expended of less than $300,000 annually. This is done by prohibiting charges to Federal awards for audit costs under these circumstances (31 U.S.C. 7505(b)(1)(A)(ii)).
However, pass-through entities are not prohibited from charging subrecipient monitoring costs, provided those procedures are of lesser scope than a single audit.
</P>

<P>
For example, if a pass-through entity requires a subrecipient which expends less than $300,000 annually in total Federal awards to have a single audit conducted in accordance with the 1996 Amendments, this audit must be paid for with other than Federal funds. However, the 1996 Amendments do not prohibit charging Federal awards for limited scope audits and other subrecipient monitoring procedures.
</P>

<P>
Pass-through entities would need to make appropriate changes in their agreements with subrecipients to reflect that audits will no longer be required for non-Federal entities with total Federal awards expended of less than $300,000 annually. Pass-through entities will need to review their overall subrecipient monitoring process, and decide what, if any, additional monitoring procedures may be necessary to ensure subrecipient compliance. Monitoring procedures, which include limited scope audits, can be more targeted and less costly than a full Circular A-133 audit. Subrecipient
monitoring procedures include: on-site visits, reviews of documentation supporting requests for reimbursement, limited scope audits of specific compliance areas (e.g., eligibility determinations made by subrecipients), and financial statement audits in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards. A pass-through entity should consider the cost-effectiveness of monitoring procedures compared to the relative size and complexity of the Federal awards administered by subrecipients in determining the appropriateness of monitoring procedures.
</P>

<P>
<B>D. Proposed Requirement for the Auditor to Prepare and Sign the Data Collection Form Required by Circular A-133</B>
</P>

<P>
To streamline the distribution of audit reports and improve the governmentwide collection and analysis of single audit results, Circular A-133 provides for a machine-readable form (&#167;___.320(b)) to be prepared at the completion of each audit and submitted to the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB and pass-through entities. The data collection form will provide key information about the non-Federal entity, the Federal awards it administers, and the audit results. It will serve as the basis for developing a governmentwide database on covered Federal awards administered by non-Federal entities. The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 provides for a data collection form to be submitted to the Federal clearinghouse and each pass-through entity in lieu of sending the full single audit reporting package when there are no audit findings.
</P>

<P>
The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 requires the auditee's management to prepare the data collection form. Many auditees are concerned about the additional burden this reporting requirement would place on them. A more efficient and effective method could be to have the auditor prepare the form and sign it as preparer. OMB believes this would not significantly increase audit costs, since most of the information requested on the form will be obtained directly from the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards and the auditor's reports. Since the auditor is most knowledgeable about the audit results, OMB expects that it will be efficient for the auditor to simply prepare the form at the completion of the audit. Also, OMB believes that the incremental legal exposure faced by the auditor as a result of signing the form can be minimized by restricting its use to the Federal
clearinghouse and pass-through entities for the sole purpose of data collection and so stating on the form. Under this method, the auditee would continue to be required to provide assurance to the Federal Government and pass-through entities that the auditee engaged an auditor to conduct an
audit in accordance with the Circular, that the audit was completed, and that the information included on the form is accurate. 
</P>

<P>
OMB believes that the auditor's association with the data collection form will add value to its usefulness, reduce the need for Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities to perform unnecessary verification procedures, improve the accuracy of the governmentwide database, streamline
the single audit report submission process, and reduce burden on auditees.
</P>

<P>
Therefore, OMB is considering adding a provision that requires the auditor to prepare the data collection form and sign it. If this change is made, OMB will work with the auditing profession and other interested parties to develop any necessary revisions to the form. Respondents are encouraged to comment on this change, including: whether the auditor should prepare and sign the data collection form; what would be the estimated cost of the auditor's performing this service; whether it would be beneficial to auditees, Federal agencies, and pass-through entities; and, whether there are concerns over litigation exposure.
</P>

<P>
The name of the certification form required under &#167;___.320(b) of the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 is changed to "Data Collection Form" in the proposed revision to more appropriately characterize the nature of the information request. This name change also affects #167;___.235(c)(2), &#167;___.235(c)(3), &#167;___.320(c), &#167;___.320(e)(i), and &#167;___.320(h).
</P>

<P>
<B>E. Audit Coverage Over the Allowability of Charges to Cost Pools</B>
</P>

<P>
Changes are proposed at &#167;___.500(c), &#167;___.500(d), &#167;___.505(b), &#167;___.505(c), and &#167;___.510(a) to clarify the auditor's responsibility for testing and reporting on the allowability of costs charged to cost pools: (1) used to support an indirect cost rate, or (2) allocated through a State/local-wide central service cost allocation plan (as fully described in Appendix C of Circular A-87, "Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments," issued May 4, 1995 (60 FR 26484), and hereinafter referred to as a "cost allocation plan"). The proposed language is added to address the timing of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. Indirect cost rates are based on costs incurred in a base period and applied prospectively. Costs allocated through a cost allocation plan are based on the actual costs incurred in two previous years.
</P>

<P>
Because it would not be practical to perform such tests retroactively, the auditor is expected to perform tests of costs charged to cost pools during the period that the actual costs were incurred, rather than during the period in which the rate was applied or in which the costs were allocated.
For example, if the actual costs charged to cost pools for 1997 form the basis for the indirect cost proposal and the final negotiated indirect cost rate that will be applied in 1998 and 1999, then the auditor should test actual costs charged to cost pools during 1997 as part of the 1997 audit, since 1997 is the base year. The auditor would not be expected to test such costs as part of the 1998 and 1999 audits.
</P>

<P>
<B>F. Pilot Project Authority</B>
</P>

<P>
The 1996 Amendments (31 U.S.C. 7502(j)) authorize OMB, in consultation with the Chair and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Chair and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of the House of
Representatives, to approve pilot projects to test alternative methods of achieving the purposes of the 1996 Amendments. Such pilot projects, which would be voluntary undertakings by non-Federal entities, would provide a means of assessing new ways of testing and reporting on Federal awards.
</P>

<P>
Suggestions from auditees for pilot projects should be submitted first to Federal funding agencies. If a Federal agency concludes that a suggested pilot project has merit, the Federal agency may present the suggestion to OMB for consideration. OMB will consult with the appropriate members of the
House and Senate prior to authorizing any pilot projects under the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
<B>G. Other Changes to Comply with the 1996 Amendments</B>
</P>

<P>
The revision proposes the following other changes to comply with the 1996 Amendments and include States and local governments under Circular A-133.
</P>

<P>
(1) Retitles the Circular to include States and local governments. States and local governments were also added to paragraph 1 of the Circular. 
</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
(4) Adds definitions for the terms "Indian tribe" (&#167;___.105(p)), "local government" (&#167;___.105(t)), and "State" (&#167;___.105(gg)), which are defined terms in the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
(5) Adds definitions for the term "non-Federal entity" (&#167;___.105(w)) and replaces the term "non-profit organization" with "non-Federal entity" in paragraphs 4, 6, and 10 of the Circular and sections &#167;___.100, &#167;___.105(a), &#167;___.105(s), &#167;___.105(aa), &#167;___.105(dd), &#167;___.105(ee), &#167;___.200(d), &#167;___.205(a), and &#167;___.205(h) of the attachment.
</P>

<P>
(6) Replaces the term "non-profit organization" with "subrecipient" in &#167;___.205(i).
</P>

<P>
(7) Adds "full" as a modifier of cost in &#167;___.215(b).

</P>

<P>
(9) Changes title of "central clearinghouse" to "Federal clearinghouse" in &#167;___.235(c)(2), &#167;___.235(c)(3), &#167;___.300(e), &#167;___.315(b)(4)(i), &#167;___.320(b), &#167;___.320(d), &#167;___.320(g), &#167;___.320(h), &#167;___.320(i), and &#167;___.320(j).
</P>

<P>
(10) Adds reference to Grants Management Common Rule in &#167;___.305(a).
</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
(12) Adds a provision to cover a series of audits in &#167;___.500(a).

audits.
</P>

<P>
(14) Drops from &#167;___.520(b)(3) the reference to insurance programs because insurance programs are not specifically cited in the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
<B>H. Other Changes</B>
</P>

<P>
The revision proposes the following detailed changes.
</P>

<P>
(1) Adds to &#167;___.235(c)(3) a requirement that one copy of the data collection form prepared in accordance with &#167;___.320(b) be submitted to each pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
(2) Adds to &#167;___.320(b) a requirement that the auditee identify the cognizant or oversight agency for audit on the data collection form.
</P>

<P>
(3) Changes the requirement in &#167;___.400(a)(4) for the cognizant agency for audit to report to other Federal agencies any direct reporting of irregularities and illegal acts.
</P>

<P>
(4) Simplifies the summary of the auditor's results in &#167;___.505 by removing the requirement for a statement concerning the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern and consolidating the reporting of audit findings which were not reportable conditions or material non-compliance.
</P>

<P>
(5) Adds to the definition of audit findings reported (&#167;___.510(a)(4)) known questioned costs greater than $10,000 for Federal programs which are not audited as major programs. Consistent with this, adds in &#167;___.520(c) a reference to this requirement.
</P>

<P>
(6) Removes from &#167;___.510(a)(6) the definition of fraud because this term is the same as in professional auditing standards.
</P>

<P>
(7) Adds in &#167;___.520(d) and &#167;___.520(e) an option to allow an auditor to minimize the risk assessment required for Type B programs under certain circumstances.
</P>

<P>
(8) Adds in &#167;___.520(e) a statement to encourage auditors to use an approach in identifying high-risk Type B program which provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major over a period of time.
</P>

<P>
<B>I. Changes for Clarity</B>
</P>

<P>
The revision proposes the following changes for clarity.
</P>

<P>
(1) Changes the title of the Circular to use the term "non-profit organizations" in lieu of the phrase "institutions of higher education and other non-profit institutions" since non-profit organization is the defined term (&#167;___.105(x)) which includes non-profit institutions of higher
education.
</P>

<P>
(2) Changes the definitions of cluster of programs (&#167;___.105(e)) and Federal programs (&#167;___.105(m)) to clarify that research and development (R&amp;D) and student financial aid (SFA) are types of clusters of programs. Based upon this change, the phrase "category of programs" was replaced with "cluster of programs" in &#167;___.105(m), &#167;___.310(b)(6), &#167;___.320(b). Moves discussion of State governments combining funding from definition of Federal programs (&#167;___.105(m)) to definition of cluster of programs (&#167;___.105(e)). Adds to &#167;___.105(e) emphasis that when a State designates a cluster of programs, the State must identify the Federal awards and advise subrecipients of the applicable compliance requirements.
</P>

<P>
(3) Replaces the reference to "Federal expenditures" with "Federal awards expended" in &#167;___.200(d), &#167;___.310(b)(2), &#167;___.310(b)(6), &#167;___.310(b)(7), &#167;___.520(b)(1), &#167;___.520(d)(2), &#167;___.520(f), &#167;___.525(d)(4), &#167;___.530(d)(3).
</P>

<P>
(4) For consistency with the format of the effective date of the Circular, changes the date format from fiscal years "ending" to fiscal years "beginning" in &#167;___.305(b).
</P>

<P>
(5) Clarifies in &#167;___.315(b) that follow-up on prior audit findings is concerned with those relative to Federal awards as opposed to those relative to the financial statements of the entity.
</P>

<P>
(6) Clarifies in &#167;___.500(a) that the entity's financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards must be for the same fiscal year.
</P>

<P>
(7) Replaces in &#167;___.500(c) the term "achieve" with "support."
</P>

<P>
(8) Clarifies in &#167;___.510(a)(2) that this reporting only relates to major programs and removes discussion relating to auditor conclusions which is included in generally accepted government auditing standards.
</P>

<P>
(9) Clarifies in &#167;___.510(a)(5) and &#167;___.510(a)(6) that the reference to the schedule of findings and questioned costs is to the part of the schedule that deals with Federal awards.
</P>

<P>
(10) Changes the term "50 percent rule" to "percentage of coverage rule" in &#167;___.520(d)(2), &#167;___.520(e)(3), &#167;___.520(f), &#167;___.520(i).
</P>

<P>
(11) Clarifies in &#167;___.530(d) that this provision applies for either of the preceding two years in which the program was classified as a Type A program.
</P>

<P>
<B>Information Collection Activity Under OMB Review</B>
</P>

<P>
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 et seq.), this notice requests comment on the following two proposed information collections contained in this proposed revision. The information collection request involves two types of entities: (1) reports from auditors to auditees concerning audit results, audit findings, and questioned costs; and, (2) reports from auditees to the Federal Government providing information about the auditees, the awards they administer, and the audit results. The proposed revision specifies what auditors are required to
report to auditees, under &#167;___.235(b)(4), for program-specific audits, and &#167;___.505, "Audit Reporting," for single audits. The proposed revision also specifies what auditees are required to report to the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB and pass-through entities, if applicable, under
&#167;___.235(c), for program-specific audits, and &#167;___.320, "Report Submission," for single audits.
</P>

<P>
The information collection requests included in this proposal would result in a decrease in overall reporting burden. Although the reporting burden per audit will increase under this proposal from 26 to 34 hours (described in the following paragraphs), fewer entities will be subject to the reporting
requirements as a result of the proposal to increase the threshold that triggers an audit requirement under the Circular from $25,000 to $300,000. Based on available information, OMB estimates that approximately 25,000 non-Federal entities would be subject to the information collection requirement included in this proposal; whereas, approximately 35,000 non-Federal entities are subject to the current requirements under Circulars A-128 and A-133. The overall reporting burden currently approximates 910,000 hours (35,000 non-Federal entities at 26 hours per audit). Under the proposal, the overall reporting burden would be approximately 850,000 hours (25,000 non-Federal entities at 34 hours per audit), or 60,000 hours less than the current reporting burden. In addition, as more fully discussed below, there is an opportunity to reduce further the overall reporting burden under the proposal from 850,000 to 800,000 hours by having auditors, rather than auditees, prepare the data collection form discussed below.
</P>

<P>
Congress intended to improve the contents of single audit reports to make them more useful by enacting the 1996 Amendments. OMB believes that the increase in reporting burden per audit is warranted because several changes included in the proposed revision would improve the usefulness and
effectiveness of single audit reporting with respect to information provided by both auditors and auditees.
</P>

<P>
OMB estimates that reporting by <I>auditors</I> currently takes approximately 10 hours on the average per audit under Circulars A-128 and A-133, and will take 14 hours under the proposal. The estimated increase of 4 hours of reporting burden per audit on <I>auditors</I> is due primarily to a provision in the 1996 Amendments (31 U.S.C. 7502(g)(2)) which requires the auditor, for the first time, to prepare a summary of audit results. In its report on the 1996 Amendments, the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight stated that "the complexity of the reports makes it difficult for the average reader to understand what has been audited and reported ... A summary of the audit results would highlight important information and thus enable users to quickly discern the overall results of an audit" (H.R. Report 104-607, page 18).
</P>

<P>
OMB estimates that reporting by <I>auditees</I> currently takes approximately 16 hours on the average per audit under Circulars A-128 and A-133, and will take 20 hours under the proposal. The estimated increase of 4 hours of reporting burden per audit on <I>auditees</I> is due primarily to a proposed
requirement whereby management would prepare two new documents to improve the usefulness of single audit reports.
</P>

<P>
The first of these reports is a summary schedule of prior audit findings which will provide the current status of previously reported audit findings until such findings are corrected. This information, which is important to Federal funding agencies and pass-through entities, is currently required under Circulars A-128 and A-133 but it is not consistently provided in single audit reports. As a result, Federal funding agencies and pass-through entities frequently request this type of information long after a finding is reported, which results in additional burden on Federal agencies, auditees, and auditors. The proposed requirements provide additional guidance to auditees on where and how to present information regarding prior audit findings. While additional time may be required up-front for certain auditees to prepare the summary schedule of prior audit findings, the reporting burden for such entities should be offset by the elimination of the inefficiencies caused by the current practice of having to retrieve and provide information after-the-fact on old audit findings. 
</P>

<P>
The second report management would be required to prepare is the "Data Collection Form" prescribed in &#167;___.320(b) of the proposed revision and discussed previously in Section D (Proposed Requirement for the Auditor to Prepare and Sign the Data Collection Form Required by Circular A-133). The data collection form will facilitate streamlining the report distribution process and improve the governmentwide collection and analysis of single audit results.
</P>

<P>
OMB believes that the overall reporting burden under the proposed revision could be further reduced by having the auditor prepare the data collection form. Specifically, OMB estimates that if <I>auditors</I>, rather than <I>auditees</I>, prepare the data collection form then the estimate of reporting burden on auditors would <I>increase</I> by two hours (that is, from 14 hours to 16 hours), and the estimate of reporting burden on auditees would <I>decrease</I> by four hours (that is, from 20 hours to 16 hours) per audit under the proposal. This would result in a <I>net</I> decrease of 2 hours per audit, or 50,000 hours in overall reporting burden (25,000 non-Federal entities at 2 hours savings per audit). As a result of having auditors, rather than auditees, prepare the data collection form, overall reporting burden could be reduced from 850,000 to 800,000 hours.
</P>

<P>
Comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed information collection is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agencies, including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the estimate of the burden of the collection of the information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden related to the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.

<B>&#167;___.200 Audit requirements.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Audit required.</I> Non-Federal entities that expend $300,000 or more in a year in Federal awards shall have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this part. Guidance on determining Federal awards expended is provided in &#167;___.205.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Single audit.</I> Non-Federal entities that expend $300,000 or more in a year in Federal awards shall have a single audit conducted in accordance with &#167;___.500 except when they elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Program-specific audit election.</I> When an auditee expends Federal awards under only one Federal program (excluding R&amp;D) and the Federal program's laws, regulations, or grant agreements do not require a financial statement audit of the auditee, the auditee may elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with &#167;___.235. A program-specific audit may not be elected for R&amp;D unless all of the Federal awards expended were received from the same Federal agency, or the same Federal agency and the same pass-through entity, and that Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, approves in advance a program-specific audit.
</P>

<P>
(d) <I>Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $300,000.</I> Non-Federal entities that expend less than $300,000 a year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted in &#167;___.215(a), but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and General Accounting Office (GAO).
</P>

<P>
(e) <I>Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC).</I> Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.
</P>


<P>
<B>&#167;___.205 Basis for determining Federal awards expended.
</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Determining Federal awards expended.</I> The determination of when an award is expended should be based on when the activity related to the award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements, such as: expenditure/expense transactions associated with grants, cost-reimbursement contracts, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds passed through to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or consumption of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and, the period when insurance is in force.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Loan and loan guarantees (loans).</I> Since the Federal Government is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid, the following guidelines shall be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under loan programs, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Value of new loans made or received during the fiscal year; plus
</P>

<P>
     (2) Balance of loans from previous years for which the Federal Government imposes continuing compliance requirements; plus
</P>

<P>
     (3) Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance received.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at institutions of higher education.</I> When loans are made to students of an institution of higher education but the institution does not make the loans, then only the value of loans made during the year shall be considered Federal awards expended in that year. The balance of loans for previous years is not included as Federal awards expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.
</P>

<P>
(d) <I>Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans).</I> Loans, the proceeds of which were received and expended in prior-years, are not considered Federal awards expended under this part when the laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements pertaining to such loans impose no continuing compliance requirements other than to repay the loans.
</P>

<P>
(e) <I>Endowment funds.</I> The cumulative balance of Federal awards for endowment funds which are federally restricted are considered awards expended in each year in which the funds are still restricted.
</P>

<P>
(f) <I>Free rent.</I> Free rent received by itself is not considered a Federal award expended under this part. However, free rent received as part of an award to carry out a Federal program shall be included in determining Federal awards expended and subject to audit under this part.
</P>

<P>
(g) <I>Valuing non-cash assistance.</I> Federal non-cash assistance, such as free rent, food stamps, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property, shall be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by the Federal agency.
</P>

<P>
(h) <I>Medicare.</I> Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for providing patient care services to Medicare eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part.
</P>

<P>
(i) <I>Medicaid.</I> Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing patient care services to Medicaid eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a State requires the funds to be treated as Federal awards expended because reimbursement is on a cost-reimbursement basis.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.210 Subrecipient and vendor determinations.
</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a vendor. Federal awards expended as a recipient or a subrecipient would be subject to audit under this part. The payments received for goods or services provided as a vendor would not be considered Federal awards. The guidance in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section should be considered in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods and services.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Federal award.</I> Characteristics indicative of a Federal award received by a subrecipient are when the organization:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Determines who is eligible to receive what Federal financial assistance;
</P>

<P>
     (2) Has its performance measured against whether the objectives of the Federal program are met;
</P>

<P>
     (3) Has responsibility for programmatic decision making; 
    
</P> 
<P>
     (4) Has responsibility for adherence to applicable Federal program compliance requirements; and
</P>

<P>
     (5) Uses the Federal funds to carry out a program of the organization as compared to providing goods or services for a program of the pass-through entity.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Payment for goods and services.</I> Characteristics indicative of a payment for goods and services received by a vendor are when the organization:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Provides the goods and services within normal business operations;
</P>

<P>
     (2) Provides similar goods or services to many different purchasers;
</P>

<P>
     (3) Operates in a competitive environment;
</P>

<P>
     (4) Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the operation of the Federal program; and
</P>

<P>
     (5) Is not subject to compliance requirements of the Federal program.
</P></UL>

<P>
(d) <I>Use of judgment in making determination.</I> There may be unusual circumstances or exceptions to the listed characteristics. In making the determination of whether a subrecipient or vendor relationship exists, the substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement. It is not expected that all of the characteristics will be present and judgment should be used in determining whether an entity is a subrecipient or vendor.
</P>

<P>
(e) <I>For-profit subrecipient.</I> Since this part does not apply to for-profit subrecipients, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements, as necessary, to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients. The contract with the for-profit subrecipient should describe applicable compliance requirements and the for-profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the contract, and post-award audits.
</P>

<P>
(f) <I>Compliance responsibility for vendors.</I> In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for vendors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements. Program compliance requirements normally do not pass through to vendors. However, the auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for vendor transactions which are structured such that the vendor is responsible for program compliance or the vendor's records must be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these vendor transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit shall include determining whether these transactions are in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.215 Relation to other audit requirements.
</B></P>

<P>
(a) <I>Audit under this part in lieu of other audits.</I> An audit made in accordance with this part shall be in lieu of any financial audit required under individual Federal awards. To the extent this audit meets a Federal agency's needs, it shall rely upon and use such audits. The provisions of this part neither limit the authority of Federal agencies, including their Inspectors General, or GAO to conduct or arrange for additional audits (e.g., financial audits, performance audits, evaluations, inspections, or reviews) nor authorize any auditee to constrain Federal agencies from carrying out additional audits. Any additional audits shall be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed by other auditors.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Federal agency to pay for additional audits.</I> A Federal agency that conducts or contracts for additional audits shall, consistent with other applicable laws and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Request for a program to be audited as a major program.</I> A Federal agency may request an auditee to have a particular Federal program audited as a major program in lieu of the Federal agency conducting or arranging for the additional audits. To allow for planning, such requests should be made at least 180 days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited. The auditee, after consultation with its auditor, should promptly respond to such request by informing the Federal agency whether the program would otherwise be audited as a major program using the risk-based audit approach described in &#167;___.520 and, if not, the estimated incremental cost. The Federal agency shall then promptly confirm to the auditee whether it wants the program audited as a major program. If the program is to be audited as a major program based upon this Federal agency request, and the Federal agency agrees to pay the full incremental costs, then the auditee shall have the program audited as a major program. A pass-through entity may use the provisions of this paragraph for a subrecipient.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.220 Frequency of audits.</B>
</P>

<P>
Except for the provisions for biennial audits provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, audits required by this part shall be performed annually. Any biennial audit shall cover both years within the biennial period.
</P>

<P>
(a) A State or local government that is required by constitution or statute, in effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo its audits less frequently than annually, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially. This requirement must still be in effect for the biennial period
under audit.
</P>

<P>
(b) Any non-profit organization that had biennial audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.225 Sanctions.</B>
</P>

<P>
No audit costs may be charged to Federal awards when audits required by this part have not been made or have been made but not in accordance with this part. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, Federal agencies and pass-through entities shall take appropriate action using sanctions such as:
</P>

<P>
(a) Withholding a percentage of Federal awards until the audit is completed satisfactorily;
</P>

<P>
(b) Withholding or disallowing overhead costs;
</P>

<P>
(c) Suspending Federal awards until the audit is conducted; or
</P>

<P>
(d) Terminating the Federal award.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.230 Audit costs.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Allowable costs.</I> Unless prohibited by law, the cost of audits made in accordance with the provisions of this part are allowable charges to Federal awards. The charges may be considered a direct cost or an allocated indirect cost, as determined in accordance with the provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR parts
30 and 31), or other applicable cost principles or regulations.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Unallowable costs.</I> A non-Federal entity shall not charge the following to a Federal award:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) The cost of any audit under the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501 <I>et seq</I>.) not conducted in accordance with this part.
</P>

<P>
     (2) The cost of auditing a non-Federal entity which has Federal awards expended of less than $300,000 per year and is thereby exempted under &#167;___.200(d) from having an audit conducted under this part. However, this does not prohibit a pass-through entity from charging Federal awards for the cost of limited scope audits to monitor its subrecipients in accordance with &#167;___.400(d)(3), provided the subrecipient does not have a single audit.
</P></UL>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.235 Program-specific audits.
</B>

<P>
(a) <I>Program-specific audit guide available.</I> In many cases, a program-specific audit guide will be available to provide specific guidance to the auditor with respect to internal control, compliance requirements, suggested audit procedures, and audit reporting requirements. The auditor should contact the Office of Inspector General of the Federal agency to determine whether such a guide is available.

</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Program-specific audit guide not available.</I> (1) When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor shall have basically the same responsibilities for the Federal program as they would have for an audit of a major program in a single audit.

</P>

<P>
          (iv) Follow up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee, and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding in accordance with the requirements of &#167;___.500(e).
</P></UL>

<P>
     (4) The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) shall state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:

</B></P>


<P>
The auditee shall:
</P>

<P>
(a) Identify, in its accounts, all Federal awards received and expended and the Federal programs under which they were received. Federal program and award identification shall include, as applicable, the CFDA title and number, award number and year, name of the Federal agency, and name of the pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
(b) Maintain internal control over Federal programs that provides reasonable assurance that the auditee is managing Federal awards in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements that could have a material effect on each of its Federal programs.
</P>

<P>
(c) Comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements related to each of its Federal programs.
</P>

<P>
(d) Prepare appropriate financial statements, including the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards in accordance with &#167;___.310.
</P>

<P>
(e) Ensure that the audits required by this part are properly performed and submitted when due. When extensions to the report submission due date required by &#167;___.320(a) are granted by the cognizant or oversight agency for audit, promptly notify the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB and each pass-through entity providing Federal awards of the extension.
</P>

<P>
(f) Follow up and take corrective action on audit findings, including preparation of a summary schedule of prior audit findings and a corrective action plan in accordance with &#167;___.315(b) and &#167;___.315(c), respectively.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.305 Auditor selection.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Auditor procurement.</I> In arranging for audit services, auditees shall follow the procurement standards prescribed by the Grants Management Common Rule (GMCR) published March 11, 1988 (53 FR 8034) and amended April 19, 1995 (60 FR 19638), Circular A-110, "Uniform Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations," or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. Whenever possible, auditees shall make positive efforts to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, in procuring audit services as stated in GMCR, OMB Circular A-110, or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. In requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit should be made clear. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the
responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of external quality control reviews, and price.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Restriction on auditor preparing indirect cost proposals.</I> An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan may not also be selected to perform the audit required by this part when the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceeded $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used in the preparation of the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs. To minimize any disruption in existing contracts for audit services, this paragraph applies to audits of fiscal years beginning after June 30, 1998.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Use of Federal auditors.</I> Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this part if they comply fully with the requirements of this part.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.310 Financial statements.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Financial statements.</I> The auditee shall prepare financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements shall be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year that is
chosen to meet the requirements of this part.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards.</I> The auditee shall also prepare a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the period covered by the auditee's financial statements. While not required, it is appropriate for the auditee to provide information requested to make the schedule easier to use by Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities. For example,when a Federal program has multiple award years, the auditee may list the amount of each award year separately. At a minimum, the schedule shall:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) List individual Federal programs by Federal agency and major subdivision within a Federal agency. For Federal awards received as a subrecipient, the name of the pass-through entity and identifying number assigned by the pass-through entity shall be included.
</P>

<P>
     (2) Provide total Federal awards expended for each individual Federal program and the CFDA number or other identifying number when the CFDA information is not available.
</P>

<P>
     (3) Identify major programs.
</P>

<P>
     (4) Include notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule and identify in the notes the dollar threshold used to distinguish between Type A and Type B programs, as described in &#167;___.520(b).
</P>

<P>
     (5) To the extent practical, pass-through entities should identify in the schedule the total amount provided to subrecipients from each Type A program and from each Type B program which is audited as a major program.
</P>

<P>
     (6) List individual Federal awards within a cluster of programs. However, when it is not practical to list each individual Federal award for R&amp;D, total Federal awards expended shall be shown by Federal agency and major subdivision within the Federal agency. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision in the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>

<P>
     (7) Include, in either the schedule or a note to the schedule, the value of the Federal awards expended in the form of non-cash assistance, insurance in effect during the year, and loans or loan guarantees outstanding at year end.
</P></UL>

<B>&#167;___.315 Audit findings follow-up.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee shall prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee shall also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan shall include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under &#167;___.510(c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it shall include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Summary schedule of prior audit findings.</I> The summary schedule of prior audit findings shall report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs relative to Federal awards. The summary schedule shall also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.
</P>

<P>
     (2) When audit findings were not corrected or were only partially corrected, the summary schedule shall describe the planned corrective action as well as any partial corrective action taken.
</P>

<P>
     (3) When corrective action taken is significantly different from corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or in the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule shall provide an explanation.
</P>

<P>
     (4) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position shall be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to the Federal clearinghouse;
</P>

<P>
          (ii) The Federal agency or pass-through entity is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and
</P>

<P>
          (iii) A management decision was not issued.
</P></UL></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Corrective action plan.</I> At the completion of the audit, the auditee shall prepare a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the current year auditor's reports. The corrective action plan shall provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for
corrective action, the corrective action planned, and the anticipated completion date. If the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, then the corrective action plan shall include an explanation and specific reasons.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.320 Report submission.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The audit shall be completed and the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section submitted within nine months after the end of the audit period, unless a longer period is agreed to in advance by the cognizant or oversight agency for audit. (However, for fiscal years beginning on or before June 30, 1998, auditees shall have 13 months after the end of the audit period to complete the audit and submit the reporting package.) The reporting package shall be submitted within 30 days after issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee. Unless restricted by law or regulation, the auditee shall make copies available for public inspection.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Data Collection.</I> The auditee shall complete a data collection form which states whether the audit was completed in accordance with this part and provides information about the auditee, its Federal programs, and the results of the audit. The form shall be approved by OMB, available from the
Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB, include data elements similar to those presented in this paragraph, and use a machine-readable format. The auditee's chief executive officer or chief financial officer shall sign a statement that the information on the form is accurate and complete as
follows:
</P>

<P>
<B><CENTER>Certificate of Audit</CENTER></B>
</P>

<P>
This is to certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the [specify name of the auditee] has: (1) engaged an auditor to perform an audit in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-133 for the [specify number] months ended [specify date]; (2) the auditor has completed such audit and presented a signed audit report which states that the audit was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Circular; and, (3) the information on the attached form is accurate and complete and reflects the results of this audit, as presented in the auditor's report.

     (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor shall perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over Federal programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk for major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a State/local-wide central service cost allocation plan (as fully described in Appendix C of Circular A-87, "Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments," issued May 4, 1995 (60 FR 26484), and hereinafter referred to as a "cost allocation plan").
</P>

<P>
     (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the auditor shall:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) Plan the testing of internal control over major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan to support a low assessed level of control risk for the assertions relevant to the compliance requirements for each major program; and
</P>

<P>
          (ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
</P></UL>

<P>
     (3) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements for a major program and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor shall report a reportable condition or a material weakness in accordance with &#167;___.510, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.
</P></UL>

<P>
(d) <I>Compliance.</I>
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor shall determine whether the auditee has complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements that may have a direct and material effect on each of its major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan.
</P>

<P>
     (2) The principal compliance requirements common to most Federal programs and the programmatic compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplements.
</P>

<P>
     (3) For the compliance requirements (common and programmatic) related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplements, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplements, the auditor shall determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplements, the auditor should use the types of compliance requirements (e.g., cash management, Federal financial reporting, allowable costs/cost principles, types of services allowed or unallowed, eligibility, and matching) contained in the compliance supplements as guidance for identifying the types of compliance requirements to test, and determine the requirements governing the Federal program by reviewing the provisions of contracts and grant agreements and the laws and regulations referred to in such contracts and grant agreements. The auditor should consult with the applicable Federal agency to determine the availability of agency-prepared supplements or audit guides.
</P>

<P>
     (4) The compliance testing shall include tests of transactions, including costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan, and such other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor sufficient evidence to support an opinion on compliance.
</P></UL>

<P>
(e) <I>Audit follow-up.</I> The auditor shall follow-up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with &#167;___.315(b), and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding. The auditor shall perform audit follow-up procedures regardless of whether a prior audit finding relates to a major program or the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan in the current year.
</P>

<P>
(f) <I>Communication.</I> The auditor shall communicate, preferably in writing, to the auditee which Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities are required to receive a copy of the reporting package pursuant to &#167;___.320(d)(2) and &#167;___.320(e)(2), respectively. The auditor shall retain a record of this communication in the auditor's working papers.

<P>
<B>&#167;___.505 Audit reporting.
</B></P>

<P>
The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) shall state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:
</P>

<P>
(a) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.
</P>

<P>
(b) A report on internal control related to the financial statements, major programs, and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. This report shall describe the scope of testing of internal control and the results of the tests, and, where applicable, refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>

<P>
(c) A report on compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements. This report shall also include an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements which could have a direct and material effect on each major program and on the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan, and, where applicable, refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>

<P>
(d) A schedule of findings and questioned costs which shall include the following three components:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) A summary of the auditor's results which shall include: 
    
</P> 
<UL>
<P>
          (i) The type of report the auditor issued on the financial statements of the auditee (i.e., unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);
</P>

<P>
          (ii) Where applicable, a statement that reportable conditions in internal control were disclosed by the audit of the financial tatements and whether any such conditions were material weaknesses;
</P>

<P>
          (iii) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any noncompliance which is material to the financial statements of the auditee;
</P>

<P>
          (iv) Where applicable, a statement that reportable conditions in internal control over major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan were disclosed by the audit and whether any such conditions were material weaknesses;
</P>

<P>
          (v) The type of report the auditor issued on compliance for major programs and with the provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the FAR (48 CFR parts 30 and 31), or other applicable cost principles or regulations pertaining to the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan (i.e., unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion); and
</P>

<P>
          (vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any audit findings which the auditor is required to report under &#167;___.510(a).
</P></UL>

<P>
     (2) Findings and questioned costs for the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.
</P>

<P>
     (3) Findings and questioned costs for Federal awards which shall include audit findings as defined in &#167;___.510(a).
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) Audit findings (e.g., internal control findings, compliance findings, questioned costs, or fraud) which relate to the same issue should be presented as a single audit finding. Where practical, audit findings should be organized by Federal agency or pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
          (ii) Audit findings which relate to both the financial statements and Federal awards, as reported under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, respectively, should be reported in both schedules. However, the reporting in one schedule may be in summary form with a reference to a detailed reporting in the other schedule.
</P></UL></UL>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.510 Audit findings.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Audit findings reported.</I> The auditor shall report the following as audit findings in a schedule of findings and questioned costs:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Reportable conditions in internal control over major programs and over the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a  reportable condition for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program, total costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan, or an audit objective identified in the compliance supplements. The auditor shall identify reportable conditions which are individually or cumulatively material weaknesses.
</P>

<P>
     (2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements related to a major program and the provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the FAR, or other applicable cost principles or regulations pertaining to the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. The auditor's determination of whether a noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program, total costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan, or an audit objective identified in the compliance supplements.
</P>

<P>
     (3) Known questioned costs which are greater than $10,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program and costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. Known questioned costs are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the best estimate of total costs questioned (likely questioned costs), not just the questioned costs specifically identified (known questioned costs). The auditor shall also report known questioned costs when likely questioned costs are greater than $10,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program and costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. In reporting questioned costs, the auditor shall include information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.
</P>

<P>
     (4) Known questioned costs which are greater than $10,000 for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required under this part to perform audit procedures for such a Federal program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program which is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program (e.g., as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $10,000, then the auditor shall report this as an audit finding.
</P>

<P>
     (5) The circumstances concerning why the auditor's report on compliance for major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan is other than an unqualified opinion, unless such circumstances are otherwise reported as audit findings in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards.
</P>

<P>
     (6) Known fraud affecting a Federal award, unless such fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards. This paragraph does not require the auditor to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside of the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.
</P>

<P>
     (7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with &#167;___.315(b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.
</P></UL>

<P>
(b) <I>Audit finding detail.</I> Audit findings shall be presented in sufficient detail for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action and for Federal agencies and pass-through entities to arrive at a management decision. The following specific information shall be included, as applicable, in audit findings:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Federal program and specific Federal award identification including the CFDA title and number, Federal award number and year, name of Federal agency, and name of the applicable pass-through entity. When information, such as the CFDA title and number or Federal award number, is not available, the auditor shall provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.
</P>

<P>
     (2) The criteria or specific requirement upon which the audit finding is based, including statutory, regulatory, or other citation.
</P>

<P>
     (3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.
</P>

<P>
     (4) Identification of questioned costs and how they were computed.
</P>

<P>
     (5) Information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the audit findings, such as whether the audit findings represent an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified shall be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value.
</P>

<P>
     (6) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action.
</P>

<P>
     (7) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.
</P>

<P>
     (8) Views of responsible officials of the auditee when there is disagreement with the audit findings, to the extent practical.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Reference numbers.</I> Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs shall include a reference number to allow for easy referencing of the audit findings during follow-up.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.515 Audit working papers.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Retention of working papers.</I> The auditor shall retain working papers and reports for a minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee, unless the auditor is notified in writing by the cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, or pass-through entity to extend the retention period. When the auditor is aware that the Federal awarding agency, pass-through entity, or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor shall contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to destruction of the working papers and reports.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Access to working papers.</I> Audit working papers shall be made available upon request to the cognizant or oversight agency for audit or its designee, a Federal agency providing direct or indirect funding, or GAO at the completion of the audit. Access to working papers includes the right of Federal agencies to obtain copies of working papers, as is reasonable and necessary.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.520 Major program determination.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The auditor shall use a risk-based approach to determine which Federal programs are major programs. This risk-based approach shall include consideration of: Current and prior audit experience, oversight by Federal agencies and pass-through entities, and the inherent risk of the Federal program. The process in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section shall be followed.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Step 1.</I>
</P>

<UL><P>
     (1) The auditor shall identify the larger Federal programs, which shall be labeled Type A programs. Type A programs are defined as Federal programs with Federal awards expended during the audit period exceeding the larger of:
</P> 

<UL>
<P>
          (i) $300,000 or three percent (.03) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards expended equal or exceed $300,000 but are less than or equal to $100 million.
</P>

<P>
          (ii) $3 million or three-tenths of one percent (.003) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards expended exceed $100 million but are less than or equal to $10 billion.
</P>

<P>
          (iii) $30 million or 15 hundredths of one percent (.0015) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards expended exceed $10 billion.
</P></UL>

<P>
     (2) Federal programs not labeled Type A under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be labeled Type B programs.
</P>

<P>
     (3) The inclusion of large loan and loan guarantees (loans) should not result in the exclusion of other programs as Type A programs. When a Federal program providing loans significantly affects the number or size of Type A programs, the auditor shall consider this Federal program as a Type A program and exclude its values in determining other Type A programs.
</P>

<P>
     (4) For biennial audits permitted under &#167;___.220, the determination of Type A and Type B programs shall be based upon the Federal awards expended during the two-year period.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Step 2.</I>
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) The auditor shall identify Type A programs which are low-risk. For a Type A program to be considered low-risk, it shall have been audited as a major program in at least one of the two most recent audit periods (in the most recent audit period in the case of a biennial audit), and, in the most recent audit period, it shall have had no audit findings under &#167;___.510(a). However, the auditor may use judgment and consider that audit findings from questioned costs under &#167;___.510(a)(3) and &#167;___.510(a)(4), fraud under &#167;___.510(a)(6), and audit follow-up for the summary schedule of prior audit findings under &#167;___.510(a)(7) do not preclude the Type A program from being low-risk. The auditor shall consider: the criteria in &#167;___.525(c), &#167;___.525(d)(1), &#167;___.525(d)(2), and &#167;___.525(d)(3); the results of audit follow-up; whether any changes in personnel or systems affecting a Type A program have significantly increased risk; and apply professional judgment in determining whether a Type A program is low-risk.
</P>

<P>
     (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, OMB may approve a Federal awarding agency's request that a Type A program at certain recipients may not be considered low-risk. For example, it may be necessary for a large Type A program to be audited as major each year at particular recipients to allow the Federal agency to comply with the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (31 U.S.C. 3515). The Federal agency shall notify the recipient and, if known, the auditor at least 120 days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited of OMB's approval.
</P></UL>

<P>
(d) <I>Step 3.</I>
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) The auditor shall identify Type B programs which are high-risk using professional judgment and the criteria in &#167;___.525. However, should the auditor select Option 2 under Step 4 (paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section), the auditor is not required to identify more high-risk Type B programs than the number of low-risk Type A programs. Except for known reportable conditions in internal control or compliance problems as discussed in &#167;___.525(b)(1), &#167;___.525(b)(2), and &#167;___.525(c)(1), a single criteria in &#167;___.525 would seldom cause a Type B program to be considered high-risk.
</P>

<P>
     (2) An audit under this part is not expected to test relatively small Federal programs. Therefore, except to meet the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section, the auditor is only required to perform risk assessments on Type B programs that exceed the larger of:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) $100,000 or three-tenths of one percent (.003) of total Federal awards expended when the auditee has less than or equal to $100 million in total Federal awards expended.
</P>

<P>
          (ii) $300,000 or three-hundredths of one percent (.0003) of total Federal awards expended when the auditee has more than $100 million in total Federal awards expended.
</P></UL></UL>

<P>
(e) <I>Step 4.</I> At a minimum, the auditor shall audit all of the following as major programs:
</P>

<UL><P>
     (1) All Type A programs, except the auditor may exclude any Type A programs identified as low-risk under Step 2 (paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
</P>

<P>
          (2) (i) High-risk Type B programs as identified under either of the following two options:
</P>

<UL><UL><P>
               (A) <I>Option 1</I>. At least one half of the Type B programs identified as high-risk under Step 3 (paragraph (d) of this section), except this paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) does not require the auditor to audit more high-risk Type B programs than the number of low-risk Type A programs identified as low-risk under Step 2.
</P>

<P>
               (B) <I>Option 2</I>. One high-risk Type B program for each Type A program identified as low-risk under Step 2.
</P></UL>

<P>
          (ii) When identifying which high-risk Type B programs to audit as major under either Option 1 or 2 in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) or (B), the auditor is encouraged to use an approach which provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major over a period of time.
</P></UL>

<P>
     (3) Such additional programs as may be necessary to comply with the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. This paragraph (e)(3) may require the auditor to audit more programs as major than the number of Type A programs.
</P></UL>

<P>
(f) <I>Percentage of coverage rule.</I> The auditor shall audit as major programs Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, encompass at least 50 percent of total Federal awards expended. If the auditee meets the criteria in &#167;___.530 for a low-risk auditee, the auditor need only audit as major programs Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, encompass at least 25 percent of total Federal awards expended.
</P>

<P>
(g) <I>Documentation of risk.</I> The auditor shall document in the working papers the risk analysis process used in determining major programs.
</P>

<P>
(h) <I>Auditor's judgment.</I> When the major program determination was performed and documented in accordance with this part, the auditor's judgment in applying the risk-based approach to determine major programs shall be presumed correct. Challenges by Federal agencies and pass-through entities shall only be for clearly improper use of the guidance in this part. However, Federal agencies and pass-through entities may provide auditors guidance about the risk of a particular Federal program and the auditor shall consider this guidance in determining major programs in audits not yet completed.
</P>

<P>
(i) <I>Deviation from use of risk criteria.</I> For first-year audits, the auditor may elect to determine major programs as all Type A programs plus any Type B programs as necessary to meet the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. Under this option, the auditor would not be required to perform the procedures discussed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) A first-year audit is the first year the entity is audited under this part or the first year of a change of auditors.
</P>

<P>
     (2) To ensure that a frequent change of auditors would not preclude audit of high-risk Type B programs, this election for first-year audits may not be used by an auditee more than once in every three years.
</P></UL>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.525 Criteria for Federal program risk.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of noncompliance occurring which could be material to the Federal program. The auditor shall use auditor judgment and consider criteria, such as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular Federal program with auditee management and the Federal agency or pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Current and prior audit experience.</I> (1) Weaknesses in internal control over Federal programs would indicate higher risk. Consideration should be given to the control environment over Federal programs and such factors as the expectation of management's adherence to applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of contracts and grant agreements and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the Federal programs.
</P>

<UL><UL>
<P>
          (i) A Federal program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. When assessing risk in a large single audit, the auditor shall consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit (e.g., one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.
</P>

<P>
          (ii) When significant parts of a Federal program are passed through to subrecipients, a weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk.
</P>

<P>
          (iii) The extent to which computer processing is used to administer Federal programs, as well as the complexity of that processing, should be considered by the auditor in assessing risk. New and recently modified computer systems may also indicate risk.
</P></UL>

<P>
     (2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, particularly when the situations identified in the audit findings could have a significant impact on a Federal program or have not been corrected.
</P>

<P>
     (3) Federal programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than Federal programs recently audited as major programs without audit findings.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Oversight exercised by Federal agencies and pass-through entities.</I> (1) Oversight exercised by Federal agencies or pass-through entities could indicate risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity which disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk. However, monitoring which disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (2) Federal agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, may identify Federal programs which are higher risk. OMB plans to provide this identification in the compliance supplements.
</P></UL>

<P>
(d) <I>Inherent risk of the Federal program.</I> (1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be of higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may have a high-risk for time and effort reporting, but otherwise be at low-risk.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (2) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, laws, regulations, or the provisions of contracts or grant agreements may increase risk.
</P>

<P>
     (3) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.
</P>

<P>
     (4) Type B programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.
</P></UL>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.530 Criteria for a low-risk auditee.</B>
</P>

<P>
An auditee which meets all of the following conditions for each of the preceding two years shall qualify as a low-risk auditee and be eligible for reduced audit coverage in accordance with &#167;___.520(f):
</P>

<P>
(a) Single audits were performed on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of this part. A non-Federal entity that has biennial audits does not qualify as a low-risk auditee.
</P>

<P>
(b) The auditor's opinions on the financial statements and the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards were unqualified. However, the cognizant or oversight agency for audit may judge that an opinion qualification does not affect the management of Federal awards and provide a waiver.
</P>

<P>
(c) There were no deficiencies in internal control which were identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of GAGAS. However, the cognizant or oversight agency for audit may judge that any identified material weaknesses do not affect the management of Federal awards and provide a waiver.
</P>

<P>
(d) None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two years in which they were classified as Type A programs:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Internal control deficiencies which were identified as material weaknesses;
</P>

<P>
     (2) Noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements which have a material effect on the Type A program; or

<Title> OUST, ASTM To Develop Standard for Tiered Third-party UST Inspection Program</Title>
</head>

<body background="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">
<IMG SRC = "/tpg/enviro/ustt/ustthead.gif" alt="Underground Storage Tank Guide"><P>

<h2> OUST, ASTM To Develop Standard for Tiered Third-party UST Inspection Program</h2><P>

As part of its private sector initiative, the U.S. Environmental Protection

Agency's (EPA) Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST) is working with the

American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) to develop a standard for a

third-party inspection program in which private inspectors would grant

underground storage tank (UST) owners certificates documenting their tank

management practices.<p>

The goal of the program, which has the working title "Alice," is to incorporate

good UST management into common business practices, said OUST's Sammy Ng, who is

in charge of developing the concept for the agency. Some entities already

require tank owners to provide assessments of their UST maintenance as a

transaction condition. For example, bank regulating agencies such as the Federal

Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal and National Mortgage Association

instruct banks to require environmental assessments, he said. But the types of

assessments vary.<p>

The purpose of the inspection program would be to create a standardized document

describing a facility's past UST maintenance that would be universally accepted

by lenders, members of the real estate and insurance industries, state

regulatory agencies, EPA and the consulting community, said OUST Acting Director

Lisa Lund. The document would give these entities a certain level of assurance

about the quality of tank management at a facility, Lund said. For instance, it

would help lenders assess the financial risk of loaning money to a tank owner or

speed property transfers, she said.<p>

The idea is for real estate, banking and insurance regulatory agencies to

instruct businesses to require the document as part of their national guidelines

on environmental issues, Ng said. This would help them evaluate the risk posed

by USTs and make transactions easier, he said. <p>

OUST has approached lenders and members of the real estate and insurance

industries about ways to create market incentives for proper tank management, Ng

said. These groups are realizing that they too have an interest in managing USTs

on commercial properties, EPA said. Properly maintained, USTs "have been and

continue to be an asset to a property. There are safe and accepted ways to

operate tanks so that they remain assets ... and it will be mutually beneficial

for EPA, states and interested private industries to join forces in ensuring

good tank management." The Alice concept was suggested by members of the real

estate industry who need a standardized method for documenting UST maintenance

to simplify transactions at closure, Ng noted. <p>

The inspection program would contain different tiers or levels of analysis--to be

determined by ASTM--for meeting different end-users' needs, Ng said. For example,

an Alice 1 could be a rudimentary assessment of tanks that might be required

annually under the terms of a loan agreement, he said. An Alice 3 could be a

full-blown site assessment involving installation of probes that might be

required by banks for major mortgages or facility upgrades, he said.<p>

The concept is akin to Pennsylvania's third-party service provider program in

which private consultants perform legally required inspections paid for by the

tank owner, Lund said. The twist is that OUST is asking ASTM to develop training

materials and train consultants on how to perform the inspections, she said.

ASTM would not license or certify the consultants, however. OUST is considering

working with the Air and Waste Management Association to certify or license the

inspectors, Ng said.<p>

States may consider using Alice as part of their enforcement programs, Ng said.

For instance, they could give certain benefits to certificate-holding tank

owners and focus inspection efforts on facilities that have not been inspected,

he said.<p>

The first meeting of the ASTM task group for the standard is June 17, Ng said.

OUST would like to have a standard adopted by the middle of next year and does

not anticipate a lengthy licensing or certification process for inspectors, he

said. The agency hopes that having a standardized "proof-of-compliance" document

will facilitate the loan process for tank upgrades to meet the 1998 deadline, he

said.<p>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>OMB Circular A-133, <I>Audits of Institutions of Higher Education
and Other Non-Profit Institutions</I></H3>
</P>

<P>
OMB has proposed revisions to Circular A-133 that would bring state and local governments under the circular, permit biennial audits in certain circumstances and address the allowability of audit costs for subrecipients. The proposal was published in the Nov. 5, 1996, <i>Federal Register</i>, and comments are due to OMB by Jan. 6, 1997. OMB plans to rescind Circular A-128, <i>Audits of State and
Local Governments</i>, when the proposal is finalized. These changes would fully implement the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (P.L. 104-156), which applies to audits of fiscal years ending after June 30, 1996. Many of the new statutory requirements had already been incorporated into Circular A-133 when OMB revised it in April 1996. The <i>Single Audit Information Service</i> provides complete analyses of audit-related OMB circulars and proposals. <A HREF="/tpg/fed_gts/sass/sass_a133.html">Click here to retrieve the proposal.</A><P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>OMB Compliance Supplement</H3>
</P>

<P>
OMB plans to issue an initial draft of an updated compliance supplement that is
used by auditors performing single audits and other financial and compliance
audits of federal assistance recipients. The new compliance supplement will
incorporate provisions of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, as well as OMB
Circular A-133. As the revision progresses, up-to-date information on the status
of the proposal will be provided here by the editors of the <I>Single Audit
Information Service</I>.

<P>
<B>ACTION:</B> Proposed Revision of OMB Circular No. A-133 and Proposed Rescission
of OMB Circular No. A-128
</P>

<HR>
<P>
<B>SUMMARY:</B> This Notice offers interested parties an opportunity to comment on further proposed revisions to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-133, "Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Institutions," and the proposed consolidation of OMB Circular No. A-128, "Audits of State and Local Governments," into Circular No. A-133 (with Circular A-128 being rescinded). This Notice also requests comment on two proposed information collections contained in the proposed revision to Circular A-133. These actions are being proposed to implement the Single
Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (1996 Amendments), which were signed into law on July 5, 1996 (P.L. 104-156).
</P>

<P>
In the proposed revisions to Circular A-133, as published in the <I>Federal Register</I> on March 17, 1995 (60 FR 14594), OMB stated an intent to seek modifications to the Single Audit Act of 1984 (1984 Act) and, upon passage, extend the provisions of Circular A-133 to include audits of States and
local governments and then rescind Circular A-128. (Indian tribal governments are included under the definition of States and are covered under the 1984 Act, Circular A-128, the 1996 Amendments, and this proposed revision.) The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 was coordinated with
the 1996 Amendments such that only minimum changes are now necessary to include States and local governments under Circular A-133. When States and local governments are covered under Circular A-133, OMB will rescind Circular A-128.
</P>

<P>
Interested parties may wish to refer to the March 17, 1995, and April 30, 1996, <I>Federal Register</I> (61 FR 19134) for a more detailed discussion of the changes made during the recent revisions to Circular A-133.
</P>

<P>
<B>DATES:</B> All comments on this proposal should be in writing, and must be received by [60 days after publication]. Late comments will be considered to the extent practicable.
</P>

<P>
<B>ADDRESSES:</B> Comments should be mailed to Office of Management and Budget, Office of Federal Financial Management, Financial Standards and Reporting Branch, Room 6025, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Where possible, comments should reference applicable paragraph or section
numbers in the proposed revision. When comments are sent in by facsimile (fax), they should be faxed to (202) 395-4915. Electronic mail comments may be submitted via Internet to CONLEY_S@A1.EOP.GOV. Please include the full body of electronic mail comments in the text of the message and not as an
attachment. Please include the name, title, organization, postal address, and E-mail address in the text of the message. 
</P>

<P>
To facilitate conversion of the comments into a computer format for analysis, it would be helpful if respondents send a copy of comments on either a 3.5 or 5.25 inch diskette in either WordPerfect 5.1, WordPerfect for Windows, or ASCII format. When a diskette cannot be provided, it would be helpful if the comments were printed in pica or an equivalent 10 characters per inch type on white paper so the document can be easily scanned into a computer format.
</P>

<P>
A copy of the current Circulars A-128 and A-133 may be obtained from the OMB fax information line, 202-395-9068, document numbers 1128 and 1133, respectively, or by writing or calling the Office of Administration, Publications Office, Room 2200, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, telephone (202) 395-7332. Also, Circular A-133 and this proposed revision are available on the OMB home page on the internet which is currently located at http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OMB/html/ombhome.html.
</P>

<P>
<B>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</B> Sheila O. Conley, Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM), Financial Standards and Reporting Branch, OMB telephone (202) 395-3993 and fax (202) 395-4915. A redlined/strikeout version showing the detailed changes between the recently revised OMB
Circular A-133 and the further proposed revision is available by written request to OFFM.
</P>

<P>
<B>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</B> Pursuant to the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (P.L. 104-156), the proposed revision requires non-Federal entities (States, local governments, and non-profit organizations) expending $300,000 or more in a year in Federal awards to have an audit, sets forth
requirements for both the performance and reporting of this audit, and provides for follow-up on audit findings. Each non-Federal entity is responsible for having its audit conducted and ensuring that subrecipients expending $300,000 or more in a year meet the audit requirements of Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133 which will be renamed "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations."
</P>

<H3>Significant Changes from Circular A-128 to Circular A-133</H3>

<P>
The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, signed by the President on July 5, 1996, called for uniform requirements for audits of all types of organizations. As a consequence, OMB proposes to co-locate requirements for States, local governments, and non-profit organizations in Circular A-133, which currently addresses only non-profit organizations. At the same time, OMB would rescind Circular A-128, "Audits of State and Local Governments," which currently specifies audit requirements for States and local governments.
</P>

<P>
The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 includes the following major changes which are not reflected in Circular A-128 issued April 12, 1985:
</P>

<P>
(1) increased the threshold that triggers an audit requirement under the Circular from $25,000 to $300,000 (&#167;___.200(a));
</P>

<P>
(2) prescribed a risk-based approach to determine major programs (&#167;___.520); 
</P>

<P>
(3) required a minimum major program coverage of 50 percent (25 percent for low-risk auditees) of Federal awards expended (&#167;___.520(f));
</P>

<P>
(4) clarified the required level of internal control testing (&#167;___.500(c));
</P>

<P>
(5) provided minimum reporting requirements for the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards (&#167;___.310(b));
</P>

<P>
(6) required auditees to prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings (&#167;___.315) and a data collection form (&#167;___.320(b));
</P>

<P>
(7) required auditors to report audit findings and questioned costs in a single schedule, including a summary of the auditor's results (&#167;___.505(a)(4));
</P>

<P>
(8) prescribed criteria for reporting audit findings and questioned costs (&#167;___.510);
</P>

<P>
(9) modified the method of determining the cognizant agency for audit (&#167;___.400(a));
</P>

<P>
(10) after a two-year transition period, precluded the same auditor from preparing the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan when indirect costs exceeded $1 million in the prior year (&#167;___.305(b));
</P>

<P>
(11) after a two-year transition period, shortened the due date for submitting reports from 13 months to nine months (&#167;___.320(a));
</P>

<P>
(12) streamlined the report submission process and expanded the role of the Federal clearinghouse (&#167;___.320);
</P>

<P>
(13) changed the basis for determining the amount of Federal awards administered by the non-Federal entity from receipts to expenditures (&#167;___.200);
</P>

<P>
(14) provided guidance for conducting program-specific audits (&#167;___.235); and,
</P>

<P>
(15) reorganized the Circular into a "common rule" format to facilitate codification by Federal agencies and improve the presentation of information included in the Circular.
</P>

<H3>Significant Proposed Revisions to Circular A-133</H3>

<P>
The most significant difference between this proposed revision and the recently revised Circular A-133 is the inclusion of States and local governments. This proposed revision also includes changes relating to the effective date (31 U.S.C. 7507), the provisions permitting biennial audits in limited circumstances (31 U.S.C. 7502(b)(2) and (3)), and the allowability of audit costs (31 U.S.C. 7505(b)(1)(A)(ii)) to conform the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 to the 1996 Amendments. Aside from these changes, the 1996 Amendments do not require other substantive changes to Circular A-133.
</P>

<P>
The following discussion is provided to describe the changes needed to conform this proposed revision with the 1996 Amendments, solicit input from interested parties, and summarize some of the other changes included in this proposed revision. The readers' attention is directed to section D. Proposed
Requirement for the Auditor to Prepare and Sign the Data Collection Form Required by Circular A-133, because it is particularly important to OMB that commenters provide views on the matters discussed in this section.
</P>

<P>
<B>A. Effective Dates</B>
</P>

<P>
The 1996 Amendments apply to any non-Federal entity with respect to any of its fiscal years which begin after June 30, 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7507). Changes are proposed in paragraph 10 of the Circular, "Effective Dates," to reflect the effective dates mandated in the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
Inquirers asked which circular applies for biennial audits when the biennial period includes time before and after the effective date of the proposed revision. The 1996 Amendments do not specifically address the effective dates for biennial audits. OMB interprets the 1996 Amendments to be effective for any biennial periods which begin after June 30, 1996. As with annual audits, the prior circulars are in effect until this proposed revision is effective. Therefore, a non-Federal entity which elects a biennial audit and has a biennial period beginning on or before June 30, 1996, should apply the provisions of Circular A-128 issued April 12, 1985 (for a State or local government) or Circular A-133 issued March 8, 1990 (for a non-profit organization), as applicable. The requirements of this proposed revision apply to any biennial periods beginning after June 30, 1996.
</P>

<P>
Circular A-133 shortened the report due date from 13 months to nine months after the end of the audit period (&#167;___.320(a)). However, the 1996 Amendments (31 U.S.C. 7502(h)) provide for a transition period of at least two years during which the report due date would remain at 13 months. The proposed revision at &#167;___.320(a) incorporates this transition period such that the due date of nine months after the end of the audit period is not effective until audits of fiscal years beginning after June 30, 1998. Cognizant or oversight agencies may still provide extensions.
</P>

<P>
Paragraphs 6 and 10 of the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 instructed Federal agencies to adopt the standards set forth in the Circular in codified regulations not later than November 30, 1996. As a result of the 1996 Amendments, the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133, which applies
only to non-profit organizations, will not become operable unless this proposed revision is not finalized by June 30, 1997 (i.e., OMB expects that Circular A-133 issued March 8, 1990, will apply to non-profit organizations and Circular A-128 issued April 12, 1985, will apply to States and local governments prior to the effective dates of the 1996 Amendments, and this proposed revision will apply to these types of organizations when the 1996 Amendments become effective). Therefore, Federal agencies may forgo the requirement under the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 to adopt the standards set forth in the Circular in codified regulations not later than November 30, 1996. However, the 1996 Amendments (31 U.S.C. 7505(a)) require each Federal agency to promulgate such revisions to its regulations as may be necessary to conform such regulations to the requirements of the 1996 Amendments and OMB implementing guidance. Accordingly, the proposed revision includes a provision in paragraphs 6 and 10 of the Circular whereby Federal agencies shall adopt the standards set forth in the Circular in codified regulations not later than six months after publication of the final revision in the <I>Federal Register</I>.
</P>

<P>
<B>B. Biennial Audits in Limited Circumstances</B>
</P>

<P>
Changes are proposed at &#167;___.220 to permit biennial audits in limited circumstances in accordance with the 1996 Amendments. The provisions in the 1996 Amendments which allow non-Federal entities to elect a biennial audit are very specific (31 U.S.C. 7502(b)(2)and (3)). For a State or local government to qualify for a biennial audit election, there must be a <I>requirement</I> (as opposed to authorization) in a State's constitution or State or local law which was in effect on January 1, 1987. Also, this <I>requirement</I> must still be in effect. Only non-profit organizations that had biennial
audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, may elect a biennial audit. OMB expects that very few States, local governments, or non-profit organizations meet this criteria. Nonetheless, all auditees are encouraged to have annual audits which provide increased
accountability.
</P>

<P>
The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 includes a provision whereby a Federal agency or pass-through agency may allow a non-profit organization that elects a program-specific audit under &#167;___.200(c) to perform the audit every two years. This provision was removed from the proposed revision to conform with the biennial audit requirements specified in the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
Changes are also proposed at &#167;___.520 and &#167;___.530(a) to the major program determination process and the criteria for low-risk auditee for situations which are unique to single audits which are performed on a biennial basis.
</P>

<P>
<B>C. Audit Costs Prohibited for Subrecipients with Federal Awards Expended of Less Than $300,000 Annually</B>
</P>

<P>
The 1996 Amendments discourage pass-through entities from requiring single audits of subrecipients with total Federal awards expended of less than $300,000 annually. This is done by prohibiting charges to Federal awards for audit costs under these circumstances (31 U.S.C. 7505(b)(1)(A)(ii)).
However, pass-through entities are not prohibited from charging subrecipient monitoring costs, provided those procedures are of lesser scope than a single audit.
</P>

<P>
For example, if a pass-through entity requires a subrecipient which expends less than $300,000 annually in total Federal awards to have a single audit conducted in accordance with the 1996 Amendments, this audit must be paid for with other than Federal funds. However, the 1996 Amendments do not prohibit charging Federal awards for limited scope audits and other subrecipient monitoring procedures.
</P>

<P>
Pass-through entities would need to make appropriate changes in their agreements with subrecipients to reflect that audits will no longer be required for non-Federal entities with total Federal awards expended of less than $300,000 annually. Pass-through entities will need to review their overall subrecipient monitoring process, and decide what, if any, additional monitoring procedures may be necessary to ensure subrecipient compliance. Monitoring procedures, which include limited scope audits, can be more targeted and less costly than a full Circular A-133 audit. Subrecipient
monitoring procedures include: on-site visits, reviews of documentation supporting requests for reimbursement, limited scope audits of specific compliance areas (e.g., eligibility determinations made by subrecipients), and financial statement audits in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards. A pass-through entity should consider the cost-effectiveness of monitoring procedures compared to the relative size and complexity of the Federal awards administered by subrecipients in determining the appropriateness of monitoring procedures.
</P>

<P>
<B>D. Proposed Requirement for the Auditor to Prepare and Sign the Data Collection Form Required by Circular A-133</B>
</P>

<P>
To streamline the distribution of audit reports and improve the governmentwide collection and analysis of single audit results, Circular A-133 provides for a machine-readable form (&#167;___.320(b)) to be prepared at the completion of each audit and submitted to the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB and pass-through entities. The data collection form will provide key information about the non-Federal entity, the Federal awards it administers, and the audit results. It will serve as the basis for developing a governmentwide database on covered Federal awards administered by non-Federal entities. The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 provides for a data collection form to be submitted to the Federal clearinghouse and each pass-through entity in lieu of sending the full single audit reporting package when there are no audit findings.
</P>

<P>
The April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 requires the auditee's management to prepare the data collection form. Many auditees are concerned about the additional burden this reporting requirement would place on them. A more efficient and effective method could be to have the auditor prepare the form and sign it as preparer. OMB believes this would not significantly increase audit costs, since most of the information requested on the form will be obtained directly from the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards and the auditor's reports. Since the auditor is most knowledgeable about the audit results, OMB expects that it will be efficient for the auditor to simply prepare the form at the completion of the audit. Also, OMB believes that the incremental legal exposure faced by the auditor as a result of signing the form can be minimized by restricting its use to the Federal
clearinghouse and pass-through entities for the sole purpose of data collection and so stating on the form. Under this method, the auditee would continue to be required to provide assurance to the Federal Government and pass-through entities that the auditee engaged an auditor to conduct an
audit in accordance with the Circular, that the audit was completed, and that the information included on the form is accurate. 
</P>

<P>
OMB believes that the auditor's association with the data collection form will add value to its usefulness, reduce the need for Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities to perform unnecessary verification procedures, improve the accuracy of the governmentwide database, streamline
the single audit report submission process, and reduce burden on auditees.
</P>

<P>
Therefore, OMB is considering adding a provision that requires the auditor to prepare the data collection form and sign it. If this change is made, OMB will work with the auditing profession and other interested parties to develop any necessary revisions to the form. Respondents are encouraged to comment on this change, including: whether the auditor should prepare and sign the data collection form; what would be the estimated cost of the auditor's performing this service; whether it would be beneficial to auditees, Federal agencies, and pass-through entities; and, whether there are concerns over litigation exposure.
</P>

<P>
The name of the certification form required under &#167;___.320(b) of the April 1996 revision of Circular A-133 is changed to "Data Collection Form" in the proposed revision to more appropriately characterize the nature of the information request. This name change also affects #167;___.235(c)(2), &#167;___.235(c)(3), &#167;___.320(c), &#167;___.320(e)(i), and &#167;___.320(h).
</P>

<P>
<B>E. Audit Coverage Over the Allowability of Charges to Cost Pools</B>
</P>

<P>
Changes are proposed at &#167;___.500(c), &#167;___.500(d), &#167;___.505(b), &#167;___.505(c), and &#167;___.510(a) to clarify the auditor's responsibility for testing and reporting on the allowability of costs charged to cost pools: (1) used to support an indirect cost rate, or (2) allocated through a State/local-wide central service cost allocation plan (as fully described in Appendix C of Circular A-87, "Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments," issued May 4, 1995 (60 FR 26484), and hereinafter referred to as a "cost allocation plan"). The proposed language is added to address the timing of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. Indirect cost rates are based on costs incurred in a base period and applied prospectively. Costs allocated through a cost allocation plan are based on the actual costs incurred in two previous years.
</P>

<P>
Because it would not be practical to perform such tests retroactively, the auditor is expected to perform tests of costs charged to cost pools during the period that the actual costs were incurred, rather than during the period in which the rate was applied or in which the costs were allocated.
For example, if the actual costs charged to cost pools for 1997 form the basis for the indirect cost proposal and the final negotiated indirect cost rate that will be applied in 1998 and 1999, then the auditor should test actual costs charged to cost pools during 1997 as part of the 1997 audit, since 1997 is the base year. The auditor would not be expected to test such costs as part of the 1998 and 1999 audits.
</P>

<P>
<B>F. Pilot Project Authority</B>
</P>

<P>
The 1996 Amendments (31 U.S.C. 7502(j)) authorize OMB, in consultation with the Chair and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Chair and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of the House of
Representatives, to approve pilot projects to test alternative methods of achieving the purposes of the 1996 Amendments. Such pilot projects, which would be voluntary undertakings by non-Federal entities, would provide a means of assessing new ways of testing and reporting on Federal awards.
</P>

<P>
Suggestions from auditees for pilot projects should be submitted first to Federal funding agencies. If a Federal agency concludes that a suggested pilot project has merit, the Federal agency may present the suggestion to OMB for consideration. OMB will consult with the appropriate members of the
House and Senate prior to authorizing any pilot projects under the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
<B>G. Other Changes to Comply with the 1996 Amendments</B>
</P>

<P>
The revision proposes the following other changes to comply with the 1996 Amendments and include States and local governments under Circular A-133.
</P>

<P>
(1) Retitles the Circular to include States and local governments. States and local governments were also added to paragraph 1 of the Circular. 
</P>

<P>
(2) Deletes the references to Circular A-128 from paragraph 4 of the Circular and sections &#167;___.105(x)(2) and &#167;___.400(d)(4) of the attachment.

(4) Adds definitions for the terms "Indian tribe" (&#167;___.105(p)), "local government" (&#167;___.105(t)), and "State" (&#167;___.105(gg)), which are defined terms in the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
(5) Adds definitions for the term "non-Federal entity" (&#167;___.105(w)) and replaces the term "non-profit organization" with "non-Federal entity" in paragraphs 4, 6, and 10 of the Circular and sections &#167;___.100, &#167;___.105(a), &#167;___.105(s), &#167;___.105(aa), &#167;___.105(dd), &#167;___.105(ee), &#167;___.200(d), &#167;___.205(a), and &#167;___.205(h) of the attachment.
</P>

<P>
(6) Replaces the term "non-profit organization" with "subrecipient" in &#167;___.205(i).
</P>

</P>

<P>
(10) Adds reference to Grants Management Common Rule in &#167;___.305(a).
</P>

audits.
</P>

<P>
(14) Drops from &#167;___.520(b)(3) the reference to insurance programs because insurance programs are not specifically cited in the 1996 Amendments.
</P>

<P>
<B>H. Other Changes</B>
</P>

<P>
The revision proposes the following detailed changes.
</P>

<P>
(1) Adds to &#167;___.235(c)(3) a requirement that one copy of the data collection form prepared in accordance with &#167;___.320(b) be submitted to each pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
(2) Adds to &#167;___.320(b) a requirement that the auditee identify the cognizant or oversight agency for audit on the data collection form.
</P>

<P>
(3) Changes the requirement in &#167;___.400(a)(4) for the cognizant agency for audit to report to other Federal agencies any direct reporting of irregularities and illegal acts.
</P>

<P>
(4) Simplifies the summary of the auditor's results in &#167;___.505 by removing the requirement for a statement concerning the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern and consolidating the reporting of audit findings which were not reportable conditions or material non-compliance.
</P>

<P>
(5) Adds to the definition of audit findings reported (&#167;___.510(a)(4)) known questioned costs greater than $10,000 for Federal programs which are not audited as major programs. Consistent with this, adds in &#167;___.520(c) a reference to this requirement.
</P>

<P>
(6) Removes from &#167;___.510(a)(6) the definition of fraud because this term is the same as in professional auditing standards.
</P>

<P>
(7) Adds in &#167;___.520(d) and &#167;___.520(e) an option to allow an auditor to minimize the risk assessment required for Type B programs under certain circumstances.
</P>

<P>
(8) Adds in &#167;___.520(e) a statement to encourage auditors to use an approach in identifying high-risk Type B program which provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major over a period of time.
</P>

<P>
<B>I. Changes for Clarity</B>
</P>

<P>
The revision proposes the following changes for clarity.
</P>

<P>
(1) Changes the title of the Circular to use the term "non-profit organizations" in lieu of the phrase "institutions of higher education and other non-profit institutions" since non-profit organization is the defined term (&#167;___.105(x)) which includes non-profit institutions of higher
education.
</P>

<P>
(2) Changes the definitions of cluster of programs (&#167;___.105(e)) and Federal programs (&#167;___.105(m)) to clarify that research and development (R&amp;D) and student financial aid (SFA) are types of clusters of programs. Based upon this change, the phrase "category of programs" was replaced with "cluster of programs" in &#167;___.105(m), &#167;___.310(b)(6), &#167;___.320(b). Moves discussion of State governments combining funding from definition of Federal programs (&#167;___.105(m)) to definition of cluster of programs (&#167;___.105(e)). Adds to &#167;___.105(e) emphasis that when a State designates a cluster of programs, the State must identify the Federal awards and advise subrecipients of the applicable compliance requirements.
</P>

<P>
(3) Replaces the reference to "Federal expenditures" with "Federal awards expended" in &#167;___.200(d), &#167;___.310(b)(2), &#167;___.310(b)(6), &#167;___.310(b)(7), &#167;___.520(b)(1), &#167;___.520(d)(2), &#167;___.520(f), &#167;___.525(d)(4), &#167;___.530(d)(3).
</P>

<P>
(4) For consistency with the format of the effective date of the Circular, changes the date format from fiscal years "ending" to fiscal years "beginning" in &#167;___.305(b).
</P>

<P>
(5) Clarifies in &#167;___.315(b) that follow-up on prior audit findings is concerned with those relative to Federal awards as opposed to those relative to the financial statements of the entity.
</P>

<P>
(6) Clarifies in &#167;___.500(a) that the entity's financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards must be for the same fiscal year.
</P>

<P>
(7) Replaces in &#167;___.500(c) the term "achieve" with "support."
</P>

<P>
(8) Clarifies in &#167;___.510(a)(2) that this reporting only relates to major programs and removes discussion relating to auditor conclusions which is included in generally accepted government auditing standards.
</P>

<P>
(9) Clarifies in &#167;___.510(a)(5) and &#167;___.510(a)(6) that the reference to the schedule of findings and questioned costs is to the part of the schedule that deals with Federal awards.
</P>

<P>
(10) Changes the term "50 percent rule" to "percentage of coverage rule" in &#167;___.520(d)(2), &#167;___.520(e)(3), &#167;___.520(f), &#167;___.520(i).
</P>

<P>
(11) Clarifies in &#167;___.530(d) that this provision applies for either of the preceding two years in which the program was classified as a Type A program.
</P>

<P>
<B>Information Collection Activity Under OMB Review</B>
</P>

<P>
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 et seq.), this notice requests comment on the following two proposed information collections contained in this proposed revision. The information collection request involves two types of entities: (1) reports from auditors to auditees concerning audit results, audit findings, and questioned costs; and, (2) reports from auditees to the Federal Government providing information about the auditees, the awards they administer, and the audit results. The proposed revision specifies what auditors are required to
report to auditees, under &#167;___.235(b)(4), for program-specific audits, and &#167;___.505, "Audit Reporting," for single audits. The proposed revision also specifies what auditees are required to report to the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB and pass-through entities, if applicable, under
&#167;___.235(c), for program-specific audits, and &#167;___.320, "Report Submission," for single audits.
</P>

<P>
The information collection requests included in this proposal would result in a decrease in overall reporting burden. Although the reporting burden per audit will increase under this proposal from 26 to 34 hours (described in the following paragraphs), fewer entities will be subject to the reporting
requirements as a result of the proposal to increase the threshold that triggers an audit requirement under the Circular from $25,000 to $300,000. Based on available information, OMB estimates that approximately 25,000 non-Federal entities would be subject to the information collection requirement included in this proposal; whereas, approximately 35,000 non-Federal entities are subject to the current requirements under Circulars A-128 and A-133. The overall reporting burden currently approximates 910,000 hours (35,000 non-Federal entities at 26 hours per audit). Under the proposal, the overall reporting burden would be approximately 850,000 hours (25,000 non-Federal entities at 34 hours per audit), or 60,000 hours less than the current reporting burden. In addition, as more fully discussed below, there is an opportunity to reduce further the overall reporting burden under the proposal from 850,000 to 800,000 hours by having auditors, rather than auditees, prepare the data collection form discussed below.
</P>

<P>
Congress intended to improve the contents of single audit reports to make them more useful by enacting the 1996 Amendments. OMB believes that the increase in reporting burden per audit is warranted because several changes included in the proposed revision would improve the usefulness and
effectiveness of single audit reporting with respect to information provided by both auditors and auditees.
</P>

<P>
OMB estimates that reporting by <I>auditors</I> currently takes approximately 10 hours on the average per audit under Circulars A-128 and A-133, and will take 14 hours under the proposal. The estimated increase of 4 hours of reporting burden per audit on <I>auditors</I> is due primarily to a provision in the 1996 Amendments (31 U.S.C. 7502(g)(2)) which requires the auditor, for the first time, to prepare a summary of audit results. In its report on the 1996 Amendments, the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight stated that "the complexity of the reports makes it difficult for the average reader to understand what has been audited and reported ... A summary of the audit results would highlight important information and thus enable users to quickly discern the overall results of an audit" (H.R. Report 104-607, page 18).
</P>

<P>
OMB estimates that reporting by <I>auditees</I> currently takes approximately 16 hours on the average per audit under Circulars A-128 and A-133, and will take 20 hours under the proposal. The estimated increase of 4 hours of reporting burden per audit on <I>auditees</I> is due primarily to a proposed
requirement whereby management would prepare two new documents to improve the usefulness of single audit reports.
</P>

<P>
The first of these reports is a summary schedule of prior audit findings which will provide the current status of previously reported audit findings until such findings are corrected. This information, which is important to Federal funding agencies and pass-through entities, is currently required under Circulars A-128 and A-133 but it is not consistently provided in single audit reports. As a result, Federal funding agencies and pass-through entities frequently request this type of information long after a finding is reported, which results in additional burden on Federal agencies, auditees, and auditors. The proposed requirements provide additional guidance to auditees on where and how to present information regarding prior audit findings. While additional time may be required up-front for certain auditees to prepare the summary schedule of prior audit findings, the reporting burden for such entities should be offset by the elimination of the inefficiencies caused by the current practice of having to retrieve and provide information after-the-fact on old audit findings. 
</P>

<P>
The second report management would be required to prepare is the "Data Collection Form" prescribed in &#167;___.320(b) of the proposed revision and discussed previously in Section D (Proposed Requirement for the Auditor to Prepare and Sign the Data Collection Form Required by Circular A-133). The data collection form will facilitate streamlining the report distribution process and improve the governmentwide collection and analysis of single audit results.
</P>

<P>
OMB believes that the overall reporting burden under the proposed revision could be further reduced by having the auditor prepare the data collection form. Specifically, OMB estimates that if <I>auditors</I>, rather than <I>auditees</I>, prepare the data collection form then the estimate of reporting burden on auditors would <I>increase</I> by two hours (that is, from 14 hours to 16 hours), and the estimate of reporting burden on auditees would <I>decrease</I> by four hours (that is, from 20 hours to 16 hours) per audit under the proposal. This would result in a <I>net</I> decrease of 2 hours per audit, or 50,000 hours in overall reporting burden (25,000 non-Federal entities at 2 hours savings per audit). As a result of having auditors, rather than auditees, prepare the data collection form, overall reporting burden could be reduced from 850,000 to 800,000 hours.
</P>

<P>
Comments are invited on: (a) whether the proposed information collection is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agencies, including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the estimate of the burden of the collection of the information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden related to the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.

<B>&#167;___.100 Purpose.
</B></P>

<P>
This part sets forth standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of non-Federal entities expending Federal awards.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.105 Definitions.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Auditee</I> means any non-Federal entity that expends Federal awards which must be audited under this part.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Auditor</I> means an auditor, that is a public accountant or a Federal, State or local government audit organization, which meets the general standards specified in generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS). The term <I>auditor</I> does not include internal auditors of non-profit organizations.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Audit finding</I> means deficiencies which the auditor is required by &#167;___.510(a) to report in the schedule of findings and questioned costs.
</P>

<P>
(d) <I>CFDA number</I> means the number assigned to a Federal program in the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I> (CFDA).
</P>

<P>
(e) <I>Cluster of programs</I> means a grouping of closely related programs that share common compliance requirements. The types of clusters of programs are research and development (R&amp;D), student financial aid (SFA), and other clusters.

<P>
<B>&#167;___.200 Audit requirements.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Audit required.</I> Non-Federal entities that expend $300,000 or more in a year in Federal awards shall have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this part. Guidance on determining Federal awards expended is provided in &#167;___.205.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Single audit.</I> Non-Federal entities that expend $300,000 or more in a year in Federal awards shall have a single audit conducted in accordance with &#167;___.500 except when they elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Program-specific audit election.</I> When an auditee expends Federal awards under only one Federal program (excluding R&amp;D) and the Federal program's laws, regulations, or grant agreements do not require a financial statement audit of the auditee, the auditee may elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with &#167;___.235. A program-specific audit may not be elected for R&amp;D unless all of the Federal awards expended were received from the same Federal agency, or the same Federal agency and the same pass-through entity, and that Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, approves in advance a program-specific audit.
</P>

<P>
(d) <I>Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $300,000.</I> Non-Federal entities that expend less than $300,000 a year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted in &#167;___.215(a), but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and General Accounting Office (GAO).
</P>

<P>
(e) <I>Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC).</I> Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.
</P>


<P>
<B>&#167;___.205 Basis for determining Federal awards expended.
</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Determining Federal awards expended.</I> The determination of when an award is expended should be based on when the activity related to the award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements, such as: expenditure/expense transactions associated with grants, cost-reimbursement contracts, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds passed through to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or consumption of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and, the period when insurance is in force.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Loan and loan guarantees (loans).</I> Since the Federal Government is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid, the following guidelines shall be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under loan programs, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Value of new loans made or received during the fiscal year; plus
</P>

<P>
     (2) Balance of loans from previous years for which the Federal Government imposes continuing compliance requirements; plus
</P>

<P>
     (3) Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance received.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at institutions of higher education.</I> When loans are made to students of an institution of higher education but the institution does not make the loans, then only the value of loans made during the year shall be considered Federal awards expended in that year. The balance of loans for previous years is not included as Federal awards expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.
</P>

<P>
(d) <I>Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans).</I> Loans, the proceeds of which were received and expended in prior-years, are not considered Federal awards expended under this part when the laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements pertaining to such loans impose no continuing compliance requirements other than to repay the loans.
</P>

<P>
(e) <I>Endowment funds.</I> The cumulative balance of Federal awards for endowment funds which are federally restricted are considered awards expended in each year in which the funds are still restricted.
</P>

<P>
(f) <I>Free rent.</I> Free rent received by itself is not considered a Federal award expended under this part. However, free rent received as part of an award to carry out a Federal program shall be included in determining Federal awards expended and subject to audit under this part.
</P>

<P>
(g) <I>Valuing non-cash assistance.</I> Federal non-cash assistance, such as free rent, food stamps, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property, shall be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by the Federal agency.
</P>

<P>
(h) <I>Medicare.</I> Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for providing patient care services to Medicare eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part.
</P>

<P>
(i) <I>Medicaid.</I> Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing patient care services to Medicaid eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a State requires the funds to be treated as Federal awards expended because reimbursement is on a cost-reimbursement basis.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.210 Subrecipient and vendor determinations.
</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a vendor. Federal awards expended as a recipient or a subrecipient would be subject to audit under this part. The payments received for goods or services provided as a vendor would not be considered Federal awards. The guidance in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section should be considered in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods and services.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Federal award.</I> Characteristics indicative of a Federal award received by a subrecipient are when the organization:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Determines who is eligible to receive what Federal financial assistance;
</P>

<P>
     (2) Has its performance measured against whether the objectives of the Federal program are met;
</P>

<P>
     (3) Has responsibility for programmatic decision making; 
    
</P> 
<P>
     (4) Has responsibility for adherence to applicable Federal program compliance requirements; and
</P>

<P>
     (5) Uses the Federal funds to carry out a program of the organization as compared to providing goods or services for a program of the pass-through entity.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Payment for goods and services.</I> Characteristics indicative of a payment for goods and services received by a vendor are when the organization:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Provides the goods and services within normal business operations;
</P>

<P>
     (2) Provides similar goods or services to many different purchasers;
</P>

<P>
     (3) Operates in a competitive environment;
</P>

<P>
     (4) Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the operation of the Federal program; and
</P>

<P>
     (5) Is not subject to compliance requirements of the Federal program.
</P></UL>

<P>
(d) <I>Use of judgment in making determination.</I> There may be unusual circumstances or exceptions to the listed characteristics. In making the determination of whether a subrecipient or vendor relationship exists, the substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement. It is not expected that all of the characteristics will be present and judgment should be used in determining whether an entity is a subrecipient or vendor.
</P>

<P>
(e) <I>For-profit subrecipient.</I> Since this part does not apply to for-profit subrecipients, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements, as necessary, to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients. The contract with the for-profit subrecipient should describe applicable compliance requirements and the for-profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the contract, and post-award audits.
</P>

<P>
(f) <I>Compliance responsibility for vendors.</I> In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for vendors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements. Program compliance requirements normally do not pass through to vendors. However, the auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for vendor transactions which are structured such that the vendor is responsible for program compliance or the vendor's records must be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these vendor transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit shall include determining whether these transactions are in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.215 Relation to other audit requirements.
</B></P>

<P>
(a) <I>Audit under this part in lieu of other audits.</I> An audit made in accordance with this part shall be in lieu of any financial audit required under individual Federal awards. To the extent this audit meets a Federal agency's needs, it shall rely upon and use such audits. The provisions of this part neither limit the authority of Federal agencies, including their Inspectors General, or GAO to conduct or arrange for additional audits (e.g., financial audits, performance audits, evaluations, inspections, or reviews) nor authorize any auditee to constrain Federal agencies from carrying out additional audits. Any additional audits shall be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed by other auditors.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Federal agency to pay for additional audits.</I> A Federal agency that conducts or contracts for additional audits shall, consistent with other applicable laws and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Request for a program to be audited as a major program.</I> A Federal agency may request an auditee to have a particular Federal program audited as a major program in lieu of the Federal agency conducting or arranging for the additional audits. To allow for planning, such requests should be made at least 180 days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited. The auditee, after consultation with its auditor, should promptly respond to such request by informing the Federal agency whether the program would otherwise be audited as a major program using the risk-based audit approach described in &#167;___.520 and, if not, the estimated incremental cost. The Federal agency shall then promptly confirm to the auditee whether it wants the program audited as a major program. If the program is to be audited as a major program based upon this Federal agency request, and the Federal agency agrees to pay the full incremental costs, then the auditee shall have the program audited as a major program. A pass-through entity may use the provisions of this paragraph for a subrecipient.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.220 Frequency of audits.</B>
</P>

<P>
Except for the provisions for biennial audits provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, audits required by this part shall be performed annually. Any biennial audit shall cover both years within the biennial period.
</P>

<P>
(a) A State or local government that is required by constitution or statute, in effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo its audits less frequently than annually, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially. This requirement must still be in effect for the biennial period
under audit.
</P>

<P>
(b) Any non-profit organization that had biennial audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.225 Sanctions.</B>
</P>

<P>
No audit costs may be charged to Federal awards when audits required by this part have not been made or have been made but not in accordance with this part. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, Federal agencies and pass-through entities shall take appropriate action using sanctions such as:
</P>

<P>
(a) Withholding a percentage of Federal awards until the audit is completed satisfactorily;
</P>

<P>
(b) Withholding or disallowing overhead costs;
</P>

<P>
(c) Suspending Federal awards until the audit is conducted; or

(d) Terminating the Federal award.

<B>&#167;___.230 Audit costs.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Allowable costs.</I> Unless prohibited by law, the cost of audits made in accordance with the provisions of this part are allowable charges to Federal awards. The charges may be considered a direct cost or an allocated indirect cost, as determined in accordance with the provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR parts
30 and 31), or other applicable cost principles or regulations.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Unallowable costs.</I> A non-Federal entity shall not charge the following to a Federal award:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) The cost of any audit under the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501 <I>et seq</I>.) not conducted in accordance with this part.
</P>

<P>
     (2) The cost of auditing a non-Federal entity which has Federal awards expended of less than $300,000 per year and is thereby exempted under &#167;___.200(d) from having an audit conducted under this part. However, this does not prohibit a pass-through entity from charging Federal awards for the cost of limited scope audits to monitor its subrecipients in accordance with &#167;___.400(d)(3), provided the subrecipient does not have a single audit.
</P></UL>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.235 Program-specific audits.
</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Program-specific audit guide available.</I> In many cases, a program-specific audit guide will be available to provide specific guidance to the auditor with respect to internal control, compliance requirements, suggested audit procedures, and audit reporting requirements. The auditor should contact the Office of Inspector General of the Federal agency to determine whether such a guide is available. When a current program-specific audit guide is available, the auditor shall follow GAGAS and the guide when performing a program-specific audit.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Program-specific audit guide not available.</I> (1) When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor shall have basically the same responsibilities for the Federal program as they would have for an audit of a major program in a single audit.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (2) The auditee shall prepare the financial statement(s) for the Federal program that includes, at a minimum, a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the program and notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, a summary schedule of prior audit findings consistent with the requirements of &#167;___.315(b), and a corrective action plan consistent with the requirements of &#167;___.315(c).
</P>

<P>
     (3) The auditor shall:
</P>

<UL>

</P>

<P>
          (ii) Obtain an understanding of internal control and perform tests of internal control over the Federal program consistent with the requirements of &#167;___.500(c) for a major program;
</P>

          (iii) Perform procedures to determine whether the auditee has complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements that could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program consistent with the requirements of &#167;___.500(d) for a major program; and
</P>

<P>
          (iv) Follow up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee, and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding in accordance with the requirements of &#167;___.500(e).
</P></UL>

<P>
     (4) The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) shall state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statement(s) of the Federal program is presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with the stated accounting policies;
</P>

</B></P>


<P>
The auditee shall:
</P>

<P>
(a) Identify, in its accounts, all Federal awards received and expended and the Federal programs under which they were received. Federal program and award identification shall include, as applicable, the CFDA title and number, award number and year, name of the Federal agency, and name of the pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
(b) Maintain internal control over Federal programs that provides reasonable assurance that the auditee is managing Federal awards in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements that could have a material effect on each of its Federal programs.
</P>

<P>
(c) Comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements related to each of its Federal programs.
</P>

<P>
(d) Prepare appropriate financial statements, including the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards in accordance with &#167;___.310.
</P>

<P>
(e) Ensure that the audits required by this part are properly performed and submitted when due. When extensions to the report submission due date required by &#167;___.320(a) are granted by the cognizant or oversight agency for audit, promptly notify the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB and each pass-through entity providing Federal awards of the extension.
</P>

<P>
(f) Follow up and take corrective action on audit findings, including preparation of a summary schedule of prior audit findings and a corrective action plan in accordance with &#167;___.315(b) and &#167;___.315(c), respectively.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.305 Auditor selection.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Auditor procurement.</I> In arranging for audit services, auditees shall follow the procurement standards prescribed by the Grants Management Common Rule (GMCR) published March 11, 1988 (53 FR 8034) and amended April 19, 1995 (60 FR 19638), Circular A-110, "Uniform Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations," or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. Whenever possible, auditees shall make positive efforts to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, in procuring audit services as stated in GMCR, OMB Circular A-110, or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. In requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit should be made clear. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the
responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of external quality control reviews, and price.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Restriction on auditor preparing indirect cost proposals.</I> An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan may not also be selected to perform the audit required by this part when the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceeded $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used in the preparation of the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs. To minimize any disruption in existing contracts for audit services, this paragraph applies to audits of fiscal years beginning after June 30, 1998.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Use of Federal auditors.</I> Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this part if they comply fully with the requirements of this part.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.310 Financial statements.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Financial statements.</I> The auditee shall prepare financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements shall be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year that is
chosen to meet the requirements of this part.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards.</I> The auditee shall also prepare a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the period covered by the auditee's financial statements. While not required, it is appropriate for the auditee to provide information requested to make the schedule easier to use by Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities. For example,when a Federal program has multiple award years, the auditee may list the amount of each award year separately. At a minimum, the schedule shall:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) List individual Federal programs by Federal agency and major subdivision within a Federal agency. For Federal awards received as a subrecipient, the name of the pass-through entity and identifying number assigned by the pass-through entity shall be included.
</P>

<P>
     (2) Provide total Federal awards expended for each individual Federal program and the CFDA number or other identifying number when the CFDA information is not available.
</P>

<P>
     (3) Identify major programs.
</P>

<P>
     (4) Include notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule and identify in the notes the dollar threshold used to distinguish between Type A and Type B programs, as described in &#167;___.520(b).
</P>

<P>
     (5) To the extent practical, pass-through entities should identify in the schedule the total amount provided to subrecipients from each Type A program and from each Type B program which is audited as a major program.
</P>

<P>
     (6) List individual Federal awards within a cluster of programs. However, when it is not practical to list each individual Federal award for R&amp;D, total Federal awards expended shall be shown by Federal agency and major subdivision within the Federal agency. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision in the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>

<P>
     (7) Include, in either the schedule or a note to the schedule, the value of the Federal awards expended in the form of non-cash assistance, insurance in effect during the year, and loans or loan guarantees outstanding at year end.
</P></UL>

<B>&#167;___.315 Audit findings follow-up.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee shall prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee shall also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan shall include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under &#167;___.510(c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it shall include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Summary schedule of prior audit findings.</I> The summary schedule of prior audit findings shall report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs relative to Federal awards. The summary schedule shall also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.
</P>

<P>
     (2) When audit findings were not corrected or were only partially corrected, the summary schedule shall describe the planned corrective action as well as any partial corrective action taken.
</P>

<P>
     (3) When corrective action taken is significantly different from corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or in the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule shall provide an explanation.
</P>

<P>
     (4) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position shall be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to the Federal clearinghouse;
</P>

<P>
          (ii) The Federal agency or pass-through entity is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and
</P>

<P>
          (iii) A management decision was not issued.
</P></UL></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Corrective action plan.</I> At the completion of the audit, the auditee shall prepare a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the current year auditor's reports. The corrective action plan shall provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for
corrective action, the corrective action planned, and the anticipated completion date. If the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, then the corrective action plan shall include an explanation and specific reasons.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.320 Report submission.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The audit shall be completed and the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section submitted within nine months after the end of the audit period, unless a longer period is agreed to in advance by the cognizant or oversight agency for audit. (However, for fiscal years beginning on or before June 30, 1998, auditees shall have 13 months after the end of the audit period to complete the audit and submit the reporting package.) The reporting package shall be submitted within 30 days after issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee. Unless restricted by law or regulation, the auditee shall make copies available for public inspection.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Data Collection.</I> The auditee shall complete a data collection form which states whether the audit was completed in accordance with this part and provides information about the auditee, its Federal programs, and the results of the audit. The form shall be approved by OMB, available from the
Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB, include data elements similar to those presented in this paragraph, and use a machine-readable format. The auditee's chief executive officer or chief financial officer shall sign a statement that the information on the form is accurate and complete as
follows:
</P>

<P>
<B><CENTER>Certificate of Audit</CENTER></B>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.500 Scope of audit.
</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The audit shall be conducted in accordance with GAGAS. The audit shall cover the entire operations of the auditee; or, at the option of the auditee, such audit shall include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units which expended or otherwise administered Federal awards during such fiscal year, provided that each such audit shall encompass the financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for each such department, agency, and organizational unit, which shall be considered to be a non-Federal entity. The financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards shall be for the same fiscal year.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Financial statements.</I> The auditor shall determine whether the financial statements of the auditee are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The auditor shall also determine whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements taken as a whole.
</P>

<P>
(c) <I>Internal control.</I>
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor shall perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over Federal programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk for major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a State/local-wide central service cost allocation plan (as fully described in Appendix C of Circular A-87, "Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments," issued May 4, 1995 (60 FR 26484), and hereinafter referred to as a "cost allocation plan").
</P>

<P>
     (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the auditor shall:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) Plan the testing of internal control over major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan to support a low assessed level of control risk for the assertions relevant to the compliance requirements for each major program; and
</P>

<P>
          (ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
</P></UL>

<P>
     (3) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements for a major program and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor shall report a reportable condition or a material weakness in accordance with &#167;___.510, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.
</P></UL>

<P>
(d) <I>Compliance.</I>
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor shall determine whether the auditee has complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements that may have a direct and material effect on each of its major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan.
</P>

<P>
     (2) The principal compliance requirements common to most Federal programs and the programmatic compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplements.
</P>

<P>
     (3) For the compliance requirements (common and programmatic) related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplements, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplements, the auditor shall determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplements, the auditor should use the types of compliance requirements (e.g., cash management, Federal financial reporting, allowable costs/cost principles, types of services allowed or unallowed, eligibility, and matching) contained in the compliance supplements as guidance for identifying the types of compliance requirements to test, and determine the requirements governing the Federal program by reviewing the provisions of contracts and grant agreements and the laws and regulations referred to in such contracts and grant agreements. The auditor should consult with the applicable Federal agency to determine the availability of agency-prepared supplements or audit guides.
</P>

<P>
     (4) The compliance testing shall include tests of transactions, including costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan, and such other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor sufficient evidence to support an opinion on compliance.
</P></UL>

<P>
(e) <I>Audit follow-up.</I> The auditor shall follow-up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with &#167;___.315(b), and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding. The auditor shall perform audit follow-up procedures regardless of whether a prior audit finding relates to a major program or the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan in the current year.
</P>

<P>
(f) <I>Communication.</I> The auditor shall communicate, preferably in writing, to the auditee which Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities are required to receive a copy of the reporting package pursuant to &#167;___.320(d)(2) and &#167;___.320(e)(2), respectively. The auditor shall retain a record of this communication in the auditor's working papers.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.505 Audit reporting.
</B></P>

<P>
The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) shall state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:
</P>

<P>
(a) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.
</P>

<P>
(b) A report on internal control related to the financial statements, major programs, and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. This report shall describe the scope of testing of internal control and the results of the tests, and, where applicable, refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>

<P>
(c) A report on compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements. This report shall also include an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements which could have a direct and material effect on each major program and on the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan, and, where applicable, refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>

<P>
(d) A schedule of findings and questioned costs which shall include the following three components:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) A summary of the auditor's results which shall include: 
    
</P> 
<UL>
<P>
          (i) The type of report the auditor issued on the financial statements of the auditee (i.e., unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);
</P>

<P>
          (ii) Where applicable, a statement that reportable conditions in internal control were disclosed by the audit of the financial tatements and whether any such conditions were material weaknesses;
</P>

<P>
          (iii) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any noncompliance which is material to the financial statements of the auditee;
</P>

<P>
          (iv) Where applicable, a statement that reportable conditions in internal control over major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan were disclosed by the audit and whether any such conditions were material weaknesses;
</P>

<P>
          (v) The type of report the auditor issued on compliance for major programs and with the provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the FAR (48 CFR parts 30 and 31), or other applicable cost principles or regulations pertaining to the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan (i.e., unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion); and
</P>

<P>
          (vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any audit findings which the auditor is required to report under &#167;___.510(a).
</P></UL>

<P>
     (2) Findings and questioned costs for the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.
</P>

<P>
     (3) Findings and questioned costs for Federal awards which shall include audit findings as defined in &#167;___.510(a).
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) Audit findings (e.g., internal control findings, compliance findings, questioned costs, or fraud) which relate to the same issue should be presented as a single audit finding. Where practical, audit findings should be organized by Federal agency or pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
          (ii) Audit findings which relate to both the financial statements and Federal awards, as reported under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, respectively, should be reported in both schedules. However, the reporting in one schedule may be in summary form with a reference to a detailed reporting in the other schedule.
</P></UL></UL>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.510 Audit findings.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Audit findings reported.</I> The auditor shall report the following as audit findings in a schedule of findings and questioned costs:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Reportable conditions in internal control over major programs and over the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a  reportable condition for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program, total costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan, or an audit objective identified in the compliance supplements. The auditor shall identify reportable conditions which are individually or cumulatively material weaknesses.
</P>

<P>
     (2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements related to a major program and the provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the FAR, or other applicable cost principles or regulations pertaining to the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. The auditor's determination of whether a noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program, total costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan, or an audit objective identified in the compliance supplements.
</P>

<P>
     (3) Known questioned costs which are greater than $10,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program and costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. Known questioned costs are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the best estimate of total costs questioned (likely questioned costs), not just the questioned costs specifically identified (known questioned costs). The auditor shall also report known questioned costs when likely questioned costs are greater than $10,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program and costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan. In reporting questioned costs, the auditor shall include information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.
</P>

<P>
     (4) Known questioned costs which are greater than $10,000 for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required under this part to perform audit procedures for such a Federal program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program which is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program (e.g., as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $10,000, then the auditor shall report this as an audit finding.
</P>

<P>
     (5) The circumstances concerning why the auditor's report on compliance for major programs and the allowability of costs charged to cost pools used to support an indirect cost rate or allocated through a cost allocation plan is other than an unqualified opinion, unless such circumstances are otherwise reported as audit findings in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards.
</P>

<P>
     (6) Known fraud affecting a Federal award, unless such fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards. This paragraph does not require the auditor to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside of the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.
</P>

<P>
     (7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with &#167;___.315(b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.
</P></UL>

<P>
(b) <I>Audit finding detail.</I> Audit findings shall be presented in sufficient detail for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action and for Federal agencies and pass-through entities to arrive at a management decision. The following specific information shall be included, as applicable, in audit findings:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) Federal program and specific Federal award identification including the CFDA title and number, Federal award number and year, name of Federal agency, and name of the applicable pass-through entity. When information, such as the CFDA title and number or Federal award number, is not available, the auditor shall provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.
</P>

<P>
     (2) The criteria or specific requirement upon which the audit finding is based, including statutory, regulatory, or other citation.
</P>

<P>
     (3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.
</P>

<P>
     (4) Identification of questioned costs and how they were computed.
</P>

<P>
     (5) Information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the audit findings, such as whether the audit findings represent an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified shall be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value.
</P>

<P>
     (6) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action.
</P>

<P>
     (7) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.
</P>

<P>
     (8) Views of responsible officials of the auditee when there is disagreement with the audit findings, to the extent practical.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Reference numbers.</I> Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs shall include a reference number to allow for easy referencing of the audit findings during follow-up.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.515 Audit working papers.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>Retention of working papers.</I> The auditor shall retain working papers and reports for a minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee, unless the auditor is notified in writing by the cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, or pass-through entity to extend the retention period. When the auditor is aware that the Federal awarding agency, pass-through entity, or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor shall contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to destruction of the working papers and reports.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Access to working papers.</I> Audit working papers shall be made available upon request to the cognizant or oversight agency for audit or its designee, a Federal agency providing direct or indirect funding, or GAO at the completion of the audit. Access to working papers includes the right of Federal agencies to obtain copies of working papers, as is reasonable and necessary.
</P>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.520 Major program determination.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The auditor shall use a risk-based approach to determine which Federal programs are major programs. This risk-based approach shall include consideration of: Current and prior audit experience, oversight by Federal agencies and pass-through entities, and the inherent risk of the Federal program. The process in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section shall be followed.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Step 1.</I>
</P>

<UL><P>
     (1) The auditor shall identify the larger Federal programs, which shall be labeled Type A programs. Type A programs are defined as Federal programs with Federal awards expended during the audit period exceeding the larger of:
</P> 

<UL>
<P>
          (i) $300,000 or three percent (.03) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards expended equal or exceed $300,000 but are less than or equal to $100 million.
</P>

<P>
          (ii) $3 million or three-tenths of one percent (.003) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards expended exceed $100 million but are less than or equal to $10 billion.
</P>

<P>
          (iii) $30 million or 15 hundredths of one percent (.0015) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards expended exceed $10 billion.
</P></UL>

<P>
     (2) Federal programs not labeled Type A under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be labeled Type B programs.
</P>

<P>
     (3) The inclusion of large loan and loan guarantees (loans) should not result in the exclusion of other programs as Type A programs. When a Federal program providing loans significantly affects the number or size of Type A programs, the auditor shall consider this Federal program as a Type A program and exclude its values in determining other Type A programs.
</P>

<P>
     (4) For biennial audits permitted under &#167;___.220, the determination of Type A and Type B programs shall be based upon the Federal awards expended during the two-year period.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Step 2.</I>
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) The auditor shall identify Type A programs which are low-risk. For a Type A program to be considered low-risk, it shall have been audited as a major program in at least one of the two most recent audit periods (in the most recent audit period in the case of a biennial audit), and, in the most recent audit period, it shall have had no audit findings under &#167;___.510(a). However, the auditor may use judgment and consider that audit findings from questioned costs under &#167;___.510(a)(3) and &#167;___.510(a)(4), fraud under &#167;___.510(a)(6), and audit follow-up for the summary schedule of prior audit findings under &#167;___.510(a)(7) do not preclude the Type A program from being low-risk. The auditor shall consider: the criteria in &#167;___.525(c), &#167;___.525(d)(1), &#167;___.525(d)(2), and &#167;___.525(d)(3); the results of audit follow-up; whether any changes in personnel or systems affecting a Type A program have significantly increased risk; and apply professional judgment in determining whether a Type A program is low-risk.
</P>

<P>
     (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, OMB may approve a Federal awarding agency's request that a Type A program at certain recipients may not be considered low-risk. For example, it may be necessary for a large Type A program to be audited as major each year at particular recipients to allow the Federal agency to comply with the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (31 U.S.C. 3515). The Federal agency shall notify the recipient and, if known, the auditor at least 120 days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited of OMB's approval.
</P></UL>

<P>
(d) <I>Step 3.</I>
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) The auditor shall identify Type B programs which are high-risk using professional judgment and the criteria in &#167;___.525. However, should the auditor select Option 2 under Step 4 (paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section), the auditor is not required to identify more high-risk Type B programs than the number of low-risk Type A programs. Except for known reportable conditions in internal control or compliance problems as discussed in &#167;___.525(b)(1), &#167;___.525(b)(2), and &#167;___.525(c)(1), a single criteria in &#167;___.525 would seldom cause a Type B program to be considered high-risk.
</P>

<P>
     (2) An audit under this part is not expected to test relatively small Federal programs. Therefore, except to meet the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section, the auditor is only required to perform risk assessments on Type B programs that exceed the larger of:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
          (i) $100,000 or three-tenths of one percent (.003) of total Federal awards expended when the auditee has less than or equal to $100 million in total Federal awards expended.
</P>

<P>
          (ii) $300,000 or three-hundredths of one percent (.0003) of total Federal awards expended when the auditee has more than $100 million in total Federal awards expended.
</P></UL></UL>

<P>
(e) <I>Step 4.</I> At a minimum, the auditor shall audit all of the following as major programs:
</P>

<UL><P>
     (1) All Type A programs, except the auditor may exclude any Type A programs identified as low-risk under Step 2 (paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
</P>

<P>
          (2) (i) High-risk Type B programs as identified under either of the following two options:
</P>

<UL><UL><P>
               (A) <I>Option 1</I>. At least one half of the Type B programs identified as high-risk under Step 3 (paragraph (d) of this section), except this paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) does not require the auditor to audit more high-risk Type B programs than the number of low-risk Type A programs identified as low-risk under Step 2.
</P>

<P>
               (B) <I>Option 2</I>. One high-risk Type B program for each Type A program identified as low-risk under Step 2.
</P></UL>

<P>
          (ii) When identifying which high-risk Type B programs to audit as major under either Option 1 or 2 in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) or (B), the auditor is encouraged to use an approach which provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major over a period of time.
</P></UL>

<P>
     (3) Such additional programs as may be necessary to comply with the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. This paragraph (e)(3) may require the auditor to audit more programs as major than the number of Type A programs.
</P></UL>

<P>
(f) <I>Percentage of coverage rule.</I> The auditor shall audit as major programs Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, encompass at least 50 percent of total Federal awards expended. If the auditee meets the criteria in &#167;___.530 for a low-risk auditee, the auditor need only audit as major programs Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, encompass at least 25 percent of total Federal awards expended.
</P>

<P>
(g) <I>Documentation of risk.</I> The auditor shall document in the working papers the risk analysis process used in determining major programs.
</P>

<P>
(h) <I>Auditor's judgment.</I> When the major program determination was performed and documented in accordance with this part, the auditor's judgment in applying the risk-based approach to determine major programs shall be presumed correct. Challenges by Federal agencies and pass-through entities shall only be for clearly improper use of the guidance in this part. However, Federal agencies and pass-through entities may provide auditors guidance about the risk of a particular Federal program and the auditor shall consider this guidance in determining major programs in audits not yet completed.
</P>

<P>
(i) <I>Deviation from use of risk criteria.</I> For first-year audits, the auditor may elect to determine major programs as all Type A programs plus any Type B programs as necessary to meet the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. Under this option, the auditor would not be required to perform the procedures discussed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (1) A first-year audit is the first year the entity is audited under this part or the first year of a change of auditors.
</P>

<P>
     (2) To ensure that a frequent change of auditors would not preclude audit of high-risk Type B programs, this election for first-year audits may not be used by an auditee more than once in every three years.
</P></UL>

<P>
<B>&#167;___.525 Criteria for Federal program risk.</B>
</P>

<P>
(a) <I>General.</I> The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of noncompliance occurring which could be material to the Federal program. The auditor shall use auditor judgment and consider criteria, such as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular Federal program with auditee management and the Federal agency or pass-through entity.
</P>

<P>
(b) <I>Current and prior audit experience.</I> (1) Weaknesses in internal control over Federal programs would indicate higher risk. Consideration should be given to the control environment over Federal programs and such factors as the expectation of management's adherence to applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of contracts and grant agreements and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the Federal programs.
</P>

<UL><UL>
<P>
          (i) A Federal program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. When assessing risk in a large single audit, the auditor shall consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit (e.g., one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.
</P>

<P>
          (ii) When significant parts of a Federal program are passed through to subrecipients, a weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk.
</P>

<P>
          (iii) The extent to which computer processing is used to administer Federal programs, as well as the complexity of that processing, should be considered by the auditor in assessing risk. New and recently modified computer systems may also indicate risk.
</P></UL>

<P>
     (2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, particularly when the situations identified in the audit findings could have a significant impact on a Federal program or have not been corrected.
</P>

<P>
     (3) Federal programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than Federal programs recently audited as major programs without audit findings.
</P></UL>

<P>
(c) <I>Oversight exercised by Federal agencies and pass-through entities.</I> (1) Oversight exercised by Federal agencies or pass-through entities could indicate risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity which disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk. However, monitoring which disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (2) Federal agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, may identify Federal programs which are higher risk. OMB plans to provide this identification in the compliance supplements.
</P></UL>

<P>
(d) <I>Inherent risk of the Federal program.</I> (1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be of higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may have a high-risk for time and effort reporting, but otherwise be at low-risk.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
     (2) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, laws, regulations, or the provisions of contracts or grant agreements may increase risk.
</P>

<P>
     (3) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.
</P>

<P>
     (4) Type B programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.

<Title> Welfare Reform Creates New Assistance Block Grant</Title><P>

<h2> Welfare Reform Creates New Assistance Block Grant</h2>

<body>
<i>Food Stamps, Medicaid Remain Entitlements</i><P>

The new welfare reform bill (H.R. 3734), expected to be signed into law at press
time by President Clinton as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
Reconciliation Act of 1996, will dramatically change the welfare system and hand
states a greater amount of administrative control. Most provisions of the law
will take effect July 1, 1997.<P>

The act eliminates Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) as an
entitlement, replacing it with block grants to states known as Temporary
Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). The legislation generally gives states more
flexibility in designing programs and deciding eligibility requirements. <P>

However, states must meet minimum requirements for getting recipients into jobs
and have to report more information to the federal government than under current
welfare programs. TANF will be oriented toward performance by giving bonus grants
to states that exceed certain goals and reducing allocations for states failing
to meet specified requirements. States that are penalized through reduced funding
must replace those federal funds with states funds, in effect doubling the amount
of any penalty.<P>

Several proposed block grants were left out of the legislation. Some members of
Congress had wanted to create block grants for foster care and adoption
assistance, child and family services, Medicaid and food stamps. The new statute
makes some changes to these programs and consolidates several child care and
commodity assistance programs.<P>

<h3><i>Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)</i></h3><P>


Under the new TANF provisions, states will have to submit a plan outlining how
they would conduct the program to meet its goals, including getting recipients
into work. TANF funds can be used to: provide assistance to needy families; end
dependence on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work and
marriage; prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and encourage the formation and
maintenance of two-parent families.<P>

States also will be able to receive supplemental grants for work programs and
cash welfare payments. In the case of the latter, a state would qualify if its
average federal welfare spending per person was less than the national average
and its population growth exceeded the average of all the states.<P>

A contingency fund will be established to help states with rising welfare
caseloads. Eligible states could receive additional funds of up to 20 percent of
their annual TANF allotment. States could qualify if unemployment is higher than
in previous years or if food stamp participation has increased 10 percent. The
same rules for using regular TANF grant funds apply to the supplemental and
contingency funds.<P>

TANF funds can be spent on state-designed job training programs, and the use of
vouchers that allow recipients more choice in where to get employment services is
permissible. Not only do individuals receiving assistance have to meet certain
work requirements, but states are held more accountable for finding recipients
jobs. Under TANF, 50 percent of single-parent families receiving assistance must
be participating in work activities by 2002, and for two-parent families, 90
percent must be working by 1999. States failing to achieve these goals could be
penalized through a 5 percent to 21 percent reduction in their allotments.<P>

"Work activities" that count toward the minimum percentage is strictly defined.
For example, no more than 12 months of vocational education training can count as
a work activity. States must not displace existing workers when finding
recipients jobs and must have grievance procedures to resolve complaints from
workers who claim to have been displaced.<P>

The legislation sets relatively broad parameters for eligible uses of TANF funds.
States will be able to transfer up to 30 percent of their TANF allotment to the
Child Care and Development (CCDBG) or the Social Services block grant programs.
The new law also will allow states to provide family assistance services through
contracts with religious organizations "on the same basis as any other private
organization." Current regulations restrict the use of sectarian organizations in
such programs.<P>

Under TANF, states will have some discretion in establishing eligibility for
benefits but will have to comply with certain limitations on who can receive
assistance and for how long. The law establishes a lifetime limit on benefits of
five years, though states can have a shorter limit and give "hardship exemptions"
to 20 percent of families on their monthly caseload. <P>

States are prohibited from providing TANF assistance to certain populations.
These include most unmarried parents under age 18 who do not live with a parent
or other adult or who refuse to attend high school or an equivalent training
program. Legal immigrants are denied welfare benefits their first five years in
the United States; states can decide their eligibility after that time. The
so-called "family cap" requirement was dropped, though states have the option of
imposing a cap if they choose, which denies benefits for any new children born to
a family receiving TANF. States can also deny aid to those convicted of a drug
felony.<P>

While the welfare legislation imposes penalties on states that fail to meet its
requirements, the legislation offers financial incentives to states to achieve
the goals of welfare reform, such as reducing out-of-wedlock births, and will
reward "high performance" states with bonus grants of up to 5 percent of their
state family assistance grant. State performance will be measured through a
formula developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the
National Governors Association and the American Public Welfare Association.  <P>

<h3><i>Grant Administration, Reporting Requirements</i></h3><P>

Under TANF, states will be required to continue spending at least 75 percent of
their past state expenditures on specified welfare and social service programs.
States that fail to meet the work participation requirements will be required to
maintain 80 percent of their spending. In contrast, AFDC has no
maintenance-of-effort requirement; it matches state dollars at a designated rate
(between 50 percent and 83 percent). Although the law contains some restrictions
on what can count toward a state's maintenance-of-effort, it does permit states
to apply expenditures for families that are ineligible for federal benefits under
welfare reform -- including families that have exceeded their five-year benefit
limit.<P>

Also, administrative costs for states under TANF are capped at 15 percent.
Because the legislation requires states to collect, track and analyze much more
data about assistance recipients, many states will need to expand their computer
systems or purchase new systems. Therefore, "information technology and
computerization" related to TANF requirements will not count toward the 15
percent cap. However, administrative costs that states count toward their
maintenance-of-effort are subject to that limit.<P>

Under the new reporting requirements, states must collect data on each family
receiving assistance and report to HHS on a quarterly basis. That information,
which can be reported through a scientifically acceptable sampling method
approved by HHS, must include such factors as:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the number of family members and each member's relationship to the youngest
child;<P>
<LI>the race and educational status" and "citizenship" of each adult and child;
and<P>
<LI>the number of hours per week that adults participate in education,
employment, job search, job training and other activities.<P>
</UL>

States must also report on the percentage of TANF funds they used for
administrative purposes; the total amount expended on programs that quarter; the
number of noncustodial parents in work activities; and the amount spent on
transitional services for families moving from welfare to work. States failing to
submit required reports would have their grants reduced by 4 percent. <P>

States that have received waivers to experiment under AFDC (as approved by HHS
under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act) will be allowed to continue
administering welfare programs according to the terms of the waivers until they
expire. Those terms will take precedence over any provisions in the welfare law
that are inconsistent with the waiver, but states will receive block grant
allotments in place of other payments provided for in the waiver. If a state
submitted a waiver request before the enactment of the legislation, the waiver
can still be approved by HHS on or before July 1, 1997. <P>

<h3><i>Expanded CCDBG</i></h3><P>

The title IV-A AFDC Child Care, Transitional Child Care and At-Risk Child Care
programs are folded into the CCDBG program under the new welfare law. States will
receive a single child care block grant to provide assistance to low-income
families. <P>

Under the new CCDBG program, states are subject to a 5 percent cap on
administrative costs, but the conference report on the welfare reform legislation
lists numerous exceptions to what counts toward that cap. For example,
eligibility determinations, participation in judicial hearings, recruitment and
inspections of child care placements, and maintenance of computerized child care
information "are an integral part of service delivery and should not be
considered administrative costs."<P>

The legislation removes the current requirement that states spend 25 percent of
CCDBG funds for activities that improve the quality and increase the availability
of child care. However, a new set-aside is created: states will be required to
use at least 4 percent of all funds for "comprehensive consumer education" for
parents. As under TANF, states must report quarterly to HHS on each family
receiving assistance. In addition, states must report twice a year on other
program information, including "the manner in which consumer education
information was provided and the number of parents who received it."<P>

<h3><i>Child Support Enforcement</i></h3><P>

The new statute broadens states' obligations for enforcing child support payments
and tracking parents who owe child support. The enhanced federal matching rate of
90 percent for automated data systems will decrease to 80 percent for fiscal
years 1996 through 2001. No performance-based system for funding is established,
but the legislation requires HHS to develop a proposal that would give states
"incentive payments."<P>

By Oct. 1, 1997, states must operate a "directory of new hires." Employers and
labor organizations must report to the state the name, address and social
security number of each newly hired employee. The state child support agency is
expected to use the information to help establish paternity for TANF and other
assistance programs, and to locate individuals who owe child support.<P>

A 5-percent reduction in TANF funding will be the penalty for states failing to
comply with the child support and paternity enforcement provisions. States can
reduce benefits to individuals who refuse to cooperate with states in
establishing paternity.<P>

<h3><i>Other Assistance Programs Affected</i></h3><P>

The Food Stamp Program was not turned into a block grant, as proposed, but
various eligibility and income determination provisions were revised. For
example, childless adults aged 18-50 will be eligible to receive food stamps for
three months in any three-year period. If those recipients become unemployed,
they may apply for three more months of benefits. States are given greater
latitude in implementing employment and job training requirements for food stamp
recipients. The legislation broadens the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
authority to waive food stamp requirements. <P>

In a major administrative change, the new law requires states to implement
electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems for the Food Stamp Program within six
years. Under EBT, it is envisioned that food stamp recipients will be issued
debit cards that will be used to electronically deduct benefit allotments as food
is purchased in stores. USDA can waive the deadline if a state "faces unusual
barriers" to implementing EBT.<P>

Previously, states had been encouraged but not required to implement EBT. States
have been wary, however, because the Federal Reserve Board has ruled that states
are subject to "Regulation E," which limits cardholder liability if cards are
lost or stolen and in turn could increase state costs. However, the new law
provides that Regulation E will not apply to any EBT system administered by state
or local governments distributing means-tested benefits. <P>

Other food assistance programs will undergo changes. Reimbursement levels are
lowered for meals provided under the Summer Food Service Program for Children and
Child Care Food Program. The legislation also melds soup kitchen and food bank
commodities programs into the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP).
Technical changes are made to the school lunch and breakfast programs.<P>

Medicaid coverage will continue as an entitlement, rather than the block grant
proposed earlier this year. Individuals who stop receiving TANF benefits and go
to work will continue to be covered by Medicaid for one year.<P>

Congress also had proposed turning disability assistance for children under the
Supplemental Security Income Program into a block grant, but that idea was not
adopted. However, the legislation tightens the definition of "disability" for
purposes of determining eligibility for individuals under age 18. The revised
definition includes impairments leading to "marked and severe functional
limitations and which can be expected to result in death or last at least a
continuous period of not less than 12 months."<P>

The new law makes several changes to the eligibility of legal immigrants for
receiving various benefits. Under some programs, such as the Food Stamp Program,
non-citizens legally in the United States are generally ineligible. Under other
programs, such as TANF, Medicaid and title XX (the Social Services Block Grant
Program), states have the option of prohibiting legal immigrants from receiving
benefits. The legislation provides exceptions for emergency assistance.

<html> <title> Secondary Payer's Discounted  Rate Accepted as Full
Payment</title>

<P>
<h2> Secondary Payer's Discounted  Rate Accepted as Full Payment</h2>
<body>
<P>

<b><i>Provider Can't Later Bill Primary Payer for Regular Rate, Appeals Court
Rules</b></i><P>

A primary insurer that might have paid a hospital bill at an undiscounted cost of
$654,227 was not required to pay the hospital at all because the secondary
insurer paid the bill first, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has found.
Because the hospital unconditionally accepted the secondary insurer's discounted
amount of $177,219 as payment in full on behalf of the participant, the
participant was no longer legally obligated to pay further medical expenses, and
had no further right to claim indemnification from the primary insurer. As
assignee of the participant's right to payment from the primary plan, the
hospital in the case, <i>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center v. Massachusetts Mutual Life
Ins. Co.</i>, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 27693 (9th Cir. Sept. 21, 1995), stood in no
better position than the participant, and was similarly not entitled to any
further payment from the primary insurer. <P>

<h3>Facts of the Case</h3><P>

John Gambardella obtained dependent coverage through his employer plan, insured
by MassMutual. The terms of the plan required medical care to be provided by a
member of MassMutual's  exclusive provider network except in an emergency, in
which case notification to a network member was required within 48 hours. John's
wife Jane was pregnant when the coverage became effective, and the coverage
extended to medical expenses of the newborn as a dependent from the moment of
birth.<P>

Jane's health coverage, provided to her employer by CIGNA, included coverage for
both her pregnancy and care of the newborn. Under Jane's plan, she was required
to receive medical care from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Cedars did not
participate in the MassMutual plan.<P>

Both plans contained a coordination of benefits provision that incorporated the
birthday rule to determine which insurer would be primarily responsible for
medical costs incurred by the newborn. Because John's birthday fell first in the
year, MassMutual was the primary insurer. <P>

Jane gave birth prematurely at Cedars. Upon Jane's admission, John assigned to
Cedars all the medical insurance benefits that would otherwise be payable to him.
The newborn remained hospitalized at Cedars for five months, but John did not
provide the notification required by MassMutual until after the baby was released
from the hospital.<P>

Cedars sought payment of $654,227 from MassMutual for medical expenses incurred
by the baby. MassMutual denied the claim because no notice was provided within 48
hours. Cedars then accepted CIGNA's payment of $177,219 as full payment for the
baby's medical expenses pursuant to a previously negotiated discount rate. Cedars
agreed that this payment discharged the Gambardellas' debt to Cedars.<P>

Cedars subsequently attempted to collect payment from MassMutual, contending that
as the baby's primary insurer, MassMutual was obligated to pay for her care at an
undiscounted rate of $654,227.<P>

<h3>Assignee "Stands in the Shoes" of the Insured, Appeals Court Determines</h3><P>

The district court in California found that John's failure to comply with the
48-hour notice requirement did not prejudice MassMutual, and that under
California law, the claim should not have been denied on that basis. However, the
court found that the Gambardellas' debt to Cedars had been fully discharged by
CIGNA's payment, and because there was no further indebtedness, Cedars, as John's
assignee, could not recover any additional payment. <P>

The 9th Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling that MassMutual was not
responsible for any further payment to Cedars. According to the court, Cedars had
no legitimate claim against MassMutual because Cedars, as John's assignee, merely
"stands in the shoes" of John, (that is, takes his place) with respect to
recovery of insurance proceeds, and CIGNA's payment had discharged John's debt in
full. Because John did not legally owe any further payment to Cedars, John was
not entitled to claim further recovery from MassMutual; consequently, Cedars had
no further right of recovery. <P>

Finding that MassMutual did not owe Cedars any further payment, the 9th Circuit
did not consider MassMutual's argument that the district court erred in applying
the state law regarding prejudice.<P>

It is interesting that Cedars forfeited its right to claim the undiscounted rate
of payment despite its initial application to MassMutual for payment of medical
expenses which, it could be argued, were denied improperly. Note that the case
involved the claim of Cedars against MassMutual and did not discuss the
settlement of the primary versus secondary issue between the two private
insurers. <P>

The 9th Circuit includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana,
Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Guam. <P>

<TITLE>Adding Value to Your Benefits Program Through Flexibility</TITLE>

<h2>Adding Value to Your Benefits Program Through Flexibility</h2>

<P>
<B><I>By Richard D. Quinn, Contributing Editor<BR>
President, Personnel Research Associates</I></B>
</P>

<P>
For many benefit professionals, the first question asked in plan design is: "Is it legal?" Legal compliance is essential. However, the driving force in plan design should be choice and flexibility.
</P>

<P>
Choice comes in many forms. Health benefits may offer HMOs and/or indemnity plans with varying deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. Cafeteria plans offer many options, including life insurance and disability coverage. Progressive employers allow employees the choice of non-traditional benefits such as group legal, group auto and universal life insurance.  
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>The 401(k) Plan--The Ultimate in Choice </H3>
</P>

<P>
But even with all these options, the most critical choice for employees is retirement income. With the decline in defined benefit plans, the uncertain future of Social Security and the increasing age limit for full retirement benefits, employees' reliance on retirement planning is even more crucial.
</P>

<P>
As the trend continues to move toward 401(k) defined contribution plans, many employers still design their plans primarily to pass the tax code's discrimination tests. As a result, employers tend to constrain employee contribution choices--allowing only pre-tax contributions and restricting changes to once each month or quarter. In addition, many plans severely limit withdrawals, do not permit loans, restrict fund allocation among available investments and otherwise force employees into plans that are very limited, have little flexibility and fail to accommodate life events that occur prior to retirement.
</P>

<P>
Between the start of a career and retirement, most people will marry, purchase a home and send their children to college. They may also face unforeseen financial emergencies. Conventional wisdom says that 401(k) plans should be for retirement only, and other methods should be used to save for such events. However, most Americans lack the discipline to save for long-term goals. 
</P>

<P>
The best way most people save money is through payroll deduction. Therefore, rather than restricting 401(k) plans to retirement savings only--making it more difficult to squirrel away funds for a home and college education--why encourage all types of savings within a qualified retirement plan?  
</P>

<P>
This might raise participation and savings rates, and generate good will within the work force. When employees have little access to their funds and are slapped with tax penalties for making an emergency withdrawal, they are inclined to save only the smallest amount they can spare. However, if employees have more flexibility to manage these funds, they are more likely to maximize their savings.
</P>

<P>
It is possible to design such a plan in today's environment. Following is an outline of a user-friendly thrift plan which has been in place since 1981 and has never failed a discrimination test. 
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Contributions--both pre-tax and after-tax--are permitted in any combination up to 25 percent of pay (limited to the current 401(k) contribution cap). Employees can send in "make-up" contributions by check at any time during the plan year.
</P>
<P>
	<LI>The employer matches 50 percent of employee contributions up to 6 percent of salary, on a pre-tax and/or after-tax basis.
</P>
<P>
	<LI>Employees are eligible to contribute immediately upon hire; the company match begins after six months. Rollover contributions are accepted, and employees can allocate rollovers into eight funds.  
</P>
<P>
	<LI>There is daily valuation of accounts. Employees can make investment changes and other transactions and request a complete account statement on a daily basis through a telephone voice response system. Paper forms have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
	<LI>Two loans--each allowing up to 60 months to repay--are permitted at one time. Employees can model loan payments by length of a loan or by the monthly payment amount through the voice response system. Employees may also write checks to make extra principal payments on an outstanding loan.
</P>
<P>
	<LI>Hardship withdrawals are permitted for all allowable reasons under the IRS safe harbor rules. 
</P>
<P>
	<LI>In-service withdrawals are permitted at any time. Employees who have after-tax money in the plan can determine how much of a total distribution is required to receive a specified amount on an after-tax basis. They can then elect a rollover for the taxable portion and receive a check for the balance. This avoids a taxable distribution, avoids the need for a hardship withdrawal and minimizes the total withdrawal amount. However, company contributions can be suspended if money is withdrawn too soon after the employee places it in the plan--this is an IRS rule you can't avoid.
</P>
<P>
	<LI>Investment allocations and transfers among funds can be made in 1-percent increments.
</P>
</UL>

<P>
Sound attractive? That's the whole idea. This plan is consistent with a total flexible benefits strategy, in which employee choice and flexibility are the name of the game. The plan is in full IRS compliance, but IRS rules did not drive the plan design. Rather, someone came up with an idea and everything possible was done to implement it <I>and</I> comply with the regulations.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Fitting Into an Overall Strategy</H3>
</P>

<P>
A defined contribution plan is not an isolated tool to be used for retirement income only. Rather, it lends itself to other uses. 
</P>

<P>
For example, if an employer seeks to reduce or eliminate its obligation for retiree medical benefits, allowing employees to fund such an obligation over a longer period of time is essential, especially with today's trend toward mid-career hiring. First, employers can provide group medical benefits to assure the availability of such coverage. Second, they can provide vehicles--such as a thrift plan or a 501(c)(9) trust with or without employer contributions--in which employees can accumulate funds to pay health premiums. One employer has established a retiree health account in which employees can place money on an after-tax basis. The earnings accumulate and can be used tax-free for eligible medical expenses. Contributions can be as low as $5 per week. In the future, the employer will place $75 per year into the account once an employee attains 25 years of service.  
</P>

<P>
Retirees can also have more flexibility in retiree benefits if employers offer a choice of options such as multiple indemnity plans, HMOs and PPOs. Retirees who contribute to such coverage can assume more responsibility by enrolling in a higher deductible plan if they are ineligible for or do not want a managed care option. This also helps hold the employer's costs down.  
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>A "Total Benefit Needs" Approach</H3>
</P>

<P>
401(k) plans and other employee benefit programs must be considered within an overall benefits strategy that reflects the needs of both employees and the employer. This is not as difficult as it may sound. The basis for such a strategy is understanding four things: (1) the available resources that can provide employee benefits; (2) employees' goals and concerns; (3) any likely future changes; and (4) the nature of the work force. For example, a long-term stable work force from which most people retire is vastly different than a work force from which employees will not retire or will retire with relatively few years of service. 
</P>

<P>
Today, the realities of the global marketplace affect workers at all levels. Stability is an extinct concept--individual responsibility and accountability are today's buzzwords. But for the average employee, the reality of those words in terms of financial security--where survival now depends on  adequate savings and prudent choices--are not fully understood. Benefit plan design can provide an invaluable service to the work force of the future by helping employees make the decisions necessary for lifelong financial security. Employers that offer such benefits will ultimately have an edge in attracting the best employees. But to seize this opportunity, employers must look beyond the question, "how do I comply with the law?" and begin asking themselves, "how can a design a benefits program that can be a valuable tool in employee recruiting and retention?"

<Title> Property Owners Near Leaking USTs Sue Marketers in Nationwide Class Action Suit</Title>
</head>

<body background="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">
<IMG SRC = "/tpg/enviro/ustt/ustthead.gif" alt="Underground Storage Tank Guide"><P>


<h2>Property Owners Near Leaking USTs Sue Marketers in Nationwide Class Action Suit</h2><P>

Acting with unprecedented speed, an Alabama county judge May 8 certified a nationwide class of people who own property near leaking underground storage tanks (USTs) one day after plaintiffs filed a lawsuit seeking damages for property devaluation caused by the alleged "willful and outrageous" conduct of many of the nation's oil companies (<I>Peters v. Brants Grocery</I>, No. CV-96-29 (Ala.
Cir. Ct. Coosa Cnty.)). <p>

The 48-page complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages for common law claims of negligence, nuisance, trespass and fraud. According to plaintiffs' class counsel Kenneth Ingram Jr., potential liability likely will be in the tens of billions of dollars. "Plaintiffs will prove that this widespread environmental calamity need never have happened. The oil company defendants were well aware more than thirty years ago of this problem and largely chose to ignore or conceal, or minimize it until forced to respond," the 
complaint states. <p>

Defendants in the case include the major oil producers Amoco Oil Co., British Petroleum Exploration &amp; Oil Inc., Chevron USA Inc., Exxon Corp., Shell Oil Co. and Texaco Refining and Marketing Inc. <p>

The suit alleges that defendants who upgraded selected facilities by replacing old UST systems took the action "more for economic, marketing and public relations objectives than for environmental protection" and left to leak many tank systems that needed repair. In addition, it alleges that defendants failed to investigate contamination or to warn adjacent property owners.<p>

Petroleum-marketer attorney Jeffrey Leiter of Collier, Shannon, Rill and Scott said the plaintiffs likely will have a problem proving that leaking tanks have caused a diminution in their property value. State trust fund and insurance data indicate that most tank leaks do not spread to adjacent properties, he said. <p>

Judge John Rochester approved the class, saying a class action is "the fairest

and most efficient means" of adjudicating the case. The class includes U.S.

property owners who have had or will have their properties "affected by soil,

sediments, groundwater and/or surface water contamination from a site containing

an underground storage tank system," according to the four-page certification

order. Specifically, 10 percent or more of the property must be located within

250 feet of a former retail petroleum-marketing facility where a leak was

reported in the last three years, the order states.<p>

The case qualified as a class action because it would be impracticable to join a

large number of separate plaintiffs in a single lawsuit; there is a well-defined

common interest among the parties in the questions of law and fact; and the

plaintiff will adequately protect the interests of the class, the order states.

Leiter said he is investigating the validity of the order. <p>

Property owners who meet the definition of the class are considered to be class

members unless they remove themselves by filing an opt-out notice with the court.

Thus, settling this case would give oil companies an opportunity to resolve much

of their future liability, but it is not clear for how long, Leiter said. Also,

it may be less expensive to defend this lawsuit and handle future claims

individually, he said. <p>

Personal injury and existing claims are excluded from the class, according to the

order. Also excluded are claims by government agencies or entities, such as state

or local highway departments; common carriers, such as railroads; easement

holders, such as utilities or pipeline companies; oil companies; defendants; and

U.S. or Alabama justices, judges and magistrate judges.<p>

The order requires defendants to "search their records and provide the

plaintiffs' attorneys with a list ... of all potential members of the plaintiff

class and their addresses" within 30 or 45 days, depending on applicable state

law. <p>

Other defendants named in the action are Brants Grocery, Conoco Oil &amp; Gas

Associates, CTE Environmental Inc., Ecology and Environment Inc., Eutaw Bait

Shop, Hamilton Texaco Service Station, Mapco Petroleum Inc., Star Enterprises and

Tenneco Inc. The suit does not name all of the nation's oil producers, but the

complaint may be amended after discovery to add additional companies, Ingram

said.<p>

Ingram is with the law firm of Morris, Haynes, Ingram &amp; Hornsby in Alexander

City, Ala. Also representing the plaintiffs are Joe Whatley Jr. and Peter Burke

of Cooper, Mitch, Crawford, Kuykendall &amp; Whatley in Birmingham, Ala.

<html> <title>Cafeteria Plans With Cash Opt-Out Provisions May Violate Medicare
Secondary Payer Law</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/pen_ben/flex/flexhead.gif" alt="Flex Plan 
Handbook"></center>
<P>
<h2> Cafeteria Plans With Cash Opt-Out Provisions May Violate Medicare Secondary
Payer
Law</h2>
<body>

A recent technical correction to the Medicare secondary payer law may affect
cafeteria plans that provide employees with cash if they waive medical coverage.
<P>

The Medicare law contains a provision which states that an employer cannot offer
financial incentives to employees over age 65 to waive coverage under the
employer's plan in favor of Medicare. The intent of the law is to discourage
employers from giving cash to employees over age 65 in order to shift costs to
Medicare. If this rule is violated, the Health Care Financing Administration
(HCFA) can levy fines of $5,000 per occurrence.<P>

The original version of the Medicare law provided that a financial incentive was
permissible, <i>provided it was offered to all employees who were covered under
the
plan</i>. In other words, under the prior version of the law, a cafeteria plan
which
provided cash to employees who waive coverage was permissible, provided all
employees were provided with the cash option (not just those over age 65).<P>

Unfortunately, amendments to the Social Security law which were enacted in 1994
changed the wording of the law by dropping the phrase, <i>"unless the incentive
is
offered to all employees who were covered under the plan."</i> In other words,
based
on the current wording of the law, offering a cash opt-out to employees over age
65 would violate the law, even if the opt-out is offered to all other employees.
<P>

The change in the law raises some concerns for cafeteria plan sponsors that offer
cash to employees who waive coverage. The conservative approach would be to not
offer the cash option to active employees over age 65. However, by doing so, an
employer could violate the nondiscrimination rules that apply to cafeteria plans,
depending on the composition of the over-age-65 employee group. As a practical
matter, HCFA is not currently enforcing this issue, and has announced no
immediate plans to do so.<P>

<html><title>Final IRS Regulations Clarify Deductions for Reimbursement and
Expense Allowances</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/pen_ben/perk/perkhead.gif" alt=" Employer's Guide to 
Fringe Benefit Rules"></center>
<P>
<h2> Final IRS Regulations Clarify Deductions for Reimbursement and Expense
Allowances</h2>
<body>

<b><i>No Significant Differences From Proposed Regulations</i></b><P>

The IRS has issued final regulations clarifying deductions for employer-provided
club dues, spousal travel and business meal and entertainment expenses.<P>

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 enacted a 100-percent deduction
disallowance for employer-provided club dues and for spousal travel and increased
the deduction disallowance for business meal and entertainment expenses from 20
percent to 50 percent. The final regulations guide employers in applying these
statutory changes to their fringe benefits policies.<P>

The final regulations became effective when they were published in the May 30
<i>Federal Register</i> (61 <i>Fed. Reg.</i> 27005). They do not differ significantly from the
proposed regulations, but include additional information that should help
benefits administrators apply the deductions correctly.<P>

<h3>Choice Allowed Between Exclusion and Deduction</h3><P>

Employers can choose how to treat expenses for employees' business use of clubs
or spousal travel. If an employer provides either of these two fringe benefits
for a bona fide business purpose, the employee can exclude the benefit from gross
income as a Code Section 132 working condition fringe benefit. (See Tab 400 of
the <i>Guide</i> for a discussion of working condition fringes.) If the employee is
allowed to exclude the benefit, the employer cannot also deduct the benefit as an
otherwise "ordinary and necessary" business expense.<P>

The employer can deduct the benefit's cost as a compensation expense if it treats
the value of the club's business use or spousal travel as compensation, and
includes that amount in the employee's income.<P>

Independent contractors and tax-exempt organizations also can choose between
excluding or deducting these two fringe benefits.<P>

<h3>No Usage Threshold for Club Dues</h3><P>

Employees must be taxed only on their personal use of clubs, even if their
personal use is more than their business use. Previously, an employee was taxed
on 100 percent of the club's use if that use was primarily personal.<P>

The rules for taxing a club's personal use do not affect an employer's choice
between excluding or deducting the club's business use.  (See &#182;410 of the
<i>Guide</i>.)<P>

<h3>Other Individual Defined</h3><P>

The proposed regulations directed that the spousal travel rules apply to spouses,
dependents and "other individuals." The final regulations clarify that "other
individuals" do not include business associates traveling with an employee, such
as customers, clients, suppliers, other employees, agents, partners or
professional advisors. (See &#182;420 of the <i>Guide</i>.)<P>

<h3>Get It Right the First Time</h3><P>

An employer's option to deduct or exclude a fringe benefit expense is attractive.
But in either situation, the club dues or spousal travel expense must be for bona
fide business purposes. The final regulations emphasize that a benefit must be
treated correctly on all tax forms when they are filed. If the employer treats
the benefit as compensation, taxes must be withheld.<P>

If the IRS decides during an audit that an employee's club use or spousal travel
was not for a bona fide business purpose, the benefit would be included in the
employee's gross income as compensation and would be subject to payroll
withholding and income taxes.<P>

If the IRS is auditing the employer, the employer will be liable for any
additional taxes on the employee's benefit and for any penalties. In addition,
the IRS will not permit the employer to deduct the recharacterized compensation.
Once an employer forgoes a deduction, it cannot file a refund claim to get it
back.<P>

<h3>Errors Could Trigger Nonaccountable Plan Penalties</h3><P>

The final regulations confirm that the IRS will not consider an employer's
reimbursement plan "nonaccountable" merely because an employer reimburses an
employee for nondeductible club dues or spousal travel. This provision, however,
does not apply if the spousal travel benefit is for a purpose other than bona
fide business.<P>

Under the Code Section 62 accountable plan rules, an employee must return any
advance that isn't used for substantiated business expenses. Not returning the
excess jeopardizes the arrangement's accountable status and could make all
benefits provided under the plan taxable -- even reimbursements for
business-related expenses. (See &#182;741-&#182;743 of the <i>Guide</i> for a discussion
of the accountable plan rules.)<P>

Here's an example of a penalty: Using a $700 travel advance, an employee buys two
$200 airline tickets for business travel, one for herself and one for her
husband. She also spends and substantiates $300 for business meals. If her
husband traveled with her for a bona fide business purpose, she then spent the
entire $700 on bona fide business expenses. But if her husband didn't travel for
that purpose, his $200 ticket would become an excess advance that the employee
failed to return. This failure would trigger the nonaccountable plan penalties
and the employee would be taxed on the entire $700 advance, not on just her
husband's $200 ticket.<P>

<h3>Unchanged Expenses</h3><P>

The IRS didn't modify the proposed regulations for business meal and
entertainment expenses. Employees may continue to exclude 100 percent of their
business meal and entertainment expenses from income. Employers, however, may
deduct only 50 percent of these expenses as "ordinary and necessary" business
expenses. <P>

<h3>Guidance Missing on Other Deductions</h3><P>

Although the final regulations reassure employees that they will not necessarily
be taxed on the nondeductible 50 percent of their business meal and entertainment
expenses or on any business-related club dues or spousal travel expenses, the
final regulations do not provide similar reassurances for eight other Code
Section 274 deduction limitations. Employees could be taxed on these fringe
benefits even if they substantiate their business expenses. The deduction
limitations cover gifts, foreign travel, tickets to sporting events, sky boxes,
non-North American conventions and cruises, lavish meals, educational travel and
luxury water transportation. (See &#182;400, &#182;701 and &#182;720 of the <i>Guide</i>
for a discussion of these deduction limitations.)<P>

On-premises athletic clubs might or might not be excludable as a fringe benefit.
The final regulations don't confirm whether this benefit is affected.<P>

<h3>Valuation Issues Remain Ambiguous</h3><P>

The final regulations do not offer guidelines for determining the disallowed
deduction amount for club dues or spousal travel when the costs of those benefits
differ from their "deemed" value, as is often the case with flights on company
planes. Other regulations permit an employer to deduct the cost of a company
flight for an employee's personal use, even though the flight's Standard Industry
Fare Level value is significantly less than the employer's actual cost. But the
regulations do not address what deduction the employer should record if there are
no additional expenses for providing a spousal travel benefit or if the
employer's incremental costs are zero, such as when both employee and spouse
travel on the company plane or when both stay in a double-occupancy hotel room.

<h2> Student with heart condition lawfully barred from playing college ball, 7th
Circuit rules<P></h2>
A permanent injunction ordering Northwestern University to allow a
student-athlete with a heart condition to play college ball has been vacated by
the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.<P>
Nicholas Knapp's heart stopped after a game in his high school gym in the fall of
1994. After being hospitalized, Knapp resumed playing basketball for his high
school team. When he signed an athletic scholarship to play basketball for
Northwestern University, Northwestern knew of his heart condition. <P>
However, after Knapp enrolled, the team physician determined he was not medically
eligible to participate in intercollegiate basketball. Knapp continued to receive
his scholarship and was kept on the team, but was barred from practicing or
competing.<P>
Knapp sued, claiming that Northwestern violated section 504. The U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois agreed and ordered Northwestern to
let Knapp play collegiate basketball (November 1996 Monthly Bulletin, p. 4). <P>
The 7th Circuit reversed, determining that Knapp was not substantially limited in
a major life activity and not qualified to play college ball. Barring Knapp from
playing intercollegiate basketball does not substantially limit him in the major
life activity of learning, the appellate court held.<P>
"Numerous college students graduate each year having neither participated in nor
attended an intercollegiate sporting event. ... Not playing intercollegiate
sports does not mean they have not learned. Playing or enjoying intercollegiate
sports therefore cannot be held out as a necessary part of learning for all
students," the 7th Circuit stated.<P>
Knapp was not qualified to play intercollegiate basketball because Northwestern
rationally determined that, if he competed, there was a reasonable probability of
his personal physical injury (possibly even death), the appellate court also
determined. <P>
"In regard to cases involving risk of future injury, a school's perception of the
threat of such injury cannot be based on unfounded fears or stereotypes; it must
be based on objective evidence. ... But here, where Northwestern acted rationally
and reasonably rather than paternalistically, no Rehabilitation Act violation has
occurred," the 7th Circuit said.<P>
This case is <i>Knapp v. Northwestern University,</i> Appendix IV:614.

<H2>No-exposure Incentive May Be Part of Future Stormwater Rules</H2>

<body>Members of the Urban Wet Weather Flows federal advisory committee last month
reviewed a draft "no-exposure" incentive provision that will likely be part of
future stormwater regulations.<P>

The proposal reflects a consensus on the part of committee members to include a
no-exposure provision as an alternative to obtaining an industrial stormwater
permit. But it also indicates that committee members are not yet in agreement on
how to handle the issue of impermeable surfaces exposed to stormwater.<P>

The draft no-exposure provision was developed by Peter Lehner of the National
Resources Defense Council, attorney Jeff Longsworth of the Washington law firm
of Collier, Shannon, Rill &amp; Scott, Roger Platt, deputy counsel of the Realty
Committee and Gary Stephany of the Department of Environmental Health in San
Diego.<P>

The provision would allow industrial facilities that are required to obtain
permits under phase I of the existing stormwater program to opt out of the
permitting requirement by meeting certain conditions. Under the draft proposal,
an industrial facility could avoid obtaining a permit by certifying that all its
industrial materials or activities are kept within a permanent enclosed
structure so that they are not exposed to rain, snow, snowmelt or runoff. The
provision would apply to material handling equipment, industrial machinery,
pipes, raw materials, intermediate products, by-products and waste products.<P>

"The intent of this provision is to provide a simplified method of complying
with section 402(p) for facilities which are entirely indoors," such as those
located within a larger office building, according to a memo submitted to the
committee by the no-exposure workgroup. A facility at which the only items
permanently exposed to precipitation are roofs, parking lots and vegetative
areas also would be eligible for the provision, the memo explained.<P>

The term "permanent enclosed" could include structures with a top cover but no
side coverings, provided that the materials protected beneath the structure are
also protected from stormwater run-on, the memo said.<P>

As proposed, the no-exposure provision would allow mobile equipment to be
exposed to precipitation or runoff while in use. "It is understood that certain
machinery, such as trucks, may pass between buildings and during passage be
exposed to rain. Such activities would not prevent a facility from taking
advantage," of the provision, the proposal states. States would be in charge of
determining the specific circumstances under which temporary structures meet the
requirement. Unless a state determined otherwise, temporary exposure to rainfall
or runoff would be allowed while a facility is being renovated, as long as a
temporary cover is provided, the proposal states. <P>

Industrial facilities seeking no-exposure certification in lieu of permits would
be required to submit to EPA or other permitting authority a sworn certification
from the plant manager that the facility meets all of the no-exposure
requirements. A facility certifying to no-exposure would have to:<P>

<UL><LI>re-certify every three years that it continues to meet the
requirements;<P>

<LI>seek a permit within 30 days after ceasing to be eligible for the
certification alternative; and<P>

<LI>allow the permitting authority or municipality to inspect the facility and
to make inspection reports available to the public.<P></UL>

The purpose of a certification alternative would be to reduce the regulatory
burden on both industry and government agencies, the proposal notes. However, it
would be necessary for permitting authorities to institute an inspection program
of some sort to ensure that facilities that take advantage of the no-exposure
provision meet all the requirements. <P>

Finally, facilities that are contributing to a violation of water quality
standards would be required to apply for an individual or general permit, the
proposal said.<P>

A March 8 memo from the no-exposure workgroup noted that the committee has not
reached agreement on how to address impacts from impermeable surfaces, such as
parking lots, roads and sidewalks, which are found at virtually all types of
facilities. Impermeable surfaces are known to increase flow velocity, which can
be a contributor to environmental degradation. Some committee members have
stated that including a no-exposure alternative to permits could result in a
failure to address runoff from impermeable surfaces.<P>

"While [no-exposure] may provide efficiencies for EPA and an added incentive to
act in a manner viewed as positive--i.e., covering industrial materials--it
would implicitly deem acceptable certain impacts that could, in predictable
circumstances, have adverse environmental consequences," the memo says in
summarizing the views of some committee members.<P>

Others say that if facilities that qualify for the no-exposure provision still
must implement structural controls to control runoff from impermeable surfaces,
they will "in practice be punished rather than rewarded for enclosing industrial
activities," the memo states. "It was further argued that such added regulatory
burdens would be particularly inequitable, if they were burdens that were not
shared equally by the whole range of dischargers whose impermeable surface may
increase flow velocity," the memo states.<P>

It was agreed during the March committee meeting that a separate workgroup
should be formed to address problems stemming from water flow and velocity. The
no-exposure workgroup will present a revised no-exposure proposal to the
committee in April. EPA has said it expects to include a no-exposure provision
in regulatory amendments to phase I of the stormwater permitting program.

<Title>OMB Readies A-133 Changes; AICPA Plans New Reporting Guidance</Title>

<I>Implementing the 1996 Amendments</I>

<h2>OMB Readies A-133 Changes; AICPA Plans New Reporting Guidance </h2>

<P>
The Single Audit Act Amendments have set off a new round of changes to federal policy and industry guidance, the first of which will likely be proposed revisions to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133, <I>Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Institutions</I>. The A-133 proposal may be issued later this month, according to OMB officials.
</P>

<P>
Within the next several months, the audit community also can expect drafts of a new compliance supplement (see story, below), revised AICPA reporting guidance and a machine-readable certification form to be submitted with an A-133 audit. All of these components are needed for audits to be performed under the new statutory and regulatory single audit requirements, which apply to audits of fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 1996.
</P>

<P>
The first move will be another proposal to revise Circular A-133, which will include plans to rescind Circular A-128, <I>Audits of State and Local Governments</I>. Coupled with the Circular A-133 revisions issued last April, the proposed revision would fully implement the recent amendments to the Single Audit Act, OMB officials told attendees of AICPA's National Governmental Accounting and Auditing Update Conference in August.
</P>

<P>
The Single Audit Act Amendments (P.L. 104-156) brought all non-federal entities under the same audit requirements. To implement the statutory changes, OMB plans to apply Circular A-133 to state and local governments. Several other changes are needed for A-133 to adhere to the statute, including:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
	<LI>adding a two-year grace period before the new report submission deadline takes effect (i.e., nine months after the end of the period audited, beginning with audits of fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 1998); and
</P>	
<P>
	<LI>providing for biennial audits. The Single Audit Act Amendments permit non-profits that had biennial audits for all periods ending between July 1, 1992, and Jan. 1, 1995, to continue to have biennial audits. Likewise, state and local governments can continue to have biennial audits if they have been required by state constitutions or laws in effect on Jan. 1, 1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually. 
</P>
</UL>

<P>
Although the A-133 proposal will focus on new statutory requirements that OMB has little discretion in implementing, other revisions are possible, said Sheila Conley, an OMB policy analyst in the Office of Federal Financial Management, in remarks to AICPA conference participants. In particular, OMB may revisit the issue of who should be responsible for completing the new certificate that must be filed with the audit report under the revised Circular A-133.
</P>

<P>
The April revision added a new reporting requirement for grantees by requiring the management of the audited entity to complete the certificate. The certificate affirms that the auditee engaged the auditor to perform an A-133 audit, contains a series of "yes or no" statements about the audit report and any audit findings, and certifies that the summarized information "accurately and completely reflects the results of this audit."
</P>

<P>
"We would like to get some feedback as to whether or not it would make sense for the auditor to prepare the certification form," Conley said. "Much of the information that will be captured will come directly from the auditor's report." Therefore it may be more efficient for the auditor, rather than the auditee, to prepare the part of the form summarizing the audit report results, while the auditee would still be responsible for signing the certification, she said.
</P>

<P>
The proposal is expected to have a 60-day comment period. The status of the Circular A-133 proposal is available on Thompson Publishing Group's Internet homepage, <A HREF="/tpg/fed_gts/sass/sassnews.html">"Status of OMB Policies"</A>. When issued, the proposed revisions also will be posted on the Thompson Publishing Group site.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>AICPA Will Revise Reporting Guidance</H3>
</P>

<P>
To help auditors perform the new single audits, AICPA plans to issue in early 1997 new guidance for the form and content of single audit reports to correspond with OMB's revised reporting requirements, said Mary Foelster, technical manager of the AICPA Professional Standards and Services Division. The guidance will likely be a revised Statement of Position (SOP) 92-9, <I>Audits of Not-for-Profit Organizations Receiving Federal Awards</I>. The updated SOP will supersede all single audit guidance in the existing SOP 92-9 and the <I>Audit and Accounting Guide for State and Local Governments</I>, Foelster told conference participants.
</P>

<P>
Foelster said that an AICPA task force had developed some ideas for streamlining the reporting package and may recommend reducing the number of required audit reports to three. "There would be a report on the general purpose financial statements or the statements for not-for-profits, a report that would cover the Yellow Book requirements for internal controls and compliance, and a third report that would cover single audit matters, internal controls and compliance for major programs," she said.
</P>

<P>
Illustrative reports also will be included in the revised guidance. "We will provide examples of clean reports and reports that are not as clean," Foelster said. "I expect that we'll have that guidance out in time for auditors to use in planning engagements." 
</P>

<P>
George Rippey, director of technical and non-federal audit staff at the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Inspector General and a member of the AICPA task force working to simplify the reports, elaborated on the upcoming changes. "Through the revisions to the Single Audit Act as well as the proposed changes to the compliance supplement, two reports are going to drop out: the report on non-major programs and the report on compliance with general requirements," Rippey said. In addition, the report on compliance will be at an opinion level rather than having statements of positive or negative assurance, he said.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Impact on Auditors' Work</H3>
</P>

<P>
Speaking at the AICPA conference, federal audit officials discussed how changes to the Single Audit Act and Circular A-133 could impact auditors' work. OMB's Conley said auditors who will no longer be auditing subrecipients expending less than $300,000 a year in federal awards may be in a good position to do other monitoring work for clients that make subawards.
</P>

<P>
Because pass-through entities will not be able to receive federal reimbursement under the revised A-133 for single audits of subrecipients under the threshold, pass-through entities will need to "figure out a different way to exercise that [monitoring] responsibility," Conley said. Those entities can use program and financial reports already being submitted to them, on-site monitoring, financial statement audits and agreed-upon procedures that target specific compliance requirements. Which monitoring tools an entity elects to use will probably depend on how much of its federal awards it is passing through to subrecipients, she said.
</P>

<P>
In the audit engagement and planning process, auditors also will need to estimate the amount of work they will have to do under the revised Circular A-133, particularly in respect to determining major programs through a risk-based approach, planning internal control testing and reporting on compliance.
</P>

<P>
"You as the auditor need to judge the amount, the nature, timing and extent of the work that you do in order to support an opinion on compliance with regard to major programs," Conley said, adding that a new compliance supplement should help auditors in making that assessment. The revised circular also requires auditors to plan to achieve a low assessed level of control risk. Auditors will need to decide how this impacts the rest of their audit work, since they cannot  "just test one or two items," she said.
</P>

<P>
Auditors had been particularly concerned about how the risk-based audit approach to determining major programs would affect their audit work, said Terry Ramsey, a technical and nonfederal audit staff member at the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Inspector General. In revising A-133, OMB tried to address those concerns in several ways, he said.
</P>

<P>
First, the circular caps the number of programs that must be audited under the risk-based approach. Second, the threshold at which a program must undergo a risk assessment is a sliding scale (instead of being fixed at $100,000, as was originally proposed) so auditors of states and other very large entities would not be as burdened. Third, auditors usually will not have to use a risk-based approach when auditing entities for the first time under the new requirements. Ramsey added that, in most cases, a risk assessment can be carried forward from year to year, so an auditor does not need to conduct an assessment every year on the same programs. 
</P>

<P>
The auditor is required to document risk assessments in its work papers, but as long as assessments are conducted in accordance with the circular, federal agencies cannot "second guess" the auditor's judgment, Ramsey said. If an agency wants to provide advice on a program's risk, the auditor can consider that in future audits but does not have to go back to previous audits or make changes to a current audit.

<title>Pension Simplification Measure Signed Into Law</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/pen_ben/sign/signhead.gif" alt="Guide to Assigning &amp; Loaning Benefit Plan Money"></center>
<P>
<h2>Pension Simplification Measure Signed Into Law</h2>

<h3><i>Changes Include QDRO Model Language, Prohibited Transaction Excise
Tax</i></h3>

<P>
On Aug. 20, 1996, President Clinton signed the Small Business Job Protection Act
of 1996 (P.L. 104-188), raising the minimum wage and enacting numerous tax
simplification rules--many of which affect qualified pension and profit sharing
plans. 
</P>

<P>
The new law will change the rules that apply to several compliance requirements
described in the <i>Guide:</i>
</P>

<UL>
<LI> model language for qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs);
<LI> the excise tax on prohibited transactions;
<LI> five-year foward averaging; and 
<LI> plan loan made to reemployed veterans.</UL>

<P>
In addition, the new welfare reform law signed by President Clinton last month
includes a provision affecting qualified medical child support orders (QMEDs).
</P>

<P>
Following is a description of each of these changes.
</P>

<h3>Model QDRO Language</h3>

<P>
Section 1457 of the Act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to develop "sample
language for inclusion in a form for a qualified domestic relations order" that
will meet the requirements for QDROs. 
</P>

<P>
This language must "focus attention" on the need to consider any lump sum payment
options as well as the joint and survivor annuity requirements applicable under
the plan in question. The statutorily mandated form language must be issued by
Jan. 1, 1997, and must be publicized by the Secretary of the Treasury through
"pension outreach efforts" undertaken by the Treasury Department.
</P>

<P>
The Secretary of the Treasury is also supposed to develop sample language for
inclusion in a form for spousal consent required under the tax code and ERISA.
The language must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the
average participant. It must disclose whether a waiver to which a spouse consents
is irrevocable and whether a waiver may be revoked by a QDRO. 
</P>

<P>
This mandate for model QDRO language is unusual because the Secretary of the
Treasury does not have regulatory jurisdiction over the substantive QDRO
requirements. Instead, it is the Department of Labor that is supposed to develop
regulations in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. Therefore, it is
not clear what type of language will be developed by Jan. 1, 1997.
</P>

<h3>Prohibited Transaction Excise Tax</h3>

<P>
The new law increases the prohibited transaction excise tax (see &#182;422 of the
<i>Guide</i>) from 5 percent to 10 percent effective for prohibited transactions
occurring after Aug. 20, 1996, the date of enactment. 
</P>

<P>
It is not entirely clear how this new excise tax applies in the context of
continuing prohibited transactions, such as plan loans. The prohibited
transaction tax for plan loans "pyramids" so that new plan loans are deemed to be
made for each plan year until the loan is corrected (see &#182;422 of the
<i>Guide</i>). It is not clear whether the 10 percent excise tax is supposed to
apply to all "deemed" loans occurring after the date of enactment or whether the
new tax applies only to actual prohibited loans made after that date. 
</P>

<h3>Repeal of Forward Averaging </h3>

<P>
The new law repeals 5-year forward averaging for distributions made after Dec.
31, 1999. However, 10-year forward averaging, which was preserved through changes
made in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, continues to be available for eligible
individuals. (See &#182;515 of the <i>Guide</i> for a discussion of 5-year
forward averaging.)
</P>

<P>
The new law also repeals the excise tax for excess distributions, but only for
distributions in 1997, 1998 and 1999. The tax will apply to distributions made in
later years. (See &#182;514 of the <I>Guide</I> for a discussion of the excess
distribution tax.)
</P>

<h3>Special Plan Loan Rules for Reemployed Veterans</h3> 

<P>
The new law establishes special rules designed to help ease the transition back
into qualified plans for reemployed veterans. These rules provide for special
plan loan repayments by these reemployed veterans. 
</P>

<P>
Under the special loan rules, if a plan suspends the requirement for loan
repayments during an employee's period of qualifying military service, the
suspension period will not be taken into account for any of the plan loan or plan
qualification requirements. Presumably, this means that a plan could simply
disregard the period that the participant was in qualifying military service in
determining whether the plan loan rules are met. (See &#182;430, &#182;433 and
&#182;434 of the Guide for a discussion of the tax code's loan repayment rules.) 
</P>

<P>
For example, suppose a participant is called to active military duty at a time
when he has two years left on a five-year plan loan. Suppose the plan suspends
the required loan repayments for any period of such active duty. If he is in
service for one year, then on his return, the new provision would allow the plan
to disregard the one year of no repayments. Presumably, this means that upon the
participant's reemployment, the participant will be treated as if his loan still
had two years left during which it has to be repaid. 
</P>

<P>
This clarifying provision is effective retroactively to Dec. 12, 1994, the date
that the veteran's reemployment rights act was most recently amended. 
</P>

<P>
The legislative language for these rules is not as precise as it could be. For
example, it is not clear whether interest that accrues during the loan suspension
period must continue to accrue or whether it is ignored for purposes of the loan
suspension. Nevertheless, having some legislative language on which to rely will
be helpful to plans trying to develop a policy for dealing with outstanding plan
loans.
</P>

<h3>QMED Change in Welfare Reform Bill</h3>

<P>
Additionally, the new welfare reform legislation signed by President Clinton on
Aug. 22 clarifies the definition of a qualified medical child support order
(QMED). 
</P>

<P>
Before this new law, qualified orders under ERISA generally had to be issued by a
court (see &#182;625 of the <i>Guide</i>). This led to a good deal of confusion,
as many state administrative agencies had the authority to issue support orders
that were binding for purposes of state law, but not for the ERISA rules
governing QMEDs. According to the new rule, qualified orders will now include a
judgment, decree or order issued through a legally binding administrative process
under state law. This new change reflects a liberalization of the rules governing
qualified medical child support orders.

<html> <title> NAIC Revises Model Coordination of Benefits Regulation </title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/pen_ben/cobs/cobshead.gif" alt="Coordination of Benefits
Handbook"></center>
<P>
<h2>NAIC Revises Model Coordination of Benefits Regulation<P></h2>
<body>

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has rewritten its
model rule on coordination of health benefits to clarify its wording, as well as
to address a number of technical issues. Although the NAIC rule is not law, the
model is used by the various states as a framework upon which they may base their
own coordination rules. Many states adopt the model as drafted by the NAIC;
others choose to adopt it with specified modifications. (See &#182;900 of the
<i>Handbook</i>.) <P>

Some of the changes adopted by the NAIC in its 1996 revision are noted below.<P>

<UL>
<LI><i>Conflicting COB</i> -- Under the revised NAIC model, if two plans cannot
agree on the order of benefit payment within 30 days after the plans have
received all of the information needed to pay the claim, the plans must
immediately pay the claims in equal shares. After payment is made, the plans are
to resolve their relative liabilities. No plan, however, is required to pay more
than it would have to pay if it were primary.<P>

<LI><i>COB for Dependent Children</i> -- The prior version of the model
determined the order of benefit payment for dependent children in instances in
which a child's parents were divorced or separated. Under the revised rule, the
NAIC has redrafted the rules so that they address the order of benefit payment
for dependent children of unmarried parents. <P>

</UL> 
Essentially, the rule looks to the custodial relationship between the parent and
the child, rather than to the marital status of the parents. An additional
determining factor is court-assigned financial responsibility for health care
coverage of the dependent child; if the parent with financial responsibility
provides that coverage by virtue of a spouse's plan, then the spouse's plan would
be primary to the plan of a parent without financial responsibility.<P>

<UL>
<LI><i>Definition of Custodial Parent</i> -- Under the revised rules, a new
definition is added to explain that the custodial parent is the individual
awarded custody by a court decree. If there is no court decree, the parent with
whom the child resides for more than one-half the year is deemed to be the
custodial parent. <P>

<LI><i>Definition of Allowable Expense</i> -- Deductibles, coinsurance, and
copayments are now specifically included in the definition of the term "Allowable
Expense." The definition additionally clarifies that a primary plan's reduction
of benefits because of failure to utilize the services of a preferred provider is
an exclusion from the Allowable Expense. <P>
</UL>

The section providing examples of expenses that are not allowable has been
expanded. Expenses above the highest usual and customary fee (where both plans
use that method to compute benefits), or the highest negotiated fee (where both
plans negotiate fees) are not allowable. If one plan uses usual and customary
fees and the other plan negotiates fees, the Allowable Expense will not exceed
the primary plan's payment arrangement. <P>

The NAIC believes that COB should not be used to increase a provider payment in a
case where the provider has agreed to accept a negotiated rate, and encourages
plans to include provisions in their provider contracts to account for payments
under coordination of benefits.<P>

<UL>
<LI><i>Definition of "Closed Panel Plan"</i> -- The revised rule contains a new
definition to describe a plan that covers participants by providing services
through a panel of providers that contract with or are employed by the plan; this
definition applies to HMOs, PPOs, and EPOs among other types of plans. In
describing the use of the model COB rule, the NAIC notes that in most instances,
COB does not occur if a covered person is enrolled in two or more closed panel
plans and obtains services from a provider in one of the plans because the other
plan (whose providers were not used) has no liability.<P>

<LI><i>Order of Benefit Determination</i> -- In the event that none of the rules
governing the order of benefit determination applies to a particular situation, a
default provision has been added that would require the plans pay the allowable
expenses in equal shares.<P>

<LI><i>"Plain English" Description of COB</i> -- The NAIC has issued a new
appendix to the model regulation, entitled the <i>Consumer Explanatory
Booklet</i> which describes the operation of COB, including a section which
discuses the operation of a "benefits bank" or "benefits reserve" under COB (that
is, a reserve established in instances when a plan "saves" by properly paying
benefits on a secondary basis). <P>

</UL>
The revised 1996 NAIC model regulation is included with this issue's supplement
to the <i>Handbook</i>, to be inserted at Appendix I. <P>

<title>DOL Plan Asset Rules Will Affect Plan Loan Programs</title>

<h2>DOL Plan Asset Rules Will Affect Plan Loan Programs</h2>

The Department of Labor issued final regulations last month governing the timing
of when participant contributions are to be treated as "plan assets" that must be
placed in trust. These final regulations, which generally go into effect Feb. 3,
1997, require that participant contributions be treated as plan assets as soon as
they can reasonably be segregated from the employer's assets, but not later than
15 business days after the end of the month in which the participant
contributions are withheld or received by the employer.<P>

The final regulations were published at 61 <i>Fed. Reg</i>. 41220 (Aug. 7,
1996).<P>

<h3>Repayment via Payroll Deduction</h3><P>

The new regulations were aimed at plans, such as 401(k) plans, that allow for
participant contributions through pre-tax salary reduction agreements as well as
after-tax payroll deductions. However, they will also affect plan loan programs.
When participants obtain plan loans, they typically agree to payroll deductions
for the repayment of the loans. Sometimes, though, payroll deduction might not be
available. Plan loans must be made available to all participants who are
employees of the employer, even those for whom payroll deduction is not
available. (See &#182;413 of the <i>Guide.</i>) Further, a plan loan might be
repaid outside of payroll if the participant is on a leave of absence.<P>

In the context of the final plan asset regulations, plan loan repayments are
treated as all other participant contributions. Therefore, they must be
transmitted to a plan's trust no later than the 15th day of the month after the
month in which the funds are withheld or received by the employer. This is the
rule regardless of whether or not payroll deduction is available. Of course, if
there is payroll deduction available, as is true in many loan situations, the
plan asset regulation's timing rule should be met through the same system that
remits other participant contributions to the trust made via payroll
deduction.<P>

<h3>Other Repayment Options</h3><P>

A more difficult situation arises where a participant is repaying a loan outside
of the regular payroll deduction mechanism. In such a case, plan administrators
need to consider administrative designs to assure that participant repayments
will be transferred to the plan's trust as soon as possible after they are
received by the plan administrator.<P>

Some employers that commented on the proposed rule (issued last December) had
asked the DOL for a special provision to liberalize the time within which
non-payroll deduction loan repayments had to be transferred to a trust. However,
the DOL indicated in the preamble to the final regulation that such a rule was
beyond the scope of the regulation and that there was not enough evidence upon
which the DOL could base an exception.<P>

<h3>Review Administrative Procedures</h3><P>

In the preamble to the final regulations, the DOL indicated its view that "[a]n
employer's failure to transmit loan payments within a reasonable time after
withholding or receiving them could subject the employer to liability for
violations of the same provisions of ERISA and criminal law that are violated
when an employer is delinquent in forwarding participant contributions to plans."
Thus, plan loan administrators should review their procedures to assure
compliance with the plan asset regulations. In particular, administrators should
examine the following three questions. <P>

<i>Are plan loan repayments remitted to the plan's trust as soon as possible
after they are received by the plan administrator? </i><P>

If a plan administrator is holding on to plan loan repayments for an unduly long
period of time, the administrator may be subjecting itself to fiduciary
liability. This may require the fiduciary to make the plan participant whole for
any lost interest.<P>

<i>Is the plan administrator holding on to plan loan repayments when there is a
change in recordkeeper? </i><P>

If so, there could be a violation. The DOL does not recognize an exception from
the plan asset regulations merely because an employer is changing recordkeepers
or trustees. According to the DOL, "a change in recordkeepers or other service
providers to a plan should not affect the maximum allowable period before
participant contributions become plan assets."<P>

<i>Are plan loan repayments handled through a different payroll deduction
mechanism than participant pre-tax or after-tax contributions? </i><P>

If so, the systems should be coordinated to avoid any violations of the plan
asset requirements. <P>

<Title> OMB Plans to Combine Three Cost Principles</Title> <P>

<h2> OMB Plans to Combine Three Cost Principles</h2>

<body><i>Officials Discuss Changes to Circulars A-21 and A-122</i><P>

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recently announced long-term plans to
merge its cost principles so that one document would govern how costs are treated
for almost all types of federal funding recipients. OMB officials said they hope
to start working on a proposal, which would consolidate Circulars A-87, A-21 and
A-122, in late 1997. <P>

"One of our goals at OMB is to bring symmetry among the cost principle circulars,
and we're going to be looking very carefully over the next year at merging all
cost principle circulars so that non-profits, states and universities are treated
alike," said Norwood Jackson Jr., deputy controller in OMB's Office of Federal
Financial Management. Hospitals would remain subject to cost regulations of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).<P>

OMB officials discussed recent and proposed revisions to the circulars in
speeches at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Not-for-Profit
Industry conference in Washington, D.C., in June. In particular, officials said
they hoped to issue revisions to Circular A-122, <i>Cost Principles for Non-Profit
Organizations</i>, by the end of the year, but indicated that certain proposed
changes may be postponed or dropped altogether.<P>

OMB proposed in October 1995 to cap at 26 percent the administrative cost rate of
non-profit organizations receiving $10 million in federal awards. Circular A-21,
<i>Cost Principles for Educational Institutions</i>, includes such a cap for all
colleges and universities. Applying the same cap to non-profits would be
consistent, but OMB has little data for selecting an administrative cost limit
appropriate for non-profit organizations, officials said.<P>

OMB is now rethinking the proposal. Many federal agencies and non-profit
organizations oppose the provision (see July 1996 <i>Current Developments</i>, Page 1).
"There are those who feel very strongly that we should cap the administrative
portion of indirect costs, much as we have with regard to colleges and
universities. But there are those who are arguing, and I think they may well be
right, that non-profits are not just like colleges and universities," Jackson
said.<P>

It is possible that advice to drop the cap will be heeded when revisions to the
circular are finalized, said OMB Policy Analyst Gil Tran, in remarks at the AICPA
conference. Tran recommends that OMB delete for now the proposal from the final
revisions, and instead ask the non-profit community for more input on the
proposed cap. "If they're serious about capping, I think it's probably worthwhile
for us to take a look at and collect some data, and [then] propose a cap," Tran
said.<P>

Delaying implementation of an administrative cost cap pending further study would
be agreeable to HHS, said Charles Gale, director of grants policy and oversight
at HHS, in a separate response. Gale and other federal agency representatives had
written OMB to oppose the 26 percent cap.<P>

Non-profit organizations have been slow to supply OMB with the data it needs to
develop a suitable limit on administrative costs. In particular, OMB is
requesting non-profits receiving more than $10 million in federal awards to try
to develop a university-style indirect cost model that would show what their
indirect cost rate would be. "No one gave us that, and what bothers me about it,
it puts me in a very difficult situation," Jackson said. "Because if your
indirect cost rate relative to administrative costs should legitimately be
greater than 26 percent, nobody has given me a case to support that statement.
And so that makes it very difficult for OMB to defend you if you in fact should
get a higher rate."<P>

In fact, National Institutes of Health (NIH) data appear to show that 26 percent
would be a relatively generous administrative rate for non-profit research
institutions, Tran said. For non-profits included in the statistics, their
general and administrative cost rate average was 19 percent. However, the NIH
survey produced somewhat flawed results, because non-profits do not have a
standard way of calculating their rate based on modified total direct costs, he
said. "Also, some non-profit organizations ... are single function, and therefore
they use the direct allocation method and direct charge their administrative
costs. That's why the administrative [portion] is so low."<P>

Tran told conference attendees that, if implemented, the 26 percent cap would
include all administrative costs, not just general and administrative. That means
that facilities-related costs, such as building use allowance, depreciation, and
operations and maintenance, would be allocated to administrative functions using
that portion of the facilities. Those additional costs "would be counted against
the 26 percent cap," Tran said.<P>

Under OMB's proposal, non-profits receiving more than $10 million in direct and
indirect costs also would be required to use a multiple allocation base method
patterned after that required of universities receiving more than $10 million in
direct costs. "It's going to make the development of the indirect cost rate
proposals or recovery methods a bit more difficult," but would "treat large
non-profits in a manner similar to colleges and universities," Jackson said.<P>

Non-profits wrote OMB to express concern about other proposed revisions to
Circular A-122. OMB proposed to not allow malpractice insurance as an indirect
cost, as is the case under Circular A-21. "Some organizations have come up to us
and said they're whole function is to provide health care, so malpractice
insurance is critical. In those cases, they have a point," Tran said. But those
non-profit organizations would be able to claim malpractice insurance as a <i>direct</i>
cost, he emphasized. "It will always be allowable as a direct cost to the special
projects that require human subjects."<P>

Tran acknowledged the unpopularity of another provision borrowed from A-21: a
proposal to not allow the cost of trustees' travel. He is recommending that OMB
abandon this proposal.<P>

Upon the urging of the U.S. Agency for International Development, OMB also is
re-examining its proposal to disallow excess severance and foreign nationals'
severance pay. "If we're going to employ a foreign national, is it reasonable for
us to disallow what is comparable salary for that country?" OMB is talking with
officials at USAID to find a way of dealing with the issue.<P>

Included in the A-122 proposal is a provision to raise the equipment
capitalization level to $5,000, which is parallel with the definition of
equipment in Circular A-110, <i>Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and
Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit
Organizations</i>. OMB also told federal agencies a year ago that they could
implement a $5,000 threshold for university and non-profit recipients.<P>

While the higher threshold is not controversial, it may be difficult for some
organizations to implement, Tran said. First, a non-profit will have to use
whatever equipment capitalization level is specified in its financial statement
if that level is less than $5,000. Also, when converting from a lower (e.g.,
$500) to a higher (e.g., $2,500) threshold for capitalizing equipment, "there's a
bunch of equipment in there [between the two levels] that you have not fully
depreciated or recovered the full cost," Tran said.<P>

Organizations can use one of two methods to recover those costs. They can
continue to claim use allowance or depreciation on the equipment that now falls
under the capitalization threshold, but they must continue to keep records on
that equipment. "Basically you have to prove that this equipment is still usable
and is being used for the benefit of federal programs," Tran said, "so that's the
drawback."<P>

Alternatively, an organization can make arrangements with its federal cost
negotiator to amortize the amount to be written off over several years. "In most
cases, [cost negotiators] would not allow you to take the whole amount in one
year, because I don't think you can just retire all the equipment in one year,"
Tran said. <P>

<h3><i>Final Revisions to Circulars A-21, A-122</I></h3><P>

OMB officials discussed the inclusion of certain Cost Accounting Standards Board
(CASB) requirements in the May 8 revisions to Circular A-21. "We felt that the
standards were mom and apple pie' standards, and they should be extended to all
sponsored agreements to the university community, because in some cases they
didn't do anything that wasn't already accomplished by A-21," Jackson said. To
avoid any confusion over having two entities making cost accounting rules, OMB
arranged for the Office of Federal Financial Management, rather than CASB, to
answer universities' questions about the standards.<P>

Many colleges and universities had not wanted the cost accounting standards
applied to them. OMB officials acknowledged that Cost Accounting Standard 502,
<i>Consistency in Allocating Costs Incurred for the Same Purpose by Educational
Institutions</i>, was particularly controversial. For example, some universities were
concerned that the standard would prohibit them from directly charging clerical
salaries and wages, even when administrative staff work solely on federally
funded projects.<P>

"If you read the cost accounting standards verbatim, it seems to disallow it
[direct charging of administrative salaries and wages], but we have an
interpretation in A-21 that allows those types of costs ... for major projects,"
Tran said. "I don't anticipate any problem with that." OMB is working with HHS
and the Defense Contract Audit Agency to ensure that federal agencies and
auditors understand what kinds of allocation methods are allowable under the cost
accounting standard.<P>

Extending CASB's disclosure statement (Form DS-2) to colleges and universities
receiving $25 million or more in federal awards also was unpopular, as many
institutions thought the submission would be overly burdensome, Jackson said. "I
understand where people are coming from there, but we felt that if organizations
received over $25 million in federal funds, they should, as part of their normal
business behavior, be prepared to disclose their cost accounting practices to
federal cost negotiation agencies." <P>

The A-21 revision also raised the equipment capitalization level to the lesser of
$5,000 or the threshold used in the institution's financial statements. Tran
noted that colleges and universities could encounter the same kinds of problems
when converting the equipment threshold as would non-profits. In that case,
institutions would have the same two options for recovering costs: (1) continuing
to claim depreciation or use allowance, or (2) amortization.<P>

OMB also added a provision to Circular A-21 to require a fixed facilities and
administrative cost rate to be used for the life of the federal award. Tran
predicted that federal awarding agencies may choose to extend this requirement to
non-profit organizations in rate negotiations. "We've issued this guideline to
federal agencies to use a fixed rate throughout the project, period," he said, so
agencies have the option of applying it to non-profit awards. <P>

Tran also addressed some questions that had been raised about OMB's Oct. 6, 1995,
revision to Circular A-122. He emphasized that the Sept. 29, 1995, effective date
for allowing interest on facilities acquisitions applies to the date the building
becomes occupied. The needs justification requirement (which applies to
facilities costing more than $10 million and where the federal government's
reimbursement will be at least 40 percent of the facility's cost) must be met for
both the interest and any use allowance or depreciation on that building to be
allowable. Also, interest on equipment is allowable for new acquisitions only. A
grantee cannot terminate a lease on a piece of equipment and then buy the same
piece of equipment, Tran said. <P>

<Title> Updated Compliance Supplement Taking Shape</Title>

<h2> Updated Compliance Supplement Taking Shape</h2>

<P>
<I><B>OMB Hopes to Release Initial Draft This Month</B></I>
</P>

<P>
A description of the audit process, definitions of types of compliance requirements and detailed guidance on internal controls will be among the new features of a combined and revised compliance supplement that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) hopes to finalize in early 1997.
</P>

<P>
OMB officials and members of a federal task force revising the compliance supplement announced their plans in August at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) National Governmental Accounting and Auditing Update Conference in Washington, D.C. OMB may send out early drafts for comment this month or early October to federal agencies, the AICPA, the National State Auditors Association and other interested groups. 
</P>

<P>
A new supplement is crucial to ensure that auditors can follow the requirements of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and revised OMB Circular A-133, <I>Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Institutions</I>, both of which apply to audits of fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 1996, officials told conference attendees. 
</P>

<P>
"Now the pressure is on us to get the compliance supplement out," said Dennis Duquette, deputy inspector general for management and policy at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and chair of OMB's inter-agency task force revising the document. "We'll probably be moving into a major review of the whole compliance supplement later in the year, the October or November time frame, if everything goes according to schedule," he added.
</P>

<P>
Because the supplement must be issued in time for audits under the revised A-133, drafts of the supplement will probably be issued piecemeal. The federal task force is aiming to complete work on the larger programs first, so different federal agencies' sections of the compliance supplement may be released at different times. A less formal feedback process is being used in place of a <I>Federal Register</I> notice because of the tight deadline and the fact that the document is not mandatory guidance, officials said. Also, OMB hopes to put the revised compliance supplement on its homepage on the Internet. By making the document available electronically, Duquette said, "we can literally update the information and add programs to it as we go along."
</P>

<P>
In 1990, OMB issued the <I>Compliance Supplement for Single Audits of State and Local Governments</I>, and followed suit in 1991 with the <I>Compliance Supplement for Audits of Institutions of Higher Learning and Other Non-Profit Institutions</I>. The programs' compliance requirements cited in both documents are out-of-date, said Terry Ramsey, technical and non-federal audit staff for the U.S. Department of Education and a member of the compliance supplement task force.
</P>

<P>
Auditors want the compliance supplement to be a safe harbor, and "we're working towards that," Ramsey said. The task force is hoping to revise the supplement annually, he said. However, auditors will have to remain alert to changes in compliance requirements not reflected in the supplement and adjust their audit procedures accordingly. 
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Broader Scope, Different Format</H3>
</P>

<P>
Rather than merely updating the requirements listed for federal programs, the task force is trying to address other problems with the current compliance supplements. For example, the existing documents are not kept up-to-date and standard audit procedures for compliance requirements are inconsistent, Ramsey told participants at AICPA's conference. 
</P>

<P>
"You'll be testing the same thing, and one time it will tell you to do 'A' and another time it will tell you to do 'B,'" making it hard to use those standard audit procedures for audits of programs not included in the compliance supplement, Ramsey said. He listed other perceived weaknesses with the existing documents that OMB hopes to fix: the types of program-specific compliance requirements -- such as allowable services and eligibility -- are not defined or explained; the special tests and provisions listed for a program may include requirements that are also listed in the general requirements section of the supplements; and the documents give no guidance on internal control testing.
</P>

<P>
The new compliance supplement will have a different format from OMB's two existing supplements. Ramsey said the new compliance supplement will likely include:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
	<LI>an introduction that gives an overview of the audit process;
</P>
<P>
	<LI>a matrix listing all the federal programs included in the compliance supplement and indicating what types of compliance requirements apply to each program; 
</P>	
<P>
	<LI>a discussion of common requirements;
</P>
<P>
	<LI>a discussion of federal programs and their specific requirements;
</P>
<P>
	<LI>a discussion of generic audit procedures that can be followed for each type of compliance requirement (e.g., testing compliance with a matching requirement);
</P>
<P>
	<LI>a discussion of internal controls over compliance; and
</P>
<P>
	<LI>a separate supplement for housing authorities.
</P>
</UL>
<P>
The introduction will give auditors guidance on the single audit process, highlighting recent changes. "One thing auditors are going to have to start looking for now is to see if any compliance requirements have been waived," Ramsey said. Since waivers are permitted under many federal programs, the first step for the auditor will be to determine whether any waivers have been granted to a federal award recipient. "The auditors are going to have to use some judgment on asking for some documentation to support the waiver," he said.
</P>

<P>
The current general requirements section will be renamed the "common" compliance requirements, Ramsey said. Under the revised Circular A-133, the auditor will have to give an opinion on a recipient's compliance with both common and specific requirements (in contrast to the auditor reporting on the general requirements and rendering an opinion only on the specific requirements). The federal task force is rewriting the section to ensure it's compatible with the revised circular. "We'll only put things in there auditors can give an opinion on," he said. For example, Drug-Free Workplace Act requirements will not be included. Each common requirement will be followed by a succinct audit objective -- "to help guide the auditor in what their work is supposed to be focused on" -- and then suggested audit procedures, Ramsey said. 
</P>

<P>
The specific requirements section will give the auditor program-specific information (program objectives, procedures and compliance requirements). As with the existing supplements, program requirements will be grouped into categories: types of services allowed; eligibility; matching, level-of-effort and/or earmarking; special reporting; and special tests and provisions. However, the new supplement will not include suggested audit procedures for each program, Ramsey said. Instead, audit procedures will be based on each category of requirements -- termed "types of compliance requirements."
</P>

<P>
To develop an audit procedure for a certain type of requirement, auditors would refer to a section in the compliance supplement containing generic audit procedures, Ramsey said. This section would define, give an audit objective and suggest audit procedures for testing compliance with each type of requirement. The discussion for a particular type of requirement, such as eligibility, would be generic and not in reference to any particular program. 
</P>

<P>
By grouping program requirements into "types," the compliance supplement will be consistent with the revised Circular A-133, Ramsey said. Under the new circular, "when you're reporting audit findings, your audit finding will be material for a type of compliance requirement or the audit objective in the compliance supplement," he said. Therefore, the types of requirements identified in an audit report will match the types of requirements listed in the compliance supplement. Categorizing requirements into generic "types" may make it easier for auditors to use the document as a guide for auditing programs not included in it, he added. The new compliance supplement is expected to cover about 150 programs, so it will not contain many of the smaller federal programs. 
</P>

<P>
The exception to using generic audit procedures will be for any special tests and provisions of a program, Ramsey said. If a program has statutory or regulatory requirements that do not easily fit into a standard type of requirement (allowable services; eligibility; matching, level-of-effort and earmarking; and special reporting), the audit objective and suggested audit procedures will tailored to those requirements. 
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>New Audit Tools to Be Included</H3>
</P>

<P>
The matrix concept is aimed at giving auditors an at-a-glance summary of which types of compliance requirements apply to each program, Ramsey said. For example, in the matrix, an auditor would be able to see that a particular program has rules on allowable activities but no matching requirements. The auditor would also be able to assess whether any general requirements do not apply to a particular program.
</P>

<P>
A new section on internal controls will be helpful for auditors who are testing controls over major programs and provide illustrations for federal award recipients about what kinds of controls they should have in place, Ramsey said.

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>What Are 'Generic Audit Procedures'?</H4>
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="2">The federal task force working on the new compliance supplement envisions a process where auditors will use generic audit procedures for each type of compliance requirement to test for a recipient's compliance with specific program requirements. Participants at AICPA's conference were given examples of what this generic approach might look like. The example of one type of compliance requirement (eligibility) that follows is only illustrative and is not official guidance from OMB.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
	<LI><I>Definition of Eligibility</I>: This type of compliance includes requirements that the award be limited to certain individuals, groups of individuals or subrecipients.
</P>

<P>
	<LI><I>Audit Objective</I>: To determine whether (a) the individuals or groups of individuals who received benefits from the federal program were eligible to receive the benefits, (b) the subawards were made only to eligible subrecipients, and (c) the amounts provided to eligibles were calculated correctly.
</P>	

<P>
	<LI><I>Generic Audit Procedures for Testing Eligibility of Individuals</I>: Select a representative sample of transactions and perform tests to determine whether the eligibility compliance requirements have been met for specific transactions. This testing should address whether the individual receiving benefits was eligible and that the amount paid to the individual was correctly calculated. The auditor should be alert to whether any benefits were for individuals or groups of individuals which are specifically classified in the compliance requirements as ineligible.</P>
</UL>


<P>
Separate procedures would be suggested for testing eligibility for areas of service delivery and eligibility for subrecipients.

<h2> OMB Issues Final Revisions to Circular A-133</h2>

<body>

<i>Many Changes Parallel Single Audit Legislation </i><P>

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued on April 30 a revised Circular
A-133, <i>Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit
Institutions</i>. The changes raise the audit threshold to $300,000, establish a
risk-based approach to determining which programs to audit, and expand the
responsibilities and requirements of grantees undergoing audits. In addition, the
revisions to Circular A-133 affect what has to be included in the audit report
and when the report must be submitted. Some grantees also will see a change in
who they can select to perform their audits and what responsibilities they have
over subrecipients.<P>

The new A-133 applies to non-profit entities expending (rather than receiving)
$300,000 or more of federal awards in a fiscal year. Non-U.S. based recipients
and subrecipients are excluded from the scope of the circular. The circular still
focuses its audit coverage on "major programs," but now requires auditors to
consider the "risk" of a program.<P>

Proposed restrictions on selecting auditors who have prepared an entity's cost
allocation plan or indirect cost proposal were modified in the final revision so
they affect only relatively large organizations. Other ideas, such as allowing
triennial audits for low-risk auditees and requiring management letters to be
included in the audit report, were not adopted.<P>

OMB shortened the deadline for submitting audit reports from 13 months to nine.
The circular now makes it easier for organizations to be eligible to have
program-specific audits by allowing a group of similar programs to be treated as
a single program. Most provisions of the new A-133 are effective for fiscal years
ending on or after June 30, 1997.<P>

The revised circular in many ways parallels proposed legislation to amend the
Single Audit Act. "Provisions were made to easily adapt Circular A-133 to include
state and local governments if the Single Audit Act is amended," OMB said in the
preamble to the revision.<P>

<h3>Determining Major Programs, Audit Coverage</h3><P>

To determine major programs, auditors will follow a series of steps using both
dollar thresholds and risk-based criteria. "Type A" programs will be those
exceeding:<P>

<UL>
<LI>$300,000 or 3 percent of federal expenditures when all federal expenditures
total $100 million or less;<P>

<LI>$3 million or .3 percent of federal expenditures when all such expenditures
are more than $100 million but are less than or equal to $10 billion; or<P>

<LI>$30 million or .15 percent of federal expenditures when all such
expenditures are greater than $10 billion. </UL><P>

Programs under these dollar thresholds will be called "Type B" programs. Type A
programs that are deemed to be low-risk will not have to be audited unless needed
to ensure that 50 percent of the entity's total federal expenditures are covered
by the audit. A program could qualify as low risk if it has been audited as a
major program at least once during the past two audit periods under the new
circular and had no findings in the most recent audit period. However, OMB gives
auditors discretion in deciding whether findings from questioned costs, fraud and
follow-up from prior audit findings "do not preclude the Type A program from
being low-risk." <P>

Type B programs will have to be audited only if they are identified as high-risk,
or if necessary to comply with the 50 percent rule. Auditors are expected to use
"professional judgment" in assessing a program's or entity's risk. OMB lists
numerous factors that can affect risk and notes that some factors should weigh
more heavily than others. Potential indications of a high risk program include
findings from previous audits, weak internal controls, weak systems for
monitoring subrecipients, new or recently modified computer systems, grantor
agencies' discovery of problems, new programs or new program rules, or the entity
is a new federal grantee. <P>

Two general rules apply in deciding how many programs must be audited. No more
high-risk Type B programs must be audited than the number of low-risk Type A
programs identified by the auditor. In other words, the number of programs
audited under a risk-based approach may be no more than the number of programs
audited under the dollar thresholds. However, the 50 percent rule overrides this
cap on the number of programs audited. The required coverage of federal
expenditures must be met regardless of the number of high-risk Type B or low-risk
Type A programs identified. If the auditee as a whole is assessed as low-risk,
then the mandatory coverage is lowered to 25 percent.<P>

 An auditee may be deemed as low-risk, and be eligible for 25 percent coverage of
federal expenditures, if they meet other criteria, such as receiving unqualified
opinions on their financial statements and schedule of expenditures of federal
awards, and having no material weaknesses in internal controls.<P>

 In addition, a federal agency or pass-through grantee can request that a program
be audited as major and pay the full incremental cost of covering that program.
Auditors can defer implementing a risk-based approach for first-year audits
(including the first year an entity is audited under the revised circular).<P>

<h3>Grantee Responsibilities Under Circular A-133</h3><P>

Grantees, whether they are primary recipients (called pass-through entities in
the circular) or subrecipients, will have new responsibilities in the audit
process. While many requirements articulated by OMB in the revised circular are
already standard practice, such as preparing financial statements and schedules
of federal awards, the circular gives new details on the type of information that
must be included.<P>

For example, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards should "include notes
that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule"
and state the dollar threshold used in identifying Type A and Type B programs.
Pass-through entities are asked to identify, to the extent practical, in their
schedule how much of their federal awards is passed through to subrecipients from
each program that is audited as major.<P>

In addition, auditees now must prepare a certification about the audit results
and a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The audited entity's management
must certify certain basic information about the audit, including whether there
are any findings and the amount of questioned costs under each federal program.
Subrecipients must submit their certification not only to the Federal Audit
Clearinghouse, but also to pass-through entities. However, the full report must
be sent to pass-throughs only when findings or prior audit findings relate to
federal awards provided by the pass-through entity. Management letters do not
have to be included in the reporting package, OMB decided, but must be available
to federal agencies or pass-through entities if requested.<P>

The revised circular spells out OMB's expectations for pass-through entities'
monitoring of subrecipients, but does not add as many new requirements as had
been proposed. The March 1995 proposal would have allowed federal agencies to
require pass-through entities to arrange for audits of subrecipients receiving
less than $300,000 in federal awards. After many commenters objected, OMB elected
not to include this idea in the revision. However, OMB stated in the preamble
that "both the pass-through entity and the pass-through entity's auditors have
responsibilities for these funds even when an audit of the subrecipient is not
required."<P>

Primary recipients may need to do additional monitoring, and their auditors "will
need to consider obtaining compliance assurances by reviewing the pass-through
entity's records and monitoring procedures, performing additional procedures to
determine compliance, such as testing the subrecipient's records, or a
combination of procedures," OMB said. The pass-through entity's auditor also must
determine whether that entity's system for monitoring subrecipients is adequate,
and whether the pass-through entity's records should be adjusted due to
subrecipient noncompliance, OMB continued.<P>

<h3>Restrictions on Auditor Selection</h3><P>

In response to federal agency concerns about auditors' independence, OMB had
considered restricting auditors (and their accounting firms) who prepare cost
allocation plans, indirect cost proposals or disclosure statements required by
Circular A-21 for a entity from performing an A-133 audit for the same entity. As
proposed, the restriction would have applied when indirect costs charged were
greater than 5 percent of any Type A program's expenditures or greater than 5
percent of expenditures for all federal programs.<P>

Since many grantees and auditors opposed this proposal, the final version aims to
restrict auditor selection only for the largest grantees. Instead of setting the
threshold as a percentage of expenditures, grantees will have to comply with the
provision if they recovered more than $1 million in indirect costs during the
year prior to the year to be audited. An OMB official said that around 200
colleges and universities and 150 non-profit organizations would be affected by
the rule.<P>

When a grantee has a multi-year indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan,
the restriction applies to the base year used in the preparation of those
documents and any years after in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or
allocation plan is used to recover costs. "We want the auditor to be independent
of the base year and the years where that [agreement] is used," the official
said.<P>

The restriction will not apply to auditors who prepare a university's disclosure
statements required under Circular A-21 (see story, page 1). The provision
applies to fiscal years ending on or after June 30, 1999. OMB said the effective
date is delayed two years to give auditees time to switch auditors if needed.<P>

<h3>Other Changes in Audit Requirements</h3><P>

The revised Circular A-133 offers more flexibility to permit program-specific
audits. A program-specific audit is allowed when a grantee spends federal awards
under only one program and the recipient is not otherwise required to have a
financial statement audit. However, "federal program" is redefined so that all
federal awards made from one agency for the same purpose should be considered one
program. Likewise, states can combine funding for similar federal programs in
making awards to subrecipients. Therefore, an entity expending funds under
programs with the same compliance requirements may be eligible to have a
program-specific audit.<P>

In addition, institutions receiving research and development awards can have a
program-specific audit if those awards are from the same federal agency (and
pass-through entity, if applicable) and a program-specific audit is approved in
advance.<P>

Although OMB had floated the idea of triennial audits for low-risk auditees, that
idea was not adopted. Audits must be performed annually for all recipients.
However, federal or pass-through agencies can allow recipients having
program-specific audits to undergo audits every two years, with the audit
covering both years.<P>

OMB added more specific guidance for auditors on reporting audit findings and set
a $10,000 threshold for reporting questioned costs. However, OMB dropped a
proposal to require a management assertion and auditor attestation for internal
control or compliance.<P>

The deadline for submitting audit reports was shortened from 13 months to nine
months after the end of the period audited. Even if the reports are completed
before then, they should be submitted to the clearinghouse 30 days after the
auditor issues the report to the grantee. Auditees must make copies of the report
available for public inspection, unless any law or regulation prohibits it.

<h2>New Circular A-133 Marks Broad Changes to Audit Requirements</h2> The Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) has revised its Circular A-133, <i>Audits of
Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Institutions</i>. The new
circular emphasizes targeting audit resources to areas of greater risk, getting
better information from the audit process and freeing up some federal funds to be
used for program purposes. <P>

To accomplish this, OMB made numerous changes to the circular. The audit
threshold was raised to $300,000, a risk-based approach was established for
determining which programs to audit, and more specific guidance was added to
permit program-specific audits. In addition, the revisions to Circular A-133
address what elements to include in the audit report and when the report must be
submitted. <P>

The new A-133 applies to non-profit entities expending (rather than receiving)
$300,000 or more of federal awards in a fiscal year. Non-U.S. based recipients
and subrecipients are excluded from the scope of the circular. The circular still
focuses its audit coverage on "major programs," but now requires auditors to
consider the "risk" of a program.<P>

Proposed restrictions on selecting auditors who have prepared an entity's cost
allocation plan or indirect cost proposal were modified in the final revision so
they affect only relatively large organizations. Other ideas, such as allowing
triennial audits for low-risk auditees and requiring management letters to be
included in the audit report, were not adopted. OMB shortened the deadline for
submitting audit reports from 13 months to nine. Most provisions of the new A-133
are effective for fiscal years ending on or after June 30, 1997.<P>

The revised circular in many ways parallels proposed legislation to amend the
Single Audit Act. "Provisions were made to easily adapt Circular A-133 to include
state and local governments if the Single Audit Act is amended," OMB said in the
preamble to the revision. Once those amendments are enacted, OMB will rescind
Circular A-128 and revise certain A-133 terminology to reflect that it will apply
to all non-federal entities spending federal funds, said Norwood Jackson Jr.,
deputy controller of OMB's Office of Federal Financial Management, speaking at
the 11th Biennial Forum for Governmental Auditors held in Seattle last month.<P>

<h3>Determining Major Programs, Audit Coverage</h3><P>

To determine major programs, auditors will follow a series of steps using both
dollar thresholds and risk-based criteria (see chart below). "Type A" programs
will be those exceeding:<P>

<UL> <LI>$300,000 or 3 percent of federal expenditures when all federal
expenditures total $100 million or less;<P>

<LI>$3 million or .3 percent of federal expenditures when all such expenditures
are more than $100 million but are less than or equal to $10 billion; or<P>

<LI>$30 million or .15 percent of federal expenditures when all such expenditures
are greater than $10 billion.</UL><P>

Programs under these dollar thresholds will be called "Type B" programs. Type A
programs that are deemed to be low-risk will not have to be audited unless needed
to ensure that 50 percent of the entity's total federal expenditures are covered
by the audit. A program could qualify as low-risk if it has been audited as a
major program at least once during the past two audit periods under the new
circular and had no findings in the most recent audit period. However, OMB gives
auditors discretion in deciding whether findings from questioned costs, fraud and
follow-up from prior audit findings "do not preclude the Type A program from
being low-risk." <P>

Type B programs will only have to be audited if they are identified as high-risk,
or if necessary to comply with the 50 percent rule. Auditors are expected to use
"professional judgment" in assessing a program's or entity's risk. Circular A-133
lists numerous factors that can affect risk and notes that some factors should
weigh more heavily than others. Potential indications of a high-risk program
include findings from previous audits, weak internal controls, weak systems for
monitoring subrecipients, new or recently modified computer systems, grantor
agencies' discovery of problems, new programs or new program rules, or the entity
is a new federal grantee. <P>

Two general rules apply in deciding how many programs must be audited. No more
high-risk Type B programs must be audited than the number of low-risk Type A
programs identified by the auditor. In other words, the number of programs
audited under a risk-based approach may be no more than the number of programs
audited under the dollar thresholds. However, the 50 percent rule overrides this
cap on the number of programs audited. The required coverage of federal
expenditures must be met regardless of the number of high-risk Type B or low-risk
Type A programs identified. If the auditee as a whole is assessed as low-risk,
then the mandatory coverage is lowered to 25 percent.<P>

An auditee may be deemed as low-risk, and be eligible for 25 percent coverage of
federal expenditures, if they meet other criteria, such as receiving unqualified
opinions on their financial statements and schedule of expenditures of federal
awards, and having no material weaknesses in internal controls.<P>

In addition, a federal agency or pass-through grantee can request that a program
be audited as major and pay the full incremental cost of covering that program.
Auditors can defer implementing a risk-based approach the first year an entity is
audited under the revised circular. The one-year grace period also applies to the
first year an auditor audits a particular entity, but an auditee that changes
auditors frequently cannot use the deferment more than once every three years.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/fed_gts/sass/sassjune1a.gif" alt="This chart is entitled Deciding Which
Federal Programs Must Be Audited As Major Programs Under the Revised
A-133"></center></IMG><P>

<h3>Changes to Audit Procedures, Requirements</h3><P>

The new Circular A-133 impacts how much testing is required, how many
expenditures are covered, and how auditors must report questioned costs and
compliance issues. The reporting package must include:<P>

<UL> <LI>a certification by the auditee that includes summary information on the
types of reports and opinions issued, the auditee's federal programs and
expenditures amounts, and yes or no statements on the kinds of findings and
questioned costs reported;<P>

<LI>financial statements and a schedule of expenditures of federal awards
(re-termed from schedule of federal awards);<P>

<LI>a summary schedule of prior audit findings;<P>

<LI>auditor's reports that include an opinion on financial statements and
schedule of expenditures of federal awards, a report on internal controls, a
report on compliance, and a schedule of findings and questioned costs that
includes a summary of the auditor's results; and<P>

<LI>a corrective action plan.</UL><P>

As is currently the case, the audit report must be sent to the Federal Audit
Clearinghouse. The report must be sent to federal agencies or pass-through
entities only when findings or prior audit findings relate to federal awards
provided by that agency or entity. Management letters do not have to be included
in the reporting package, but must be available to federal agencies or
pass-through entities if requested.<P>

The reporting package includes some new elements, such as the audit report
summary and auditee certification. Additionally, the schedule of expenditures of
federal awards should "include notes that describe the significant accounting
policies used in preparing the schedule" and state the dollar threshold used in
identifying Type A and Type B programs.<P>

In addition, the report on compliance must include an opinion on whether the
auditee complied with "laws, regulations and the provisions of contracts or grant
agreements which could have a direct and material effect on each major program."
Audit guidance currently in effect requires only a positive or negative assurance
on compliance. Jackson said that auditors will not have to give an opinion on
compliance with drug-free workplace and other general requirements that do not
have a direct and material effect on major programs. The new requirement instead
will focus auditors' testing on "the stuff that if you don't comply with it, it's
serious business ... whether it be eligibility or allowability of costs," he
said.<P>

As noted above, the 50 percent rule is codified in the new circular. Whereas
AICPA and OMB guidance had applied the rule to testing controls over federal
financial assistance programs, the new A-133 extends the required 50 percent
coverage to everything in the audit, including compliance testing. Auditors are
required to "audit as major programs federal programs with expenditures that, in
the aggregate, encompass at least 50 percent of total federal expenditures," the
circular states. <P>

The circular requires auditors to plan the testing of internal controls over
major programs to achieve a low assessed level of control risk. "All CPA
commenters and over half of the state auditor commenters opposed the proposed
requirement," saying that "it increases the amount of audit work, limits [the]
auditors' judgment and is arbitrary," according to OMB. In its preamble, OMB
emphasized that the new requirement only applies to the planning of testing; if
an auditor finds control exceptions, he or she does not have to continue testing
until a low level of risk is achieved. Instead, inadequate internal controls
should be reported as a reportable condition or material weakness, and the
related control risk should be assessed at the maximum level.<P>

The purpose of the requirement is to ensure that more than just one or two
transactions are tested, Jackson told conference attendees. Under the Single
Audit Act, "it was never intended to have such a <i>de minimis</i> level of
testing involved in meeting the requirements of the law," he said.<P>

OMB added more specific guidance for auditors on reporting audit findings and set
a $10,000 threshold for reporting questioned costs. "This business of every
little thing having to be reported is going down the tubes," Jackson said.
Auditors also are required to report known questioned costs that are $10,000 or
less when likely questioned costs are projected to be greater than $10,000 for a
type of compliance requirement for a major program. The circular tells auditors
to provide information to help report readers judge "the prevalence and
consequences of the questioned costs."<P>

<h3>Program-Specific Audits</h3><P>

The revised A-133 offers more flexibility to permit program-specific audits. A
program-specific audit is allowed when a grantee spends federal awards under only
one program and the recipient is not otherwise required to have a financial
statement audit. However, "federal program" is redefined so that all federal
awards made from one agency for the same purpose should be considered one
program. Likewise, states can combine funding for similar federal programs in
making awards to subrecipients. Therefore, an entity expending funds under
programs with the same compliance requirements may be eligible to have a
program-specific audit.<P>

In addition, institutions receiving research and development awards can have a
program-specific audit if those awards are from the same federal agency (and
pass-through entity, if applicable) and a program-specific audit is approved in
advance. <P>

<h3>Audits of Subrecipients</h3><P>

The revised circular spells out OMB's expectations for pass-through entities'
monitoring of subrecipients. OMB stated in the preamble that "both the
pass-through entity and the pass-through entity's auditors have responsibilities
for these funds even when an audit of the subrecipient is not required." Primary
recipients may need to do additional monitoring, and their auditors "will need to
consider obtaining compliance assurances by reviewing the pass-through entity's
records and monitoring procedures, performing additional procedures to determine
compliance, such as testing the subrecipient's records, or a combination of
procedures," OMB said. <P>

All entities spending less than $300,000 in federal funds are exempt from A-133's
audit requirements. At the audit conference, Jackson emphasized that any
pass-through agency imposing a single audit on subrecipients under that threshold
would not have those audit costs reimbursed by the federal government unless a
single audit was required by state law. "You can't expect to bill the federal
government for something the federal government didn't impose," he said.<P>

Instead, OMB hopes that pass-through entities will use a "surgical audit
approach" to monitoring small grantees. "The way you do that, instead of having a
full-blown single audit that might cost you $10,000 or $15,000, is to arrange
[with a CPA firm or state auditor] for agreed-upon procedures to be performed ...
to ensure that certain critical compliance requirements are being adhered to," he
said. <P>

Under agreed-upon procedures, the grantor agency can still disallow costs and
collect those funds from the grantee, Jackson said. And because the arrangement
would constitute program monitoring, the costs of having agreed-upon procedures
performed would be reimbursable under federal grants and contracts, he added.
Neither Circular A-133 nor the Single Audit Act amendments proposed specify
agreed-upon procedures as a required monitoring tool. <P>

<h3>Restrictions on Auditor Selection</h3><P>

In response to federal agency concerns about auditors' independence, OMB Circular
A-133 now restricts auditors (and their accounting firms) who prepare cost
allocation plans, indirect cost proposals or disclosure statements required by
Circular A-21 for an entity from performing an A-133 audit for the same entity.
Since many grantees and auditors opposed the proposal, the final version aims to
restrict auditor selection only for the largest grantees.<P>

Instead of setting the threshold as a percentage of expenditures, as was
proposed, grantees have to comply with the provision if they recovered more than
$1 million in indirect costs during the year prior to the year to be audited. An
OMB official said about 200 colleges and universities and 150 non-profits would
be affected by the rule. <P>

When a grantee has a multi-year indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan,
the restriction applies to the base year used in the preparation of those
documents and any years after in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or
allocation plan is used to recover costs. "We want the auditor to be independent
of the base year and the years where that [agreement] is used," the official
said.<P>

The restriction will not apply to auditors who prepare a university's disclosure
statements required under Circular A-21 (see story, page 1). The provision
applies to fiscal years ending on or after June 30, 1999. OMB said the effective
date is delayed two years to give auditees time to switch auditors if needed.<P>

<h3>Other Provisions of A-133</h3><P>

The deadline for submitting audit reports was shortened from 13 months to nine
months after the end of the period audited. Even if the reports are completed
before then, they should be submitted to the clearinghouse 30 days after the
auditor issues the report to the grantee. The deadline can be extended if agreed
to in advance by the federal cognizant or oversight agency for audit.<P>

Although OMB had floated the idea of triennial audits for low-risk auditees, that
idea was not adopted. Audits must be performed annually for all recipients.
However, federal or pass-through agencies can allow recipients having
program-specific audits to undergo audits every two years, with the audit
covering both years. OMB also had suggested requiring a management assertion and
auditor attestation for internal controls or compliance. The proposal was
dropped, as the majority of commenters felt "it would impose additional
requirements on entity management and increase audit costs," OMB said. The
revised circular is included in this month's supplement and can be electronically

<title>CONUS Per Diem Rates Increase for 1997</title>
</head>
<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

 Complying with IRS Employee Benefits Rules"></center>

<h2> CONUS Per Diem Rates Increase for 1997</h2>
<h2><i>Both Standard Lodging and M&amp;IE Rates Revised Upward</h2></i><P>
The General Services Administration (GSA) has significantly increased the federal
per diem rates for travel in the continental United States (CONUS).<P>
For the first time since 1993, the four CONUS meal and incidental expense
(M&amp;IE) rates have increased across the board -- from $26, $30, $32 and $38 in
1996, to $30, $32, $38 and $42 in 1997.<P>
The GSA also has increased the standard CONUS lodging rate, from $40 in 1996, to
$50 in 1997.<P>
The CONUS per diem rates became effective for employee travel as of Jan. 1, 1997.
The complete rate schedule appeared in the Nov. 21, 1996, Federal Register.<P>
<h3>Tax Treatment of Employee Travel Allowances</h3><P>
The federal per diem rates serve as reference points for determining the maximum
excludable per diem allowance an employer may provide to an employee or
independent contractor traveling to a particular location. An employer is not
required to report as compensation any per diem allowance equal to or less than
the federal per diem rate set for that location. An employer, however, must
report as compensation the portion of any per diem allowance exceeding the
proscribed federal rate. The employer also must withhold payroll taxes, including
income, FICA and FUTA taxes, on any excess allowances.<P>
Although the higher 1997 CONUS rates increase the per diem amounts employees may
exclude from income, employers' corresponding deductions for business travel
expenses will not increase as substantially. Code Section 274(n) disallows
employers from deducting 50 percent of the M&amp;IE portion of any per diem
allowance. <P>
Consequently, the payroll tax savings that employers will realize from the
increased rates sometimes will not completely offset the associated reduction to
the corporate income tax deduction stemming from the 50-percent disallowance.<P>
Some employers have challenged the disallowance of the incidental expense portion
of the M&amp;IE rate, especially when such incidental expenses, as defined under
the Federal Travel Regulations, do not encompass meal or entertainment expenses
-- two types of expenses Section 274(n) explicitly governs. The IRS, however, has
not yet modified the disallowance's application to CONUS per diem allowances.<P>
<h3>Reading the Rates</h3><P>
The 1997 CONUS per diem rate schedule lists 500 locations in the continental
United States, down from 667 locations in 1996. For each location, the rate
schedule provides one of the four M&amp;IE rates ($30, $32, $38 or $42), and a
lodging rate ranging from $50 to $189. <P>
The 1997 M&amp;IE rates for many previously listed locations shifted upward due
to the across-the-board $4 M&amp;IE rate increase and $10 lodging rate increase,
as well as to annual cost fluctuations. This year's rate schedule breaks down
into the following groups:<P>
<UL>
<LI>There are now 37 locations assigned the $42 M&amp;IE rate. Because this rate
did not exist before this year, no locations were assigned the $42 rate in
1996.<P>
<LI>There are now 79 locations assigned the $38 M&amp;IE rate, up from the 52
locations in 1996.<P>
<LI>There are now 154 locations assigned the $34 M&amp;IE rate, down from 238
locations in 1996.<P>
<LI>There are now 230 locations assigned the $30 M&amp;IE rate, down from 275
locations in 1996.<P>
<LI>Because the GSA eliminated the $26 rate, no locations were assigned this rate
for 1997.<P></UL>
Like the 230 locations assigned the $30 rate for 1997, all locations not listed
on the CONUS schedule have a $30 M&amp;IE rate; the locations actually specified
in the $30 category appear in the schedule because their lodging rates exceed the
$50 minimum rate.<P>
For the first time, the rate schedule includes New Orleans among the highest-rate
cities; it still does not include Philadelphia, however, which now is assigned
the $38 rate, up from $34 in 1996. Both Dallas/Fort Worth and Miami, after
shifting into the highest rate category last year ($38), remain in the
highest-rate category for 1997 ($42).<P>
<h3>Varying Lodging Costs</h3><P>
The CONUS rate schedule also provides per diem rates combining the lodging and
M&amp;IE rates for all 500 locations. The GSA developed these "combined rates"
because of the significant variances in lodging costs around the country.<P>
All locations in the continental United States not listed in the CONUS per diem
rate schedule are assigned an $80 combined rate, reflecting a $50 lodging
allowance and a $30 M&amp;IE allowance.<P>
For 1997, the combined rates covering lodging and M&amp;IE expenses for all
listed locations range from $80 for many locations, to $195 for New York City
($42 for M&amp;IE expenses and $153 for lodging). In 1996, the combined rates
ranged from $67 to $180.<P>
For 1997, the combined rates for certain seasonal locations range from the same
low of $80 to $223. In 1996, the combined seasonal rates ranged from $67 to
$204.<P>
<h3>Seasonal Price Hikes</h3><P>
Since 1994, the CONUS rate schedule has included both in-season and off-season
rates for some locations. These different seasonal rates apply during
GSA-designated periods only, and generally follow locations' popularity with
vacationers. Only the lodging allowances and, in turn, the combined rates of the
seasonal rates fluctuate. The M&amp;IE rates for these locations, however, remain
constant throughout the year.<P>
For example, for Vail, Colo., the lodging rate is $181 from Nov. 1 through March
31, and $89 from April 1 through Oct. 31. Its M&amp;IE rate, however, is $42
during both periods. Vail is assigned the highest lodging rate in the continental
United States during its in-season period; Martha's Vineyard/Nantucket has the
second highest in-season lodging rate at $179.<P>
<h3>IRS High-Low Rates Not Yet Available</h3><P>
Each year, the IRS issues a schedule of high-low per diem rates that employers
may use instead of the CONUS per diem rates. The high-low rates can simplify
determining the combined per diem rates for CONUS locations, and in some cases,
allow employers to provide higher per diem allowances than allowed under the
CONUS schedule.<P>
The IRS, however, had not yet issued its high-low rates at the time this issue of
Current Developments went to print in late December.

<Title> Revised Circular A-21 Includes Cost Accounting Standards</Title> <P>

<body background="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif> 
<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/fed_gts/gran/granhead.gif" alt="Federal Grants Management

<h2> Revised Circular A-21 Includes Cost Accounting Standards</h2>

<body>
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued final revisions to Circular
A-21, <i>Cost Principles for Educational Institutions </i>, that apply certain cost
accounting standards to universities and modify requirements for
facilities-related costs. <P>

The revision, published in the May 8 <i>Federal Register </i>, implements most of the
provisions proposed by OMB in February 1995, but ideas floated for benchmarking
facilities and utilities costs were not included in the final circular. OMB plans
to issue a formal proposal for handling facilities-related costs in the coming
year.<P>

The most significant changes to the circular include: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Extending certain cost accounting standards (CAS) to educational
institutions and requiring institutions receiving more than $25 million in
federal awards to file a disclosure statement of their accounting practices;<P>

<LI>Requiring the same indirect cost rates (which the circular now calls
facilities and administrative cost rates) to be used throughout the life of a
sponsored agreement;<P>

<LI>Establishing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the
Office of Naval Research (ONR) as the only two cost cognizant agencies;<P>

<LI>Prohibiting as of July 1, 1998, the use of special cost studies to allocate
utility, library and student services costs;<P>

<LI>Reversing the allowability of dependent tuition benefits;<P>

<LI>Adding requirements and restrictions for allowing interest costs;<P>

<LI>Revising how institutions change from a use allowance to depreciation
methodology; and<P>

<LI>Raising the equipment threshold to $5,000. </UL><P>

Most provisions took effect May 8. However, the effective date for applying the
new cost accounting standards and required disclosure varies. Also, the ban on
using special studies for cost allocation is delayed for two years.<P>

<h3>Applying Cost Accounting Standards to Grants</h3><P>

After nearly unanimous opposition by university commenters, OMB decided to apply
certain standards issued by the Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) to all
sponsored agreements with institutions of higher education. CASB already has
applied some standards to contracts with colleges and universities, but the
changes to A-21 extend these standards to all types of awards.<P>

The standards reiterate many principles -- such as consistency in accounting
practices and treatment of direct and indirect costs -- that are already
articulated in Circular A-21. However, the requirements give more detail,
including examples of applying the standards, than A-21 previously provided. The
circular applies the standards to universities' fiscal years beginning on or
after May 8, 1996. <P>

The four CAS being incorporated into Circular A-21 are:<P>

<UL>
<LI>CAS 9905.501 -- Consistency in estimating, accumulating and reporting costs
by educational institutions;<P>

<LI>CAS 9905.502 -- Consistency in allocating costs incurred for the same
purpose by educational institutions;<P>

<LI>CAS 9905.505 -- Accounting for unallowable costs -- educational
institutions; and<P>

<LI>CAS 9905.506 -- Cost accounting period -- educational institutions.</UL><P>

All colleges and universities will be subject to these CAS. Institutions
receiving $25 million or more in sponsored agreements must disclose on form DS-2
how they account for all costs charged to federal awards and identify unallowable
costs in cost proposals and billings. The form is 20 pages long, but further
explanation that is requested for several types of answers would make the
submission significantly longer. For example, OMB asks educational institutions
for descriptions of systems for identifying and accounting for unallowable costs,
organizational structures, post-retirement benefit plans and costs, and other
practices. When institutions use more than one accounting method to handle a
certain type of cost, additional information also must be supplied. <P>

OMB had proposed staggered deadlines for submitting the disclosure, with
universities that received fewer funds having more time. The revised circular,
however, imposes the same time frame for all institutions. For entities not
already covered by CASB's regulations for contracts with institutions (which were
issued Nov. 8, 1994, and took effect Jan. 9, 1995), the form must be submitted
six months after the end of an institution's fiscal year beginning on or after
May 8, 1996. Cognizant agencies can grant extensions.<P>

College and university commenters felt that the additional standards were
duplicative of existing requirements in Circular A-21, and that the disclosure
statement would increase administrative burdens of universities that were already
subject to a cap in federal reimbursements for administrative costs. OMB said in
the preamble to the circular that "the four CAS are being incorporated since they
provide more explicit provisions and guidance regarding the consistent
application of cost accounting practices at educational institutions." Since
institutions already must comply with A-21 and document their financial
management practices in accordance with Circular A-110, administrative
requirements for completing form DS-2 will only be highly burdensome if "a
university does not currently have adequate written cost accounting
practices."<P>

The complete form must be submitted only once. Changes to cost accounting
practices must be disclosed through amendments to the original form. If the
change "is expected to have a material impact on the ... negotiated facilities
and administrative cost rates," the revised practice must be approved by the
cognizant agency.<P>

While no materiality thresholds were set for what changes would warrant amending
an institution's DS-2 form, an OMB official said insignificant accounting changes
or changes to a single award generally would not need to be reported on the form
unless an institution's cost rates were affected. "The determination of whether
an accounting change is significant and, therefore, requires an amendment to the
DS-2 and possibly a cost impact proposal is to be made by the cognizant agency,"
OMB stated in the preamble. OMB also tried to alleviate institutions' concerns
that CASB and OMB could give conflicting interpretations of the new requirements.
OMB's Office of Federal Financial Management, which has more experience than CASB
in dealing with colleges and universities, will address all federal agencies'
inquiries about the standards, an OMB official said. <P>

<h3>Cost Allocation and Negotiation Issues</h3><P>

OMB made several other changes to Circular A-21 that could affect rates used by
institutions. Notably, the circular now requires that facilities and
administrative cost rates in use at the time of the award of a sponsored
agreement be used throughout the life of that agreement. (The circular now uses
the term "facilities and administrative costs" rather than "indirect costs,"
although the cost accounting standards described above still use the term
"indirect costs.") The rationale for fixing the rate applied to an agreement, OMB
said, was that "it is only fair for the federal government to commit funding and
reimbursement based on the conditions as they are understood to exist at that
time" that an agreement is initially made.<P>

The provision defines the "life" of the sponsored agreement as each "competitive
segment," or the period of years set by the federal funding agency at the time
the award is made. In cases where an institution has a provisional rate pending
the establishment of a negotiated rate with the federal government, the
provisional rate will be adjusted once the negotiated rate is approved.<P>

Fixing the rates applied to specific awards could especially impact National
Science Foundation (NSF) grantees. Historically, NSF has capped the total funding
(including direct and indirect costs) for a specific project during the life of
the award. Therefore, an institution with rising facilities and administrative
cost rates could shift some funding from direct to indirect costs to cover the
increase. The new Circular A-21 requires NSF to change its policy so that the
rate freeze will apply only to the indirect costs of the project. <P>

OMB also reassigned cost cognizance to two agencies -- HHS and ONR. As of July 1,
1996, Circular A-88, <i>Indirect Cost Rates, Audits and Audit Follow-up at
Educational Institutions </i>, is rescinded. However, cognizant agency assignments
effective as of Dec. 31, 1995, will remain the same through the latter of
institutions' fiscal years ending during 1997, or the period covered by
negotiated agreements in effect on Dec. 31, 1995. After that time, cognizance
will revert to HHS or ONR, depending on which agency has awarded an institution
more funds for the past three years. If a school receives funding from neither
agency, HHS will have cost cognizance.<P>

Cognizant agency assignments will stay the same for a five-year period. The
circular also spells out that negotiated rates must be accepted by all federal
agencies unless "special circumstances, when required by law or regulation,"
compel an agency to use a different rate for a class of sponsored agreements or a
single agreement.<P>

<h3>Tuition Benefits, Special Cost Studies</h3><P>

Dependent tuition benefits will no longer be an allowable cost under the revised
circular. This provision takes effect for fiscal years starting on or after Sept.
30, 1998. OMB said in the preamble to the revisions that this change was made to
bring the circular more in line with cost principles for state and local
governments, non-profits organizations and the Federal Acquisition Regulations,
which do not allow these costs. Many institutions had opposed this change,
arguing that dependent tuition benefits helped schools compete with commercial
firms in recruiting personnel.<P>

The costs associated with using special studies to determine utility, library and
student services cost allocations will be disallowed for indirect (administrative
and facilities) rates negotiated on or after July 1, 1998. By then, OMB plans to
have an alternative method in place to determine these rates (see March 1996
<i>Current Developments </i>, page 1). <P>

OMB expects to issue a proposal addressing alternatives by July 1, 1997. If an
institution's rate agreement in effect on May 8, 1996, extends beyond 1998, the
ban on using special cost studies will start at the end of that rate agreement
period.<P>

<h3>Facilities and Equipment Costs</h3><P>

As it did with revisions to Circular A-87, <i>Cost Principles for State, Local and
Indian Tribal Governments </i>, OMB added a provision to require institutions
converting from the use allowance to the depreciation method for cost recovery of
assets to make the conversion "as if the depreciation method had been used over
the entire life of the asset." (See July 1995 <i>Current Developments </i>, page 1, for
information about this provision in Circular A-87.)<P>

The circular further clarifies that a combination of use allowance and
depreciation may not be used, in like circumstances, for a single class of
assets. "This provision prevents an educational institution from both using
depreciation to recover the cost of assets with useful lives that are shorter
than the average lives reflected in the use allowance rates (50 years for
buildings and 15 years for equipment) and using allowance for the recovery of
assets with longer useful lives," OMB said.<P>

<h3>Interest Allowability </h3><P>

In another move to promote conformity among the cost principles, OMB adopted a
provision included in Circular A-122, <i>Cost Principles for Non-Profit
Organizations</i>, that requires preparation of a lease purchase analysis for
facilities costing more than $500,000. The analysis, which is a comparison of the
costs associated with purchasing a facility versus leasing it, must be done in
accordance with OMB Circular A-110. <P>

Regardless of which option an institution chooses, interest reimbursement will be
limited to the least expensive arrangement, OMB stated. "These requirements are
needed to protect the federal government against abusive financing arrangements
(such as 'balloon financing method' where the entire principal amount is [paid]
at the end of the finance term)."<P>

The circular also requires universities to prepare a cash-flow analysis for debt
arrangements over $1 million, unless the educational institution makes an initial
equity contribution to the asset purchase of 25 percent or more, OMB said. If the
equity contribution is less, the institution must "reduce claims for interest
cost by an amount equal to imputed interest earnings on excess cash flow."
Additionally, the circular requires that cognizant agencies be notified of any
substantial relocation from a federally funded building.<P>

Probably the least controversial change to the circular is the revised definition
of "equipment". As such, the circular defines "equipment" as "an article of
nonexpendable, tangible personal property having a useful life of more than one
year and an acquisition cost which equals or exceeds the lesser of the
capitalization level established by the organization for financial statement
purposes or $5,000." OMB already had been allowing cognizant agencies to waive
the previous $500 threshold.<P>

The revised circular is included in this month's supplement (Appendix I).

<h2> 84.010 Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies (Title 1 Basic,
Concentration, and Targeted Grants)</h2>

<body>
<P>

<h3>FEDERAL AGENCY:</h3> <P>

OFFICE OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION<P>

<h3>AUTHORIZATION:</h3> <P>

Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, Title I, Part A, 20 U.S.C. 2701
et seq.<P>

<h3>OBJECTIVES:</h3><P>

To improve the education opportunities of educationally deprived children by
helping them succeed in the regular school program, attain grade level
proficiency, and improve achievement in basic and more advanced skills.<P>

<h3>USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:</h3><P>

Primarily for provision of instructional activities to educationally deprived
children that reside in low-income areas and have been selected on the basis of a
needs assessment. Services must supplement, not supplant, those normally provided
by State and local educational agencies.<P>

*<i><b>SUGGESTED AUDIT PROCEDURES:</b> <P>

State Education Agency (SEA)<P>

<UL>
<LI>Review the policies and procedures used by SEA for the review of local
education agency (LEA) applications for chapter 1 funds.<P>

<LI>Test a sample of LEA applications to determine if LEA chapter 1 applications
include the information and assurances contained in the statute and regulations
and were reviewed by SEA.<P>
</UL>

<i>Local Education Agency</i><P>

<UL>
<LI>Identify the activities in the LEA-approved project application.<P>

<LI>Test expenditure and related records to determine whether chapter 1 funds
were used only for allowable services.<P>
</UL></i>

<h3>ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:</h3><P>

<b>Applicant Eligibility:</b> State educational agencies (SEAs) and the Secretary of the
Interior may apply. Local educational agencies (LEAs) and Indian tribal schools
are subgrantees.<P>

<b>Beneficiary Eligibility:</b> Educationally deprived children living in low-income
areas that are selected to participate by LEAs.<P>

*<i>An LEA chapter 1 project must be based on an annual assessment of educational
needs that (1) identifies educationally deprived children in all eligible areas;
(2) identifies the general instructional areas on which the program will focus;
(3) selects those educationally deprived children who have the greatest need for
special assistance, as identified on the educationally related objective criteria
established by the LEA that are uniformly applied to particular grade levels
throughout the LEA; and (4) determines the special educational needs and library
resource needs of participating children with specificity to ensure concentration
on such needs. (Sec. 1014(b), 34 CFR 200.31)<P>

With certain exceptions, an LEA must use funds only for children whose
educational attainment is below the level that is appropriate for children of
their age (educationally deprived children). An LEA must conduct chapter 1
projects in schools attendance areas having high concentrations of children from
low income families. If funds are insufficient to provide programs in all
eligible areas, the LEA must annually rank its areas from highest to lowest
within each grade-span grouping or for the entire LEA according to the degree of
concentration of children from low income families.

**(Note: chapter 1 funds
may be used to benefit all students at schools participating in a schoolwide
project (34 CFR 200.36).)<P>

*<b>SUGGESTED AUDIT PROCEDURES:</b><P>

LEA<P>

<UL>
<LI>Review the annual assessment of educational needs for completeness as it
relates to the four areas stated in the compliance requirement.<P>

<LI>Review LEA procedures used for determining school attendance areas having
high concentrations of children from low income families and evaluate for
adequacy.<P>

<LI>Identify the source of the demographic information and consider its
reliability.<P>

<LI>Identify the schools in which chapter 1 projects are being conducted, and
determine whether those schools serve attendance areas having high concentrations
of low income families selected in accordance with the implementing
regulations.<P>

<LI>On a sample test basis, determine that the children served are educationally
deprived.<P>
</UL></i>

<h3>ASSISTANCE CONSIDERATIONS:</h3><P>

<b>Formula and Matching Requirements:</b> The formula for allocating Basic Grants,
targeted assistance grants, and concentration grants are in Title I of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended. Basic Grants are
allocated to counties by formula, based on a State's per pupil expenditure for
education and the number of school-aged children from low-income families. States
in turn make sub-county allocations to school districts using the best available
data on the number of low- income children. Concentration Grants are allocated to
counties and LEAs having at least 6,500 children from low-income families or a
poverty rate of at least 15 percent. In cases where counties and LEAs qualify
under the 15 percent poverty rate threshold, the statute requires all children
from low-income families to be counted for allocation purposes; in counties and
LEAs that qualify only under the 6,500 children threshold, only low-income
children in excess of that number are counted. Targeted assistance grants also
target funds to countries with higher numbers or percentages of poor children.
The law also provides a minimum State allocation for Basic and Concentration
Grants. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Outlying Areas, and the Pacific Regional
Education Laboratory receive funding for basic grants. Within LEAs, school
officials target funds to schools with the greatest numbers of poor children.
Although Basic Grants and Concentration Grants are allocated to LEAs through
different formulas, school districts combine these funds for use as a single
program. There is no matching requirement. This program has maintenance of effort
(MOE) requirements; see funding agency for further details.<P>

the types of expenditures included in LEA calculations are appropriate, that they
are consistent from year to year and that the level of effort is maintained.<P>

<LI>Review the waivers granted by SEA and determine whether the basis for
waiving was for authorized purposes.<P>

<LI>Ascertain whether SEA is monitoring each LEA's compliance with the
comparability requirements.<P>
</UL>

LEA<P>

<UL>
<LI>Review the second and first preceding years' financial and related records
of LEA, determine total expenditures, and if appropriate review the second and
first preceding years' pupil records of LEA and determine per-pupil
expenditures.<P>

<LI>Determine if effort was maintained.<P>

<LI>Evaluate the adequacy of the system to ensure that federal funds are used to
supplement, not supplant, non-federal funds.<P>

<LI>Test the system to determine whether the grantee used chapter 1 funds to
supplant non-federal funds.<P>
</UL></i>

<b>Length and Time Phasing of Assistance:</b> Assistance is provided for one fiscal
year. No more than 15 percent of unspent funds may be carried forward into the
next fiscal year. Funds are released under the Electronic Transfer System in as
close proximity to need as possible.<P>

<h3>REPORTING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS:</h3><P>

<b>Reports:</b> States submit annual performance reports.<P>

*<i>Each year, an SEA must submit its average state per pupil expenditure (SPPE)
data to the National Center for Education Statistics. SPPE data are reported on
the Common Core of Data Survey, Revenues and Expenditures for Public Elementary
and Secondary Education (SPPE survey). SPPE data comprise the annual current
state expenditures for free public education, less certain designated exclusions,
divided by the state's average daily attendance ("current expenditures" is
defined in section 1471 of chapter 1 of title I of ESEA). SPPE data are used for
the allocation of chapter 1 funds. Current expenditures to be included are those
for free public education, including administration, instruction, attendance,
health services, pupil transportation services, operation and maintenance of
plant, and fixed charges and net expenditures to cover deficits for food services
and student body activities. Current expenditures to be excluded are those for
community services, capital outlay, debt service and expenditures from chapter 1
and chapter 2 funds. (20 U.S.C. 2711, 2891(b))<P>

<b>SUGGESTED AUDIT PROCEDURES:</b><P>

SEA<P>

<UL>
<LI>Review the most recent annual SPPE survey, compare it with supporting
documentation maintained by SEA and determine whether they are consistent.<P>

<LI>Review the SPPE survey to determine whether (1) only appropriate current
expenditures are included, (2) expenditures are double counted and (3) the
average daily attendance reported was in accordance with state law.<P>
</UL></i>

<b>Records:</b> In accordance with the General Education Provisions Act, and the
Education Department General Administration regulations, States must maintain
certain program records for five years.<P>

*<i><b>SPECIAL TESTS AND PROVISIONS:</b><P>

An LEA may not carry over more than 15 percent of basic and concentration grant
funds appropriated for each fiscal year. The percentage limitations do not apply
to an LEA that receives less than $50,000 for any fiscal year.<P>

SEA may grant a one-time waiver of the percentage limitation if SEA determines
that the request is reasonable and necessary. SEA may also grant a waiver in any
fiscal year in which supplemental appropriations for chapter 1 become available
for obligation. <P>

<b>SUGGESTED AUDIT PROCEDURE:</b><P>

LEA<P>

<UL>
<LI>
Determine whether LEA has carried over no more than the percentage specified
in the law.<P>
</UL>

An LEA shall develop and implement programs, activities, and procedures for the
involvement of parents in the chapter 1 program that meet the goals and
requirements specified in section 1016 of chapter 1. <P>

<b>SUGGESTED AUDIT PROCEDURES:</b><P>

<UL>
<LI>Determine whether LEA has, in consultation with parents of participating
children, developed programs, activities and procedures to involve parents and
whether LEA has written policies concerning parent involvement.<P>

<LI>Determine whether LEA is implementing its policies and procedures.<P>
</UL>

For children enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools who are
educationally deprived and who reside in chapter 1 project areas, an LEA must
provide chapter 1 services and arrangements that are equitable to those provided
for children enrolled in public schools. Services are equitable if LEA:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Assesses, addresses and evaluates the specific needs and educational
progress of eligible private school children on the same basis as public school
children;<P>

<LI>Provides, in the aggregate, approximately the same amount of instructional
time and materials for each private school child as it provides for each public
school child;<P>

<LI>Expends equal amounts on services for public and private school children in
accordance with section 1017(a); and<P>

<LI>Provides private school children with an opportunity to participate that is
equitable to the opportunity provided to public school  children.<P>
</UL>

If LEA provision of services and arrangements for private school children is
prohibited by state law or if the Secretary of Education determines that LEA
substantially failed to provide for the participation on an equitable basis of
eligible private school children, the Secretary of Education invokes a bypass to
have the services provided directly.<P>

<b>SUGGESTED AUDIT PROCEDURES:</b><P>

LEA<P>

<UL>
<LI>Review procedures for determining numbers and needs of educationally
deprived children in private schools, and evaluate for adequacy.<P>

<LI>Ascertain the chapter 1 services that LEA provided to private school
children, and determine whether LEA has provided the services on an equitable

<h2> 14.181 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities (811)</h2>

<body>
<h3>FEDERAL AGENCY:</h3>
HOUSING, DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT<P>

<h3>AUTHORIZATION:</h3>
National Affordable Housing Act, Public Law 101-625, 42 U.S.C.
8013, 104 Stat. 4324, 4331.<P>

<h3>OBJECTIVES:</h3>
To provide for supportive housing and related facilities for persons
with disabilities.<P>

<h3>USES AND USE RESTRICTIONS:</h3>
Capital advances may be used to finance the
construction or rehabilitation of supportive housing for persons with
disabilities, including the purchase of buildings with or without rehabilitation
for use as group homes. Project rental assistance is used to cover any part of
the HUD-approved operating costs of the facility that is not met from project
income.<P>

*<i>As a general rule, only the costs that have been or will be paid in cash within
45 days after the date of final endorsement or closing or are escrowed with the
mortgagee can be included in the mortgagor's or contractor's certificate of
actual cost. For projects with insured mortgages, direct loans and capital
advances, the mortgagor determines the cut-off date for the actual cost of
interest, taxes and mortgage insurance premium. This date may, at the earliest,
be the same date as the final completion date or, at the mortgagor's option, any
date in between. The date chosen as the cut-off date and the date to which the
operating statement and balance sheet are computed must be the same. The final
completion date is the date on which the HUD representative signs the final HUD
representative's trip report (Form HUD-5379) showing substantial completion. This
form must be properly endorsed by the field chief architect. HUD notifies the
mortgagor/borrower, the general contractor and the mortgagee of the date of
completion in writing. This date is the basis for establishing the cut-off date
for insured projects, direct loan projects and capital advance projects (HUD
Project 4470.2, Chapter 1). Eligible costs are those costs of the project
construction and certain fees paid in cash or that will be paid in cash within 45
days of final endorsement. HUD Handbooks 4470.1 REV-2, 4450.1 REV and 4470.2,
Chapter 2, contain information on allowable costs that must be reported on Form
HUD-92330 and the ways in which costs can be adjusted for items considered to be
a recovery of costs.<P>

<b><i>SUGGESTED AUDIT PROCEDURES:</b></i><P>

<UL>
<LI>Review the trip report (Form HUD-5379) or similar notification to determine
the final completion date.<P>

<LI>Review charges for time-sensitive expenses, such as interest, taxes and
mortgage and property insurance premiums, to determine that none were incurred
after the cut-off date.<P>

<LI>Review other amounts claimed on Form HUD-92330 to determine whether they
were claims for expenses paid in cash within 45 days after final closing. All
amounts claimed should be net of any adjustments or recoveries of costs.</i><P>
</UL>

<h3>ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:</h3><P>

<b>Applicant Eligibility</b>: Nonprofit corporations.<P>

<b>Beneficiary Eligibility</b>: Beneficiaries of housing developed under this program
must be very low income physically disabled, developmentally disabled or
chronically mentally ill persons (18 years of age or older).<P>

*<i>Where tenants or projects are subsidized, the owner is responsible for
accepting applications, correctly calculating the tenant's contribution toward
rent and utilities and any subsidy, determining initial tenant eligibility,
completing annual recertification of tenant eligibility and rectifying improper
or inaccurate tenant information in accordance with the guidelines provided in
HUD Handbook 4350.3 and the applicable housing assistance payments contract.<P>

<b><i>SUGGESTED AUDIT PROCEDURES:</b></i><P>

<UL>
<LI>Compare the owner's procedures for accepting applications, determining
initial eligibility, total tenant payment and re-examining eligibility with
provisions in HUD Handbook 4350.3.<P>

<LI>Review a sample of tenant files to determine whether: (1) applications are
complete and signed by the applicant; (2) tenants meet the eligibility
requirements pertaining to their subsidized unit for annual income and family
composition; (3) the tenant payment was calculated correctly; and (4) the family
income was re-examined on an annual basis. Include in the sample some of the
oldest and some of the most recently admitted tenants.<P>

<LI>Review a sample of tenant files to determine if the owner noted any
improper or inaccurate information while determining tenant eligibility or
recertifying tenants. If such information is noted, determine that the owner
followed the guidance in HUD Handbook 4350.3 pertaining to overpayment of a
subsidy and followed up on suspected fraud.<P>

<LI>Review a sample of tenant files to determine that the tenant file contains
the following documents: (1) application; (2) required verifications of social
security numbers, disability status, waiting list preferences and allowances for
adjusted income; (3) lease/lease addenda in the form as required by HUD; (4)
certification and recertification forms (Form HUD-50059); and (5) move-in and
move-out inspections.</i><P>
</UL>

<h3>ASSISTANCE CONSIDERATIONS:</h3><P>

<b>Formula and Matching Requirements</b>: This program has maintenance of effort (MOE)
requirements; see funding agency for further details. Statistical factors used
for fund allocation include a measure of the number of non-institutionalized
persons age 16 or older with a work disability and a mobility or self-care
limitation, and the number of non-institutionalized persons age 16 or older
having a mobility or self-care limitation but having no work disability from the
Census. Statistical factors used for eligibility do not apply for this
program.<P>

<b>Length and Time Phasing of Assistance</b>: The capital advance is not repayable if
the project is available for very low income persons with disabilities for 40
years. Project Rental Assistance Contract payments may not exceed 20 years.
Projects are expected to start construction within 18 months of the date of the
fund reservation, with limited provision for extensions. Funds will be advanced
on a monthly basis during construction for work in place.<P>

<h3>REPORTING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS:</h3><P>

<b>Reports</b>: Any change in the owner during the 40-year period must be approved by
HUD. All owners will be required to submit an annual financial statement to
HUD.<P>

*<i>Projects participating in HUD-assisted activities are required to ensure that
financial status reports contain reliable financial data and are presented in
accordance with the terms of applicable agreements between the entity and HUD.
The individual agreements contain the specific reporting requirements that the
entity must follow. <P>

<b>SUGGESTED AUDIT PROCEDURES:</b><P>

<UL>
<LI>Identify all required financial reports by inquiry of the owner/manager.<P>

<LI>Obtain an understanding of the auditee's procedures for preparing and
reviewing the financial reports.<P>

<LI>Select a sample of financial reports (other than those included in the
audited financial statements) and determine whether the reports selected were
prepared in accordance with HUD instructions.<P>

<LI>For the sample, trace significant data to supporting documentation, (i.e.,
worksheets, ledgers, etc.). Report all material differences between financial
reports and project records.<P>

<LI>Review significant adjustments made to the general ledger accounts
affecting HUD-assisted activities and evaluate the propriety.<P>
</UL>

Mortgagors and contractors involved in projects that receive HUD-insured loans,
direct loans and capital advances must maintain adequate records for the purpose
of determining the eligible costs associated with the projects (HUD Handbook
4470.2, Chapter 3).<P>

<b>SUGGESTED AUDIT PROCEDURES:</b><P>

<UL>
<LI>Obtain an understanding of the mortgagor's and contractor's accounting
system for identifying actual costs associated with a given project. Test the
system to determine that it identifies the costs to be reported on the Form
HUD-92330 on an individual project basis.<P>

<LI>Review Form HUD-92330 to determine whether it is complete and supported by
the accounting records.<P>

<LI>Trace significant data from Form HUD-92330 to supporting documentation
(i.e. worksheets, ledgers, etc.). Report all material differences between the
amounts reported on Form HUD-92330 and the supporting documents.<P>
</UL></i>

<b>Records</b>: Regular financial reports are required. Owners must service and maintain
records in accordance with acceptable mortgage practices and HUD regulations.
Owners also must supply those records necessary to indicate compliance with the
project rental assistance contract.<P>

*<i><b>SPECIAL TESTS AND PROVISIONS:</b><P>

Identity of Interest<P>

HUD Handbooks 4430.1 REV-1, 4470.1 REV-2 and 4470.2, Chapter 3 describe several
situations that are considered an identity of interest involving a mortgagor, a
contractor, a subcontractor or a materials supplier. Where an identity of
interest exists, the contractor must also submit a certificate of actual cost or
the party involved in the identity of interest as required by 4470.2, Chapter 3.
The contractor must submit a certificate of actual cost if a cost plus
construction contract was used. <P>

<b>SUGGESTED AUDIT PROCEDURES:</b><P>

<UL>
<LI>Review mortgagor and project records such as contracts and vendor invoices
to determine if an identity of interest exists between any of the parties
involved in the project, from mortgagors to contractors, suppliers and equipment
lessors.<P>

<LI>Where an identity of interest exists, determine that the additional
reporting requirements of HUD Handbook 4470.2 have been met.<P>

RE: Synthroid<BR>
Macimis ID #2380
</P>

<P>
Dear Dr. Ashworth:
</P>

<P>
This letter concerns Knoll Pharmaceuticals' (Knoll) promotional use of an article,<A HREF="#1">1</A> the "Berg/Mayor article," in Knoll's promotion of Synthroid (levothyroxine sodium). The Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications (DDMAC) has concluded that Knoll has violated the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. &#167;331(a) by misbranding Synthroid. Specifically, the reprints of the Berg/Mayor article, when disseminated by Knoll after Knoll received additional material information, were and are misleading labeling under 21 U.S.C. &#167;321(n) because the article fails to reveal facts that are material in light of other representations made or suggested by statement or word in the Berg/Mayor article.
</P>

<P>
The Berg/Mayor article reports a study designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic comparability of Synthroid and a competing levothyroxine product. The endpoints evaluated were the rate and extent of absorption over a relatively short period of time (less than one half-life), following supra-therapeutic doses of levothyroxine sodium. The authors of the article concluded that the measured endpoints were different between Synthroid and its competitor, and therefore the clinical pharmacokinetic profiles of the products were likely to be different from each other. Although the authors believed they had shown differences between the products, they noted that to show similarity, "a more complex design involving chronic administration in a well-controlled, hypothyroid population with the measurement of several endpoints" would be required.<A HREF="#2">2</A> 
</P>

<P>
In fact, since at least December of 1994, Knoll has been in possession of the results of a study with just such a more complex design involving chronic administration of thyroid replacement products in a hypothyroid population with the measurement of several endpoints, including thyroid stimulating hormone. This study, the "Dong study," was conducted by Dr. Betty Dong at the request of Knoll, and a manuscript reporting the results of the completed Dong study was accepted for publication by the Journal of the American Medical Association. Under pressure from Knoll, however, Dr. Dong withdrew the manuscript from publication. On its face, the manuscript from the Dong study contradicts the results of the Berg/Mayor study.
</P>

<P>
DDMAC has reviewed the manuscript of the Dong study, in consultation with FDA's Division of Endocrine and Metabolic Drug Products. Although we are unable to fully evaluate the data supporting the manuscript, we have concluded that the information is, at the very least, a material piece of information in the evolving scientific dialogue about the pharmacokinetic comparability of levothyroxine products, and specifically, the two products tested in the Berg/Mayor article.
</P>

<P>
Knoll should immediately cease dissemination of the Berg/Mayor article. Furthermore, because the agency is deeply concerned with the circumstances surrounding this issue, we invite you to meet with us in the near future to discuss our concerns. Knoll should respond to Patrick O'Brien, Regulatory Counsel, Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications, HFD-40, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, stating its intent to comply with our requests. Knoll's response should be submitted no later than November 22, 1996. In all future correspondence about this issue, please refer to MACMIS ID#2380.

<h2> Do It By Design</h2>

<b>An Introduction to Human Factors in Medical Devices</b></center><P>

<b>Draft: March 1, 1996</b><P>

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services<br>

Center for Devices and Radiological Health<P>

<center><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></center><P>

The purpose of this primer is to improve the safety of medical devices by
minimizing the likelihood of user error by <i>systematic, careful design of the
<b>user interface</b>, the hardware and software features that define the
interaction between users and equipment</i>. To this end, the document contains
background information about human factors as a discipline; descriptions and
illustrations of device problems; and a discussion of human factors methods.
Recommendations for manufacturers and health facilities are also included.<P>

Because many designers, engineers, scientists, and health professionals may be
unfamiliar with human factors, the primer is written as a basic educational tool
and assumes little background knowledge in the subject matter. At the same time,
much of the content may serve as a resource for those individuals who have had
experience with human factors issues.<P>

The primer is directed to the following audiences:<P>

<b>Manufacturers</b><P>

<UL>
<LI>Hardware and software engineers and designers<P>
<LI>Product and quality assurance managers<P>
<LI>Documentation writers<P>
<LI>Regulatory Affairs Staff<P>
<LI>Other research and development (R&amp;D), marketing, production, and
managerial staff who may influence user interface design</UL><P>

<b>Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</b><P>

<UL>
<LI>Device reviewers<P>
<LI>Incident evaluators<P>
<LI>Field investigators<P>
<LI>Compliance staff</UL><P>

<b>Health Professionals</b><P>

<UL>
<LI>Risk managers<P>
<LI>Physicians and nurses<P>
<LI>Maintenance personnel<P>
<LI>Purchasing agents</UL><P>

Good user interface design is critical to the safe and effective equipment
operation, installation, and maintenance. This document has been developed, in
part, to convince the reader that systematic attention to human factors is
extremely important. The practice of good human factors means <i>systematic
analysis and testing throughout development stages</i>; it is <i>not</i> simply a
matter of "fine tuning." Thorough attention to design will result in safer, more
usable devices and, correspondingly, fewer accidents, reduced training costs,
fewer liability problems, and less trial-and-error during device development.
Also, the information will be useful in planning human factors programs that
involve testing, incident analysis, or staff training. In addition to providing
technical information, the booklet discusses various human factors resources.<P>

Finally, "<i>Do It By Design</i>" encourages all readers to think critically
about the impact of device design upon the ability of health professionals to
treat patients safely and effectively. Consider the primer a starting point. One
should supplement this information with more detailed data, principles, and
methodologies from guidelines, standards, texts, and articles, some of which are
referenced in this document. Also, those individuals using these materials in
conducting human factors analyses and tests should obtain human factors
training.<P>

<center><h3>HUMAN FACTORS: AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</h3></center><P>

Human Factors is a discipline that achieves human-equipment compatibility by
means of user-interface design methods, user training development, and the
development of job aids. The emphasis of this document is design. The adjacent
figure illustrates some of the kinds of confusing design factors that underly the
need for human factors applications to hardware and software. Although the terms
"human engineering", "usability engineering", and "ergonomics" are often used
interchangeably as the process used to achieve highly usable equipment, "human
factors engineering", generally is used in this document.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/design/xraydesign1.gif" alt="This graphic shows that some user
interface designs are very confusing and likely to induce errors."></center><P>

Historically, human factors can be traced to early efforts by industrial a
engineers, psychologists, and efficiency experts to streamline manufacturing
operations and equipment for better worker efficiency. In World War II emphasis
shifted from production to personnel safety. A special focus was aircraft cockpit
design. Poor control and display design often induced pilot errors, sometimes
leading to crashes. Military applications have continued since, and in recent
years the advent of complex technology and media coverage of user problems and
accidents has increased the recognition of human factors. Examples include the
role of poor user interface design in the three-Mile Island meltdown; the
advertising of  "ergonomically-designed" automobiles; and the development of
"user friendly" computer hardware and software. Today this important discipline
is widely recognized by various governments , agencies, the military development
community, the telecommunications industry, numerous consumer product companies,
and increasingly by medical device manufacturers. <P>

<center><h3>WHY HUMAN FACTORS IS lMPORTANT TO MEDlCAL DEVICE
DESlGN</h3></center><P>

<i>Design-induced errors</i> by medical device users can, and do, lead to patient
injury, and sometimes death. Users respond directly to the equipment they are
operating, and misleading, illogical user interfaces  overtaxes even the most
skilled health practitioner. A brief discussion of device users, operating
conditions, incidents, and design implications will shed some light on the need
for systematic human factors engineering during medical device design and
development.<P>

<b>The Interaction of User Characteristics, Device Design, and the Operating
Environment</b><P>

Health professionals vary greatly in their physical, sensory, and mental
abilities. Lay people, who represent an increasing proportion of medical device
users, further extend such variability. Medical devices are used in many
environments, including operating rooms, emergency rooms, patient units, critical
care facilities, clinics, and homes. Conditions often are  adverse due to noise,
poor lighting, glare-producing surfaces, heat, dirt, electrical interference, and
moisture. Inadequate procedures, insufficient replacement parts, stress, and
fatigue can also degrade performance. Compounding the situation is the wide array
of equipment that a health practitioner operates. Devices used by a single
individual often differ greatly in design and frequency of use.<P>

A medical device will be used safely and effectively only if the
<i>interaction</i> of the operating environment, user capabilities, and device
design is considered by the manufacturer. The following dimensions of human
capability are basic to an understanding of human factors.<P>

<b>Physical and Sensory Characteristics</b><P>

People's most basic capacities include visual acuity, hearing, tactile dexterity,
strength, and reach. A number of related design factors influence human
performance: the legibility and discriminability of displayed symbols; audibility
and distinctiveness of alarms; strength required to make connections requirements
for reaching controls and activating keys; and other such factors.<P>

<b>Perceptual and Cognitive Abilities</b><P>
Perception fundamentally is how people identify and organize sensory input.
People's perceptual characteristics are important in the design and arrangement
of controls, keypads, displays, information presentation, as well as alarms and
alerts. Cognition refers to higher level mental phenomena such as memory,
attaching meaning to objects and concepts, use of rules and strategies, formation
of hypotheses, and abstract reasoning. There are numerous applications related to
design. For example, the multiple, hierarchical pathways and unlimited
information often found in computerized devices can rapidly exceed users' memory
limits. Therefore, a designer might develop easy-to-use retrieval systems, taking
advantage of well-established semantic, symbolic, and mnemonic techniques for
screen and menu design. Understanding people's limitations and exploiting their
strengths in this area is critical.<P>

<b>Expectancies:</b> People are predisposed to react to new situations according
to established habits. When users operate a new device that has physical and
informational characteristics resembling that of a device model they've
previously used, they often revert to earlier, often incorrect, habits.
Therefore, control and display design, coding, layout, and the operating steps in
a new model ideally will be similar to those on any predicate models having a
similar configuration.<P>

<b>Mental Models:</b> Based on experience, people form abstract concepts about
how complex phenomena actually work. Anesthesiologists, for example, form mental
representations of patient status based on information about respiration, heart
rate, oxygen levels, and other bodily processes. Monitors should present such
information in a manner consistent with such "models." There is a significant
need for thorough assessment of how users conceptualize device operations in
patient treatment and monitoring. This is a complex issue, because people differ
in how they mentally integrate and conceptualize data that changes over time.<P>

<b>Home-use</b><P>

Lay people increasingly use medical devices, and by virtue of illness, age, poor
reading ability, inadequate facilities, insufficient assistance, and inexperience
this population represents a special design challenge. Decrements in vision,
hearing, strength, dexterity, and memory are to be expected due to age and
illness. Also, older patients often are <i>unfamiliar with automated devices and
often are afraid to use them</i>. For this reason, as well as lack of medical
training, lay users' use of highly complex devices is a great concern. Also, some
devices that even physicians and nurses may find difficult to operate find their
way into the home, where the above problems are compounded by power outages,
insufficient electrical outlets, electromagnetic interference, and insufficient
spare parts and accessories. Additionally, basic structural design of household
doors and bathrooms don't always accommodate device use. Home-use devices should
be designed to accommodate that environment, since the reverse may not be
feasible.<P>

<b>Design Implications</b>

Obviously, completely "designing out" all problems associated with human
limitations and environmental factors is impossible. Few devices are entirely
"fail safe." However, designing the user interface with careful attention to the
user will result to a device that:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Accommodates a wide range of users working under variable conditions.<P>
<LI>Users can operate with fewer errors and resulting accidents. <P>
<LI>Require's less user training.</UL><P>

It is impossible to fully compensate for bad design, and numerous incident and
recall reports received by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)
attest to this. <i>The cumulative and interactive effects of errors can be
serious, and even disastrous</i>. The remainder of this booklet describes user
interface design issues, the process of human factors engineering, and related
topics.<P>

<center><h3>THE USER INTERFACE -- ISSUES AND PROBLEMS</h3></center><P>

This section describes and discusses problems related to human factors. The
material should foster an appreciation of the impacts of considering or not
considering user-interface during design and provide the reader with the
<i>rationale</i> that underlies human factors, as well as an understanding of
basic
principles. This discussion is illustrated primarily by brief summaries of
serious incidents that have been documented in CDRH's incident reporting systems.
The summary principles found in the "Rules of Thumb" in each subsection are by no
means exhaustive. The primer contains no detailed data on control dimensions and
forces, body dimensions, audition, vision, menu and screen design. The reader is
encouraged to consult guidelines such as the AAMI <i>Human factors engineering
guidelines and preferred practices for the design of medical devices (1993)</i>,
as well as other human factors guidelines and textbooks.<P>

<b>CONTROL/DISPLAY ARRANGEMENT AND DESIGN</b><P>

Although today's technology is moving away from display panel layouts having
numerous controls and displays, they are still important. Many  devices have
large consoles with rows of mechanical controls and displays. The designer must
consider the ability of users to quickly and  properly identify controls,
switches, and displays; reach and accurately set controls; read displays
accurately; and associate controls with their related displays. Efficient
configuration and grouping are important, as are unambiguous labels and keys that
are easy to operate. Finally, with all medical devices control and display
arrangements, operations, and labels should be consistent with user
expectations.<P>

<i>Examples of Errors Related to Hardware Design</i><P>

Below are a few examples of problems abstracted from incident reports and device
recalls.<P>

<OL>
<LI>A physician treating a patient with liquid oxygen set the flow control knob
between 1 and 2 liters per minute, not understanding that the scale numbers
represented discrete, not continuous, settings. <i>There was no airflow between
the
settings</i>. The patient, an infant, became hypoxic before the error was
discovered.
The device should have employed a discrete rotary control - one which has
detentes to snap the control into a discrete setting.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/design/xraydesign2.gif" alt="This graphic talks about discontinuous
flow between settings."></center><P>


<LI>In numerous incidents and recalls associated with defibrillators, the paddles
were difficult to remove from the retaining wells during emergencies. In one
incident, in which the patient died, the attendants couldn't operate the device
because they failed to activate a crucial control. The associated label was not
near the control.<P>

<LI>There have been cases in which patients were seriously injured when a nurse
over infused a patient after reading the number "7" as a "1". Given the depth of
the flowrate readout recessed in the infusion pump display panel, the top of the
"7" was blocked from view at even modest vertical viewing angles. Also, there
have been other reports in which flowrates have been similarly misread when
viewed from lateral angles, for example, 355 ml read as 55 ml.</OL><P>

These few examples illustrate the fact that seemingly small design flaws can
result in serious problems. Below are a few suggested rules of thumb for
designing the user interface.<P>

<i>Rules of Thumb</i><P>

<UL>
<LI>Make all facets of design as consistent with user expectations as possible.
Both users' prior experience with medical devices and well-established
conventions, such as symbology, are important.<P>

<LI>Design workstations, controls, and displays around the basic capabilities of
users regarding such characteristics as strength, dexterity, memory, reach,
visual acuity, and hearing.<P>

<LI>Design well organized and uncluttered control and display arrangements. These
facilitate proper identification and reduce the user's memory load.<P>

<LI>Be sure that auditory signals are well within users' threshold values for
amplitude and frequency. Consider the effects of ambient noise. Likewise, the
brightness of visual signals must be sufficient to be perceived by users working
under various conditions of ambient illumination. Also, both brightness contrast
and color contrast must be adequate to optimize legibility.<P>

<LI>Be careful that labels and displayed information are easy to read from
typical viewing angles and distances. Symbol, size, contrast, color, and display
depth must be considered.<P>

<LI>Ensure that the abbreviations, symbols, text, and acronyms placed on, or
displayed by, the device are also used in the instructional manual.<P>

<LI>Design control knobs and switches to correspond with both general conventions
and any that are unique to the user population.<P>

<LI>Arrange and design knobs, switches, and data-entry key in a way that reduces
the likelihood of accidental activation.<P>

<LI>Use color and shape coding to facilitate the rapid identification and
discrimination of controls and displays. Colors and codes should correspond to
universal industry convention. <P>

<LI>Space keys, valves, and control knobs sufficiently apart for easy
manipulation. This will also reduce the likelihood of  accidental
activation.</UL><P>

<i>Summary</i><P>

In summary, the layout and design of controls and displays greatly affects the
ability of users to successfully exercise functions and extract information
during device operations. The next section discusses the logic of such
user-device interactions as determined by software design.<P>

<b>DEVICE LOGIC AND MICROPROCESSING</b><P>

Although both hardware and software design influence device use, with modern
automation the logical, temporal, and informational characteristics provided via
software are increasingly crucial and often are error-inducing. For instance,
large amounts of data presented imprecisely and in an ambiguous,
difficult-to-read way increases the likelihood of it's being misread. An example
might be a crowded CRT display with cryptic identifiers combined with a time lag
between user response and displayed feedback. Such design characteristics overtax
the user's memory and decision-making capability.<P>

<i>Characterizing the Shift to Increasing Software</i><P>

With the large numbers of controls and displays found in conventional equipment,
the user must identify and integrate spatially disparate information. Although
such designs, and related problems of proper control identification and
activation are still common, the trend is to assign more functions to software.
This / reduces the number of controls and displays, but can increase the burden
on the user in other ways. The use of software is particularly obvious with
infusion pumps, like that shown in the illustration, below. Although there are
few controls and displays, the large amounts of programmed information impose
heavy demands on the user's memory, since most information must be called up in
sequence, which precludes simultaneous viewing of related data. Users "become
lost" in the system if sufficient prompts and roadmaps are absent. Also, users
easily misinterpret displayed data and/or respond inappropriately if precise
feedback and indications of functional status are missing.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/design/xraydesign3.gif" alt="This graphic shows an infusion
pump."></center><P>

Product developers often incorporate a large number of functions into the device
in order to provide flexibility and to serve a wider community, but extensive
functional capability may well impose an unreasonable cognitive load on the user
unless considerable effort is devoted to the design of the user interface. Below
are problems that lead to errors and apply to many medical devices. <P>

<UL>
<LI>Illogical or cumbersome control sequences<P>
<LI>Unfamiliar language, symbols, or codes.<P>
<LI>Inconsistencies among formats for successive or co-located displays<P>
<LI>Conventions that contradict user expectations<P>
<LI>Uncertain or no feedback after input<P>
<LI>Missing or ambiguous prompts<P>
<LI>Unsignalled resets or defaults<P>
<LI>No status information<P>
<LI>Ambiguous symbols or icons<P>
<LI>Missing lock-outs or interlocks<P>
<LI>Complex mental calculations required<P>
</UL>

<i>Examples of Errors Related to Software Design</i><P>

Many user errors induced by software design are incorrectly attributed to other
factors because frequently little, if any, physical evidence remains after an
incident. Also, software-related errors can be subtle. For example users become
frustrated by cumbersome data entry steps and make errors not directly related to
those steps. Ambiguous acronyms or abbreviations used in the command structure or
on menus may also lead to serious errors. On the other hand, there are many
tangible software  examples gathered from incident files, recalls, and analyses,
and a few are cited below.<P>

<OL>
<LI>There have been incidents with radiation treatment devices due to the fact
that users failed to enter dosage levels. The device software does not prompt the
user for the data. However, if the user does not enter a dosage level, the device
automatically defaults to a given value without signaling this value.<P>

<LI>As the result of software errors, a cardiac output monitor alarm could be
disabled when the control buttons were pushed in a specific sequence.<P>

<LI>Because of a software error, a neonatal monitor displayed half of the actual
BPM when heart rate exceeded a specific value. In one case, the user treated the
halved value as the real one, and the patient became hypoxic.<P>

<LI>With infusion pumps, there have been numerous recalls of devices in which
slight deviations from prescribed operating sequences have disabled device
operation, in some cases without any feedback to the operator. Other serious
incidents and recalls have involved such deficiencies as poorly signaled
operating modes, cumbersome operating steps, and the presentation of
unanticipated warning data on a display normally reserved for other critical
information.</OL><P>

Only by thorough analysis, testing, and the judicious use of guidelines and 
standards can efficient software designs be achieved.<P>

<i>Rules of Thumb</i><P>

<UL>
<LI>Don't contradict users' expectations. Rather, exploit their prior experience
with computerized equipment, and consider conventions related to language and
symbology.<P>
<LI>Be consistent and unambiguous in the use and design of headings,
abbreviations, symbols, formats, etc.<P>
<LI>Keep users informed about current device status.<P>
<LI>Provide immediate and clear feedback following user entries.<P>
<LI>Design procedural steps that progress in a logical, straightforward
sequence.<P>
<LI>Use appropriate prompts, menus, etc. to cue the user regarding important
steps; don't "strand" him!<P>
<LI>Give users recourse in the case of an error. Be helpful and forgiving by
providing conspicuous correction mechanisms.<P>
<LI>Don't overload or confuse users with information that is unformatted, densely
packed, or of too short duration.<P>
<LI>Consider the use of accepted symbols, icons, colors, and abbreviations, to
convey a great deal of information reliably, economically, and quickly. <P>
<LI>When struggling over a software design issue, don't overlook hardware
solutions -- for example, a stand-alone push-button for a high priority
time-driven function.<P>
<LI>Consider the use of dedicated displays or display sectors for highly critical
information. In such cases, <i>do not display other data in these
locations</i>.</UL><P>

<i>Summary</i><P>

Microprocessing offers terrific capabilities -- ready data access, manipulation,
and computation; speedy accomplishment of functions; and much more. Technological
sophistication, however, can work to the ; users' disadvantage if software design
,is done without regard for user needs. Designers should utilize human computer
interface (HCI) guidelines, thorough analysis, and use testing in software
development. Designers must also coordinate their efforts closely with the
hardware design work.<P>

<b>COMPONENT INSTALLATION</b><P>

Among the most common errors reported to CDRH are improper installation of device
components. Such errors are relatively conspicuous because of the physical
evidence remaining following an incident, as well as the frequently serious
consequences of such errors. Proper installation usually is critical to device
operation, and the effects of installation errors often go unrecognized for a
long time.<P>

<i>Problems and Examples</i><P>

Some commonly reported errors are as follows: tubing connected to the wrong port
or disconnected by casual contact; electrical leads inserted into an improper
power source; batteries or bulbs inserted incorrectly; and valves or other
hardware installed backward or upside-down. These examples are illustrated
below:<P>

<OL>
<LI>A component of an oxygen machine was installed upside down, resulting in a
patient death because of impeded air flow.<P>
<LI>A ventilator was recalled after low-pressure alarms had shorted out on
several occasions; the failures were traced to misinstalled batteries resulting
from the design of the battery ports.<P>
<LI>Three deaths were reported due to the introduction of feeding solutions into
IV tubing from enteral feeding tubes via an adaptor intended for introducing
medication into the enteral feeding system.<P>
<LI>Injuries and deaths have resulted from infusion-pump users confusing similar
cassettes, inserting one intended for a different model. Due to the confusion,
the medication volumes were incorrect, although the pump displays did not reflect
this.<P>
<LI>Breathing tube disconnects due to tube and connector design have lead to
numerous injuries, deaths, and "near misses" with ventilators.</UL><P>

Existing problems are exacerbated by the fact that there may be many component
manufacturers selling a wide range of parts for a type of device. There are a
great variety of cables, leads, connectors, valves, and tubing on the market, as
shown in the adjacent illustration. Parts for different models are often similar
in appearance and/or difficult to install, leading to mis-installations and
disconnections. In some cases, insufficient industry conventions, such as
standardized coding, may contribute to accidents. However, such accidents can be
prevented through careful human factors design. It is crucial that device 
components be considered part of a system, not as isolated elements!<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/design/xraydesign4.gif" alt="This graphic talks about improper
connections and mis-assembly."></center><P>

<i>Rules of Thumb</i><P>

These are general considerations for reducing the likelihood of confusion between
similar components and making improper connections.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Cables, tubing, connectors, leuers, connecting ports, and other hardware
should be designed for easy installation and connection; and "reversals",
substitutions, and other incorrect installations should be "designed out" if
possible.<P>
<LI>If the hazard cannot be eliminated via a design solution, color codes or
other markings will help to ensure proper connections and component
installation.<P>
<LI>Positive locking mechanisms are desirable whenever the integrity of
connections may be compromised by factors such as component durability.<P>
<LI>Protected contacts are necessary for body leads that can be inadvertently
introduced into electrical outlets, power cords, extension cords or other common
connectors. Exposed contacts should be avoided.</UL><P>

There is a tremendous variety of device attachments and accessories. Potential
hazards should be identified, and then appropriate design and coding techniques
used to prevent confusion and mis-installation.<P>

<b>ALARMS</b><P>

Alarms and related advisories are intended to alert device users about situations
and problems related to patient and device status. This seemingly straightforward
function often is complex. Alarms must attract the attention of someone working
intently on an often critical task unrelated to the alarming device. In some
environments, multiple alarms sounding simultaneously or intermittently on one or
more devices makes proper identification difficult. Staff become distracted, and
alarms may be considered a nuisance or, at best, part of the background. In
addition,  ambient noise and numerous visual displays can mask the output from 
auditory and visual displays. Interacting with all of the above problems are
malfunctions and false alarms due to electro-magnetic interference (EMI), static
electricity, or over-sensitivity.<P>

<i>Problems and Examples</i><P>

Errors related to alarm failures and design include the following: false alarms,
delayed alarm, too sensitive or insensitive alarms, alarms drowned out by noise,
ambiguous meanings, inappropriate silencing, and accidental disabling. Below are
two actual incidents.<P>

<OL>
<LI>A patient receiving oxygen died when a concentrator pressure hose loosened.
The alarm was not loud enough to  hear over the drone of the device.<P>

<LI>A patient on a ventilator died following accidental detachment of the
breathing tube from the humidifier. The alarm did not sound because the pressure
limit setting apparently was so low that it was effectively
non-functional.</OL><P>

Variations of these scenarios are common. Low alarm intensity, high ambient
noise, low battery conditions, alarm settings, and other factors combine to
create potentially dangerous situations.<P>

<i>Rules of Thumb</i><P>

<UL>
<LI>Consider a wide spectrum of environments in designing alarms.<P>
<LI>Be sure that visual and auditory alerts and critical alarms are included in
the device design requirements.<P>
<LI>Carefully consider the effects of over-sensitivity, electromagnetic
interference, or static electricity on alarm functioning.<P>
<LI>Design auditory alarms well within hearing thresholds for the typical user.
Likewise, the luminance of visual alarms should be above visual thresholds. Both
luminance contrast and color contrast must be sufficient for legibility under
variable lighting conditions.<P>
<LI>Use codes (e.g., color) that correspond to established conventions.<P>
<LI>Design alarms that are distinguishable from one another and, to the extent
possible, from alarms on other devices used in the same setting.<P>
<LI>Design alarms to activate immediately following the onset of a critical
problem, failure, etc. Alarms should identify the source of the problem.<P>
<LI>Consider prioritizing alarms, and remember that critical alarms ideally
provide redundant auditory and visual signals.<P>
<LI>Design alarms so that when they are disabled or silenced, they remain so only
temporarily; and visual indicators should indicate their status.</UL><P>

<b>OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES</b><P>

<i>Dimensions, Forces, and Angles</i><P>

Workstations, seating, and consoles associated with or integral to medical
devices literally must fit the user population. Data on the body dimensions of
various populations is collected and published in a variety of documents, such
dimensions including arm length, body height, leg length, and numerous other
bodily specifications. Such data are important in designing equipment so that
controls are within reach and seating arrangements are comfortable.
Conventionally applied to the design of work consoles, these considerations also
apply to many home use devices, such as wheelchairs. With the latter, such issues
as portability and compatibility with doors are applicable.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/design/xraydesign5.gif" alt="This graphic questions whether a
wheelchair fits a wide range of users and environments."></center><P>


More elusive, but critical, are the <i>biomechanical characteristics</i> of tools
such as hammers, scalpels, control knobs, and other devices that require
substantial dexterity or strength and/or involve repetitive motions. Errors or
musculo-skeletal injuries to health professionals and patients associated with
these factors are difficult to document, but they are important. Other devices to
consider are keyboards, some of which require unnatural hand positions and
increase the likelihood of carpel  tunnel syndrome, and dental drills difficult
to manipulate because of improperly (or not) angled shafts.<P>

<i>Inter-Device Compatibility</i><P>

"Transfer-of-training" from one device to another is a an important concern.
Health professionals often are trained on different makes and models of devices
performing the same functions. If two models have very similar user interface
configurations but differ with respect to required operator actions, habits
established with one device can interfere with user performance on the other.
"Negative transfer" from the original device will greatly increase the likelihood
of errors on the second. For example, if on/off switch positions are reversed on
two very similar devices, a user transferring from one to the other could easily
revert to the switch operation habits learned with the earlier device. The same
concern applies to a device that is retrofitted or redesigned, as in the case of
a recalled or new-generation model.<P>

<i>Failure Mode Effects Analysis</i><P>

Failure mode effects analysis usually considers the impacts of electrical,
mechanical, or software failures upon device functioning. But the impacts on the
user interface should be considered, as well. For example, false alarms lead
users to disregard further alarms; alarm failures, of course, have obvious
implications for device safety. Electrical or mechanical device failure can
affect the user interface in a way that confuses or misleads users. Sometimes a
device failure has produced improper or cryptic data display without the device
alerting the user that it is no longer functional. The impact of device failure
upon the users should be assessed prior to production and marketing.<P>

<i>Device Maintainability</i><P>

Medical devices should be designed for simple maintenance, since device
reliability sets an upper limit on safe, reliable operation. Maintenance
personnel often encounter the following problems:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Poor component labeling or coding.<P>
<LI>Inadequate self-diagnostic capability.<P>
<LI>Parts that are hard to locate visually or by touch.<P>
<LI>Screws and parts that are difficult to reach or manipulate.<P>
<LI>Confusing component arrangements.<P>
<LI>Requirements for difficult-to-find tools.<P>
<LI>Inadequate design for easy cleaning.</UL><P>

The signs of inadequate human factors attention include improperly connected
wires, stripped threads, high unreliability, dirty displays, and sticking keys,
among other things. Devices that are difficult to maintain not only are out of
use for long periods of time, but maintenance personnel may make errors or modify
devices to compensate for deficiencies.<P>

<i>Device Packaging</i><P>

Medical device packaging sometimes affects device operation. For example, there
have been incidents from packaging materials located so that users failed to
detect and remove them; in some cases device function was impaired. With one
infusion pump, serious accidents occurred from residual packaging materials
increasing flow rates. On the other hand, sometimes package design can be used to
reduce the likelihood of error. For example, catheters and compatible guide wires
usually are packaged together. The same is true of needles and syringes, some
infusion pumps and dedicated administration sets, and various contact lens
accessories. A unique example is a customized container cover having an integral
spacer that separates tissue heart valve leaves. The earlier use of cotton to
accomplish this had induced the formation of massive clots, leading to several
deaths.<P>

<i>Summary</i><P>

The effects of biomechanical stresses, negative transfer, failure modes,
maintainability, and packaging often are subtle and hard to identify. But they
must not be overlooked. The following section on human factors engineering deals
with methods that are used to design devices that are reasonably free from the
various design problems discussed up to this point.<P>

<center><h3>HUMAN FACTORS ENGINEERING*</h3></center><P>

* Although this section "talks to" the designer, the information should be of
interest to FDA personnel and health practitioners, as well. The discussion
further explains the rationale for human factors and may help clarify
expectations about device design and safety.<P>

Human factors engineering is a systematic, iterative process that is critical to
the effective user-interface design. Although product developers sometimes
believe that market studies provide most of the necessary human factors
information, such views are misleading. Some preference data obtained in market
research may prove useful, but human factors engineering involves the exercise of
various methods and tools throughout the design cycle. The developers of
commercial products, such as computers, have adopted and sometimes refined such
methods, referring to their efforts as <i>usability engineering</i>. Of
particular note
is their emphasis on user studies and computerized prototypes for testing and
analysis.<P>

Human factors engineering must be integral to both hardware and
software development to be effective. The members of the design team should
coordinate their efforts to gather analytical and user performance data to
achieve a user interface design that lends itself to safe device assembly,
operation, installation, and maintenance.<P>

<b>Overview and Rationale</b><P>

A new product development project, of course, can begin in any number of ways.
The initial concept may emerge from research, brain-storming, analysis, or
interviews and observations involving device users, designers, market
researchers, managers, or some combination of the above. As shown in the figure
on the next page, the tools and resources  for the effort may include incident
reports, technical articles, predicate devices, data from the medical community,
and expert opinion. Articles on device research and concepts, as well as
published product evaluations, provide a wealth of information about user
problems that are  associated with either specific models or with device types.
Finally, human factors guidelines should be used.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/design/xraydesign6.gif" alt="This graphic shows the Human Factors
Engineering Process."></center><P>


The critical requirement for human factors engineering is access to individuals
from the user population and their participation throughout the developmental
stages. Users contribute essential interview and observation data, and -they are
necessary for prototype testing. Also, along with subject-matter-experts, users
are valuable for analyses, scenario development, and brainstorming. Generally,
the sequence of analyses, studies, and tests rarely proceeds precisely in the
manner depicted in flow diagrams. No two projects are the same The following
factors, among others, will influence the flow of a given project<P>

<UL>
<LI>Pre-existing data<P>
<LI>Experience with predicate devices<P>
<LI>Complexity a the device<P>
<LI>A product's similarity to an existing one<P>
<LI>Criticality of the device<P>
<LI>Resources and organizational culture<P>
<LI>Design practices<P>
<LI>Competitive market pressures</UL>
<P>

Although there is latitude with respect to the analyses, tests, and tools
utilized, the process should not be haphazard. The design team should carefully
<i>plan</i> the human factors effort. Despite substantial variability among
different development projects, the <i>rationale</i> for human factors
engineering is the
same. Remember, the process is iterative, and participants from the user
population
play an essential a role throughout the effort. There is some trial-and-error,
but the larger problems are detected and eliminated during the earlier stages,
before the design is "hardened." The remainder of this section describes the
methods used by human factors professionals in designing equipment
user-interfaces.<P>

<b>DOCUMENT REVIEWS</b><P>

Documents on human factors and related device issues are valuable early in
development. Such information usually is easy to obtain and is useful in
understanding general and device-specific user interface issues, as well as human
factors methods.<P>

<i>The Literature</i><P>

Human factors articles, technical reports, and textbooks offer substantial
information. Numerous journals, magazines, and newsletters report studies and
surveys on the combined effects of design, environment, and work conditions upon
medical device operation. Also of value are design case studies and product
evaluations. Research, design, and conceptual articles of value also can be found
in human factors publications, such as <i>Human Factors, Ergonomics, and
Ergonomics
in Design</i>. Textbooks offer a more broad-based view of human factors
principles,
the design process, environmental factors, and the human being as an operator.
One will find both general discussions of sensory, physical, and cognitive
characteristics, as well as sensory-perceptual data. Finally, technical reports,
standards, and guidelines from government and military agencies can be useful.<P>

<i>Incident Reports and Recall Data</i><P>

A company's own recall data will provide historical data that may lead to
important insights about potential problems and design solutions relevant to new
product development . Review of reports to the FDA Medical Device Reporting (MDR)
system on your own devices or related to problems uncovered across a device area
may be enlightening. Although the reporting protocol traditionally has treated
use errors and design as separate issues, one can glean substantial information
from this source via careful analysis. In fact, such information may flag
numerous problems during the feasibility phase, before a development project is
underway.<P>

<i>Guidelines</i><P>

Guidelines provide principles, data, and human factors engineering methods. An
example of a principle might be something such as "There should be feedback
displayed immediately following a user input via a control, key, switch, or other
input device." Data may be of various types: anthropometric, angles, dimensions,
visual or auditory limits, etc. Methodology and tools are discussed in this
section.<P>

The most widely recognized guideline in the medical device community is the AAMI
document, <i>Human factors engineering guidelines and preferred practices for the
design of medical devices</i>, published in 1993. There are other guidelines
published by government agencies, notably in military standards and guidelines.
In addition, some textbooks are written as guidelines.<P>

Guidelines should be used judiciously. They are <i>not intended as
"cookbooks,"</i> and
one should remember that the effectiveness of a guideline is in part determined
by the education and skill of the person using it. Understanding the
<i>rationale</i> 
behind any principle or methodology is critical.<P>

<i>Manuals</i><P>

Review of <i>User instruction manuals for existing devices</i> can yield
information
about pitfalls to avoid and possible features to include when considering the
development of a new product. For example, a warning like "be careful of
automatic flowrate defaults " indicates that such defaults may not be clearly
signaled or, possibly, may not be really desirable in the first place. Or, the
review and comparison of the written operating procedures and control panel
illustrations may point to a number of strengths or weaknesses in key layout,
operating logic, and other user interface concerns during new product
development.<P>

Once the user interface concept begins to take shape, work on <i>user instruction
manuals for the new device</i> should begin. If this is coordinated closely with
the
design effort, the very process of developing the new manual may uncover design
problems.<P>

<i>Summary</i><P>

Reviewing the types of documents discussed above will help provide a clearer
picture of the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Sensory, perceptual, physical and cognitive characteristics of people.<P>
<LI>Environmental interactions with human performance, especially as mediated by
user
interface design.<P>
<LI>Human factors principles and methods.<P>
<LI>Generic problems associated with medical device types.<P>
<LI>Strengths and weakness of both predicate devices and the concept for the
device
under development.</UL><P>

Document reviews help to ask the right questions, avoid pitfalls, and get product
design process off on the right track.<P>

<b>EXPLORATORY STUDIES</b><P>

Obtaining first-hand information from doctors, nurses, and lay-users is essential
in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of device designs. Other potential
participants to consider are risk managers, maintenance personnel, trainers, and
supervisors. Questionnaires, on-duty observations, interviews, and focus tests
are methods used to assess design concepts, mockups, or predicate devices.<P>

<i>Why Do Such Studies?</i><P>

Direct contact with the user population is absolutely essential for good human
factors work, and it should be initiated in the earliest conceptual stages of
product design. Observations and remarks about existing devices, desirable design
features, and working conditions will provide the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>A snapshot of how health professionals use their devices, how operating
conditions (including the multi-device environment), affect use, and what
problems are encountered.<P>
<LI>A sampling of the user population with respect to individual differences.<P>
<LI>Design and engineering staff familiarization with the device use
environment.<P>
<LI>Ideas for new designs and reactions to design concepts.<P>
<LI>Information necessary for establishing performance test protocols and
performance criteria.</UL><P>

Early studies, along with document reviews and task analyses, will get the design
process off in the right direction. They engender creative thinking and reduce
the likelihood of major mistakes in the design process.<P>

<i>Study Methods</i><P>

Planning ahead is a "must". Carefully consider the logistics and costs associated
with access to facilities and personnel, project staff, and equipment. In
addition, pilot work involving observational and interviewing procedures is
highly desirable.<P>

Below is a brief discussion of some techniques frequently used in early studies.
They are not independent of one another, and techniques discussed elsewhere such
as task analysis, may also be integrated into these approaches.<P>

<b>Observation:</b> In a medical facility the operating rooms, emergency rooms,
and critical-care units are fertile areas for observational studies. These
include the observation of <i>ongoing operations</i> and the inspection of
devices
<i>following operation</i>, especially after prolonged use. There are
implications for
such areas as design for maintenance, cleaning, installation, and the effects of
environmental conditions upon the user interface. In the operating environment,
substances such as dirt, water, saline solutions, alcohol, blood, and coffee
often impede proper device use.<P>

Wherever studies are conducted, observations should be non-intrusive and as
systematic as possible. Observations can be recorded as narrative description
and/or as entries on data sheets formatted with predetermined data categories.
Demographic and device information also should be recorded. When videotaping a
session, the tapes should be indexed by critical events and times to avoid
extremely time-consuming review at a later time. Another issue is the sampling of
subjects and operating conditions. Within the scope of time and resources
available, observing different users under varying work conditions is desirable
to ensure generality of the observations made.<P>

<b>Interviews:</b> Interviewing is a very flexible way of obtaining such
information as
opinions about specific devices and problems, user preferences, and ideas about
improving user-interface design. Interviews also can be conducted quickly and in
conjunction with observations. Below are a few ideas about interviewing personnel
in medical facilities.<P>

<b><i>Interviewing Users:</i></b> Health practitioners often hold perceptions
about a device
that differ greatly from the designer's. Interviewers can obtain valuable data by
having doctors or nurses do the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Describe "critical incidents" involving a device.<P>
<LI>Walk through the operational steps.<P>
<LI>Compare relative strengths and weaknesses of different models.<P>
<LI>Recommend device changes.<P>
<LI>Assess a new device concept.</UL><P>

Whatever is done, remember that interviewees usually won't be able to visualize
design concepts in the abstract. They should react to existing devices (ideally
presented during the interview), mockups, or drawings of a device interface. In
the latter instance, the proposed operational logic should be clear. Allowing
people to react to tangible concepts and actual devices will provide a wealth of
ideas. Questions such as those in the adjacent blood glucose monitor
illustration, can help to target design problems.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/design/xraydesign7.gif" alt="This graphic discusses user reactions to
a blood glucose monitor."></center><P>


<b><i>Interviewing Supervisors, Trainers, and Risk Managers:</i></b> Most
supervisors have
fairly broad views of device strengths and weaknesses. They are aware of serious
incidents and device characteristics that have been substantial impediments to
productivity. The training staff will have a more detailed picture of the effects
of poor design on training time, as well as recommendations about the
instructional manuals. Risk managers document problems, including incidents, that
can shed light on specific design problems.<P>

<b><i>Maintenance Personnel and Technicians:</i></b> These parties may have a
unique
perspective on device problems. For example, poor design for installation and
possibly examples of misinstalled components may come to light. Also, users often
bring them "broken" devices that, in fact, are functional; they simply are
difficult to operate! Finally, since recalled devices often are modified on site
by company service representatives, they may know of both hardware and software
fixes related to the user interface.<P>

<b>Conducting Focus Groups:</b> Focus group sessions are group interviews with a
few
individuals (e.g., 8 -10) from a specified population conducted to obtain
opinions and ideas with regard to a product concept. A focus group would consist
of a few health practitioners, ideally people from different facilities. These
individuals would be prospective users of the new device under consideration.
Such sessions should be conducted by experienced moderators working from scripts
prepared in concert with the design team. Well-conducted sessions yield numerous
ideas about both user-interface design alternatives and user requirements.
However, since device users generally have limited knowledge of design
alternatives and principles, <i>subjective data must be weighed against known
interface characteristics, human factors expertise, and user performance
data.</i><P>

<b>Physical Measurements:</b> Measuring sound and light will help in the
assessment of
such design-moderated environmental factors as glare, contrast, and the masking
of auditory alarms by ambient noise. Samples from different facilities will
produce data useful for profiling typical work environments, and such profiles
may be useful during actual design.<P>

<i>Summary</i><P>

Modest studies such as those discussed in this section will pay handsome
dividends. The design team gains a better appreciation of the user population,
their working environment, problems with predicate devices, and viable
alternatives for new designs.<P>

<b>ANALYSIS</b><P>

Various analyses are important to good user interface design, and these  include
analyses of functions, tasks, and hazards. Such analyses will help shape the user
interface by providing information about the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>User needs and characteristics.<P>
<LI>Potential performance bottlenecks and error-inducing factors.<P>
<LI>Device impacts upon user training.<P>
<LI>Device operating logic. <P>
<LI>Potential hazards.</UL><P>

Analyses are woven throughout the development process and merit careful
attention.<P>

<i>Functions and Tasks Defined</i><P>

Considering the device and user together as a system, their actions can be
considered <i>functions</i>. Primary functions are device installation,
maintenance, operation, and monitoring. In the human factors profession, the
user's functional contributions are referred to as tasks. For example, a number
of infusion pump functions are necessary for accomplishing its intended use, and
to some extent these functions are shared by the device and the user. As an
illustration, one user task is the entry of flowrate data, the device function
being the pump action in response to the user's input. Or, regarding monitoring,
the pump monitors pressure and rate and displays the estimated flowrate values,
which in turn the user monitors. In addition, if pressure exceeds or falls short
of specified limits, the device will alarm. Likewise, the user will "alarm" if he
notices out-of limit values.<P>

<i>Addressing Functional Issues</i><P>

Increasingly, devices are multi-functional in order to accommodate a wider range
of users and to increase the flexibility of device application. Such capability
can impede ease of device use unless the respective assignments of functions to
the device and the user are carefully weighed. Machines are good at functions
such as storage and retrieval of coded data, rapid computation, and timing, among
others. People outperform machines in sensory, judgmental, interpretative, and
creative tasks. Functional sophistication and the allocation of functions between
a device and its user have very important implications for the eventual user
interface, and the following hypothetical example is a case in point.<P>

Scenario<P>

<blockquote>An infusion pump designer decides to provide the user with the
capability to "stack" flow rates, i.e., programming a sequence of rates that will
apply to successive patient administrations. The rate-retrieval function is now
added to the conventional rate-input function. A number of questions arise:
Should retrieval and administration of rates be automatic or manual? What happens
if one of the queued flowrates is accidentally deleted, defaulting to the next
flowrate "in line"? How does the user identify and track the flowrates? How does
the user access and change given flowrates? How are other device functions
coordinated with the different rates?</blockquote><P>

These are questions to be addressed very early. The answers will help shape the
functional design, which, in turn will determine the user-interface
alternatives.<P>

Many functions-related issues are linked to the complicated interrelationships of
user characteristics, individual variability, operating conditions, and
criticality of various functions. For example, in a ventilator, illustrated
below, the degree to which alarm settings should be automated or under user
control depends upon the latitude required by the user. Such factors as user
expertise, other equipment alarms, and criticality of alarmed conditions must be
considered with respect to allowable user discretion in setting alarm limits and
silencing, disabling, and resetting alarms. Some functional questions are even
more difficult. In some cases excessive functions may overburden users no matter
what the interface solution is. The other extreme is the case in which automation
can simplify operation to the point that the operator becomes bored or "loses the
picture," and the flexibility to respond to an emergency is lost. Most functional
issues are not this difficult, but the appropriate tradeoffs must be considered
before the design concept evolves much further.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/design/xraydesign8.gif" alt="This graphic shows that alarms on
monitors and ventilators pose difficult questions about allocating
functions."></center><P>


<i>Analyzing Tasks</i><P>

At various points during development the design team should perform detailed
sequential analyses of those tasks that comprise such functions as assembly,
installation, operation, and maintenance. Task analysis is (critical to good
human factors engineering and is performed throughout the design process. In the
early conceptual stages critical tasks can be identified and described by
observing and/or questioning health professionals who use the type of device
being considered for development. When design concepts are initially formulated,
the analyses will be conducted as paper-and-pencil exercises. As development
progresses, analyses will be performed with the help of such tools as device
descriptions, drawings, predicate devices and prototypes.<P>

Regarding procedures, there are many methodological "variations on a theme", but
task analysis is straightforward. Depending upon scope and purpose, the analyst
will do some, or all, of the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>List the major tasks, such as calibration, entering operating parameters, or
attaching the device to patient.<P>
<LI>For each task, describe the necessary information, user actions, required 
decisions, and related components.<P>
<LI>For each action, or step, describe the equipment response.<P>
<LI>Record observations and inferences about design factors potentially impacting
the user.<P>
<LI>List the effects of environmental conditions on the user interface and
performance, and the impact of the user interface on training
requirements.</UL><P>

A subject matter expert and individuals from the device user population should
participate in the initial analyses, when the design concept is starting to take
shape. A task analysis format is an organizing structure that permits the analyst
to record data in a form that facilitates coherent integration of behavioral and
device information.<P>

On the next page is a table with a few sample steps from an analysis of a
marketed infusion pump as part of a pilot research study at CDRH. The analysts
were "troubleshooting" the user interface design. Following the table is a brief
description of the analysis and related field work in a scenario form.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/design/xraychart.gif" alt="This chart is entitled Sample of a Few Task
Analysis Steps from Analysis of Actual Pump: Troubleshooting the User
Interface."></center><P>

<font size =-1><b>Note</b>: Double function PAUSE/STOP key works operates differently in different
modes, and it also "remembers" first activation across modes. User easily can
turn off device by accident.</font><P>

Discussion of Analysis<P>

<blockquote>The infusion pump seemed very "easy to use." The human factors team
traversed the initial setup steps with seemingly little difficulty. But shortly
into the exercise, problems arose. First we had been operating on the assumption
that the pump was plugged in when, in fact, it wasn't. The battery and AC power
icons were poorly located, small, and had little iconic value. The icons were so
small that they appeared as little "dots" at normal viewing distances and angles.
We also discovered that users could miss important status information and prompts
due to very brief displays of the data. Another problem was a flowrate default
mechanism that could mislead users. In addition, with fast-scrolling flowrate
values, the desired value could easily be exceeded (or lower than intended, upon
recycling); poorly correlated visual and auditory feedback contribute to this
potentially dangerous situation. Finally, inconsistencies in a double function
key operation can exacerbate other problems by confusing and frustrating the
user. The research team visited a hospital after performing this analysis, and,
by chance, this pump was used in the unit visited. The head nurse stated that she
had selected it because it seemed "user friendly." Unfortunately, the unit staff
found it so difficult to use that she now considers the pump not only an
inconvenience, and an impediment to safety and effectiveness.</blockquote><P>

During the development of the pump in this example, had task analyses been
performed, <i>a set of guiding principles for pump setup, such as the following,
might have emerged</i>. They night have looked something like the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Status indication and feedback should be precise and unambiguous.<P>
<LI>Displayed alerts should be attention-getting and in view until acted upon.<P>
<LI>Flow rate and volume entry mechanisms should be convenient for the user, but
without sacrificing accuracy (e.g., over-scrolling).<P>
<LI>Specific keys should operate in a consistent manner across modes.</UL><P>

The next section recommends that human factors be integrated into product
development procedures conventionally used to isolate potentially hazardous
device failures.<P>

<i>Hazard Analyses</i><P>

<i>Hazard analysis</i> usually is performed to assess the hazards associated with
electrical or mechanical failures. Considering users as components in fault tree
and failure mode criticality analyses is also important. In <i>Fault Tree
Analysis
(FTA)</i> one can consider catastrophic incidents as "fault"s, analytically
isolating
the failures, or potential errors causing them. Conversely, using <i>Failure Mode
Effects Analysis (FMCA)</i>, one could start with "failures", or user errors,
"faults". The utility of these approaches can be illustrated by reference to
infant insertion of patient leads into AC power cords by parents, siblings, and
health professionals. This is depicted in the accompanying illustration. By first
anticipating such hazards, an analyst could have deduced causal errors. Or, the
same end could be accomplished by first hypothesizing possible errors. Either
case represents a 'What-if" scenario for all intents and purposes. It is
important to note that <i>hazard analyses may pinpoint low-frequency errors not
discovered in prototype tests involving users.</i><P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/design/xraydesign9.gif" alt="This graphic discusses using hazard
analyses to identify hazards and solutions for them."></center><P>

<i>Other Analyses</i><P>

Finally, other human factors techniques are <i>time lines and workload
analysis</i>.
Time lines represent sequential and simultaneous responses required of the user
and graphed over time. Workload analysis can produce measures ranging from
estimated energy expenditures for physical tasks to subjective and performance
measures associated with task loading. Task loading refers to additional
performance requirements imposed on operators. Both of these methodologies are
especially useful in multi-task situations which often involve the use of more
than one device by the user or users.<P>

<i>Summary</i><P>

Thorough analysis is a powerful tool and is necessary throughout the design
process. Overall, the findings help shape alternative user interface designs,
elucidate design flaws, and provide focus for human factors tests.<P>

<b>USABILITY TESTING</b><P>

Although the literature, small studies, and analyses will continue to be valuable
following the early product development stages, performance testing becomes
increasingly important as the design concept is refined. The "proof of the
pudding" is the ability of users to operate, install, and maintain devices safely
and effectively, and this can be assured only via testing.<P>

<i>Rationale</i><P>

Testing must be understood in the context of iterative design, which includes
inputs such as observations, opinions, human factors principles, and research.
The expertise of designers, health professionals, human factors professionals,
and researchers all feed into the actual design. Design concepts must be
subjected to <i>dynamic</i> tests as they become increasingly refined. There is
no
better way than having users perform simulated tasks using prototypes that embody
the user-interface design concepts<P>

<i>Prototyping</i><P>

From the human factors perspective, prototypes are representations of the user
interface, as defined by both the hardware and software. As development
progresses, the prototypes increase in <i>fidelity</i>, the degree of resemblance
to a
working device. Examples include story boards, screen prints, interactive
computer models, mockups, simulators, and working models. In prototype testing,
there are two interrelated fidelity issues the physical components with which
users interact and the more abstract, <i>conceptual device characteristics</i>
that help
define such interactions. Their relative importance depends on the purpose of a
given test. If installation and control or display layout and size are of special
interest, for example, a mockup probably would be used for simulated tasks. But
if underlying machine logic and information presentation are of concern,
prototypes ranging from a progressive series of story boards or interactive
screen displays to a working model should be employed to evaluate user efficiency
in task accomplishment. To some extent the impact of machine logic on performance
is a function of the prototype capability to respond to data entry with
appropriate information display. But even low fidelity prototypes can be valuable
as long as the critical procedural and informational characteristics are conveyed
to the user.<P>

<b>Non-Interactive Prototypes</b>: Modest testing sometimes begins early in
development
and may be combined with the exploratory tests and analyses described earlier. An
early test might consist of a user, or users, completing simulated tasks by
performing data entry operations on a sequence of story boards by indicating the
correct key or control, verbally describing the actions. Each user input is
followed by the presentation of a new board showing the feedback, prompts, or
status change appropriate to that input. Both performance accuracy and comments
will point to potential bottlenecks, errors, and design improvements.<P>

<b>Interactive Prototypes</b>: These increasingly are used throughout
development, and
they engender more realism in task performance than do story boards, screen
prints, and other static representations. Key panels and controls can be
represented graphically on a computer, with limited functionality programmed in.
Thus, for example, a finger press on a specific "button", simulated on a touch
screen, could result in apparent button movement followed by displayed feedback.
The program then sets up the contingencies for the next operator response."
Horizontal" prototypes allow activation of a wide range of data inputs without
much operational depth; that is, hierarchical menu depth is minimal. 'Vertical"
approaches allow more in-depth operation of fewer functions; for example, one or
two menu hierarchies might be fully accessible. Also, a limited number of task
paths can be programmed, depending upon test focus. Of course, the most incisive
data will be obtained with working and production models.<P>

<i>Planning, Designing, and Conducting a Test</i><P>

Testing requires much deliberation and planning. Below is a discussion outlining
the test process.<P>

<b>Purpose of the Test:</b> Factors such as developmental stage, previous or
anticipated
problems, and design alternatives will determine the purpose and focus of a test.
Some tests are conducted largely to uncover user interface problems, while in
other cases the purpose may be to assess a new design concept versus another
manufacturer's product to provide benchmarks of user performance. Or, overall
efficiency, performance times, influence of environmental factors, or interactive
effects of other equipment may be of interest.<P>

<b>Requirements and Measures:</b> User requirements are based primarily on the
earlier
interviews, observations, and literature reviews. Some requirements are specific,
such as "Installation should take no more than 30 minutes." In other instances,
they may be broader, such as "Novice users should reach high levels of efficiency
after a few hours of training." A precise definition of efficiency in terms of
errors and time can be hard to determine precisely while the design concept is in
a state of flux, but at some point in development a clearer picture of expected
performance levels will emerge, and detailed performance criteria need to be
defined. If possible, they should be quantitative, and they should be linked to
safe use and any other goals important to the manufacturer and user
population.<P>

Various measures are used in testing. Errors may be recorded by direct
observation, videotaping, or electronic data logging. Speed of operation is based
on task completion times, and other objective measures may be utilized, such as
number of times the user must refer to the device manual. Verbal responses also
are important and can be obtained via interviews or by having users state the
rationale for their actions as they progress through task sequences. Also
important are subjective impressions of usability and potential safety
problems.<P>

<b>Facilities:</b> Depending upon resources and nature of the test, a very modest
usability laboratory may suffice. A "bare-bones" lab might consist of a room
containing a table, chairs, electrical outlets, and adequate lighting. An
increasingly elaborate setup would include a one-way mirror, observation room,
video camera(s), rheostatic lighting, tape player (for noise presentation), an
automated data-logging system, a microphone, and other medical equipment.
Finally, as discussed later, testing in medical facilities is another
possibility.<P>

<b>Test Subjects:</b> As with other human factors studies, subjects should be
representative of the user population. If the device is used by a fairly
homogenous population, data obtained with about 10 individuals from that
population <i>may</i> be sufficient to eliminate most usability problems. The
design
team must consider the extent to which additional problems are uncovered as more
subjects are added and/or as more tests are run. Also, with a more heterogenous
population, larger samples are desirable. A larger sample also is necessary if
comparisons between different device models are of concern. Finally, the test
team may want to maximally stress the user interface by utilizing subjects having
relatively little experience with the type of device being tested.<P>

The number of subjects also will depend on the stage of product development.
Iterative tests using story boards or early prototypes can be  accomplished with
few subjects, especially if the test focus is the assessment of a few design
changes. However, in thorough tests of high fidelity prototypes, such as working
and production models, a larger subject sample definitely is necessary.<P>

<b>Conducting the Test:</b> Written <i>scenarios</i> will provide the organizing
structure for
what the subjects actual  will be doing. A scenario generally is a written
description of what the subject is expected to accomplish, and the description
may be broad or narrowly-focused. In the former, the subject might be asked to
turn on an infusion pump, for example, and set it up for drug administration. The
subject would progress through all the necessary tasks. But given a narrower test
focus, subjects might be asked to complete only tasks of special concern, an
example being the following: "Key in the appropriate flowrate and
volume-to-be-infused parameters." Whether subjects are given broad, narrow,
short, or long scenarios, these should be clearly written down to help ensure
consistency across subjects and test conditions. Health professionals will be of
use in checking the scenarios for realism and accuracy, as well as helping to
create them.<P>

On the next page is an example of a scenario that might be used in the assessment
of an arrhythmia monitor user-interface design. It consists of an illustration of
a monitor followed by a narrative that requests the subjects to perform various
tasks. This will help the test team obtain data on errors, performance times, and
subjects' impressions of device design features. Analysis and evaluation of this
data will answer the kinds of questions listed under the monitor figure.<P>

Example Scenario<P>

<blockquote>First ready the monitor for use by checking the receiver and recorder
connections. After switching the power on, switch on the monitor and perform the
basic setup tasks, such as checking and adjusting the calibration, amplitude,
gain, and alarm limits. When prompted, retrieve waveforms and trend data as
specified. Report any visual alarms, such as disconnected lead wires or a low
battery.</blockquote><P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/design/xraydesign10.gif" alt="This graphic shows a monitor
interface."></center><P>


Generally the device users selected as the test subjects should be health
professionals who are not trained on the specific model. After a subject receives
brief familiarization with the monitor, there are different ways the test team
can proceed. It could permit the subject to run through the operations at his own
pace or, at any point, interrupt with questions about bottlenecks or apparent
problems. If certain issues are of special interest, the test might focus on
these, spending less time on others.<P>

When conducting tests, it often makes sense to really <i>stress the user
interface.</i>
This can be accomplished by giving the user minimum device familiarization and
limiting use of the instruction manual. Also, testing novice device users imposes
a greater burden on the interface.<P>

Possible performance measures in the example scenario could include set-up times;
number of errors; type of errors, failures to detect and discriminate alarms; and
any observations that indicate performance obstacles. In addition, if the subject
is asked to "think aloud" as he proceeds through the tasks, it is important to
develop a record of his remarks. Finally, pre- and post- test questionnaires or
interview comments, likes and dislikes about user interface elements,
preferences, as and other comments about overall device safety and usability
issues are valuable. One caveat, however, is that users generally are
inexperienced with design principles. Although user opinions generally are
valuable, their <i>preferences for various interface designs must be weighed
against
performance data and expert opinion</i>.<P>

<i>Testing in the "Real" Environment</i><P>

The user interface should be tested under conditions that are as realistic as
possible. The following section discusses levels of reality in human factors
testing.<P>

<b>Simulating Actual Conditions in the Lab</b>: Some aspects of actual use
conditions are reasonably easy to simulate. For example, adjustable lighting and
individual lamps of varying wattage and directionality will produce variable
levels of illumination and glare. Likewise, tape recordings from emergency rooms,
operating rooms, and critical care facilities will reproduce decibel and
frequency levels that challenge alarm audibility and the user's concentration.<P>

More difficult to simulate are patient and device status and the interactive
effects of multiple devices; but fairly good simulations are possible. In the
monitor example above, changes in patient and device status could be simulated by
programming in ECG changes and alarms. In multiple device scenarios, test
subjects can alternate between different devices they typically use on the job.
Variables might include conflicting user interface designs and problems
associated with device attachments.<P>

<b>Simulations in Health Facilities</b>: Even without patients involved,
performance testing in health facilities can add substantial realism. If on duty
doctors and nurses are tested on devices that effectively simulate device
interfaces and functions, the effects of stress and fatigue on device use can be
assessed. But obviously, testing in emergency rooms, operating rooms, or critical
care facilities is difficult, if not impossible. Because tests are obtrusive,
testing in many cases probably should be performed during breaks and be limited
to especially problematic design issues. The exception would be a full simulation
in which physicians, nurses, or medical team performs a lengthy, simulated,
procedure. The facility, such as an operating room, essentially becomes a
laboratory.<P>

<b>Clinical Trials</b>: Ideally, one could do full testing during clinical
trials. However, there are very definite limits. First, manipulating and
measuring health practitioners' behavior can endanger patients. Second, the user
interface design should be at least adequate <i>prior</i> to clinical trials. But
these
factors don't preclude some testing at this stage. Doctors and nurses can be
alerted to design issues of special interest and interviewed after the completion
of procedures. Finally, observations by a team consisting of designers and
clinically-trained individuals can be fruitful.<P>

<i>Summary</i><P>

Obtaining performance and subjective data from actual users is crucial. If test
subjects cannot safely and effectively use a device under test conditions, you
can be sure performance under actual conditions will not meet these criteria.
Thorough testing helps ensure that the final product meets the needs of health
professionals and patients.<P>

<center><h3>SPECIAL ISSUES FOR MANUFACTURERS AND HEALTH FACILITIES</h3></center>

<b>INITIATING A COMPANY HUMAN FACTORS PROGRAM</b><P>

<i>Personnel</i><P>

Just as no two product development projects are identical, the same can be said
of corporations. Size, organization, and culture vary from firm to firm, and all
of these will affect the implementation of a human factors program. Whether
relying primarily on consultants or on in-house staff having experience with
human factors engineering, integrating human factors personnel into project
design teams is crucial.<P>

Also, it behooves manufacturers to educate both technical and managerial staff
about human factors, and the target audience should include engineers, designers,
manual and training developers, risk managers, quality managers, and corporate
executives. At the most basic level, staff need to know what a human factors
program is and why it is important. One should consider having a human factors
consultant give a few seminars and maybe doing a demonstration test. Involving a
company's own designers and products will greatly increases the effectiveness of
such a demonstration. Case studies also are useful, and these can be developed
around hypothetical problems or successful applications of human factors.
Likewise, consultants' first-hand experience with development efforts design
principles, liability issues, the human factors literature and research, and
other subjects will make any such presentations tangible and interesting.
Finally, there are established professional short courses in human factors, and
many universities offer degree programs in this discipline. There is a caveat,
however. Casual "armchair" approaches do not work! Training and experience are
necessary.<P>

<i>How Much Human Factors Attention is Necessary?</i><P>

Although there is no formula for deciding how extensive a human factors effort
must be, consideration of some basic variables will facilitate decision making.
Consider the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>The nature of the user-device interaction, the user population, and the use
environment.<P>
<LI>The likelihood and criticality of errors. <P>
<LI>The extent to which user interface alternatives are feasible. <P>
<LI>The likelihood that a well-designed user interface will reduce the chance of
errors and consequent injury.</UL>
<P>
For example, in the unlikely case where a device has virtually no user interface
or functional integrity precludes interface design options, a substantial human
engineering effort would not be warranted. However, most devices require
substantially user/device interaction, and the complexity of the interface
usually must be considered. Also, the greater the impact of errors upon the
health and safety of patients, the greater the need for thorough analysis and
testing.<P>

<i>Resources</i><P>

Some resources already have been discussed: the literature, guidelines, and
current staff expertise. Many firms may also need outside help in establishing a
human factors program. There are many highly qualified human factors consultants
and consulting firms available for such purposes. Human factors specialist apply
their expertise to areas ranging from military systems, air-traffic control, and
nuclear power plants to office equipment and, increasingly, medical devices; the
basic rationale and methodology is the same in all of these areas. The societies
listed below serve as clearing houses for human factors consultants. The

<i>Quality Assurance</i><P>

Human factors requirements should be integral to your test and development plan.
As you progress through development, you should check off the major human factors
issues related to the effort. Appendix 1 shows an example of a number of key
questions to ask during the development program. It delineates broad questions,
first about the need  to do human factors human factors engineering, and then
about process and principles.<P>

<b>ADVICE TO HEALTH FACILITIES</b><P>

Recognizing human factors design problems with already purchased devices is
important. The selection of new equipment that staff can operate safely and
efficiently also is important. This section deals with these issues.<P>

<i>Recognizing Problems</i><P>

Health professionals are more likely to blame themselves for errors than they are
to blame the equipment. User interface flaws can be subtle, and doctors' and
nurses' attention is focused on the patient, not the device. Also, a sense of
professional responsibility often precludes "blaming" the device. But <i>while
user
interface problems don't negate one's responsibility for device training and
careful device operation, poor design can greatly increase the likelihood of
errors</i>, and such errors can have serious consequences.<P>

If there are serious design flaws with your equipment, patterns may emerge if you
look hard enough. Ask users about operational problems they've had with a given
device, and try to determine how widespread the problem is. Also, biomedical
engineers and other maintenance personnel constitute a valuable source of
information. In addition to individual interviews, you also could try a focus
group or questionnaire approach, discussed earlier under Exploratory Studies.<P>

<i>Evaluating Already-Purchased Devices</i><P>

Below are some indications of problems:<P>

<b>Observations:</b> Training has been slow and arduous. Only a few staff seem
able to
use the device. Staff tend to modify the equipment or take shortcuts.<P>

<b>Installation Problem:</b> Staff find installation of accessories difficult,
confusing, or overly time-consuming. Alarms and batteries often fail. Incorrect
accessories sometimes are installed. Parts often become detached.<P>

<b>Complaints:</b> Displays are difficult to read or understand. Controls are
poorly
located or labeled. Alarms are difficult to hear or distinguish. Device alarms
are very annoying. Device operation is illogical and confusing.<P>

<b>Incidents:</b> Accidents or "near misses" can be a real tip-off, especially if
there
are highly competent individuals involved. In questioning staff and examining
implicated devices, look for the kinds of problems mentioned above.<P>

Regarding incidents, above, the new coding manual for MedWatch Form 3500A
contains a number of codes having implications for user interface design. These
are found under the "Device-Related Terms", "Results of Evaluation Codes", and
"Conclusion Codes." These should be valuable not only for device-reporting
purposes but also for in-house human factors training and evaluation.<P>

<i>Evaluating Devices Before Purchase</i><P>

Prior to buying a new model, you should consider means of assessing its
usability, especially if it is life-sustaining or life-supporting. Among the
things you can do are the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Ask the manufacturer if he has done human factors/usability testing. <P>
<LI>Check with your own people, and possibly other facilities, about predecessor
models made by the manufacturer. Check with other facilities, that may also be
using the new model, as well.<P>
<LI>Check published evaluations of the new model.<P>
<LI>Request a trial period prior to the actual purchase of a new device.</UL><P>

<i>Analyze and Test the Model</i><P>

In doing analyses and tests, there are a few points to keep in mind. Be careful
of biasing the users. The staff should know that <i>it is the device, not the
users,
being tested</i>. If this isn't made clear, users quite likely may feel that
their
performance on devices will be discussed with their superiors,  and thus they
will not be forthcoming about errors and related interface design deficiencies.
Also, should a device be evaluated during actual use on patients, data should be
collected over a reasonable length of time, not just a day or two. In real world
settings, actual problems often emerge slowly and require repeated observations
for identification.<P>

<b>Final Comment:</b> You can do a lot to assess devices you already are using,
as well
as those you are considering for purchase. When you uncover things you
particularly like or dislike, let the manufacturer know. Companies not only are
responsive to their customers, but they <i>want</i> to market medical devices
that meet
your needs for functionality, safety, and effectiveness.<P>

<center><h3>APPENDIX</h3></center><P>

<b>LIST OF KEY HUMAN FACTORS ISSUES</b><P>

In considering the need for, and conduct of, human factors analysis and testing,
there are a number of issues and questions to ask.<P>

<OL>
<LI>Does the device require much user interaction with respect to operation,
maintenance, cleaning, or parts installation? If so, do the technology and device
functions permit different alternative user interface designs?<P>

<LI>Given the combination of user interface, user population, and operating
conditions, are errors likely?<P>

<LI>Could the consequences of error be serious for the patient or user?<P>

<LI>In doing actual testing:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Is someone integral to the design team focusing on the user-related
issues?<P>
<LI>Are users involved?<P>
<LI>Are your hardware and software designers coordinating
their efforts with respect to human factors?<P>
<LI>Have you developed a test plan?</UL><P>

<LI>Have you developed user requirements, and are you updating them? Have you
checked the literature and your own files for useful human factors
information?<P>

<LI>What studies, analyses, and test steps are you performing? Are you examining
all relevant issues related to the installation of accessories and to device
operation.<P>

<LI>Have you done testing in simulated environments; actual environments?<P>

<LI>Have your user requirements been met?<P>

<LI>Have you accounted for any possible interface changes introduced into
production models by manufacturing?</OL><P>

<h2>DESIGN CONTROL GUIDANCE FOR MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS</h2>

<b>Draft: March 1, 1996</b><P>

This Guidance Relates To FDA 21 CFR 820.30 And Subclause 4.4 Of ISO 9001<P>

March 1996<P>

<center><h3>FOREWORD</h3></center><P>

This guidance is a primer on design controls. It is intended to provide readers
with an understanding of what is meant by "control" in the context of the
requirements. Medical device companies vary considerably in size and structure,
the types of devices produced, methods of design and development, and methods of
management. By providing readers with an understanding of what constitutes
control of a design process, readers can determine how to apply the concepts in a
way that is both consistent with the requirements and best suited for their
particular situation. For example, the scale of operation of a manufacturer can
have considerable impact on the manner in which design controls are implemented.
However, in order for the guidance to be complete, topics indirectly related to
the regulations such as product life cycle and concurrent engineering are
included. The following paragraphs describe additional concepts that should be
kept in mind while reading this guidance.<P>

First, three underlying concepts served as a foundation for development of this
guidance:<P>

<OL>
<LI>The nature of the application of design controls for any device should be
proportional to both the complexity of and the risks associated with that
device;<P>

<LI>The design process is a multifunctional one that involves other departments
beside design and development if it is to work properly. Consequently, senior
management should have an active role in creating an environment in which design
controls can be properly implemented; and,<P>

<LI>The product life cycle concept serves throughout this document as the
framework for introducing and describing the design control activities and
techniques.</OL><P>

Second, design control concepts are applicable to process development as well as
product development. The extent is dependent upon the nature of the product and
processes used to manufacture the product. For example, some in vitro
diagnostics, such as chemical entities, are totally dependent on new methods of
synthesis for their development. Another example is microchip manufacturing
technology that has made pacemakers possible.<P>

Third, the safety and performance of a new product is also dependent on an
intimate relationship between product design robustness and process capability.
Robustness is the ability of the product design to withstand manufacturing
variations and customer usage while still maintaining product quality. Process
capability is a statistical measure of functional stability. For example, a
sterilization process should be stable and capable of sterilizing a product, but
the product should also be designed to be sterilizable. For some product design
manufacturing method combinations, process capability might be proven and the
concern for robustness is minimal. In other combinations, either the design
should be made more robust, or the manufacturing process made more capable to
assure safety and performance.<P>

For completeness, it should be noted that processes can often be designed for
robustness as well. Such processes prevent defects in assemblies. For example, a
threaded fastener that depends upon a proper value of torque can be replaced by a
clip or snap joint, thus avoiding the need to control tolerances. Similarly, if
two wire connections are likely to be improperly connected, the choice of proper
lengths of wire can prevent connection to the wrong terminals.<P>

Finally, some tools and techniques are described in the guidance. Although
aspects of their utility are sometimes described, they are included in the
guidance for illustrative purposes only. Including them does not mean that they
are preferred. The literature contains an abundance of information on tools and
techniques. Such topics as project management, design review, process capability,
and many others referred to in this guidance are available in textbooks,
periodicals, and journals. As a manufacturer applies design controls to a
particular task, the appropriate tools and techniques used by competent personnel
should be applied to meet the needs of the unique product/process for that
task.<P>

<center><h3>1.0 GENERAL</h3></center><P>

Design controls are a set of interrelated techniques and activities that apply to
the design process to ensure that design process objectives are met. Concepts and
topics important to understanding design controls for medical devices and their
successful implementation are device quality, the device life cycle, sequential
versus concurrent engineering, risk management for safety, the role of senior
management, and quality systems.<P>

<b>1.1 DEVICE QUALITY</b><P>

The primary objective of the design process is the design of a quality device.
Describing device quality in technical terms, it is a measure of how closely
device performance matches intended performance over the expected range of
manufacturing variations and expected range of environmental conditions for the
intended use environment for the life of the device. However, device quality has
an even broader meaning. Quality means the totality of features and
characteristics that bear on the ability of a device to satisfy fitness-for-use,
including safety and performance (820.3 (s)). Therefore, a quality device is one
that meets user expectations, both stated and implied. Relating these concepts to
the design process, device quality is achieved by (1) developing design
requirements based on user expectations, and (2) designing a device that conforms
to those requirements, given the production capabilities of the manufacturer and
the expected range in variation of the process during device production.<P>

<b>1.2 DEVICE LIFE CYCLE</b><P>

The design and development of devices, particularly complex ones, is performed in
phases or stages. The phases are elements of a device life cycle model. A design
process that conforms to a life cycle model is preferred because the design
process proceeds in a systematic manner. A simplified diagram of the phases of a
waterfall life cycle model is shown in Figure 1. This particular model presents
the design process from the perspective of verification and validation
activities. A typical life cycle model might include those phases plus others for
production, installation, maintenance, repair, and disposal.<P>

This model represents a sequential design process. Each phase has defined inputs
and outputs. At the end of each phase, work products are completed. A design
review is conducted to assess work products, confirm conformance of outputs to
inputs, and determine if continued development of the device is warranted. If,
for this idealized process, the decision is to proceed, the outputs of a phase
then become the inputs to the next phase, ensuring input/output congruity with
preceding phases. The net effect is the transformation of design input
requirements into a product that conforms to those requirements.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/guide/xrayguide1.gif" alt="This flowchart is entitled Simplified Flow
Diagram of the Phases of the Waterfall Model Design Process"></center><P>

The phases and principal activities associated with each phase are the
following:<P>

<menu>REQUIREMENTS:  Design input requirements are established.<P>

SPECIFICATIONS:  Requirements are analyzed, and translated into
specifications.<P>

FUNCTIONAL:  Functions are established. The device functional architecture an,
lower-level functions are identified. Lower-level functions are translated into
design criteria.<P>

DESIGN/IMPLEMENTATION:  Product and process solutions are defined and analyzed. A
preferred set of solutions that satisfy functional requirements and define the
physical architecture of the device are selected. Detailed design is completed to
the extent required for implementation. The design is converted into hardware,
software, etc.<P>

TEST:  Testing occurs at the unit, integrated, and systems level to determine if
specifications are met.<P>

FIELD TEST:  Tests are conducted from a user-perspective to determine if user
expectations are met.</menu><P>

<b>1.3 CONCURRENT ENGINEERING</b><P>

Although the sequential design process serves as a useful method for introducing
the concept of conformance, the design process is dependent upon the completion
of one phase before beginning the next one. In practice, this can create
problems. For example, it may not be possible to complete the design input
requirements without acquiring information obtained through evaluation of a
prototype developed in a subsequent phase. Another example is the relationship
between the device design and the manufacturing process design. When constraints
are encountered during design of the manufacturing process that require
reconsideration of the device design, the manufacturing process designer may not
have sufficient knowledge of the device parameters to know which ones are
critical. Even with this knowledge, working with the device designers to make
changes in the device design may not be possible because of the advanced state of
development of the device.<P>

A design process that overcomes many of the problems associated with the
sequential design process is the concurrent engineering process. The goal of
concurrent engineering is the mutual optimization of the crucial characteristics
of a device and their related processes. To meet this goal, the device design,
manufacturing process design, and support process design occur concurrently. The
activities of these design teams is highly integrated including the exchange of
information and data. The teams attempt to mutually take into account all desired
downstream characteristics during the upstream design processes to produce a more
robust design that is tolerant of manufacturing and use variation. A
simplified representation of the upstream design processes is shown in Figure
2.<P>

In general, the concurrent engineering process is driven by scheduled events with
defined deliverables. Therefore, unlike the sequential design process, design
inputs will often initially include estimates so that the development process is
not delayed. The estimated values are replaced as information needed to establish
final values is acquired in the development process. As a result, care must be
taken to assure that design outputs continue to be traceable to the design input
requirements throughout the design process.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/guide/xrayguide2.gif" alt="This flowchart is entitled Simplified
Representation of Concurrent Engineering Upstream Design Processes"></center><P>

<b>1.4 Risk Management for Safety</b><P>

Risk management is the systematic application of management policies, procedures,
and practices to the tasks of identifying, analyzing, controlling, and monitoring
risk. It is intended to be a framework within which experience, insight, and
judgement are applied to successfully manage risk. Risk management encompasses
many different types of risk including technical, financial, contractual,
schedule, etc. Managing all relevant risks, regardless of type, should be an
integral part of the design process. However, because of the importance of
medical device user and patient safety, the description of risk management in
this guidance is directed to device safety. The principles and practices
described do apply to the management of other types of risk as well.<P>

Risk is the probable rate of occurrence of a hazard causing harm and the degree
of severity of the harm. A hazard is a potential source of harm. Harm, for the
purposes of this guidance, is physical injury and/or damage to health. Safety is
freedom from unacceptable risk of harm. Risk management activities include: (1)
program planning, (2) setting of risk criteria, (3) hazard identification, (4)
risk assessment, and (5) risk reduction and control.<P>

The risk management program is integrated with the design process and risk
management activities occur throughout the design process. Figure 3 is a
simplified flow-diagram of the risk management process.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/guide/xrayguide3.gif" alt="This flowchart is entitled Simplified Risk
Management Process For Device Safety"></center><P>

<i>1.4.1 Risk Analysis</i><P>

Risk analysis is the investigation of available information to identify hazards
and estimate risk. Risk analysis begins with hazard identification. Many tools
are available for identifying hazards and their cause such as fault tree analysis
(FTA) and, failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA). FTA is a technique that
begins with a potential consequence. Using deductive analysis, lower level fault
conditions that could cause the consequence are identified. FMEA is an inductive
technique by which the frequency and consequences of individual fault modes
related to product functions and components are systematically identified and
evaluated. The type of analysis tool that is used during any particular
development phase should be appropriate for that phase. Generally, deductive or
top-down analysis tools are used early in the design process while inductive or
bottoms-up tools are applied as the device design becomes more detailed. For
example, FTA can be used during conceptual design of the device for all possible
hazards including those from hardware, software, or use of the device.<P>

Risk estimation involves both the estimation of the likelihood of a hazard and
determination of the severity associated with a hazard. Because a hazard can have
more than one cause, estimating likelihood takes all causes into consideration.
Depending on the cause or causes, the method of estimation can be qualitative or
quantitative. Hazard severity is an assessment of the most credible worst case
mishap that could be caused by a hazard. Methods of severity assessment are
qualitative and employ categorization schemes.<P>

<i>1.4.2 Risk Reduction And Control</i><P>

The risk reduction and control activity involves the application of a hazard
control precedence sequence such as the following:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Design to eliminate or minimize hazard <P>
<LI>Provide safety mechanisms <P>
<LI>Provide warning mechanisms <P>
<LI>Control with labeling and training, i.e., the least reliable action <P>
<LI>Accept remaining hazards (Note: Justification and documentation may be
needed.)</UL><P>

The sequence is applied to the cause of each hazard in the order specified. The
preferred and most effective method for controlling the cause of a hazard is to
eliminate it or minimize it through redesign. If that is not possible, safety
mechanisms, such as isolation of a hazard by the use of physical barriers, might
be the next course of action. This procedure of risk control or reduction is
continued until the cause of each hazard has been eliminated or the risk
associated with each remaining hazard is reduced to an acceptable level. The
establishment of an acceptable level of risk may require justification.<P>

There are numerous sources of information available on risk management including
many textbooks on the subject. These sources can be used to acquire more detailed
information on principals and practices including the development and
implementation of risk management programs.<P>

<b>1.5 SENIOR MANAGEMENT</b><P>

Senior management establishes the context within which product design is
performed. It is their responsibility to: (1) decide how the design process is to
be managed and by whom, (2) ensure that adequate resources are available to carry
out the design process in the required time, and (3) ensure that internal
policies are established for issues affecting the design process.<P>

Selection of the project manager, who is responsible for control of the design
project, is a key responsibility. For large projects, senior management may also
establish the management structure for the project including defining the
authorities and responsibilities. If the project manager does not have
jurisdiction over manufacturing, senior management ensures that these functions
are integrated to the degree necessary for the project.<P>

Senior management ensures (1) that skills required for the project are available,
(2) that authorization is granted for training, hiring, and/or contracting for
missing skills, and (3) that required equipment and other resources necessary for
development of the manufacturing process are available.<P>

<UL>
<LI>assessing new product ideas,<P>
<LI>training and retraining of design managers and design staff <P>
<LI>use of external consultants<P>
<LI>subcontracting<P>
<LI>use of company experiential data</UL><P>

<b>1.6 QUALITY SYSTEM</b><P>

Quality system means the organizational structure, responsibilities, procedures,
and resources for implementing quality management (820.3 (v)). Authority for
establishing, implementing, and maintaining the quality system is delegated by
senior management to the manager with executive responsibility. The manager with
executive responsibility ensures that quality requirements for the project are
identified and understood by project management, and properly implemented. This
includes responsibility for establishing quality policies that impact the design
process.<P>

Example of topics for which policies may be appropriate are:<P>

<UL>
<LI>risk management<P>
<LI>device reliability<P>
<LI>device durability<P>
<LI>device maintainability<P>
<LI>device serviceability<P>
<LI>human factors engineering<P>
<LI>software engineering<P>
<LI>use of standards<P>
<LI>configuration management<P>
<LI>compliance with regulatory requirements<P>
<LI>device evaluation, including third party product certification/approval<P>
<LI>clinical evaluations<P>
<LI>the media to be used for the recording of the design information</UL><P>

For large or complex projects, quality system requirements may be in the form of
a project quality plan with defined objectives pertaining to key elements of
quality such as fitness for use, performance, safety, reliability, etc.<P>

<center><h3>2.0 DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PLANNING</h3><P>

<b>FDA 21 CFR 820.30 (b) &amp; ISO 9001 Subclause 4.4.2</b></center><P>

Design and development planning is needed to ensure that the design process is
appropriately controlled and that device quality objectives are met. Project
management, regardless of size and complexity, includes the identification of the
tasks to be undertaken and planning when tasks are to begin and end in order to
meet scheduling requirements, including completion of the project. It also
includes development of a list of project milestones, decision points, etc., with
required work products and required completion dates. This list is commonly
referred to as the master schedule. Therefore, to achieve these goals, the
project manager needs an effective method for organizing a network of
interrelated tasks and personnel in a manner consistent with the master schedule.
The method chosen and the detail will vary depending on the complexity of the
project and the level of risk associated with the device.<P>

Planning enables the project manager to have greater control of the design and
development process. Control is maintained by providing the project manager with
the ability to respond to unexpected problems. The design plan provides the
project manager with the capability to answer questions regarding timing of
project activities and evaluate the time and cost implications of resource
tradeoffs. It also provides a comparative reference for gauging progress and
detailing interrelationships between tasks.<P>

<b>2.1 PROJECT PLAN DEVELOPMENT</b><P>

The degree of difficulty in developing a plan is usually a function of the number
of activities or tasks, their sequence, their timing, and the complexity of the
device. For small projects, the plan may consist of only a simple flow diagram,
bar charts, or computer spreadsheets. For larger projects, there are a number of
tools that are used to develop plans. Two of the most commonly used are the
Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) and the Critical Path Method
(CPM). They are two forms of activity network diagrams. Another project
management tool is the Gantt chart. Gantt charts are used to document the
schedule, tasks, and responsibilities necessary to complete a project. Another
important factor affecting planning is the uncertainty associated with complex
tasks being performed for the first time. Contingency planning tools are
available to assist the project manager in selecting alternatives that have the
least serious consequences for the project. The master schedule is developed in a
hierarchical manner listing the accomplishments required for each milestone,
event, decision point, etc., as well as the criteria necessary to demonstrate
achievement.<P>

Each of these methods are described in the literature. Software is available in
many forms for the PERT, CPM, and Gantt methods. When selecting these tools, care
should be taken to choose one that best fits the needs of the project. Some of
the software programs are capable of managing projects such as skyscraper
construction and may be far more complex than necessary.<P>

<i>2.1.1 Organizing Tasks</i><P>

When design tasks have been identified, the estimated completion time,
responsibility, and necessary resources for tasks are established and the order
in which tasks are performed is determined. Tasks are organized according to the
stages of the design process and are consistent with the master schedule. The
design plan establishes, to the extent possible, the time involved for each stage
or phase, the resources and personnel involved and the allocation of
responsibilities. The plan identifies the numbers and types of staff required at
the various stages of the design process, whether all these staff can be found
within the manufacturers' organization, whether new staff is necessary, or
external consultant staff are required. Staff are organized into an appropriate
structure that can be effectively managed.<P>

Tasks for all design process activities including verification and validation are
included. If any clinical evaluation is necessary, any special documentation
required to comply with regulatory procedures is referenced in the plan.
Applicable codes, standards, regulations and specifications are referenced.
Quality assurance practices such as the scheduling of design review meetings,
configuration management activities, documentation requirements, and
authorization requirements are included. The relationships between tasks are
presented in such a way that they are easily understood. Schedules for the
development and delivery of products and processes are mutually supportive. Tasks
on which others depend, tasks that are performed concurrently, and complex tasks
being performed for the first time are evident. The plan is known and understood
by all those involved in the design process.<P>

<i>2.1.2 Expansion And Evolution Of The Plan And Master Schedule</i><P>

Generally, the master schedule and design plan expand over the course of the
project. Unless a manufacturer has experience with the same type of device, the
plan initially consists of only an overview of the tasks, personnel, and
resources required for the project. The master schedule will be limited in scope
and detail as well. The plan and master schedule usually reflect the level of
detail required by project management to make necessary decisions, and provide
confidence in meeting initial schedule and performance objectives. The initial
plan is typically used to identify the skills required for the project, and thus,
identify the members of the design team. As information about the product design
becomes available, the master schedule and plan are expanded and refined.<P>

Eventually, activities are specified at a level of detail necessary for carrying
out the design process in a manner that permits verification that the device
design meets specifications.<P>

The master schedule and design plan also evolve. Changing conditions require that
the project manager continually assess project progress and make appropriate
modifications to the plan and schedule. Inexperience in estimating the time
needed to complete tasks, personnel turnover, unexpected design constraints, and
insufficient resources are examples of the many factors that cause the schedule
and plan to be modified. Modifications to the master schedule and design plan are
approved by the project manager.<P>

<b>2.2 RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN</b><P>

Development of a plan for identifying and controlling hazardous conditions
associated with the device is the responsibility of the project manager. The plan
is developed in accordance with quality system requirements. The plan identifies
tasks that are performed and the resources required for completing those tasks.
Risk management milestones are identified and a meeting schedule is prepared. The
plan includes staff training requirements, the risk assessment and risk
acceptance criteria, the hazard control criteria, the hazard analysis techniques
to be used, and the hazardous condition tracking system to be used for the
project. The estimated time for completing tasks are specified as well as the
order in which tasks are performed. Reviews and milestones are also listed on the
plan. The plan is reviewed for appropriateness, completeness, and traceability to
the design input safety requirements.<P>

The project manager is responsible for (1) integrating the risk management plan
into the master schedule and design plan, (2) providing adequate resources for
risk management tasks, and (3) assuring that the risk management plan is properly
implemented. In some companies, specific positions might be designated for risk
management activities. In other cases, risk management activities are conducted
by individuals as a normal part of their job as designers. In either case, the
project manager assures that the results from risk management activities are
reviewed, and milestones are reached.<P>

Implementation of the plan begins very early in the project. A preliminary hazard
analysis is performed to identify the hazards associated with device concept.
Other risk management tasks are performed concurrently with the design process
and are performed in accordance with the plan. Upon completion of all risk
analysis, risk reduction, and risk control activities, results are reviewed to
ensure that all hazardous conditions are within acceptable limits and that the
device is safe. The project manager assures that the acquired information is
incorporated into the device design.<P>

<center><h3>3.0 ORGANIZATIONAL AND TECHNICAL INTERFACES</h3><P>

<b>FDA 21 CFR 820.30(b) &amp; ISO 9001 Subclause 4.4.3</b></center><P>

When participation in the design process includes a variety of individuals and
functions, their interrelationships and interfaces (as well as the pertinent
responsibilities and authorities) are defined, documented, coordinated and
controlled. For example, quality assurance and manufacturing engineers coordinate
efforts to assure that component and assembly blue prints are not released until
the production process FMEA provides assurance that parts are producible without
defects.<P>

<b>3.1 CONTROL OF INTERFACES</b><P>

Many organizational functions contribute to the design process. These may
include:<P>

<UL>
<LI>research and development<P>
<LI>reliability engineering<P>
<LI>marketing<P>
<LI>purchasing<P>
<LI>quality assurance and quality management<P>
<LI>engineering<P>
<LI>regulatory affairs<P>
<LI>materials technology<P>
<LI>production /manufacturing<P>
<LI>service groups<P>
<LI>facilities management<P>
<LI>warehousing/ transportation/ logistics<P>
<LI>communications facilities<P>
<LI>information systems</UL><P>

It is the responsibility of project manager to ensure that organizational and
technical interfaces associated with the design process are properly controlled.
Job descriptions define the areas of responsibility for members of the design
team. For a large design team divided into a number of groups, the
responsibilities of each group is defined in writing. Where specialist staff are
supporting more than one group or have other conflicting responsibilities,
methods to resolve such conflicts are established.<P>

To function effectively the work groups, both internal and external,
establish:<P>

<UL>
<LI>what information should be received and transmitted<P>
<LI>identification of sending and receiving groups<P>
<LI>the purpose of the information transmittal<P>
<LI>identification of transmittal mechanisms<P>
<LI>document transmittal records to be maintained</UL><P>

As the design progresses, more information becomes available. The ways in which
such information is held, who has access to it, and how it is disseminated is
determined and documented by the project manager. Methods are established to
resolve conflicting positions between groups.<P>

The facilitation of organizational and technical interfaces is a classic example
of working and managing in a matrix organizational structure. There are many
business texts devoted to operations management with emphasis on management
techniques for matrix organizations. For a full description of these techniques,
the reader should study such texts.<P>

<b>3.2 STRUCTURAL BARRIERS</b><P>

It is for senior management to identify structural barriers in the company that
could impede the design process. The degree to which structural barriers are a
problem generally depends upon the company size and organization. Structural
barriers may not be a problem for small companies. However, they can be a
significant problem for larger, highly structured companies. In addition,
identifying those barriers can be a very difficult task. Barriers can be
cultural, technological, or environmental such as the following examples
illustrate: (1) fixed patterns of interaction between engineering and
manufacturing are inappropriate for the design process; (2) each functional
component within the company retains information in a format and manner useful
only to themselves; and (3) the physical separation of functional components,
departments, etc. creates problems with information exchange and meeting
arrangements.<P>

Senior management can control the adverse effects resulting from such barriers by
conveying to company managers (1) the importance of the project within the
context of the company strategies, (2) the commitment of resources to the
project, (3) the authorities and responsibilities of project management, (4) the
responsibilities of function managers in supporting the design process, and (5)
the methods to be used by project management when barriers are encountered.<P>

<center><h3>4.0 DESIGN INPUT</h3><P>

<b>FDA 21 CFR 820.30 (c) &amp; ISO 9001 Subclause 4.4.4</b></center><P>

The design input provides the foundation for product development. The objective
of the design input process is to establish and document the design input
requirements for the device. The design input document is as comprehensive and
precise as possible. It contains the information necessary to direct the
remainder of the design process. It includes design constraints, but does not
impose design solutions. <P>

A key perspective in developing the design input is the customer's. Design input
is largely determined by customer requirements. To this end, knowledge of
customer expectations, patterns of use, concerns for safety and performance is
critical. However, the customer's is not the only perspective. All factors
pertinent to the design of the product are addressed. Among others this includes:
(1) regulatory requirements; (2) design aspects and processes that may require
development and analysis, including prototype testing, to verify accuracy; and,
(3) all factors necessary to describe the device throughout the device life cycle
including manufacturing, support, maintenance, and disposal.<P>

<b>4.1 TYPES AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION</b><P>

Simply put, the design input process consists of the identification and
documentation of requirements, as well as confirmation through independent review
of the adequacy of those requirements. The following is a partial listing of the
type of information that should be acquired:<P>

Needs of the user/patient<P>

<UL>
<LI>Diagnostic and/or therapeutic requirements<P>
<LI>Clinical effectiveness requirements including user expectations<P>
<LI>Labeling requirements including operator guidance<P>
<LI>Human factors<P>
<LI>Safety including biological safety<P>
<LI>Training</UL><P>

<LI>Environmental including EMC and device/system compatibility<P>
<LI>Reliability<P>
<LI>Maintainability, and reparability<P>
<LI>Storage and shelf life<P>
<LI>Materials including biocompatibility<P>
<LI>Regulatory (including GMP) requirements and standards<P>

<LI>Business considerations<P>
<LI>Installation<P>
<LI>Legal issues</UL>
<P>
Market research is the principal mechanism for acquiring knowledge of customer
requirements. It is through market research that detailed information regarding
where l and how it will be used, who will use it, concerns for safety, etc. are
obtained. Therefore, l the focus of information gathering is outside of the
company. This is particularly true for those projects involving new device
development. The market research may involve the selection and application of
particular research methods, the use of prototyping, or other means to acquire
the needed information. The reader should refer to texts on marketing research
for determining customer requirements and validating those requirements. Market
research is a professional expertise of its own. Depending on the nature of the
project, professional expertise should be considered.<P>

Other information can come from a variety of sources. It might already exist such
as documentation from past projects and studies, company complaints, and
servicing  records, and standards. It may have to be acquired first-hand such as
through a consultation with an appropriately qualified practitioner on the
consideration that needs to be given to the anatomical and physiological
implications of the intended use of the device. Or, for a device intended for
home use or a device used in ambulances, an investigation might be conducted by
company engineers at selected sites to characterize the environment in which the
device will operate.<P>

<b>4.2 DESIGN INPUT DEVELOPMENT</b><P>

The magnitude of the effort required to develop the design input depends on the
reasons for initiating the project as well as the type of device. The effort is
typically not as great for projects to upgrade or modify existing devices as that
required for a new device. In either case, development of the design input
requirements is best accomplished as a broadbased cross-functional activity. The
design input team includes representatives from all departments that contribute
to the design process: marketing, medical affairs, finance, general management,
manufacturing, the engineering functions, etc.<P>

Control of the development process is achieved through (1) employment of an
appropriate multifunctional approach, (2) documentation, and (3) formal review.
Meetings are conducted to review each requirement for explicitness, review the
list of requirements for completeness, resolve differences, and identify missing
information. Missing information such as warranty data on similar devices is
acquired, analyzed, interpreted, and the requirements list is expanded. Upon
determination that differences are resolved and the design input requirements
list is as complete as possible, it is subjected to a formal review, often the
first formal design review for the project, using established criteria such as
that listed in Section 4.3. If possible, the review is conducted by a
cross-functional team comparable to the team that developed the design input.
Upon formal acceptance of the design input requirements document, it becomes part
of the device configuration and the Design History File.<P>

<i>Requirements Checklist</i><P>

Checklists are a valuable tool when conducting a formal review. The following
checklist is an example of one of that might be used to review the design input
requirements:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Each requirement must be precise.<P>

<LI>Customer requirements are written in language to accommodate needs of a
cross-functional team. They may contain technical terminology, but are written so
that team members can understand the content.<P>

<LI>The means of validation (see Section 8.0) are specified for each requirement,
i.e., the conformance assessment procedure, methods, and equipment.<P>

<LI>The requirements are as complete as possible. Confirmation is provided that
all external requirements imposed on the product have been taken into account.
Similarly, confirmation is provided that appropriate consideration has been given
to all realizable classes of operating conditions, both valid and invalid.<P>

<LI>To be determined (TBD) conditions, i.e., incomplete requirements, are
identified. The conditions creating the TBD condition are specified and as well
as what needs to be done to eliminate those conditions.<P>

<LI>The document includes a record of all resolutions of any incomplete,
ambiguous, or conflicting requirements.<P>

<LI>The document is prepared in a way that facilitates updates. For example,
requirements are organized in an appropriate manner, e.g., by importance,
necessity, etc., and the document has a table of contents, an index, and explicit
cross-referencing.<P>

<LI>The document includes indication of "when" and "what criteria" will cause the
document to be updated, and who has responsibility for updates.</OL><P>

<b>4.3 DEVICE SPECIFICATIONS</b><P>

The design input requirements and measures to prevent known faults on similar
devices are translated into the device specifications. The specifications define
the essential technical characteristics of the device. To the extent possible,
device specifications are written in technical language, e.g., engineering
terminology, with characteristics described in terms that are measurable. Where
an allowable variation in a characteristic is permitted, the specifications
include the acceptable ranges or limits of variation. Thus, specifications are
verifiable.<P>

The translation process provides both forward and backward traceability to ensure
that specifications have not inadvertently been added in the translation.
Techniques such as quality function deployment (QFD) might be used to assure that
the translation occurs in a systematic manner that provides traceability. QFD is
a methodology for ensuring that specifications are coupled with requirements. In
addition, the means of verification is provided for each specification. The
specifications and means of verification are reviewed for precision, accuracy,
and completeness. The specifications are added to the device configuration and
the Design History File.<P>

<center><h3>5.0 DESIGN OUTPUT</h3><P>

<b>FDA 21 CFR 820.30 (d) &amp; ISO 9001 Subclause 4.4.5</b></center><P>

Design output means the results of a design effort at each design phase and at
the end of the total design effort. The total finished design output consists of
the device, its packaging and labeling, and the associated specifications and
drawings. It includes the production and quality assurance specifications and
procedures. Described in other terms, the design output includes (1) the detailed
documentation covering all functional and performance characteristics of the
device, including those related to safety, and (2) the product and process
documents needed to produce the device and maintain it throughout its life
cycle.<P>

Design output is generated throughout the design process. Examples of the types
of documents that are produced are the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>drawings<P>
<LI>test procedures<P>
<LI>performance test results<P>
<LI>specifications (including process and material specifications)<P>
<LI>work instructions<P>
<LI>software specifications and code<P>
<LI>quality assurance procedures<P>
<LI>installation and servicing procedures<P>
<LI>packaging and labeling specifications, including copies of approved labels<P>
<LI>methods and procedures</UL><P>

<b>5.1 USES OF DESIGN OUTPUT</b><P>

The design output is used for several different purposes such as the
following:<P>

<i>Documenting Conformance Of Output To Input</i><P>

Documentation confirming the conformance of design output to design input is
generated throughout the design process. For example, the device specifications
are reviewed for explicitness, accuracy, testability, safety, and traceability to
the design input requirements. The review is documented. Another example is
testing used to assess performance, safety, etc. at different stages of
development of the device. Test procedures, results, and assessments of those
results are documented as well as reviews of test procedures for accuracy,
completeness, and traceability. In totality, this documentation consists of all
design output generated by verification and validation activities.<P>

<i>Product And Process Documentation</i><P>

Some design outputs are used to generate other design output documents. For
example, design outputs are used to generate the product and process
documentation needed to produce the device and maintain it throughout its life
cycle.<P>

Such product documentation typically includes a parts list identifying all
purchased components. It includes materials specifications which specify, usually
by reference to standards, the characteristics of all materials needed to
manufacture the device and contains sufficient information for these materials to
be ordered by the purchasing department. It includes device packaging details,
examples of labels, and instructions for use, and instructions for the
installation and servicing of the device as well.<P>

The manufacturing process documentation that is generated defines how the device
will be produced. The documentation often includes a flow diagram showing the
sequence of operations performed in the manufacture of the device and work
instructions describing how each of the manufacturing operations is performed.
The work instructions identify the materials, components, tools and machines to
be used. They also describe the manufacturing operations and the test or
inspection procedures that show that the work has been properly done. The
documentation typically includes separate lists of the manufacturing equipment as
well as test and quality assurance inspection procedures.<P>

<i>Device History File (DHF) And Device Master Record (DMR)</i><P>

Design output provides the documentation used to compile files and records
required by regulation. The DHF documentation is compiled throughout the design
process. It includes or refers to the location of design documentation such as
the design input requirements, design verification results, design review
results, etc. The completed file provides a complete design history of the
finished device and demonstrates that the device design was developed, verified,
and validated in accordance with the approved design plan.<P>

The DHF contains information giving an overall picture of the design and
manufacture of the device such as block diagrams, outline drawings, flow
diagrams, etc., and can be maintained as a specific index file for the design
output. It includes identification of the next level of information and where it
can be found.<P>

The DMR is compiled in a similar manner. Once established, it is used and updated
throughout the full product life cycle. It contains device specifications,
production specifications, quality assurance procedures, packaging, and labeling.
It contains procedures for installation, maintenance, and servicing. Upon
completion, the DMR includes all of the detailed design documentation required
for production that is transferred to manufacturing.<P>

<i>Device Configuration</i><P>

During the design process, designers complete engineering drawings, flow
diagrams, source code, etc. These documents establish design criteria and are
required by others for further development of the device. For other designers to
use these documents, the documents are formally accepted, added to the device
configuration, and then released so that others may work with them.<P>

<b>5.2 CONTROL OF DESIGN OUTPUT</b><P>

Because of the number and types of documents that are generated as well as the
different ways in which they are organized and used, control of design output is
planned. The plan is implemented before design output is first generated. Key
components of the planning process are information and documentation flow
diagrams. They show graphically (1) where information and documentation is
generated, (2) where it is transmitted, (3) how it is used, and (3) where it is
stored.<P>

In general, the design output is organized and structured in a systematic manner
that facilitates accessibility, use, and updating of the documentation in a
manner that conforms with regulatory requirements and configuration management
procedures. The documentation incorporates means which provide traceability from
design outputs to the design input requirements. The documentation, including
copies of the latest version of the device configuration, is located where it is
used, e.g., engineering documents in the engineering department, purchasing
documents in the purchasing department, etc. It is complete and includes only the
latest version of each document. Obsolete documents are removed promptly and all
affected functions are notified. For records maintained for regulatory purposes,
documents are reviewed for adequacy prior to their being issued. Changes to
documents are documented, reviewed, and approved by the same function that
approved the original documents. The device configuration documentation system is
designed so that field problems can be traced to the date of engineering changes
and that all devices affected by the change can be identified.<P>

The documentation identification scheme provides means for individually
identifying each document that is consistent with (1) the various categories of
documents and (2) the manner in which they are stored. Care is taken in
establishing a document numbering system and in ensuring consistency in the use
of it throughout the documentation system. The system enables documents approved
and released for production to be distinguished from those not yet released.
Several texts are available on the subject of documentation control. The reader
is directed to these for a more comprehensive treatment of the subject.<P>

<center><h3>6.0 DESIGN REVIEW</h3><P>

<b>FDA 21 CFR 820.30 (e) &amp; ISO 9001 Subclause 4.4.6</b></center><P>

Design review refers to a proactive program of formal meetings that occur
throughout the design process. In general, design reviews are intended to (1)
provide a systematic assessment of the device and the associated designs for
production and support, (2) provide feedback to designers on existing or emerging
problems, (3) assess project progress, and (4) provide confirmation that the
project is ready to move on to the next stage of development. To meet these
goals, design reviews have both an internal and external focus. The internal
focus is on the feasibility of the design and the produceability of the design
with respect to manufacturing and support capabilities. The external focus is on
the user requirements, i.e., the device design is viewed from the perspective of
the user. The particular focus for any one design review meeting will vary
according to the stage of development of the device.<P>

<b>6.1 DESIGN REVIEW PROGRAM</b><P>

Control of the design review process is achieved by developing and implementing a
formal design review program consistent with quality system requirements.
Development of the program is the responsibility of the design review team. They
establish the meeting procedures, the meeting schedule, and variables checklists
that are appropriate for the stage of development. They also identify the
functions within the organization that should be represented at a meeting, e.g.,
for the design transfer meetings, they might require that all functions that
participated in the design be represented. The team also establishes procedures
for providing conditional acceptance of results. The evaluation criteria is
reviewed and updated as the design progresses.<P>

Formal reviews are planned in the master schedule and conducted at the end of
each phase and at important milestones in the design process. The following list
is an example of such a schedule. The number of meetings for any one phase
depends upon the complexity of the device.<P>

<b>Phase</b> (Number)<P>
<menu>
<b>Requirements Review (Design input)</b> (One to a few)<P>
<b>Functional Requirements Review</b> (One to a few)<P>
<b>Detailed Design Review #1</b> (Possibly several)<P>
<b>Detailed Design Review #2 (Post-verification)</b> (One to a few)<P>
<b>Design Transfer (Post-validation)</b> (One to several)</menu><P>

Prior to implementing the design review program, the team establishes
phase-specific criteria needed to demonstrate completion of a phase. They also
identify the supporting documentation required to make that assessment. In
preparation for each meeting, the documentation is assembled and reviewed.<P>

<b>6.2 DESIGN REVIEW TEAM</b><P>

The design review team plans, conducts, and records the design review meetings.
The multifunctional team is staffed by appropriately qualified personnel. The
team has at least one individual, assigned by management, who does not have
direct responsibility for design development. If possible, the other personnel on
the team are familiar with the details of the project but also not directly
involved in design development for the project. The competency of the
participants in the design reviews should be adequate to permit them to examine
designs and their implications.<P>

The team has sufficient authority to make decisions, provided that the design
remains within the overall constraints, such as:<P>

<UL>
<LI>to decide on and confirm the solution to be adopted<P>
<LI>to change the course of design<P>
<LI>to change to the- design input requirements<P>
<LI>to recommend additional research activity<P>
<LI>to conditionally accept results in accordance with established
procedures</UL><P>

<b>6.3 REVIEW PROCEDURES AND CHECKLISTS</b><P>

As previously stated, the nature of meetings changes as the design progresses.
During the initial stages, issues related to requirements and specifications
analysis will predominate. Next, the main function of the meetings is to review
the choice of solutions being offered by the design team. Then, issues such as
the choice of materials and the methods of manufacture become more important.
During the final stages, issues related to the verification of the design,
validation, and production predominate.<P>

However, all formal reviews are conducted in a similar manner. All formal
meetings are properly constituted with an agenda and recorded by minutes that
contain a dated action column. Material to be presented is distributed to other
participants in advance of the meeting so that it may be reviewed. The records
identify those present at the meeting and the decisions reached. Follow-up action
is monitored to assure that assignments are completed and all issues are properly
addressed.<P>

Finally, the following variables checklist is an example of one that might be
used in preparation for the formal review of design verification:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Do design outputs satisfy all design input requirements for the device
(including service)?<P>

<LI>Is the device design robust and process capable?<P>

<LI>Have risk management activities been performed to ensure that risk is within
acceptable levels?<P>

<LI>Do designs meet functional and operational requirements, that is, performance
and reliability objectives?<P>

<LI>Have appropriate materials and/or facilities been selected?<P>

<LI>Is there adequate compatibility of materials and components and/or service
elements?<P>

<LI>Is the design satisfactory for all anticipated environmental and load
conditions?<P>

<LI>Are components or service elements standardized and do they provide for
interchangeability, maintainability and replacement?<P>

<LI>Are plans for implementing the design, for example, purchasing, production,
installation, inspection and testing, technically feasible?<P>

<LI>Can the tolerance requirements consistently be met?<P>

<LI>Where computer software forms part of the product, or has been used in design
computations, modeling, or analyses, has the software (and its configuration
control) been appropriately validated, authorized, and verified?<P>

<LI>Have the inputs to such software, and the outputs, been appropriately
verified and documented?<P>

<LI>What are the assumptions made during the design process and what is their
validity?</UL><P>

<b>6.4 INFORMAL REVIEWS</b><P>

There is another type of review that occurs far more frequently and is an
integral part of the design process. Rather than being a component of a formal
program, these informal meetings occur as scheduled in project plans or on an
as-needed basis. The principal function of these meetings is usually to resolve a
problem or address issues in a specialty area. The meetings can be one-on-one,
few-on-few, etc. Usually, they are not multifunctional. They are an important and
necessary part of the development process. Those issues or problems that can be
addressed using informal meetings are resolved in that manner. As a result, many
important decisions, such as the selection of a design solution from among
alternatives presented, are made at informal meetings. Therefore, those decisions
and the rationale behind those decisions are recorded in the event that
unforeseen factors cause past design decisions to be reevaluated. However, all
decisions regarding problems or issues that will cause changes to specifications
or approved designs are made in the context of a formal, multifunctional design
review.<P>

<center><h3>7.0 DESIGN VERIFICATION</h3><P>

<b>FDA 21 CFR 820.30 (f) &amp; ISO 9001 Subclause 4.4.7</b></center><P>

Design verification is confirmation that design output meets design input
requirements (820.30(f)). Design verification has complementary global and local
meanings both of which apply to the design verification process. Globally, design
verification is the process by which conformance to design specifications is
confirmed and the question "did we design the device right" is answered. Locally,
verification is the process by which the output of a design activity is evaluated
to determine conformity with the input requirement for that activity. Therefore,
control of the design verification process is achieved by (1) ensuring that the
device specifications are verifiable and traceable to the design input
requirements, (2) planning and systematically verifying outputs of design
activities in a manner traceable to the design specifications, and (2) using the
formal design review process to determine if verification activities are
appropriate, consistent, complete, and traceable.<P>

<b>7.1 CONTROL OF DESIGN VERIFICATION</b><P>

Verification activities and tasks are conducted in every part of the design
process at all stages and levels of device design. The nature of verification
activities varies according the type of design output and the stage of the design
process. Verification activities include testing, inspection, analysis, review,
etc. Verification activities and tasks are planned. Planning usually includes
establishing the evaluation criteria, method of verification, and procedure to be
used. For example, one of the first verification activities may be a review of
the design specifications to ensure that they are complete, accurate, consistent,
verifiable, and traceable to the design input requirements. Design verification
activities and tasks include review of the results of FMEAs and FTAs and other
hazard analyses. Activities and tasks also include evaluation of the
appropriateness of design and process changes and the effectiveness of their
implementation. Whenever practical, verification activities and tasks are
performed by personnel other than those responsible for designing the work
product being evaluated.<P>

For large projects, a verification plan that relates verification activities and
tasks to the appropriate stage of development of the device may be necessary,
e.g., system-level verification activities may not be possible until prototype
development has been completed. The plan is reviewed for accuracy, completeness,
and to ensure that all activities are traceable to the design specifications.
Verification tasks are integrated into the project design and development plan.
Verification tasks are reviewed prior to beginning each new phase and changed
where necessary. Care is taken that, as the design progresses, verification
activities and tasks carried out at an early stage remain valid or are repeated
on the final design. The plan is used to convey to those conducting verification 
activities the importance of their activity within the entire verification
process.<P>

A major verification activity is the testing of the final device design.
Development of the  test plan usually begins during the design specifications
phase. The plan includes  performance, environmental, reliability, and safety
testing. Encountering conflicting  requirements, unforeseen design constraints,
changes in implementation, etc. can require  that the plan be changed. Therefore,
the test plan is revised and updated as the design  proceeds. The completed plan
includes detailed test procedures that take into account  worse-case operating
conditions. It includes acceptance criteria that is tied to the design 
specifications. Where criteria or procedures are based on standards, those
standards are  identified. Tools such as trace matrices are used to ensure that
all device specifications  have been accounted for and that testing is traceable
to the design specifications.<P>

Results generated from verification activities are analyzed and interpreted.
Correction of  any problem that is identified begins at the point in the design
corresponding to where the  problem originated. The results, analyses,
interpretations, as well as the identification of  individuals that performed
verifications are recorded and added to the Design History File  along with the
results of all other verification activities and tasks. <P>

Formal design reviews are an important part of the design verification process.
It is  during the formal design review process that determination of the adequacy
of the  verification activities is made while taking into account factors such as
conflicting design  requirements, unforeseen constraints, etc. Formal reviews are
also used to confirm  traceability of design outputs to the design
specifications. Therefore, the decisions made  during the review process are an
important part of the design process and are documented  in the design review
report prepared by the review team chairperson.<P>

<b>7.2 VERIFICATION TECHNIQUES</b><P>

Many different techniques can be used in the verification process. Analyses
including  failure analyses, alternative calculations, testing including animal
testing, auditing, design  reviews, demonstrations, and comparing a new design to
a proven design are examples of  verification techniques. (Auditing refers to any
independent examination of a design  output and not a quality audit.)<P>

Fault tree analyses (FTA), failure mode and effects (FMEA) analyses, and other
hazard  analysis techniques can be used as verification methods throughout the
design process.  The analysis techniques are applicable to more than verification
of conformance to safety  specifications, and can be used for process
verification as well.<P>

For most verification techniques, the verification procedures include evaluation
for both normal and unusual, e.g., out-of-range or invalid, operating conditions.
An example is the verification of software. As software design progresses, each
module is challenged by an independent team within the design group. Their task
is to examine the software under several extreme combinations of conditions
including testing that attempts to "defeat or fool" it.<P>

Most aspects of product design can be verified by in vitro testing, but some
medical devices may require animal and/or clinical testing. Such testing is only
undertaken (1) when it can be shown that there are aspects of the design that
cannot be verified by in vitro testing and (2) when in vitro testing has shown,
as far as possible, that the product is safe and satisfactory. Animal testing
precedes clinical testing and is be carried out against procedures which have
clear end points and which are designed to minimize animal suffering. The
procedures are reviewed prior to the initiation of testing to ensure that it is
possible to achieve the desired end points and that appropriate controls are in
place.<P>

When alternative calculations or comparison with a proven design are employed as
forms of design verification, the appropriateness of the alternative calculation
method and/or the proven design is reviewed in relation to the new
application.<P>

<center><h3>8.0 DESIGN VALIDATION</h3><P>

<b>FDA 21 CFR 820.30 (g) &amp; ISO 9001 Subclause 4.4.8</b></center><P>

Design validation means establishing by objective evidence that a device conforms
with user needs and intended uses (802.3 (z)(2)). The intent of design validation
is to go beyond the purely technical issues of verifying that the design output
meets the design input, and is intended to ensure that the device meets user
requirements. Conceptually, device validation is performed with respect to the
design input requirements and answers the question "did we design the right
device." However, in a manner similar to design verification, control of the
validation process is achieved by (1) planning for validation including the
development of procedures, evaluation criteria, etc., and (2) using the formal
review process to both evaluate the appropriateness of plans and review results
for completeness, accuracy, and traceability. If possible, design validation is
performed by an independent team familiar with the details of the project but not
directly involved in the design process.<P>

Planning for validation begins early in the design process. The performance
characteristics, features, etc. that are to be assessed are identified.
Acceptance, criteria should be established for each characteristic, feature, etc.
Worse case and unusual operating conditions are taken into account when
establishing the criteria. Where standards are the source of criteria, the
standards are specified. The characteristics, features, etc. and the acceptance
criteria are reviewed for appropriateness, completeness, as well as traceability
to the design input requirements.<P>

Design validation is performed under defined operating conditions on initial
production units, lots, batches, or their equivalents. Design validation can
include testing under actual or simulated use conditions. Therefore, before
procedures can be developed, the manner in which validation is to be performed,
and thus, the operating conditions for the method are identified. Assessments of
some characteristics, features, etc. might be performed under actual use
conditions while simulated conditions are used for others.<P>

Depending upon the type of device, procedures may have to be established for
several different assessment methods, e.g., clinical evaluations, safety
assessments, etc. Careful consideration is given to whom the user really is, the
operating instructions, and any restrictions on the use of the product. Careful
consideration is also given to the acceptance criteria as well as the capability
of an assessment method to produce the desired end points. All information
relevant to a procedure, such as the statistical methods to be used, is
specified. Where standards are the source of procedures, those standards are
specified.<P>

Evaluation of results is an important part of the validation process. Design
validation normally follows successful verification that the finished product
conforms to the device specifications. It forces a reconsideration of the design
input and whether user requirements were properly conveyed to the designers.
Problems identified during validation are corrected at the point in the design
process corresponding to where the problem originated. When validation has been
completed, the results are analyzed and interpreted. Conclusions are developed
and recorded. Methodology, results, analyses, interpretations, and conclusions
are evaluated as part of the formal design review process. The design validation
results, analyses, interpretations, etc. are documented in the Design History
File.<P>

<center><h3>9.0 DESIGN CHANGES</h3><P>

<b>FDA 21 CFR 820.30 (i) &amp; ISO 9001 Subclause 4.4.9</b></center><P>

Design changes occur throughout the design process. Often, assessing the impact
of changes on all aspects of the project can be very difficult. This is
particularly true for large projects involving multifunctional design teams.
Therefore, control of changes is achieved by establishing, applying, and
maintaining procedures for the identification, documentation, validation and
verification where appropriate, review, and approval of design changes before
their implementation (820.30(i)).<P>

Examples of changes that need to be controlled are:<P>

<UL>
<LI>new design criteria is added to the existing documentation as project
milestones are reached<P>
<LI>change in design inputs<P>
<LI>omissions or errors, e.g., due to calculation, material selection, etc.,
during the design phase have been identified afterwards<P>
<LI>manufacturing and/or installation difficulties are discovered after the
design phase<P>
<LI>the purchaser or subcontractor requests changes<P>
<LI>the function or performance of the device is to be improved<P>
<LI>safety, regulatory, or other requirements have been changed<P>
<LI>design verification or validation necessitates change</UL>
<P>

<b>9.1 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT</b><P>

In general, for any approved document, subsequent changes to that document are
approved by the same authority that approved the original design. In addition,
the request for a change is accompanied by an assessment of the total impact of
the change. However, for documentation that has been placed under configuration
control, changes to those documents are made in accordance with the established
configuration management plan.<P>

Configuration management refers to the documentation to be controlled, the
procedures for controlling it, and the responsibilities of those managing the
documentation, i.e., the configuration control board. It includes a system of
traceability including traceability of components, service manuals, procedures,
etc. that could be affected by a change. The controlled documents are
configuration items and collectively form the device configuration. Typically,
the device configuration includes specifications, design documents, test
documents, and all other deliverables including those documents required for
regulatory records. In other words, the configuration is the continually
increasing set of formally reviewed and accepted documentation that throughout
the project (1) establishes the current development status of the device, (2)
provides traceability to the design input requirements, and (3) serves as the
basis for further development. However, it is the responsibility of the project
manager to decide, in a manner consistent with the quality system requirements,
which documents are to be place under configuration control. Detailed
documentation flow diagrams are included in the plan.<P>

The configuration management plan is established during the design input
requirements phase. The procedures contained in the plan identify the documents
to be placed under configuration management and establish when, in their state of
development, they are placed under configuration control. For example, for some
projects, only documents that are completed and formally accepted are placed
under configuration management. For other projects, documents containing
to-be-determined conditions are placed under configuration control.<P>

All changes affecting the configuration are reviewed by the change control board.
The criteria for evaluating proposed changes is established in the quality
plan.<P>

The procedures for controlling change include methods for the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>controlling the identification of development status<P>
<LI>requesting and approving changes<P>
<LI>ensuring that changes are properly integrated through formal change control
procedures<P>
<LI>obtaining approval to implement a change<P>
<LI>version identification, issue, and control</UL><P>

Change control procedures require the complete documentation of approved changes
and the communication of configuration changes to all who are affected. Design
changes are reviewed to determine whether they influence previously approved
design verification or validation results.<P>

<center><h3>10.0 DESIGN TRANSFER</h3><P>

<b>FDA 21 CFR 820.30 (h)</b></center><P>

The process of transferring knowledge about the device from the design team to
the manufacturing group, which will build the product, does not normally take
place at one time but preferably is carried on throughout the design process. The
knowledge may be transferred in the form of documentation, training and possibly
by the transfer of personnel.<P>

The transfer of a device design to production typically involves review and
approval of specifications, procedures, and critical product and process
characteristics established in the FMEAs, FTAs, and hazard analyses. Where
applicable, it includes confirmation of the adequacy of specifications, methods
and procedures through process validation, including the reliability and
durability testing of finished product under actual or simulated use
conditions.<P>

Incorporation of manufacturing and production personnel in the design review team
is an important element of design transfer. As each subsystem of the design is
completed, examples of that design element are manufactured under as near-normal
manufacturing conditions as possible by the manufacturing personnel under the
supervision and guidance of the designers. This enables any deficiencies in the
documentation to be identified as well as any practical difficulties in
constructing the device. At this stage, each subsystem is tested. The culmination
of this process is the construction of several complete examples of the finished
product which are those used for final device verification/validation or clinical
trials. However, only when the subsystem documentation and performance is
verified at the systems-level, is subsystem considered ready for release and the
Device Master Record completed.<P>

It may not be possible to determine the adequacy of full-scale manufacturing on
the basis of successfully building prototypes or models in a laboratory and
testing these prototypes or models. The engineering feasibility and production
feasibility may be different because the equipment, tools, personnel, operating
procedures, supervision and motivation could be different when a company scales
up for routine production. One way to ensure that distributed devices have the
quality attributes established during design, and that these are not adversely
affected by the production process, is to manufacture finished devices using the
approved specifications, the same materials and components, the same production
and assessment equipment, and the same methods and procedures that will be used
for routine production. In addition, manufacturing can use the opportunity to
develop screening methods for identifying manufacturing defects.<P>

Where appropriate, this may be accomplished by manufacturing "pilot runs" or
"first production runs. These devices, or samples from these runs, are then
qualified through testing under actual or simulated use conditions, and in the
environment, or simulated environment, in which the device is expected to be
used. The extent of the testing should be governed by the complexity and risk
associated with the device.<P>

<center><h3>11.0 CONCLUSIONS</h3></center><P>

The manner in which design controls are implemented by a device manufacturer is
affected by many factors such as scale of operation, device risks, and current
design practices. Virtually all device manufacturers employ activities and
techniques that are the same or similar to those described in this guidance,
e.g., project planning, design reviews, etc. Therefore, before implementing
design controls, manufacturers should evaluate their existing design process and
identify process deficiencies that could cause device nonconformance. Design
controls should then be implemented in a manner that is consistent with the
guidance, is best suited for their existing process, and addresses those
deficiencies. Finally, design controls are an interrelated set of activities and
techniques. Therefore, failure to implement "all" of the controls can be a cause
of device nonconformance. For example, a design process can include adequate
activities for planning, review, verification, validation, etc. However, failure
to properly develop the design input requirements can cause significant design
deficiencies that may not be detected until the design is validated.<P>

burying glassified waste directly in groundwater, and having so little

would be radioactive!

<h3>Journal Article Review</h3>
<h1>High-Level Waste Glass: Field Leach Test</h1>
<h3>Nuclear Technology, January 1977</h3>
</center>

<img src="/graphics/gifs/stripe.gif">
<p>

<b>REVIEWERS SUMMARY:</b>Twenty-five blocks of glassified hi-level
waste were buried below the water table at Chalk River in 1958.  The
transit time would be some six half-lives of SR-90 for the 500 meters
to Perch Lake, by which time the SR-90 would be only 5 millicuries /
year to Perch Lake and thence to Ottawa River for a storage of wastes
from a 30,000 MWe nuclear industry.

<hr>

Nuclear Technology is published by American Nuclear Society to publish
review papers and unreported work of all phases of applications of
fundamental research to nuclear technology. The January 1977 issue
contains this article, one of a series of papers given at the June 16,
1976 ANS-CNS meeting in Toronto Canada. The articles are on Materials
in Waste Storage.:

<blockquote>
<b>HIGH-LEVEL WASTE GLASS: FIELD LEACH TEST</b>, pages 88 - 91<br>
<i>by W. F.  Merritt, Chalk River Nuclear Laboratory</i>
</blockquote>   

To study a worst case scenario, 25 blocks of hi-level waste glassified
in nepheline syenite were buried below the water table at Chalk River
in 1958.  Then in 1960, 25 other blocks were similarly buried, after
preparation from poorer glass. Groundwater past the blocks is 18
centimeters/day.  After some 10 years, leach rates of SR-90 were 3.5
microcuries per year.  For a storage of wastes from a 30,000 MWe
nuclear industry, the transit time for the 500 meters to Perch Lake
would be some six half-lives of SR-90, by which time the SR-90 would
be only 5 millicuries / year to Perch Lake and thence to Ottawa
River. Presently there are 50 millicuries / day of weapons testing
SR-90 passing CRNL in the Ottawa River.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION:</b> Burial directly in the soil would be feasible for
permanent storage from a 30,000 MWe nuclear power industry.

<hr>

<b>REVIEWER'S COMMENTS:</b> Buried in old reports is the twenty year
R&amp;D basis for safe disposal of high level radioactive waste. Since
the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, most of the effort has gone into
the location and characterization of potential field locations for a
burial site.  Little new work has been more significant in showing the
relative ease of this safe disposal -- making this old work more
valuable as time progresses.

<h3>ANS On-line Publications Ordering</h3>
<h1>Understanding Payment Options</h1>
<p>
<img src="/graphics/gifs/stripe.gif">
<p>
<table width=600><tr><td>
There are currently a number of available options to pay for your
on-line ANS Publications order.  In all cases, after filling out the
on-line order form and indicating your payment option and you
will receive a confirmation number.  This number will be important in
all the payment options.
<dl>
  <dt> <b>Direct Credit Card Payment</b>
  <dd> <blink><b>THIS IS NOT A SECURE SERVER!</b></blink> For those
       people who are of the valid opinion that sending their credit
       card info over the internet is no more dangerous than giving
       the card to a restaurant waiter for 10 minutes or reading it
       over a normal phone line, it is possible to enter the
       type, number, and expiry date directly on the form and complete
       your transaction.
       <p>
  <dt> <b>Telephone/Fax Credit Card Payment</b>
  <dd> You can either phone <i><b>1-800-NUCLEUS</b></i> and leave
       your name, credit card information, and confirmation
       number,<p>
       <i>OR</i><p>
       Fax your name, credit card info and confirmation number to
       <b><i>(708)352-0499</i></b>.
       <p>

  <dt> <b>Cheque or Money Order</b>
  <dd> Send a cheque or money order in U.S. Funds and indicating your
       confirmation number to:<p>

       <blockquote><blockquote>American Nuclear Society<br>
       P.O. Box 72475<br>
       Chicago, Illinois 60678-2475<br>
       USA</blockquote></blockquote>
       <p>

  <dt> <b>Wire Transfer</b>
  <dd> Wire transfer funds to:<p>

       <blockquote><blockquote>Account No. 824941<br>
       American National Bank<br>
       33 N. LaSalle St.<br>

       USA</blockquote></blockquote>
</dl>
<p>

In all cases, you will receive an e-mail from ANS Staff once your
payment has been received using your confirmation number to indicate
that your order is being processed.

<title>Forms and CGI Templates for ANS Documents</title>
</head>

<body background=/graphics/gifs/logo.bkgrnd.gif>
<center>
<table width=600><tr><td>

<center><h1>Forms and CGI Scripts</h1></center>
<img src="/graphics/gifs/stripe.gif">
<p>

These collections of HTML forms and accompanying CGI scripts are
currently used to process ANS on-line applications.  Please read the
comment which accompanies each, since their usage is more complicated
than a standard HTML template.
<p>

Most ANS forms, particularly those involving payments, use a two step
process.  The data from the initial form is processed by a CGI script
and then a confirmation page [CGI-generated HTML] is shown.  On the
confirmation page, the user will see a concise summary of their
selections including an itemized and totalled bill.  By submitting
this information, the user receives a coded confirmation number and
the information is sent to ANS HQ.  Most forms use tables in their
construction (a virtual necessity), and therefore require slightly
more sophisticated browsers.  (It is probably possible to make this a
single script, but I haven't done it yet :) <p>

Most CGI scripts uses two common routines that check for a valid
looking e-mail address and ensure that mandatory information is
provided, respectively.  These two things are important given the ANS
HQ philosophy that they can follow up on missing or incorrect
information if they have enough contact information to do so.  If
either routine fails a complete error message page is shown indicating
which information is missing and suggesting that the user use the
"Back" button to correct missing or invalid information.
<p>

The currently used scheme for calculating a confirmation number is a
loosely encoded, non-random string created from some 4 letter code
word and the date and time stamp of the initial form submission.
Little need was seen for further development of this number since it
is more of a tracking number than a security number.
<p>

Finally, any form which allows direct credit card payment methods must
include a link to a warning that this is not a secure sever.  The
current message does point out that the risk is perhaps not significant
relative to giving a credit card to a waiter or giving the number over
the phone, but does allow the user to choose.
<p>

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Conference Registration</b>
  <dd> The form shown here was used for on-line conference
       registration for the 1996 ANS/ENS International Meeting.  Most
       meeting registration forms are separated in sections in this
       way, with there always being a section on each of:
       <table><tr>
       <td>
       <ul>
	 <li> personal data,
	 <li> conference fees,
	 <li> special publications options,
       </ul></td><td>
       <ul>
	 <li> special event tickets,
	 <li> professional development workshops, and
	 <li> payment options.
       </ul></td>
       </tr></table>

       In addition to changes which must be made in the appearance of
       the form for each new conference, changes must be made in the
       HTML form code to match the form data to the CGI script for
       changing special events, professional development workshops and
       special publications options.  This usually consists of slight
       changes to the form variable names and changes in the dollar
       values associated with each in the CGI script.

	 <center><h1>Generate Registration Form and Script</h1>
	 <img src=/graphics/gifs/stripe.gif></center>

	 This form should help you generate an on-line form to allow
	 registration for your conference or meeting.  Simply fill out
	 the data below, and submit this form.  When the results
	 appear, use your browser to save them as a file with the
	 appropriate name.  At the same time, the script necessary to
	 process your form will be automagically created and sent to
	 the ANS Webweavers' Guild.  You are therefore encouraged not
	 to change the form once you have saved it.

<h3>ANS HQ HTML Primer</h3>
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
</center>
<img src=/graphics/gifs/stripe.gif>

<h3>What is the Internet?</h3>

The internet has been much in the news in the last few years, but what
is it?  The internet is really a large network of cables and
fiber-optics which criss-crosses the country and the globe connecting
computers to each other.  The internet allows the transfer of data in
many formats including e-mail, news, file transfer, and so on.  There
is a so-called "back-bone" around the country which carries most of
the information at the highest speeds.  There are branches off this
backbone, and further branches from these branches.  As a rule, each
branch carries less data than the trunk it branched from.

<h3>What is the World Wide Web?</h3>

A few years ago, some researcher at CERN in Switzerland decided that
there should be easier ways to share information on this powerful
network.  Basically, the technology for sharing information had not
kept pace with the capabilities of the network itself.  They developed
this concept of the World Wide Web [WWW] which is based on the concept
of hypertext, text which allows you to jump quickly between documents
and sections of documents.  Physically, the WWW is simply the
Internet, as described above.
<p>

What make it different between the WWW and the internet then?  The WWW
allows us to use this physical internet more efficiently, jumping
between documents which may be in completely different places around
the world, viewing images, listening to sounds, and so on.
<p>

While the WWW was originally based on hypertext, and the HyperText
Transfer Protocol (more on this below), most people now include most
of the possible communication methods on the internet in the
definition of the WWW.

<h3>Glossary</h3>

Since many of the terms may be new, I will introduce them at the
beginning rather than at the end, as in most references.  Most of
these definitions are not really important in terms of continuity.
Therefore, if you don't quite understand something, read on, hopefully
it will become more clear (or unnecessary :).

<dl>
  <dt> <b>HyperText Markup Language [HTML]</b>
  <dd> This is the basic formatting tool of the original WWW.  This
       markup language allows us to format the text we share on the
       WWW, much as a word processor allows us to format the text we
       share on paper.  There is one important difference: a markup
       language is designed to give basic typesetting suggestions
       which are then interpretted individually by the reader while a
       word processor gives final formatting rules.  More on this in
       the next chapter.
       <p>

       Markup languages in general are really quite simple.  "Tags"
       are added to a simple text document to give these typesetting
       suggestions.  In HTML a tag is enclosed in angle brackets,
       "&lt;tag&gt;", and most tags have a beginning and an end.  This
       concept will be quite familiar to people who work with other
       typesetting languages (eg. LaTeX) and with people who work
       often with the "Reveal Codes" mode of WordPerfect.  The next
       chapter will describe how to use the various tags of HTML to
       format a document.
       <p>
  <dt> <b>Protocol</b>
  <dd> A protocol is simply a method of exchanging information.  There
       are many protocols of various ages and sophistications.  All of
       you have used such a protocol if you have sent e-mail, browsed
       the web, or read news on-line.  Some of the protocols are:
       <p>

       <dl>
	 <dt> <i>HyperText Transfer Protocol [HTTP]:</i>
	 <dd> the basis of the WWW, this protocol allows the transfer
	      and interpretation of HTML and other documents.  It one
	      of the newest and most sophisticated protocols.
	 <dt> <i>File Transfer Protocol [FTP]:</i>
	 <dd> an older protocol which allows the simple transfer of
	      files in text or binary format.  This protocol is used
	      often by people wishing to share files and information
	      which is too big to send by e-mail.
	 <dt> <i>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [SMTP]:</i>
	 <dd> this is the protocol used to send e-mail messages around
	      the internet.  You may never encounter this directly,
	      but somewhere in your system, there is a program
	      (server) which uses this protocol to send your messages
	      out the the internet and recieve others.
	 <dt> <i>Gopher:</i>
	 <dd> This protocol developed at the U of Minnesota was a
	      predecessor to HTTP and the WWW.  It allows people to
	      share files in a way similar to HTTP, but there is no
	      formatting and graphics.
	 <dt> <i>Network(?) News Transfer Protocol [NNTP]:</i>
	 <dd> This is the protocol used to spread electronic newsgroup
	      messages around the world.  If you read news on the
	      internet, it has probably been send, at some point, with
	      this protocol from where is began to where you read it.
       </dl>
       <p>
       
       Of these, the most important are probably HTTP and FTP, and
       less so Gopher.
       <p>
  <dt> <b>Server</b>
  <dd> The term server used to refer to two related things: the
       physical computer which is making information available with
       one of the above protocols and the software which is running on
       that computer to implement the protocol.
       <p>

       For example, the ANS Home page is made available on a 'server'
       (computer) called "www.ans.org" using an HTTP server (software)
       called APACHE.
       <p>

       In this case, the most important of these two is the physical
       computer meaing.  It is used in addresses given on the internet
       as URL's... see next definition.
       <p>
  <dt> <b>Uniform Resource Locator [URL]</b> (often pronounced like
       the name "Earl")
  <dd> This is the way that addresses are indicated on the WWW.
       Surely, by now, most have you have seen addresses like:

       <table border=1><tr>
       <td>http://www.ans.org/</td><td>(ANS WWW Server)</td>
       </tr><tr>
       <td>http://www.ans.org/membership/</td><td>(ANS WWW Server membership section)</td>
       </tr><tr>
       <td>http://www.ans.org/membership/form.html</td><td>(ANS On-line membership form)</td>
       </tr><tr>
       <td>http://www.nytimes.com/</td><td>(New York Times on-line)</td>
       </tr><tr>
       <td>http://www.7up.com/</td><td>(7up soft drink commerical home page)</td>
       </tr></table>

       in TV commericals, print ads, or email from people like me :).
       These are all examples of URL's.  You can probably already see
       the basic format of a URL:
       <p>

       <center><code>protocol://server/</code></center>
       <p>

       The above examples are all URL's for the HTTP protocol.  Other
       possibilities are:
       <p>
       
       <blockquote><blockquote>
       <code>
       ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/           (A shareware software archive)<br>
       gopher://gopher.wisc.edu/      (The UW-Madison Gopher server)
       </code>
       </blockquote></blockquote>

       Some other protocols use slightly different formats:
       <p>
       
       <blockquote><blockquote>
       <code>
       news:sci.energy		       (newsgroup about energy)<br>
       mailto:wilson@maple.fzk.de     (send mail to this author)
       </code>
       </blockquote></blockquote>

       There will be more info on URL's when we discuss how to link
       documents together.

<TD>Dear Colleague:</TD>

<TD ALIGN=RIGHT>February, 1997</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>The American Nuclear Society is sponsoring an Executive Conference on
Decommissioning and Spent Fuel Disposal, April 27-30, 1997, in Vancouver,
Washington. The conference will address the comprehensive and cost-effective
approaches that have been applied to decommissioning and the disposition
of spent fuel. Dedicated scientists, engineers, technicians, and federal
and state regulators who have extensive knowledge in the planning and implementation
of decommissioning and spent fuel management programs are participating
in this conference to share their experiences.</P>

<P>The technical program will highlight such topics as resolving issues
associated with prompt decommissioning at the Trojan Nuclear Plant, and
Nuclear Energy Institute initiatives related to decommissioning and long-term
spent fuel management, as well as public perception of the decommissioning
and management of spent fuel at nuclear power facilities. Other topics
such as major activities and projects, and the options, challenges, and
solutions concerning decommissioning and the disposition of spent fuel
will also be addressed. The topics will include on-site and off-site low-level
radioactive waste and mixed-waste management and industry experience in
termination survey programs and decommissioning cost management systems.
As part of the conference, we will spend a day at the Trojan Nuclear Plant,
which is currently being decommissioned and whose spent fuel will be transferred
to an independent spent fuel storage installation on site. While Trojan
will be highlighted, lessons learned at other decommissioning plants, and
industry and regulatory views on emerging issues will be discussed. The
tour will be augmented with a technology fair at which several companies
will demonstrate decommissioning and spent fuel management technologies.
If your company wishes to participate in the technology fair, please contact
R. Jon Stouky at (910)316-0707 or (910)316-0550 (FAX), or e-mail at jstouky@aol.com.</P>

<P>The conference will be preceded by a visit to the world famous Astoria
Seafood Festival on Saturday and a no-host organized golf tournament on
Sunday. During the week, a visit to the famous Pendelton wool outlet store
and a tour of the Columbia River Gorge will give spouses/guests the opportunity
to take advantage of the fabulous prices at the outlet store and to have
lunch on the scenic Columbia River. </P>

<P>Please review the Advance Program. We believe that this conference will
be a great opportunity to learn what has been accomplished recently in
decommissioning and spent fuel disposal. We look forward to your participation
at this important conference. </P>

<i><b>"NRC Gives Perry Plant Good Marks on Safety"</b><br>
CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER, 3/13/96, p. 3B</i><br>
Jim Nichols
<p>

Hubert J. Miller, chief of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Region
III office, gave the Perry nuclear power plant in Ohio an "upbeat
review," saying the plant appears to be reversing its "dismal record."
<p>

Miller: "What we're looking for at this point is continued, steady
improvement, and I think that's what we're seeing."  He said that a
detailed inspection during the plant's current refueling shutdown
"found no significant safety concerns" and inspectors are "pleased" by
the plant's maintenance program.
<p>

But Miller said the NRC would be "more vigilant" -- at Perry and
nationwide -- in the wake of a Time magazine article that portrayed
the NRC as "overly chummy" with the nuclear power industry and
"hostile" to whistleblowers.  He added, however, that if plant
operator Centerior Energy Corp. continues to improve the plant, it
should have "little cause for concern."
<p>

Last year Perry operated 900f the time, best in its ten- year
history.  Investigators also found that a "recurring problem" at Perry
- - leaking fuel rods -- are not linked to Perry's operations, but to
manufacturing flaws.

<i><b>"Anger Is Main Reaction at Hearing on NU's Troubled Nuclear Power Plants"</b><br>
HARTFORD COURANT, 3/14/96, p. A21</i><br>
Barbara A. Nagy
<p>

Most of the 125 people who showed up for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's hearing Wednesday in New London, CT were "angry," reports
the HARTFORD COURANT.  The NRC is holding the hearings because of
alleged mismanagement at Northeast Utilities' three-unit Millstone
nuclear power plants.
<p>

Last year a Millstone engineer told the NRC that for the last 20 years
NU has not followed its operating license in refueling Unit 1. The
unit is now offline for a detailed analysis to make sure all systems
and procedures conform to the license.  On January 31, the NRC put
Millstone on its "watch list" until the agency sees "considerable
progress" -- something that usually takes two or three years.
<p>

Wayne Lanning, director of the NRC's Millstone oversight team, said he
intends to have public hearings every other month to bring people up
to date, listen to comments and answer questions.  But Hartford
resident Bob Rutter said, "This kind of company and this kind of fox
guarding the henhouse cannot be tolerated."
<p>

Nine-year-old David Walker told the NRC staffers he was afraid the
plant would shut down, putting his father out of work and wasting
millions of dollars.

<i><b>"Wisconsin Debates Plan for Nuclear Fuel Storage"</b><br>
JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, 3/14/96, p. 7B</i><br>
Lee Hawkins Jr.
<p>

The controversy over Wisconsin Electric Power Co.'s plan to build a
series of concrete-lined casks to encase spent nuclear fuel rods on
the shores of Lake Michigan "came to a head this week."  Local
residents and environmentalists testified before the Michigan Public
Service Commission about the potential dangers of storing the waste at
the site.
<p>

The Point Beach plan was drawn up after the Energy Dept. failed to
meet deadlines to build a national storage site and take possession of
the utility's spent fuel.  Wepco officials tried to reassure residents
that the site would only be used as a temporary storage option, while
the federal government completes its storage plans.
<p>

But Marvin Resinikoff of Radioactive Waste Associates warned
regulators to be concerned about the possibility that the govern- ment
may never uphold its promises to store the waste.  Resin- ikoff: "It
is clear that the DOE no longer intends to take spent fuel from
nuclear reactors any time before 2015, or possibly 2025.  It may never
take the spent fuel from Point Beach at all."

<i><b>"UC Scientists See Almost No Chance of Nuclear Waste Megablast"</b><br>
SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE, 3/13/96</i><br>
David Perlman
<p>

"There is virtually no chance" that nuclear waste stored at the
proposed Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada could ever "explode
catastrophically," according to a study released yesterday by
researchers from the University of California at Berkeley.  The study
was done in response to a report last year by two Los Alamos National
Laboratory physicists which claimed that plutonium and uranium
containers stored at the site could eventually corrode, allowing waste
to accumulate and explode.
<p>

A nine-member UC team last summer developed detailed models of the
proposed repository and calculated the likelihood that waste might
escape from storage canisters and migrate through the mountain to
create "explosive masses."  The researchers concluded that "by the
time you accumulate the necessary plutonium for an explosion -- about
250 kilograms -- most of it has decayed." The $125,000 study is being
submitted to Los Alamos officials, who financed it.  It has also been
prepared for publication in the scientific journal Nuclear Technology.

<i><b>"Expert Says Nuclear Plant Was Mismanaged"</b><br>
DALLAS MORNING NEWS, 3/10/96</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

Joe Williams Jr., a former nuclear plant operator and Navy admiral,
testified last Friday that he would have shut down the South Texas
Project nuclear plant in late 1992 because "years of mismanagement"
had left it unsafe.  Williams is the second witness called by the city
of Austin in its lawsuit against Houston Lighting &amp; Power, which
operates the plant.
<p>

Austin, which owns 160f the plant, is seeking more than $115 million
to recover money it paid for repairs and replacement power during a
14-month period in which the plant was shut down by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.  In earlier testimony, a "former member" of the
NRC said that although the plant had received "good" and "superior"
performance ratings, it suffered from "numerous" maintenance and
management problems that made it unsafe.  HL&amp;P denies the
allegations.

<i><b>"Senate Panel Approves Interim Site in Nevada for Nuclear Waste" </b><br>
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 3/14/96, p. B2</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee yesterday voted 12-6
to send approve legislation that would send 120,000 metric tons of
spent nuclear fuel to a temporary storage site in Nevada and to speed
the development of the Ward Valley storage site in California.
<p>

The bill is similar to one passed by the House Commerce Committee last
summer.  It would allow for interim storage of the waste at Yucca
Mountain, NV, the planned site of the nation's permanent repository
for spent nuclear fuel.  However, the bill does not affect preparation
of the permanent site.
<p>

The bill calls for the Energy Dept. to start accepting waste for
temporary storage at Yucca Mountain by November 30, 1999, "provided
that the site has been approved by then for permanent storage.  In
addition, the bill would allow California to start developing the Ward
Valley site "after certain tests are conducted."  The Clinton
administration "has been reluctant" to approve the transfer of the
Ward Valley land to the state.

<i><b>"Hanford Dump Studies Draw Fire -- States Draw Battle Lines"</b><br>
SEATTLE TIMES, 3/11/96, p. B1</i><br>
Danny Westneat
<p>

Oregon and Washington State officials have "not reacted well" to the
notion that the Dept. of Energy may bring plutonium or other
radioactive wastes across their states to the "sprawling," 560-square-
mile Hanford complex near the Tri-Cities.
<p>

Gov. Mike Lowry (D-WA) accused DOE of being not entirely "forthright"
with the public on plans to treat, store or dump wastes at Hanford,
which already has the most nuclear wastes in the U.S.  Michael
Grainey, speaking for Gov. John Kitzhaber (D-OR), said Oregon will not
stand for becoming the nation's "radioactive garbage dump."
<p>

Though DOE has identified Hanford as one of the top candidates for
treating and disposing of nuclear wastes from around the nation,
officials say no decisions have been made. DOE plans to have meetings
in Portland, Seattle and Richland in April to discuss the issue.

<i><b>"Permanent Closing Urged for Salem Nuclear Generators"</b><br>
PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 3/13/96, p. B3</i><br>
James O'Neill
<p>

Several "watchdog" groups yesterday "demanded" that the Public Service
Electric &amp; Gas Co. permanently shut down both its Salem 1 and
Salem 2 nuclear reactors because of cracks in their steam generator
tubes.  But PSE&amp;G said it did not intend to restart the either of
the reactors until they are proven safe. PSE&amp;G spokesman Neil
Brown accused the groups of employing "scare tactics" that are "not in
anyone's best interest."
<p>

The New Jersey Public Interest Research Group and the Washington-
based Nuclear Information and Resource Service said they are skeptical
about PSE&amp;G's ability to inspect and repair the units in a way
that will ensure no further cracks occur. But Victor Dricks of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that PSE&amp;G is expected to
submit a plan of action once it completes inspections of the two
units.  Dricks: "If we thought the plant was unsafe, we wouldn't let
it open."

<i><b>"Japan Restarts Advanced Water Reactor After Glitch"</b><br>
JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, 3/13/96, p. 4B</i><br>

<p>

Japan yesterday resumed testing the world's first advanced boiling-
water reactor after shutting it down last month due to a problem with
its power system.  The reactor is expected to start producing
electricity today.
<p>

The 13.5 million kilowatt reactor is an improved version of the
conventional light-water reactor that industrial officials claim is
safer.  It was shut down manually on February 23 after power trouble
caused a pump to stop.  No radioactivity was found around the reactor.
<p>

But those troubles nearly coincided with an accident at Japan's
prototype fast-breeder reactor Monju, which fueled public fears of
nuclear power accidents.  Despite both mishaps, the Japanese
government has reiterated that it will not change its plans to
increase the country's use of nuclear power from 30% to 42% by 2010.
Monju, however, remains shut down.
<p>

       monitors the temperature of sodium used to cool the reactor.
       Officials say more tests need to be done to determine if other
       gauges at the reactor could suffer similar cracks.

<i><b>"Safety Deadline Set by Nuclear Agency for 2 Power Plants"</b><br>
NEW YORK TIMES, 3/9/96, p. A1</i><br>
Matthew Wald
<p>

"The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has given New England's largest
utility 30 days" to demonstrate that emergency safety systems at two
of its nuclear power plants in Connecticut comply with NRC rules, the
NEW YORK TIMES reports.
<p>

Northeast Utilities is "already under fire" for violating rules for
handling spent fuel rods at its Millstone 1 reactor near Waterford, CT
and now the NRC says it is concerned about several equipment problems
at Millstone 2 and 3 and the Connecticut Yankee plant in Haddam Neck.
The NRC ordered Millstone 2 to remain closed for now and said it was
sending about 20 inspectors to investigate the two plants' operations.
<p>

The agency's order is "a stinging rebuke" to Northeast Utilities and
"an embarrassment" to the NRC itself, which last month was the subject
of a TIME cover story about the commission's failure to enforce its
regulations.
<p>

<center><i>NOT UNUSUAL?</i></center>
<p>

Ted Feigenbaum, the utility's chief nuclear officer, "said none of the
problems was serious but ... collectively they undermined the
commission's confidence in plant safety." Feigenbaum said finding
minor problems was "not unexpected under the circumstances, when
you're starting to turn over rocks."
<p>

But Paul Blanch, a former NU engineer who claims he was "hounded out
of his job" for raising safety issues, said a close review "would find
much more," the TIMES reports.
<p>

Millstone 1 has been shut for weeks at a cost of $5-6 million a month,
mostly for replacement power.  At Millstone 2, the cost is $8-10
million, the TIMES reports.

       to the public from the reactors.  The article reports that one
       of the industry's "most fervent champions of safety," S. David

<i><b>"Appraisal Company Had Never Assessed a Nuclear Plant"</b><br>
HARTFORD COURANT, 3/7/96, p. B3</i><br>
Rosalinda DeJesus
<p>

A 1992 appraisal of the Connecticut Yankee nuclear power plant and the
credentials of the engineering firm that did the appraisal are "hot
issues" in a court case nearing its conclusion in the Middletown
Superior Court.
<p>

Pennsylvania-based Dean and Associates assessed the plant's fair
market value in 1992 at $840 million, "triggering" a lawsuit by owner
Northeast Utilities, which claimed the value was closer to $230
million. Then, in testimony two months ago in the "high- profile"
case, the engineering firm's owner, Steve Dean, "acknowledged
miscalculating" the 1992 appraisal and revised the figure to $485.7
million.  That had an "immediate impact" on the town of Haddam, which
now may have to raise property taxes to make up for the loss of
revenue from Connecticut Yankee.
<p>

<center><i>NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE?</i></center>
<p>

Former Selectman Michael Bromley said in an interview last week that
the accounting firm Arthur Andersen had recommended Dean and
Associates -- and the contract was awarded without competition -- even
though the firm had never assessed a nuclear plant.  Steve Dean is a
former engineer with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and
Westinghouse. Bromley: We did not pick these people out of a hat."
<p>

The two sides in the case are scheduled to present closing arguments
today (Monday).

<i><b>"N-Plant Lands HL&amp;P, Austin in Court"</b><br>
HOUSTON CHRONICLE, 3/7/96, p. 23A</i><br>
George Flynn
<p>

In the opening of a trial in state District Court, attorneys for
Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co. and the city of Austin, TX last week
presented "opposite images" of the management of the Bay City nuclear
power plant.  Austin, a co-owner of the plant, is suing HL&amp;P for
$125 million in costs resulting from a 1993 shutdown of the plant.
<p>

Randy Wilson, an attorney for the city, said the plant's failure
"stemmed from HL&amp;P's rush to cut costs" too quickly. Wilson quoted
an HL&amp;P plant manager who said, "We tried to get 'cheap' before we
got good."  And he said HL&amp;P continued to postpone maintenance and
"slash training programs" in the face of "mounting outside criticism."
<p>

HL&amp;P attorney David Beck "accused Austin of indulging in
revisionist history and selective memory" about what really went on at
the plant.  He said Austin, as co-owner, sat on the management board
and "was aware of exactly what was going on."

ask New Jersey-based Public Service Electric &amp; Gas to permanently
close its Salem Nuclear Generating Station.  Equip- ment and

reactors' steam generators (PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 3/9/96, p. D3,

<i><b>"Vanishing Act"</b><br>
ELECTRIC PERSPECTIVES, 3-4/96 issue, p. 4</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

A recent survey by the Washington International Energy Group (WEIG)
and Canadian Electrical Association reveals that most power industry
executives believe they will experience "massive consolidation,"
achieve universal retail access, and get more involved on the "other
side of the meter."
<p>

The "1996 Electric Industry Outlook" survey polled 3,557 senior
executives from electric utilities and independent power producers in
the US and Canada.  The survey found that only 42% believe their
company will be intact in ten years.  Forty-eight percent believe
their company will acquire or be acquired by another company, and 62%
think hostile takeovers will increase. Fifty-five percent said they
were currently involved in merger/acquisition discussions.
<p>

Executives were divided over the future of nuclear power. About 39%
said nuclear power can be competitive, while an equal percentage said
it cannot.  Only about 8% think there will be a resurgence of nuclear
power.

<i><b>"Le Bon Coal"</b><br>
RURAL ELECTRIFICATION, 3/6/96, p. 14</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

Southern France will soon boast "the world's largest clean coal power
plant."  State-owned Electricite de France commissioned the 250-
megawatt plant, which features a circulating-fluidized-bed boiler.
The power plant will be built by a consortium that includes ENDESA,
the Spanish power group.
<p>

"The project is a new step for the French utility," which currently
gets 800f its power from nuclear reactors.  If the plant is
successful, EDF hopes to use the technology in other countries, says
spokeswoman Sarah Berkey.

... Peco agreed it will not charge its customers for what it has spent

<i><b>"Understanding Peco's Response"</b><br>
PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 3/8/96, p. C1</i><br>
B.J. Phillips, Column
<p>

Columnist B.J. Phillips notes a letter to the editor from Peco Energy
Co. CEO Joseph Paquette that was published in the PHILADELPHIA
INQUIRER and this space on Wednesday, in which Paquette said
"reforming the electricity industry ... would be a costly mistake. ...
I love his letter because it's a case study of how a special interest
protects its turf," Phillips writes.
<p>

Phillips dismisses Paquette's claims that the state would lose tax
revenues and that high electric rates in Pennsylvania do not hurt
industry because Peco's rates are competitive with those elsewhere in
the Northeast.  Phillips: "The Northeast, a.k.a. the Rust Belt, isn't
taking our jobs; the Southeast and Southwest are.  One hallmark of
these fast-growing states: cheap electricity."
<p>

But Paquette's greatest worry is recovering the cost of "those two
nuclear albatrosses" from ratepayers, so that investors do not have to
take the entire hit.  "Spoken like a man who knows he has captive
customers but not captive shareholders," Phillips notes, concluding,
"Deregulate 'em.  Now."

<i><b>"Next Stop for O'Leary: Capitol Hill"</b><br>
WASHINGTON POST, 3/8/96, p. A1</i><br>
Sharon Walsh
<p>

As the House Commerce Committee resumes hearings today on Energy
Secretary Hazel O'Leary's "lavish spending on official travel," her
critics "intend to broaden their attacks" and argue that O'Leary's
"disregard for spending has hurt department employees and programs."
<p>

"Resentment" among DOE employees "is building" after notices recently
went out telling them to expect more unpaid furloughs and no more
performance bonuses as part of the broader effort to avoid
layoffs. "With O'Leary now planning her next international trip to an
energy conference in Vienna, some employees grumble that the secretary
should find a way to take the budget hit herself."
<p>

The lengthy, detailed WASHINGTON POST article notes that "travel
extravagance" has been a "Washington trap" for many previous
officials. O'Leary and her supporters say the attacks are motivated by
partisan politics and disagreements over policy. But O'Leary "has been
criticized for not heeding an inspector general's recommendation that
she take no expensive foreign trips" until she has made accounting
changes in managing the DOE travel budget.

... The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has scheduled an "informal 
public hearing" today to assess allegations that Northeast Utilities 
has violated the operating licenses of its nuclear power plants in 
Connecticut and New Hampshire. Whistleblower George Galatis says plant 
engineers have routinely overloaded waste-storage pools.  Another 
meeting this Friday will focus on cracks found in the steam generator

<i><b>"Tribe:  'No Deal' on Nuclear Storage"</b><br>
MINNEAPOLIS STAR-TRIBUNE, 3/6/96, p. B1</i><br>
Tom Meersman
<p>

Dealings between Northern States Power Co. and the Prairie Island
Dakota Tribe "dissolved into confusion and disagreement" on Tuesday
just hours after both parties said they had reached an agreement on
nuclear waste storage.  The tribe "surprised nearly everyone" by
announcing "there is no deal" until it receives land and compensation
in exchange for supporting changes in a 1994 state waste-storage law.
<p>

On Monday, NSP President and CEO Jim Howard and Tribal Chairman Curtis
Campbell met and issued a letter indicating they had agreed on a
"limited proposal" in which NSP would give the tribe $2 million in
cash and additional annual payments.  NSP would also win relief from a
provision requiring it to search for an alternative waste-storage site
in Goodhue County.  The utility currently stores waste in on-site
casks.
<p>

But the Howard-Campbell letter "omitted any mention of land," and the
tribe "apparently had a change of heart Tuesday." Tribal leaders
"acknowledged" the confusion they were creating but said the only
agreement so far is "an agreement in principle to continue working
together" on the legislation.
<p>

"The issue of land has bothered" Gov. Arne Carlson (R) and some
legislators who say the tribe may use the land to build another
casino.  The tribe says its main motive is to relocate residents who
no longer want to live adjacent to NSP's Red Wing nuclear power plant
and its on- site waste-disposal facility. Some observers questioned
whether there is enough time to enact any changes in the current
legislative session.

       asserts the latest version of the legislation was "not all it

       editorial suggests the tribe use the cash it would receive to
       buy additional land.  Passage of the bill would bring numerous
       benefits and "offer Minnesotans a respite from toxic nuclear
       wrangling."

LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL, 3/1/96, p. 3B</i><br>
Tony Batt
<p>

Caliente, NV, Mayor Kevin Phillips asked the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on February 29 to restore oversight funding for Nevada
counties that want to review the government's nuclear waste studies at
Yucca Mountain.  Congress cut funding for the counties in the 1996
budget when "some lawmakers complained Nevada had used federal money
to oppose studies of Yucca Mountain as a permanent nuclear waste
repository." Phillips told the committee "...you've stopped the only
credible scientific oversight studies going on."
<p>

Also at the hearing were Sens. Richard Bryan (D-NV) and Harry Reid
(D-NV), who sought to fight any funding for temporary nuclear waste
storage in Nevada.  Congress is waiting to vote on a bill by Rep. Fred
Upton (R-MI) which would allow temporary nuclear waste storage in
Nevada, but the committee could still retain Nevada for interim
nuclear waste storage in this year's budget.  Reid: "Basically, we
were there to alert the committee not to try anything cute because
we'll be waiting for you."

<i><b>"Austin, San Antonio Set for Legal Fight over Nuclear Plant" </b><br>
HOUSTON BUSINESS JOURNAL, 3/1/96</i><br>
Ann de Rouffignac
<p>

The city-owned utilities of Austin and San Antonio will face Houston
Light &amp; Power Co. in court this week over "costs and mismanagement" at
the South Texas Project nuclear power plant. The dispute is over who
should pay for replacement fuel and power during the plant's yearlong
outage that began in 1993.
<p>

Austin owns a 16hare of the plant, and San Antonio has a 28take.
Central Power &amp; Light of Corpus Christi owns 25.2%, but is not
taking part in the lawsuit.  HL&amp;P owns a 30.8hare and is the
plant's operator and manager.
<p>

Austin says HL&amp;P owes it "about $125 million," while San Antonio
is claiming "about $200 million."  Besides the claims for replacement
fuel and power costs, San Antonio says it shouldn't have to pay for
"certain operation and maintenance expenses that were incurred because
of poor management."
<p>

Between 1983 and 1989, Austin and HL&amp;P fought a "costly battle"
over construction cost overruns at the South Texas Project -- a case
that Austin ultimately lost.  But John Gooding, Austin's in-house
counsel, says, "We have a negligence cause of action instead of a
limited breach of contract case.  We think we'll present a strong case
that HL&amp;P didn't manage the nuclear plant to an accepted
standard."
<p>

HL&amp;P spokesman Graham Painter: "We don't believe they have a
case.... HL&amp;P has not indemnified other owners against unforeseen
things that have happened at the plant."

<i><b>"Radioactive Release Contaminates 16 Maine Yankee Workers" </b><br>
BOSTON GLOBE ONLINE, 3/4/96</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

Sixteen workers at the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant were
"contaminated with low levels of radiation during a routine
maintenance project," the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.
<p>

An initial review by the NRC found the radiation release was "well
below regulatory limits," but it was still an "unusual situation,"
said NRC spokesman Victor Dricks.  The mechanics were trying to
install a cap on a tank when some radioactive gas was released.
<p>

Maine Yankee VP Graham Leitch said his company was "undertaking an
extensive review of why this occurred and what steps are necessary to
ensure it does not occur again."  The incident came just weeks after
Maine Yankee returned to service after extensive repairs to its steam
generator tubes.

<i><b>"Scientists Look into Nuclear-Waste Sorter" </b><br>
SALT LAKE TRIBUNE, 3/2/96, p. A3</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

Scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory are developing a
device that could be used to separate low-level waste from
uncontaminated waste.  Called a WAND -- Waste Acceptance for
Nonradioactive Disposal -- the detector screens "routine, low-density
trash" to see whether some of it could be disposed of at a
nonradioactive landfill.
<p>

The lab buries more than 85,000 cubic feet of low-level waste at its
Area G landfill each year, with disposal costs running about a $100 a
cubic feet and rising.  With WAND, the lab might be able to remove
much of the nonradioactive waste, "especially the 200r so that is
paper, cardboard or plastic," and dispose of it at a "normal landfill"
at about 25 cents a cubic foot.
<p>

The lab said WAND "still must prove its effectiveness in tests before
it can be put into use."

<i><b>"Nuclear Sale"</b><br>
FINANCIAL TIMES, 3/4/96, p. 17</i><br>
Editorial
<p>

Negotiations over privatizing the UK's nuclear industry have "turned
into a standoff," according to the FINANCIAL TIMES.  The conflict
between the British government and British Energy -- the company
created for the sale -- centers on two issues: liabilities and debts.
<p>

The government "appears to have won" the first point, insisting that
all liabilities associated with running British Energy's eight power
stations should also be transferred to the new company.  But the issue
of debt levels remains "fiercely contested."
<p>

The FINANCIAL TIMES:  "Mr. Ian Lang, industry secretary, should 
continue to play tough on this point.  The government has been rightly 
criticized for privatizing many utilities with unnecessarily well- 
capitalized balance sheets, in order to smooth the sale.  Instead, 
initial debt should be set as high as expectations of cash flow will 
permit."

<i><b>"Deal Apparently Reached in NSP Suit Over Nuclear Plant
Equipment"</b><br>
MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE, 3/1/96, p. B1</i><br>
Tom Meersman
<p>

Northern States Power Co. and Westinghouse Electric Corp. have
"apparently achieved a breakthrough" in a multi-million- dollar
lawsuit over the Prairie Island nuclear plant just days before the
dispute was scheduled to go to trial.
<p>

Both parties declined to discuss details, and it is unclear whether
all of them have been worked out.  But the trial, which was scheduled
for court today (3/4), has been removed from the trial calendar.
<p>

NSP filed the suit in July 1993 on grounds that the equipment built
and installed by Westinghouse in the early 1970s was already wearing
out before its guaranteed 40-year lifespan.

<i><b>"Millstone Oversight an Embarrassment, Official Says"</b><br>
HARTFORD COURANT, 3/1/96, p. A6</i><br>
Barbara Nagy
<p>

A top Nuclear Regulatory Commission official said he is embarrassed
the NRC took 20 years to realize the Millstone 1 nuclear power plant
was being refueled improperly, and he acknowledged the agency has lost
public trust.
<p>

Speaking at a news conference on February 29, Thomas Martin, NRC's
Northeast regional administrator, said there is "no excuse" for the
oversight and the agency is investigating how the irregularities went
undetected.  The refueling practices at the plant owned by Northeast
Utilities became public last year after a series of problems.
<p>

Unit 1 has been off-line since November for detailed review of the
plant's systems and is not expected to operate again until mid-summer
at the earliest, Martin said.

<i><b>"Nuclear Plant's Value Melts Down"</b><br>
HARTFORD COURANT, 3/1/96, p. B1</i><br>
Rosalinda DeJesus
<p>

"Acknowledging a major miscalculation" in its assessment of the
Connecticut Yankee nuclear power plant, the town of Haddam has
released figures indicating its new assessment is about $840 million,
"millions below" the previous number.  The town's "grand list" of all
taxable property dropped by more than $280 million, the HARTFORD
COURANT reports.  "The change will almost certainly cause a rise in
local property taxes next year."
<p>

Northeast Utilities, the principal owner of Connecticut Yankee, sued
the town in 1992, saying its assessment of the plant was too
high. Northeast "insists" the value is about $230 million.  "People
affiliated with both sides" of the suit say "a settlement may be
drawing near." Closing arguments in the trial begin March 11 in
Middletown Superior Court.

<i><b>"Shut Nuclear Plant to Resume Operation"</b><br>
PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 3/2/96, p. B1</i><br>
Douglas Campbell
<p>

A team of eight federal inspectors on March 1 said New Jersey's Hope
Creek nuclear power plant is almost ready to resume generating
electricity.  The plant has been shut down since November when, during
a scheduled refueling, operators inadvertently reduced the flow of
cooling water to the reactor.
<p>

In a public meeting, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told the
plant's owner, Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co., that the utility
must report on three items before it can restart.  Citing declining
performance, the NRC decided to conduct an inspection of the Hope
Creek plant.

<i><b>"Volunteers Sought for Waste Site"</b><br>
PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 3/3/96</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

The Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Protection on March 1 issued a
plan to encourage communities across the state to consider hosting a
low-level radioactive waste storage site.
<p>

The plan, formulated by the DEP and contractor Chem-Nuclear Systems
Inc., offers municipalities information on what is involved in
becoming the site, and "provides a way for community leaders to
express interest in the project."  Pennsylvania agreed in 1985 to
build and operate a site to store waste generated there and in
Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia.
<p>

Officials hope to have the site open in about seven years. A five-
year technical evaluation of the state to find safe and suitable
locations was halted in July, when the DEP narrowed the focus of the
search to finding a volunteer.

<i><b>"SCC Staff Report Criticizes Federal Waste-Fund Effort"</b><br>
VIRGINIAN-PILOT, 2/29/96, p. D1</i><br>
Dave Mayfield
<p>

"The federal government's expensive and time-consuming search" for a
place to store spent fuel from nuclear power plants "poses an
'economic threat to Virginia,'" according to a state Corporation
Commission staff report.
<p>

But the report stopped short of urging the commissioners to allow
Virginia utilities to discontinue collecting fees from their customers
to help pay for the waste-fund effort.
<p>

After spending $4.5 billion searching for a nuclear waste disposal
site, the DOE says it cannot open a site until 2010 -- 12 years later
than required by federal law.  Virginia ratepayers have paid $361
million toward the DOE waste fund and may have to pay another $400
million.  The SCC staff recommended against any action on the matter
until a multi-state lawsuit against DOE is resolved.

<i><b>  "O'Leary Backs Yucca Mtn."</b><br>
LAS VEGAS SUN, 3/1/96, p. 5A</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

"Saying there is an urgent need to dispose of tons of
surplus plutonium and uranium," Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary on 
Wednesday reiterated support for a high-level nuclear waste 
repository at Yucca Mtn., NV.  Lacking a permanent disposal facility 
and facing perennial delays at the Yucca Mtn. site, many electric 
utilities have had to store such wastes at their own facilities.
<p>
     
The issue came up as O'Leary laid out a "draft programmatic 
environmental impact statement" outlining ways to manage the federal 
government's nuclear weapons stockpiles.  The Energy Dept. has 
postponed a decision on how to dispose of surplus plutonium and 
bomb-grade uranium from dismantled weapons.  But it said it has 
narrowed its options to three:
<ul>
  <li>  Use the material to power nuclear reactors;
  <li> "Immobilize" it in glass or ceramics, possibly along with other
       high-level wastes;
  <li> Bury it deep underground.
</ul>
A decision on the surplus nuclear materials is expected in June.<p>

<i><b>"Maine Yankee Probes Said Costly But Vital; Nuclear Plant
Official Defends Multiple Investigations"</b><br>
BANGOR DAILY NEWS, 2/24/96 </i><br>
Bruce Kyle
<p>

Maine Yankee President Charles D. Frizzle told the Rockland, ME,
Rotary Club Friday that multiple investigations into an anonymous
allegation that Maine Yankee safety records are "enormously time-
consuming and expensive," but also "absolutely essential."
<p>

An anonymous letter sent to the Union of Concerned Scientists in
December charged that Maine Yankee has used a "flawed" computer code
to monitor its safety systems since 1984 and has "knowingly concealed"
its knowledge of the flaw from federal regulators.
<p>

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is investigating the charge, with
its work monitored by the agency's Inspector General.  Maine Yankee
has conducted its own inquiry and hired a Pennsylvania law firm to
conduct an independent investigation.  Only Maine Yankee's internal
investigation is complete, finding no evidence of a flaw or
coverup. But Frizzle said he realizes federal officials will have the
"final word."
<p>

The plant shut down "early last year" for steam-generator repairs and
was supposed to go back on line in December.  The letter delayed
startup until January, when the NRC said the plant could run at 900f
full power until the investigation was complete.  Frizzle said the
month's delay cost Maine Yankee customers nearly $5 million for
purchased power, and the legal expenses so far stand at $900,000.

<i><b>"Nuclear Middlemen"</b><br>
NEW YORK TIMES, 2/28/96, p. A17</i><br>
Kenneth Timmerman, Op-Ed
<p>

The US Senate "is scheduled to hold hearings today on a dangerous new
treaty negotiated by the Clinton administration that would lift
longstanding controls on nuclear trade," writes Kenneth Timmerman,
director of the Middle East Data Project, a research group that tracks
nuclear proliferation.
<p>

The treaty grants the 15 members of Euratom, the European Union's
atomic energy agency, "the right to sell without our approval"
plutonium that they have extracted from spent US nuclear fuel, writes
Timmerman. Last November, President Clinton told Congress that the
treaty would help "insure a continuation and, I hope, growth of U.S.
civil nuclear exports to Euratom member states."
<p>

"The administration, it seems, is pushing exports with one hand while
trying to restrain nuclear proliferation with the other."  The treaty
"imposes trade controls on rogue states like Iran, but trusts our
allies to judge which nations will use nuclear materials only for
peaceful purposes."  Several European nations, including Germany,
France, Belgium, Italy and Austria "regularly do business with
would-be nuclear powers like Iran and Iraq," Timmerman concludes.

Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary indicated yesterday she would like to
stay on in her post if President Clinton is reelected. O'Leary,
speaking to a reporter after addressing a state energy officials
group, said efforts in Congress to cut the DOE's budget and

push for more sustainable energy programs and fight the proliferation
of weapons-grade nuclear material.

Associated Press
<p>

Six former employees who have "blown the whistle on safety problems"
at the Millstone nuclear plant in Waterford, CT, are refusing to take
part in a federal investigation into their claims of harassment. Their
attorney, Ernest C. Hadley, said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
"mishandling the investigation" by revealing the workers' names to
Northeast Utilities.
<p>

Some of the workers have legal action against NU, and, said Hadley,
disclosing their names "could hurt their cases."  Giving their names
to the utility also makes it easier for NU to prepare responses to
allegations that "may surface" during the NRC review.  NRC spokeswoman
Diane Screni said that for the NRC to get both sides, the names had to
be disclosed to NU.  Hadley suggested turning the investigation over
to the NRC's inspector general, an independent arm of the agency.

problems with three of its eight intermediate cooling pumps, "the 
latest in a series of glitches that have plagued the facility." But 
the problems have posed no safety concerns, according to an official 
with Hong Kong-based China Light & Power (WALL STREET JOURNAL, 
2/23/96, p. A7A, Erik Guyot).

<i><b>"Maine Yankee Will Rerack Its Spent-Fuel Assemblies Later
This year"</b><br>
BANGOR DAILY NEWS, 2/17/96</i><br>
Brian Swartz
<p>

With a federal repository for high-level radioactive waste not due to
open until 2010, engineers have begun a program to rerack the spent
fuel stored at the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant.  The project will
involve installing new racks in the 40- cubic-foot pool where the
spent fuel is now stored and trans- ferring the fuel, under water,
from the old racks to the new.
<p>

Maine Yankee's reactor core contains 217 fuel assemblies, each with
176 rods filled with uranium dioxide pellets.  The plant refuels every
18 months, when it replaces about a third of the used fuel assemblies.
The plant has been operating since 1972.  Reracking the plant's
spent-fuel pool will give Maine Yankee enough space to store spent
fuel until 2008.
<p>

The Department of Energy was supposed to open a repository in 1998,
says Maine Yankee's Bob Jordan.  DOE "examined various underground
repository sites before deciding to build one at Yucca Mountain in
Nevada."  About six years ago, Maine Yankee realized the "seriousness
of the delay" and decided to rerack its pool.  Reracking will be done
on an "accelerated schedule," 10 hours a day, six days a week,
beginning this spring.

       Pennsylvania "right through" St.  Louis and "fortunately

FINANCIAL TIMES, 2/22/96, p. 7</i><br>
David Lascelles, James Blitz and Richard Tomkins
<p>

Britain's nuclear privatization "was thrown into confusion" yesterday
when British Energy Minister Tim Eggar confirmed that he was
considering a "purchase approach" by the US utility Duke Power,
although Duke Power executives "flatly denied any interest."
<p>

Eggar said that a preliminary offer from Duke was being considered in
an effort to obtain the best value possible for the taxpayer.  But
Guynn Savage of North Carolina-based Duke Power "emphatically and
vehemently" denied that the utility has expressed any interest in
purchasing the UK nuclear units.
<p>

The confusion was traced to informal contracts between merchant
bankers working for the two parties.  The developments "cast the
sell-off in a new light by showing that the government is willing to
consider a private sale instead of the planned flotation."

<i><b>"Utilities to Spend $1.4 Billion on Power Plant Maintenance"</b><br>
ELECTRIC LIGHT &amp; POWER, 2/96 issue, p. 17</i><br>
Teresa Hansen
<p>

North American electric utilities have scheduled 795 power plant
maintenance projects valued at over $1.4 billion for the period
running from last October and ending April 1, 1998.
<p>

Approximately 300f the fossil-fuel plants in North America have
scheduled outages, while 870f all nuclear plants will shut down for
maintenance work.
<p>

Outages are conducted for reasons ranging from operations optimization
to government or insurance requirements, as well as for preventative
maintenance.  Based on interviews with utility contacts, conducted by
CSR Market Data Services, most voluntary outages are done to repair
components in the plant's turbine, generator or boiler/burner.

<i><b>"Commission Could Shut Down Part of Wisconsin Nuclear Power Plant"</b><br>
Minneapolis STAR TRIBUNE, 2/17/96, p. B1</i><br>
Tom Meersman
<p>

Wisconsin Electric Power Co.'s Point Beach nuclear power plant may be
forced into a partial shutdown this fall because of concerns over on-
site storage of radioactive waste and the condition of the plant's
aging steam generators.
<p>

Inspections last year showed that hundreds of tubes that carry hot,
radioactive water under high pressure are corroding faster than
officials had expected.  Cracks and other deterioration forced WEPCO
to obtain a special license amendment this year to continue operating
one of its steam generators.  And regulators who last February gave
WEPCO permission to store radioactive waste at Point Beach have been
required by a federal judge to reconsider.  Environmentalists had
appealed the approval of on-site storage.

<p>

<b><i>DECISION WILL HAVE RIPPLE EFFECT</i></b>
<p>

In April, Wisconsin's Public Service Commission will decide the future
of the Point Beach plant, and the decision may play into merger plans
between Northern States Power Co. and WEPCO. The two utilities plan to
merge at the end of this year and the future of the Point Beach plant
could have "financial repercussions."
<p>

But uncertainty about Point Beach's future does not threaten the
merger, according to Robert Link, WEPCO's VP of nuclear operations.
NPS officials declined to speculate on the matter.

<i><b>"Big Nuclear Agency Discussed"</b><br>
TORONTO GLOBE &amp; MAIL, 2/19/96, p. B1</i><br>
Martin Mittelstaedt
<p>

Ontario Hydro and the Canadian nuclear energy company Atomic Energy of
Canada Ltd. have had "a series of high-level meetings" to discuss
merging into a single company called Nuclear Canada.
<p>

The new company would be an unusual hybrid with joint federal and
Ontario ownership.  "With its huge size and more than $30 billion in
assets, it would become one of the most important corporations in the
world involved in producing and marketing nuclear energy."
<p>

While those involved stress that the talks have been only preliminary,
senior AECL officials have urged the Ontario government to consider
the possibility of a merger in weighing the future of Ontario Hydro.

<i><b>"Utility Deregulation Could Worsen Air Quality in East,Coalition Says" </b><br>
WASHINGTON POST, 2/21/96, p. A4</i><br>
Gary Lee
<p>

The impending deregulation of utilities is likely to worsen air
pollution along the East Coast, according to a coalition of
environmental groups and state officials.  The Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission this summer will issue its final rule allowing
power producers wider access to markets nationwide.
<p>

In all, deregulation could increase emissions of nitrogen oxide in the
Midwest by as much as 400,000 tons per year, according to an analysis
by the DC-based Center for Clean Air Policy.  It also predicted
increases in carbon-dioxide emissions and toxic pollutants such as
mercury.  Because of prevailing winds, the Northeast would receive the
brunt of the added pollution, the study said.
<p>

Under FERC's proposed rule, coal-fired power plants in the Midwest
that produce electricity at cheaper rates than their nuclear or oil-
burning competitors could boost output to sell power in regions where
rates are higher.  But by burning more coal, the plants would also
increase their emissions of nitrogen oxides, fine particulates and
other air pollutants, warned the CCAP's Executive Director Ned Helme:
"The increased production would inevitably bring more pollution."
<p>

<b><i>AEP:  A CASE IN POINT</i></b>
<p>

The center recently analyzed how deregulation would affect energy
production at American Electric Power, a major Midwest utility that
generates 830f its power from coal.  American Electric's plants
currently run at 70apacity.  The center predicts that if it raised
its capacity just 10%, the utility would emits tens of thousands more
tons of nitrogen oxides, a key contributor to urban smog.
<p>

<b><i>GROUPS OFFER MORE THAN JUST CRITICISM</i></b>
<p>

A coalition of environmental groups, Northeastern utilities and
consumer advocacy groups, such as Public Citizen and the Izaak Walton
League of America, is pushing FERC to add environmental restrictions
to the proposed rule.  They have offered a number of suggestions,
including requiring coal-burning plants to install more antipollution
technology or allowing utilities to offset increased emissions at some
plants with reductions from other plants in the region.
<p>

But a coalition of Midwestern utilities and other business groups
argue against changing the proposed rule on the grounds that
environmental problems should be handled by the US Environmental
Protection Agency, not FERC.

<i><b>"Ukraine's Energy Crisis Eases" </b><br>
FINANCIAL TIMES, 2/20/96, p. 2</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

Warmer temperatures and the resumption of coal shipments have eased
Ukraine's energy crisis slightly, although about 5,000 factories
remain closed and officials are still considering rationing each
region to just a few hours of electricity a day.
<p>

The crisis began last week when Russia took Ukraine off their shared
power grid.  Russians officials were afraid the grid might be damaged
by additional power demands from Ukraine, brought on by a coal strike
and record cold temperatures.  Miners went back to work last Friday,
allowing for coal shipments to resume.  Slightly warmer temperatures
are also helping.

<i><b>EC INVESTIGATION OF NUKE PRIVATIZATION</b></i><br>

The European Commission's competition directorate last month sent a
letter to the UK Dept. of Trade and Industry seeking assurances that
the UK is not trying to use state aid to illegally "sweeten" pending
nuclear power privatization deals.
<p>

Several enviro and anti-nuclear groups charge that state- owned
Nuclear Electric is accelerating its payments on nuclear waste cleanup
bills to reduce the plants' enviro liabilities by $975 billion before
they are privatized.  DTI confirmed that it was talking with the EC,
but insisted they did not plan to use state aid in the sale.  One DTI
"official said the ministers were determined to transfer all relevant
cleanup costs to the private sector."

<i><b>"Maine Yankee Returning to Service"</b><br>
BOSTON GLOBE, 2/15/96</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

The Maine Yankee nuclear power plant began returning to service
Wednesday after a brief shutdown because of a problem in one of its
three steam generators.  Spokesman Marshall Murphy said the plant will
be reconnected to the regional power grid "in the next day or so."
<p>

Maine Yankee shut down automatically at about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, when
high water levels were detected in the steam generator.  On Wednesday
afternoon, technicians replaced the control devices that caused the
problem.
<p>

The plant was brought back on line "just last month," after being
closed for a year to repair cracks in its steam generators. The $27
million repairs required inserting metal sleeves into each of the
plant's 17,000 steam generator tubes.
<p>

Murphy said the Tuesday shutdown had nothing to do with the earlier
repairs.  But Bill Linnell of the Committee for a Safe Energy Future
said, "This is more evidence that Maine Yankee, which is the eighth
oldest pressurized water reactor in the country, is experiencing more
aging problems."

<i><b>"Botched Nuclear Report a Study in Waste"</b><br>
USA TODAY, 2/16/96, p. 10A</i><br>
Editorial
<p>

"Imagine a pillar more than two miles thick, as high as Mount Everest
and glowing like a bug-zapper.  That's how much contaminated waste is
now lying around in the nation's vast nuclear weapons complex," writes
the editorial board at USA TODAY.  "Now imagine a column of dollar
bill 3.5 miles high, weighing 60 tons, and surrounded by a neon ribbon
flashing 'burn me ... burn me.'"  That stack would be the $59 million
the Energy Dept. spent to study how to dispose of its nuclear waste.
<p>

While the study was supposed to cost a fraction of that and be
completed in three years, it remains unfinished and is drawing
criticism from all quarters as useless.  But despite all its problems,
the "ill- starred study may have value after all.  It's a sobering
reminder of the scope of the cleanup task and of the perils of
underestimating it."

<i><b>"Storage of Nuclear Waste 'Unsatisfactory'"</b><br>
LONDON INDEPENDENT, 2/15/96</i><br>
Nicholas Schoon
<p>

Government regulators have strongly criticized some of British Nuclear
Fuel's methods for storing and disposing of nuclear waste at its
Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site and the nearby Drigg low-level
waste storage site.
<p>

A new study from the Nuclear Inspections Inspectorate and Her
Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution released on Wednesday found "a
number of storage facilities to be less than satisfactory."  The
report made 15 specific recommendations, such as improving
recordkeeping of intermediate-level wastes, but said none of the
materials posed an immediate risk to the public. "The most damaging
part of the report consists of several photographs with captions
showing drums of plutonium contaminated waste stacked too high or in
an unstable position, or so exposed to the elements that they were
rusting."

Florida Power Corp. will shut down its Crystal River plant this month

<p>


"A desolate, 1,000-acre tract of federal land in the Mojave Desert has
become Ground Zero for an explosive political battle over how to
dispose of the millions of cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste
that the United States produces each year," reports the WASHINGTON
POST.
<p>

The Ward Valley dump would be the first state-run repository under the
federal 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. That law made
regional state "compacts" responsible only for disposing of low-level
radioactive waste produced by industries and medical and research
institutions.
<p>

Although the struggle over Ward Valley has focused on such
environmental issues as water quality and endangered species habitat,
"the real conflict" boils down to whether low-level nuclear waste can
safely be stored in unlined underground trenches.  The argument has
taken on "added significance" due to the federal budget reconciliation
bill presently stalled in Congress.  It remains gridlocked partly over
an amendment sought by nuclear industry lobbyists that would transfer
ownership of the federally owned Ward Valley land to California,
allowing the repository's construction to go forward.

MINNEAPOLIS STAR-TRIBUNE, 2/9/96, p. B1</i><br>
Tom Meersman
<p>

A bill to allow increased nuclear waste storage at Minnesota's Prairie
Island nuclear power plant and to require Northern States Power Co. to
compensate a neighboring Indian tribe "passed its first test" on
Tuesday, as the Senate Jobs Committee approved it, 7-6.  The measure
would allow NSP to pack more spent fuel rods into storage pools at the
plant, a process called reracking, and end the search for an
alternative site for above-ground, waste-storage casks.  During debate
on the measure, Senate Democrats questioned the utility's credibility,
recalling that when NSP sought approval for the above-ground casks in
1994, it claimed reracking was "too risky for plant employees."
<p>

State Sen. Ellen Anderson (D): "Why are you telling us now that you
have to have authority to extend this plant and produce nuclear wastes
for 10 or 15 more years ... when you promised to us two years ago that
that would not happen?"  NSP officials said reracking was not an
option in 1994 because new racks could not have been installed without
shutting down the plant.  With storage now available in the casks,
enough room can be made in the pool for new racks, they said.

<i><b>INDIANS, ENVIROS UNHAPPY</b></i>
<p>

Curtis Campbell, president of the Mdewankanton Dakota Tribe Council,
urged legislators to support a provision requiring NSP to give the
tribe money and land over the next two decades as compensation for
having to live next to the waste storage site. And Michael Noble,
representing Minnesotans for an Energy- Efficient Economy, said the
new plan "undermines" a key part of the 1994 law, which required new
investments in wind, biomass and other "clean" energy projects.  The
bill now goes to the Senate Environment Committee, where a hearing is
scheduled for today (Friday).

<i><b>"A Very Sick Golden Goose"</b><br>
CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER, 2/5/96, p. 8B</i><br>
Editorial
<p>


In the lead editorial of yesterday's CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER, the
editors write that, "When Centerior Energy Corp. built those ghostly
silos in 1986 that mark the Perry nuclear power plant, some saw them
as the gates to Lake County's Magic Kingdom.  But the
happily-ever-after ending doesn't quite fit," as Centerior is now
asking regulators to slash plant's assessed value and its property
taxes.  That could mean that Lake County schools could lose about $2
million of the $2.3 million a year they now get in real estate taxes
from Perry.  The company also plans to ask the legislature for
personal property tax relief, the source of $20.7 million in school
tax revenue.
<p>

"Only a hermit would find" the company's moves surprising, the PLAIN
DEALER asserts.  The utility's "unreliable" nuclear generators have
never recouped their construction costs, and Centerior subsidiary
Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. is "debt-ridden and uncompetitive.
... CEI and its regulators will probably reach some compromise"
eventually, but school officials are well advised to begin cutting
costs now, the editors conclude.

<i><b>"Concern Greets Millstone Scrutiny But Most Think 3 Plants on
Watch List are Not Hazardous"</b><br>
HARTFORD COURANT, 2/2/96, p. B9</i><br>
Anthony Giorgianni <p>

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's announcement last week that it had
placed three Connecticut nuclear power plants on a safety "watch list"
drew concerned responses from local and state government officials.
<p>

NRC said that is was taking action because of five years of safety
violations at the three Millstone nuclear reactors in Waterford.  The
violations included procedural violations that in some cases
endangered plant workers; poor training of plant operators; delays in
fixing or reporting problems; and the harassment and intimidation of
employees who raised safety concerns.
<p>

One of the harshest official reactions came from state Attorney
General Richard Blumenthal, who said he would seek all necessary
remedies, including a shutdown of the plants, if they are found to be
unsafe.
<p>

But despite the listing, most sources expressed confidence that the
three Millstone nuclear power plants are safe.

<i><b>"Virginia Power Eyes Military Sideline" </b><br>
WASHINGTON TIMES, 2/4/96, p. A12</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

Richmond-based Virginia Power last week told federal authorities it is
willing to consider using its commercial nuclear power reactors to
create tritium, a gas used to boost the explosive power of hydrogen
bombs.  Spokesman James Norvelle said the utility's interest in the
idea was "mild," but he noted that as the company faces growing
competition, "we're looking for ways to make some money -- safely."
<p>

Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary first proposed the idea last October as
one option for replacing a DOE plant in South Carolina that produced
tritium until the late 1980s.  Virginia Power said it was among 17
other utilities that have expressed interest.
<p>

"Anti-nuclear groups say the idea breaches a long-guarded protection
against military use of civilian reactors."  But Jennifer Weeks of the
Union of Concerned Scientists said the option represented "the lesser
of evils" compared with building a new facility at the DOE's Savannah
River site.  Ms. Weeks also questioned whether a new source of tritium
is needed at all, since the government will be able to recycle enough
tritium from existing warheads to maintain the arsenal through 2011.

<i><b>"Power Authority's Indian Point Plant Still on Watch List"</b><br>
SYRACUSE POST-STANDARD, 2/1/96, p. B1</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

The New York Power Authority's Indian Point 3 nuclear power plant
remains on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's "watch list" because it
failed to show sustained good performance, the NRC said on January 31.
<p>

The NYPA did not disagree and admitted that more work needs to be done
on the plant.  Indian Point 3 has been on the list since June 1993,
after it went out of service in February 1993 after a backup system
failed.
<p>

The plant has been in and out of service since then, but it will not
be restarted without approval from the NRC.

<i><b>"N-Reactor Overheats During Lunch Break"</b><br>
MIAMI HERALD, 2/1/96</i><br>
Associated Press<p>

While a nuclear power plant operator left his post to microwave his
lunch on January 22, pressure built up so much in a cooling unit that
alarms went off.  The operator at Florida Power &amp; Light's St. Lucie
Nuclear Power Plant has been suspended in the wake of the incident.
<p>

The operator failed to tell control-room colleagues that he
was adjusting the reactor coolant before he left to prepare his lunch.
<p>

Officials at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission office in Atlanta,
which is not expected to issue a full report on the incident for
several weeks, insist there was no danger to the public.  Beginning in
August, St. Lucie Unit 1 was out of service for 73 days "because of
personnel errors and mechanical problems," forcing the utility to
spend $16 million purchasing electricity from other sources to meet
its obligation.

The Wolf Creek nuclear power plant near Burlington, KS was forced to
shut down on Tuesday after the water flow from an adjacent lake into
the plant was restricted by a frozen screen. When operators then tried
to slow the nuclear reaction in the core of the plant, some control
rods failed to fall into place, requiring the operators to dump boron
into reactor under emergency procedures.
<p>

Federal officials and plant managers said there was no threat to the
public from problems at the plant, which is owned by Kansas City Power

about the failure of the control rods, an NRC official said.  The
plant will not generate power while repairs are made.

ENGINEERING NEWS RECORD, 2/96 issue, p. 26</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

End-of-the year layoffs continue to make headlines across the nation,
and three energy organizations in the Northwest announced staff
reductions late in the year.
<p>

The Washington Public Power Supply System plans to cut about 100f
the work force at its Hanford nuclear reactor.  William Counsil,
Hanford plant managing director, said 130 workers over the next six
months will lose their job.  At the same time Supply System plans to
boost power production and efficiency in an effort to keep the Pacific
Northwest's only power reactor from being shut down.  Under the
cost-cutting plan, the Supply System hoped provide power to BPA at a
rate of 2.45 cents a kilowatt hour beginning on January 1 of this
year.
<p>

Two of the Northwest's investor owned utilities also announced job
layoffs attributable to increased competition. Idaho Power plans to
cut the work force in its retail services from 1,007 to 952 over the
next six months.  Idaho Power's retail unit currently has 79 positions
that are vacant or filled by temporary workers, therefore, no
full-time employees are expected to be laid off, according to Idaho
Power officials.<p>

PacifiCorp also recently announced that it will close all its customer
walk-in offices in both its Pacific Power and Utah Power divisions.
The closings will be completed by the end of 1996.  About 250
positions are expected to be eliminated.

<i><b>"Nuclear Industry Faces Charges of Cutting Corners" </b><br>
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 2/1/96, p. B4</i><br>
Ross Kerber
<p>

Deregulation of the electric power industry "is posing a potent
challenge" to the nuclear power industry, the WALL STREET JOURNAL
reports, as pressure builds to cut costs without compromising safety.
Two recent "flaps" in New England "are bringing charges that power
companies are cutting corners on safety in ways that increase the
chance of radioactive accidents."
<p>

Yesterday, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission added Northeast
Utilities' Millstone 1 plant and two sister plants to its "watch
list," after a whistle blower alleged improper management of a cooling
system.  The Maine Yankee plant in Wiscasset, ME is operating below
full power while the NRC investigates "detailed" allegations by a
whistle blower there.  The plant's primary owner, Central Maine Power
Co., had closed it for much of 1995 to fix cracks in the steam
generator.
<p>

The whistle blower in Connecticut, George Galatis, says "a new
tightfistedness at Northeast contributed to management's unwillingness
to address the problem."  The company is currently trimming its
nuclear workforce from 3,000 to about 1,000 by 2000, and Galatis
charges that layoffs make other whistle blowers less likely to come
forward.  Ted Feigenbaum, the company's chief nuclear officer, says
Northeast will improve safety as it streamlines operations.  Central
Maine also argues that its plant's troubles had nothing to do with
restructuring.
<p>
<img src="/graphics/gifs/stripe.gif">
<p>

<b><i>"NO EVIDENCE"</i></b>
<p>

"NRC officials say there is little evidence yet that reduced staffing
will lead to reduced safety."  A study several years ago found that
the Grand Gulf plant near Vicksburg, MS had a better safety record
than the Perry plant in Painesville, OH, which had twice as many
employees.
<p>

The article also quotes sources speculating that many nuclear power
plants will be forced to shut down in the coming years as deregulation
and cost concerns mount.

NRC Acting Inspector General Leo Norton wrote that the report "points

<i><b>"US: Encourage Alternative Energy Sources"</b><br>
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, 5/14/96, p. 18</i><br>
Theodore Besmann, Letter to the Editor
<p>

In a letter to the editor of the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, an Oak
Ridge National Laboratory researcher states his opinion that the
recent "run-up in gasoline prices" and the "sharp public response" has
"reawakened awareness" of America's "dangerous dependence" on Middle
East oil.  He notes that "inexplicably," as oil imports have reached
an "all-time high, we are severely cutting the budget for research and
development in energy efficiency and alternative sources."  He
attributes this "confusion" to the lack of a US energy policy.
<p>

The nation needs a strategy to encourage investment in natural gas
use, advanced transportation technologies such as electric vehicles,
and alternative energy sources, he says.  But some members of Congress
want to "eliminate virtually all government funding for energy
technology programs, including a modestly funded design program that
shares costs with industry to develop advanced nuclear power plants."
<p>

The nation cannot depend on the energy industry, which he sees
"dominated by oil companies and the staid electric utilities," to
develop the "next generation" of energy-efficient equipment and
alternative energy sources.  Dr. Besmann calls on Congress and the
Pres. to "accept responsibility and demonstrate leadership."

       that if industrial countries invested the billions they're
       putting into nuclear energy into renewable energy instead, the
       world would "finally start receiving unlimited benefits from a
       source of energy that is inexhaustible."

<i><b>"Hotter Nukes for Cooler Rates"</b><br>
BUSINESS WEEK, 5/20/96, p. 62</i><br>
Peter Coy
<p>

With competition increasing among electric utilities, some companies
are asking the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to allow nuclear power
plants to run hotter and operate longer.
<p>

A 1994 report by the Edison Electric Institute found that as of
January 1993, only 25% of US nuclear plants produced power more
cheaply than generators powered by natural gas, coal, and other energy
sources. Rather than sustain losses by shutting down, utilities want
to extract the maximum from their high-cost nuclear plants.
<p>

Turning up the rate of nuclear fission generates more electricity with
only a small increase in uranium fuel expenditure and some investment
in new equipment.  Utilities also want to run the plants 20 years past
their originally licensed 40-year life spans to improve their
economics.
<p>

As early as June, the NRC may receive an application from Northern
States Power Co. to raise the thermal output of its 25-year-old
Monticello, MN plant by 6.3% above its designed maximum of 1,670
megawatts.  The request will mark the first time a utility has asked
for an increase at a plant already operating at its design limit.
<p>

The NRC has "looked favorably" on power increases for plants that were
originally licensed to operate at less than their design
capacity. Increases within design limits have been granted to 36 of
the nation's 110 reactors, with more requests pending.
<p>

Critics charge operating plants above design limits and extending
useful lives may lead to higher accident risks.  "For regulators, the
issue comes down to this: a certain increase in cheap megawatts vs. a
best-estimate increase in risk."

<i><b>"Utility-Competition Decision Is Upheld in New Hampshire"</b><br>
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 5/14/96, p. B5</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

"The New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld a ruling by state regulators
that could allow electric utilities to compete in each other's service
territory."  Public Service Co. of New Hampshire had claimed the NH
Public Utilities Commission was wrong to order it to allow competitors
to use its transmission lines.
<p>

Separately, the state legislature is considering a plan to speed
retail competition in the state's power market, and a pilot program is
set to begin next week.  Concord-based Freedom Energy Co. said it
would file plans today that would allow it to begin selling
electricity in PSNH territory.
<p>

PSNH President William Frain said the ruling left unresolved several
issues, including "who should pay for expensive nuclear- power plants
whose cost the utility is now guaranteed to recover from ratepayers."

<i><b>"A Nuclear Power Boost?"</b><br>
DALLAS MORNING NEWS, 5/13/96, p. 7D</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

Nobel Prize-winning physicist Carlo Rubbia, at a recent meeting of the
American Physical Society in Indianapolis, unveiled the latest
energy-generation calculations for his theoretical "Energy Amplifier."
<p>

Rubbia first proposed the idea of generating electricity from nuclear
fission through the use of a small particle accelerator in 1993. His
recent announcement claims that the process would generate more than
50 times the energy needed to run the particle accelerator.
<p>

Rubbia says his approach would be safer than conventional nuclear
power plants because it does not rely on a "critical" nuclear chain
reaction.  Also, most of its radioactive wastes could be reused as
fuel, along with waste from other plants.  It only produces a small
amount of plutonium and employs thorium -- an abundant chemical -- as
a fuel source.  Rubbia says the process could also be used to split
water into hydrogen and oxygen.

<p>

Another debate about EVs "is their environmental benefit -- or lack
thereof."  The nation's auto fleet is already being replaced with
newer, cleaner models.  And Richard Tempchin of the Edison Electric
Institute "admits:" "You need a substantial number of EVs to make a
dent in smog-causing emissions."
<p>

"Another criticism" is that EVs merely transfer pollution from the
auto tailpipe to the powerplant smokestack.  But according to the
Electric Power Research Institute, a gasoline- powered car in New
England emits six times more smog precursors than the power plant
supplying electricity for an EV.  In areas where plants run on natural
gas or nuclear power, pollution from EVs could be as little as 1% of
gasoline cars, says Roland Hwang of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

       "everything is ready for electric vehicles except for one thing
       -- batteries" that can provide the convenience and performance
       consumers are accustomed to.  But he nonetheless concludes that
       EVs will find a place in America's transportation system.

WALL STREET JOURNAL, 5/13/96, p. B1</i><br>

<p>

"With the kind of intensity normally used to hawk corn chips or
compact cars, companies are starting to woo customers in New Hampshire
for one of New England's hottest commodities -- electrical power," the
WALL STREET JOURNAL reports.  In a retail- wheeling experiment seen as
a national case study, about 17,000 customers will be able to choose
their power supplier beginning May 28.  The state's "dominant"
utility, Public Service of New Hampshire, is facing about 29
competitors, and consumers can expect "a confusing array of products."
<p>

So far, pitches have included "pledges never to rely on nuclear fuel,
discounts for conservation" and free insulation and energy- management
services.  "Even Jacqueline Lake Killgore, an attorney who has worked
on deregulation issues, finds the campaign confusing," having to
choose from among several very different packages.
<p>

The "deregulation bandwagon leaves many issues unsettled," the JOURNAL
reports.  For example, PSNH's rates are the highest in the nation
partly because rates cover some costly nuclear facilities and mandates
requiring the utility to buy power from alternative suppliers. PSNH
has appealed to the public with ads "meant to raise doubts about
reform."  The utility also hints it may sue to block the program "if
it determines the new competitive environment will be unfair."

<i><b>"NRC Finds Signs Maine Yankee Plant Hid Faults in Nuclear-Safety Program"</b><br>
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 5/13/96, p. A4</i><br>
Ross Kerber
<p>

In the "latest in a string of adverse findings" related to New England
nuclear power plants, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission on May 10
issued a report finding "significant indications" that operators of
the Maine Yankee plant in Wiscasset, ME hid problems in a safety-
related computer program from the NRC.  The NRC report supported the
allegations of an anonymous whistleblower who wrote to state officials
with criticisms of the plant in December.
<p>

The report, issued by the NRC's top internal review officer, Leo
Norton, also found NRC inspectors relied too much on the plant
operators to ensure safety at Maine Yankee.  A separate NRC
investigation is underway into the conduct of Maine Yankee's owners.
Norton's report will be included in that probe.
<p>

Central Maine Power Co. owns 38% of Maine Yankee, and New England
Electric System and Northeast Utilities each hold a 20% stake in the
plant.  A Maine Yankee spokeswoman said executives wouldn't comment
until they could review the report in detail.
<p>

Some nuclear activists said the latest NRC report supports charges
that the commission is "too cozy with those it oversees."

<i><b>"City to Pay Electric Debt with Nuke Settlement"</b><br>
AUSTIN AMERICAN-STATESMAN, 5/10/96, p. B1</i><br>
Diana Dworin
<p>

Last Thursday, the Austin City Council voted 6-0 to use the money it
won in a legal settlement with Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co. to
reduce the municipal utility's debt.
<p>

The city had sued HL&amp;P, claiming $120 million in replacement power
costs caused by a 14-month shutdown of the South Texas Project nuclear
power plant in 1993 and 1994.  But last month, as the jury "seemed to
deadlock," the city settled for $20 million.
<p>

Some council members initially suggested using the money for the
city's operating expenses.  But Mayor Bruce Todd said reducing the
debt was "critical" to getting the utility ready for greater
competition in case the state legislature deregulates the power
industry.

<i><b>"TVA Moves on Bellefonte Conversion; Natural Gas, Coal in Competition as Fuel"</b><br>
COAL WEEK, 5/6/96, p. 4</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

The Tennessee Valley Authority is considering converting its
unfinished Bellefonte nuclear plant to a combined-cycle plant using
either coal, gasified coal, or natural gas as the primary fuel.  The
utility, which is preparing an EIS and 18-24 month engineering and
financial study to "evaluate development and operating alternatives,"
will hold a public hearing on 5/16/96 to receive comments on possible
environmental impacts of fossil fuel use at the plant.  Registration
for the meeting will begin at 6 p.m. at the Scottsboro High School in
Scottsboro, AL; and TVA will include comments in the draft EIS set for
public review in 2/97.  The final EIS on fossil fuel use at Bellefonte
is planned for release in 10/97.  Written comments may be submitted
before 5/31/96 to Greg Askew, TVA, 400 West Summit Dr., Knoxville TN
37902 or by e-mail to gaskew@mhs-tva.attmail.com.
<p>

Since TVA "could still complete Bellefonte as a nuclear power plant,
either alone or with a partner," and since the nuclear EIS was part of
the original construction permit, the May meeting "will not address"
the nuclear option.

<i><b>"Radiation Expert to Eyeball Seabrook"</b><br>

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on May 8 announced that it is
sending a radiation expert to the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New
Hampshire to investigate events which took place on November 29, 1995.
On that date, "unprecedented" levels of radiation were detected in
towns near the plant, after the facility released high levels of
radiation from a vent stack.  The NRC dismissed Seabrook as a possible
source of the excess radiation.
<p>

But Jim Muckerheide of the MA emergency management office said the
move indicates that the NRC is not confident in its own initial
investigation.  Muckerheide and the MA Attorney General's office claim
that Seabrook and the NRC have never documented the plant's non-
involvement in the incident.
<p>

So far, no one has been able to explain where the above-average levels
of radiation originated, although Seabrook officials claim that "no
abnormal radiation levels" were found at the plant.
<p>

"Seabrook spokesman Rob Williams said the plant will cooperate when
NRC radiation specialist Jason Jang arrives for a two-day probe May
29."

<i><b>"High-Level Waste"</b><br>
DETROIT NEWS, 5/8/96, p. A12</i><br>
Editorial
<p>

"At last it has surfaced -- the one aspect of American life the
Clinton administration has no interest in controlling.  The president
is promising to veto legislation that finally would force the federal
government to centralize storage of high-level nuclear waste," the
editorial page editors of the DETROIT NEWS write.  The editorial notes
the federal gov't has applied more than $5.8 billion of its $11
billion nuclear waste trust fund to deficit reduction -- "waste,
considering Washington's profligate habits" -- and a permanent
repository is not expected to be completed before 2011.  "Shuttered
reactors would make the environmental lobby very happy," but
"windmills and solar panels are incapable of replacing the 20% of the
nation's electricity generated by nuclear power."
<p>

The Clinton admin. wants a permanent storage site chosen at the same
time an interim site is chosen, and it wants the EPA to be in on the
environmental impact statement.  "But this would only guarantee that a
storage facility would never get sited."
<p>

The editorial notes Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS) "has been
pretty nervous" about bringing the bill to the floor, but it's "long
past time" for such action, the editors assert.  It is "incumbent on
the House and Senate to approve the bill by margins wide enough to
override" the president's anticipated veto, the editorial concludes.

The attorney general for Massachusetts has requested a federal

the events which took place on November 29, 1995 when the plant
released high levels of radiation from a vent stack.

Higher-than-normal levels of radiation were detected on November 29,

The NRC, Northeast Utilities -- which owns the Seabrook plant -- and
the MA Health Dept. have not been able to determine another source for
the radiation in MA, even though Jim Martin of NU has said that the

<i><b>"Volunteers Sought:  Communities Interested in Being Host to N-Waste Site Can Drive Hard Bargain"</b><br>
HARRISBURG PATRIOT, 5/3/96, p. A </i><br>
Editorial
<p>

The administration of Gov. Tom Ridge (R) of Pennsylvania, in search of
a community to host a low-level-radioactive waste repository, is
holding a series of "open houses" starting in Chambersburg on 5/7/96.
The HARRISBURG PATRIOT commends the effort, even though it "ultimately
may prove futile." Finding a community willing to accept the
radioactive effluvium from nuclear plants, hospitals, research
facilities and industry "surely is preferable" to imposing it on a
community "arbitrarily selected."  The 1988 PA enabling law, "crafted
to allow for maximum flexibility," puts a willing community in an
"extraordinarily powerful position" to negotiate a favorable contract,
"both in terms of safeguards and economic benefits."  Minimum benefits
include two full-time inspectors; payment of property taxes of
individuals living within two miles of the facility; training and
equipping of local police, fire, and emergency services; and annual
payments--to be negotiated--to the municipality.  Although "none of
this is to suggest" that hosting a nuclear waste storage area is
"without risk," the "genie is out of the bottle," and "there is no
choice" but to store this material in the safest possible way and be
prepared to generously reward those communities willing to assume the
burden.

<i><b>"Report Sees Rate War Hurting Power Supply"</b><br>
BOSTON GLOBE ONLINE, 5/7/96</i><br>
Scott Allen
<p>

Greater competition in the electric power industry "could force the
early shutdown of as many as seven of New England's eight nuclear
power plants," according to a new study done by Resource Insight for
Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger.  In fact, the
Pilgrim plant in Plymouth, MA and Millstone I and II in Waterford, CT
"are likely to lose so much money ... that they should be closed now,"
the report said.
<p>

Utility officials said it's too early to make such speculations since
no state has finalized the details of the transition to competitive
power markets and because nuclear plant managers are cutting costs to
prepare for competition.  Managers at both Millstone and Pilgrim have
cut hundreds of jobs, the BOSTON GLOBE reports.  Environmentalists are
worried, however, that such cutbacks could spur safety problems.
<p>

If nuclear plants are shut down, "it could force major changes" in the
regional economy, the GLOBE notes.  Nuclear reactors account for 26%
of the region's power supply.  Massachusetts Electric could benefit,
the study finds, because it operates so many inexpensive hydroelectric
dams.

<i><b>"HL&amp;P Officials Upbeat Over Nuclear Plant Deal"</b><br>
HOUSTON CHRONICLE, 5/2/96, p. 1A</i><br>
Jerry Urban and George Flynn
<p>

Houston Lighting and Power Co. on May 1 offered to pay the city of
Austin, TX $20 million in an out-of-court settlement which ends a two-
year-old, $120 million lawsuit over HL&amp;P's management of the
2,500- megawatt South Texas Project.  The suit was meant to recover
losses from a year-long outage of HL&amp;P's plant in 1993, when
Austin was forced to replace lost energy.
<p>

The settlement could "open the door" for the implementation of an
independent management company to operate the Bay City nuclear plant
in Matagorda County -- a not-so-uncommon practice in the nuclear
industry. HL&amp;P general counsel Hugh Kelly said that it would cost
HL&amp;P less than $1 million to transfer operations to an independent
management company.
<p>

Central Power and Light, which owns 25.2% of the plant, has openly
supported the idea of an independent manager, and Kelly said that
HL&amp;P is "very confident" that the city of San Antonio will also
support the plan.  San Antonio is suing HL&amp;P for $150 million for
costs associated with the 1993 shutdown.

<center><h3>DEADLOCKED JURY?</h3></center>

Austin agreed to the settlement because the jury appeared to be
deadlocked on the case.  Austin spent about $12 million on legal fees
and wanted to avoid the cost of another trial.  Jury foreman Charles
Moore said the settlement roughly parallels the verdict toward which
the jury was aiming.
<p>

Moore added that the jury was quite critical of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's role in the operations and oversight of the project.  NRC
spokesman Breck Henderson said the commission's will see that the
plant is run safely under any new management.
<p>

Analysts say the settlement should not significantly affect HL&amp;P
because settlements generally clear away any uncertainties.
HL&amp;P's Kelly agreed: "This settlement will have a very beneficial
effect.  The litigation has been very demoralizing to all involved.
We will now have a cooperative joint direction."

<p>

Vermont's Green Mountain Power Corp. has withdrawn its proposal for
"an experimental program of cut-rate electricity sales," fearing
summer power shortages due to the shutdown of the Millstone nuclear
power plant in Connecticut.
<p>

"With the recent unplanned outages of the nuclear plants and new
information about potentially tight capacity this summer, the
assumptions underlying our price test suddenly have changed," said

<i><b>"NRC Looks at Forcing TVA to Create Reactor-Closing Fund"</b><br>
NASHVILLE TENNESSEAN, 5/2/96, p. 4B</i><br>
Aassociated Press, Duncan Mansfield
<p>

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is being urged by its inspector
general's office to require the Tennessee Valley Authority -- "the
largest US public power producer" -- to maintain a separate fund to
pay for decommissioning obsolete nuclear power plants.
<p>

Currently, TVA must only present a "statement of intent" that it will
pay for decommissioning its three nuclear facilities in southeast
Tennessee and north Alabama.  It is exempted from the rule that
applies to investor-owned utilities because it is a federal
corporation.
<p>

The TVA actually set up its own decommissioning fund in 1977, but
without NRC regulations to stop the TVA from doing so, the utility
depleted the fund in 1993, relying on the assumption that the federal
government would pay for the TVA if the utility weren't able to do so
by itself.
<p>

Stephen Smith of Tennessee Valley Energy Reform Coalition in
Knoxville: "If TVA gets into a financial crunch, they will liquidate
this fund again.  I guarantee it."
<p>

The inspector general's report said the decommissioning requirements
the NRC set for TVA may not be sufficient.  But NRC inspector general
spokesman Bill McDowell "conceded [on April 30] the amount TVA
has set aside is 'within the realm of reasonableness' of what will be
required."

<i><b>"Morale Problems Emerge as Plant Continues to Cut Jobs"</b><br>
RALEIGH NEWS AND OBSERVER, 4/30/96, p. B1</i><br>
Jay Price
<p>

"With another straight-A report card from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission," one would expect the workers at Carolina Power &amp;
Light's Shearon Harris nuclear power plant to "be whistling like the
Seven Dwarfs."  But the Raleigh-based utility has a morale problem
stemming from continuing layoffs.
<p>

This summer, CP&amp;L plans to cut 200 jobs from its nuclear group,
after cutting 100 positions in the group in August 1994 and 150
workers throughout the company in 1995.  "Company officials say
downsizing is part of a continuous program to become more efficient in
the face of rising competitive pressures."  Both CP&amp;L and the NRC
say the layoffs do not threaten the plant's "integrity."  Yet the next
round of job cuts "raises the nebulous question of how much cutting
can be done without compromising the safety margin," the RALEIGH NEWS
AND OBSERVER reports.
<p>

"The stakes are high for CP&amp;L."  A study released last year found
CP&amp;L is among the utilities "most vulnerable" in a competitive
market due to high rates and fixed costs.  The article continues by
reviewing layoffs and associated safety concerns at nuclear utilities
nationwide.

Knight-Ridder Financial Wire Report
<p>

"Westinghouse Electric Corp. [yesterday] said it reached 'an amicable
settlement' with Portland General Electric and PacifiCorp over a
lawsuit involving steam generators supplied by Westinghouse to the
Trojan nuclear power plant."
<p>

Portland General operates the Trojan nuclear plant and had closed in
1993 "after several years of extensive steam-generator repairs."
Portland General filed suit against Westinghouse in February 1993.
Before yesterday, Westinghouse had already reached a settlement with
the city of Eugene Water and Electric Board, which also owns a stake
in Trojan.
<p>

Westinghouse reached a settlement last week in a similar suit
involving Northern States Power in Minnesota.  Westinghouse still has
two steam-generator suits outstanding; one with Chicago-based
Commonwealth Edison and the other with Newark, NJ- based Public
Service Electric &amp; Gas.

<i><b>"Former Nuclear Facility Resumes Electricity Production"</b><br>
COLORADO SPRINGS GAZETTE-TELEGRAPH ONLINE, 5/2/96</i><br>

<p>

A former nuclear power plant in Platteville, CO resumed operations on
Tuesday as a 130-megawatt natural-gas-fired unit.  The Fort St.  Vrain
plant was operated as a nuclear facility for 10 years, until August
1989, when Public Service Co. of Colorado decided to make the fuel

Virginia Power executives say their nuclear power plants are "totally

Friday.  In one of two lengthy features that ran in this paper last
Sunday, the reporter recalls the industry's most notable troubles with
nuclear plants, and the subsequent "soul-searching" investigations and

The article also notes that of the 84 reactors that have been shut
down worldwide, the average life span was 17 years -- far less than
the average 40-year lifespan predicted.

Environmental protests have lessened, but that is largely because no
new plants have been commissioned in years.  Today, environmental
concerns center on nuclear waste, the reporter concludes, recapping
the undecided status of the US nuclear-waste policy debate.

<i><b>"Search for Nuclear Waste Site"</b><br>
SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER, 4/29/96, p. A3</i><br>
Holly Yeager
<p>

The U.S. Senate is set to consider a bill that would "tilt the odds
even further" toward making Yucca Mountain in the NV desert the
permanent storage site for the nation's high-level nuclear waste.
Legislation, crafted by Sen. Larry Craig (R-ID), would authorize a
temporary storage facility a few miles from Yucca Mountain ready to
accept materials from commercial power plants by 1/31/99. It also
would accept spent fuel from Navy nuclear subs, now stored at the
Idaho National Engineering Lab.  Critics argue that making Yucca
Mountain the temporary site will make it the "de facto permanent"
site; since it is "unlikely" that "dangerous waste" would be reshipped
out of NV.
<p>

The problem is that 26 of the nation's 110 nuclear reactors will fill
up their on-site storage space for spent fuel by 1998; and by 2010 --
the earliest date for a permanent facility -- 80 reactors will run out
of space.  The POST-INTELLIGENCER quotes Leigh Ann Marshall,
spokesperson for the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's
Washington-based trade assn., as stating that, without quick action,
the electric utilities are "either going to have to shut down or ask
their ratepayers to pay to build additional on-site storage
facilities."

destroy "incentives" for local governments to accept "controversial"
industries.  The bill also targets Entergy Corp.'s River Bend nuclear

Managers of the Oyster Creek, NJ nuclear power plant are trying to
determine exactly what caused an automatic shutdown at 2:55 a.m. on
Tuesday morning.  The reactor shut itself down while powering up
"because of a low water level reading in the core," a plant spokesman
said.  It wasn't known why the water level was low, but investigators
suspect plant operators did not switch open a set of valves that fills
the reactor core with water.

The spokesman said no equipment failure was detected, and there was
enough water inside the reactor to prevent overheating.  The US
Nuclear Regulatory Commission was notified, and since there was no
safety risk, plant officials expected to restart the reactor last
night.

<i><b>"Millstone Shutdown Could Crimp Competition in New Hampshire"</b><br>
BOSTON GLOBE ONLINE, 4/30/96</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

"Rising wholesale electricity prices" may force the New Hampshire
Public Utilities Commission to revise the retail- wheeling pilot
program set to begin in that state on May 28.  Rising prices may be
due to the shutdown of Northeast Utilities' Millstone nuclear power
plant in Connecticut, the Associated Press reports.
<p>

To salvage the program, the PUC may have to raise the "assumed market
price," or the price at which it expects customers to be able to buy
electricity on the open market.  Under current plans, residential
customers automatically get a 10% discount as an incentive to
participate in the pilot, but the discount will be less if they pay a
price higher than the assumed market price.  If the discount becomes
too small, "customers might not want to bother choosing from as many
as 20 competing suppliers."  High wholesale prices might also affect
which suppliers are willing to compete, the AP reports.
<p>

Although the PUC discussed the issue on Monday, no decision has been
made, an official said.  The commission may soon hold hearings on the
issue.

<i><b>"Residents Say They Don't Trust Nuclear Officials"</b><br>
BOSTON GLOBE ONLINE, 4/30/96</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

Residents near the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in Wiscasset, ME
told federal regulators "they are worried" about the plant's safety
and they "don't trust plant officials or regulators to protect them
from radiation."  About 350 people attended a meeting with officials
of Maine Yankee and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<p>

Maine Yankee managers presented an analysis that shows the recently
repaired cooling system works correctly.  If the NRC agrees -- in a
process that is expected to last two to three months -- the plant will
be allowed to return to full power for the first time since January
1995.
<p>

Maine Gov. Angus King (I) said Monday the state has hired Purdue U. 
nuclear engineering Professor Victor Ransom to review Maine Yankee's 
analysis of the cooling system.

<i><b>"N.E. Utilities Warn of Summer Power Shortages" </b><br>
BOSTON GLOBE, 4/26/96, p. B6</i><br>
Jerry Ackerman
<p>

New England's electric utilities are warning that the region faces
"brownouts" in many areas and periodic blackouts in parts of
Connecticut, due to the shutdown of three Northeast Utilities nuclear
power plants in Connecticut.  Utility officials said that with a hot
summer and a possible fourth shut down of an NU plant, rolling
brownouts and even blackouts may be necessary.
<p>

Some public officials said the warning letters sent by the New England
Power Pool may be efforts to hasten the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's investigations into some area plants.  The review of NU's
Millstone 3 could be finished by June, but those for 1 and 2 could
take until August.
<p>

State regulators have responded by telling utilities to take
extraordinary measures to combat possible shortages, such as
increasing the power capacity of transmission lines and leasing
emergency generators.
<p>

Even though NU has vowed not to pass on the cost of finding alternate
energy sources to customers, other utilities in the region might have
to raise their rates.  Jeffrey Tranen of New England Electric System
-- the region's second largest utility -- said the situation may push
the spot price of power under emergency conditions to triple the
normal level.

<i><b>"Fears About WPPSS Bonds Are Revived" </b><br>
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 4/29/96, p. C1</i><br>
Fred Vogelstein
<p>

"Just when many in the Northwest thought they finally had lived down
the tortured legacy of the giant bond default known as Whoops, it is
rearing its head again."  A nuclear power plant owned by the
Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) defaulted on its $2.25
billion debt in 1983, spawning 12 years of litigation over the
municipal bonds.  But now, as policy makers seek to restructure the
federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, "no one can seem to
get around the fact the BPA is the ultimate backer" of the WPPSS
bonds, whose annual debt service of nearly $500 million a year
consumes about 20% of BPA's annual expenses.
<p>

The BPA "may have an easier time adjusting" to power industry
restructuring because "political considerations" may drive decisions
and the agency "remains one of the cheapest power producers in the
country." Yet BPA "has been fighting for its life" against lower-cost
gas-fired power plants, and it is under pressure to spend more to
protect endangered salmon species.
<p>

"Few anticipate another WPPS default, but a ratings downgrade is a
possibility," the WALL STREET JOURNAL reports.
<p>

Meanwhile, a 20-member committee representing the utility's various
constituencies, backed by the region's governors, is preparing a list
of options by July 15 for BPA restructuring, with a report to the
governors by Labor Day and to Congress by December 1.

<i><b>"Northeast Utilities, Despite Ills, Shows Lots of Energy"</b><br>
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 4/24/96, p. B4</i><br>
Ross Kerber
<p>

Despite troubles at its Millstone nuclear power complex, CT- based
Northeast Utilities is "leading the charge into the era of utility
deregulation," the WALL STREET JOURNAL reports in its "Corporate
Focus" column.  Frank Sabatino, Northeast's vice president for
wholesale power sales, said the utility closed 14 new contracts in
1995 and is getting ready to complete six more.  The utility is also
competing for customers in New Hampshire's retail-wheeling pilot
project.  And it has applied for permission to export power to Quebec.
<p>

"In part, Northeast's push for new customers is a bet" by its CEO,
Bernard Fox, that the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission will let the
company restart the Millstone reactors within a few months.  If that
happens, "the wholesale contracts that Northeast has negotiated will
keep it in the game."  But if the shutdown continues beyond early
1997, NU's replacement power bills will mount, "further complicating
its problems."  The company expects to provide documents to the NRC by
the end of August to allow a restart.
<p>

"Analysts said the lack of Millstone's power would become a
company-threatening problem only if two of the three reactors ...
remain off-line for a year or more."  The company's management also
has other defenders.  Despite a whistleblowers' charges that managers
ignored safety guidelines and deceived the NRC, Millstone engineer
Michael Ahearn told a public hearing that he has found managers "very
receptive" to concerns he has raised in the past.

<i><b>"Supreme Court Backs TMI Accident Lawsuits"</b><br>
PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 4/23/96, p. A8</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

The US Supreme Court yesterday declined to hear the nuclear power
industry's appeal seeking to block more than 2,000 individuals who
claim they were injured by radiation from the 1979 Three Mile Island
accident from receiving punitive damages under Pennsylvania law.
<p>

The plaintiffs can now seek punitive and compensatory damages, opening
the door to possible multi-million dollar awards.  A group of 10 test
cases is scheduled to go to trial in June and will consider whether
the 3/79 "partial meltdown" at Three Mile Island caused the alleged
injuries and whether damages should be awarded.
<p>

About 1,000 people with injuries or their survivors have suits pending
against Metropolitan Edison, General Public Utilities Corp.  and other
companies involved with the plant.
<p>

A federal appeals court in Philadelphia last year ruled that
individuals injured by the accident could try to recover punitive
damages under state law.  It rejected the defendants' argument that
such claims were barred under amendments adopted by Congress in 1988
to the Price-Anderson Act, which governs the nation's nuclear power

<i><b>"Pickering Stills All Eight Reactors"</b><br>
TORONTO GLOBE &amp; MAIL, 4/22/96, p. A1</i><br>
Michael Grange
<p>

All eight reactors at Ontario Hydro's Pickering nuclear generating
plant were shut down this past weekend due to a "flaw" in the plant's
secondary safety system.  Spokesmen for Hydro and the Atomic Energy
Control Board said on April 21 that the problem did not compromise
public safety.
<p>

The shutdown "punctuates a difficult stretch" for Canada's largest
nuclear energy facility.  Sixteen months ago, Pickering nuclear
station A was shut down due to a broken pipe.  Eight months ago, Hydro
was ordered to improve safety practices or face penalties.  Last week,
radioactive heavy water from one of Pickering's reactors leaked into
Lake Ontario.
<p>

The reactors -- which provide about 20% of Hydro's electrical
generating capacity -- may be decommissioned for eight to 10 days.
However, a Pickering spokesman said some of the reactors may be
operational by April 24 or 25.

<i><b>"NU Violations Were Intentional, Lawyer Says"</b><br>
HARTFORD COURANT, 4/19/96, p. F2</i><br>
Barbara Nagy
<p>

"The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has determined that Northeast
Utilities intentionally violated the conditions of its operating
license for the Millstone 1 nuclear power plant" in Waterford, CT,
according to Massachusetts lawyer Ernest Hadley, who is representing
whistleblower George Galatis.
<p>

Hadley said that the NRC has found that NU willfully refueled Unit 1
incorrectly.  After Galatis reported the refueling problem to the NRC
last year, the agency put all three Millstone units on its "watch
list" and ordered them to stay closed indefinitely.
<p>

"NRC spokesman Victor Dricks wouldn't confirm Hadley's version of the
refueling report, and said it's unlikely that the full document will
ever be made public."  If the report contains allegations of willful
wrongdoing, the NRC will take its findings to the Justice Department
for possible criminal prosecution.

AUSTIN AMERICAN-STATESMAN, 4/19/96, p. B4</i><br>
Matt Schwartz
<p>

After seven weeks of testimony and evidence, a Harris County, TX jury
is set to hear final arguments today in the City of Austin's $120
million lawsuit against Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co.  Austin is
suing HL&amp;P for negligence, claiming its mismanagement of the South
Texas Project nuclear power plant led to a 14-month shutdown that cost
the city millions for replacement power.
<p>

HL&amp;P rested its case on April 18 with the testimony of a
University of Texas professor who told the jury the city suffered no
damages during the shutdown for repairs in 1993 and 1994 because the
extra operating and maintenance costs were reasonable.  Witness Martin
Baughman said that because STP would have been shutdown for much of
the same period for equipment repairs, the amount of time the plant
was closed for regulatory reasons was a reasonable burden of owning a
nuclear facility. Baughman estimated that even if the city did suffer,
the damages were "at most" only $8.7 million.

NEW YORK TIMES, 4/20/96, p. 1</i><br>

<p>

"Two years after the first reports that nuclear material had been
smuggled out of the former Soviet Union," the US and Russia are
"already collaborating" on a program to help safeguard Russia's
nuclear materials, reports the NEW YORK TIMES in a lengthy, front-page
article.
<p>

While progress is slow, officials are making steady progress in
setting up security systems for the vast store of nuclear material
scattered at sites across the former Soviet Union.
<p>

"So far there is no evidence that nuclear materials have been acquired
by would-be nuclear powers of terrorist groups."  But many experts
believe that it is only a matter of time until a serious incident
occurs, and say that money and efforts to guard against theft needs to
be doubled.

<i><b>"One Big Dump"</b><br>
ECONOMIST, 4/20/96, p. 22</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

Three main obstacles that have raised concerns have yet to be resolved
by the "army of scientists and technicians at Yucca Mountain," the
potential dump site for the nation's worst nuclear waste.  Energy
Dept. officials will determine by the end of the decade whether the
site in south-western Nevada will safely contain nuclear waste
produced by the US's 100-plus commercial nuclear reactors and its
armed forces.
<p>

Scientists remained concerned about a potential volcanic eruption --
the region has a history of volcanic activity.  They are also worried
about the proximity of the area to a fault line which may cause
earthquakes.  But their "chief concern" is water.  When the containers
containing the nuclear waste begin to decompose, the surrounding rock
should stop any penetration to the surface.  But the movement of water
"could let radionuclides past this natural barrier."

Minneapolis-based Northern States Power Co. said yesterday it had
suspended its negotiations with the Mescalero Apache tribe over a
possible storage site for spent nuclear fuel on tribal land in New
Mexico.
<p>

"Like other utilities with nuclear plants," NSP currently stores spent

MILWAUKEE JOURNAL SENTINEL, 4/17/96, p. 1D</i><br>
Lee Bergquist
<p>

The Wisconsin Public Service Commission on April 16 voted 3-0 to allow
Wisconsin Electric Power Co. to replace two steam generators at the
Point Beach nuclear power plant at a cost of $94 million.  WEPCO said
the decision ensures that the plant will stay in operation well into
the next century.
<p>

Without the ruling, WEPCO would have been forced to close the plant --
which provides 300f the utility's electricity -- and find a
replacement energy source.  WEPCO said it hopes to have the generators
replaced by the end of this year.  The PSC also decided to allow WEPCO
to continue storing spent nuclear fuel rods in concrete and steel
casks outside the utility's plants in Manitowoc County because storage
space at the Point Beach plant is running out.
<p>

David Merritt, executive director of the Madison-based public interest
group Citizens' Utility Board: "The three PSC commissioners once again
turned their backs on everybody but Wisconsin Electric."  Merritt said
his group was strongly considering a lawsuit to block the project.

<i><b>"Northeast Utilities, Workers Violated Procedures at Nuclear Plant, NRC Says"</b><br>
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 4/18/96, p. A4</i><br>
Ross Kerber
<p>

The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has concluded that employees at
Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities operated the Millstone nuclear
power plant improperly, and "willfully" filed "misleading" reports to
the NRC about the plant.
<p>

The findings were first described publicly by Ernest Hadley, an
attorney for NU engineer George Galatis, who filed the allegations of
"corporate misconduct" last year.  An unidentified NRC official
confirmed to the WALL STREET JOURNAL that Mr. Hadley's description of
the findings was accurate.
<p>

An NRC probe found that NU employees "knew they were violating the
company's operating guidelines when they moved the entire fuel core of
the Millstone 1 reactor into its cooling pools in one step," instead
of in stages.  Investigators also concluded the company "knowingly
filed false documents about the procedure to the agency."
<p>

The NRC is now considering whether to impose fines or seek criminal
charges against the utility.  An NU spokesman said the company had not
seen the NRC report and had no comment.

<i><b>"NRC To Reconsider Funding Rules Due To Restructuring" </b><br>
PUBLIC UTILITIES WEEKLY, 4/12/96, p.1</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

In an effort to show changes brought about by the restructuring and
deregulation of the electric industry, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission is contemplating amending its regulations on nuclear-plant
decommissioning and funding.  The NRC will take comments until June 24
before proposing a rule.
<p>

Current regulations allow utilities more flexibility than non- utility
licensees in providing financial security.  The NRC wonders whether a
nuclear power licensee would have to forfeit a regulated rate base to
offset the unfunded balance of decommissioning expenses.
<p>

NRC is considering requiring licensees to: (1) guarantee they can
finance the full decommissioning cost if they are no longer assured a
source of income; and (2) provide periodic progress reports on their
decommissioning funds.
<p>

NRC is contemplating allowing licensees to receive credit for a
positive, real rate return on decommissioning funds while the plant is
"maintained in a condition that allows radioactivity on site to
decay." NRC will also decide whether federal government licensees
should continue to be allowed to use statements of intent to meet
decommissioning financial assurance requirements.

<p>

Sen. Rod Grams (R-MN) yesterday introduced a bill to abolish the US
Dept. of Energy and transfer its functions to other agencies within
three years.  Noting Pres. Clinton's remark that "the era of big
government is over," Grams said, "What better way to carry out this
pledge than to start dismantling an agency with no mission, no purpose
and no legitimate future?"  <p>

Grams's bill would shift DOE's cleanup of nuclear-weapons- related
sites, its power marketing administrations (PMAs) and its national
labs to the Pentagon, while transferring basic energy research and the
Energy Information Administration to the Interior Dept.  Grams said
his bill would save between $19-23 billion over five years.  <p>

The Energy Dept. "ridiculed" Grams's proposal in a statement: "There
they go again.  A few extremists who have run out of issues ...  are
now recycling an old, failed idea. ... Democrats and reasonable
Republicans agree -- it's a dumb idea."  Grams acknowledged his bill
had little chance of passage this year "but said it was important to
get the process started."

<i><b>"Nuclear Waste"</b><br>
MINNEAPOLIS STAR-TRIBUNE, 4/12/96, p. A24</i><br>
Editorial
<p>

"Failure to find a solution to the political mess at Prairie Island,
Minnesota, is one of the most toxic outcomes of the past legislative
session," says the MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE.
<p>

Instead of working towards positive solutions, "a discredited and
costly search for a second radioactive-waste storage site in Goodhue
County was allowed to continue another year, draining state coffers,
picking ratepayers' pockets and wasting valuable political energy and
capital."  Two deals between Northern States Power Co. and the tribe
have fallen apart.
<p>

Ratepayers lose because the expensive search process must now
continue.  "Tribal leaders should recognize" that an end to the "good
faith" effort required of NSP to seek an alternative storage site
could cost them dearly, the TRIBUNE says.  "When the legislature
convenes next January, an agreement had better be in hand to end this
wasteful struggle."

<i><b>"WEAPONS MAY FUEL REACTORS"</b><br>
PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 4/12/96, P. B1,</i><br>
Mark Jaffe
<p>

Philadelphia's Peco Energy Co. is "one of a handful of utilities" that
is "exploring the possibility" of using fuel made from decommissioned
nuclear warheads to generate electricity at its nuclear power plants.
"But because the plutonium could be removed and used to make nuclear
weapons, the fuel might become a target for terrorists," critics like
Greenpeace contend.
<p>

The US Dept. of Energy is considering three ways to dispose of 42 tons
of weapons-grade plutonium: encasing it in glass or ceramics and
storing it; burying it deep underground; or using it as reactor fuel.
The DOE would have to build a factory to produce the fuel, known as
mixed oxide or MOX.  "One of the reasons DOE is considering the MOX
fuel" is that it would destroy the weapons-grade plutonium.
<p>

Peco spokesman William Jones said, "It is just something we're
expressed interest in, if the DOE picks up the cost and there is a net
benefit for our customers."  Jones recalled the "no lose" situation
when Peco took slightly used fuel from the Shoreham nuclear power
plant on Long Island, getting $70 million in "free fuel" for just $50
million in transportation costs.
<p>

Scott Peters, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute: "The
industry probably feels that dismantling weapons and taking plutonium
and burning it up reduces risks to world peace.  If it makes economic
sense."
<p>

The DOE will review public comments on the issue this spring and
settle on a plan "later this year."

<i><b>"PERRY RUNNING AGAIN AFTER FIXES, REFUELING"</b><br>
CLEVELAND PLAIN-DEALER, 4/11/96, P. 3B,</i><br>
Jim Nichols
<p>

The Perry nuclear power plant, which is operated by the Cleveland
Electric Illuminating Co., a subsidiary of Centerior Energy Corp., is
"up and running again," after a brief refueling and repair shutdown.
Officials said technicians cleared up virtually all 2,800 slated
repairs and tests for the plant, many of which were ordered under an
agreement between Centerior and the Federal Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
<p>

Operators replaced 280 bundles of uranium-filled fuel rods, including
one rod which was found to be leaking radioactive gas into the
reactor, prompting fears that the plant's cooling system could be
contaminated.  Officials said that radioactivity did not end up
exposing workers.  The plant began test runs on April 10 and is
scheduled to return to full power by today.

<i><b>"JUDGE RULES AGAINST PGE PROFIT ON TROJAN"</b><br>
PORTLAND OREGONIAN, 4/9/96, P. B11,</i><br>
Bill Mackenzie
<p>

A Marion County Circuit Court judge ruled on April 5 that Portland
General Electric can't earn a profit on its stranded investment in the
Trojan nuclear power plant in Rainier, which closed in January 1993.
However, PGE said it will appeal the ruling, and according to Roxanne
Bailey of PGE, "there's already a pretty good track record
that it will turn out in our favor."
<p>

After Trojan closed, PGE asked the Oregon Public Utility Commission to
decide how to handle the recovery of the company's remaining
undepreciated investment in the plant and whether the company could
earn an additional return on it.  The commission, another Marion
County circuit Court judge and the state attorney general all have
supported PGE's right to receive a return on its investment through
rate increases.
<p>

Friday's decision allows PGE to recover its investment, but not to
earn a profit on it.

<i><b>"NIMO FACES NRC INQUIRY"</b><br>
SYRACUSE POST-STANDARD, 4/9/96, P. A9,</i><br>
Mary Jo Hill
<p>

The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission today will question Niagara
Mohawk Power Corp. about steps it took to correct a problem with an
incorrectly-sized bolt that was installed on a pressure relief panel
years ago at the Nine Mile Point 1 nuclear plant.  The meeting does
not mean that a violation took place or that punishment will ensue,
according to an NRC statement.  The NRC just wants to know why it took
almost a year and a half to correct the problem, said Barry Norris of
the NRC.
<p>

Niagara Mohawk maintains that the faulty bolts would have come off
before "meaningful damage" could be caused to the building where they
were housed.  Norris said that the bolts were excessively large, and
would have let pressure behind the panels build up beyond normal
levels before blowing off.

<i><b>"CHANGING FACE OF NUCLEAR POWER"</b><br>
JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, 4/12/96, P. 7A,</i><br>
Arthur Gottschalk, OP-ED
<p>

As the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion
approaches next week, an international conference in Vienna is
examining the resulting human health problems "which continue to
rise," and a special meeting of the G-7 industrial nations is being
convened to consider what to do about the 15 Chernobyl-style reactors
still operating in Russia, Ukraine, and Lithuania.
<p>

But while those discussions proceed, JOURNAL OF COMMERCE reporter
Arthur Gottschalk says "an even more fundamental question remains ...
: What to do with the thousands of tons of high-level radioactive
waste produced by the 432 reactors now operating in 30 countries."
Those plants produce 230f the world's electricity, but by 2015, they
will have produced 220,000 metric tons of "deadly" spent fuel that
will remain "highly dangerous to living things for at least 10,000
years." None of the countries that operate nuclear reactors has found
"the definitive answer" to this problem, Gottschalk writes.
<p>

The columnist then reviews the disposal debate in the US, noting the
slow development the Yucca Mountain long-term storage facility and the
1998 deadline for DOE to take spent fuel from utilities for interim
storage.  If the US can complete the Yucca Mountain project, the US
would be the first to address the long-term storage issue, which would
be "only fitting for the first nation to develop nuclear power in the
first place."  With 132 new nuclear plants on the drawing boards or
under construction around the world, "it's time to get serious about
solving the nuclear industry's most pressing problem," Gottschalk
concludes.

<i><b>"Row Over Death Toll From Worst Nuclear Disaster"</b><br>
London Independent, 4/10/96, P. 8,</i><br>
Adrian Bridge
<p>

"Ten years after Chernobyl, international experts are gathering this
week in Vienna to take stock of the scientific, medical and social
impact of the world's worst nuclear disaster."  About 700 delegates
are attending the meeting, which is sponsored by the International
Atomic Energy Agency, European Commission and the World Health
Organization.  Special panels focus on public perception of the
accident, as well as its enviro, economic and political impacts.
<p>

Ukrainian Prime Minister Yevhen Marchuck on Tuesday told attendees
that his country "still has not gotten adequate financial support to
solve this problem."  Under a deal signed in December 1995, Ukraine
agreed to shut the plant by 2000 in return for billions of dollars in
aid from the "Group of 7" industrial nations.  "Last week, the G-7
upped its offer to $3.1 billion in an apparent effort to accelerate
the shutdown."  The issue seems likely to come up at the upcoming G-7
summit in Moscow on April 19-20.  The Ukraine has previously asked for
$4 billion in aid.
<p>

Ukrainian officials say 125,000 Ukrainians died as a direct result of
the accident, with tens of thousands more made ill from radiation.
Western experts dispute that, saying the number of deaths attributable
to the accident could be as low as 45.

       cannot happen again."  Improvements to the RMBK reactor design
       and the growth of a Western-style "safety culture" have made it
       "impossible" for a similar accident to occur, he said.

<i><b>STUDY:  MANY NUCLEAR PLANTS UNSAFE"</b><br>
LAS VEGAS SUN, 4/9/96,</i><br>
Mary Manning
<p>

"Promises of an energy paradise driven by atomic power had no
engineering foundation," according to a report released yesterday by
the MD-based Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, an
industry critic.  An "exhaustive" review of archival material shows
"nuclear power was born of compromises on safety questions, government
subsidies" and decisions by General Electric and Westinghouse to take
"huge losses" on initial orders, the LAS VEGAS SUN reports.  Records
show "industry and government leaders clearly understood that nuclear
power would be expensive and difficult to develop."
<p>

The study also concludes that there are no private insurers likely to
cover nuclear power accidents on the scale of the 1986 Chernobyl
accident in the Ukraine.  The report also claims nuclear safety issues
cannot be resolved fast enough to allow it to contribute to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions.

<i><b>"FEDERAL COURT UPHOLDS MOST OF YANKEE ROWE DEAL"</b><br>
BOSTON GLOBE ONLINE, 4/9/96,</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

The Yankee Atomic Electric Co. is entitled to recover all of its
investment in the Yankee Rowe nuclear power plant, a federal court
ruled on Tuesday.  The US Court of Appeals upheld most of a Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission ruling that allowed Yankee to recover
costs of construction, operation and closure from ratepayers.  The
FERC decision had been challenged by the town of Norwood, MA.

Yankee Rowe was shut down in 1991 due to safety concerns.  The costs
of decommissioning the plant are estimated at $368.3 million.

<i><b>"SUBSCRIBERS WON'T PAY FOR NUCLEAR SHUTDOWN AT NORTHEAST UTILITIES"</b><br>

Staff Report
<p>

Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities does not expect ratepayers to
help pay the costs of its nuclear-plant shutdowns and is instead
considering charges against earnings.  Northeast has said replacement
power may cost about $130 million before the three reactors at its
Millstone power plant are reopened.  The company earned $282.4 million
last year.  The reactors were idled recently by the utility and the US
Nuclear Regulatory Commission due to safety concerns.  In a letter to
state lawmakers, CEO Bernard Fox said NU wouldn't be able to recover
costs in areas where it "failed to meet industry standards."  Fox also
raised the prospect of NRC financial penalties that wouldn't be
recoverable in rates.  He said the CT Dept. of Public Utilities is
auditing NU's nuclear operations to determine which, if any, costs can
be passed on to ratepayers.

Rosalinda DeJesus
<p>

A state judge is now deciding how to appraise the value of the
Connecticut Yankee nuclear power plant, which is operated in the town
of Haddam by Northeast Utilities.  NU sued the town in 1992, saying it
was overassessed from 1991 to 1994.  "Since the case went to trial
this winter, both sides have acknowledged mistakes in their
assessments of the power plant."  The plant's value was originally
assessed by the town at $840 million, but NU insists the value is $235
million.  The town in 1995 revised its assessment to $423 million in a
move that caused local property tax revenues to plummet.

2007 and then shut down," the HARTFORD COURANT reports.

<i><b>"AN AGENCY THAT'S GOT TO GO"</b><br>
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 4/9/96, p. A19,</i><br>
Sen. Rod Grams (R-MN), Op-Ed
<p>

Almost 20 years after the US Dept. of Energy was created to deal with
a perceived energy crisis, the agency has become "a bureaucracy
without equal ... without a focused mission," writes Sen. Rod Grams
(R- MN), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Cmte.
For example, much of the agency's budget goes toward overseeing the
nation's nuclear waste.  But "unfortunately, the waste problem -- one
of the DOE's primary missions -- has become its primary failure,"
Grams writes.
<p>

Twenty-six nuclear power plants nationwide will run out of storage
space for spent nuclear fuel by 1998, the year DOE is required by law
to begin storing such wastes at an interim facility.  The DOE has had
14 years to prepare such a site but none has even been selected, "and
a permanent storage facility is no more than a pipe dream."
Meanwhile, electric ratepayers have paid $11 billion into a trust fund
for the permanent facility, with "little progress" to show for it.
<p>

Concerning the DOE's other missions, "we have little but pork" to show
for its alternative-energy research; energy conservation is less
important since oil, coal and natural gas reserves have all increased;
and energy imports are up.  And the agency is mired in management
problems.  "Americans are no longer willing to foot the bill for a
bloated, cumbersome agency that has outlived its usefulness," Grams
concludes.

<i><b>"NRC IS THREATENING TO REVOKE LICENSE FOR NORTHEAST UTILITIES' NUCLEAR REACTOR"</b><br>
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 4/8/96, p. A12B</i><br>
Ross Kerber
<p>

Northeast Utilities yesterday was required to prove to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission that its Connecticut Yankee plant in Haddam
Neck, CT is safe to operate.  "Otherwise, the agency may order that
plant off- line."
<p>

Northeast Utilities has been plagued with problems at a number of its
nuclear power plants around New England.  The NRC recently ordered
three reactors at its Waterford, CT-based Millstone nuclear power
station closed, pending a safety investigation.
<p>

Analysts say NU's nuclear "woes" could hurt the company financially.
Stephen Mahoney, pres. of the Boston-based energy and utilities
consulting company Devonrue Ltd.: "They've been spending at a heavy
clip on Millstone Units 1 and 2, and at this pace it's going to start
adding up."
<p>

NU officials estimate that the cost of replacement power could run as
high as $9 million per month.  But Dan Scotto, a utilities analyst at
New York-based Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said that the costs of replacement
power could be as much as $30 million to $50 million more than NU's
estimates.
<p>

       NEW YORK TIMES, 4/9/96, p. B2, George Judson.  The US Nuclear
       Regulatory Commission's "scrutiny" of Northeast Utilities'
       Millstone nuclear power plant has prompted Standard &amp; Poor's to
       put NU on the rating service's watch list.  Raymond Leung, an
       S&amp;P analyst, said the cost of replacement power and repairs to
       the Millstone reactors "is slowing the company's repayment of
       debt" and further unanticipated costs "could result in a credit
       downgrading."

<i><b>"UTILITIES STOCKS HIT HARD BY SURGE IN INTEREST RATES IN FIRST QUARTER"</b><br>
BALTIMORE SUN, 4/7/96, p. 5E</i><br>
New York Times News Service
<p>
     
"Hit by the same surge in interest rates that briefly sent the stock
market reeling," utility funds were among the "poorest- performing"
mutual funds in the first quarter of 1996.  Analysts fear that another
increase could further hurt the sector.  Utilities are sensitive to
changes in interest rates because they borrow heavily to finance their
operations, and "because their yields compete with bonds on yield."
<p>

Although utility funds finished the quarter "virtually where they
started in part due to other holdings that provided a buffer,
"disappointed" investors continue to pull money out of the funds.  And
"in a sign of just how out of favor the category is," the Dreyfus
Corp.  announced that it would liquidate its 5- year-old Edison
Electric Index Fund this month.
<p>

Standard &amp; Poor's Jane Collin: "This industry is changing rapidly,
and lots of opportunities are opening up for electric utilities, but
there's no question about it -- they still follow interest rates, and
when rates go up, stock prices fall."

MIAMI HERALD, 4/6/96, p. 8B</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

Florida Power &amp; Light is reorganizing its nuclear division.  The
move was prompted by "several mishaps" last year at its St. Lucie
nuclear plant.  FPL, the state's largest utility, is carrying out a
three-month review of its nuclear operations and estimates that as
many as 120 jobs could be eliminated.
<p>

Last November, FPL was fined $50,000 by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission for having "inoperable" equipment and failing to conduct
proper testing at its St. Lucie plant.  Last week the NRC fined the
utility another $50,000 for violating federal safety rules at St.
Lucie in January.

<i><b>"THE NUCLEAR STOCKPILE AMERICA NEEDS"</b><br>
NEW YORK TIMES, 4/5/96, p. A27</i><br>
Peter Crane, Op-ed
<p>

The stockpiling of potassium iodide -- "a cheap and effective drug
that protects the thyroid from exposure to radioactivity" -- is
"standard practice" in most industrial nations, but not the United
States, writes Peter Crane, a lawyer with the US Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.  After initially favoring creation of regional stockpiles,
the Federal Emergency Management Agency and NRC dropped the idea in
1985, saying stockpiles are not needed because nuclear accidents are
rare and thyroid disease is "easy" to treat.
<p>

In the latest chapter of the debate, the NRC in 1994 considered
whether to purchase stockpiles and distribute them to the states.
"But representatives of the nuclear power industry contended any
change in policy could affect 'public confidence in the technology.'"
The commission failed, on a 2-2 tie vote, to approve the new policy.
<p>

Noting the rash of thyroid cancer in children and adults near the
damaged Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine, Crane concludes: "If the day
ever comes that American children suffer" because of inaction on this
issue, "what will officials say to their parents?"

<i><b>"U.S. CITES 3D REACTOR FOR FLAWS IN ITS DESIGN"</b><br>
NEW YORK TIMES, 4/5/96, p. B6</i><br>
Matthew Wald
<p>

The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission said yesterday it had found
design flaws at the Millstone 3 nuclear power plant in Waterford, CT,
"less than a month after it ordered the other two Millstone plants to
stay shut until their safety could be assured."  The NRC "said the
problems were so serious that it had asked the plant's owner,
Northeast Utilities, to give it information to determine whether" the
plant's license should be revoked or modified.  All three plants were
put on the agency's "watch list" on January 31.
<p>

Millstone 3 is already off-line for "routine" maintenance, but the
commission's order "essentially prevents the utility from reopening
the plant until it addresses 'substantial questions'" about its
operations.
<p>

Company spokesman Anthony Castagno said, "We're really confident that
Millstone 3's analysis will move along more quickly than either
Millstone 1 or 2."  Castagno said the company could get along without
the three plants for a few weeks, "but that it could run into trouble"
by summer, when air conditioners begin to boost demand for
electricity. The plant's problems involve backup cooling pumps and
electronic devices that transmit information from the containment
building to the control room.

... An op-ed on nuclear power by Stanford Levin, a professor of
economics at Southern Illinois University and former commissioner of
the Illinois Commerce Commission, appears in this morning's JOURNAL OF
COMMERCE.  The essay, published first in the ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH

will be one of the least expensive sources of electricity" in the
competitive power market of the future.  A performance-based
regulatory system, as opposed to the current "prescriptive" approach,
would do even more to reduce costs, Levin writes (JOURNAL OF COMMERCE,

<i><b>"Palo Verde Fuel-Removal Try Set"</b><br>
JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, 4/3/96, p. 7B</i><br>
Walter Berry
<p>

Nuclear energy experts are trying to figure out how to remove a
1,500-pound uranium "fuel bundle" stuck in a reactor at the Palo Verde
Nuclear Generating Station without damaging one or more of its 236
fuel rods.

<p>

A damaged fuel rod could potentially release radioactive iodine,
krypton and xenon gas into the containment building and drop spent
uranium fuel pellets into the bottom of the reactor.  If such an
accident were to occur, it would require a costly cleanup that could
lead to an increase in electricity rates for the plant's four million
customers across four states.
<p>

The problem was discovered on March 22 when one of 241 fuel bundles
could not be lifted out of the reactor during a routine refueling
operation.  Six Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors and 50 plant
officials have been working round-the- clock on the problem since
Sunday.  The experts plan to use remote-controlled hydraulic jacks to
push up the bundle and lower a sling-like metal structure over it.  A
pair of hooks would then be used to secure and hoist the bundle.
<p>

Arizona Public Service Co. partly owns and operates the $9.3 billion
reactor, located 55 miles west of Phoenix.  Other stake- holders
include El Paso Electric Co., Southern California Edison and the
Public Service Co. of New Mexico.  SEE ALSO: "Nuclear Problem," USA

Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. said it is considering its

At Hope Creek, air vents that had been installed backward -- which in
an emergency could have allowed radioactive air to escape -- were
turned around, and the unit returned to full power on March 25.
<p>

All three plants "have been idled by various mechanical and safety
problems 32 times in the last three years."  Salem 1 has produced no
power since May 1995 and Salem 2 since June 1995.

Allegations that operators at Northeast Utilities' Millstone reactors
"skimped on safety to cut costs" are forcing local residents in
Waterford and East Lyme, CT to reexamine their comfort level
concerning nuclear power.
<p>

Confidence in the Millstone reactors remains high, but it is
increasingly "based on faith in the friends and neighbors who work"
there, rather than trust in Northeast Utilities or the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.  David Cini, First Selectman of East Lyme: "I
know people at Millstone, and I believe that the hundreds of people
who work there all want to be safe."
<p>

But safety questions have impacted local perceptions.  Waterford First
Selectman Tony Sheridan: "It's not a panic, but there is a concern
that wasn't here a year ago.  Most people are generous with their
trust, but once you lose it, it's lost."  For instance, the Citizens
Regulatory Commission, a local watchdog group, has already begun to
question the feasibility of evacuation plans and the plants'
protection from such disasters as earthquakes and hurricanes.

OMAHA WORLD-HERALD, 3/30/96, p. 13</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said on March 29 that it was looking
into further apparent safety violations discovered in February at the
Cooper Nuclear Station in Brownville, Nebraska.  One of the alleged
violations involves a "blowout panel" which is supposed to protect the
reactor containment building in case of a main steam-line rupture,
said NRC spokesman Mark Hammond.  In 1985, the blowout panels were
reinforced with fiberglass -- meant to stop air leaks -- but possibly
prevented the panels from working properly.
<p>

Noreen Thomas, spokeswoman for the Nebraska Public Power District,
which owns the plant, disagreed with the NRC, saying that the
equipment would have performed "as it was designed."
<p>

The station was shut down from April 1994 to early 1995 due to safety
violations involving the plant's emergency diesel generators.
However, the NRC last August issued a performance report indicating
that improvements at the plant had been made.

<i><b>"The Benefits of Nuclear Power"</b><br>
ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH, 4/1/96</i><br>
Stanford Levin, Op-Ed
<p>

The author, a professor of economics at Southern Illinois University
and former commissioner of the Illinois Commerce Commission, notes
that in the emerging competitive power market, "nuclear power will be
one of the least expensive sources of electricity."  And "as a nation,
we cannot afford to rule out any economic options for producing
electricity."
<p>

Levin reviews the cost competitiveness of nuclear versus coal and
renewable energy sources, and notes many plants are performing at
"remarkable" levels of output and efficiency.
<p>

An "important area for cost reduction is the regulatory process,"
Levin writes.  Current NRC regulations are overly prescriptive,
unprioritized and focused on "processes and procedures instead of
results."  In contrast, a performance-based system giving plant
operators "basic" requirements and flexibility in deciding how to meet
them, "promises substantial cost savings."
<p>

"Despite the continuing nuclear-waste disposal problem, which Congress
and the administration have so far not addressed,... we can make
progress with a pragmatic policy.  Economics, not ideology, should
guide our planning, Levin concludes.

Energy Sec'y Hazel O'Leary on March 29 told the House Appropriations
Energy and Water Subcommittee that the government will not know before
1998 whether it can safely store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in
Nevada.  This follows an earlier meeting between the House panel and
the Energy Dept.'s Daniel Dreyfus in which Dreyfus said that he is
confident Yucca Mountain will be found viable in 1998 as a nuclear
repository.
<p>

Subcommittee chairman Rep. John Myers (R-IN) "reminded O'Leary that
Congress has a responsibility to nuclear power utilities 'that you
once represented' to take possession of the waste by 1998."  O'Leary
responded, saying it would be shortsighted to move legislation for an
interim storage facility before the Energy Dept. makes its finding in
1998.  "Such a move might answer the needs of a few utilities that
have run out of storage space, she said, but it would risk the
development of a permanent repository for all utilities."

<i><b>"NRC Charges Maine Yankee With Three Safety Violations"</b><br>
BOSTON GLOBE ONLINE, 4/2/96</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

Officials at the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in Wiscasset, ME are
"focusing on improving employee safety" since the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission charged them with three violations last month.  Radioactive
gas was released on February 29, exposing 16 workers to radiation
"well below federal limits." But the accident was "another failure" of
personnel to follow prescribed work methods, the NRC said.
<p>

A Maine Yankee spokeswoman said a new job-hazard training program is
underway at the plant, and an employee review board has been convened
to seek other ways to improve safety measures. Plant officials will
report to NRC staff at a meeting in Philadelphia on April 25.

<i><b>"High Hanford Radiation Exposure Cut"</b><br>
SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER, 3/29/96, p. C10</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

Relatively high levels of radiation exposure have decreased 670ver
three years at the Washington Public Power Supply System, due in part
to a shift in the way "hot spots" at the plant's No. 2 reactor are
cleaned, according to plant radiation protection manager John Albers.
In 1993, plant workers received a monthly average of 21.5 rems of
radiation.  Early this year, that figure was down to 7.3 rems.
<p>

WPPSS improved the exposure problem by having employees cast lead
shields to fit around leaking pipes and valves, cutting down their
radiation exposure time.  No worker's health was threatened by the
exposure levels, but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission saw it as a
sign of a "sloppily run" plant.  "Now, worker exposure is taken into
account when decisions are made as to what will be cleaned and what
will be left alone."

The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission last week dismissed allegations
that Entergy Operations Inc. retaliated against an employee
"whistle-blower" working at the River Bend nuclear power plant in
Louisiana.  The decision by the NRC's regional office runs counter to
conclusions of the NRC's Office of Investigation announced in December
1995.  NRC regional administrator L.J. Callan said that the staff
reached their decision after consulting with the director of the
Office of Investigation.
<p>

The NRC's initial concern was that the employee's job performance
ranking was inconsistent with earlier evaluations.  However, EOI
representatives met with NRC regional officials in February to present
their case, and convinced the NRC staff that the company would have
taken the same action against the employee even if he had not raised
safety concerns.

<i><b>"Plutonium Eyed for Power Plants"</b><br>

Jeff Sallot
<p>

"The Canadian government is backing a plan to use plutonium from
surplus warheads as a fuel in nuclear power reactors," according to
federal sources.  Prime Minister Jean Chretien will politically
support the proposal later this month when he meets with US President
Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and others at a nuclear
safety summit in Moscow, "senior government sources" said.
<p>

No final decisions are expected at the summit.  Many plans to use
plutonium -- including one to use Ontario Hydro's Bruce A reactor --
face several political struggles in Canada and abroad.
<p>

The "ailing" nuclear industry in Canada "strongly supports" the
proposal, believing that it would showcase their technology. If the
plan is approved, several reactors could receive a much- needed boost,
including the Bruce A reactor, which has not been in use because
Ontario Hydro has excess generating capacity.

<i><b>"Austin Ends Testimony in Nuke Trial With Expert" </b><br>
AUSTIN AMERICAN-STATESMAN, 3/26/96, p. B6</i><br>
Matt Schwartz
<p>

The city of Austin, TX on March 25 rested its case against Houston
Lighting &amp; Power with the testimony of Bart Withers, a former
manager of the Wolf Creek nuclear power plant and former head of the
Institute of Nuclear Power Operations.  The city is suing HL&amp;P for
negligence, charging the utility's mismanagement of its South Texas
Project nuclear plant led to a 14-month shutdown in 1993 and costs to
Austin totaling $120 million.
<p>

Basing his claims on documents from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
HL&amp;P, and INPO, Withers testified that HL&amp;P had mismanaged the
South Texas Project in 1990, 1991 and 1992, and that it "repeatedly
failed to fix things it had promised to correct."
<p>

HL&amp;P lawyer David Beck accused Withers himself of mismanaging the
Wolf Creek plant he once worked for, citing NRC ratings for Wolf Creek
below those of HL&amp;P.  Withers admitted under questioning that NRC
reports tend to focus on problems rather than compliments, and that
selectively chosen INPO standards could indict "even a well-run
plant."
<p>

But Withers later pointed to HL&amp;P documents in which managers 
state that the utility must repair its reputation with the NRC.

<i><b>"Conflicts Flare Up Amid Rush to Adjourn; Dispute Over Money Ties Up Bill to Solve Nuclear Waste Issue"</b><br>
MINNEAPOLIS STAR-TRIBUNE, 3/27/96, p. B1</i><br>
Robert Whereatt
<p>

A proposal in the Minnesota legislature to halt the search for a new
nuclear-waste disposal site and compensate Indians living next to the
existing site "melted down" on Tuesday after lawmakers decided to
force Northern States Power Co. to foot $10 million of the total cost.
<p>

Under a previous agreement, NSP had agreed to pay the Prairie Island
Dakota tribe $2 million as compensation for living next to an
above-ground storage site for spent nuclear fuel. Sen. Steven Novak
(D), the bill sponsor, then proposed having the state contribute $8
million. But after some lawmakers questioned why the state should pick
up the larger share of the costs, the language was changed to require
a $10 million contribution from NSP, leading NSP Vice President Tom
Micheletti to say: "The package now does not make any sense to
us."
<p>

In response to the controversy, Senate Enviroment Committee Chairman
Bob Lessard (D) said he will not raise the issue again in the
session's final days, "dashing hopes that this emotional environmental
issue will be resolved this year."  Novak said the proposal was "all
but dead."  A 1994 mandate requiring the state and NSP to locate an
alternative site will remain on the books.

<p>

Colorado's Public Service Co., the state's largest gas and electric
utility, announced on March 22 that it is the first utility in the
nation to physically decommission a long-term operating, commercial-
sized nuclear power plant.  Most of the removal of low-level
radioactive material was completed in February, and the final release
survey should be completed in August, allowing the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission to release PSC from its nuclear operating license by the
end of the year.
<p>

PSC's vice president, A. Clegg Crawford: "This marks a significant
milestone, not just for Public Service Co. of Colorado, but for the
entire nuclear industry.  We have shown the world that a nuclear power
plant can be successfully decommissioned, both from a technical and
financial standpoint."
<p>

The Fort St. Vrain plant will be repowered to use natural gas and will
generate electricity beginning in May.  PSC spokesman Mark Stutz said
that the company may be able to serve as a consultant or technical
expert to some 119 other nuclear reactors that face shutdown in the
next decade or two.

<i><b>"Plan for Prairie Island Plant Draws Criticism"</b><br>
MINNEAPOLIS STAR-TRIBUNE, 3/23/96</i><br>
Robert Whereatt
<p>

A proposal to put $8 million in state money into a compensation fund
for the Indian tribe living adjacent to Northern States Power Co.'s
Prairie Island nuclear plant was questioned last week by Minnesota
lawmakers.
<p>

Under a previously reached agreement, NSP would contribute $2 million,
and local governments in Goodhue County would transfer some Prairie
Island tax revenues, to the Mdewankton Sioux tribe.  In return, NSP
could drop its search for an off- site repository for 17 casks of
nuclear wastes.  But the latest plan, sponsored by State Sen.  Steven
Novak (D), calls for $8 million from the state treasury as well.
<p>

The tribe says the money would compensate some members who want to
move away from the site.  But members of the state Senate Environment
and Natural Resources Committee called the plan "ransom" and
questioned why NSP is not being asked to chip in more.  In response to
concerns from some that land and money in the compensation package
would be used to build a new casino, a tribal spokesman denied that
was being considered.
<p>

With only a few days left in the legislative session, "and with the
governor opposing a state appropriation," observers on both sides were
not optimistic the latest proposal would be passed.

<i><b>"Former Federal Regulators on NU Payroll"</b><br>

Northeast Utilities has "tapped" several former federal regulators to
help the company as it "grapple's" with problems at its nuclear
plants."  Most recently, former US Nuclear Regulatory Commission
member E. Gail DePlanque was asked to join NU's board. NU Chairman
Bernard Fox said that DePlanque was hired because the company wanted
another nuclear energy expert.  Other ex-regulators who have been
hired by NU include: -- Thomas Murley, a retired NRC director of
nuclear reactor regulation.  Murley was paid $63,000 in 1994 for
"outside services," and works as a consultant for other utilities;
<ul>
  <li> James Partlow, a retired NRC director of reactor inspection and
       safeguards.  Partlow was hired to investigate safety concerns
       raised by a Millstone power station whistleblower.  Partlow
       died in 1995; and
       <p>

  <li> James Curtiss, a retired NRC commissioner.  The Washington-

<i><b>"Bill Seeks Choice of Power Provider"</b><br>
CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER, 3/22/96, C1</i><br>
Vindu Goel
<p>

Ohio state Rep. Ronald Amstutz introduced a bill on 3/21 to allow Ohio
consumers, who pay some of the highest electric rates in the nation,
to choose their electricity supplier.  About a dozen key lawmakers
have co-sponsored the bill.  But Amstutz does not expect the bill to
pass this session.
<p>

"Essentially, the bill would repeal the exclusive rights electric
utilities such as Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. and Ohio Edison
now have to serve a particular area."  The hope is that companies will
be forced to compete for customers and thus lower their prices.
<p>

Obstacles to the deregulation process include the state property- tax
system, which supports schools through electricity taxes, and possible
stranded costs from several multibillion- dollar nuclear-power
investments made by some companies.

<i><b>"In Tenn., Latest Nuclear Power Plant Epitomizes Industry's Rise and Fall"</b><br>
PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 3/24/96, p. A3</i><br>
Jeffrey Fleishman
<p>

The story of the Watts Bar power plant "is the story of the nuclear
industry."  After 23 years of troubles, the Tennessee Valley
Authority's Watts Bar nuclear reactor, the nation's last nuclear
plant, this spring will begin operating at full speed. But the plant
still faces attacks from employees and scientists "who contend the
plant is too dangerous to open."
<p>

Critics say that with the construction costs of Watts Bar adding up to
$6.8 billion -- 1,600% the original estimation of $370 million -- the
plant will never compensate for its overruns. TVA, which has been a
mainstay for the nuclear industry, faces a threatened future because
of the tremendous debts it has created investing in nuclear projects.
And scientists and economists argue that it is TVA's ratepayers who
will pay for investments like the Watts Bar.

"The National Labor Relations Board has lodged a complaint against
Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co. and intends to hold a hearing" on
charges brought by the union attempting to organize BGE's employees.
The action responds to the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers' claims that BGE is "harassing" employees engaged in union
activities at its nuclear power plants.  Some employees were "fired,
demoted or feared company reprisals" for being involved in union
organizing, according to the union.
<p>

Kathleen Nolan, a BGE spokeswoman, said the utility "welcomes" the
hearing.  Nolan: "We don't believe there is any merit to these
charges. This is a common union tactic, and we're not going to be
intimidated by it."
<p>

The new developments "mark the latest in heightening tensions between
the utility and the union," which also represents 2,700 employees of
Potomac Electric Power Co., with whom BGE plans to merge.  BGE has
always been nonunion and "hopes employees will reject union

Last spring, company officials discovered extensive cracks in the
plant's stem generator tubes, requiring a shutdown and a "massive,"

<i><b>"Utilities Deregulation Would Be a Bigger Ripoff Than the S&amp;Ls"</b><br>
MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE, 3/21/96, p. A22</i><br>
Molly Ivins
<p>

Nationally syndicated columnist Molly Ivins criticized Sen. J.
Bennett Johnston's (D-LA) bill to "preempt state experiments in
utility deregulation."  She wrote that although some states
wish to pursue wholesale competition in the electric industry, the
Johnston bill would require all states to opt for retail competition,
which is what big industrial power users such as Dow Chemical or
General Motors want. "They want to be able to go around the utilities
and directly to generators of electricity and cut themselves the best
deal they can."
<p>

Ivins also criticized the Johnston bill for allowing utilities to
recover 1000f their stranded assets.  Companies that invested in
costly projects such as the South Texas Nuclear Project would "get to
project stranded costs out over the entire projected life of
the plant and get paid for that too. Presto!  The largest public
bailout of a private industry in history."
<p>

Matthew Freedman of the Public Citizen consumer organization Critical
Mass Energy Project, contemplated the scope of "this rip-off," saying:
"It is just major.  Major.  Major."

<i><b>"Panel Finds No Reason to Rush Storage Site Construction"</b><br>
S.F. EXAMINER/CHRONICLE Online, 3/20/96</i><br>
H. Josef Herbert, Associated Press
<p>

There is no scientific or safety reason to immediately build a
centralized spent-nuclear-fuel storage facility, the Nuclear Waste
Technical Review Board said on Wednesday.  The 11-member board,
created by Congress in 1987 to advise lawmakers and the Energy
Department on nuclear waste issues, said there likely will not be a
"serious crunch" for centralized storage until 2010, when reactors are
expected to begin shutting down in high numbers.
<p>

The board's report said the government should concentrate on
determining the suitability of the Yucca Mountain, NV site for a
permanent underground waste repository and then consider building a
temporary storage facility to serve interim needs.  Many nuclear plan
operators say they're running out of storage space for waste, but the
report "concluded that the situation is not nearly as urgent as the
nuclear industry suggests."
<p>

The nuclear industry criticized the board's findings and said the
panel had "strayed from its mandate" of providing scientific
evaluations and improperly was "becoming an advocate of policy instead
a defender of science."  Scott Northard of Northern States Power Co.
said a large- scale central facility for spent fuel needs to be
available "as soon as possible" to avoid some nuclear plants being
forced to shut down ahead of schedule.

<i><b>"Low-Level Nuclear Waste Facility Safe, Say Experts"</b><br>
ASBURY PARK NJ PRESS, 3/19/96</i><br>
Neil A. Sheehan
<p>

A low-level radioactive waste storage facility proposed for New Jersey
would pose "no more of a health risk than calling the Rocky Mountains
home," according to Arthur Upton, a professor of environmental and
community medicine at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New
Jersey.  Upton's remarks came Monday at a conference sponsored by the
League of Women Voters, the League of Municipalities and Rutgers
University.
<p>

He said that residents near the facility would receive an added dose
of 25 millirems a year, which he said was an "acceptable risk."  But
people living in the Rockies already receive that much more from the
cosmic radiation from living at a higher elevation.
<p>

For the past year and a half, New Jersey has been trying to "entice" a
town into hosting a $100 million facility for storing the 17
tractor-trailer loads of low-level waste produced each year in the
state.  The state is willing to offer up to $3 million a year, plus
"several other incentives," but so far response has been "tepid."  New
Jersey currently exports its waste to Barnwell County, SC.

<p>

Northeast Utilities this week will begin cleaning up a radioactive-
waste storage area at its Millstone 1 nuclear power plant.  The
company the cleanup will exceed federal standards by installing a new
processing system that will reduce the plant's liquid radioactive
waste by two- thirds, according to Deborah Beauchamp, a company
spokeswoman.
<p>

Last week NU disclosed that rusting pipes in the plant have been
neglected for 10 or 15 years, and that several holding tanks were
leaking about 1.5 quarts a day of radioactive waste.  The federal
Nuclear Regulatory Commission is investigating, and the company
expects to be fined.

<p>

Idaho Democratic candidate Walt Minnick, who is seeking the US Senate
seat held by Republican Larry Craig, on March 13 said Congress should
make a new mission for the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory by
using it to pursue a new generation of nuclear power plants.
<p>

Minnick, the former CEO of the giant wood-products company TJ
International, suggested the Energy Dept. have INEL' nuclear
scientists develop a new reactor.  Minnick said he believes that
natural resources are finite and that nuclear energy is the best
alternative for cheap power.  While Minnick said he would push for a
nuclear energy project at INEL if elected to the Senate, he has
previously come out strongly against the storage of nuclear waste at
the site and has criticized ID Gov. Phil Batt's (R) agreement with the
DOE to store waste there.

<i><b>"Industry Funds Global-Warming Skeptics"</b><br>
WASHINGTON POST, 3/20/96, p. A8</i><br>
Gary Lee
<p>

The Washington, DC-based environmental group Ozone Action yesterday
charged that three researchers who are "outspoken critics" of the
scientific evidence that suggests that global warming is occurring
have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the petroleum and
coal industries.  one of the scientists also receives regular funding
from the oil-rich government of Kuwait.
<p>

The researchers -- Arizona State University's Robert Balling,
University of Virginia's Patrick Michaels and Sherwood Idso of
Phoenix, AZ -- are frequently called to testify before congressional
panels and other public groups.  They have publicly asserted that if
global warming is occurring, it is caused by natural factors, not
human activity as many believe.

<center><h3>HOW MUCH AND FROM WHO?</h3></center>

Balling reportedly received up to $311,000 from the oil and coal
industries, as well as the Kuwaiti government.  A large portion of his
funding came from AZ-based Cyprus Minerals Co., an organization of
various petroleum and coal companies.  UVA's Michaels received about
$150,000 from such interests, including the Western Fuels Assn., "an
umbrella industry organization." Both men were invited two weeks ago
the "make their case" the House Science Committee, which wants to cut
federal funding for climate change research by 40%.
<p>

Idso, a physicist who works closely with Balling, "has received an
undisclosed amount of funding from oil, gas and utility sources,
according to Ozone Action."

<i><b>"Was Therapy Used to Punish Nuclear Workers"</b><br>
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 3/20/96, p. B1</i><br>
Ross Kerber
<p>

"In a growing number of instances, nuclear workers say they are being
pressured to undergo psychological evaluations after raising safety
concerns," reports the WALL STREET JOURNAL.  In a growing number of
cases, workers get normal performance reviews "until they start
raising concerns.  "And management needs a way to discredit them,"
says Lynne Bernabei, a Washington attorney who has represented workers
in several harassment cases.
<p>

Psychological testing of nuclear-plant workers has become routine in
1990 and 1992 when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission instituted new
rules to address drug abuse and other behavioral problems.  They
required plant operators to monitor employees closely and offer
assistance programs when needed.
<p>

<center><b>CASES IN QUESTION</b></center>
<p>

Glenda Kay Miller, a security engineer at the Tennessee Valley
Authority's Browns Ferry nuclear plant, filed a complaint with the US
Labor Dept.  She was sent to company psychologists for questioning the
reliability of a proposed employee- identification system and last
August was fired on the grounds that she was unfit for duty.
<p>

Elsewhere, Labor Secretary Robert Rieich in January ordered Florida
Power &amp; Light Co. to rehire engineer Richard Robainas who said he
was fired after refusing to undergo a psychological evaluation.
Robainas had questioned the reliability of reactor pressure-monitoring
equipment at FPL's Turkey Point plant.  And the NRC is currently
investigating allegations that Northeast Utilities has routinely
harassed workers criticizing safety procedures, including sending them
to therapy and counseling. Robainas: "In certain societies, psychiatry
is used to curb dissent.  I think that's what is occurring here."
<p>

<center><b>CAN ANYTHING BE DONE?</b></center>
<p>

NRC officials say they are aware of allegations that utilities are
using the rules to harass whistle-blowers, but says it is difficult to
prove.  Officials also say that their top priority is investigating
the safety concerns raised; "accusations of improper referrals to
psychologists take less precedence."

The Energy Dept. and West Valley Nuclear Service Co., a Westinghouse
subsidiary, planned to release on March 19 a draft environmental
impact statement on the cleanup of the 200-acre West Valley
Demonstration Project in New York.  The document is based on 40
volumes of data collected since 1980 and compiled by Reston, VA-based

The environmental study was initiated when members of the West Valley
Coalition, a "citizens group," went to federal court and got the
government and Nuclear Service Co., the prime contractor in the
cleanup, to agree to do the study.  The West Valley properties are
jointly owned by DOE and the NY State Energy Research and Development
Authority.  The study looks at options for cleaning up the facilities
left behind when the former Nuclear Fuels Services Co. "abandoned" its
commercial fuel reprocessing business, leaving "600,000 gallons of
radioactive waste and radioactive buildings and ground."
<p>

Alternatives spelled out in the study range from doing nothing to
"scooping up the entire area and hauling the materials away."

<i><b>"EIA:  Less Nuclear Power, Lower Fuel Prices"</b><br>
ELECTRIC PERSPECTIVES, 3-4/96, p. 5</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

Nuclear power generation will decrease 32% by 2015 and fuel prices
will drop less sharply than previously predicted, according to the
Energy Information Administration's "Annual Energy Outlook 1996.
<p>

EIA's forecast assumes that about 400f the current nuclear
generation capacity will retire by 3015 as plants reach the end of
their 40-year operating life.  The resulting 32-percent reduction in
the use of nuclear power between 1994 and 2015 was not evident in
earlier projections, as most of the retirements would occur after the
previous forecast horizon of 2010.  EIA predicts that coal and natural
gas use will rise to increase to fill the gap and meet expanding
electricity demand.
<p>

The group expects lower prices for natural gas and coal than in prior
forecasts, mostly because of higher resource estimates, technology
improvements and productivity gains.

Curtis Campbell Sr., Op-Ed
<p>

Curtis Campbell Sr., chairman of the Prairie Island Indian Community,
writes that "time may run out" on Minnesota's 1996 legislative session
before the "serious problem" of nuclear waste storage at Northern
States Power's Prairie Island nuclear power plant is solved.  His
tribe is supporting a bill that would provide "fair compensation" to
the tribe and end NSP's search for an "alternative storage site" in
Goodhue County, MN.
<p>

Though NSP ratepayers have paid more than $240 million for developing
a federal storage site, the waste remains at Prairie Island. Taxpayers
could pay as much as $64 million to move the waste to an alternative
site -- a process that "even state lawmakers are calling a joke."
<p>

The state Environmental Quality Board wants to end the search for new
sites and leave the waste at Prairie Island.  But Campbell says that,
without an agreement with NSP, his tribe will not allow that to happen
and will take legal action if necessary.

<i><b>"Fired Reactor Workers Say They Prevented Disaster"</b><br>
ST. PETERSBURG TIMES, 3/14/96, p. 1B</i><br>
Ian James
<p>

Control-room workers at Florida Power Corp.'s Crystal River nuclear
plant found a problem in a main safety system in September 1994 that
they say could have "led to a disaster."  The company promptly
corrected the problem but, according to the workers, "wasn't exactly
grateful."
<p>

Last August the company disciplined six employees who worked that
shift, charging that they "performed unauthorized tests." Two
supervisors were fired, and four workers were reprimanded or "stripped
of their nuclear operators' licenses."
<p>

Former shift supervisor David Fields, who was fired, and two other
workers filed a complaint with the US Labor Dept. last month with
claimed they had performed a "routine procedure" and were being
"penalized for identifying the problem."  Florida Power declined
comment because the Labor Dept. and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
are investigating the issue.
<p>

According to workers, the problem began in April 1993, when plant
managers ordered them to add more hydrogen to a main safety system.
The workers "worried" that adding to much hydrogen could burn up a
crucial pump and, if backup systems were down, could leave the reactor
core exposed.  So they decided to "see for themselves" with a
procedure they called "safe and routine."  The company said that
though public safety had not been at risk, the operators had
intentionally subjected safety equipment to high pressure levels that
made alarms go off.

<i><b>"Anger Is Main Reaction at Hearing on NU's Troubled Nuclear Power Plants"</b><br>
HARTFORD COURANT, 3/14/96, p. A21</i><br>
Barbara A. Nagy
<p>

Most of the 125 people who showed up for last Wednesday's hearing on
Northeast Utilities' "troubled" reactors were there "because they were
angry."  One woman "near tears" said, "This is terrifying.  We live in
these communities."
<p>

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission held the hearing because of concerns
about NU's three-unit Millstone nuclear plant.  The commission put
Millstone on its "watch list" on January 31 because of the plant's
eight-year history of "safety and management problems" -- problems
that "culminated" last year when a Millstone engineer told the NRC
that Unit 1 had not been refueled according to procedures for 20
years.
<p>

The NRC requires "substantial progress" before removing the plant from
the list, a process that "usually" takes two or three years.  But Bob
Rutter of Hartford said, "This kind of company and this kind of fox

<i><b>"TMI Cited for Two Violations"</b><br>
YORK PA DAILY RECORD, 3/14/96, p. A2</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued two citations to GPU
Nuclear, which operates the Three Mile Island nuclear plant.  The
first violation concerned GPU's failure to modify some pipe supports
that its own engineers recommended in 1990. The other was for
miscalculating the pipe stress and "failing to establish through
analysis the adequacy of the pipe supports."

<i><b>"Senate Plan Targets Nevada Test Site; A Proposal to Keep
Nuclear Waste on an Interim Basis in Nevada Ignores Out-of- State
Alternatives"</b><br>
LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL, 3/13/96, p. 1A</i><br>
Tony Batt
<p>

The Senate is "following the lead of the House" with legislation that
"targets" the Nevada Test Site for interim storage of nuclear waste
and eliminates other possibilities, reports the LAS VEGAS REVIEW-
JOURNAL.  The bill was expected to "pass easily" on Wednesday because
one of its authors is panel chairman Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-AK).
<p>

The Senate bill, introduced by Sen. Larry Craig (R-ID), "mirrors" a
bill introduced in the House by Rep. Fred Upton (R- MI).  Upton's bill
is "stalled" because lawmakers have "balked" at removing federal
budget restrictions for temporary storage and permanent disposal.  The
Senate bill would maintain budget restrictions, but shift the priority
to storage.
<p>

The Senate bill also calls for shipping the waste across Nevada in
"heavy-haul trucks," while the House bills calls for building a
railroad.  The House bill requires DOE to begin storage by January 31,
1998.  The Senate bill directs DOE to take title to the waste by 1998,
but gives DOE until January 31, 1999, to begin storage at the test
site.

ATLANTA JOURNAL/CONSTITUTION, 3/14/96, p. A10</i><br>
Andrew J. Glass
<p>

While Congress is prepared to spend billion for a new missile system,
it is "balking" at spending far smaller sums in the former Soviet
Union to deny nuclear weapons to "rogue countries and terrorists,"
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-GA) said Wednesday.
<p>

Nunn spoke in response to a General Accounting Office report that
linked lax controls over former Soviet weapons to seven nuclear thefts
and the threat of a nuclear black market.  Though the report found no
"direct evidence" of such a market, it did find "poor security at many
storage sites for weapons-grade plutonium and enriched uranium."
<p>

Congress has voted to spend $1.8 billion over the last five years to
help dismantle Soviet weapons and safeguard materials, and a "quasi-
private program" has been set up to buy uranium for reprocessing in US
plants.

<p>

Russia plans to put a floating nuclear power plant into operation in
the Far East in five years, according to Alexander Polushkin, head of
the Malaya Energetika company.  The plant will consist of two small
reactors aboard a barge in the East Siberian Sea.  The reactors will
be delivered ready to operate, but every 13 years must be towed about
2,500 miles -- one way -- for repair and refueling.  "Russia's nuclear
power industry has raised safety concerns in the United States and
other countries."

<p>

Understanding ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) antenna
interaction with the edge/scrape-off-layer (SOL) plasma is crucial to
building antennas that can survive long-pulse or steady-state
high-power operation in plasmas. The global effects of ICRF/edge
interactions are discussed. The present knowledge of ICRF-induced
sheath interactions with the edge and SOL plasmas in magnetic fusion
experiments is quantitatively reviewed and added to. The design
principles and equations governing plasma heat loading and the
sputtering of Faraday shields and the bumper limiters of ICRF antennas
for long-pulse and steady-state devices are presented. Electrostatic
sheaths on Faraday shields and bumper limiters are discussed, and an
analytic estimate of the induced direct-current (dc) plasma potential
at the lateral protection (bumper limiters) of ICRF antennas is
given. This is a new result. This estimated dc voltage is used to give
the total power flow to the lateral protection, and an expression for
the power flux is given--also with new results. Equations to use in
estimating impurity production (sputtering) and principles for
minimizing impurity production are reviewed. Similar equations and
estimates for electromotive radio-frequency sheaths are given, and new
scaling laws for the dc voltage and power flow to the ICRF antenna
lateral protection due to electromotive sheaths are proposed. The
initial results from the ICRF/edge interaction experiments on Tore
Supra are presented and discussed in light of the theoretical and
heuristic results given.

<a name=1><b>Stellarator-Tokamak Hybrid with Inclined Coils</b><br></a>
<i>Paul E. Moroz</i>
<p>

A new type of device for plasma confinement that can be categorized as
a stellarator-tokamak hybrid is proposed. This device features two
systems of coils: the standard toroidal field coils of a tokamak and
an additional system of simple coils to produce stellarator-like
effects. A system of vertically inclined planar coils is used for
numerical calculations, although other possible engineering solutions
can be found. The system of poloidal field coils is required to
compensate for the vertical magnetic field induced by the inclined
coils. The possible modernization of a tokamak into such a hybrid is
outlined. (The Phaedrus-T tokamak of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison is kept in mind in the examples considered.) Because
of the availability of two separate coil sets, the device considered
is able to operate as a pure stellarator, as a pure tokamak, or as
their hybrid when both coil systems are powered. The main unique
features and regimes of operation would be expected to include smooth
transition from th e pure tokamak regime to the pure stellarator
regime and back and to possibly operate the device in an
alternating-current regime. Devices of this type combine the
attractive properties of both tokamaks and stellarators. They feature
inductive current, which is efficient for plasma heating and/or
current drive, and good plasma confinement, typical of tokamaks. At
the same time, they feature the prolonged or continuous plasma
discharge operation typical of stellarators.

<a name=2><b>Design Analysis to Reduce the Equivalent Dose Rate of the Neutral Beam Injection System in a Fusion Experimental Reactor</b><br></a>
<i>Kei-ichiro Shibata, Koichi Maki, Michio Otsuka, Takashi Inoue</i>
<p>

As applied to the common design of the neutral beam injection (NBI)
system in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)
Conceptual Design Activity, a design is proposed and examined that
reduces the equivalent dose rate of the NBI system in order to enable
access to the outside of the injector. Modifying the current system is
necessary because the equivalent dose rate in the NBI room after
reactor shutdown is higher than the design limit for radiation
workers. The NBI maintenance concept is based on full-remote
maintenance. There are, however, some problems that must be solved
before full-remote maintenance could be realized--such as connection
and disconnection of the electric power cables and complicated coolant
pipes, and location of the maintenance equipment--this concept solves
the aforementioned problem by enabling worker accessibility to the
outside of the injector. The following design points are suggested to
reduce the equivalent dose rate.
<p>

The vacuum vessel should be composed of aluminum to reduce the induced
radioactivity. Polyethylene, which has high shielding ability for
neutrons, should be installed between the vessel and magnetic shield
located outside the vacuum vessel to reduce not only neutron flux
coming to the magnetic shield but also gamma-ray flux, caused by
in-vessel components, leaking to the NBI room. The equivalent dose
rate in the NBI room 1 week after reactor shutdown can be reduced to
28 <img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif">Sv/h by applying the
foregoing measures. Thus, the prospect exists for realizing access to
the outside of the injector.  <p>


<a name=3><b>Calculations of Neutron Activation Response for the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor and Absolute Calibrations of Neutron Yield</b><br></a>
<i>Cris W. Barnes, Alvin R. Larson, A. L. Roquemore</i>
<p>

The most accurate determination of neutron yields from fusion reactors
may be obtained from neutron activation measurements of elemental
foils. On the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR), a re-entrant
irradiation end has been installed to provide a low-scattering
environment close to the plasma for neutron activation
measurements. The ratio of energy-dependent fluence to total fusion
yield is calculated using a fully three-dimensional Monte Carlo
calculation with the Monte Carlo code for neutron and photon transport
(MCNP). Corrections to the ``virgin'' fluence from attenuation and
scattering are only 10 to 20 0.000000or deuterium-tritium (D-T) reactions
and 30 to 40 0.000000or deuterium-deuterium reactions. A total 1-sigma
accuracy of +-8 134672392s achieved for D-T neutron yields over a wide
dynamic range. This paper documents the response coefficients (hits
per source neutron, where hits are activated nuclei per target nuclei)
for use by the neutron activation system on TFTR; describes the
possible systematic corrections nee ded (such as major radial
variations or the impact of ion temperature on reactions with
high-energy thresholds); and estimates uncertainties in the response
coefficients. Results from in situ use of a D-T neutron generator are
also analyzed using the MCNP modeling as an approximate benchmarking
experiment; only 20% accuracy in the comparison is possible because of
poor counting statistics in the calibration experiment.
<p>


<a name=4><b>Membrane Support of Accelerated Fuel Capsules for Inertial Fusion Energy</b><br></a>
<i>Ronald W. Petzoldt, Ralph W. Moir</i>
<p>

The use of thin membranes to suspend an inertial fusion energy fuel
capsule in a holder or hohlraum for injection into a reaction chamber
is investigated. Also discussed is the stress that occurs in the fuel
within a capsule during acceleration. To determine the maximum target
acceleration, capsule displacement and membrane deformation angle are
calculated for an axisymmetric geometry for a range of membrane strain
and capsule size. Membranes must be thin (perhaps &lt;1 <img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif">m) to minimize their effect on capsule
implosion symmetry. Typical target injection scenarios prefer
accelerations in excess of 1000 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Acceleration in
excess of 1600 m/s<sup>2</sup> for a 2.4-mm-radius 30-mg capsule is
possible with two 0.1-<img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif">m-thick membranes. Added stress from
vibrations could cause a factor of 2 decrease in the allowed
acceleration unless the acceleration profile is modified to mitigate
this effect. However, if the acceleration is gradually increased and
then decreased, over a few membrane oscillation perio ds (i.e., a few
milliseconds), the membrane stress due to oscillation overshoot and
the final capsule oscillation amplitude is minimal. Compared with a
single membrane, a dual membrane geometry allows several times greater
acceleration with reduced capsule displacement.  <p>


<a name=5><b>High-Resolution Optical Measurements of Surface Roughness for Beta-Layered Deuterium-Tritium Solid Inside a Re-Entrant Copper Cylinder</b><br></a>
<i>John D. Sheliak, James K. Hoffer, Larry R. Foreman, Evan R. Mapoles</i>
<p>

A high-resolution optical imaging system and custom-designed image
analysis software are used to make surface roughness measurements for
deuterium-tritium (D-T) solid layers, equilibrated inside a
2-mm-inside-diameter re-entrant copper cylinder. Several experiments
are performed that yield D-T layer thicknesses of between 75 and 139
<img alt="" src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif">m, with equilibration
temperatures between 17.4 and 18.8 K. A 1024- x 1024-pixel
charge-coupled-device imaging camera, coupled with a
Maksutov-Cassegrain long-range microscope, produces a 2.5-<img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif">m (single-pixel) image resolution. The
error function fitting of the image analysis data produces submicron
resolution of the layer interior surface finish. The length scale for
the cylinder inner bore is just over 6 mm, and the final layer surface
roughness for this length ranges from 3- to 1.7-<img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif">m root-mean-square. The feasibility is
being explored of using these highly uniform and smooth D-T solid
layers inside future targets for inertial confinement fusion reactors
to produce s urface finishes that will meet target design requirements
for the National Ignition Facility. Techniques for improving the D-T
solid layer surface finish are examined, limitations of the current
D-T cell configuration and fuel mix are discussed, and cell
configurations for future experiments are described.  <p>


<a name=6><b>Comprehensive Safety Analysis Code System for Nuclear Fusion Reactors IV: Preliminary Estimation of Dust Production Due to Plasma Disruptions</b><br></a>
<i>Takuro Honda, Takashi Okazaki, Yasushi Seki, Isao Aoki, Tomoaki Kunugi</i>
<p>

Dust production due to plasma disruptions has been investigated using
a safety analysis code, which can calculate the plasma dynamics and
thermal characteristics of fusion reactor structures
simultaneously. We selected two fusion reactor designs in the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), i.e., the
Engineering Design Activity (EDA) and the Conceptual Design Activity
(CDA). The ITER/EDA will adopt beryllium for the plasma-facing
component (PFC), and the ITER/CDA adopted graphite for PFC. The
beryllium dust production in the ITER/EDA reactor will range from 7.0
to 10.3 kg/disruption, which strongly depends on vapor shield
effects. The carbon dust production in the ITER/CDA reactor will range
from 1.9 to 2.4 kg/disruption. However, the carbon dust will increase
by as much as a factor of 2 to 5 because the effective latent heat of
graphite has a large uncertainty under the extremely high heat flux
during disruptions. For both, dust production from the first wall
depends on the current quench time during disruptions. If the current
quench time can be extended, the beryllium dust from the first wall
will be minimized, and the carbon dust from there will be negligible.
<p>


<a name=7><b>On Modeling of Beryllium Molten Depths in Simulated Plasma Disruptions</b><br></a>
<i>George Tsotridis, Hans Rother</i>
<p>

Plasma-facing components in tokamak-type fusion reactors are subjected
to intense heat loads during plasma disruptions. The influence of high
heat fluxes on the depth of heat-affected zones of pure beryllium
metal and beryllium containing very low levels of surface active
impurities is studied by using a two-dimensional transient computer
model that solves the equations of motion and energy. Results are
presented for a range of energy densities and disruption times. Under
certain conditions, impurities, through their effect on surface
tension, create convective flows and hence influence the flow
intensities and the resulting depths of the beryllium molten layers
during plasma disruptions. The calculated depths of the molten layers
are also compared with other mathematical models that are based on the
assumption that heat is transported through the material by conduction
only.
<p>


<a name=8><b>Spark-Induced Radiation from Hydrogen or Deuterium-Loaded Palladium</b><br></a>
<i>Ernest D. Klema, Gerald W. Iseler</i>
<p>

Three sets of experiments were conducted to investigate the radiation
produced by spark discharge on (a) oxidized palladium samples, (b)
oxidized palladium samples loaded with hydrogen, and (c) oxidized
palladium samples loaded with deuterium. In the first set, no
radiation was measured above background; in the second set, 24-keV X
rays were observed, and in the third set, 17-keV X rays were produced.
<p>

The intensities of the hydrogen X rays were measured over a period of
12 days. During this time, the daily fluctuations overshadowed any
long-term variation that might be present. The deuterium X rays were
followed over a period of 26 weeks. Again, the intensities fluctuated
with time, obscuring the long-term trend; in one case, there was a 40%
change from one day to the next.

<p>
<a name=0><b>Evolution and Status of D-<sup>3</sup>He Fusion: A Critical Review</b><br></a>
<i>W. R. Fundamenski, A. A. Harms</i>
<p>

Advanced fuels for nuclear fusion---of which deuterium and
<sup>3</sup>He mixture is the leading candidate---could reduce tritium
inventory, neutron fluence, structural damage, and activation in
future reactors as well as allow for direct energy conversion. The
feasibility of D-<sup>3</sup>He fusion is assessed based on recent
developments in the areas of fuel resources, fusion and plasma
physics, magnetic and inertial reactors, space propulsion, reactor
safety, and waste disposal. It appears that D-<sup>3</sup>He fusion is
not well suited to the conventional tokamak design (<img
src="/graphics/symbols/beta.gif">&nbsp;~&nbsp;10%) because of
excessive synchrotron loss and closed field topology. High-beta and/or
non-Maxwellian plasma configurations are promising but at present lack
a sufficient experimental database to predict reactor-relevant
behavior. Space propulsion appears to be a most advantageous
application of D-<sup>3</sup>He fusion.

<p>
<a name=1><b>Shakedown and Ratcheting Analyses of Fusion Reactor First Wall</b><br></a>
<i>Saurin Majumdar, Joerg Wolters</i>
<p>

Bree diagrams are developed for shakedown and ratcheting analyses of a
typical fusion reactor first wall subjected to cyclic thermal and
steady primary stresses. The stresses are assumed to be predominantly
of the bending type. The first loading/unloading cycle is analyzed
analytically as well as numerically using elastic-plastic beam bending
theory. The general problem of elastic shakedown is solved using the
shakedown theorem of perfect plasticity. The problem of plastic strain
cycling with and without ratcheting is solved using numerical
analysis.

<a name=2><b>Eddy Currents in the Toroidal Field Core of the Low-Aspect-Ratio Tokamak START</b><br></a>
<i>R. J. Colchin</i>
<p>


START, a low-aspect-ratio tokamak located at Culham Laboratory in
England, has a central copper rod that carries the whole of the
toroidal field current. A small ohmic heating (OH) solenoid is wound
around this central rod. The OH-driven currents in the solenoid are
opposed by eddy currents in the copper rod, decreasing the
volt-seconds available to drive plasma current. These eddy currents
were measured and were modeled by a Laplace-transformed cylindrical
heat equation. Slots in the central rod inhibit the eddy currents,
increasing the effective poloidal resistance of the rod.


<p>
<a name=3><b>In Situ Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis of Hydrogen Isotopes During Deuterium Implantation into Metals</b><br></a>
<i>Akira Kitamura, Takakazu Saitoh, Hiroshi Itoh</i>
<p>

Elastic recoil detection (ERD) analysis is successfully applied to in
situ measurements of hydrogen isotope distributions formed in
palladium and titanium during deuterium ion implantation to observe
phenomena connected with so-called cold fusion. In situ analysis is
shown to be effective in identifying the physical processes occurring
in such hydrogen-metal systems.
<p>

The system is equipped with charged-particle detectors not only for
the detection of nuclear reaction products occurring under bombardment
with kilo-electron-volt deuterium ions but also for ERD analyses using
a mega-electron-volt accelerator. The beam-target D(d,p)t reaction
yield during implantation is dependent on the beam current or the
deuterium flux. This is interpreted in terms of a temperature
dependence of the deuterium concentration that is measured in situ by
the ERD method.
<p>

During the bombardment with heavy ions for ERD, measurements of
reaction products are also made simultaneously with those of the
recoil particles to clarify the structure of the spectra, although
some unidentified peaks remain.


<p>
<a name=4><b>Analysis of Heavy-Ion-Induced Deuteron-Deuteron Fusion in Solids</b><br></a>
<i>Kenji Konashi, Hideo Kayano, Makoto Teshigawara</i>
<p>

When energetic heavy ions irradiate a deuteride titanium target, a
number of recoil deuterium atoms are produced in the solid. The recoil
deuterium atoms cause deuteron-deuteron (d-d) fusion reactions in
solids. The probability of the d-d fusion reaction has been calculated
for the primary colliding deuterium atoms, as well as the collision
cascade deuterium atoms. Based on calculated results, an experiment
using a heavy-ion accelerator was proposed to study d-d fusion in
solids. The enhancement effect on d-d fusion in solids is particularly
interesting. The experimental parameters were as follows: The energy
of the ion beam for the d-d fusion experiment was in the range from
several to several tens of mega-electron-volts for an experiment with
an iodine ion beam and a titanium target. The enhancement effect in
the solid is evaluated by comparing the experimental results with the
present calculated results. The existence of the enhancement at low
energies can be confirmed by measuring the depth profile of the
fusion probabilities. Reported experimental data have been analyzed by
the calculated results. The enhancement has not been found in the
data.

<i>Tadahiko Mizuno, Tadashi Akimoto, Kazuhisa Azumi, Masatoshi Kitaichi, Kazuya Kurokawa, Michio Enyo</i>
<p>

A coin-shaped proton conductor made from metal oxides of strontium and
cerium can be charged in a hot D<sub>2</sub> gas atmosphere to produce
excess heat. Anomalous heat evolution was observed from the proton
conductors charged with alternating current at 5 to 45 V at
temperatures ranging from 400 to 700 degrees C. The anomalous heat
produced temperature increases as much as 50 degrees C. Excess heat
was estimated as a few watts in most cases, totaling up to several
kilojoules.


<p>
<a name=6><b>An Interpretation of Some Postelectrolysis Nuclear Effects in Deuterated Titanium</b><br></a>
<i>Miguel Alguero, Jose Francisco Fernandez, Fermin Cuevas, Carlos Sanchez</i>
<p>

An explanation is proposed for the time dependence of the neutron
emission transient observed after interrupting the electrolysis in
Fleischmann-Pons-type experiments with titanium cathodes. It is
suggested that the time structure of the neutron emission is related
to a reduction of active volume (i.e., the volume with a loading ratio
higher than the critical value necessary for cold fusion to take
place) in the deuterated titanium. This reduction occurs during the
postelectrolysis time due to deuterium transport from the
TiD<sub>x</sub> delta-phase layer to the undeuterated bulk of the
cathode. Calculations of the active volume decrease are done by using
the Wagner model.


<p>
<a name=7><b>Reproducible D/Pd Ratio &lt;1 and Excess Heat Correlation by 1-<img src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif">s-Pulse, High-Current Electrolysis</b><br></a>
<i>Francesco Celani, Antonio Spallone, Paolo Tripodi, Alessandra Petrocchi, Daniele Di Gioacchino, Massimiliano Boutet, Paolo Marini, Vittorio Di Stefano, Marco Diociaiuti, William Collis</i>
<p>

A high-current (up to 100 A), short-pulse (1-<img src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif">s duration)
electrolysis technique is presented that permits high loading (D/Pd up
to 1.2) of deuterium in palladium cathodes. Several different
cold-worked palladium plates were used as cathodes, and some underwent
surface treatments (oxidation or addition of intermetallic
compounds). The surface-treated plates showed atypical deuterium
absorption dynamics, and the D/Pd loading ratio exceeded 1. Moreover,
during initial loading, these cathodes showed anomalous excess heat
(up to 80%) far greater than the absorption enthalpy. The pure
palladium surface plates did not show this effect.


<p>
<a name=8><b>Deuteron Screening, Nuclear Reactions in Solids, and Superconductivity</b><br></a>
<i>S. N. Vaidya</i>
<p>

Screening of Coulomb interactions by itinerant deuterons contributes
to the enhancement of the deuteron-deuteron reaction rate in some
metal deuterides and fast deuteron conductors such as PdD<sub>x</sub>,
D<sub>y</sub>Na<sub>x</sub>WO<sub>3</sub>, SrCeO<sub>3</sub>:Y, Nb,
and so forth. We propose that the deuteron screening mechanism also
gives rise to the anomalous isotope effect in the PdD(H) system and to
the increase in the superconducting transition temperature
T<sub>c</sub> of
D<sub>x</sub>YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-<img src="/graphics/symbols/delta.gif"></sub>. In
conjunction with the currently known factors that govern
superconductivity, the deuteron screening might lead to a new class of
superconductors.

<i><b>"Explosion Rocks Nuclear Waste Silo at Point Beach Nuclear Plant"</b><br>
CITIZENS' UTILITY BOARD RELEASE, 5/29/96</i><br>
Contact:  David Merritt (608) 251-3322
<p>


The first radioactive waste storage "explosion" at a US nuclear plant
occurred at 2:45 am on 5/28 inside a nuclear waste silo at Wisconsin
Electric Power Company's Point Beach nuclear power plant.  Following
the accident, the state's first above- ground nuclear waste dump was
closed for the second time in five months.  "DAILY UTILITY NEWS" has
found little newspaper coverage of the event (see below).
<p>

According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's initial report, an 
unidentified gas ignited inside a cask fully loaded with spent fuel 
rods as it was being welded shut, causing the explosion.  There were 
no injuries and no radioactivity was released.
<p>

Each 18-foot-high cask is loaded with 14 tons of radioactive waste,
including 170 pounds of plutonium, and each loaded silo contains the
"equivalent radioactivity of 240 Hiroshima-type explosions."  Federal
guidelines require the waste to be "kept safe" for 10,000 years.
<p>

In 12/95, a Dane County Circuit Court judge had shut down the
facility, ruling that the Public Service Commission's environmental
impact statement was "fatally flawed" because it did not consider how
long waste may need to be stored in WI and didn't "evaluate economic
energy alternatives."  On 5/20/96, the PSC issued a new order
reopening the dump, and one week later the explosion occurred.
<p>

David Merritt, executive director of Citizens' Utility Board, said
"It's time for WEPCO to stop experimenting with nuclear waste on Lake
Michigan."  CUB will ask for an immediate PSC investigation and an
order reversing the reopening; the group also "will likely" file a
lawsuit challenging that order.

<i><b>"It Turns Out Power Isn't Always Sexy"</b><br>
BOSTON GLOBE ONLINE, 5/24/96</i><br>
Chris Reidy
<p>

With deregulation advancing in the electric utility industry,
companies are trying to figure out how to convince consumers that "our
electricity is better than their electricity."
<p>

In California, one supplier touts the "socially responsible kilowatt,"
promising power will not be generated by a nuclear reactor or a plant
with a poor environmental record.  In New Hampshire, companies in a
competition pilot program are wooing customers with "spruce seedlings,
free showerheads -- even $50 checks."
<p>

"Already, the kilowatt battle reminds some observers of the marketing
wars waged by long-distance companies," the BOSTON GLOBE reports.  New
Hampshire's airwaves "crackle" with TV ads for competing power
suppliers.  So far, established players like Public Service of New
Hampshire and New England Electric have been more restrained, favoring
newspaper ads and educational material included with bills.  Boston
Edison is "considering escalating its campaign," aiming to invest
Edison with a "meaningful personality" and help it "brand the
kilowatt."

<i><b>"Research for Reactor Nobody Wants"</b><br>
WASHINGTON POST, 5/28/96, p. A9</i><br>
Guy Gugliotta
<p>

Over the next few months, Rep. Mark Foley (R-FL) will try to kill
federal subsidies for private research on the Advanced Light Water
Reactor, which is billed as providing "a new generation" of better
performing nuclear power plants.  "Except nobody in the United States
wants one," writes Guy Gugliotta in the WASHINGTON POST, noting a
recent poll of utility execs indicating most would never again order a
new nuclear power plant.
<p>

But "the nuclear industry is not going to roll over," the POST
reports.  Nuclear Energy Institute spokesman Steve Unglesbee: "In the
next decade, the balance of power demand will shift ... because of
aging and environmental concerns."  Despite nuclear's declining cost-
competitiveness versus coal, natural gas and even wind power,
Unglesbeee says, "We think nuclear will be a contender."
<p>

Since the 1992 Energy Policy Act authorized five years of funding,
beginning in 1993, ALWR backers say the FY '97 request of $30.3
million "simply fulfills" the pledge made in the act.  But Foley
argues that the three firms receiving the money -- General Electric,
Westinghouse and Asea Brown Boveri's Combustion Engineering unit --
"don't need the help of the federal government."

<i><b>"Agency Discovers Refueling Errors at 14 Nuclear Power Plants"</b><br>
NEW YORK TIMES, 5/26/96, p. 17</i><br>
Matthew Wald
<p>

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued a public report finding
that refueling errors at Millstone 1 Plant in Waterford, CT, were
common at 14 other reactors around the country, which all have "moved
to correct" the problem.
<p>

The Millstone Plant had been removing all of its nuclear fuel
assemblies during refueling, instead of the designated one-third, and
storing them in a spent fuel pool.  Too many assemblies in the pool,
especially ones recently removed from a reactor, "theoretically" could
generate enough heat to boil away the cooling water, "raising the
possibility" that the fuel would melt down and release radioactivity
into the atmosphere.
<p>

Employees at Northeast Utilities, which operates the plant, 
reported the spent-fuel storage problem to the NRC, which then 
surveyed the 110 commercial reactors in the US and found the following 
ones committing the same error:
<ul>
  <li> Cooper in Brownville, NE (owned by NE Public Power District);
  <li> McGuire 1 and 2 in Cowans Ford Dam, SC, and Oconee 1, 2, and 3
       in Lake Keowee, SC, (Duke Power Co.);
  <li> North Anna 1 and 2 in Mineral, VA (owned mainly by Virginia
       Electric and Power Co.);
  <li> South Texas 1 and 2 in Matagorda County (Houston Lighting and
       Power Co., mainly);
  <li> Summer in Jenkinsville, SC (SC Electric and Gas Co.,mainly);
  <li> Turkey Point 3 and 4 near Miami, FL (Florida Power and Light
       Co.); and
  <li> Alvin W. Vobtle, in Waynesboro, GA (Georgia Power Co., mainly).
</ul>
<p>

NRC staff said all of the utilities involved had pledged to study
their fuel pools and, if they are overheating, to change storage
practices.  The safety of spent-fuel pools "has become a bigger issue
in the last few years because the Energy Dept. has not found a
permanent repository for the wastes."
<p>

<i><b>"NRC Lowers Pilgrim Rating"</b><br>
BOSTON GLOBE, 5/25/96, p. 25</i><br>
Scott Allen
<p>

A "pattern of mistakes" at Boston Edison's Pilgrim nuclear power plant
prompted the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Friday to downgrade the
plant's safety ratings "for the first time in eight years."  The
report -- which comes as the utility is cutting the plant's work force
-- found that workers had mistakenly shipped radioactive wastes to a
laundry and a battery- recycling center.  Also, workers at the plant
were exposed to "unusually high levels" of radioactivity, bucking an
industry trend toward reduced exposures.
<p>

"Pilgrim officials, who just completed a record 319-day run of the
plant without stopping for repairs, said they were disappointed."
Edison Senior VP E. Thomas Boulette said, "We cannot be satisfied with
'good' performance," adding the company would do whatever it takes to
earn "superior" ratings in all areas.  The NRC had "steadily improved"
its ratings of Pilgrim since the mid-1980s, when it was considered one
of the five worst-run plants in the country.  In 1994, it was one of
the nation's two best-run plants.
<p>

The downbeat report comes as the electric-utility industry braces for
greater competition, "putting intense pressure on plant managers to
reduce costs."  "But nuclear power, with its potential for
environmental damage," will face "special scrutiny" during the
transition, the BOSTON GLOBE reports.

<i><b>"Back on Line, Reactor Aims at Full Power"</b><br>
ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT-GAZETTE, 5/26/96, p. 1B</i><br>
Staff and Wire Services
<p>

The Arkansas Nuclear One power plant in Russellville, AR, owned by
Entergy Corp., "eased" back on line Saturday after being shut down
since May 19.  Entergy officials said a piece of monitoring equipment
had "wrongly indicated" that the reactor's cooling-pump speed had
dropped. The reading caused an automatic shutdown of the reactor.  The
pump in question supplies water to the plant's steam-generator system.
<p>

A five-man team from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which
investigated the shutdown and reviewed the plant's systems, found
problems in electronic equipment installed last year that led to the
"erroneous reading."  After the shutdown, one of 16 safety valves
designed to close automatically stuck open.  Entergy officials said
both problems have been corrected.
<p>

The NRC team, which left the site on Friday, will issue a final report
in three weeks, and the NRC will hold a public meeting in the
Russellville area to discuss the findings.  Although the NRC has fined
the plant $545,000 for nine separate violations since 1984, it has
received superior and good ratings in recent years.

<i><b>"Fire Torches Idle Browns Ferry Nuke Plant Tower"</b><br>
MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL, 5/24/96, p. A17</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

An idled cooling tower at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant on May 23 was
"destroyed by flames" in "the latest of a string of fires that has
plagued the plant for two decades."
<p>

Tennessee Valley Authority officials said that no one was hurt by the
early morning fire and there was no radiation threat.  Plant spokesman
Terry Johnson said the public was not notified because the fire
occurred outside the plant.  The plant's two reactors were not
affected by the fire.
<p>

Browns Ferry, located on the Tennessee River about 100 miles north of
Birmingham, AL, has been the site of at least three fires since 1975,
including one that was considered at the time the nation's worst
nuclear accident.
<p>

<i><b>"Edison's Competition Plan:  A 'Fortress' Balance Sheet"</b><br>

Francine Knowles
<p>

Top executives of Chicago's Unicom Corp., the parent of Commonwealth
Edison, told shareholders Wednesday the company is preparing for utility
industry competition by creating a "fortress balance sheet."  In response
to critics of the firm's stance -- Unicom has proposed delaying full-scale
competition until -- Chairman James O'Connor said: "We don't intend to be
brought into the competitive arena kicking and screaming.  We will embrace
competition because we're convinced that we can win in the
... marketplace."  ...  Some shareholders said "things aren't as bright as
the company claims," blasting the utility's falling stock price and
multi-million- dollar executive salaries.  O'Connor said the downturn
resulted from the company's decision to invest $70 million in improvements
at its nuclear plants.

<i><b>"A Fiscal Meltdown"</b><br>
FISHWRAP SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE ONLINE, 5/22/96</i><br>
Jonathan Marshall
<p>

San Francisco-based Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has filed a restructuring plan
with the CA Public Utilities Commission in which the utility would speed
the depreciation of its Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in order to
maintain its competitiveness.
<p>

PG&amp;E wants to write off the remaining $3.8 billion book value on its
plant 15 years ahead of its initial target date of 2016.  By doing so, it
would be able to lower its electricity rates while still showing a profit.
Chris Warner of PG&amp;E: "Our goal is to get Diablo in a position where it
will operate for many years and continue being an economic benefit to the
county."
<p>

However, the county of San Luis Obispo, where Diablo is located, is voicing
strong protests, saying that the plan violates "moral" and "legal"
commitments PG&amp;E made to the community.  The county stands to lose
nearly $10 million a year from lower property tax revenues under the plan.
<p>

James Boothe, an aide to PUC Commissioner Daniel Fessler, said the
commission likely will not stop the restructuring process because of one
county's woes.  Unless restructuring advances, Boothe said, Californians
will never enjoy lower rates.

<i><b>"We Shouldn't Export Nuclear Waste"</b><br>
MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE, 5/18/96, p. 23A</i><br>
David Morris, John Bailey, Institute for Local Self-Reliance
<p>

"We have yet to discover a safe way to deal with the radioactive wastes
generated from nuclear power plants," write David Morris and John Bailey in
the MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE.
<p>

Yet, they assert that measures such as the proposed Yucca Mountain
radioactive waste repository which would "force Nevada to become the
nation's radioactive waste dump," are not the answer.  Instead, the pair
argue that states should take responsibility for their own wastes, and not
"whine about how the federal government has done us wrong."
<p>

They advocate a "major engineering upgrade" in dry cask design for wastes
to allow for 100 year or greater storage capacity.  They also suggest
finding a community in Minnesota that would serve as a storage site, "for
the right price."  Finally, they assert that nuclear power must be phased
out in the state.  Although that move would end up raising electricity
rates, that is the "modest" price "we pay for having made an irresponsible
decision."

<i><b>"End Corporate Welfare for Nuclear Reactors"</b><br>
SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE, 5/20/96, p. A18</i><br>
Editorial
<p>

No US electric utility has ordered a new nuclear reactor in years, and a
recent survey of utility execs found there is "little hope" for industry
expansion.  "So why are taxpayers still being asked to fork over hundreds
of millions of dollars to mature, highly profitable companies" like General
Electric and Westinghouse "to develop new nuclear power reactors?"  The SAN
FRANCISCO CHRONICLE editorial page editors suggest that the Dept. of
Energy's Advanced Light Water Reactor program be ended.
<p>

"Except for the reactor's export potential, it's hard to see" how the
program can be justified, the CHRONICLE writes.  But federal law says the
subsidies are for development of reactors to be built and operated in the
US.  And even if there is a lucrative export market, there's "no reasons"
why major companies couldn't finance their own R&amp;D programs.  The
subsidy should be allowed to expire in September, the editorial concludes.

<i><b>"A Day of Reckoning for NU"</b><br>

Editorial
<p>

Amid this week's heavy coverage by the HARTFORD COURANT of Northeast
Utilities' nuclear power woes, the paper's editorial page opined,
"Stockholders, neighbors and customers ... have good reason to be outraged"
at the decisions taken by management in recent years.  "Facing increasing
competition and financial pressures, NU's leaders decided one way to cut
costs was to meet only minimum safety standards and do repairs on the
cheap. ... The consequences have been disastrous," with NU's Millstone
nuclear power plant closed by the NRC, federal investigations looking into
alleged mistreatment of whistleblowers and the company's stock price
plummeting.
<p>

Current managers bear "much of the blame," but former Chairman William
Ellis and the NRC "must be held to account, too," the COURANT concludes.

<i><b>"Telephone Signals to Run Home Appliances"</b><br>
CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 5/22/96, p. B1</i><br>
David Young
<p>

Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. next fall plans to begin testing
a program which will allow the utility to manage residents' major home
appliances over the phone.
<p>

ComEd will work with telephone company Ameritech Corp. to offer the
service free of charge to as many as 2,000 Chicago-area homes.  The
pilot program would allow the utility to remotely run customers'
furnaces, water heaters, refrigerators and other appliances in order
to take advantage of lower off-peak rates.
<p>

The program is part of Edison's strategy to better prepare for
increased competition brought on by industry deregulation.  ComEd
charges higher rates than neighboring utilities because of its
reliance on nuclear power, and has been "under pressure" to cut rates.
Last year, company officials announced the home management system as
part of their plan for deregulation and a rate freeze.

Electric utilities in the Northeast cut off power to many customers
and urged others to use less as a "freakish" May heat wave caught many
utilities "offguard."  "The moves could presage a summer of possible
rising prices and power outages in the Northeast, where a sizable
portion of generating capacity has been idled by federally ordered
nuclear-plant shutdowns. "
<p>

Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities, New Jersey's Public Service
Enterprise Group and Pennsylvania's PP&amp;L Resources reduced or cut
off service to hundreds of commercial, industrial and residential
customers. The New England Power Pool shaved voltage to Connecticut
customers by 5%, while Consolidated Edison of New York dropped voltage
by 8% and cut power to 115,000 residents.
<p>

Yesterday's load in New England went as high as 18,000 megawatts,
compared to the seasonal average of 15,000 megawatts.

Many power plants in the region were offline for maintenance.
Mechanical troubles caused by thunderstorms also added to the day's
difficulties "and can be rectified in short order."  But given that
none of the three shuttered nuclear reactors owned by NU is expected
to restart until August, analysts predicted higher prices for
electricity and a much more active wholesale spot market.

<i><b>"5 in Waste Compact Ordered to Try Again For a Settlement"</b><br>

Paul Hammel
<p>

A US District Court judge ordered Nebraska and a five-state compact to
meet "one last time" to hammer out a settlement over the withholding
of federal funds to build a low-level radioactive waste storage
facility near Butte, NE.  Judge David Piester ordered the parties to
meet on May 23 to work out an agreement.
<p>

The five-state compact's Facility Review Committee has argued that
Nebraska has been careless and slow with the license review process
for the waste site.  The state argues that the compact's insistence on
enforcing a schedule for completion of the state's license review is
"impractical."
<p>

The compact commission is in charge of developing a disposal site for
low-level radioactive waste from Nebraska, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas
and Louisiana.  "The vast majority of such waste comes from nuclear
power plants," and power plant operators such as the Omaha Public
Power District and Nebraska Public Power District are primarily
financing the project.

<i><b>"NRC is Questioning Assurances on Plant of Northeast Utilities"</b><br>
WALL STREET JOURNAL, 5/21/96, p. B9</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission "questioned safety assurances" given
by the managers of the Connecticut Yankee nuclear power plant in
Haddam Neck, CT, "raising the chances that the plant could be shut
down."  In a letter last Friday to Northeast Utilities, the main
equity holder in the plant, the NRC said findings by a team of its
inspectors "call into question" Northeast's contention that safety
issues at the plant were "minor."
<p>

Northeast is also owner of the Millstone nuclear power plant in
Waterford, CT, which is currently shut down for intense NRC scrutiny.
<p>

Separately, NU said its No. 2 nuclear officer, Fred Dacimo, left the
company for unspecified reasons.
<p>

"The mounting troubles ... came as Northeast prepared for what is
expected to be a contentious shareholders' meeting today" in Stamford,
CT.  The utility's stock has plunged 41% this year, the WALL STREET

<p>

In a two-part series based on its own 3-month investigation, the
COURANT examines the sagging fortunes of Northeast Utilities, whose
stock price has "plunged" from $25 a share to $15.25.  Part One, "Down
a Dangerous Path at NU: Cutting Costs, Corners," the COURANT says the
US Nuclear Regulatory Commission decision of 1/96 to add the Millstone
plants to its watch list "could have come much sooner."  The NRC gave
the Millstone units, once "model" nuclear power plants, more "waivers
from license requirements" than any other plant.
<p>

The article includes a "Troubled Times at Millstone" timeline that
traces troubles back to 4/86 when the last Millstone plant went on
line, $3 billion over budget.  The nuclear operation has been "in
turmoil" ever since as "cost containment trumped safety" in
preparation for deregulated competition.
<p>

Part Two, "Whistle-blowers: NU's Most Vexing Issue," begins with the
premise that the three Millstone reactors in Waterford, CT, are shut
down "indefinitely" because of problems identified "in large measure"
by its own employees.  The reporters find "several recurring themes"
in the NU treatment of whistle- blowers: a "tendency" to refer
"troublesome" employees for psychological counseling or to pay them
cash settlements to leave the co. and, "in some instances, to keep
quiet."

since 1994 and a mothballed plant in Armenia is back on line, bringing
the total number to 438, according to the International Atomic Energy
Agency (WASHINGTON TIMES, 5/20/96, p. A12, Staff Report).

<i><b>"Beware of Nuke Costs, Some Watchdogs Say"</b><br>
SYRACUSE POST-STANDARD, 5/17/96, p. D1</i><br>

<p>

The New York Public Service Commission's decision on May 16 to move
the state's electric utility industry to competition "means power
plants will have to compete, and this could spell trouble for nuclear
reactors, some interest groups believe."
<p>

Ashok Gupta of the Natural Resources Defense Council said that
uneconomical power plants won't be operating in the future.  Nuclear
plants will be "high on the problem list" because of high fixed costs.
NRDC believes that if reactors can't compete, they should be shut
down.
<p>

Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. owns two nuclear power plants in Oswego
County, NY while the New York Power Authority runs a third.  The three
reactors can "barely compete" now, according to James Riccio of the
consumer group Critical Mass Energy Project.  Riccio: "This is going
to be a weeding out process."
<p>

Gupta believes one-quarter to one-third of the nuclear plants in the
US will not be able to compete, even though regulators may be able to
shield them from competition.  However, Consumer Protection Board
spokesman Steven LaFever felt that by allowing competition, the PSC
almost guaranteed that the price of electricity in the long-term will
decline.  LaFever: "We're very happy."

<i><b>"TVA Devises Payment Plan for Shutting Down Reactors"</b><br>
NASHVILLE TENNESSEAN, 5/16/96, p. 6B</i><br>
Associated Press
<p>

The Tennessee Valley Authority's board on 5/16 approved a plan to pay
for closing the agency's nuclear plants in the next century.  TVA
directors also approved a $123 million contribution to the
decommissioning fund, bringing it to about $400 million.
<p>

"TVA has come under fire about the fund recently because the agency
depleted the fund in 1993 to take advantage of a $163 million
investment profit."  The new contribution should restore the fund to
the 1993 level.  TVA assumes the fund will grow through investments
and be able to cover the $4 billion estimated cost of closing down
TVA's six reactors, beginning about 2016.
<p>

Federal law requires every US utility company to maintain a fund for
decommissioning nuclear plants.  "TVA, the nation's largest public
power producer, is the exception to the rule," but it has still
maintained a decommissioning fund since 1977.

<i><b>"San Antonio Nuke Settlement 10 Times Austin's 'Victory'" </b><br>
AUSTIN AMERICAN-STATESMAN, 5/15/96, p. A1</i><br>
Diana Dworin and Ben Wear
<p>

Last month, Austin city leaders accepted a $20 million settlement to
end a lawsuit over "alleged mismanagement" of the South Texas Project
nuclear power plant by Houston Lighting &amp; Power; now they're
having second thoughts since the City of San Antonio may come out 10
times better in its settlement with HL&amp;P over the same plant.  San
Antonio's publicly owned utility, City Public Services, has
"tentatively" accepted a settlement valued at $225 million with $75
million in cash and $150 million in reduced operating costs.
<p>

The Austin settlement involved only mismanagement, since the city
already had taken HL&amp;P to court in 1989 to dispute cost overruns
in constructing the $6 billion plant, winning a verdict but receiving
no damages from the jury.  In contrast, the San Antonio agreement,
still subject to final approval by the utility board, "puts to rest" a
lawsuit over mismanagement that led to a 14-month shutdown and a
construction dispute.  Austin owns only a 16% share of the STP plant,
while San Antonio owns a 28% stake.  Austin City Council members,
nettled by the larger settlement, point out that City Public Services,
originally a partner in the Austin lawsuit, pulled out just before the
trial started, announcing that it had reached a settlement, the terms
of which only now have become public.

<i><b>"Oversight at Yankee"</b><br>
BANGOR DAILY NEWS, 5/15/96</i><br>
Editorial
<p>

Maine Gov. Angus King (I) "properly" hired an outside consultant last
month to review a proposal by the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant to
return to full power, but the BANGOR DAILY NEWS says he should expand
the investigation.  An NRC report, issued last week, also suggested
widening the review.
<p>

Victor Ransom, head of the nuclear engineering program at Purdue Univ., 
is reviewing a computer program submitted by plant officials to the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to justify a return to full power. Maine 
Yankee, an older plant that recently went through the "world's largest 
re-sleeving job" to repair cracked tubes in its steam generator, was 
held to 90% power after an anonymous letter criticized the computer 
model that predicts what would happen during a loss-of-coolant 
accident. Although an NRC internal review showed the letter writer was 
"generally correct" in charging lax oversight, the newspaper said this 
did not mean charges of "willful negligence" against Maine Yankee 
officials "also were on target."
<p>

Calling for an "outside expert" to review practices going back to 1989
when NRC admitted "to dozing off," the editorial said the reason no
nuclear power plants have been built in the US in a generation is that
"a measurable and loud portion" of the public does not trust them to
be safe.  The state should have assurances that even during the time
of lax oversight, Maine Yankee was operating well within safety
limits.

ROCK HILL [SC] HERALD, 5/15/96, p. 10A</i><br>

<p>

South Carolina will once again sue the US DOE over the shipment of
spent foreign nuclear fuel to the Savannah River Site nuclear weapons
complex, said Gov. David Beasley (R) on May 14.
<p>

During the next 13 years, as many as 300 fuel shipments will enter the
port of Charleston, and be taken by truck or rail to the SRS, about
125 miles away.  The DOE argues that the US must take back the fuel it
sold to foreign research reactors, to protect against the spread of
the weapons-grade material.
<p>

Beasley said the government did not perform the proper environmental
reviews and might end up leaving the waste in SC because the DOE
doesn't have a credible, long-term storage plan.  The government's
proposed permanent repository at Yucca Mountain, NV is "far from"
completed.  SC's Attorney General will file suit before June 1.

<i><b>"NU Calling Its Older Plants To Active Duty"</b><br>
HARTFORD COURANT, 5/15/96, p. 1F</i><br>
Barbara A. Nagy
<p>

"With Northeast Utilities's much larger and more efficient Millstone
nuclear reactors off line indefinitely in Waterford," about a half
dozen smaller and older power plants around Connecticut are "gearing
up" to meet peak summer demand.
<p>

NU's three Millstone reactors are on the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's "watch list" of troubled facilities, and are off line
while the utility works to prove they are operating safely.
<p>

Meanwhile, the utility is spending $25 million to reactivate old
plants, working feverishly to bring in alternative power and ready
transmission lines by July 1 -- the company's self-imposed deadline
for preparing for summer heat waves.
<p>

NU is bringing two retired fossil-fuel plants in Middletown and
Bridgeport Harbor back on line, and leasing five General Electric Co.
40-megawatt power generators.  The utility has also asked Pratt amp;
Whitney to generate and sell excess power to it this summer, and is
working with the state to obtain emergency permits and waivers for all
the work.
<p>

Robert Gunderson, manager of the recommissioned Devon station, pointed
all out the activity at the plant to a HARTFORD COURANT reporter.
Gunderson: "A week ago Friday, there was nothing here.  ... It's an
incredible effort."

<i><b>"Questions Surround Financial Status of Waste-Site Firm"</b><br>
OMAHA WORLD-HERALD, 5/13/96, p. 11</i><br>
Julie Anderson
<p>

An official of American Ecology Corp. -- the parent company of a firm
developing a radioactive-waste storage site in Nebraska -- said the
company is in a "difficult position" financially and is negotiating
with shareholders for more cash to complete the waste-storage project.
<p>

An AEC spokesman said the company needs an infusion of "multimillions"
in cash to "address liabilities" the firm discovered in dealings with
two subsidiaries acquired in 1994.  The company is expected to post a
$33 million write-down of values associated with the two companies.
<p>

Rich Paton, vice president of AEC and its subsidiary US Ecology, said
his companies are in no danger of bankruptcy.  Paton also said AEC's
financial troubles would not stop it from obtaining a
construction-financing loan to build the low-level radioactive waste
site for Nebraska and four other states.
<p>

However, Gregory Hayden of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, who
sits on a five-state compact commission which oversees the AEC
project, said that several factors indicate that the company may be in
worse shape than previously thought.
<p>

The issue is significant for Nebraska utilities because there is a
possibility that electric ratepayers may get "stuck with the bill" if
AEC can't complete the facility.

<i><b>"How the French Get Power"</b><br>
THE ECONOMIST, 5/11/96 Issue, p. 62</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

Electricite de France, Europe's largest electricity company, has "long
championed" nuclear power, which "may prove to be its downfall," says
THE ECONOMIST.  European Union energy ministers met on 5/7 to plan
industry deregulation, but EDF is "doing everything" it can to
preserve its "near-monopoly."  Even though the utility has made
nuclear power a symbol of national pride, its profits are "meager"
compared with those of many privatized electricity firms.
<p>

By standardizing reactor design, the utility has kept nuclear power
costs "relatively low;" French electricity prices are "much lower"
than Germany's.  Since completing most of the "current generation" of
reactors in France, the utility has "exported its expertise" to China,
Eastern Europe, Spain and Argentina.  But decommissioning French
reactors is another matter, and critics contend that EDF may have
underestimated the sum needed.  If full decommissioning costs were
included in electricity prices, it would be "more expensive," they
say. Storage of high-level radioactive waste is another "looming"
problem.
<p>

But EDF "worries most" about Europe-wide electricity deregulation.  If
the utility beghan to lose its reputation as a creator of jobs and if
its financiers began to demand market- oriented accounting, "the whole
structure could collapse," THE ECONOMIST concludes.

<a name=2><b>Toward Long-Pulse, High-Performance Discharges in Tore Supra: Experimental Knowledge and Technological Developments for Heat Exhaust</b><br></a>
<i>Tore Supra Team</i>
<p>

In view of high-power, long-pulse steady-state operation, Tore Supra
has incorporated in its design the active control of heat and
particles in a realistic environment. In the early experimental phase
of Tore Supra, the first generation of plasma-facing components was
tested, and these tests provided much physics and technological
information and illuminated various operational difficulties. In
particular,these experiments revealed the weakness of the
graphite-to-metal brazing process originally adopted for actively
cooled high-heat-flux components. Consequently, a new inner-wall
technology was developed in 1994 and is to be tested in 1995-1996 with
a totally rebuilt 40-deg toroidal sector. A carbon-fiber-reinforced
carbon-metal compound is based on the newest brazing technology and
rigorous quality control. Components such as the toroidal pump limiter
and the guard limiters of plasma-heating antennas are being developed
in the same way. For structures where brazing is difficult, boron
carbide-coated components have been developed and installed in Tore
Supra. For lower heat fluxes, a bolted concept has been designed and
tested. The influence of inner-first-wall misalignment in Tore Supra
on the power exhaust limitation of brazed components has been studied.
<p>

Results from the technological development for the different power
exhaust systems and the associated experimental knowledge obtained
during plasma operation in Tore Supra are presented.

<a name=3><b>Evaluation of Porous Media Heat Exchangers for Fusion Applications</b><br></a>
<i>John H. Rosenfeld, James E. Lindemuth, Mark T. North, Robert D. Watson, Dennis L. Youchison, Richard H. Goulding</i>
<p>

Several types of porous media heat exchangers are being evaluated for
use in fusion applications. Broadly, these devices can be classified
as capillary-pumped (heat pipes) or mechanically-pumped heat
exchangers. Monel/water thermosyphon heat pipes with a porous metal
wick are being evaluated for use in Faraday shields. A subscale
prototype has been fabricated, and initial tests at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory have shown favorable results. Alkali metal heat pipes have
demonstrated absorbed heat flux capability of over 1000
MW/m<sup>2</sup>. An advanced gyrotron microwave cavity is being
developed that uses water cooling in a mechanically-pumped copper
porous metal heat exchanger. Tests on a prototype demonstrated
absorbed heat flux capability in excess of 100 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. Porous
metal heat exchangers with helium, water, or liquid metal coolants are
being evaluated for plasma-facing component cooling. Tests on a
helium/copper porous metal heat exchanger demonstrated absorbed heat
flux capability in excess of 15 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. Applications,
conceptual designs, fabricated hardware, and test results are
summarized.


<p>
<a name=4><b>Local Subcooled Flow-Boiling Model Development</b><br></a>
<i>Ronald D. Boyd, Xiaowei Meng</i>
<p>

Several existing heat transfer models for uniformly heated channels
were examined to accurately represent the boiling curve and to
characterize the local heat transfer coefficient under high-heat-flux
(HHF) conditions. Comparisons with HHF data showed that major
correlation modifications were needed in the subcooled partial
nucleate boiling (SPNB) region. Because the slope of the boiling curve
in this region is important to ensure continuity of the HHF trends
into the fully developed boiling region and up to the critical heat
flux, accurate characterization in the SPNB region is
essential. Approximations for the asymptotic limits for the SPNB
region have been obtained and have been used to develop an improved
composite correlation. The developed correlation has been compared
with 363 water data points. For the local heat transfer coefficient
and wall temperature, the overall percent standard deviations with
respect to the data were 19 and 30kI, respectively, for the
high-velocity water data.


<p>
<a name=5><b>Analytical Modeling of Complete Nukiyama Curves Corresponding to Expected Low Void Fraction at High Subcooling and Flow Rate</b><br></a>
<i>Diethelm Schroeder-Richter</i>
<p>

On the basis of a new hypothesis of thermodynamic states (the
superheated wall layer is not metastable but saturated at locally
elevated pressure), an analytical estimation is presented of the whole
boiling curve [except critical heat flux (CHF), but fixed at this
point, known by experiments or correlation]. The curvature of the
boiling curve (bubbly flow) is deduced from thermodynamics of
irreversible processes. The wall temperature corresponding to
departure from nucleate boiling is calculated from balances of
momentum at the interfaces, based on the assumption that the speed of
sound may be a limit for maximum evaporation mass flux and thereby
heat flux, i.e., CHF. Heat flux during transition boiling is
determined from balance of energy at the rewetting front. At the
Leidenfrost point, a minimum heat flux is neglected. Thus, Leidenfrost
temperature, as well as wall temperature at CHF, can be calculated
analytically without using empirical coefficients. Heat flux of bubbly
flow and transition boiling can be matched at any empirical CHF
point.
<p>

All these results are determined from properties of state alone, i.e.,
the models can be verified for all fluids including water and liquid
metals (so far at moderate heat fluxes). Especially the latter two
fluids are of interest for high-heat-flux application, and the
precondition of low void fraction is expected to be fulfilled.

<a name=6><b>Critical Heat Flux of Subcooled Flow Boiling in Swirl Tubes Relevant to High-Heat-Flux Components</b><br></a>
<i>Fujio Inasaka, Hideki Nariai</i>
<p>

It is necessary to accurately determine the critical heat flux (CHF)
of cooling systems used in fusion reactors. Currently, sufficiently
accurate CHF correlations for one-sided heating have not been
established. A design method for subcooled boiling cooling systems
using swirl tubes is described. From a review of existing work under
uniform heating conditions, the correlations of Gunther and
Nariai-Inasaka are recommended for smooth and swirl flow,
respectively. The effects of thermal conductivity and geometry of the
cooling sections on both the nonuniformity factor and the peaking
factor were investigated by solving a heat conduction equation. For
swirl flow under one-sided heating, the CHF multiplier increases with
the increasing nonuniformity factor. Design criteria for subcooled
boiling swirl-tube cooling systems are presented.


<p>
<a name=7><b>A Mechanistic Model for the Prediction of Water-Subcooled-Flow-Boiling Critical Heat Flux at High Liquid Velocity and Subcooling</b><br></a>
<i>Gian Piero Celata, Maurizio Cumo, Andrea Mariani, Giuseppe Zummo</i>
<p>

A new model is presented for the prediction of the critical heat flux
(CHF) of subcooled flow boiling based on a liquid-sublayer dryout
mechanism, i.e., the dryout of a thin, liquid layer beneath an
intermittent vapor blanket due to the coalescence of small
bubbles. The model focuses on the analysis of the CHF in subcooled
flow boiling under conditions of very high mass flux and liquid
subcooling, typical of fusion reactor thermal-hydraulic design, and is
characterized by the absence of empirical constants always present in
earlier models. Peripheral nonuniform heating and/or twisted-tape
inserts are accounted for in the model, which was originally developed
for uniform heating and straight flow. The simultaneous occurrence of
the two events is also well predicted by the model. Although initially
formulated for operating conditions typical of the thermal-hydraulic
design of fusion reactor high-heat-flux components, the model is
proven to be able to satisfactorily predict the CHF under more
general conditions, provided local thermodynamic conditions of the
bulk flow at the CHF are sufficiently far from the saturated state.


<p>
<a name=8><b>Effect of Porous Coating on Critical Heat Flux Removed by Subcooled Water at Low Flow Rates</b><br></a>
<i>Diethelm Schroeder-Richter, Sabiha Yildiz</i>
<p>

The critical heat flux (CHF) is studied experimentally in vertical
tubes heated directly using power current (direct current 2500 A, 15
V) and cooled with water at a low mass flow rate (0 to 0.2
Mg/m<sup>2</sup><img src="/graphics/symbols/dot.gif">s) and at low pressure (0.1 to 0.8 MPa). A
smooth tube and a tube with a porous coating layer sintered onto the
inner surface were used. The tube and the porous coating layer are
both made from INCONEL-600. The results (so far at moderate heat
fluxes) are compared with each other and with correlations by Katto
and by Weber. Enhancement of heat transfer was determined as well as a
negative effect of the porous coating below the expected value of CHF.
<p>

It seems that a disadvantage of the coated tube corresponds to the
apparently annular flow regime alone; whereas, the CHFs can be
enhanced by the porous layer as long as the bubbly flow pattern is
maintained up to the location of maximum heat flux. Obviously, the
latter situation is established during high-heat-flux conditions,
i.e., at high subcooling and high flow rate, which are the classical
design characteristics of high-heat-flux components in fusion
reactors.


<p>
<a name=9><b>Critical-Heat-Flux Experiment on the Screw Tube Under One-Sided-Heating Conditions</b><br></a>
<i>Masanori Araki, Kazuyoshi Sato, Satoshi Suzuki, Masato Akiba</i>
<p>

Development of high-heat-flux components such as the divertor plate of
fusion experimental machines is essential for removal of high heat
loads with heating on one side. For this purpose, the authors machined
a tube with an inside wall like a nut, namely, a screw tube, to
enhance heat transfer efficiency and simplify the machining
process. The screw tube is compared with a swirl tube, originally
developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Hypervapotron,
developed by Joint European Torus (JET). The spirally machined inside
wall can enlarge the heat transfer area and make a little vortex flow
only close to the wall. The performance of the screw tube is
characterized by a critical-heat-flux experiment that uses water flow
velocities ranging from 4 to 20 m/s with a water inlet pressure of 1.0
MPa. As a result, the screw tube has a higher incidence of CHFs
compared with the smooth tube and the Hypervapotron and performs
similarly to the swirl tube at identical flow velocities.

<a name=10><b>How Braze Flaws Affect the Thermal-Hydraulic Performance of the Tore Supra Phase-III Outboard Pump Limiter: A Case Study of the Effects of Nonuniform Thermal Resistance on the Peak Heat Flux to the Coolant for Tubes with One-Sided Heating</b><br></a>
<i>R. E. Nygren, J. D. Miller</i>
<p>

The Phase-III Outboard Pump Limiter is a heat sink made of pyrolytic
graphite armor brazed to water-cooled copper tubes. Around the inner
wall of the tube wall, some of the water can be in the subcooled
boiling regime. The central issue analyzed here is how the heat flow
in the tube changes when the thermal resistance along the heated
portion of the tube is redistributed. Cracks or braze flaws in the
joint between the tile and tube cause this redistribution. Severe
cracks or flaws reduce the power-handling capability of this assembly
because the local peak heat fluxes increase and, for a given critical
heat flux (CHF), the safety margin decreases. There were some
surprises. The increase in local peak heat flux for the most common
type of flaw encountered in the fabrication of this limiter was
negligible up to a flaw size of ~500kI. The
examples presented are intended as a case study that illuminates the
more general problem of how correlations for heat transfer and for CHF
developed for uniform circumferential heating are applied to a case of
one-sided heating.

<a name=11><b>Optimal Thermal-Hydraulic Performance for Helium-Cooled Divertors</b><br></a>
<i>Michael G. Izenson, Jerry L. Martin</i>
<p>

Normal flow heat exchanger (NFHX) technology offers the potential for
cooling divertor panels with reduced pressure drops (&lt;0.50kI <img
src="/graphics/symbols/Delta.gif">p/p), reduced pumping power
(&lt;0.750kI pumping/thermal power), and smaller duct sizes than
conventional helium heat exchangers. Furthermore, the NFHX can easily
be fabricated in the large sizes required for divertors in large
tokamaks. Recent experimental and computational results from a program
to develop NFHX technology for divertor cooling using porous metal
heat transfer media are described. We have tested the thermal and flow
characteristics of porous metals and identified the optimal heat
transfer material for the divertor heat exchanger. Methods have been
developed to create highly conductive thermal bonds between the porous
material and a solid substrate. Computational fluid dynamics
calculations of flow and heat transfer in the porous metal layer have
shown the capability of high thermal effectiveness. An 18-kW NFHX,
designed to meet specifications for the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor divertor, has been fabricated and tested for
thermal and flow performance. Preliminary results confirm design and
fabrication methods.

<i>Dennis L. Youchison, Michael G. Izenson, Chandu B. Baxi, John H. Rosenfeld</i>
<p>

High-heat-flux experiments on three types of helium-cooled divertor
mock-ups were performed on the 30-kW electron beam test system and its
associated helium flow loop at Sandia National Laboratories. A
dispersion-strengthened copper alloy (DSCu) was used in the
manufacture of all the mock-ups. The first heat exchanger was
manufactured by Creare, Inc., and makes use of microfin technology and
helium flow normal to the heated surface. This technology provides for
enhanced heat transfer at relatively low flow rates and much reduced
pumping requirements. The Creare sample was tested to a maximum
absorbed heat flux of 5.8 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. The second helium-cooled
divertor mock-up was designed and manufactured by General Atomics
(GA). It consisted of millimetre-sized axial fins and flow channels
machined in DSCu. This design used low pressure drops and high mass
flow rates to achieve good heat removal. The GA specimen was tested to
a maximum absorbed heat flux of 9 MW/m<sup>2</sup> while maintaining a
surface temperature below 400 <sup>o</sup>C. This temperature was
selected to be compatible with a 2-mm-thick beryllium tile at the
plasma interface, where the maximum surface temperature must be below
700 <sup>o</sup>C. A second experiment resulted in a maximum absorbed
heat flux of 34 MW/m<sup>2</sup> and surface temperatures near 533
<sup>o</sup>C. The third specimen was a DSCu, axial flow,
helium-cooled divertor mock-up filled with a porous metal wick
designed and manufactured by Thermacore, Inc. The internal porous
metal wick effectively increases the available heat transfer area. Low
mass flow and high pressure drop operation at 4.0 MPa were
characteristic of this divertor module. It survived a maximum absorbed
heat flux of 16 MW/m<sup>2</sup> and reached a surface temperature of
740 <sup>o</sup>C. Thermacore also manufactured a follow-on, dual
channel porous metal-type heat exchanger. This ``unit cell'' divertor
module was an improvement over the previous design because it utilized
short flow lengths to minimize pressure drops and pumping
requirements. It survived a maximum absorbed heat flux of 14
MW/m<sup>2</sup> and reached a maximum surface temperature of 690
<sup>o</sup>C.

<p>

Two vapotrons from the Joint European Torus (JET) actively cooled
divertor design have been fitted by the Japan Atomic Energy Research
Institute with unidirectional high-conductivity carbon-fiber-composite
tiles and have been tested in the JET Neutral Beam Test Bed. The test
section showed excellent uniformity and accepted power densities up to
30 MW/m<sup>2</sup> for equilibrium pulses. The surface temperature
was 1100 <sup>o</sup>C at 20 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. One tile detached at a
power density of 25 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. A total of just under 300 pulses
at power densities mostly between 20 and 30 MW/m<sup>2</sup> have been
fired onto the test sections without additional failure. The hydraulic
parameters were as follows: water inlet temperature, 15 to 20
<sup>o</sup>C; average water pressure in the component, 0.4 and 0.69
MPa; flow velocity, 6.9 and 7.5 m/s.

<a name=14><b>Performance of Hypervapotron Beam-Stopping Elements at JET</b><br></a>
<i>Hans-Dieter Falter, Ernest Thompson</i>
<p>

Rectangular Hypervapotron beam-stopping elements made from Cu-Cr-Zr
have been used in the Joint European Torus (JET) beam injectors to
dissipate up to 100 MW of power. Experience over more than 10 yr is
outstanding with not a single failure. At the flow velocities used in
the Hypervapotron elements of the JET injectors, the turbulence
created by the fins dominates the heat transfer, and the Hypervapotron
mechanism is of secondary importance. The main advantage of the
Hypervapotron is the geometrical flexibility. The surface can be
shaped freely as required without compromising on either heat transfer
or total power-handling capability. Flow velocity and flow rate can be
independently adjusted to requirements. Peak power densities up to 30
MW/m<sup>2</sup> were removed at a flow velocity of 7 m/s and a
pressure drop of 0.25 MPa/m. Flow parameters were as follows: velocity

<a name=15><b>Thermal Fatigue Testing of a Diffusion-Bonded Beryllium Divertor Mock-Up Under ITER-Relevant Conditions</b><br></a>
<i>Dennis L. Youchison, Radmir N. Guiniatouline, Robert D. Watson, Jimmie M. McDonald, David S. Walsh, V. I. Beloturov, Igor V. Mazul, Andrey P. Zakharov, Bernice E. Mills, Dale R. Boehme, Vladislav Ilich Savenko</i>
<p>

Thermal response and thermal fatigue tests of four 5-mm-thick
beryllium tiles on a Russian Federation International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER)-relevant divertor mock-up were completed
on the electron beam test system at Sandia National Laboratories. The
beryllium tiles were diffusion bonded onto an oxygen-free
high-conductivity copper saddleblock and a dispersion-strengthened
copper alloy tube containing a copper porous coating. Thermal response
tests were performed on the tiles to an absorbed heat flux of 5
MW/m<sup>2</sup> and surface temperatures near 300 <sup>o</sup>C using 1.4
MPa water at 5 m/s flow velocity and an inlet temperature of 8 to 15
<sup>o</sup>C. One tile was exposed to incrementally increasing heat
fluxes up to 9.5 MW/m<sup>2</sup> and surface temperatures up to 690
<sup>o</sup>C before debonding at 10 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. A second tile
debonded in 25 to 30 cycles at <0.5 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. However, a third
tile debonded after 9200 thermal fatigue cycles at 5 MW/m<sup>2</sup>,
while another debonded after 6800 cycles. Posttest surface analysis
indicated that fatigue failure occurred in the intermetallic layers
between the beryllium and copper. No fatigue cracking of the bulk
beryllium was observed. It appears that microcracks growing at the
diffusion bond produced the observed gradual temperature increases
during thermal cycling. These experiments indicate that
diffusion-bonded beryllium tiles can survive several thousand thermal
cycles under ITER-relevant conditions. However, the reliability of the
diffusion-bonded joint remains a serious issue.


<p>
<a name=16><b>Structural Design Codes: Strain-Life Method and Fatigue Damage Estimation for ITER</b><br></a>
<i>Panayiotis J. Karditsas</i>
<p>

A preferred route is suggested for implementing the design rules and
requirements of the design codes for the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER), such as ASME and RCC-MR, and for
preliminarily assessing which of the in-service loading conditions
inflicts the greatest damage on the structure.
<p>

The current ITER design schedule and possible construction time
require in the short term either enhancing the existing design codes
and procedures or developing new ones. The time involved in such
processes is great and, when coupled with the introduction of new
technology, requires adherence, as much as possible, to existing
design codes; any necessary modifications to the existing framework
must be minor. The rationale for using the rules for
strain-deformation and fatigue limits in the design and the reasons
why this method is thought to be the most appropriate for a device
like ITER are presented and analyzed.
<p>

Some of the relevant design code rules and constraints are presented,
and lifetime and fatigue damage, with some data on fatigue life for
Type 316 stainless steel, are predicted. A design curve for strain
range versus the number of cycles to failure is presented, including
the effect of neutron damage on the material.
<p>

An example calculation is performed on a first-wall section, and
preliminary estimation of the fatigue usage factor is presented. One
must observe caution when assessing the results because of the
assumptions made in performing the calculations. The results, however,
indicate that parts of the component are in the low-cycle fatigue
region of operation, which thus supports the use of strain-life
methods. The load-controlled stress limit approach of the existing
codes leads to difficulties with in-service loading and component
categorization, whereas the strain-deformation limit approach may lead
to difficulties in calculations. The conclusion is that the
load-controlled approach shifts the emphasis to the regulator and the
licensing body, whereas the strain-deformation approach shifts the
emphasis to the designer and the structural analyst.

<i>G. R. Longhurst, D. A. Petti, G. A. Dinneen, J. S. Herring, J. DeLooper, J. D. Levine, M. J. Gouge, D. J. Baker</i>
<p>

Two new U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) standards have been prepared
to assist in the design and regulation of magnetic fusion
facilities. They are DOE-STD-6002-96, ``Safety of Magnetic Fusion
Facilities--Requirements,'' and DOE-STD-6003-96 ``Safety of Magnetic
Fusion Facilities--Guidance.'' The first standard sets forth
requirements, mostly based on the Code of Federal Regulations, deemed
necessary for the safe design and operation of fusion facilities and a
set of safety principles to use in the design. The second standard
provides guidance on how to meet the requirements identified in
DOE-STD-6002-96. It is written specifically for a facility such as the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in the DOE
regulatory environment. As technical standards, they are applicable
only to the extent that compliance with these standards is included in
the contracts of the developers.

<a name=0><b>Inertial Fusion Driven by Intense Cluster Ion Beams</b><br></a>
<i>Claude Deutsch, Antoine Bret, Shalom Eliezer, Jose M. Martinez-Val, Naeem A. Tahir</i>
<p>

The present state of the art concerning the use of intense cluster ion
beams for driving an inertial fusion pellet containing a thermonuclear
fuel is reviewed. Emphasis is placed on the fragmentation and stopping
of correlated ion fragments in dense target material. The direct drive
approach is given a hydrodynamic as well as a full one-dimensional
simulation treatment. Indirect drive looks highly promising.


<p>
<a name=1><b>Design Risk Analysis Comparison Between Low-Activation Composite and Aluminum Alloy Target Chamber for the National Ignition Facility</b><br></a>
<i>Holger H. Streckert, Robert W. Schleicher</i>
<p>

The baseline design for the target chamber for the National Ignition
Facility (NIF) consists of an aluminum alloy spherical shell. A
low-activation composite chamber (e.g., carbon fiber/epoxy) has
important advantages such as enhanced environmental and safety
characteristics, improved chamber accessibility due to reduced
neutron-induced radioactivity, and elimination of the concrete
shield. However, it is critical to determine the design and
manufacturing risk for the first application. The replacement of such
a critical component requires a detailed development risk
assessment. A semiquantitative approach to risk assessment has been
applied to this problem based on failure modes, effects, and
criticality analysis. This analysis consists of a systematic method
for organizing the collective judgment of the designers to identify
failure modes, estimate probabilities, judge the severity of the
consequence, and illustrate risk in a matrix representation. The two
chamber designs are reduced to functional components where separate
failure mode and effects analyses and criticality analyses are applied
and incorporated into sets of worksheets. Criticality matrices are
subsequently constructed from the worksheets. The results of the
analyses indicate that the composite chamber has a reasonably high
probability of success in the NIF application. The aluminum alloy
chamber, however, represents a lower risk, partially based on a more
mature technology.


<p>
<a name=2><b>Radioactive Waste Disposal Characteristics of Candidate Tokamak Demonstration Reactors</b><br></a>
<i>Edward A. Hoffman, Weston M. Stacey, Nolan E. Hertel</i>
<p>

Results from the present physics, materials, and blanket research and
development programs are combined with physics and engineering design
constraints to characterize candidate tokamak demonstration plant
(DEMO) designs. Blanket designs based on the principal structural
materials, breeding materials, and coolants being developed for the
DEMO were adapted from the literature. Neutron flux and activation
calculations were performed, and several radioactive waste disposal
indexes were evaluated for each design. Of the primary low-activation
structural materials under development in the United States, it
appears that vanadium and ferritic steel alloys and possibly silicon
carbide could lead to DEMO designs that could satisfy realistic
low-level waste (LLW) criteria, provided that impurities can be
controlled within plausible limits. Allowable LLW concentrations are
established for the limiting alloying and impurity elements. All
breeding materials and neutron multipliers considered meet the LLW
criterion.


<p>
<a name=3><b>Consistency of the Biphasic Nature of Excess Enthalpy in Solid-State Anomalous Phenomena with the Quasi-One-Dimensional Model of Isotope Loading into a Material</b><br></a>
<i>Mitchell R. Swartz</i>
<p>

Electrochemical experiments, using nickel cathodes in light water
solutions, were used to examine the enthalpy generated by electrically
driving each electrode pair compared with ohmic controls contained
within the same solution. For nickel wire cathodes, the peak power
amplification (<img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/pi.gif"><sub>Ni</sub>) was in the range of
1.44<img src="/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif">0.58. For
spiral-wound nickel cathodes with platinum foil anodes, <img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/pi.gif"><sub>Ni</sub> was 2.27<img
src="/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif">1.02. By contrast, neither
iron nor aluminum cathodes demonstrated excess heat.  <p>

Driving these nickel samples beyond several volts, however, produced
an exponential falloff of the power gain. This biphasic response to
increasing input power may be consistent with the
quasi-one-dimensional model of isotope loading and may contribute to
the difficulty of reproducing these phenomena.


<p>
<a name=4><b>An Experimental Investigation of the Efficiency of HTO Reduction by Zr-Fe-Mn Getter Alloy</b><br></a>
<i>Francesco Ghezzi, Walter T. Shmayda, Giovanni Bonizzoni</i>
<p>

Tritium gas handling involves the production of tritiated water, which
is 10,000 times more hazardous than tritium gas. If tritium emission
to the environment must be minimized, the need to process tritiated
water and recover the chemically bound tritium appears
clear. Facilities for processing tritiated water produced in fission
reactors are already available, while facilities for a
deuterium-tritium fusion machine are under development. However, these
facilities are intended for large-scale applications and are neither
practical nor economical for small-scale applications. HTO vapor
reduction to HT over a hot metal getter other than uranium offers a
simple, safe, and economical solution. A high alloy capacity and
conversion rate combined with a low tritium residual inventory in the
exhausted alloy make this method attractive. An experimental
investigation of the efficiency of reducing HTO by a Zr-Fe-Mn alloy is
presented. The results, obtained by three independent diagnostics
(stripper set, ionization chambers, and mass spectrometry), show that
for gas residence times &gt;1 s and alloy temperatures
&gt;400<sup>o</sup>C, a conversion efficiency exceeding 90 134672392s
achievable. Specific conversion rates &gt;0.1 <img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/mu.gif">mol/s<img alt=""

the alloy usage, while a capacity of the alloy, measured as an
oxygen-to-alloy mole ratio, &gt;2.6 has been measured.


<p>
<a name=5><b>Traveling-Wave Antenna for Fast-Wave Heating and Current Drive in Tokamaks</b><br></a>
<i>H. Ikezi, D. A. Phelps</i>
<p>

The traveling-wave antenna for heating and current drive in the ion
cyclotron range of frequencies is shown theoretically to have loading
and wavenumber spectra that are largely independent of plasma
conditions. These characteristics have been demonstrated in low-power
experiments on the DIII-D tokamak, in which a standard four-strap
antenna was converted to a traveling-wave antenna through use of
external coupling elements. The experiments indicate that the array
maintains good impedance matching without dynamic tuning during abrupt
changes in the plasma, such as during L- to H-mode transitions,
edge-localized mode activity, and disruptions. An analytic model was
developed that exhibits the features observed in the
experiments. Guidelines for the design of traveling-wave antennas are
derived from the validated model.

<i><b>"U.S. Seeking to Strengthen Nuclear Agency" </b><br>
NEW YORK TIMES, 6/4/96, p. A11</i><br>
Raymond Bonner
<p>

A US-backed plan to strengthen the powers of the International Atomic
Energy Agency "has run into determined resistance, not from rogue
states bent on acquiring nuclear arsenals, but from two allies --
Germany and Japan -- that fear a new burden on their flourishing
nuclear power industries."
<p>

The NEW YORK TIMES reports from Vienna that a majority of nations seem
to support a stronger IAEA.  The agency's proposed new powers would
enable it to make more thorough inspections and require "more detailed
reports" from operators of nuclear power plants, especially about the
imports and exports of nuclear- weapons related material.  The
government cites continuing concerns about the nuclear ambitions of
countries like Iraq and North Korea.
<p>

But a "senior German diplomat" said the expanded powers being sought
for the agency would give its inspectors "more legal rights to search
private property than a German police officer has."  And he said
owners of private nuclear plants are opposed to filing more reports
and having more inspectors.
<p>

Makoto Yamanaka, a senior Japanese diplomat, said the burden of
nuclear inspections is already greater on japan than most countries
becuase of its large nuclear industry.  The US representative to the
UN in Vienna conceded that Germany and Japan would face greater
burdens under the proposal.  But he said, "The enormous benefits to
global security from deterring, or at least detecting, a future Saddam
Hussein, overwhelm the modest burdens involved."

<i><b>"Nuclear Watchdog Agency Shows Signs of Bite" </b><br>
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, 6/4/96, p. 1</i><br>
Peter Spotts
<p>

The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission "has worked relatively well over
the years," judging by the safety record of the US nuclear power
industry.  But a review of NRC documents, as well as conversations
with inspectors and "industry insiders" suggests the agency "may
indeed have problems," reports the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR in a
lengthy, page-one feature with photos and a map of "Nuclear Plants to
Watch."  Critics say there is even "a growing danger of another
serious nuclear accident."
<p>

Among several problems, the MONITOR's investigation identified 
these:
<ul>
  <li> NRC inspectors may be "too willing to take a utility's word"
       that it is addressing problems; 
  <li> "Higher-level" NRC officials "sometimes downgrade the severity
       of safety problems" discovered by inspectors "without giving
       reasons for the change";
  <li> NRC inspectors who press safety issues "have been subjected to
       harassment and intimidation by their supervisors."
</ul>
<p>

"What critics find particularly troubling" is that the demoralized
NRC's problems come as the industry prepares to deal with uncertainty
stemming from deregulation of power markets and aging facilities.
Industry consultant David Lochbaum even compares the situation today
to that of NASA and the space industry at the time of the 1986
Challenger accident.
<p>

"Utility executives acknowledge the challenges ahead," the MONITOR
reports.  "But they dismiss concerns that plants are being pushed
beyond safe limits" and point to statistics that show all of the
industry's safety trends are heading in the right direction.
<p>

The article continues with references to specific performance issues
at Entergy's nuclear plants in the South and the Wolf Creek plant in
Kansas.  The map shows the location of US nuclear plants with four on
the NRC's "Watch List" highlighted: Dresden in Illinois, Browns Ferry
in Alabama, Indian Point in New York and Millstone in Connecticut.

<i><b>"Point Beach Nuclear Plant Update"</b><br>
WISCONSIN ELECTRIC PRESS RELEASE, 5/31/96 Contact:</i><br>
Mary carpenter, 414-221-4444
<p>

Wisconsin Electric and a six-member team from the US Nuclear
Regulatory Commission are reviewing the circumstances that led to the
ignition of hydrogen gas during welding on a spent-fuel storage
container at Point Beach nuclear plant on 5/28.
<p>

In a press release last week, the Citizens Utility Board group
characterized the incident as an "explosion" at the Point Beach
nuclear- waste storage facility.  But the utility says the gas burn
"produced enough force to move the shield lid slightly while the lid
was being mechanically welded to the container."  No radiation was
released during the incident, the utility says.
<p>

Wisconsin Electric VP Bob Link said spent-fuel assemblies had been
removed from the container and inspected, and no damage was found,
demonstrating a "high level of safety" built into the containers and
the process for loading them.
<p>

The NRC team, which will be on-site until the end of the week, will 
prepare a findings report, and the utility will not resume loading 
until it can identify the source of the hydrogen and take corrective 
measures.

<i><b>"N.Y. and New England May Run Short of Power"</b><br>
PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 6/1/96, p. D1</i><br>
Sue Fernandez
<p>

A recent study undertaken by the North American Electric Reliability
Council, an industry-financed research group, found that New England
and New York are "in greatest danger of voltage reductions and other
power-supply disruptions" this summer.  But barring sudden storms,
extreme heat or technical breakdowns, the rest of the nation most
likely will not experience those types of disruptions.
<p>

On average, the US is carrying a power reserve equal to 25% of the
average use for June through September.  But New England is down to a
reserve of about 12%, mostly because of the shutdown of the Millstone
nuclear power plant in Connecticut.  The PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER writes
that while Millstone's closing most directly affects New England, it
may have repercussions on the entire Northeast.
<p>

In the Southeast, the Olympic Games being held in Atlanta are expected
to increase regional power demand in July by 600 megawatts, but
Georgia Power Co. officials say they are have prepared to meet the
extra demand.  Georgia Power vice president William Archer: "Georgia
Power's strategy ... will be a combination of buy, borrow and save."

<i><b>"Closing of Nuclear Plants Opposed Despite Problems"</b><br>
HARTFORD COURANT, 5/30/96, p. A3</i><br>
Mike McIntire and Michael Remez
<p>

"Despite nagging concerns about safety at Connecticut's nuclear power
plants, a majority of state residents surveyed do not want the plants
closed if it means paying higher electric bills," reports the HARTFORD
COURANT.
<p>

The telephone poll of 500 randomly selected adults, conducted May 10
to May 18 by the Institute for Social Inquiry at the U. of
Connecticut, surveyed residents on their attitudes concerning several
issues related to the nuclear industry, including those related to
Northeast Utilities' Millstone Nuclear Power Complex in Waterford,
CT. The survey's authors found that most people's perceptions of
nuclear safety are complicated -- "and sometimes contradictory."
<p>

Forty-nine percent of the survey's participants said they see the
problems at Millstone as mostly technical in nature, while only 25%
thought they were "real safety problems."  Also, 79% of respondents
said they didn't worry very much about the possibility of a major
accident at a nuclear plant.
<p>

On the other hand, 49% of survey participants said they think a
serious nuclear accident is a "real possibility" in the state, and 58%
would be very concerned to live near a nuclear plant -- as opposed to
47% who would fear neighboring a maximum- security prison.
<p>

Northeast Utilities said the findings are consistent with what the
company has discovered in its own polling.  The Courant/Connecticut
poll has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.

Associated Press
<p>

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on May 30 announced that an
independent team will take a comprehensive look at operations at Maine
Yankee nuclear power plant in Wiscasset, ME.  The probe will follow up
an earlier review that was described as weak and inadequate.
<p>

The Independent Safety Assessment team will evaluate the licensing and
operational safety performance at the plant, develop a work plan by
June 9 and should submit a report in about 16 weeks.

BATON ROUGE ADVOCATE, 5/30/96, p. 7A</i><br>
Marsha Shuler
<p>

The Louisiana Senate Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Committee on May 29
defeated a proposed constitutional amendment which would have spread
tax revenues from nuclear powerplants among the state's 46 parishes
whose residents get electricity from the Entergy-Louisiana Power and
Light facilities.
<p>

The Senate panel agreed with bill opponents such as St. Charles
parish, who said that it was unfair to take the taxes away from
parishes that agreed to house nuclear plants at a time when the idea
was looked upon unfavorably.
<p>

Jefferson Parish Council President Aaron Broussard, who pushed for the
defeated tax distribution plan said the public will notice the change
when they see their utility bills start to climb in July to make up
for the taxes to be paid to St. Charles.

<i><b>"Off Base"</b><br>
NEWSWEEK, 6/3/96 Issue, p. A3</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

"Even interim solutions to the disposal of nuclear waste are plagued
by political wrangling," NEWSWEEK reports.
<p>

The nuclear-power industry is pushing for legislation in Congress to
allow shipments of nuclear waste across Nevada for temporary storage
at Yucca Mountain.  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act would establish two
interim storage facilities near Yucca Mtn. -- the proposed permanent
storage site -- for spent fuel from civilian and military reactors.
<p>

But an "unlikely" alliance, including the "anti-nuke" lobby, Nevada
and the US Air Force is opposing the act.  Planned waste shipment
routes run through the training range at Nellis Air Force Base, and
USAF officials warn that any interruption in flights over the area
could threaten national security.  Bob Loux of Nevada's nuclear waste
office: "Fighter bombers with live ordnance and nuclear waste spells
conflict in my mind."
<p>

Senate floor action is expected on the Nuclear Waste Policy Act later
this summer.

<i>Ian H. Hutchinson, Steve F. Horne, Gerasimos Tinios, Stephen M. Wolfe, Robert S. Granetz</i>
<p>

A general approach to plasma shape control and its application to the
Alcator C-Mod tokamak are described. The method is linear in the
magnetic measurements but is entirely algorithmic, requiring no
fitting of databases. Estimators of the shape parameters are based on
a complete vacuum reconstruction of the flux, so that control points
can be defined anywhere within the reconstructed region. The
conversion of flux differences into flux-surface distances and the
calculation of appropriate coil currents for controlling each
parameter require a specific reference equilibrium. However, the
control is very insensitive to the choice of reference equilibrium
provided that the shape parameters are chosen appropriately. Control
current combinations that are orthogonal, in the sense of changing one
parameter and not the others, are obtained. Experiments with these
estimators and controllers show them to be accurate and robust over a
wide range of plasma shapes.
<p>


<a name=3><b>Advancing Plasma Control on the Princeton Beta Experiment Modification</b><br></a>
<i>Ronald E. Bell, Ronald E. Hatcher, Lawrence J. Lagin, Michio Okabayashi, Paul Sichta</i>
<p>

A digital plasma control system for the Princeton Beta Experiment
Modification (PBX-M) is being prepared. The functions of the existing
analog shape and position control subsystems will be assumed by the
upgraded control system. Plasma profile control will be pursued by
making use of the lower hybrid current drive and the ion Bernstein
wave heating systems to modify the plasma current and pressure
profiles. A framework for integrating these plasma control functions
is presented. Existing profile diagnostics can, with some
modification, provide the information necessary to feed back on the
plasma profiles. The digital control hardware is commercially
available. Four real-time processors, which can be programmed
independently, reside on a single Versa Module Eurocard board with
dedicated shared memory. The parallel programming capability allows
the separation by function of the vertical position control, shaping
control, and profile control, which have different characteristic
timescales.
<p>


<a name=4><b>Fluctuations in Plasma Equilibrium Control on JT-60U</b><br></a>
<i>Ryuji Yoshino, Masaya Ohsawa</i>
<p>

Experimental analyses are presented of fluctuations observed in a
plasma-current-center, I<sub>p</sub>-center, location and the inward
clearance between the outermost flux surface and the first wall at
plasma perturbations (e.g., <img alt=""
src="/graphics/symbols/beta.gif"><sub>p</sub> collapse and disruption)
for JT-60U divertor plasmas. The neutral point for vertical and
horizontal movement of the I<sub>p</sub> center at plasma disturbances
is confirmed, and attachment of the plasma to the inward first wall is
avoided because of the increase in l<sub>i</sub> at fast
plasma-current quench. These experimental observations will support
the design of fusion reactors like the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER).  <p>


<a name=5><b>Plasma Current, Shape, and Position Control in ITER</b><br></a>
<i>Raffaele Albanese, Giuseppe Ambrosino, Enzo Coccorese, Francesco Carlo Morabito, Alfredo Pironti, Guglielmo Rubinacci, Stefano Scala</i>
<p>

A linear model for feedback control of the plasma position and shape
in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is
discussed. A model of the poloidal field (PF) system and of the
disturbances is first derived. The main task of the control system is
to avoid any contact of the hot plasma with the wall during the long
duration of the burn phase. For this purpose, the control variables
are specified as six gaps between the plasma separatrix and the first
wall, including divertor channels.
<p>

The structure model includes PF coils, vacuum vessel, first wall,
backplate, and divertor fins, and it refers to the TAC-4 outline
design ITER geometry. A multivariable controller is designed using the
optimal linear quadratic approach.
<p>

The simulation of the closed-loop system shows how the plasma shape is
recovered: Step gap variations of 15 cm and poloidal beta drops of 0.2
are considered as disturbances. The performance parameters are
voltages and currents in the PF coils and gap recovery time; voltage
saturation of the actuators is also taken into account.

<p>

Control of the poloidal field (PF) in the Tokamak Physics Experiment
(TPX) is critical to achieving its mission of advanced tokamak
research. Extensive examination of the plasma equilibrium; plasma
start-up; plasma position, shape, and current control; and plasma
shape reconstruction have been performed as part of the design
process. This paper reports the progress in this area. The PF coils
have been designed to produce a wide range of plasmas. Plasma start-up
can be achieved for multiple conditions. Fast plasma position control
coils inside the vacuum vessel are used for short timescale control of
the plasma vertical and radial position. Shape and total
plasma-current control are provided by the PF coils over a slower
timescale. A new algorithm for shape control of a few critical plasma
boundary points is described and used in simulations using the Tokamak
Simulation Code. Fast magnetostatic reconstruction of the plasma shape
is examined to determine the impact of measurement locations and their
quality.

<a name=7><b>Comparison of Models to Experiment for the Purposes of Axisymmetric Control in Alcator C-Mod</b><br></a>
<i>Gerasimos Tinios, Steve F. Horne, Ian H. Hutchinson, Stephen M. Wolfe</i>
<p>

Linear control models are tested against experimental data from the
Alcator C-Mod tokamak. A nonrigid, approximately flux-conserving,
perturbed equilibrium plasma response model is used, together with a
detailed toroidally symmetric model of the conducting vacuum vessel
and the supporting superstructure, and experimentally determined power
supply responses. Experiments are conducted with vertically unstable
plasmas where the feedback is turned off and the plasma response is
observed in an open-loop configuration. The agreement between theory
and experiment is found to be very satisfactory, proving that the
perturbed equilibrium plasma response model and a toroidally symmetric
electromagnetic model of the vacuum vessel and the structure can be
trusted for the purposes of calculations for control law design. The
closed-loop behavior is also examined by injecting step perturbations
into the desired vertical position of the plasma. The control hardware
introduces nonlinearities that make it difficult to explain observed
behavior with linear theory. Nonlinear simulation of the time
evolution of the closed-loop experiments is able to account for the
discrepancies between linear theory and experiment. Satisfactory
agreement is then obtained between the model including the full
multiple input/multiple output control system and the experimental
observations.

<a name=8><b>Identification of Plasma Equilibria in ITER from Magnetic Measurements Via Functional Parameterization and Neural Networks</b><br></a>
<i>Raffaele Albanese, Enzo Coccorese, Otto Gruber, Raffaele Martone, Patrick McCarthy, Francesco Carlo Morabito</i>
<p>

Real-time control of the plasma shape in the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) calls for a fast and
accurate identification of the equilibrium starting from magnetic
measurements. The technique proposed for ITER interpolates the actual
equilibrium within a previously generated dataset where each parameter
is given a sufficiently wide range of variation. The properties of the
artificial neural networks (ANNs) are shown to be well suited for this
task. The satisfactory comparison with the functional
parameterization, which is currently adopted for the feedback control
in ASDEX-Upgrade, makes the proposed technique well linked to the
experience available in current experiments.
<p>

The ANN technique also provides an algorithm for the selection of the
number and location of the magnetic sensors, which is an important
issue for the ITER design. A preliminary analysis of the effects of
the eddy currents flowing in the structure is also included. Numerical
results presented refer to the so-called TAC-4 ITER geometry;
extrapolation to update geometries with a close poloidal field concept
is straightforward.

<p>

A high toroidal eddy current induced in a vacuum vessel during
plasma-current quench, I<sub>p</sub> quench, results in errors in
determining the vertical position of the plasma-current center,
Z<sub>J</sub>, calculated from standard linear regression sensor
algorithms. These deviations result in a vertical displacement event
(VDE) that must be avoided because of the expected severe damage on
the first wall in tokamak fusion reactors like the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). On the other hand, high
Z<sub>J</sub> calculation accuracy must be maintained at steady state
to obtain reasonable plasma performance. Thus, real-time sensor
algorithms for the calculation of Z<sub>J</sub> applicable to the two
cases of steady state and slow I<sub>p</sub> quench are
investigated. When a statistical method is applied to the
Z<sub>J</sub> calculation, its deviation from the actual Z<sub>J</sub>
cannot be completely reduced at the same time for both cases. On the
contrary, a neural network demonstrate s high accuracy in the
calculation of Z<sub>J</sub> for both cases, which enables real-time
feedback control of Z<sub>J</sub> during slow I<sub>p</sub> quench,
avoids VDE, and keeps reasonable plasma performance during steady
state.

<p>

Disruptions on the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR), especially
those occurring at high stored energy, result in lost experimental run
time because many discharges are required to regain wall conditions
necessary for good plasma performance. A variety of disruption types
have been observed on TFTR. These include density-limit disruptions,
those caused by a high influx of impurities, those occurring during
the current rampdown, those resulting from locked modes, and those
occurring at high normalized <img alt=""

<a name=11><b>Some Experiments on the Decrease of Tritium Radioactivity</b><br></a>
<i>Otto J. A. Reifenschweiler</i>
<p>

Experiments claiming a sharp decrease in the radioactivity of tritium
incorporated in small monocrystalline particles of titanium have been
reported and are described here in more detail. Additional evaluation
provides a high degree of evidence for the decrease in the
radioactivity of tritium. A first attempt is made to explain this
remarkable effect in terms of a ``nuclear pair hypothesis.''

<i>R. K. Rout, A. Shyam, M. Srinivasan, A. B. Garg, V. K. Shrikhande</i>
<p>

Each and every palladium sample loaded/reloaded either with hydrogen
or deuterium was observed to fog radiographic films kept in its close
proximity in air. Strangely, even with ten layers of black paper
(thickness ~63 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) as a filter between film and sample,
fogging was observed. On the other hand, no fogging could be observed
even when thin beryllium foil (~1.4 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), three layers
of transparent polyester foils (~10 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), or thin
aluminized polycarbonate (0.3 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) were employed as
filters. Several experiments have been performed to identify the
phenomenon responsible for fogging. These experiments appear to rule
out any of the known mechanisms, suggesting a new, strange, and
unknown phenomena.  <p>


<a name=13><b>An Investigation of Anomalous Thermal Power Generation from a Proton-Conducting Oxide</b><br></a>
<i>R. A. Oriani</i>
<p>

A high-temperature Seebeck-effect calorimeter, in which the
thermoelectric electromotive force across a large-area-enveloping
thermopile is a measure of the heat flux from a power source, has been
constructed to examine the claimed generation of excess thermal energy
from a proton-conducting oxide immersed in deuterium gas. The claim
has been confirmed in a few experiments out of many unsuccessful ones.

<a name=0><b>Edge Exposure of Poloidal Divertor Target Plate Tiles</b><br></a>
<i>Roma B. Mohanti, John G. Gilligan, Mohamed A. Bourham</i>
<p>

RMDNM-Exposure to near normal surfaces of poloidal divertor target
plate tiles is a limiting feature of the power handling capability of
the tiles. The problems associated with the design of poloidal
divertor tiles, with beryllium chosen as the tile material, and
possible methods of solving the problem are discussed. Thermal two-
and three-dimensional analyses are carried out for the assessment of
relative merits in performance due to modifications to the
surface. The power handling capability (time to reach melting
temperature of beryllium) of the target plate tiles is presented for
unswept and swept plasma cases. Results have shown that sweeping the
plasma improves the power handling capability by a factor of up to 10.
<p>


<a name=1><b>Spheromak Experiment Using Separate Guns for Formation and Sustainment</b><br></a>
<i>Michael R. Brown, Adam Martin</i>
<p>

RMDNM-An experiment is described that incorporates the use of separate
magnetized plasma guns for formation and sustainment of a
spheromak. It is shown that energy coupling efficiency approaches
unity if the gun and spheromak are of comparable size. A large gun
should be able to operate at lower current and therefore lower
voltage. In addition, it is expected that a gun matched to the size of
the spheromak will cause less perturbation to the equilibrium. It is
proposed to use a smaller gun for spheromak formation and a large,
efficient gun for sustainment. The theoretical basis for the
experiment is developed, and the details of the experiment are
described. A prediction of the equilibrium magnetic flux surfaces
using the EFIT code is presented.
<p>


<a name=2><b>Submegajoule Liner Implosion of a Closed Field Line Configuration</b><br></a>
<i>R. Paul Drake, James H. Hammer, Charles W. Hartman, L. John Perkins, Dimitri D. Ryutov</i>
<p>

RMDNM-Adiabatic compression of a preformed closed field line
configuration by an imploding liner is considered. Three
configurations are discussed: the field-reversed configuration, the
spheromak, and the Z-pinch. It is shown that by employing a
two-dimensional compression, one can reach a breakeven condition with
an energy input into the plasma as low as 100 kJ. Typical initial
dimensions of the liner are length, 5 to 6 cm; radius,
RMDBO-|RMDNM-P51 cm; and wall thickness, RMDBO-|RMDNM-P50.01 cm. Liner
mass is in the range of a few grams. It is assumed that the initial
plasma beta is of the order of unity; in this case, the final beta is
much greater than 1, and the plasma is in a wall confinement
regime. Typical plasma parameters for the final state (for the linear
compression ratio equal to 10) are density, 10<sup>21</sup>
cm<sup>-3</sup>; temperature, 10 keV; and magnetic field, 10<sup>7</sup>
G. A brief discussion of various phenomena affecting the wall
confinement is presented (magnetic field diffusion, ra diative losses,
and impurity penetration); the conclusion is drawn that the heat
losses to the walls are modest and are not a factor that limits plasma
enhancement Q. It is shown that at least for relatively thin liners,
whose compressibility can be neglected, what limits Q is a relatively
short liner dwell time near the maximum compression point. The scaling
law for the Q versus the input parameters of the system is derived,
which shows a relatively weak dependence of Q on the input
energy. Possible ways for increasing the dwell time are
discussed. Reactor potentialities of the system are briefly
described. It is emphasized that the possibility of performing crucial
experiments on small- to medium-scale experimental devices may
considerably shorten the development path for the system under
consideration. Some nonfusion applications of the system described are
mentioned. Among them are burning and transmutation of long-lived
fusion products, medical isotope production, a pulsed source of hard X
rays, and fusion neutrons.
<p>


<a name=3><b>Correlation Measurements for Fusion Plasma Diagnostics</b><br></a>
<i>Imre Pazsit</i>
<p>

RMDNM-Fluctuation analysis of various physical parameters, mainly
neutron flux or other radiation, has long been used for the
diagnostics of both fission and fusion reactors. However, it appears
that there has been relatively little exchange of information
regarding research in the two fields. Some noise diagnostic methods
used in fission reactors that may have some relevance for or
resemblance to fusion plasma diagnostics are described, and this may
contribute to the exchange between the two areas. An example is given
to illustrate the possibility of such a transfer of
experience. Namely, a method is described, taken from experience with
fission reactor technology, that has been suggested for fusion
applications. The method is used in general for nonintrusive
determination of the correlation length of density fluctuations by
spectral and correlation analysis. It can be applied to the analysis
of plasma soft X rays for investigation of turbulence and
magnetohydrodynamic effects. The proposed method has been partially
tested on data from the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak.
<p>


<a name=4><b>Optimal Design of an Isotope Separation System</b><br></a>
<i>Laurence Boisset, Christian Latge, Luc Pibouleau, Phillippe Guittard, Serge Domenech</i>
<p>

RMDNM-Cryogenic distillation cascades are proposed to be used today to
separate hydrogen isotopes in the fuel cycle of a fusion reactor. It
is necessary to design these cascades so that their tritium inventory
is minimal. We have thus developed optimization tools in order to
simultaneously optimize the structure and the operating parameters of
these distillation sequences. This leads to the implementation of a
mixed-integer nonlinear programming procedure in a process simulator.
<p>

The application concerns the International Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor (ITER) isotope separation system. Successive simulation and
optimization studies have been carried out which show the accuracy of
the simulation and lead to the suggestion of a new arrangement of
units for the cascade, with a higher number of columns.

<a name=5><b>Investigation of Low-Level Tritium Generation in Ni-H<sub>2</sub>O Electrolytic Cells</b><br></a>
<i>T. K. Sankaranarayanan, Mahadeva Srinivasan, Mukut Behari Bajpai, Devendra Swarup Gupta</i>
<p>

RMDNM-The generation of tritium during the electrolysis of aqueous
light water alkali carbonate (K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and
Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) solutions by nickel cathodes, first
reported by us at the International Conference on Cold Fusion-3
(Nagoya, Japan, October 1992) has once again been verified and
confirmed. During 1993, 10 out of 23 cells, whose electrolytes were
analyzed using a newly set up dedicated liquid scintillation counting
unit, indicated low tritium levels in the electrolyte, in the range of
0.5 to 4.8 Bq/ml. Except one cell, which contained 25% D<sub>2</sub>O,
the remaining nine cells, which produced tritium, were charged with
natural light water solutions only. Two of these cells, which were
monitored for tritium every few days, and excluding cell OM-3, which
was set up in 1992, indicated tritium level variations in a sawtooth
fashion, suggesting the possible presence of an as yet unidentified
mechanism responsible for periodically removing tritium from the
electrolyte.

<a name=6><b>Computer Experiments Concerning Palladium-Deuterium and Titanium-Deuterium Lattices--Implications to Phenomenon of Cold Fusion</b><br></a>
<i>K. R. Rao, Samrath Lal Chaplot</i>
<p>

RMDNM-Short-lived large energy fluctuations (SLEFs) in solids,
proposed by Khait, are known to be responsible for several anomalous
properties in a variety of materials. The study of SLEFs in
palladium-deuterium and titanium-deuterium lattices via computer
experiments is reported. The relevance of these large energy
fluctuations in penetrating coulombic barriers in these systems is
discussed. Such dynamical effects arising from the phonon bath in
solids may enhance nuclear reaction probabilities leading to cold
fusion. Expected cold fusion reaction rates are reported taking into
account the effective charges of the deuterium atoms in the solid and
SLEF frequencies.
<p>


<a name=7><b>Coupling of Electromagnetics and Structural/Fluid Dynamics--Application to the Dual Coolant Blanket Subjected to Plasma Disruptions</b><br></a>
<i>Thomas Jordan</i>
<p>

RMDNM-Some aspects concerning the coupling of quasi-stationary
electromagnetics and the dynamics of structure and fluid are
investigated. The necessary equations are given in a dimensionless
form. The dimensionless parameters in these equations are used to
evaluate the importance of the different coupling effects.
<p>

A finite element formulation of the eddy-current damping in solid
structures is developed. With this formulation, an existing finite
element method (FEM) structural dynamics code is extended and coupled
to an FEM eddy-current code. With this program system, the influence
of the eddy-current damping on the dynamic loading of the dual coolant
blanket during a centered plasma disruption is determined. The
analysis proves that only in loosely fixed or soft structures will
eddy-current damping considerably reduce the resulting
stresses. Additionally, the dynamic behavior of the liquid metal in
the blankets' poloidal channels is described with a simple
two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic approach.
<p>

The analysis of the dimensionless parameters shows that for
small-scale experiments, which are designed to model the coupled
electromagnetic and structural/fluid dynamic effects in such a
blanket, the same magnetic fields must be applied as in the real
fusion device. This will be the easiest way to design experiments that
produce transferable results.
<p>


<a name=8><b>Analytical Solutions of the Boltzmann Transport Equation for Light Ion Reflection</b><br></a>
<i>Jovan Vukanic, Rodoljub Simovic</i>
<p>

RMDNM-Reflection of light ions from solids have been calculated in the
low-energy region where large-angle multiple collisions
dominate. Backscattering parameters are obtained as a solution of the
Boltzmann equation in the transport approximation. The Laplace
transformed equation, which has the form of a one-group transport
equation for isotropic scattering, has been solved by using an
accurate analytical approximation of Chandrasekhar's
H-function. Universal curves as well as analytical results are
presented for reflected energy spectra integrated over all ejection
angles, particle and energy reflection coefficients, and total angular
distribution of backscattered ions. Calculations have been done for
different angles of incidence. For normal ion incidence and primary
energies higher than 100 eV, the agreement between analytical theory
and computer simulation data is satisfactory.

to atomic fractions up to 0.7. Most of the experimental runs show no

Opportunities</b></a><br>

<i>E. Bickford Hooper, James H. Hammer, Cris W. Barnes, Juan
C. Fernandez, Fred J. Wysocki</i>
<p>

The results of spheromak experiments are re-examined in light of the
hypothesis that the core energy confinement is considerably better
than the global confinement and that it extrapolates favorably with
magnetic Reynolds number S. The data in decaying spheromaks are found
to be consistent with the hypothesis and with magnetic fluctuations
scaling as S<sup>-1/2</sup> and determining the electron thermal
conductivity. No conclusion is drawn from the data for sustained
spheromaks, indicating the importance of a new experiment to determine
core energy confinement while helicity is injected. The
characteristics of such an experiment are discussed, including the
importance of using modern vacuum and wall-conditioning techniques and
of minimizing magnetic field errors.
<p>


<a name="2"><b>Theoretical Aspects of Energy Confinement in
Spheromaks</b></a><br>
<i>T. Kenneth Fowler</i>
<p>

Despite the poor global energy confinement observed in spheromak
experiments to date, the long-term prospects may be favorable as
spheromaks are scaled to larger size and higher temperatures. The
present performance is traced to excessive magnetic energy loss at the
edge compared to tokamaks and heat transport due to magnetic
fluctuations, both of which should scale away as the temperature
increases.

<a name="4"><b>Plasma Exhaust Purification by Thermal Swing
Adsorption: Experimental Results and Modeling</b></a><br>
<i>I. Ricapito, C. Malara</i>
<p>

For several years at the Joint Research Centre-Ispra laboratories,
cyclic adsorption processes have been developed for the purification
of the plasma exhaust stream of a deuterium-tritium fusion reactor. A
purification process consisting of two coupled thermal swing
adsorption systems seemed to be the most convenient process.
<p>

In this context, a screening study was carried out to select the most
suitable adsorbent materials and appropriate working
temperatures. This was mainly done by experimental measurements of
adsorption isotherms of the single components of the plasma exhaust
stream and by a careful evaluation of the multicomponent adsorption
equilibria.
<p>

Experiments on adsorption dynamics were carried out in a pilot plant
to demonstrate the feasibility and to evaluate the performance of the
process. The experimental apparatus was designed to treat gas mixture
flow rates up to 20 to 30 standard temperature and pressure <i>l</i>/h.
<p>

A mathematical model was developed and tested against the experimental
results to describe the adsorption process and, in particular, to
evaluate and to optimize the process cycle time.
<p>


<a name="5"><b>A Control Method for the Cryogenic Distillation Column with a
Feedback Stream</b></a><br>
<i>Toshihiko Yamanishi, Mikio Enoeda, Kenji Okuno, Robert
H. Sherman</i>
<p>

A control method was proposed for the cryogenic distillation column
with a feedback stream. The top and bottom flow rates of the column
are adjusted for the variation of external feed composition to control
product purity. The flow rate of the side stream and the power of the
reboiler heater are promptly and linearly changed with the
corresponding variation of external feed flow rate. Ordinary columns
with no feedback stream are first-order lag systems for the case where
the top flow rate is chosen as a manipulated variable. On the other
hand, the column with a feedback stream is a second-order lag system
even in this case. The parameter-setting method of the
proportional-integral (PI) controller was proposed to predict the
unstable region in the control of the column. The method can also be
applied to the case where the measurement of the controlled variable
is accompanied by a long time lag. However, the longer time lag
requires a larger integral time, and the larger integra!  l time
brings a larger overshoot and slower damping for the controlled
variable. For this case, the promptness of the control can be improved
by introducing the PI derivative controller.

<h5>SYSTEMS</h5>

<a name="6"><b>Collisionless Diffusion of Particles and Current Across
a Magnetic Field in Beam/Plasma Interaction</b></a><br>
<i>G. Manfredi, M. Shoucri, I. Shkarofsky, A. Ghizzo, P. Bertrand,
E. Fijalkow, M. Feix, S. Karttunen, T. Pattikangas, R. Salomaa</i>
<p>

A drift-kinetic Eulerian Vlasov code with fluid equations for the ions
is used to study the collisionless diffusion of particles and current
across a magnetic field for the case of an electron beam injected near
the edge of a two-dimensional magnetized plasma slab. The case of a
magnetic field tilted with respect to the beam direction at an angle
of <img src=/graphics/symbols/theta.gif> = 10 deg
is considered. Test particles diagnostic techniques are used to study
the evolution of the phase space at different locations across the
plasma slab. We analyze the anomalous diffusion process triggered by
the beam-plasma instability and induced in space across the magnetic
field by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the velocity space
diffusion induced along the magnetic field due to the kinetic effects
of the beam-plasma instability. In the present slab geometry it is
found that the collisionless diffusion coefficients D<sub>y</sub> and
D<sub>v<sub><img
src=/graphics/symbols/parallel.gif></sub></sub>,
describing respectively the anomalous diffusion in physical space and
in velocity space, are related by the relation D<sub>y</sub> =
D<sub>v<sub><img
src=/graphics/symbols/parallel.gif></sub></sub>tan<sup>2</sup><img
src=/graphics/symbols/theta.gif>/<img
src=/graphics/symbols/omega.gif><sup>2</sup><sub>ce</sub>. This
relation, which links the electron dynamics in the x-y real space and
in the y-v<sub><img
src=/graphics/symbols/parallel.gif></sub> phase
space, is verified accurately using the test particles diagnostic
techniques. The Vlasov code associated with test particles techniques
provides a powerful tool to study particle diffusion in space and in
phase space, especially in the low-density regions of the distribution
function.


<h5>ELECTROLYTIC DEVICES</h5>

<a name="7"><b>How to Produce the Pons-Fleischmann Effect</b></a><br>
<i>Edmund Storms</i>
<p>

The conditions required for producing excess energy in PdD created in
an electrolytic cell are described and reasons for their importance
are discussed. Procedures are described that will increase the chance
for success in producing an effect whose concept has been difficult to
accept.


<h5>DIVERTOR SYSTEMS</h5>

<a name="8"><b>Sensitivity of Neutral Throughput to Geometry and
Plasma Position in the Tokamak Physics Experiment Divertor
Region</b></a><br>
<i>D. R. Juliano, D. N. Ruzic, D. Hill, K. A. Werley</i>
<p>

Sufficient neutral atom and molecular throughput is essential for the
steady-state operation of the proposed Tokamak Physics Experiment
tokamak. To predict the throughput, the B2 edge-plasma fluid code and
the DEGAS Monte Carlo neutral transport code were coupled
globally. For the day 1 low-power (17.5-MW) operation condition, the
recycling coefficient for both codes matched at 0.985, implying that
for every 1000 ions striking the divertor plate, 15 are ultimately
removed down the pump duct. The neutral molecular density was 2.52
<img src=/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif> 0.15 x
10<sup>19</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>, giving a throughput of 92.6 <img
src=/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif> 5.6 Torr<img
src="/graphics/symbols/dot.gif"
align=absmiddle><i>l</i>/s. Varying the scrape-off length for the
plasma extending into the gap between the baffle and the plate from 0
to 2 cm decreased the throughput by a factor of >2. Moving the strike
point away from the gap at first increases the throughput by lessening
the pumping efficiency of the plasma in the gap. As the plasma is
moved even farther away, the throughp!  ut drops due to a lack of
source term for neutrals entering the pumped region. Illustrating the
importance of moving the source term, moving the strike point away
from the gap but retaining the original plasma in the gap lowers the
throughput by a factor of 10. Altering the curvature of the baffle has
little effect on the neutral solution.


<h5>PLASMA ENGINEERING</h5>

<a name="9"><b>Low Loop Voltage Startup and Equilibrium Control Using
Multivariable Poloidal Field Coils in the Hitachi Tokamak
HT-2</b></a><br>
<i>Mitsushi Abe, Kazuhiro Takeuchi</i>
<p>

Tokamak operation techniques to control the poloidal magnetic field
using multivariable poloidal field coils (MPFCs) were applied to the
Hitachi tokamak HT-2. Two problems encountered in operating a tokamak
with MPFCs were identified: low-voltage startup and equilibrium
control without interference. The key to their solution was accurate
control of the poloidal magnetic field. To obtain multipole fields, a
singular value decomposition was applied to a response matrix from the
coil current to the magnetic flux value at the plasma surface
region. The multipole fields are orthogonal bases of the poloidal
field, and the interference was cleared using these modes. A control
technique using the multipole fields was applied to control the null
point position of the poloidal magnetic field during breakdown, which
made it possible to get breakdown with a low loop voltage. During the
flattop phase, good controllability without interference was obtained
using the concept of a multipole m!  agnetic field.


<h5>SAFETY/ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS</h5>

<a name="10"><b>Incorporating Safety and Environmental Aspects in
Fusion Reactor Systems Studies--The Prerequisites, Impacts, and
Applications</b></a><br>
<i>S. K. Ho, L. J. Perkins</i>
<p>

A first-of-its-kind comprehensive overview of schematic procedures for
incorporating safety and environmental (S1ampIE) aspects in fusion
reactor systems studies is presented. The potential future application
of this methodology will provide a tool to enhance the emphasis on
S1ampIE interactively in the early phase of reactor design
studies. This is illustrated by some representative couplings between
reactor design parameters and S1ampIE characteristics.


<center><h4>TECHNICAL NOTE</h4></center>

<h5>NUCLEAR DATA</h5>

<a name="11"><b>The Microstructure of Electrolytically
Deuterium-Loaded Palladium Rods</b></a><br>
<i>Swe-Kai Chen, Chi-Meen Wan, En-Hwei Liu, Shuh-Bair Chu, Chi-Yung
Liang, Liq-Ji Yuan, Chi-Chiao Wan</i>
<p>

Microstructural studies were conducted on palladium specimens that
were taken from ambient-temperature heavy water and
elevated-temperature molten-salt electrolytic experiments. Both
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the surface and interior
portions of these specimens. A subgrain structure could be observed by
SEM on the surface along the longitudinal direction and on the surface
taken from the cross section of the deuterium-charged specimen rod;
the thermoelectrochemical etching process was consequently applied to
the deuterium-charged specimen rod. A TEM bright field and selected
area diffraction pattern technique verified that dislocation cells and
subgrains exist in the deuterium-charged specimens. If cold fusion
effects exist in the palladium microstructure, which consists of
dislocation cells and subgrains, understanding the cold fusion
phenomenon in the microstructure is necessary, and pursuant to thi!  s
understanding, electrolytic experiments of a palladium rod in molten
salt and of heavy water may be useful.

<i><b>"DOE Employees in Pro-Nuclear Alliance Tread Narrow Legal Line"</b><br>
ELECTRIC POWER ALERT, 5/8/96, p. 17</i><br>
Staff Report
<p>

"The emergence of an aggressively pro-nuclear coalition of utilities,
trade associations and directors of five Dept. of Energy laboratories
is unleashing grave concern among scientists and environmentalists as
to the legality of government officials lobbying Congress," ELECTRIC
POWER ALERT reports.
<p>

Called the "Eagle Alliance," the coalition is pushing "a bold new
movement to revitalize nuclear science and technology in America."
The group had planned a meeting for May and already has a brochure
with a membership list and a set of objectives.  The participants list
"reads like a Who's Who of the nuclear community," including officials
from the Nuclear Energy Institute, the Tennessee Valley Authority,
Edison Electric Institute and national lab directors from Los Alamos,
Oak Ridge, Brookhaven, Argonne and DOE's Idaho Operations.
<p>

The alliance is backing a "broad range" of objectives to promote
nuclear technologies, including support for more nuclear power plants.
And the group is embracing a "panoply" of tactics such as securing
"pro- nuclear planks in major political parties for the 1996
elections" and making "persuasive contact via senior nuclear personnel
to every incumbent and candidate for 1996 congressional and
gubernatorial offices in the nation."
<p>

Sources with the group Public Citizen and the Nevada Nuclear Waste
Task Force believe the officials overstep legal boundaries by
participating in lobbying activities.  Georgetown University law
professor Paul Rothstein said it is illegal to use the name of the
agency if employees are "putting forth a personal view that has not
been put forth by the agency."
<p>

But a DOE spokesman said upon reviewing the Eagle Alliance brochure,
only one official on the list is actually a DOE employee.

<i><b>"War Over Waterford"</b><br>
NEW ORLEANS TIMES-PICAYUNE, 6/3/96, p. 6B</i><br>
Editorial
<p>

St. Charles Parish officials won the "first skirmish" in their fight
to "hang on to" property tax revenue from the Waterford 3 nuclear
power plant after a state Senate committee defeated a bill to divide
tax revenue from the plant among the parishes it serves.  But Bill
sponsor Sen. John Hainkel (R) of New Orleans said he has not given up;
and Jefferson Parish, which stood to gain $4.7 million from the law,
has hired a company to help it get the revenue.
<p>

Share-the-wealth proponents argue that Waterford 3 building costs and
St. Charles Parish taxes will be borne by all Entergy customers and so
have named it "taxation without representation."
<p>

The TIMES-PICAYUNE found more compelling the argument of St.  Charles
officials who countered that no other parishes were willing to accept
the risk of having a nuclear power plant within their
boundaries. St. Charles has had to contend with wastes from the plant
and demands on parish services, such as an 800- student surge in its
public schools.

... The US NRC has proposed a $100,000 fine against a unit of CT-based
Northeast Utilities over the layoff of a technician after he raised
safety concerns.  The technician, Adam McNiece, worked for a
contractor, Bartlett Nuclear of Plymouth, MA.  Citing his privacy, the
NRC declined to discuss the outcome of a probe into the safety issues
he raised (WALL STREET JOURNAL, 6/5/96, p. B8, Staff Report).

<p>
<img src="/graphics/gifs/stripe.gif">
<p>

... The US NRC cited a unit of Atlanta-based The Southern Co. for
unfair retaliation in the firing of two managers who raised safety
concerns at the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia.  Georgia Power
called the action "disappointing" and said it would continue several
legal challenges.  The NRC did not fine Georgia Power, saying the
five- year statute of limitations had expired (WALL STREET JOURNAL,
6/5/96, p. C2, Staff Report).

<p>

...  "Weighed down" by nuclear power investments, Illinois Power Co.'s
debt load comes to 85% of stock value, according to Moody's Investors
Service, which still put $1.8 billion in IP securities under review
for a possible ratings upgrade.  The Decatur-based utility, a unit of
Illinova Corp., has cut costs in recent months, but production costs
remain above average in the region (CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 5/31/96, p. 3,
Staff Report).

<p>

<a name=1><b>The Specific Research and Development Contribution of Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste Containing Long-Lived Elements</b><br></a>
<i>Jean-Claude Petit</i>
<p>

An overview is given of the research carried out by the French Atomic
Energy Commission on the geological disposal of nuclear
waste. Recalling the new legal framework of these studies, the
specific methodology of this field, which relies on the association of
laboratory and in situ experiments, natural analogues, and modeling is
emphasized. Next are underlined the basic questions, which have to be
reliably answered when one wants to predict the behavior of the
repository and the fate of the most radiotoxic nuclides, in particular
over very long time spans: What parameters govern the hydrodynamics
and the geochemistry of the system? What are the processes controlling
the degradation of the different technological and natural barriers,
as well as the release, migration, and retardation of radionuclides
through the geosphere? For each of these issues, the current programs
of research are described and indications are given about significant
achievements.


<p>

<a name=2><b>Legislative and Regulatory Aspects of Radioactive Waste Management in France</b><br></a>
<i>Jean-Christophe Niel</i>
<p>

The French legislative and regulatory framework for safe management of
radioactive waste is presented. Emphasis is put on legislative aspects
for the management of high-level waste and on the operation of surface
disposal for low-level waste. Other topics such as policy and issues
for very low-level waste or dismantling are also briefly developed.


<p>

<a name=3><b>The Role of Characterization as an Interface Between Safety Authorities, Waste Producers, Radwaste Managers, and Research Laboratories</b><br></a>
<i>Denis Alexandre</i>
<p>

Characterization is the sum of measurements and tests applied to a
waste package to prove that all its characteristics meet the
acceptance requirements drawn up by the authorities in charge of final
disposal. If waste producers are in charge of acceptance file
presentation, specialized laboratories are involved in testing
operations and data interpretation. Because of their knowledge of
wastes and the conditioning matrices they have developed, the people
in charge of characterization are placed at an interface between
producers, repository managers, safety authorities, and research
laboratories. Some examples drawn from different fields of activity
are given here to illustrate this remarkable situation.


<p>

<a name=4><b>Characterization of Low- and Medium-Activity Radioactive Waste</b><br></a>
<i>Alain P. M. Heres, Maxy C. Noe</i>
<p>

In France, specifications for long-lived isotopes, which are critical
for the safety of intermediate storage and disposal on surface sites,
have been fixed.
<p>

Because a number of these nuclides are pure beta or alpha emitters, a
reliable radiochemical inventory of these isotopes requires a rather
sophisticated preparative chemistry before radiation measurement. In
view of the initial complexity of matrices for various types of waste,
the preparation steps constitute a technological limit to the
characterization. Therefore, practices eventually developed for
synthetic waste may prove insufficient when applied to real samples.
<p>

For isotopes with half-lives >10<sup>5</sup> yr, such as <sup>99</sup>Tc
and <sup>129</sup>I, a physicochemical technique, inductively coupled
plasma/mass spectrometry, constitutes an attractive alternative to
radiochemical procedures. However, the request for high performance
and limitations in sample activity does not allow preparative
treatments and chemical separations from interfering species to be
minimized.


<p>

<a name=5><b>Neutron Moisture Meter Measurement in Waste Packages</b><br></a>
<i>Josee Perfettini</i>
<p>

A neutronic method based on neutron thermalization by hydrogen nuclei
is used to measure the moisture content in packages of radioactive
waste embedded in hydraulic binders. The two steps of the measurement
are (a) acquisition of the neutron characteristics of the embedded
waste considered (or of a chemically similar material) and (b) the
measurement itself obtained with a neutron moisture meter.
<p>

The neutron characteristics required are the adsorption and diffusion
cross sections <img src="/graphics/symbols/Sigma.gif"><sub>a</sub> and
<img src="/graphics/symbols/Sigma.gif"><sub>d</sub> for thermal
neutrons of the dried material. These two parameters are used to
calculate the calibration curve (valid only for the material
considered) as follows: <p>

N = (<img src="/graphics/symbols/alpha.gif"><img src="/graphics/symbols/dot.gif">Ds + <img
src="/graphics/symbols/beta.gif" align=middle>)Hv + <img
src="/graphics/symbols/gamma.gif"><img src="/graphics/symbols/dot.gif">Ds + <img
src="/graphics/symbols/delta.gif"> , <p>

which allows the counting N of the neutron moisture meter to be
converted into free-water content Hv (<img src="/graphics/symbols/alpha.gif">, <img src="/graphics/symbols/beta.gif">, <img src="/graphics/symbols/gamma.gif">, and
<img src="/graphics/symbols/delta.gif"> are deduced from <img src="/graphics/symbols/Sigma.gif"><sub>a</sub> and <img src="/graphics/symbols/Sigma.gif"><sub>d</sub>; Ds is the dry density
of the material).
<p>

The neutron moisture meter (containing a fast neutron source and a
thermalized neutron detector) is portable. Measurements are taken at
various depths in a core hole made in the package to draw a water
profile.
<p>

The measurements are taken in materials used for waste solidification
and in active or inactive packages. The results obtained (free-water
content) are in good agreement with those obtained by determining the
weight loss at 120 degrees C (the differences between these two
measurements are generally ~10% when the free-water content is ~20 to
25%). The water profiles allow one to detect the presence of excessive
free water.


<p>

<a name=6><b>Nondestructive Determination of Activity</b><br></a>
<i>Bernard Chabalier</i>
<p>

Characterization and appraisal tests include the measurement of
activity in raw waste and waste packages. After conditioning,
variations in density, matrix composition, and geometry make
evaluation of the radionuclide activity in a package destined for
storage nearly impossible without measurements and with a low
uncertainty.
<p>

Various nondestructive measuring techniques that use ionizing
radiation are employed to characterize waste packages and raw
waste. Gamma spectrometry is the most widely used technique because of
its simple operation and low cost. This technique is used to quantify
the beta-gamma and alpha activity of gamma-emitting radionuclides as
well as to check the radioactive homogeneity of the waste packages.
<p>

Numerous systems for directly measuring waste packages have been
developed. Two types of methods may be distinguished, depending on
whether results that come from the measurements are weighted by an
experimentally determined corrective term or by calculation.
<p>

Through the MARCO and CARACO measuring systems, a method is described
that allows one to quantify the activity of the beta-gamma and alpha
radionuclides contained in either a waste package or raw waste whose
geometries and material compositions are more or less accurately
known.
<p>

This method is based on (a) measurement by gamma spectrometry of the
beta-gamma and alpha activity of the gamma-emitting radionuclides
contained in the waste package and (b) the application of calculated
corrections; thus, the limitations imposed by reference package
geometry and matrix are avoided.


<p>

<a name=7><b>Destructive Procedures and Analytical Tools for the Study of Radwaste Packages</b><br></a>
<i>Dominique Grec</i>
<p>

The destructive inspection of low- and medium-active waste (raw or
conditioned) requires the development of analytical procedures and of
a suitable technology. In this field, specific difficulties result
from the radiological hazards inherent to the test progress
(irradiation, contamination) and also from the concern to protect the
samples from various sources as well as the need to preserve their
representativity. The destructive procedures and the analytical tools
developed in our laboratory to perform these studies are presented.


<p>

<a name=8><b>Determination of Physical Homogeneity by Gamma-Ray Imaging</b><br></a>
<i>Jean-Luc Pettier</i>
<p>

Nondestructive examination methods are particularly useful in
characterizing radioactive waste. Radiographic examinations combined
with tomodensitometric examinations (scanner) using a gamma-ray photon
source make it possible to conduct exhaustive testing of the physical
homogeneity of a low- or medium-activity waste package. These methods
provide original experimental data for the following purposes: (a)
preliminary characterization of packages for approval of the treatment
process, (b) quality control of the produced packages (production
control at the producer's site and counterchecks by the waste control
organism), (c) examination of packages, and (d) activity computation
codes based on the emergent activity. The selection criteria, the
physical principles, and the originality of the tool and some of its
applications are described.


<p>

<a name=9><b>Studies on Important Radionuclides for the Safety of a Radioactive Waste Disposal Site: Correlation Between Easily Measurable Gamma Emitters and Long-Lived Radionuclides</b><br></a>
<i>Alain Raymond, Brigitte Lagarde, Annick Pitiot</i>
<p>

To comply with the regulations laid down by the French safety
authorities for a national surface disposal site, one must obtain a
good evaluation of the activity of the long-lived nuclides in each
individual package. Because this cannot be done on a routine basis by
direct nondestructive measurements, experiments are being conducted in
France to calculate the activity of long-lived nuclides from the
measured activity of ``key'' nuclides (<sup>60</sup>Co and
<sup>137</sup>Cs). This is achieved through the use of scaling factors
and correlation functions that are calculated from the analysis of a
limited number of representative waste samples.
<p>

The first results obtained for some typical French pressurized water
reactor radioactive wastes, including ion-exchange resins, evaporator
concentrates, and filter cartridges, are presented. Significant
correlations are observed for the <sup>63</sup>Ni/<sup>60</sup>Co and
<sup>94</sup>Nb/<sup>60</sup>Co nuclide pairs, while <sup>14</sup>C does
not seem to correlate with <sup>60</sup>Co. A good correlation between
<sup>137</sup>Cs and <sup>90</sup>Sr is established for resins, while in
the case of filters, only a tendency to correlation appears.
<p>

This evaluation work is only at a preliminary stage, and much
improvement of the results presented here is expected from research
programs being carried out in this field by Electricite de France,
Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, and the French National Agency for
Radioactive Waste Management in cooperation with the Commission of the
European Communities.


<p>

<a name=10><b>Review of the Development of Waste Form Conditioning Processes in France</b><br></a>
<i>C. Courtois, J. P. Moncouyoux, E. Revertegat</i>
<p>

For many years conditioning processes have been studied and developed
in France with the general objective of putting wastes into solid and
stable waste forms having good leaching properties and long-term
stability. The knowledge of radioactive characteristics of waste
enables one to define what will be its final destination (near-surface
or geological disposal) and the nature of the required conditioning
and package with respect to French regulatory requirements. After
waste materials have been treated prior to conditioning, they have to
be encapsulated for transport storage and disposal. The main matrices
(such as bitumen, glass, cement, polymers) and processes that have
been developed in France are indicated. The state of art for each
matrix is briefly reviewed taking into account long-term behavior
studies. Main advantages and drawbacks are indicated. Recent
developments are also briefly reviewed for previous matrices and also
for new mineral matrices such as ceramics and molten metal. General
consideration is given to the conditioning processes that have been
studied and developed up to the industrial level in France.


<p>

<a name=11><b>Studies on the Degassing of Waste Packages</b><br></a>
<i>Dominique Grec</i>
<p>

In medium-level waste (MLW) and high-level waste (HLW), the wasteform
undergoes self-irradiation due to enclosed radionuclides. This
interaction results in the generation of gaseous products and at the
same time the possible release of volatile radionuclides by the waste
itself. Their accumulation could be a source of safety problems in the
production stage and also during interim storage or final disposal. It
is necessary to study these phenomena. The principle for monitoring,
sampling, and instrumentation equipment for containers (Appareillage
de Surveillance, de Prelevement et d'Instrumentation pour Conteneurs),
intended for study and the follow-up of gaseous products released by a
waste package, is presented.


<p>

<a name=12><b>Overview of the French Program on Leaching Various Waste Forms</b><br></a>
<i>J. C. Nomine, J. F. Ferriot</i>
<p>

Performing leach tests provides quality assurance and verification
that radioactive waste packages are acceptable for final shallow land
burial, in accordance with environmental policy. An overview
assessment was completed on the leaching tests and on the leachability
of various waste forms, regarding both the industrial and the research
and development aspects of the leachability and illustrated by several
examples. The most important aspects extracted from this overview are
as follows:

<ol>
  <li> Leaching tests must be performed on all types of package
       candidates for an ultimate near-surface disposal whatever the
       waste form: The corresponding results are necessary for the
       safety assessment demonstration of the disposal site.
  <li> Representativeness of leached specimens remains to be fully
       proved, especially when they are small samples (problems of
       size and also of leached surface).
  <li> Quality of the waste packages whose type has been accepted
       should be periodically audited to establish deviations from the
       quality agreed on.
  <li> An exhaustive material balance of the released activity in
       leachates and fixed on surfaces must be established when
       performing leaching tests, especially for alpha emitters that
       can become attached to surfaces in the leaching loops.
  <li> Influence of temperature and pressure on the leaching results
       have been identified as important factors for cesium leaching
       of cemented waste.
  <li> More generally, there has been good progress in leaching
       knowledge, but the influence of many parameters, such as
       durability effect on leaching, remains incompletely defined.
</ol>

<p>

<a name=13><b>Waste Forms--French Leaching Test Compared with Lysimeter Tests</b><br></a>
<i>J. F. Ferriot, J. C. Nomine, V. Reynaud</i>
<p>

Leaching tests are a means to determine if a radioactive waste package
is acceptable for final disposal in accordance with the requirements
of the regulation authorities. The relation between the leaching
behavior of solidified waste with hydraulic binders or polymer
matrices in the following different testing conditions has been
examined:

<ol>
  <li> French standard leaching tests (immersion in a specific volume
       of shallow land-disposal groundwater)
  <li> lysimeter experiments in various hydraulic environments with
       lower water contents.
</ol>

The latter conditions are more representative of repository conditions
for waste forms in shallow land disposal than the standard test and
therefore allow a better understanding of the phenomena to be
analyzed.
<p>

Real lysimeter experiments are complex, and their relations with a
standard test are even more so; therefore, after a brief survey of the
generally published works confirming this complexity, the choice of an
approach starting from a step-by-step simulation is defined, and the
experiments are presented in order of development.
<p>

The results generated for cemented wastes, while incomplete, provide
the following conclusions:

<ol>
  <li> Activity fractions released are little different (maximum difference is 25%) between the two following types of tests:

       <ol type=a>
	 <li> the type of test where waste forms are placed in contact
	      with an inert simulated backfill material with different
	      moisture contents (from a 35% volumetric water content
	      in saturated state to ~2 134672392n
	      unsaturated equilibrium) and with sequential renewal of
	      the leachant (by fast saturation for 15 min and draining
	      for 30 min at the beginning of each sequence)
	 <li> the reference case derived from the French standard
	      leaching test (by means of sequentially renewed periods
	      of soaking only in a typical volume and representative
	      composition of groundwater).
       </ol>
  <li> rough preliminary trial of waste forms in a silica sand
       backfill led to the same conclusion as the results of waste
       forms release in a backfill material simulated by glass beads.
  <li> Moreover, with a high steady flow rate of water directly around
       the waste form sample and then 10 to 100 times the standard
       test water volume, the differences in leaching prove to be
       relatively slight and principally affected by the carbonate
       contents in the leachant synthetic qgroundwater, i.e., the
       carbonate content coming up from the CO<sub>2</sub> of the
       environment during the test. The carbonation of the cemented
       waste can reduce the leaching so much that, in spite of the
       considerable water volume involved (10 to 100 times the
       standard amounts), the cesium leached fractions prove to be
       lower than the standard fractions.
  <li> Typical experiments with nearly dry waste environments are also
       in progress; they have already shown the following:

       <ol type=a>
	 <li> Very small leached fractions of cesium migrate in this
	      inert porous backfill with a low moisture content; in
	      particular, on the glass beads 1 cm away (and beyond)
	      from the embedded waste, the cesium fractions found are
	      only <0.01 the leached fractions found in the water of
	      the standard test.
	 <li> However, at the same time, almost as much cesium as
	      during the standard leaching test becomes available (at
	      the surface of the cemented waste), being able to be
	      quickly leached by simple rinsing or soaking, as if it
	      is accumulated in quickly accessible parts of the
	      cemented waste.
       </ol>
</ol>

Our current explanation of the very low cesium fraction in the nearly
dry part of the backfill is that the diffusion area is very much
reduced in this unsaturated material because the water distribution
becomes very discontinuous in the large pores of such a backfill.

<p>
<a name=0><b>System Modeling and Reactor Design Studies of the Advanced Thermionic Initiative Space Nuclear Reactor</b><br></a>
<i>Hsing H. Lee, Shahab Abdul-Hamid, Andrew C. Klein</i>
<p>

In-core thermionic space reactor design concepts that operate at a
nominal power output range of 20 to 50 kW(electric) are
described. Details of the neutronic, thermionic, thermal hydraulics,
and shielding performance are presented. Because of the strong
absorption of thermal neutrons by natural tungsten and the large
amount of natural tungsten within the reactor core, two designs are
considered.
<p>

An overall system design code has been developed at Oregon State
University to model advanced in-core thermionic energy
conversion-based nuclear reactor systems for space applications. The
code modules include neutronics and core criticality, a thermionic
fuel element (TFE) performance module with integral thermal-hydraulic
calculation capability, a radiation-shielding module, and a module for
the waste heat rejection.
<p>

The results show that the driverless single-cell Advanced Thermionic
Initiative (ATI) configuration, which does not have driver fuel rods,
proved to be more efficient than the driven core, which has driver
rods. The results also show that the inclusion of the true axial and
radial power distribution decrease the overall conversion
efficiency. The flattening of the radial power distribution by three
different methods would lead to a higher efficiency. The results show
that only one TFE works at the optimum emitter temperature; all other
TFEs are off the optimum performance and result in a 40 0ecrease of
the efficiency of the overall system.
<p>

The true axial profile is significantly different as there is a
considerable amount of neutron leakage out of the top and bottom of
the reactor. The analysis reveals that the axial power profile
actually has a chopped cosine shape. For this axial profile, the
reactor core overall efficiency for the driverless ATI reactor version
is found to be 5.84% with a total electrical power of 21.92
kW(electric). By considering the true axial power profile instead of
the uniform power profile, each TFE loses ~80 W(electric).

<a name=1><b>Anticipated Transient Without Scram Analysis of the Simplified Boiling Water Reactor Following Main Steam Isolation Valve Closure with Boron Injection</b><br></a>
<i>Hasna J. Khan, Hsiang-Shou Cheng, Upendra S. Rohatgi</i>
<p>

The simplified boiling water reactor (SBWR) operating in natural
circulation is designed with many passive safety features. An
anticipated transient without scram (ATWS) initiated by inadvertent
closure of the main steam isolation valve (MSIV) in an SBWR has been
analyzed using the RAMONA-4B code of Brookhaven National
Laboratory. This analysis demonstrates the predicted performance of
the SBWR during an MSIV closure ATWS, followed by shutdown of the
reactor through injection of boron into the reactor core from the
standby liquid control system.

<a name=2><b>Analytical Study of Subcritical Vapor Explosions Using Thermal Detonation Wave Theory</b><br></a>
<i>Bassam I. Shamoun, Michael L. Corradini</i>
<p>

Experimental observation has shown that the assumption of complete
fuel fragmentation in a vapor explosion by the shock adiabatic
thermodynamic model results in predicting upper bounds for the shock
pressure, propagation velocity, and work output. This model has been
modified by considering the condition where the assumption of complete
fragmentation of the fuel is relaxed. A methodology is adopted using
experimental values of the shock pressure and propagation velocity to
estimate the initial mixture conditions of the experiment and the mass
fraction of the materials participating in the explosion. Analysis of
a steady-state subcritical vapor explosion in one dimension has been
carried out by applying the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and
energy and the appropriate equation of state for a homogeneous mixture
of molten tin and water. The KROTOS-21 experiment, conducted at the
Joint Research Center at Ispra, Italy, was used as the initial
benchmark experiment in this analysis. A quasi-steady explosion
pressure of ~3 MPa and a propagation velocity of ~200 m/s were
obtained in this experiment. Using this model, the estimated minimum
mass of the fragmented fuel was found to be 0.21 kg (3.2%) of the
total mass of the fuel. The predicted work output by this model
corresponding to the aforementioned fragmented fuel mass was found to
be 9.8 kJ. The estimated initial void fraction of the vapor was found
to be 11.5%. In these analyses, a comparison is made of the various
possible closure relations applied to the detonation wave theory for a
vapor explosion and associated concerns of model stability in the
two-phase region.

<p>
<a name=3><b>Liquid-Metal/Water Interactions in a Shock Tube</b><br></a>
<i>Gordana Vukovic, Michael L. Corradini</i>
<p>

To investigate liquid-metal (fuel)/water (coolant) interactions, a
vertical shock tube has been designed and constructed. A series of
tests was conducted with gallium, indium, lead, and tin as the fuel
materials at either ``low'' (<i>T<sub>f</sub></i> ~ 300 degrees C) or
``high'' fuel temperature (<i>T<sub>f</sub></i> ~ 600 degrees C), with
water at room temperature (low <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>) and in the range
of <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> = 56 to 67 degrees C (high T<sub>c</sub>), and
with driving pressures from 0.25 to 1.22 MPa. These materials were
tested to determine their compatibility for potential use in
liquid-metal divertor systems for fusion power plants.  <p>

The increase in fuel and water temperature, as well as the increase of
driving pressure, caused more energetic interactions to occur. High
<i>T<sub>f</sub></i> tin and lead interactions, and high
<i>T<sub>f</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> gallium and indium
interactions were the most energetic. Stronger interactions produced
finer debris fragments. In high <i>T<sub>f</sub></i> gallium and
indium interactions, small superficial oxidation was observed. For the
first two pulses, larger ratios of compression- (compression of
expansion vessel gas) to-expansion work correspond to the experiments
with higher fuel and coolant temperatures. For the first pulse, only
work ratio values of the most energetic experiments are larger than
those of isothermal experiments. Consequently, for such experiments,
the impulse values of second pulses are the largest. Higher values of
the conversion ratio for the first pulse correspond to more energetic
interactions. Even for the most energetic experiments, the conversion
ratio is no higher than 1.2%, and no more than 15% (or a few
millimetres-thick surface layer) of the initially loaded fuel
participated in the interaction, assuming equal initial volumes of
fuel and coolant.


<h5>NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLES</h5>

<p>
<a name=4><b>Average Irradiation Temperature for the Analysis of In-Pile Integral Measurements</b><br></a>
<i>Abdellatif M. Yacout, Won-Sik Yang, Gerard L. Hofman, Yuri Orechwa</i>
<p>

Integral parameters of reactor fuel pins are usually measured after
long periods of irradiation, where each period can extend over a
number of irradiation cycles. Examples of these parameters include
cladding diametral strain and parameters involved in the evaluation of
fuel/cladding chemical interaction and fuel restructuring. Analysis of
these parameters requires knowledge of calculated irradiation
parameters, which can vary between irradiation cycles and within the
cycles. Irradiation temperature is one such parameter. A calculated
weighted average temperature that takes into account the fluctuations
in temperature between irradiation cycles is introduced. The work
discusses the justification for using this temperature and a
methodology for its validation. The methodology is based on comparing
calculated average temperatures with temperatures inferred from the
postirradiation examination of restructured binary metallic fuel pins
in the Experimental Breeder Reactor II. The analysis shows reasonable
agreeme nt between the two temperatures. The peak irradiation
temperatures, which are usually used in the analysis, were out of the
range of the temperatures inferred from the experimental observations,
showing the importance of using the average temperature.


<h5>RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT</h5>

<p>
<a name=5><b>Thermodynamic Properties of Water in Compacted Sodium Montmorillonite</b><br></a>
<i>Yuji Torikai, Seichi Sato, Hiroshi Ohashi</i>
<p>

Compacted bentonite is a promising material as an engineering barrier
to enclose nuclear waste. The migration of nuclides occurs in the
water of bentonite, where the major mineral is sodium
montmorillonite. To determine the thermodynamic properties of water in
compacted sodium montmorillonite, the equilibrium vapor pressure of
the water in the montmorillonite was measured as a function of water
content and temperature, without external pressure.
<p>

The thermodynamic properties depend on water content but not on the
dry density of unsaturated specimens. In montmorillonite, single-layer
adsorption may proceed from 0 to 16 wt% water content, two-layer
adsorption from 16 to 27 wt%, and three-layer adsorption above 27 wt%;
pore water appears only in the last region. It is probable that 30 wt%
of the total water included in saturated montmorillonite is not in the
interlayer between platelets at 45.0 wt% water content and 0.80 x
10<sup>3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> dry density. There is a very slight
amount of water, which is not bound between platelets at dry densities
of 1.20 and 1.76 x 10<sup>3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>. This water is not a
dilute electrolytic solution but has higher ionic strength, like
typical seawater of salinity 23/ and saturated NaCl.


<h5>MATERIALS</h5>

<p>
<a name=6><b>Thermodynamic Study in Support of Pressurized Water Reactor Specific Reactor Water Chemistry</b><br></a>
<i>Kostadin A. Dinov, Kazuo Kasahara</i>
<p>

A theoretical approach is discussed that regards the kinetically
determined pressurized water reactor (PWR) primary system as a set of
thermodynamically defined metastable states that the related
high-temperature aqueous system containing a combination of possible
oxide phases (Ni<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,
Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and metallic nickel or NiO) and
corresponding dissolution products may undergo under specified initial
conditions.
<p>

The study shows that stability zones of those metastable states,
particularly M<sub>1</sub>
(Ni<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and M<sub>3</sub> (Ni(m)
+ Ni<sub>x</sub>Fe<sub>3-x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), cover practically the
entire PWR operational range and depend on specific plant conditions
and applied chemistry control. The thermodynamic analysis is
predicated on the belief that defining the stability transition
boundary between those states--found as a function of temperature,
coolant pH, dissolved hydrogen (DH), and ferrite stoichiometry (x
value)--is of primary importance for corrosion product behavior. Such
a stability change influences both the particulate and ionic levels
and the related activity transport and should be regarded as an
important factor in optimizing PWR primary chemistry.  <p>

The study offers an original approach to reassessing such important
issues as thermodynamic data and the solubility of spinel oxides, the
role of transport of particulates and soluble species, ``optimum'' pH
and DH, and the chemistry effect on crud burst.


<h5>HEAT TRANSFER AND FLUID FLOW</h5>

<p>
<a name=7><b>The Influence of Complex Pore Shapes on Thermal Conductivity</b><br></a>
<i>Klaas Bakker, Rudy J. M. Konings</i>
<p>

The thermal conductivity of UO<sub>2</sub> is an important parameter
in the design of nuclear fuel assemblies. The thermal conductivity can
be reduced by radiation-induced porosity, leading to increased safety
risks. In the literature, an analytical equation has been suggested to
describe the influence of randomly ordered ellipsoidal porosity on
thermal conductivity. However, in the case where the shape and the
distribution of the pores is very complex, as in irradiated nuclear
fuel, this equation is less well suited.
<p>

The finite element method is introduced as a computational technique
to take into account the influence of complex porosity structures on
the thermal conductivity. Using the combination of image analysis and
the finite element method, an equation has been obtained that
describes the relation between the average elongated form of the pores
and the overall thermal conductivity. Both the finite element method
and image analysis are tools to estimate the thermal conductivity of
high-burnup nuclear fuel.


<h5>RADIATION PROTECTION</h5>

<a name=8><b>Development and Application of Neutron Field Optimization Parameters for an Accelerator-Based Neutron Source for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</b><br></a>
<i>Jeffrey E. Woollard, Thomas E. Blue, Nilendu Gupta, Reinhard A. Gahbauer</i>
<p>

Design parameters for an epithermal neutron field for an
accelerator-based source of neutrons for boron neutron capture therapy
are developed. The parameters that are developed incorporate predicted
biological effects in patients' heads. They are based on an
energy-spectrum-dependent neutron normal-tissue relative biological
effectiveness and the treatment planning methodology of Gahbauer and
his coworkers, which includes the effects of dose fractionation. The
neutron field optimization parameters are evaluated for two epithermal
neutron fields resulting from an accelerator-based neutron source with
two different moderator assemblies. For the two moderator assemblies
and moderator thicknesses evaluated, the
D<sub>2</sub>O-Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> moderator assembly is
superior to the BeO-MgO moderator assembly. The absorbed-dose
delivered to the tumor for the
D<sub>2</sub>O-Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> moderator assembly is
larger than that for the BeO-MgO moderator assembly for almost all
tumor depths.  The treatment times for the
D<sub>2</sub>O-Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> moderator assembly are
slightly longer than for the BeO-MgO moderator assembly. However, for
a 10-mA proton current, the treatment times for both are reasonable.

<h5>ENRICHMENT AND REPROCESSING SYSTEMS</h5>

<p>
<a name=9><b>Development of Pyrometallurgical Partitioning of Actinides from High-Level Radioactive Waste Using a Reductive Extraction Step</b><br></a>
<i>Takatoshi Hijikata, Masahiro Sakata, Hajime Miyashiro, Kensuke Kinoshita, Tatsuhiro Higashi, Tadaharu Tamai</i>
<p>

High-level radioactive waste (HLW) from reprocessing (Purex) light
water reactor spent fuel contains a small number of long-lived
nuclides, mainly actinide elements, having half-lives of longer than
one million years. If actinide elements could be separated from HLW
and transmuted to short-lived nuclides, not only would waste
management be much simpler but also public support for nuclear power
generation might be easier to obtain. Central Research Institute of
Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI), Japan, has proposed a
pyrometallurgical process to separate actinides from HLW. When the
solvent used in the Purex process is reclaimed by NaCO<sub>3</sub> and
NaOH, a waste stream containing sodium with fission products and
actinides is produced also. The focus of CRIEPI is the disposal of HLW
from both the Purex and the solvent rinse processes. In this concept,
HLW is converted to chlorides, the actinides as molten chlorides are
reduced by lithium metal and extracted into liquid cadmium, and
finally, the actinides ar e purified by electrorefining. However, in
the extraction of actinides into liquid cadmium, some of the rare
earth elements are expected to be recovered together with the
actinides because of their chemical similarity. Thus, it is necessary
to obtain thermodynamic data of the actinides and rare earth elements
in molten chlorides and liquid cadmium. The distribution coefficients
for uranium, neptunium, and rare earth elements are determined in
molten LiCl-KCl eutectic salt/liquid cadmium (LiCl-KCl system) and
molten LiCl-NaCl salt/liquid cadmium (LiCl-NaCl system) systems. The
equilibrium distribution of uranium, neptunium, and rare earth
elements is also calculated based on the Gibbs energies of formation
of the metal chlorides and their activity coefficients in molten salts
and cadmium.

<h5>FISSION REACTORS</h5>


<p>
<a name=0><b>Pellet Power Ratio in a Pellet-Suspension Fission Core</b><br></a>
<i>D. R. Kingdon, A. A. Harms</i>
<p>

The average fuel pellet power ratio in a pellet-suspension core is
investigated. This ratio relates the electric power required to
sustain the pellet suspension to the electric power derivable from the
fission process. For 2 0.000000e+00nriched uranium in a suspending medium of
helium gas, a power ratio <img src="/graphics/symbols/geq.gif">2 x 10<sup>4</sup>
for a range of particle sizes is found. Comparable ratios of 1 x
10<sup>4</sup> for light water and 2 x 10<sup>3</sup> for liquid lead as
suspending mediums are determined. For each fluid, the power ratio
appears sufficiently favorable to warrant further investigation of
such fission reactor cores.

<a name=1><b>Study on Reactivity Worth of Beryllium by (n,2n) and (<img src="/graphics/symbols/gamma.gif">,n) Reactions</b><br></a>
<i>Tsuyoshi Misawa, Seiji Shiroya, Keiji Kanda</i>
<p>

Experiments on the reactivity worth of beryllium metal were performed
using the Kyoto University Critical Assembly, and they were analyzed
to examine the validity of the computational method to treat (n,2n)
reactions in calculations. The experimental results demonstrated that
beryllium metal has positive reactivity worth compared with
graphite. In the analysis, (n,2n) reactions were treated as modifying
scattering cross sections in a transport calculation, whereas both
scattering and absorption cross sections should be modified in a
diffusion calculation. The results of calculations for the reactivity
worth of beryllium agreed with experimental data within a few percent
in the calculated-to-experimental ratio. Calculated results indicated
that (n,2n) reactions of beryllium contribute by ~85% to the positive reactivity worth compared with graphite in
these experiments at a thermal reactor. Moreover, through the improved
neutron and gamma-ray coupled calculation, the effect of
(<img src="/graphics/symbols/gamma.gif">,n) reactions of beryllium on reactivity was estimated. It was
found that (<img src="/graphics/symbols/gamma.gif">,n) reactions of beryllium can be negligible so far
as this reactivity worth is concerned.

<p>
<a name=2><b>Assessment of the Simulation Capability of RELAP5/MOD3 Compared with IIST Tests for Loss of the Residual Heat Removal System During Midloop Operation</b><br></a>
<i>Yuh-Ming Ferng, Chien-Hsiung Lee</i>
<p>

The simulation capabilities of RELAP5/MOD3 are analyzed and assessed
in comparison with the IIST experiments conducted to investigate the
system response to the loss of the residual heat removal (RHR) system
during midloop operation. Two IIST experiments are simulated; a
one-loop test under closed system conditions and a three-loop test
with a vent at the top of the pressurizer. Once the RHR cooling system
is lost and if alternate heat sinks are not established in time, the
primary system will be heated up by the decay power, causing core
boiling, system pressurization, and potential core uncovery and fuel
heatup.
<p>

The predicted responses of system parameters by the current model show
reasonable agreement with the experimental data. These key parameters
consist of the system pressure transient, temperature histories, and
variation in the active heat transfer length within the steam
generator. The liquid flooding in the pressurizer and the steam
generator can also be captured in the current simulation.
<p>

A periodic fill-and-down cycle developed in the steam generator
U-tubes has been observed in the IIST measured data of oscillatory
differential pressure across the steam generator. This phenomenon is
not simulated in the calculation. However, the calculated differential
pressure will follow the experimental trend and agree qualitatively
with the measured data averaged over one fill-and-down cycle. As shown
in the comparison of the calculated and experimental data, the overall
system responses to the loss-of-RHR system event during midloop
operation can be appropriately simulated by the current RELAP5/MOD3
model.


<p>
<a name=3><b>A Model for Nonvolatile Fission Product Release During Reactor Accident Conditions</b><br></a>
<i>Brent J. Lewis, Bernard Andre, Gerard Ducros, Denis Maro</i>
<p>

An analytical model has been developed to describe the release
kinetics of nonvolatile fission products (e.g., molybdenum, cerium,
ruthenium, and barium) from uranium dioxide fuel under severe reactor
accident conditions. This treatment considers the rate-controlling
process of release in accordance with diffusional transport in the
fuel matrix and fission product vaporization from the fuel surface
into the surrounding gas atmosphere. The effect of the oxygen
potential in the gas atmosphere on the chemical form and volatility of
the fission product is considered. A correlation is also developed to
account for the trapping effects of antimony and tellurium in the
Zircaloy cladding.
<p>

This model interprets the release behavior of fission products
observed in Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique experiments conducted in
the HEVA/VERCORS facility at high temperature in a hydrogen and steam
atmosphere.


<p>
<a name=4><b>Passive Cooling System with Temperature Control for Reactor Containments</b><br></a>
<i>Charles W. Forsberg, James C. Conklin</i>
<p>

The temperature-initiated passive cooling system (TIPACS) is a new
reactor containment cooling system that is applicable to multiple
reactor types. TIPACS, which transfers heat from a hot, insulated
system to a cooler, external environment, has five defining
characteristics: It has efficient heat transfer, is passive (i.e., no
moving mechanical components), has a thermal switch mechanism that
allows heat transfer only above a preset temperature, has one-way
(heat diode) heat transfer from the internal warm system to ambient,
and is suitable to use with any size power reactor.
<p>

TIPACS consists of two subsystems: a heat transfer system (HTS) and a
temperature control system (TCS). The HTS in full operation is a
single-phase, natural-circulation system that uses carbon dioxide
(CO<sub>2</sub>) above its vapor-liquid critical point (T > 31
<sup>o</sup>C; P > 72.85 atm) as the heat transfer fluid. The TCS is a
passive device that blocks the flow of CO<sub>2</sub> if the interior
containment temperature drops below a preset temperature, which is
between the vapor-liquid critical point and ~15 <sup>o</sup>C below the
vapor-liquid critical temperature of CO<sub>2</sub>. The preset
temperature is determined by the system hardware design. The control
mechanism is driven only by the change of fluid properties near the
critical point (i.e., there are no active mechanical components).


<p>
<a name=5><b>RELAP5/MOD3 Simulation of the Station Blackout Experiment Conducted at the IIST Facility</b><br></a>
<i>Yuh-Ming Ferng, Tay-Jian Liu, Chien-Hsiung Lee</i>
<p>

Thermal-hydraulic responses in the station blackout experiment
conducted at the IIST facility are simulated through the use of the
advanced system code RELAP5/MOD3. Typical behaviors occurring in the
IIST station blackout transient are characterized by secondary
boiloff, primary saturation and pressurization, and subsequent core
uncovery and heatup. As the coolant inventory within the steam
generator secondary system boils dry, the primary system pressure
increases as a result of degradation of the heat removal ability of
the steam generator secondary side. This pressurization phenomenon
causes the pressurizer safety valve to open and the primary coolant to
deplete through the valve, causing the core to eventually become
uncovered. The same response can be exactly simulated by the current
model. The current calculated results show fairly good agreement with
the experimental data, but the timing of the events occurring in the
station blackout transient is calculated earlier than the measured
value. The overall comparison of key parameters between the calculated
results and IIST test data, however, reveals that the current
RELAP5/MOD3 model can provide reasonable station blackout modeling for
simulating long-term system behavior.


<h5>NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLES</h5>


<p>
<a name=6><b>Boron-Nitride-Coated Nuclear Fuels</b><br></a>
<i>Gungor Gunduz, I. brahim Uslu, Hasan H. Durmazuar</i>
<p>

Pure urania- and urania-gadolinia-containing fuel pellets were coated
with boron nitride (BN) to improve the physical and neutronic
properties of the fuel. The BN coating seems to have a technological
advantage over zirconium-diboride coating. The BN is chemically inert,
corrosion resistant, withstands rapid temperature changes, and has a
high thermal conductivity. Since gadolinia fuel has low thermal
conductivity, the gadolinia content can be lowered in the fuel by
coating it with BN. In fact, the existence of two burnable absorbers
in a fuel introduces desired nuclear properties since gadolinia is a
fast-burning and boron a slow-burning element. The BN was deposited on
fuel from two different sources, (a) from the reaction of boron
trichloride (BCl<sub>3</sub>) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) at 875K and
(b) from the decomposition of trimethylamine borate complex at
1200K. The infrared and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of BN from
both precursors agreed with the available data in the
literature. However BN powder from borane complex had a shifted XRD
peak due to the presence of carbonaceous material in the
structure. The BN powder-coated fuels were heated to 1400, 1525, and
1600K to sinter the BN. The examination under scanning electron
microscope showed that grainy, rod-shaped and layered BN coatings were
achieved. Rod-shaped structures were usually seen on gadolinia
fuels. The increased thickness of coating favors the formation of a
glassy looking layer. The BN from a borane complex seems to form a
layered structure more easily than the BN from BCl<sub>3</sub>. The BN
coated the surface of the fuels, and it did not penetrate into the
fuels.

<a name=7><b>Improvements in Boiling Water Reactor Uranium Utilization and Operating Experience with Burnup Increase</b><br></a>
<i>Takaaki Mochida, Katsumasa Haikawa, Jun-ichi Yamashita, Akira Nishimura, Yutaka Iwata, Shiroh Arai</i>
<p>

A boiling water reactor (BWR) core design for better uranium
utilization is presented, and its validity is demonstrated through
simulation and operation data. Together with the axial power
flattening obtained by an axially zoned enrichment core, uranium
utilization improvement techniques such as an axial blanket for
neutron leakage reduction, a low leakage loading pattern, an improved
local enrichment distribution in the fuel bundle, and spectral shift
operation method are promising design features to be applied to the
BWR core. Quantitative studies for the amount of burnup increase and
power peaking rise are made to estimate a level of effective uranium
utilization. The improvements in uranium utilization are confirmed not
only in the computational core design study, but also in empirical
data from a commercial BWR. Operating experience proves the adequacy
of the core design. A uranium utilization improvement of <img

<i>Shunji Homma, Mitsuhiro Takanashi, Jiro Koga, Shiro Matsumoto, Masaki Ozawa</i>
<p>

A new approach for evaluating the apparent equilibrium and rate
constants for the reaction of Np(V) with nitric acid by using the
process data of multistage countercurrent solvent extraction
experiments is proposed. The numerical simulation of neptunium
extraction in the co-decontamination process of the Purex process is
carried out on the assumption of the rate equation. The apparent
equilibrium and rate constants are determined by the nonlinear
least-squares method with experimental data for multistage
countercurrent solvent extraction with a numerical simulation
code. The determined apparent equilibrium and rate constants are 1.25
to 1.97 x 10<sup>-2</sup> min<sup>-1</sup> and 6.04 to 11.5 x
10<sup>-4</sup> (l/mol)<sup>3/2</sup>, respectively. These values are
consistent with those obtained in other kinetic studies.

intermediate-level waste repository is evaluated. The results of
experimental studies conducted to determine the radionuclide diffusion
coefficients and the hydraulic conductivities of calcium bentonite and
crushed granite mixtures are presented. The hydraulic conductivity of
the mixture is relatively low even at low dry density and clay
content, and the principal mechanism of radionuclide migration through
the mixture is diffusion. The measured values of apparent diffusion
coefficients in calcium bentonite with a dry density of 1.4
Mg/m<sup>3</sup> are of the order of 10<sup>-13</sup> to 10<sup>-12</sup>
m<sup>2</sup>/s for cations and 10<sup>-11</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s for
iodine. These values are similar to those in sodium bentonite.
<p>

The radionuclide release rates from the engineered barrier composed of
the concrete structure and the clay-based backfill were
calculated. Carbon-14 and <sup>99</sup>Tc are the important nuclides;
however, their maximum release rates are &lt;10<sup>-5</sup> GBq/yr. To
quantify the effect of uncertainties of input parameters on the
radionuclide release rates, Latin Hypercube sampling was used, and the
ranges of release rates were estimated statistically with a confidence
level of 95%. The uncertainties of the assessment results of the
radionuclide release rate are larger in the case of the sorbing
nuclides such as <sup>137</sup>Cs. Finally, the sensitivity of the
input parameter to release rate is also evaluated.


<h5>HEAT TRANSFER AND FLUID FLOW</h5>


<p>
<a name=10><b>Heat Removal Characteristics of a Primary Containment Vessel External Spray</b><br></a>
<i>Yoshiyuki Kataoka, Tadashi Fujii, Michio Murase</i>
<p>

To evaluate the heat release characteristics of a primary containment
vessel (PCV) external spray (one of the PCV cooling systems utilizing
the steel PCV wall as the heat transfer medium), the thermal-hydraulic
characteristics of the falling liquid film on the PCV surface have
been investigated experimentally. Then, the performance of the PCV
external spray cooling system was evaluated using the experimental
findings. The following results were obtained:

<ol>
  <li> Heat transfer coefficients of the falling liquid film under
       steady-state conditions were increased as the film flow rate
       per unit length of the liquid film width increased, and they
       agreed with Wilke's correlation within about <img
       src="/graphics/symbols/pminus.gif">15%.
  <li> The PCV surface temperature, when preheated up to 150
       <sup>o</sup>C, which is the supposed PCV temperature under a
       severe accident, decreased below 100 <sup>o</sup>C within a few
       seconds when the PCV external spray was initiated, and boiling
       on the PCV surface could not be maintained.
  <li> Heat transfer coefficients of the falling liquid film under
       transient conditions were higher initially due to the boiling
       effect; however, they decreased rapidly and approached those
       under steady-state conditions.
  <li> The PCV external spray for the conceptually designed PCV could
       suppress the PCV pressure below the design goal under a severe
       accident (failure of core cooling under low pressure). The
       maximum PCV pressure decreased as the spray flow rate increased
       and as the ratio of the PCV surface covered by the falling
       liquid film increased.
