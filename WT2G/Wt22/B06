<P>The preceding chapter discussed the structural features of teacher unions. Although we have not discussed the full range of union programs and services, the teacher unions need substantial revenue streams to sustain their operations. This chapter, therefore, is intended to provide an overview of union revenues. </P>
<P>  The NEA fiscal year begins September 1 and ends August 31 of each year; the AFT fiscal year is from July 1 through June 30. As labor organizations, each is organized under Section 501(c)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code and files IRS Form 990 annually. This designation exempts the unions from paying income tax, from paying certain state taxes (and the property tax in the case of the NEA), and from paying excise taxes. The Federal Election Campaign Act governs the national teacher union political action committees (PACs); federal committee reports are filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). State PAC organization and reporting requirements vary. In addition, both the NEA and the AFT file an annual labor organization report form (Form LM-2) which is filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. Table 3.1 shows NEA cash receipts and disbursements for the year ending August 31, 1992, as shown on the LM-2.</P>
<P>All data in Table 3.1 are for the national office only. Revenues and disbursements of state and local affiliates will be discussed later in this chapter.</P>
<P>Although the data in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 raise several unanswered questions, the following discussion may be adequate to explain how union operations are supported financially. We begin by reviewing budgeted receipts and disbursements of the general fund, one of several financial operations of the NEA. General Fund income is generated from three sources: 1) membership dues, 2) agency fees, and 3) external recoveries. </P>

<P>NEA member dues account for over 90 percent of its general fund income. The dues payments are transmitted monthly from the state or local affiliate to the national headquarters. NEA dues are based on a formula set forth in NEA Bylaw 2-7. Accordingly, Table 3.3 indicates anticipated membership and membership dues for 1993-94:</P>

<P>Obviously, maintaining its 2.1 million dues paying membership is crucial to NEA&#146;s finances. Until 1975, it was possible for teachers to be members of the local, state, or national association without necessarily paying dues at the other two levels. Typically, NEA membership was much lower than membership in the state associations and local associations were often primarily social organizations with minimal dues.</P>
<P>  The advent of collective bargaining changed the financial dynamics in several ways. With collective bargaining, there was imperative need for trained negotiators to represent local associations in bargaining and grievances. Local associations not large enough to pay for full-time representatives combined to support full-time union staff, usually a UniServ director. UniServ directors are union representatives who are funded partly from </P>

<P>NEA dues, but are not employed by the NEA. Instead, UniServ directors are legally employees of the state associations or local affiliates of the NEA. Most of the funds transmitted by the NEA to its state affiliates ($45 million in 1992-93) is for the UniServ program. UniServ salaries and working conditions are negotiated by the unions representing UniServ directors and the state associations. Table 3.4 shows the number of UniServ employees in the various regions. When fringe benefits are factored in, UniServ directors are paid $60,000 to $100,000.</P>
<P>In addition, the NEA operates six regional offices that employ field representatives who are NEA employees. These field representatives are represented by Association of Field Staff Employees (AFSE), which negotiates on their behalf with the NEA. These are also well-paid positions. As so often happens when unions are employers, the NEA pays its field representatives very generously. The field representatives argue that it would be hypocritical for them to urge school boards to provide certain benefits if the NEA itself did not provide them. Thus the NEA, like many other unions, provides extremely generous benefits to its employees&#151;so generous that the NEA does not publicize the salaries and dollar value of all employee benefits to NEA members.</P>

<P>Inasmuch as membership dues pay for most of NEA&#146;s budgeted programs, and most state and local programs as well, a union focus on dues is readily understandable. In order to illustrate the sophistication as well as the relentless nature of the union approach to dues, let us examine a stand-ard clause on the subject from a California school district:</P>
<P>ARTICLE XII</P>
<P>ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY AND PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS</P>
<P>1. Any employee who is a member of the Association who signs and delivers to the District an assignment authorizing deduction of unified membership dues, initiation fees and general assessments of the Association, or service fee (representation fee), shall have such authorization continue in effect from year to year unless revoked in writing between June 1 and September 1 of a given year. Any such revocation should be effective for the next school year. Pursuant to such authorization, the District shall deduct such dues, fees or assessments (or service fee) from the regular salary check, in ten (10) equal installments each year, for the duration of this Agreement.</P>
<P>2. The District will provide bargaining unit employees new to the District with a copy of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and the employee will sign a form, a copy of which will be forwarded to the Association within ten (10) days of the employee reporting to work.</P>
<P>3. Any employee who is a member of the Unit, who is not a member of the Association in good standing, or who does not make application for membership within thirty (30) days from the first day of active employment or July 1, 1981, whichever is later (except as provided hereafter in the Optional Procedure), shall pay a service fee to the Association: an amount equivalent to the United Membership dues, initiation fee and general assessments uniformly required to be paid by members of the Association.</P>
<P>4. In the event an employee fails to comply with this Article, at the request of the Association, the Superintendent or his designee shall notify the employee within (10) days that he/she is not complying with his/her contractual obligation to the Association and the District. A copy of such notice shall be sent to the Association.</P>
<P>5. The District shall deduct service fees from the salary or wage order of the employee who is not a member of the Association, or has not complied with the Optional Procedure.</P>
<P>   Any employee may pay service fees directly to the Association in lieu of having such service fees deducted from the salary or wage order.</P>
<P>   In the event that a unit member shall not pay such fee directly to the Association or authorize payment through payroll deduction as provided in paragraph 1, the Association shall so inform the District and the District shall immediately begin automatic payroll deduction in the same manner as set forth in paragraph 1 of this Article.</P>
<P>   Any payment to a charity must be made on an annual basis.</P>
<P>6. The parties further agree the obligation of this Article shall be grounded in the individual contract issues after July 1, 1981, for employees, which shall state&#151;&#147;this contract is subject to a collective bargaining agreement heretofore or hereafter negotiated by the District and the exclusive bargaining representative of employees employed by the District. The terms of such collective bargaining agreement are incorporated herein, and by accepting this contract, you agree to be bound by all such terms, including Article XII, Organizational Security and Payroll Deductions provisions thereof.&#148;</P>
<P>7. The District agrees promptly to remit such monies to the Association accompanied by an alphabetical list of employees for whom such deductions have been made.</P>
<P>8. The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the District to fulfill the provisions of this Article.</P>
<P>9. Upon appropriate written authorization from the employee, the District shall deduct from the salary of any employee and make appropriate remittance for annuities, credit union, and savings bonds. Deductions for any other plans or programs shall be jointly approved by the Association and the District.</P>
<P>10. Dues Checkoff&#151;Authorization in effect on date of the signing of this Agreement shall remain in effect but shall be subject to the conditions set forth in this Article.</P>
<P>11. The Modesto Teachers Association agrees to indemnify and hold the District harmless from any and all claims arising from a bargaining unit member represented by the Modesto Teachers Association concerning the implementation of Article XII provided such implementation is done by the District in good faith and in a non-negligent manner. In such case, the Modesto Teachers Association shall have the exclusive right to defend such suits and to determine which matters shall be compromised, resisted, tried, or appealed.</P>
<P>12. The District agrees to deduct dues or service fees pursuant to the schedule submitted by MTA for employees who execute a form currently in use or any mutually agreed upon form. The MTA is to submit the schedule each year by September 5. The schedule may be amended once each school year with thirty (30) days notice.</P>
<P>OPTIONAL PROCEDURE</P>
<P>13.<I> </I><I>Exclusive optional procedure effective upon final ratification of the 1990-92 Collective </I><I>Bargaining Agreement applicable to employees hired to commence service to the District thereafter </I><I>and to employees employed before that date who were members of the Association or who were </I><I>paying a service fee to the Association.</I></P>
<P>   Any employee of this unit who has bona fide religious beliefs which prohibit him/her from joining or financially supporting employee organizations shall not be required to join or financially support Modesto Teachers Association CTA/NEA. However, that employee shall utilize the following Optional Procedure:</P>
<P>a. submit a notarized statement to the Association with a copy to the employer by the end of the first month (September) of each school year. The statement shall state that the person does not desire to join or contribute to the Modesto Teachers Association because of religious beliefs that prevent him/her from joining or contributing.</P>
<P>b. Make payment equal to unified membership dues to a non-
<BR>religious, non-labor organization exempted under Section 501 (c)(3) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code. The list of designated charitable organizations is: Heart Fund, Cancer Fund, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation or others approved by the Association.</P>
<P>c. Proof of such payment (i.e., payment to one of the charities on the list of designated charities) shall be submitted to the Association with a copy to the District by the end of the first month of each school year (September).</P>
<P>   Upon final ratification of the 1990-92 Collective Bargaining Agreement, this procedure is applicable only to employees who have elected to not join in financial support of Modesto Teachers Association CTA/NEA based on personal beliefs and who annually continue to exercise that option.*</P>
<P>A close examination of Article XII of the Modesto contract shows that it is much more convenient to pay the dues than it is not to pay them. Paragraph 1 continues the authorization in effect from year to year. The revocation must be in writing and submitted between June 1 and September 1, a period of time in which most teachers are not in school. Actually, the window in which a teacher can resign is not very helpful even to those who might wish to use it. One of the union&#146;s main functions, if not the major one, is to negotiate a contract. In many situations the contracts are not completed until after the beginning of the school year. When and where this is the case, the teachers have lost their most effective way to object to the union&#146;s performance&#151;they can no longer withdraw their financial support for the union.</P>
<P>The 1993-94 unified dues in this district were $640; local dues $165, state (CTA) dues $376, and national (NEA) $99. Ostensibly, the contract allows teachers to revoke the dues deduction; note, however, that it does not allow them to avoid paying an amount equivalent to regular dues assessments and initiation fees. This is clearly stated in paragraphs 3 and 5 which will be discussed shortly. If the teacher does not pay, the union merely notifies the district, and the district is contractually obligated to deduct the amount from the teacher&#146;s pay.</P>
<P>*All School district contracts in California are public records. The Modesto contract is cited here because it also illustrates the importance of a long-range perspective on teacher bargaining. When one of the authors (ML) was employed by the Modesto board of education in the 1970s, the MTA contract did not include a service fee requirement. After several years of hard bargaining by the MTA, and a strike, the service fee was included. The service fee provisions illustrate the fact that the concessions school boards often make to achieve an immediate agreement often strengthen the union&#146;s ability to extract even more concessions from the board later on.</P>
<P>The Optional Procedure also illustrates the minimal concern for teacher rights on issues pertaining to dues. A relatively small group of teachers has or may have religious objections to paying dues or service fees to the union.</P>
<P>Such bona fide objections do not release the teachers from an obligation to pay; they serve only to release the teacher from an obligation to pay the union. So the teacher has to pay, but to whom? The designated list of charities is extremely narrow, but cannot be expanded without union approval (section 13b). Finally, to safeguard against the possibility that teachers might drop their religious objections but continue to avoid payment, (section 13c) requires that the optional procedure be repeated every year, or the teacher pays the union. Parenthetically, it should be noted that one reason the unions are so adamant about restricting the religious objections is that the union receives no income from the religious objector. Unlike the teachers who object on religious grounds, objectors on other grounds must still pay the service fee to the union.</P>
<P>The union&#146;s emphasis on dues and service fees is further illustrated by Paragraph 7, which ensures that there will be no float accruing to the district, and that the union will be able to identify non-payers immediately. Paragraph 9 ensures that there will be no payroll deduction for any plans or programs opposed by the union. New employees will not be able to assert lack of awareness of Article XII as a basis for challenging the dues deduction.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>NEA Service (Agency) Fees</FONT></A></H5>
<P>Another important source of union revenues is compulsory payment of fees by nonmembers of the union. Such fees are widely referred to as &#147;serv-ice fees&#148; or &#147;agency shop&#148; or &#147;fair share fees&#148;; the former terminology will be used here. Paragraph 3, 4, and 5 of the Modesto contract illustrate the contractual provisions governing service fees. Inasmuch as these paragraphs are fairly typical, we shall cite them to clarify the issues.</P>
<P>The basic public policy issue can be stated as follows: Should public policy require, tolerate, or prohibit service fees? State legislators might adopt any of these divergent answers. Where the states allow but do not mandate service fees, the public policy question is also a bargaining issue at the table. In effect, the state legislatures have referred the public policy issue to local school boards, which must then decide what to do about it.</P>
<P>Although it is impossible to ascertain the precise amount of union revenues that results from service fees, they are an important source of union revenues. In the 21 right-to-work states, service fees are not allowed. In the states where such fees are allowed, the union must negotiate the inclusion of a service fee in the contract, and the amount varies from district to district and state to state. As a matter of fact, even the unions might have difficulty assessing the amount of union revenue resulting from service fee clauses in contracts. The reason is that some union income from membership dues actually results from service fee clauses in the contract. Teachers who pay service fees are not union members and do not participate in union affairs; for instance, they cannot vote on whether to accept proposed contracts with the school board unless the union allows them to do so. Where the service fee is equivalent to dues, some teachers become union members and pay the full amount of union dues.</P>
<P>Interestingly enough, in Table 3.3 the 1993-94 NEA budgets show 23,000 agency fee payers, and estimate union income therefrom to be $2,208,000. This comes to $96 per payor, just to the NEA; inasmuch as the service fees must also be paid to state and local associations, the total amounts extracted from nonmembers is several times this amount. Needless to say, the AFT also relies on service fees to generate a significant amount of union income.</P>
<P>In the NEA budget, agency fees provide 1.3 percent of the NEA&#146;s membership income. What this means, however, is that service fees are a much higher proportion of union income in the states that allow or require such fees. The NEA figures on revenues from service fees are for all of the states combined; if, as is the case, almost half the states do not allow service fees, the fees must be a substantially higher percentage of NEA income in the states that allow them.</P>
<P>The union rationale for service fees is that members of the bargaining unit should not receive the benefits of representation without paying their &#147;fair share&#148; of its costs. This rationale is based on the fact that when a union becomes the exclusive representative, it must represent everyone in the bargaining unit, whether or not the individuals are members of the union. Thus the interests of the employees are to be &#147;free riders,&#148; that is, to receive the benefits of representation without paying for the union services that supposedly were responsible for them.</P>
<P>There are several objections to this rationale. Obviously, if a union did not seek exclusive representation, it would have no right to force nonmembers to pay for the union&#146;s services. In practice, the unions demanded the right to represent everyone, and then, having achieved this right, cited it as a reason to force nonmembers to pay the service fee. It is as if someone painted your house against your wishes, and then demanded that you pay for the service so that you would not be a &#147;free rider.&#148;</P>
<P>The most basic objection to service fees is that they violate the rights of individuals to contract for their labor. In effect, collective bargaining forces individuals to accept representation they may not want and terms and conditions of employment that may not be as good as those that could be negotiated individually. Unquestionably, many individuals are worse off as a result of union representation; for example, mathematics and science teachers could often negotiate higher salaries for themselves if they were not tied to the salary schedule for all teachers. In any event, the vast majority of persons would strenuously object to being compelled to buy a service because the vendor insisted that the benefits outweighed the costs. Benefits are supposed to be evaluated by the potential buyer, not by the party who compels the alleged beneficiary to pay for them.</P>
<P>At bargaining tables, school boards face strong temptations to agree to service fees. The teacher unions accord such clauses a high priority and will typically offer valuable concessions for board agreement to a service fee. Such quid pro quo&#146;s are very attractive to school boards because individual teachers, not the boards, pay for the concession. Furthermore, by agreeing to a service fee, the board is discouraging support for a rival union which might challenge the incumbent union for not extracting enough concessions from the board. With a service fee, incumbent unions need not fear defections so much if they agree to board proposals that are highly unpopular among the teachers. If teachers have to pay a service fee regardless of other considerations, the union does not lose so much revenue by agreeing to unpopular board proposals.</P>
<P>In states which do not mandate or prohibit service fees, the public policy issues must be faced at the district level. The local district is faced with a dilemma: It can protect the rights of individual teachers or it can sacrifice them for union concessions on other matters. Whatever one&#146;s view of the dilemma, many boards have opted for the concessions from the union instead of protection for all teachers in the bargaining unit.</P>
<P>What are the employee&#146;s options at this point? To put it mildly, they are not very attractive. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of service fees, but it has also held that the fees must be limited to the employee&#146;s pro rata share of the costs of bargaining and processing grievances. It has also upheld the union position that nonmembers can be charged for the costs incurred by the state and national organization for these purposes. Clearly, the Modesto contractual language quoted above requires nonmembers to pay more than is constitutionally permissible. In practice, however, the teacher must initiate a grievance or lawsuit to get a rebate of the excess deduction.</P>
<P>For purposes of discussion, let us assume that a teacher would be entitled to $150 if his or her objection to the service fee were legally sustained. The teacher union has an enormous stake in defeating or minimizing the rebate; thus it employs a phalanx of attorneys prepared to argue the union position at every step of the case. Meanwhile, the teacher faces a quandary. How much time and money should be invested in getting the rebate? At least from a financial point of view, it does not make sense to invest $5,000 or $1,000 or even $150 in the chance to regain the $150 that has been wrongfully deducted from the teacher&#146;s paycheck. Without access to pro bono legal services, the teacher is extremely unlikely to challenge the excessive deduction even though it would be invalidated if carried to a definitive legal decision. The National Right To Work Committee (NRTWC) provides such legal services upon request. NRTWC attorneys experienced in California agency shop litigation estimate that 7-10,000 California teachers are not members of AFT or NEA; of these, only about 1,500-2,000 initiate grievances or lawsuits to get a rebate.</P>
<P>The foregoing analysis actually understates the obstacles for nonpayment of union dues or service fees. For instance, California school boards can agree to a maintenance of membership clause. Under such a clause, teachers who are members of the union must maintain their membership in it until a certain number of days before the expiration of the contract; 30 days before the contract expires would be the window in California. In districts that have agreed to maintenance of membership, teachers cannot resign from membership until the window period. If a teacher has just been employed and joins the union, the teacher must remain a member until the window period, which may be almost three years in the future; the teacher cannot avoid payment of union dues and assessments prior to the window period.</P>
<P>School boards that accept service fees face complex problems of implementation. One is the amount of the fee. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the fee must be the individual&#146;s pro rata share of the costs of bargaining and processing grievances; in theory, nonmembers cannot be assessed for other union activities. Logically, this means that the service fees must be less than regular union dues and assessments, but teacher unions nevertheless still collect regular dues and assessments as a &#147;service fee&#148; in many school districts. Needless to say, the unions have a very expansive view of what expenditures are for bargaining and grievance handling; opponents of serv-ice fees have a more restrictive view of these matters. Understandably, litigation over this issue is widespread, especially since the proportion of union expenditures for bargaining and grievance handling can vary widely from time to time and district to district.</P>
<P>Implementation of service fee agreements raises several other issues which cannot be discussed here. Among them are the following:</P>
<P>1. The procedures for assessing the amount of the service fees.</P>
<P>2. The procedures for challenging the fees and seeking review for fees  already paid.</P>
<P>3. The use that can be made of fees that have been paid but challenged.</P>
<P>4. Who bears the cost of challenges to service fees.</P>
<P>5. School board liability for service fees that violate employees&#146; constitutional rights.</P>
<P>6. The information that unions must provide upon request to payors of service fees.</P>
<P>7. Whether the service fees apply only to the local union that is the exclusive representative, or may also include the teacher&#146;s share of the costs of the state and national affiliates that provide bargaining assistance to the local unions.</P>
<P>8. Who has the burden of proof on which issues in litigation involving service fees.</P>
<P>To illustrate the complexity of these matters, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the costs of preparation for an illegal strike can be counted as expenditures requiring payment of a &#147;fair share&#148; by nonmembers under a service fee. Given such decisions, it is hardly any wonder that service fees are a source of continuing confusion and litigation among all parties interested in the issue. As the foregoing discussion indicates, however, the stakes in this litigation are very large indeed for the teacher unions. Membership dues and service fees for 1993-94 just for the NEA, exclusive of the much larger amounts going to its state and local affiliates and other unions such as the AFT, were estimated to generate $172,756,000, almost $18 million more than the 1991-92 revenues from these sources. Needless to say, the larger the revenue stream from service fees, the more difficult it will be to limit the union income from this source.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>External Recoveries</FONT></A></H5>
<P>In addition to dues from members and service fees from nonmembers, the NEA also receives income from sources outside the Association. For 1993-94 these funds were reflected in the budget as reimbursements from state affiliates for jointly funded executive director positions, advertising in NEA publications, rebates, sales of library materials, and exhibit booth and conference center rentals.

<P>Delegates at the 1993 Representative Assembly in San Francisco approved the 1993-1994 general fund budget of $173,206,000, an amount far exceeding the income and expenditures of any other professional organization. However, the $8 million income from sources outside the NEA as shown above was not included as part of the general fund income; instead, NEA accounting procedures show the external recovery funds as an offset to program costs. In short, both the NEA&#146;s total income and total expenditure figures omitted the amounts from external recoveries. Clearly, however, the 1993-94 NEA general fund income budget was over $181 million.</P>

<P>NEA 1993-94 additional budget expenditures</P>
<TD>
<P> $8,186,411</P></TABLE>
<P>NEA estimates that approximately 36 percent of its budget is returned to state and local affiliates through the UniServ Program (20 percent); Unified Legal Services Program (9.8 percent) and other projects (6.2 percent). It should be noted that the NEA receives funds from state and local affiliates and also allocates funds to them for programs that are cooperatively administered.</P>
<P>The usefulness of these figures is highly debatable; our view is that they are not informative for several reasons. One is that certain objectives are funded from several budget lines. Collective bargaining services to local affiliates may require expenditures by legal counsel, research, communications, and several other programs and services. Another problem is that budget information is often presented in ways that obscure rather than reveal information members might wish to have. For instance, most NEA members probably believe that the salaries of the NEA executive officers in 1993-94 were as follows:</P>
<P>        </P>
<TABLE>

<TD>
<P>President</P>

<TD>
<P>Secretary/Treasurer</P>
<TD>
<P> $145,410</P></TABLE>
<P> </P>
<P>   </P>
<P>However, in addition, the executive officers receive the following:</P>
<P>1.<I> </I><I>A living allowance based on 20 percent of salary.</I> The justification for this is not clear. It may have originated when NEA officers were elected for one year terms but would hardly be applicable to offi-cers who may spend six or more years in Washington. Justification aside, inasmuch as the allowance is provided without restriction, it seems misleading to exclude it from the salary figures.</P>
<P>2.<I> </I><I>A 20 percent fringe benefit allowance. </I>The fringe benefit allowance is in addition to the living allowance. The NEA executive officers can but are not required to participate in the NEA&#146;s health insurance plan; the $20,000 allowance is supposed to enable them to make their own arrangements for health insurance. Here again, the issue being raised is member knowledge about the situation.</P>
<P>If an NEA president gives up his or her position in the individual&#146;s home state, there is no reason why the individual should receive a living allowance. If the president maintains his or her position in the individual&#146;s school district, the president is likely to be covered by the district&#146;s health insurance and retirement system. For that matter, the NEA president and president&#146;s family may be covered by spousal health insurance.</P>
<P>In addition to the 40 percent additional ($66,000 in 1993-94) the NEA president receives several other benefits.</P>
<P>1. Tax preparation at NEA expense</P>
<P>2. Travel for a companion to the annual convention and to one international conference</P>
<P>3. Moving expenses</P>
<P>The point to be made is not whether the NEA president should receive these benefits; it is that the members simply do not know the total compensation paid to their officers. The additional items cited above may not be exhaustive, but add about $75,000 in toto to presidential compensation, which can be treated as ordinary income. We do not know whether NEA members care what the NEA president receives annually in salary and bene-fits; our point is that unless the members know, there is no way to assess their reactions. Parenthetically, we note that in a paid advertisement in the <I>Washington Post</I>, NEA President Keith Geiger repeatedly urged the nation &#147;to move beyond the profit motive,&#148; to enact gun control. Geiger went on to approve Martin Luther King&#146;s statement that <I>&#147;our economy must </I><I>become more person centered and less profit centered &#148;</I> (Geiger, 1994).</P>
<P>Similarly, the budget documents given to NEA convention delegates show that just over $152 million has been set aside for retirement benefits for NEA staff. These benefits ordinarily vest after five years of NEA service. Is $152 million appropriate? To answer this question, members need to know the number of beneficiaries of the $152 million, but this information (about 1,200) is not provided in the budget documents. Indeed, even knowing the number of beneficiaries and how much in toto has been set aside for their retirement benefits is not sufficient information for budgetary purposes. Information about the trends in retirement costs and the projections would also appear to be essential for informed judgment. Will the NEA have an entitlement problem, similar to the entitlement problems of Medicare and Social Security? The NEA&#146;s budget documents do not provide adequate information for the delegate who is or may be concerned about the issue.</P>

<B> NEA special purpose funds</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>NEA has special purpose funds in addition to the General Fund. Restricted funds are designated for specific projects and purposes for members and employees. The special purpose funds vary in the extent of direct NEA control, their magnitude, tax status, beneficiaries and funding mechanisms. In addition to the funds which support the UniServ operation, the following eight special purpose funds illustrate the complexity of NEA financial operations.</P>
<P>1. <I>NEA-Retired Program Fund</I></P>
<P> For over 10 years the NEA has offered retired life memberships through a special purpose fund known as the NEA-Retired Program. Payments to the fund qualify retired members for several services such as pre-retirement seminars and publications. The NEA-Retired Program Fund for members records payments to the fund as deferred income when received and amortizes them over the estimated life expectancy of its NEA retired members. As of August 31, 1992 the balance in this fund was $2,710,882.</P>
<P>2.<I> </I><I>The Member Benefits Corporation (MBC)</I></P>
<P> The Member Benefits Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NEA, administers several special membership services. As of August 31, 1992, MBC had total assets of $2,163,663.</P>
<P>3.<I> </I><I>NEA Members Insurance Trust</I></P>
<P> As part of NEA Special Services, the NEA Members Insurance Trust is a separate tax exempt organization, which also reports income and expenditures. For the year ended August 31, 1992, the NEA Members Insurance Trust had total assets of $88,159,667.</P>
<P>4. <I>Defined Benefit Retirement Plan</I></P>
<P> Substantially all NEA permanent employees are covered by its Defined Benefit Retirement Plan which includes some employees from state and local affiliates. The defined benefit retirement fund had net assets available for benefits of $152,232,340 as of January 1, 1992.</P>
<P>5. <I>401(k) Salary Reduction Plan</I></P>
<P> NEA contributes to a 401(k) salary reduction plan based on a set percentage of employee contributions. For the years ended August 31, 1992, NEA contributed $903,131.</P>
<P>6. <I>NEA Post-Retirement Health Care Benefits</I></P>
<P> As of August 31, 1992, NEA had accrued approximately $7,900,000 to provide post-retirement health care benefits for its present retirees and eligible active employees upon retirement.</P>
<P>7. <I>NEA Foundation Funds</I></P>
<P> In 1969 NEA created the National Foundation for the Improvement in Education (NFIE). As a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization, NFIE receives gifts and grants from private foundations, individuals, corporations, and the government. In the 1980s NFIE&#146;s board of directors converted it from a grant-seeking organization to an endowed foundation now engaged in grant-giving. With NEA and substantial corporate support, NFIE has accumulated assets of nearly $11,000,000.</P>
<P>   NFIE&#146;s Annual Report lists contributions from NEA, corporations, individuals and private foundations; a partial list includes:</P>
<P>   Apple Computer, Inc.  The Johnson Foundation </P>
<P>   ARCO Foundation   MBNA American Bank, NA </P>
<P>   Ashland Oil Foundation  New England Telephone. </P>
<P>   The Bell Atlantic Charitable   NIKE  Inc. </P>
<P>     Foundation  The NYNEX Foundation </P>
<P>   The BellSouth Foundation  The Pacific Telesis Foundation  </P>
<P>   The Bristol-Meyers Squibb Foundation   The Prudential Foundation </P>
<P>   Citibank  The RJR/Nabisco Foundation  </P>
<P>   The Danforth Foundation   Sega Youth Ed. and Health </P>
<P>   Digital Equipment Corporation    Foundation  </P>
<P>   Edison Electric Institute  Student Loan Marketing Assn  </P>
<P>   The Edna McConnell Clark   Southern New England </P>
<P>     Foundation    Telephone  </P>
<P>   GTE Service Corporation   Time Warner, Inc. </P>
<P>   The Hitachi Foundation  United Resources </P>
<P>   The Horace Mann Ins. Companies   The US West Foundation  </P>
<P>   IBM Corporation   Xerox Corporation </P>
<P> These funds are used to sponsor regional conferences, state instructional and professional development conferences, publications, television programming, video programs, media efforts, and other outreach programs in every region of the country. NFIE is governed by an 18 member board of directors that includes the NEA president, the NEA past president, the NEA executive director, other academics and corporate executives.</P>
<P>8. <I>NEA-PAC</I></P>
<P> In 1972, the NEA established the National Education Association Political Action Committee (NEA-PAC) as a separate fund to support its endorsed candidates for national office. NEA-PAC generated over $4 million in 1991-92 and spent almost $6 million during the 1992 election cycle. We discuss NEA-PAC funding, political activities and details of state and local teacher union PACs in Chapter 4.</P>
<P>In practice, it is impossible to determine from budget figures how much the NEA spends on various activities and programs. This is due partly to the fact that the budgeted amounts often refer to expenses incurred by one unit to facilitate the objectives or operations of several others. For example, legal counsel may be called upon for collective bargaining with staff unions, NEA&#146;s tax exemptions, contracts with vendors, drafting legislation, and a host of other activities shown as receiving specified budget amounts. In addition, several NEA activities are carried on by its wholly owned subsidiaries, such as the Member Benefits Corporation. Without the budgetary information from these subsidiaries, it is impossible to ascertain the amounts actually spent for certain programs. On the other hand, the reason for their exclusion from the regular budget may be to avoid full disclosure of their operations. We shall come back to this issue in the next chapter, but it is a
<BR>major obstacle to full understanding of NEA governance and financial operations.</P>

<P>Table 3.5 shows the AFT&#146;s cash receipts and disbursements for the year ending June 30, 1992, as shown on Form LM-2.</P>
<P>Like the NEA, over 90 percent of the AFT&#146;s annual revenues are derived from a per capita tax and service fees which totaled $67,740,516 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992. In 1992 the AFT convention approved a $.40 per-capita, per month increase, beginning September 1, 1992 and an additional $.40 per member per month, beginning September 1, 1993. These increases raised the per capita tax to $8.55 per month per member. AFT&#146;s other income is derived from sources similar to NEA&#146;s sources of additional revenues:</P>

<P>Pursuant to the bylaws, the AFT Executive Council is charged with preparing and adopting the annual budget.

<P>4. <I>AFT Educational Foundation</I></P>
<P> The American Federation of Teachers Educational Foundation is an AFT subsidiary which conducts and sponsors educational research. As with AFT/COPE, the foundation shares the same execu-tive council that presides over it and the AFT. Financial opera-
<BR>tions of the foundation are included in the budget funds discussed above.</P>
<P>5.<I> </I><I>The American Nurses Foundation, Inc.</I></P>
<P> The American Nurses Foundation, Inc. represents more than 50,000 nurses and other health professionals, the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals (FNHP) and is an affiliate of the AFT. Receipts and disbursements of FNHP are included in the budget information already discussed. However, a separate not-for-profit corporation was established to educate its members and leaders on all new health care proposals before Congress, as well as health and safety standards, and administer grant funds. Health care workshops and seminars, training and organizing assistance programs are targeted and budgeted separately. Five members of the Foundation&#146;s nine-member board of trustees were also members of the American Nurses Association, which provides staff and other support for the foundation. In addition, the group has a separate PAC which contributed $288,498 to political candidates in the 1991-92 election cycle.</P>
<P>6. <I>AFT/COPE</I></P>
<P> Funds for the AFT Committee on Political Education (COPE) must be kept separate from union funds. As its political action committee, AFT/COPE funds are the union&#146;s political vehicle operating at the local, state, and national levels of government. Two types of funds may be used for political action: union treasury funds (soft money) and political action funds (hard money). Generally, union treasury funds (dues and fees, sometimes called &#147;soft money&#148;) can be used to raise money for COPE, to communicate political endorsements and other candidate information to members, and for direct contributions to candidates for local and state offices. Some state laws limit political expenditures to candidates and require COPE committee reports. Federal law considers the COPE committees of AFT locals, state federations and the AFT itself, to be related committees and limits the combined expenditures of all three in federal contests. Therefore, any affiliate COPE committee which becomes involved in campaigns for federal office must coordinate contributions through AFT/COPE to comply with campaign contribution limits. This procedure also eliminates the necessity of separate filing requirements for the affiliates, as AFT/COPE files the required federal reports.</P>
<P>   We have included a discussion of AFT/COPE in the political activities of the teacher unions in Chapter 4.</P>

<B> Union revenues and merger</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>Historically, the strength of the NEA was in its state affiliates; they received and spent most of the dues income. In the AFT most of the dues revenue stayed in the local, relatively little went to the state and national offices. This reflected the fact that the AFT was predominantly a large city union, and unions in large cities require substantial funds. Meanwhile, AFT state affiliates typically lacked the local affiliates and revenues to be a major player in the state legislatures.</P>
<P>For 1993-94, the national dues of the two unions were $99 for the NEA and from $100 to $135 for the AFT, a difference that would not pose any merger problem. State dues might constitute a problem if the AFT&#146;s high local dues were combined with the high state dues of some of NEA state affiliates. In all likelihood, the emerging dues structure will be a compromise between the NEA emphasis on the state and the AFT emphasis on local dues.</P>
<P>We do not have comprehensive data on the finances of the state and local teacher unions, especially of state teacher union PACs. In view of the tremendous amounts raised by some, and their inadequate reporting and disclosure requirements, the annual income of local, state, and national teacher unions from all sources is probably over $1 billion, but it may be a long way from having reached its peak.</P>
<P>A major legislative thrust, with or without merger, will be the enactment of legislation that requires automatic payment of service fees to the exclusive representative, instead of having to negotiate such fees district by district. The teacher unions, in conjunction with other unions representing state and local employees will try, and often succeed in enacting mandatory service fees. In that case, school districts will lose the leverage of being able to grant or withhold agency shop, and the school district employees will lose the leverage associated with nonpayment of dues or service fees. School districts will have to deduct the service fee from the first paycheck to the last one, and we can expect a quantum increase in union revenues.</P>

<P>What are the political objectives of the teacher unions? How do they try to achieve their political objectives? How effective are their political operations? This chapter and the next one attempt to answer these questions. In many respects, they are among the most important questions raised 
<BR>in this book. As will be evident, our analysis is not comprehensive, 
<BR>but it may serve to demonstrate the impressive political influence of teacher unions.</P>

<B> The NEA&#146;s legislative program</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The NEA&#146;s legislative program is prepared by its Standing Committee on Legislation after an extensive process of eliciting member views. The Committee conducts open hearings at regional leadership conferences and solicits the views of various sub-units, such as the National Council of Urban Education Associations, the Education Support Personnel, and Higher Education. The 11-member Standing Committee on Legislation submits its recommendations to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors; the latter is responsible for recommending the legislative program to the Representative Assembly, which considers, amends, and adopts the program as it deems appropriate. The Committee is then responsible for monitoring implementation of the program throughout the year.</P>
<P>The legislative program is categorized into three tiers that reflect the levels of resources to be utilized within each category (<I>NEA Handbook</I>, 1993-94).</P>
<P><B>First Tier</B></P>
<P><I>NEA Priority Legislative Initiatives</I> are legislative issues initiated by NEA &#147;that require continuing high activity levels to accomplish the goal.&#148; The two items in the First Tier, increased federal funding for public schools and postsecondary education and collective bargaining rights for NEA members at all levels of education, can be characterized as issues on which NEA is the principal advocate.</P>
<P><B>Second Tier</B></P>
<P><I>Current Priority Congressional Issues</I> are &#147;legislative issues requiring 
<BR>NEA, singly or through coalitions, to initiate intensive activity to advance NEA&#146;s objectives.&#148; These second tier priorities include federal funding in 18 of 20 targeted legislative areas, such as early childhood programs,HIV research, a tax-supported single payer health care plan, statehood for the District of Columbia, sustained Medicare/Medicaid benefits, full funding for federally mandated educational services for individuals with disabilities, improved Social Security benefits, expanded drug treatmentand rehabilitation programs, and partial public funding of federal election campaigns.</P>
<P><B>Third Tier</B></P>
<P><I>NEA Ongoing Legislative Concerns</I> are &#147;legislative issues constantly monitored by NEA that require appropriate NEA activity&#148; as developments occur. Federal funding of assistance to local school districts for computer equipment and software purchases, adequate public financing for public broadcasting, continuation of the U.S. Department of Education, and repeal of the right-to-work provision of federal labor law are included in the third tier agenda.</P>
<P>The NEA&#146;s legislative program serves as a guide for planning and action by NEA in lobbying Congress, presenting the views of the membership to federal agencies, and working in coalition with like-minded national organ-izations to attain NEA legislative goals. Moreover, the legislative program provides the core of the NEA-PAC questionnaire used to evaluate candidates for federal office, and it serves as the basis for the NEA Legislative Report Card assessing the voting record of federal officeholders (<I>Reports of Committees,</I> 1993).</P>

<B> NEA Structure for political action</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>Formally at least, the NEA&#146;s legislative objectives are set by the Representative Assembly (RA). Practically, it is impossible for the RA to set all the priorities, allocate funds for each objective, assign staff to lobby as circumstances change, and to perform all the other tasks required to implement the NEA&#146;s legislative program. These tasks are distributed to various units within the NEA along the following lines.</P>
<P>The NEA operates with an executive director who supervises the work of six assistant executive directors. Political activities generally are the responsibility of the assistant executive director of the Center for Public Affairs, who administers and coordinates the following NEA units:</P>
<P>                  Communications</P>
<P>                  Government Relations</P>
<P>                  NEA-PAC</P>
<P>                  Publishing</P>
<P>                  Health Information Network</P>
<P>Although their political activities vary, all are essential to effective political operations. For example, Communications prepares news releases, arranges press conferences, handles requests for interviews and information, and operates a broadcast studio for video productions and teleconferences.</P>
<H5><A ID="I4" NAME="I4">
<FONT SIZE=4>The NEA&#146;s Government Relations Program</FONT></A></H5>
<P>Government Relations is the NEA unit most directly responsible for advancing the NEA&#146;s legislative program. According to the NEA Handbook,</P>
<P><I>Government Relations carries lead responsibility for organizing and training NEA members to elect </I><I>pro-education candidates to federal office, influencing the executive branch in its development of </I><I>legislative proposals and its regulation of programs of interest to NEA; working with organizations </I><I>of education policymakers at the state, regional and local levels to adopt positions compatible with </I><I>NEA&#146;s, and advancing NEA&#146;s Legislative Program in Congress. To implement its broad agenda, </I><I>Government Relations comprises the following sections: Federal Relations, Political Advocacy, </I><I>Information Services, Field Services, and Administration.</I></P>
<P>In addition to a staff of 31 at NEA headquarters, Government Relations operates field offices in Washington, DC and Colorado. Essentially, Government Relations is directly responsible for lobbying, identifying and supporting candidates for federal office who support NEA policies, training state and local staff and members on political issues, strategy, and 
<BR>tactics, tracking the progress of legislation of interest to NEA, polling, research and information. Government Relations is also responsible for NEA relations with the Democratic and Republican parties and for implementing NEA positions on issues that cut across party lines, such as redistricting. It is also responsible for developing a unified government relations program in each state and for consultant services to state and local affiliates on political matters. In addition, Government Relations also administers NEA-PAC, the association&#146;s political action arm nationwide. We turn next to this extremely important dimension of NEA political operations.</P>
<H5><A ID="I5" NAME="I5">
<FONT SIZE=4>The NEA Political Action Committee (NEA-PAC)</FONT></A></H5>
<P>Political action committees emerged in the 1940s when labor unions were prohibited from spending regular union funds for candidates for federal office. Instead, the practice of pooling political contributions from members and presenting the funds to the candidates became the conventional way to contribute cash to candidates endorsed by the unions. Even though federal restrictions discouraged many groups from setting up their own committees, the idea appealed not only to labor unions, but to business and ideological groups as well. With the establishment of NEA-PAC in 1972, the NEA became the first education association to organize a national political action committee.</P>
<P>In 1974 Congress passed several amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act, officially sanctioning the concept of political committees. Soon thereafter, the great PAC rush began, and endorsements, contributions, and volunteers began flowing to favored candidates and causes. 
<BR>In recent years, the number of national political action committees 
<BR>(about 4,000 as of July, 1993) has stabilized, and even begun to de-
<BR>cline. Although total PAC dollars have also stabilized, the amounts going to incumbents continues to rise with each new election (Makinson, 1990). NEA-PAC participated in this trend. By 1988 annual contributions to NEA-PAC reached $3.1 million; only the National Association of Realtors, the American Medical Association, and the Teamsters had larger PAC funds. In the 1991-92 federal election cycle NEA-PAC raised almost $4.5 million.</P>
<P>NEA-PAC&#146;s objective is to elect candidates who support federal legislation consistent with the policies established by the Representative Assembly. To achieve this objective, NEA-PAC contributes financially to endorsed candidates and encourages members to volunteer services to the campaigns. NEA-PAC endorsement may be given only to a congressional candidate whose endorsement is recommended by the appropriate body in the state affiliate. Establishing separate state PACs for the same purposes at the state and local level is encouraged and supported by the national organization. In 1992 virtually all of the NEA&#146;s state organizations and many of its 13,000 local affiliates made campaign contributions through political action committees.</P>
<P>Each state affiliate is represented on NEA-PAC. Other members of NEA-PAC are representatives of the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee, minority caucuses, the Higher Education Caucus, the Women&#146;s Caucus, the Caucus of Educators of Exceptional Children (CEEC), Advisory Committee of Student Members, educational support personnel, NEA-Retired, and the National Council of Urban Education Associations (NCUEA).</P>
<P>NEA-PAC is responsible for screening U.S. presidential candidates and recommending endorsement of candidates to the Representative Assembly. The RA then decides which candidates, if any, to endorse in presidential elections. The NEA has been a major supporter of Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, when it played a leading role in the Carter-Mondale campaign. Carter thereupon vigorously supported legislation creating a U.S. Department of Education, a longtime NEA goal. Significantly, NEA members have been the single largest block of delegates at every Democratic convention since 1980. At the 1992 Democratic convention, 512 of 4,288 delegates were NEA or AFT members.</P>
<P><I>NEA-PAC Fundraising Procedures and Results</I>. Initially, NEA-PAC 
<BR>was supported by a &#147;reverse checkoff&#148; system. Essentially, under the reverse checkoff, a certain amount is deducted from teacher paychecks for the teacher PAC. The teacher who does not want to contribute to it must take some action to avoid the deduction or to have the money refunded. In other words, instead of requiring teacher assent to a deduction from teacher paychecks, the reverse checkoff forces teachers to take action to avoid the deduction.</P>
<P>At the time NEA-PAC was established, unions were prohibited from using the reverse checkoff procedure. The NEA, however, claimed that it was a &#147;professional&#148; organization, not a union, and was therefore free from the restrictions placed on unions with regard to PACs. However, on July 20, 1978, the Federal Elections Commission brought suit against the NEA, NEA-PAC, and eighteen of NEA&#146;s affiliates to enjoin them from collecting political contributions by means of a reverse checkoff. For PAC purposes at least, the NEA was held to be a union, and as such, not eligible to utilize the reverse checkoff. The court set April 1, 1979, as the deadline for obtaining each member&#146;s written consent to the contributions they had made through the reverse checkoff. NEA was also to return the deductions to individuals who did not submit the affirmation.</P>
<P>In his oral argument before the U.S. District Court NEA General Counsel Robert H. Chanin asserted:</P>
<P><I>.</I><I> </I><I>.</I><I> </I><I>.</I><I> </I><I>[I]t is well recognized that if you take away the mechanism of payroll deduction you won&#146;t collect </I><I>a penny from these people, and it has nothing to do with voluntary or involuntary. I think it has to do </I><I>with the nature of the beast, and the beasts who are our teachers who are dispersed all over cities </I><I>who simply don&#146;t come up with money regardless of the purpose. Transcript at 19-20.</I></P>
<P>Federal district judge Oliver Gasch commented on Chanin&#146;s startling assertion (because of its candor) as follows:</P>
<P><I>This additional element thus appears to be a curtain of indifference that envel-ops the NEA&#146;s members </I><I>when finances are involved. With respect to their dues, defendants raise this curtain through payroll </I><I>deduction. While it is still up, they add to the deduction the additional dollar for their political action </I><I>fund. Then through reverse check-off, they lower the curtain back around its members to cause that </I><I>indifference to insulate the union from requested refunds. The Supreme Court said in </I><I>Pipefitters</I><I> that </I><I>the essence of whether a contribution is actually or effectively required for union membership in </I><I>violation of the state &#147;is whether the method of solicitation for the fund was calculated to result in </I><I>knowing free-choice donations.&#148; 407 U.S. at 439, 92 S.Ct. at 2276. In this Court&#146;s view, &#147;knowing </I><I>free-choice&#148; means an act intentionally taken and not the result of inaction when confronted with an </I><I>obstacle (</I><I>Federal Election Commission v. National Education Association</I><I>, 1978).</I></P>
<P>Despite its setback on the reverse checkoff, NEA-PAC has been extremely successful in raising campaign funds for its endorsed candidates. NEA has persuaded many members to contribute to NEA-PAC by: 1) signing an authorization for withdrawal (payroll deduction) for monthly contribution, 2) authorizing a lump sum contribution, and 3) contributing funds during special NEA-PAC fund raising activities. These procedures bring in millions of dollars annually to the NEA-PAC account. For instance in 1992, NEA-PAC received almost $2.3 million from state and local affiliates.</P>
<P>To help raise funds for federal campaigns, NEA-PAC sponsors fundraising activities at NEA conventions; at the 1993 convention, these activities generated $500,000. Characterized by NEA publications as &#147;Education&#146;s Defense Fund,&#148; NEA-PAC has compiled one of the most impressive fundraising and win/loss records of any major organization in American politics. Since its formation in 1972, almost 80% of federal candidates endorsed and supported by NEA-PAC have subsequently been elected to national office. NEA-PAC funds are raised by person to person appeals (NEA brochures suggest organizing the appeal around payday for maximum contributions), direct mail appeals, telephone solicitation, special events such as bikeathons, fundraising dinners or dances and giveaways (raffles) and auctions. The NEA Strategic Plan and Budget for Fiscal Year 1993-94, approved by the Representative Assembly, included $268,767 allocated to accounting services for NEA-PAC and state affiliate PAC accounting services. These services to state PACs are provided by NEA&#146;s Government Relations department and funded from members&#146; dues. By having the NEA pay for the expenses of PAC fundraisers, NEA-PAC ends up with more cash for its candidates for federal office. This practice is explicitly recommended in <I>How to Set Up a PAC,</I> one in a series of booklets published by NEA-PAC. The booklet, which outlines step by step procedures to support NEA-PAC, or start a state or local PAC, suggests that &#147;for maximum political effectiveness, use PAC funds solely for making contributions to candidates. Pay PAC administrative costs from the association budget, if possible, but check the state laws first&#148; (NEA, 1985).</P>
<P>Based on FEC reports, a total of 104,552,736 citizens voted in the 1992 presidential general election. These voters represented 55.9 percent of the estimated 187 million Americans who were 18 years or older as of July 1, 1991. The low voter turnout has been duly noticed by the teacher union PACs, which emphasize the need to get out the vote.</P>
<P>PAC contributions to candidates for political office are euphemistically said to &#147;gain access to politicians and the political process,&#148; as opposed to buying votes by special interest groups. Accordingly, in 1992 NEA gained access to Democrat presidential candidate Bill Clinton, 375 Democratic House and Senate candidates, 32 Republican House and Senate candidates, and two candidates in third parties. In 1991-92 NEA-PAC raised $4,427,266, ranking among the top ten PAC fund raisers in the nation for that year.</P>
<P>In 1992, for the first time since 1977, many of the over 4,000 registered PACs, including NEA-PAC drew on surplus funds generated from previous years&#146; activities to spend more than they raised. Using unspent funds remaining from the previous year, NEA-PAC contributions of $5,817,975 made it the third highest PAC spender in 1992, behind the American Medical Association PAC and the Democratic/Republican/and/ Independent Voter Education Committee, also known as the Teamsters PAC. Of NEA-PAC&#146;s total, $2,323,122 in cash was given to federal candidates, while $3,494,853 was spent on campaign activities, such as those described in Chapter 5.</P>
<P><I>NEA-PAC Endorsement Procedures</I>. In addition to establishing its legislative objectives, the NEA naturally tries to elect lawmakers who will support these objectives. The NEA&#146;s endorsement procedures play a crucial role in this process. For Congressional candidates, these procedures are spelled out in the NEA-PAC Endorsement Kit, which goes to every interview team and included the following documents in 1994:</P>
<P>11. <I>NEA&#146;s &#147;How To Endorse Candidates&#148; Training Book and Guide</I>. This book is used to train members of the interview teams. Affiliate guidelines determine how interview team members are selected and the number of NEA members on the team. Team members may include NEA UniServ staff, some of whom are employed specifically to organize political operations for the affiliate. The training program covers both the substantive policy issues and the techniques to be utilized by the interview teams.</P>
<P>12. <I>Candidate Questionnaires</I>. Each candidate receives the questionnaire with a suggested cover letter. The NEA interview team that evaluates the candidates is supposed to have at least one week to review the responses to the questionnaires before the candidates are interviewed. This schedule enables the interview team to prepare its questions for the interviews. Candidates were asked to agree or disagree with 25 NEA position statements and to identify and rank the candidate&#146;s top five priorities for the nation.</P>
<P>13.<I> </I><I>1994 Addendum to the Congressional Candidate Questionnaire</I>. For those House incumbents with an 80 percent or better record of support for NEA-identified issues during the 103rd Congress, positions on previously stated positions were verified and only two questions were asked on this questionnaire:</P>
<P>  &#147;NEA supports the goal of a national, tax-supported, single-payer health care system for all residents of the U.S., its territories, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. NEA will support health care reform measures that move closer to this goal and that will bring about universal coverage, quality assurance, significant cost reduction, and address the needs of children and education employees.&#148;  </P>
<P>  &#147;NEA opposes the taxation of Social Security benefits.&#148;</P>
<P>   For each question, the House incumbent can either agree with NEA&#146;s position (to support legislation which reflects NEA&#146;s position), or disagree with NEA&#146;s position (oppose legislation which reflects NEA&#146;s position). From the Report Card, 217 House incumbents received an NEA rating of 80 percent or higher.</P>
<P>14. <I>NEA Legislative Report Card</I>. The &#147;Report Card&#148; shows how the candidate voted on issues of importance to the NEA. Interview teams are cautioned against accepting candidate statements of support for NEA positions without checking their actual voting records.</P>
<P>15. <I>NEA Legislative Program for the 103rd Congress</I>. Copies of the legislative program are utilized to train members of the interview team as well as to elicit the positions of the candidates. Interview teams are urged to follow a consistent practice in interviewing candidates.</P>
<P>16.<I> </I><I>Background on NEA Issues</I>. This document sets forth the NEA ra-tionale for its legislative proposals. The rationale for the NEA position includes its emphasis on federal guarantees of basic rights&#151;for meaningful collective bargaining, for substantial federal funds, for a single-payer health care system built on the foundation of social in-surance established in such programs as Medicare and Social Security.</P>
<P>17. <I>Interview Team Worksheet.</I> These worksheets are used to facilitate orderly comprehensive candidate interview. The actual questioning of the candidates is done by the interview team chair.</P>
<P>18. <I>Incumbent Profile</I>. The profile includes whatever information about the candidate that may be available from a variety of sources: Correspondence to or from the candidate, reports of NEA lobbyists and Congressional Contact Teams, assessments of election prospects, and so on.</P>
<P>19. <I>Election District Profile</I>. This profile provides demographic and economic data about the election district.</P>
<P>10.<I> </I><I>Tally Sheet</I>. The tally sheet summarizes the information from the Candidate Questionnaire and the interview. It must be completed and returned with the Endorsement Recommendation Form for recommended candidates, and is used later for lobbying as well as for endorsement purposes.</P>
<P>11. <I>NEA-PAC Endorsement Recommendation Form</I>. The recommendation form is generally signed by the president of the affiliate who verifies compliance with the endorsement procedure, after which NEA-PAC determines its endorsement and support.</P>
<P>The 1994 NEA-PAC endorsement kit for Congressional candidates included a list of high-priority legislative issues and the NEA&#146;s position on each. The ratings of candidates who had voted on these issues were shown. Generally, a score of 80 percent was the minimum acceptable for endorsement. &#147;Friendly incumbents&#148; are candidates who supported the NEA position on 80 percent or more of the votes.</P>
<P>Appendix D in this volume consists of worksheets recommended by 
<BR>NEA-PAC for interview team members. Clearly, the entire interview and endorsement process reflects a highly sophisticated approach to achieving political influence; when combined with the enormous resources available to the NEA, the process poses difficult problems for candidates who do 
<BR>not espouse most NEA positions.</P>
<P>NEA-PAC&#146;s political orientation may fairly be characterized as reflective of the left wing of the Democratic Party. Significantly, NEA-PAC can and does contribute to other PACs that share this orientation. This is evident from the following NEA-PAC contributions to other PACS in 1991-92:</P>

<B> Party caucuses in the NEA</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>Despite its overwhelming support for Democratic candidates, there is a Republican Educators Caucus (REC) in the NEA. In 1994, the REC enrolled about 500 members who paid $10 each in caucus dues. The caucus meets only at the NEA convention. Out of approximately 9,000 delegates to the NEA conventions, about 20 have attended recent meetings of the REC. In view of the fact that membership is open to any Republican who is an NEA member, and about 35 percent of NEA members identify themselves as Republicans, active caucus membership is not very impressive.</P>
<P>The REC constitution lists support for Republican candidates, both within the NEA and for public office generally, as a caucus objective, but there is no explicit statement that promoting the Republican agenda in the NEA is such an objective. Interestingly enough, the REC statement of objectives implicitly assumes that the Republicans will be a minority within the NEA; the statement calls for &#147;equal and fair Republican representation&#148; on all association governance bodies.</P>
<P>Although one member of NEA&#146;s Executive Committee, Kathy Bell of Florida, was a member of the caucus in 1994, the REC is essentially a paper organization, with little if any influence in either the NEA or the Republican Party. It is fair to say the REC is much more useful to the NEA than to the Republican Party. By providing minimal if not token representation to Republicans, the NEA is able to claim that its political activities are &#147;bipartisan.&#148; In view of the NEA&#146;s overwhelming support for Democratic candidates, the claim is grossly misleading. For all practical purposes, the leadership of the REC is identical to that of the Teacher Advisory Council (TAC), an official affiliate of the Republican National Committee (RNC). The REC chairperson in 1994 is Laura Fortune of Virginia, who also chairs the RNC&#146;s Teacher Advisory Council. When the TAC held a national meeting on January 8, 1994, the meeting was held at the NEA building. The NEA paid for the air travel of attendees, and NEA affiliates paid for their hotel accommodations. The RNC paid the NEA for use of the meeting space and paid for the lunch. The only action taken at the meeting was a vote to reiterate opposition to vouchers, a vote taken without advance notice that the issue would be on the agenda. An NEA official who has been intimately involved with NEA-PAC since its inception in 1972 could not identify a single instance in which a candidate who supported NEA positions on education was denied support on non-educational grounds. Furthermore, TAC/REC members did not object to or raise any questions about the NEA&#146;s overwhelming preponderance of Democratic endorsements. Everything considered, the REC is not a significant Republican effort to influence the NEA; it is primarily an NEA effort to influence the Republican Party. Of course, the caucus could and perhaps should serve both functions to some extent, but the NEA effort to influence the Republican party clearly overshadows caucus efforts to influence the union.</P>
<P>The NEA has a Democratic as well as a Republican caucus. The main purpose of the Democratic Caucus is to persuade Democratic legislators to support teacher union positions. Surprisingly, the Democratic Caucus was founded partly in response to the formation of the Republican Educators Caucus in the NEA. Although it appears that the leaders of the Democratic Caucus are more active in party affairs than their Republican counterparts, there is no teacher unit in the Democratic National Committee comparable to the Teacher Advisory Council in the Republican National Committee, perhaps because the NEA overwhelmingly supports Democratic candidates regardless. Whereas the Republican Educators Caucus is impotent, the Democratic Caucus is redundant.</P>

<B> AFT legislative program</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>Despite a much simpler structure for developing its legislative program, the AFT supports essentially the same legislative objectives as the NEA. Some differences result from the fact that the AFT is more sensitive to issues of concern to the AFL-CIO. Even this difference is narrowing, however, as the public sector unions play a more prominent role in the AFL-CIO and as the NEA moves toward closer cooperation with it. Occasionally delegates to either the AFT or NEA convention propose legislation for internal political reasons, hence differences in proposed legislation can result from a variety of idiosyncratic factors. Realistically both unions commit their resources to the same legislative objectives, such as defeating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).</P>
<P><I>AFT Rates Congress</I> is an AFT legislative report to its members, prepared by its Department of Legislation. Education, health care and other social service programs have dominated the AFT agenda. Opposition to vouchers, to direct aid to private schools,and to privatization of public servicesare all prominent agenda items. As the AFT characterized the matter, most of its efforts were directed against presidential vetoes and attacks on critical programs rather than advancing AFT initiatives during the Bush adminisration.</P>
<P><I>Whether the issue was preventing the permanent replacement of striking workers, stopping American </I><I>companies from taking jobs to Mexico, redirecting savings in the defense budget to short-changed </I><I>domestic programs or funding education, health care and public services, the AFT and organized labor </I><I>consistently faced a battle in Congress and a like veto from the White House (</I><I>AFT Rates Congress</I><I>, </I><I>1992).</I></P>
<P>In 1992 the AFT took credit for federal legislation which permitted payment of off-season unemployment benefits to paraprofessionals and school-related personnel. The AFT was also active in the successful effort to extend the tax-free status of several union-negotiated employee benefits programs, including group legal services, employer-paid education, and tax-sheltered annuities. Mandatory HIV testing of health care workers was defeated, in part because of AFT opposition. Campaign finance reform was a major topic in the 102nd Congress (1990-92) during which time AFT vigorously opposed a measure which would have reduced PAC contributions from $5,000 to $1,000 and which would have required that the majority of individual campaign contributions come from within the congressional district. AFT supports public financing of electionsandsupports the retention of PACs and PAC contributions.</P>
<P>Despite its opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the AFT was highly supportive of the Clinton administration&#146;s legislative program, especially its health care proposals. The AFT secretary-treasurer met regularly in 1993 with the administration&#146;s health care policy adviser to advocate the AFT&#146;s position on the issue. Because health care benefits were coming under severe fiscal pressures at teacher bargaining tables, the AFT formed the AFT Health Care Reform Committee to analyze reform proposals and to make recommendations for the benefit of its members. As did the NEA, the AFT downplayed the fact that the Clinton administration&#146;s health care plan would enable school employers to pay higher salaries if the federal government absorbed a larger share of the costs of health care.</P>

<B> AFT committee on political education (COPE)</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>To support the AFT legislative programs through lobbying and direct contributions to candidates, AFT members are encouraged to support the AFT&#146;s Committee on Political Education, widely referred to as AFT/COPE. COPE is the AFT political action committee operating at local, state and national levels of government. Like NEA-PAC, AFT/COPE is overwhelmingly supportive of Democratic candidates for federal office. Obviously, AFT/COPE does not support candidates opposed by the AFL-CIO, so we can expect AFT/COPE to be at least as supportive of Democrats as the AFL-CIO. Inasmuch as the AFL-CIO is relatively weak in some states where the state associations affiliated with the NEA are a major interest group, NEA-PAC is more likely than AFT/COPE to support a few Republican candidates for federal office. In 1989-90, AFT/COPE was the 9th largest contributor of &#147;soft money,&#148; that is, funds that are contributed to party organizations, usually for activities not related to a specific candidacy. The entire AFT/COPE contribution of $170,000 went to Democratic party organizations. In that same year, NEA-PAC contributed $285,000 to Democratic, $5,000 to Republican party organizations. Despite the AFT&#146;s much smaller membership, AFT/COPE raises significant amounts; for example, in 1991-92, NEA-PAC contributed $2.3 million, and AFT/COPE $1.1 million to candidates for federal office. Significantly, their combined contributions were considerably higher than the contributions of any other political action committee.</P>
<P>Unlike NEA-PAC however, COPE contributors must be informed that their COPE chapter is engaged in joint fundraising efforts with the AFL-CIO and that the money contributed to COPE will be used in connection with federal, state and local elections.</P>
<P>Not surprisingly, one of President Clinton&#146;s first campaign appearances after receiving the Democratic nomination for president was at the 1992 AFT Convention. At the convention, delegates received AFT/COPE packets which included Clinton and Gore fact sheets, camera-ready letters for local leaders to send to members, phone bank scripts and other campaign materials. Subsequently, AFT staff were assigned to campaign activities in Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Missouri, Louisiana, Connecticut, Oregon and Minnesota. The AFT/COPE director has estimated that 75 percent of the AFT membership supported Clinton. AFT activists volunteered for phone banks, organized get out the vote efforts, held rallies, distributed literature, displayed yard signs, campaigned door to door and voted.</P>

<B> The political role of teacher unions at the local level</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>In seeking bargaining rights, the teacher unions argued that &#129;93&quot;equity&#148; required it. Private sector workers had the right to bargain collectively whereas teachers did not. The fact that teachers could play an important role in the election of the public officials who constitute management was simply dismissed. As AFT president Albert Shanker asserted, &#147;If teachers control both sides of the bargaining table in a substantial number of school districts, we should find many teachers with huge salaries, greatly reduced class sizes, longer holidays and vacations than ever before&#151;you name it&#148; (Shanker, 1979). According to Shanker, since there do not appear to be such districts, objections to teacher bargaining based on the teacher role in electing management must be fallacious. Such is the union rebuttal to the argument that their opportunity to affect the election of school board members justifies some restrictions on their bargaining rights.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most appropriate commentary on the issue is to be found in the literature disseminated by the teacher unions. An AFT brochure published in 1993 for school related personnel describes in glowing terms how AFT locals managed to elect supportive school boards in various school districts. For all practical purposes, there is no counterpart to this situation in the private sector. It should be emphasized that the teacher union presence in local school board elections does not imply that the teacher unions have unfettered power over both sides of the bargaining table. It means that they have enough influence on the managerial side to achieve concessions at the expense of citizens and groups which do not bargain collectively with school boards.</P>
<P>There are approximately 15,000 local school districts in the United States. Understandably, no one knows the extent of union influence in each and every district. On the face of it, however, it would be irrational for the teacher unions to create an effective political capability and then store it in mothballs during local school board elections. In practice, the same resources, practices and techniques that are employed in federal and state elections are brought to bear on school board elections. For example, candidates for school board are frequently asked to complete a questionnaire which is then scored by the local union. Quite often, the questions are taken from questionnaires prepared by the state association for state office.</P>
<P>Union influence at the local level is extremely variable. Where school board elections are held separately from general elections, voter turnout is usually very low, perhaps two to three percent of the turnout at general elections. Teacher union support is frequently the key to victory as voter turnout declines. This point was dramatically illustrated by the teacher union campaign to defeat Proposition 174, the California voucher initiative. The California Teachers Association successfully opposed the effort to have the initiative on the ballot in a general election, and then was by far the most influential interest group active in the special state election on 
<BR>the initiative. Coincidentally, it was easy for CTA telephone banks established to defeat proposition 174 to support union endorsed candidates in the school board elections held concurrently with the state ballot on Proposition 174.</P>
<P>In some metropolitan areas, teachers in suburban districts or outlying areas live in the central cities. Although teacher union influence does not necessarily depend on teachers being voters in the districts where they teach, some large districts have an unusually large teacher constituency while neighboring districts may have practically none. At all levels of government, however, the immense NEA/AFT political capability underscores a paradoxical fact. Unquestionably, the growing political power of teacher unions has been due to teacher bargaining, especially on organizational security clauses that maximize union revenues and contributions to union controlled political funds. The paradox is that teacher bargaining was initially justified on the grounds that political and legislative procedures were inadequate to resolve terms and conditions of teacher employment. In the pre-bargaining era, teachers often had to enact state legislation to achieve benefits; since the benefits could often have been achieved at the local level with strong local organizations, the need for a stronger local presence was understandable. The upshot, however, was that the legislative framework intended to strengthen teacher influence at the local level turned out to be the basis for their unprecedented political power. It would be difficult to think of a more unexpected turn of events in either education or politics.</P>

<B> State and local teacher union PACs</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>State and local political affiliates of the NEA have established political action committees that support state and local candidates and issues. In addition, state and local PACs collect most of the funds which are subsequently submitted to NEA-PAC.</P>
<P>Federal restrictions on PAC funds do not apply to elections for state and local office or ballot measures. The latter are governed by state statutes that vary widely. One important difference is that the &#147;reverse checkoff&#148; is prohibited by federal, but is permitted by some state statutes. In any event, each state must comply with the federal campaign finance laws applicable to candidates for federal offices. Federal law specifies that (1) money contributed to federal candidates must be collected separately from dues; (2) voluntary contributions must be kept in a separate account; and 
<BR>(3) members must not be coerced into contributing to the PAC fund. Nevertheless, unions that collect funds for national PACs can contribute to candidates for state and local offices. In addition, the unions can use general funds, or dues revenue to pay political staff, to publish articles or to purchase materials used to collect PAC funds. Unions can also legally employ political directors who direct political campaigns and coordinate fundraising and are paid from dues revenues. Such revenues can also be used to print and distribute literature asking for PAC contributions, although agency fee payors must not be charged for this.</P>
<P>Although comprehensive data on the income and expenditures of the state association PACs are not available, the following examples are probably representative of the others.</P>
<P><I>Colorado</I>&#151;NEA-PAC and two PACs associated with NEA affiliates in Colorado were among the largest political action committees active in the 1992 elections in Colorado. CEA Ed-PAC, the state PAC of the Colorado Education Association, was the leading contributor at $533,957. Of that, $180,000 was spent to defeat the school voucher issue, $18,300 was given to the Colorado Democratic State Central Committee (none to the Republican party), $65,000 to the Colorado Democratic Coordinated Campaign and 47 contributions ranging from $100 to $2,000, went to individual state candidates.</P>
<P>The NEA (not NEA-PAC) was the third largest cash contributor to Colorado political contests in 1992, with contributions of $100,000 or more to No on Vouchers, the Colorado Democratic State Central Committee, and the Colorado Education Association.</P>
<P>The Jefferson County Education Association, an affiliate of CEA/NEA was the fifteenth largest contributor in Colorado, spending over $78,000 for various candidates, the Democratic party agencies and the NEA and state affiliates. In contrast, supporters of the 1992 Colorado voucher initiative contributed at most only $106,000 to the voucher campaign.</P>
<P><I>Wisconsin</I>&#151;WEAC-PAC, the Wisconsin Education Association political action committee, received $578,309, primarily from member contributions just for the 1992 primary election. Disbursements of $441,061 were spent for voter/survey research, television production, lease-back for phone banks, wages for phone bank operators, endorsement/member communications, travel and lodging expenses, literature drop, and other expenses associated with political campaigns. In addition, pre-election WEAC-PAC independent disbursements for staff time, television production and advertisements were estimated to be over $38,000.</P>
<P>The political assistance provided by state teacher union PACs is often underestimated in several ways. First, it is easy to overlook their importance in the entire election cycle, including contested primaries. Teacher union support may persuade some candidates not to run, thereby enabling the union endorsed candidate an uncontested path to the nomination. The availability of teacher union support may render its utilization unnecessary in the early stages of an election cycle.</P>
<P>Beyond any doubt, the noncash contributions of teacher unions are vastly underestimated, even in states where they are legally required to be reported. First, states vary in what they require to be reported. Second, it is practically impossible to monitor some categories that are required to be reported such as telephone time, meals and mileage, folding envelopes, postage used, whatever; it is virtually certain that all such contributions will be under-reported. Furthermore, the contributors are often the ones who place the valuation on the contribution and they have a strong political interest in minimizing it. Some interesting data on the opposition to Proposition 174 suggests the importance of the source as well as the amount of PAC contributions. Citizens Against 174, a coalition PAC opposing the initiative, received over $10 million in cash and $6.9 million in noncash contributions. Only 16 individuals contributed $100 or more to it; five labor unions provided 95 percent of the contributions. The total union contributions were about $15.7 million, or 92.7 percent of the total contributions. Cash contributions from unions usually are accompanied by many more contributions in-kind than are cash contributions from individuals. This point is emphasized in the following chapter.</P>

<B> The implications of union political convergence</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The fact that the NEA and AFT (including their PACs) agree overwhelmingly on which candidates to support raises some interesting questions about their endorsement procedures. For example, the NEA emphasizes the fact that its legislative program is the result of an extensive effort to elicit member views on legislative issues and candidates. The AFT seems to arrive at the same positions on candidates and issues, albeit as the result of a different and less extensive process. Whatever the differences in positions ultimately adopted, they do not appear to be based on any significant difference in political philosophy or union structure. Whether teachers are members of the NEA or AFT, their unions overwhelmingly support the same candidates and positions. Similarly, the widespread perception that the AFT is more reform oriented than the NEA can be attributed more to AFT President Albert Shanker&#146;s media skills than to any significant differences 
<BR>between the NEA and AFT on educational issues.</P>
<P>The convergence of NEA and AFT positions on a wide spectrum of candidates and issues suggests that the importance of some organizational differences is greatly exaggerated. Second, the convergence highlights the importance of leadership control of union communications. In the 1970s, NEA leadership was opposed to merger, hence NEA publications and conferences were directed at stirring up rank and file opposition to it. Just as clearly, NEA leadership in 1994 is striving to produce a favorable climate of opinion concerning merger. Our point is not to support or oppose any position on merger; it is to emphasize that governance procedures that are formally democratic may nevertheless be dominated politically by incumbent union leadership. What teachers want their unions to support does not emerge out of a vacuum; more often than not, union leaders who control union communications have played a major role in shaping the teacher objectives.</P>

<B> The 1993 California Voucher Initiative (Proposition 174)</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>In recent years, legislation providing financial assistance to parents who wish to enroll their children in private schools has been introduced in several state legislatures and ballot initiatives. Chiefly because of teacher union opposition, such legislation has never been enacted in a statewide election. The most striking example of this opposition was the defeat of Proposition 174, a California voucher initiative that lost on November 2, 1993 by 1,451,322 (30.3%) (Yes) to 3,334,678 (69.7%) (No). Under the initiative proposal, parents would have been entitled to a voucher worth $2,600 (about half of the $5,200 that the state supposedly spends annually per elementary and secondary pupil) to enroll a child in any public or private school of their choosing, including parochial schools. In view of the fact that a majority of voters appeared to support school choice at the outset of the campaign, the overwhelming defeat of the initiative obviously suggests an aggressive well financed campaign to defeat it. As we shall see, this inference understates the CTA&#146;s successful efforts in this regard.</P>
<P>About 15 percent of all school children in the United States live in California. Of California&#146;s nearly six million students, 550,000 of them were enrolled in some 3,839 private and religious schools where the average tuition charged was about $7,000 per year; however, a large number of California private schools, especially Catholic schools, charged much less for tuition (<I>New York Times,</I> 1993). Both proponents and opponents of Proposition 174 agreed that its enactment could set off a chain reaction of school choice laws across the nation. Understandably, the initiative ignited what may have been the most intensive campaign over a state educational initiative in U.S. history.</P>
<P>Proponents of Proposition 174 contended that its enactment would eventually result in huge savings in state expenditures for education while simultaneously raising achievement levels. Meanwhile, the CTA contended that enactment of Proposition 174 would result in large tax increases because 
<BR>(1) there would be large new expenditures for pupils already enrolled in private schools; and (2) private schools did not have the capacity to absorb enough transfers from the public schools to offset the additional expenditures for pupils already enrolled in private schools. The CTA emphasized this argument very effectively with tax conscious voters, especially retirees concerned about tax increases. The union also argued that 174 was &#147;a risk that we can&#146;t afford,&#148; since it included no provisions prohibiting extremist groups from establishing taxpayer funded private schools (<I>CTA, Election </I><I>News</I>, 1993).</P>
<P>Proposition 174 raised a host of such issues that are outside the scope of this book. Obviously, the teacher unions were adamantly opposed to it, but our concern here is not with the merits or demerits of their position, but with their efforts to defeat it. To convey some idea of the massive resources that the teacher unions can utilize for political purposes, let us look briefly at how they reacted to Proposition 174.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>The NEA Role</FONT></A></H5>
<P>The NEA&#146;s opposition to parental choice plans such as Proposition 174 is spelled out in its official resolution on the issue:</P>
<P><I>A-28. Federally or State-Mandated Choice/Parental Option Plans</I><I> </I><I> </I></P>
<P><I>The National Education Association believes that federally or state mandated parental option or choice </I><I>plans compromise the Association&#146;s commitment to free, equitable, universal, and quality public </I><I>education for every student. Therefore, the Association opposes such federally or state-mandated </I><I>choice or parental option plans.</I></P>
<P><I> </I><I> </I><I>The Association believes that local districts, in partnership with state and federal governments, must </I><I>provide a quality education for every student by securing sufficient funding to maintain and to enhance </I><I>excellence in each local public school district.</I></P>
<P><I> </I><I> </I><I>The Association continues to support alternative programs in the public schools for specific purposes </I><I>(</I><I>NEA Today</I><I>, 1993).</I></P>
<P>Calling the defeat of Proposition 174 its top political priority, the NEA contributed $1 million in cash to assist the CTA defeat Proposition 174. Its cash contribution was supplemented by a wide variety of supportive activities. Referring specifically to Proposition 174, NEA President Keith Geiger publicly called for the members to &#147;repel this assault&#151;just as we did in Colorado. This November, we must not&#151;we will not&#151;permit our nation&#146;s most populous state to be ruled by the ideology we repudiated last November when we elected President Clinton&#148; (<I>NEA Today</I>, 1993). In accordance with these sentiments, NEA publications launched a heavy barrage of criticisms of Proposition 174 over several months prior to the election. For example, <I>NEA Today</I>, the NEA&#146;s monthly publication sent to members, repeatedly warned NEA members of the dire consequences that would follow passage of Proposition 174. <I>NEA NOW,</I> a weekly newsletter disseminated to NEA leaders nationwide, featured &#147;The Voucher Battle&#148; and set forth the NEA&#146;s intention to &#147;mobilize every friend of public education in the state by election day&#151;and deliver the drive to privatize public education a blow that will end voucher as a live threat to improving public education&#148; (<I>NEA NOW,</I> 1993).</P>
<P>Nationwide attacks on Proposition 174 were crucial to NEA&#146;s efforts to enlist support from union members outside of California to defeat the perceived threat to public education. The importance of defeating Proposition 174 was effectively disseminated throughout the United States through no fewer than ten national publications targeted to students, active members, retired members and opinion leaders. Chapters 6 and 7 take up in more detail NEA-PAC, the NEA&#146;s political action committee. Officially at least, NEA-PAC contributes only to candidates for federal office and was not directly involved in the campaign to defeat Proposition 174.</P>
<H5><A ID="I15" NAME="I15">
<FONT SIZE=4>The Role of the California Teachers Association (CTA)</FONT></A></H5>
<P>Indisputably, the CTA, the state affiliate of the NEA, was the major source of opposition to Proposition 174. For starters, the CTA assessed its 225,783 members $57 each as part of a plan to raise and spend from $12-15 million to defeat Proposition 174 (<I>New York Times,</I> 1993). Although some membership categories were not required to pay the full assessment, it appears that over 200,000 CTA members were subject to it. The assessment was in addition to CTA/NEA dues ($475 per year in 1993-94), some of which was spent on various staff activities devoted to defeating Proposition 174.</P>
<P><I>CTA Political Action Committees</I>. In addition to national political action committees, state PACs exist to collect and spend funds on state ballot issues and candidates for state offices. Regulations governing contributors, contribution limits, reporting requirements, and disclosure are enacted and implemented on a state by state basis.</P>
<P>Several state political action committees opposed Proposition 174: Citizens Against 174, CTA Issues PAC, CTA/Association for Better Citizenship PAC and the Committee to Protect the Political Rights of Minorities, headed by a CTA associate executive director. In 1993 there were no dollar limit restrictions on contributions to California PACs. Individuals, businesses, corporations, organizations, political parties or other PACs could legally contribute to state PACs in California, hence the CTA PACs were virtually unrestricted in their ability to accept contributions. As of November 2, 1993, the CTA PACs had raised $18,000,000. In contrast, the proponents of Proposition 174 had established only one PAC, Yes on 174, A Better Choice, which had raised only $2.7 million by election day.</P>
<P><I>CTA Advertising.</I> Most CTA funds were funnelled through the PACs established to defeat Proposition 174 and thereafter spent on advertising. By mid-summer, with the election months away, the CTA had spent $1.9 million for a six-week series of radio and TV advertisements telling Californians that Proposition 174 would result in higher taxes while gambling with children&#146;s futures. By late September the CTA had spent another $4.7 million for radio and television advertising, whereas the Yes on 174 campaign had not even begun advertising as of October 1. By mid October &#147;No&#148; spots aired six to ten times as often as the &#147;Yes&#148; spots (<I>No on Vouchers</I>, 1993).</P>
<P>The CTA also funded weeks of paid newspaper advertisements. In addition, press releases, news items, editorial commentaries, and letters to the editors of California daily and weekly newspapers were disseminated frequently. During the summer, the CTA scored a media coup with a story about a coven of witches who would supposedly establish their own voucher-redeeming school if Proposition 174 were enacted. It is somewhat surprising that the proponents of Proposition 174 did not raise the question of what schools these witches had attended.</P>
<P>In addition, a variety of CTA publications sent to members, such as <I>No on Vouchers, Chalk Talk,</I> <I>Election News</I> and <I>Liaison News </I>(the CTA weekly newsletter), included updates about the union&#146;s activities and membership responsibilities relating to Proposition 174. Meanwhile, the CTA&#146;s Government Relations Division distributed one-page flyers opposed to Proposition 174 in at least seven languages. And if readers were literate in languages other than Armenian, Chinese, English, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog (&#147;Filipino&#148;), or Vietnamese, the CTA was prepared to draft and disseminate flyers in other languages as well. In addition, the CTA&#146;s Ethnic Minority Affairs Committee successfully arranged denunciations of Proposition 174 as &#147;racist&#148; by prominent elected black leaders, and actively solicited statements of opposition from other ethnic leaders in the Hispanic and Asian communities, among others.</P>
<P><I>CTA Consultants.</I> Professional advisors (consultants) were hired by the CTA to develop strategies, create images, and deliver a targeted message to key voter groups. Polling data indicated where the money should be spent and which attacks would produce the desired results. Tactical trends made it possible to respond rapidly to attacks while using the most effective appeals to undecided voters. Since most voters make up their minds in the 10 days before an election, final media messages, direct mail appeals, and get out the vote efforts were carefully crafted for maximum results.</P>
<P>It should be emphasized that the CTA resources devoted to the actual election on November 2, 1993 were not all of the CTA resources devoted to defeating Proposition 174. As early as 1991, the CTA had contributed $430,000 in an effort to keep the voucher initiative off the ballot. Proposition 174 was originally scheduled to appear on the June 1994 California primary ballot with the following title: &#147;Education. Scholarships. Parental Choice.&#148; This had been the proposal&#146;s working title for 18 months, but after CTA attorneys argued that it was inappropriate, the state attorney general and secretary of state accepted the CTA&#146;s recommended title: 
<BR>&#147;Education. Vouchers. Initiative Constitutional Amendment.&#148; In a post-election assessment, pollsters for Proposition 174 stated that the change in the title resulted in a 10 percent drop in support for Proposition 174. Unquestionably, if Proposition 174 had passed, CTA attorneys would have challenged it constitutionally on the grounds that it constituted state support of religion.</P>
<P>CTA efforts to prevent Proposition 174 from being on the ballot were unique in the annals of California politics. As Proposition 174 supporters circulated petitions to get the measure on the ballot, they were often challenged by anti-174 forces employed by the CTA at sites where the petitions were being made available for signatures (Weber, 1992). In fact, the measure first failed to qualify for the November 1992 general election ballot for highly controversial legal reasons. The president of one of the two companies in California that specializes in collecting signatures for initiative petitions submitted a sworn statement to a California court, asserting that he had been offered $400,000 to refrain from gathering signatures for the initiative. The offer was allegedly made by the signature-gathering firm employed by the CTA. In a statement disseminated at the 1992 NEA convention, CTA president D.A. Weber explained the union&#146;s efforts to dissuade voters from signing the petition as follows:</P>
<P><I> </I><I> </I><I>And you and I, the California Teachers Association, decided to do something very dramatic, </I><I>something nobody had ever tried in the nine decades that the initiative has existed in this state. We </I><I>decided to create an organized campaign to block an initiative from getting enough signatures to qualify </I><I>for the ballot.</I></P>
<P><I> </I><I> </I><I>We realized that we would be accused of acting in an &#147;undemocratic&#148; manner. What was wrong, </I><I>after all, with letting the people vote on an issue? </I><I> </I><I> </I><I>Our answer was firm: There are some proposals </I><I>that are so evil that they should never even be presented to the voters. We do not believe, for </I><I>example, that we should hold an election on &#147;empowering&#148; the Ku Klux Klan. And we would not </I><I>think it&#146;s &#147;undemocratic&#148; to oppose voting on legalizing child prostitution.</I></P>
<P><I> </I><I> </I><I>Destroying public education, in our view, belongs in that category (Weber, 1992).</I></P>
<P><I>CTA Voter Registration/Absentee Ballots.</I> Voter registration by mail in California is a process in which a non-registered resident may request an application for registration, complete the form and return it to the election officer at the county auditor&#146;s office, who in turn advises the individual of the voter&#146;s precinct, polling place and confirmed registration.</P>
<P>Voting by mail is a procedure similar to voter registration by mail. In 1992 almost 2 million Californians voted absentee ballots, the highest number recorded since the enactment of a 1978 law allowing absentee voting<I> </I>(<I>Campaign</I>, 1993). In 1993, all CTA members were encouraged to vote by mail against Proposition 174 so they would have extra time on election day to volunteer for other political activities.</P>
<P>Absentee ballots have the potential to change the outcome of an election and are an important aspect of campaign strategy. Prime targets for absentee ballots include senior citizens, disabled persons and out-of-town students. The request for an absentee ballot is a public record; therefore, the CTA assigned individuals, county by county, to monitor the absentee ballot requests. Each voter requesting a ballot then also received a letter and brochure explaining CTA&#146;s opposition to Proposition 174. Dedicated volunteers, such as retired CTA members, as well as paid personnel were utilized in these efforts.</P>
<P>The CTA also conducted extensive, sophisticated voter identification and get out the vote drives. Of the 500 phone banks being operated by the coalition, nearly 100 were in CTA offices. The majority of the phone bank volunteers were CTA members and staff who had called more than 500,000 voters by the end of September (<I>CTA Action,</I> 1993). The week before the election, phone bank operators called 25,000 registered voters each day to determine how the voter intended to vote on election day. Teachers were urged to volunteer for two to six hours work on the phone banks; however, some workers were paid to supplement the volunteers. The CTA phone banks utilized phones and phone lines purchased by the CTA orother unions, ostensibly for union business. This is a common technique to avoid paying the higher rates charged political campaigns. Working from a carefully crafted script which covered all likely responses, the voter&#146;s responses were tallied by phone bank personnel. The valuable information obtained this way was used to identify and activate those voters who supported the CTA position. Starting the night before election day, follow-up calls reminding the voter to vote were made to all voters who had indicated support for the CTA position. If the voter had not yet been to the polls but remained favorable to CTA&#146;s position, a second reminder call would be made if time permitted. In the campaign against Proposition 174, the CTA exceeded its goal of one million telephone calls, directed mainly to voters who had presumably voted Democratic in the past four elections. Obviously, maintaining such lists and preparing effective responses for the campaign against Proposition 174 required substantial funds and political expertise.</P>
<P><I>CTA Report Card.</I> CTA monitors the votes of all California lawmakers, especially those who have received union contributions. The results are set forth in the <I>CTA&#146;s Report Card</I>, a summary that utilizes a point system to grade legislators and candidates. In 1991-92 legislators had until October 15 to respond to the CTA questionnaire, but even non-responding legislators were monitored to determine whether they had endorsed the initiative.</P>
<P>Using computer technology, CTA staff tracked key votes cast by every state senator and assembly member. In scoring the results, the CTA included committee votes and activities on various issues deemed important by the CTA. However even those scores were adjusted to reflect positions taken for or against Proposition 174 (<I>NEA/CTA Making the Grade</I>, 1992). In fact, Tom Campbell, a prominent candidate for the state senate who had supported the initiative, changed his position after the CTA threatened to run one of its officers and mount an all-out campaign against him. After CTA announced that it would &#147;saturate the area&#148; with money and campaign workers (<I>Los Angeles Times</I>, 1993), Campbell, a Stanford University law professor, let it be known that after reading the initiative more carefully, he had decided to oppose it.</P>
<P>The CTA is widely regarded as the most powerful and biggest spending lobby in California. Insofar as cash contributions foster influence, this conclusion is obvious. According to the California Secretary of State, the CTA spent $2,125,472 lobbying in first quarter of 1993, four times the amount spent by the next highest special interest group, the California Medical Association. In 1991-92, the CTA spent over $7.4 million on political campaigns and lobbying. Legislators who support the NEA/CTA positions are typically rewarded with contributions in the next election cycle.</P>
<P>In 1990 CTA-endorsed candidates won in 95 percent of their primary races with the highest winning percentages in state legislative and Congressional candidate races. CTA-endorsed candidates for state senate won 16 of 16 races, and Assembly candidates won 52 of 53. In the 1990 June primary 83 percent of ballot measures endorsed and supported by CTA were approved (<I>CTA Action,</I> 1990).</P>
<P>According to California Common Cause, in the 1989-1990 election cycle, the top ten PACs gave more than $6,000,000 to legislative candidates and causes. CTA PAC was the top contributor, giving more than $1,000,000 to legislative candidates and key ballot measures (<I>American School Board </I>
<BR><I>Journal</I>, 1991). PACs representing trial lawyers, real estate agents, hospitals, labor unions, dentists, optometrists, and restaurant owners were among the other top contributors. Quantifying how much influence the contributions buy is very difficult, but CTA opponents as well as supporters agree that legislation opposed by the CTA is very unlikely to be enacted.</P>
<P><I>CTA In-Kind Contributions.</I> In addition to direct contributions California requires that the fair market value of any goods or services provided to or on behalf of a committee, including a description of the goods and serv-ices provided, be disclosed and filed with the Secretary of State. In-kind contributions and/or non-monetary contributions from CTA included: staff time, consultant time and travel, printing, duplicating, postage, photography, meetings, legal consultations, advertising, buttons, or specific projects, such as the CTA Vote-By-Mail Project. Even so, volunteer CTA staff time, routine advertising and endorsements in CTA publications, union sponsored newspaper columns, CTA phone bank operations, CTA petition solicitations, precinct walking, rallies, and CTA leadership training are only some of the influential campaign activities that are not recorded.</P>
<P><I>CTA Independent Expenditures</I>. According to California Form 420, an &#147;independent expenditure&#148; is an expenditure made in connection with a communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, or the qualification, passage, or defeat of a clearly identified ballot measure, but is not made to, or at the behest of, the affected candidate or any committee primarily formed to support or oppose the candidate or measure. Made &#147;at the behest of&#148; means made under the control of, or at the direction of, in cooperation, consultation or concert with, or at the request or suggestions of the candidate or committee. An expenditure that is made to, or at the behest of, a candidate or committee is a &#147;contribution.&#148;</P>
<P>When independent expenditures exceed $500, the parties responsible for them must file a return disclosing the expenditures. The latter may include or be associated with:</P>
<P>&#149;  The preparation, production and distribution of campaign literature  and printed solicitations, including expenditures for mailing lists,  postage, design, copy and layout, printing and reproduction.</P>
<P>&#149;  The production and purchase of radio and television advertising.</P>
<P>&#149;  The production and purchase of advertising in newspapers, periodicals and other publications.</P>
<P>&#149;  The production and purchase of advertising on billboards or other  campaign signs, and campaign paraphernalia such as buttons, bumper  stickers, potholders, etc.</P>
<P>&#149;  Designing or conducting polls, reports on election trends, voter sur veys, etc., including payment to signature gatherers for qualification  drives, and door-to-door solicitors.</P>
<P>&#149;  The holding of a fundraising event, including payments to restau rants, hotels or halls, caterers and other food and refreshment vendors, entertainers and speakers,</P>
<P>&#149;  And for travel within or out of California.</P>
<P>CTA efforts to defeat Proposition 174 also included independent expend-itures. In addition, press reports alleged that several CTA members had engaged in anti-Proposition 174 independent expenditure activities.</P>
<P><I>CTA Coalitions.</I> Coalition building is usually essential to any successful campaign, hence it is not surprising that the anti-Proposition 174 steering committee included virtually the entire California public education establishment. Seven anti-voucher coalition groups comprised the Executive Steering Committee of the Citizens Against 174 committee. See Table 5.1 for the member groups and the funds contributed by each for the defeat of Proposition 174. Prior to changing its name in late August, the group was known as the Committee to Educate Against Vouchers or CEAV. By far the largest membership organization represented on the steering committee, the California Teachers Association contributed over 80 percent ($12.3 million) of the coalition budget and provided the organizational structure, staff and office space for its efforts. Although each of the other six organizations on the Executive Steering Committee of Citizens Against 174 has its own organizational structure, the CTA messages were evident in the acti-vities of coalition members. Coalitions offered speakers&#146; bureaus, voter registration/information drives, phone banks, and election day precinct walks to help promote the No on 174 campaign.</P>
<P>The preceding discussion has not presented a complete account of the CTA campaign to defeat Proposition 174, and it may not be possible to do so for years to come. It is especially important to recognize that CTA played a critical role in fostering and orchestrating the local teacher union efforts to defeat it. For example, CTA prepared the telephone messages used at the local level to guide teachers who worked on the telephone banks. It prepared the various translations of the &#147;No on 174&#148; flyers distributed at the local level to different ethnic groups by CTA&#146;s local affiliates. Similarly, a host of other campaign activities were carried out by CTA&#146;s local affiliates</P>
<P>with CTA resources under CTA guidance and leadership. Although we lack a comprehensive summary of campaign activities at any level, the preceding comments obviously reveal an impressive political operation that left nothing to chance or to lack of resources.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>American Federation of Teachers (AFT)</FONT></A></H5>
<P>By June 1992, the AFT had contributed $8,500 to defeat Proposition 174 and its state affiliate was also a member of the steering committee of Citizens Against 174. Although AFT efforts to defeat Proposition 174 were similar to NEA&#146;s in many respects, its efforts should not be considered merely additive. AFT President Albert Shanker was an early and per-
<BR>haps the most effective national opponent of vouchers and privatization. For several years, Shanker has criticized such plans in AFT sponsored advertisements in the <I>New York Times.</I> In this forum as well as several others which are open to him, Shanker has disseminated criticisms of school choice to millions of readers and television viewers. He is especially skillful at presenting his criticisms to the academic and policy communities; one can only wonder how or why the Bush administration appointed Shanker to the National Council on Competitiveness, a federally sponsored policy group that is supposed to enhance the nation&#146;s ability to compete economically.</P>
<P>Having referred to Proposition 174 as the likely coup de gr&#226;ce of public education, it is hardly surprising that Shanker was instrumental in arranging AFL-CIO opposition to it. This opposition was expressed in AFL-CIO publications disseminated to millions of AFL-CIO members. In addition, President Clinton and Secretary of Labor Robert Reich announced their opposition to Proposition 174 at the October 1993 meeting of the AFL-CIO Executive Council in San Francisco. Following an earlier appeal by the AFT, the AFL-CIO Executive Council launched an aggressive campaign against Proposition 174, charging that if enacted it would undermine support for public services throughout the nation (<I>American Teacher</I>, 1993).</P>
<H5><A ID="I19" NAME="I19">
<FONT SIZE=4>California Federation of Teachers (CFT)</FONT></A></H5>
<P>The AFT state affiliate, the California Federation of Teachers (CFT), raised $1.1 million from its 40,000 members to defeat Proposition 174. Federation funds were collected and disseminated through its Committee on Political Education (CFT/COPE). In addition, CFT/COPE trained and organized activist opponents county by county to disseminate the CFT message of opposition to Proposition 174 throughout the state. Non-cash contributions also included payment for direct mail, paid and unpaid media, phone banks, coalition building, voter registration drives and get-out-the-vote activities.</P>
<P>In this study we have not tried to track the role of the nonteacher unions in the campaign against Proposition 174. In California, educational support staff have been organized by several unions, including the following:</P>
<P>American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees    (AFSCME) (AFL-CIO)</P>
<P>Service Employees International Union (SEIU) (AFL-CIO)</P>
<P>Teamsters (AFL-CIO)</P>
<P>California School Employees Association (CSEA)</P>
<P>Although these unions were represented on the steering committee of Citizens Against 174, they were not major players in the campaign to defeat it. Undoubtedly one reason was the expectation that the teacher union effort, along with AFL-CIO support, would be sufficient to defeat the 
<BR>initiative. The likelihood is, however, that the members and unions of school related personnel would have been more active politically as members of the NEA or AFT; inasmuch as support personnel are likely to be organized by the NEA or AFT, especially if these unions effectuate a merger, teacher union political influence may increase considerably in the near future.</P>

<B> Alabama: The Hubbert campaign*</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>  *The discussion of the Hubbert campaign is based largly on Alan Ehrenhalt, The United States of Ambition  (New York: Random House, 1991). </P>
<P>Like the CTA, the Alabama Education Association (AEA) is the state&#146;s largest and most powerful special interest group. Like other NEA state affiliates, AEA political activities are designed to influence legislation, elect candidates, and promote or defeat legislation. But in Alabama teachers do more than influence legislation&#151;they propose and vote on it. An Alabama ethics commission reported that by 1987, 58 of 140 members of the state legislature were teachers, former teachers, or spouses of teachers. AEA Executive Director Paul R. Hubbert is the dominant power in the state legislature on educational issues, and is credited with creating a powerful alliance that includes teachers, blacks and unions. As early as the 1960s, when Hubbert had been a classroom teacher in rural north Alabama, and before he received his doctorate, he looked for politically effective ways to mobilize the state&#146;s 40,000 teachers. In 1969 Hubbert moved to Montgomery as executive secretary of the AEA. Since then, Hubbert has transformed the AEA into the strongest single interest group in Alabama politics. According to one recent study, Hubbert has been a dominant force in the state Democratic party since 1982 (Ehrenhalt, 1991).</P>
<P>In June 1993, for the second time in three years, the steering committee of A-VOTE, the political action committee of the Alabama Education Association, voted to set aside $1 million dollars for a Hubbert gubernatorial campaign. Hubbert, still the executive director of the association, also received $1 million from the same PAC in 1990, when he ran and lost a close race for governor to Republican incumbent Guy Hunt. NEA-PAC contributed $150,000 to the Alabama Democratic Party in 1990; this was the largest NEA-PAC contribution to an organization in that year.</P>
<P>The 1992-1993 NEA Handbook lists AEA membership in toto at 65,644; annual dues for active teachers are $147.50 and includes $80 for support personnel. These amounts include $12 for A-VOTE, thus ensuring substantial funding for AEA-endorsed candidates throughout the state each election year.</P>
<P>A &#147;negative dues check-off&#148; applicable to members of the Alabama Education Association was approved by the 1986 Alabama legislature after support from Hubbert and AEA members. Under this procedure, PAC funds are deducted from each teacher&#146;s paycheck and transferred to the AEA political action committee unless the teacher directs otherwise in writing. This mechanism enables the AEA to raise money, provide talent andorgan-ization, and generate effective voter turnout.</P>
<P>In Hubbert&#146;s 1990 campaign for governor, AEA managers asked the Association&#146;s full-time field representatives (UniServ directors), to help with additional fund raising in their districts for Hubbert&#146;s campaign. Goals were set within each district, with the total AEA A-VOTE goal set at $1 million, or $20 more per member. Although not every member was supporting Hubbert in the primary, some UniServ directors saw the directive as a mandated quota from the executive secretary who was now the gubernatorial candidate, Paul Hubbert (<I>Huntsville Times</I>, 1991).</P>
<P>Hubbert&#146;s salary in 1991 was $122,000, making him the second highest paid executive director of any state teacher organization (<I>Florence Times</I>, 1991). During his campaign for governor in 1990 and again in 1994, Hubbert continued to receive his AEA salary, as well as AEA PAC contributions to his gubernatorial campaign. In addition to providing PAC funds, the Alabama Education Association was a major source of campaign volunteers, as is likely to be the case if and when Hubbert runs for elective office again.</P>

<B> New York: The Cuomo campaigns</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>New York is home to 183,000 teachers, most of whom are members of the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT), the state affiliate of the AFT. One quarter of the entire AFT membership is concentrated there, mainly in New York City; in 1993 state membership was about 150,000.</P>
<P>Like the state affiliates of the NEA, NYSUT is a major player in New York state politics. Its influence was dramatically evident in Mario Cuomo&#146;s gubernatorial campaigns in New York. When Cuomo did not have NYSUT support in 1978, he lost to an opponent who had been endorsed by the teacher unions.</P>
<P>When both NEA and AFT have members in a state, they usually endorse the same candidates, even though the decisions are made independ-ently. Shortly before the 1982 primary, the much smaller New York affiliate of the NEA contributed $10,000 in cash to gubernatorial candidate Cuomo. As Cuomo himself recognized, however, the key to his election prospects was NYSUT&#146;s endorsement and support.</P>
<P>In 1982, Cuomo&#146;s opponent in the Democratic primary was New York City Mayor Ed Koch, who was a strong favorite to win the nomination. In his diary entry for Wednesday, March 10, 1982, Cuomo wrote that he had been approached by a representative of the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) indicating that UFT president Albert Shanker (who was also AFT president) wanted to confer with him. Cuomo&#146;s diary notes the crucial importance of a NYSUT endorsement. &#147;Teachers are perhaps the most effective of all the State&#146;s unions. If they go all out, it will mean telephones and vigorous statewide support. It will also mean some money. I would have had them in 1977 if it had not been for a clumsy meeting I had with Shanker. I must see that I don&#146;t make the same mistake again&#148; (Cuomo, 1984).</P>
<P>Later that year, NYSUT convention delegates gave Cuomo a standing ovation following his speech emphasizing the importance of fundamental skills, discipline and respect, especially for teachers, and the primacy of public schools. Still, Cuomo was concerned that NYSUT might remain neutral in the primary. With less than three weeks before the September 23, 1982 primary, Cuomo addressed some 2,000 AFL-CIO Convention delegates. His speech &#147;turned them upside down&#148; and there seemed to be little doubt that he would be endorsed over Koch.</P>
<P>That morning, before and after his speech, there were rumors about what the teachers would do. By themselves they represented 20 percent of the AFL-CIO delegates. Koch was still maneuvering for union neutrality, which would have been a major victory for him. Meanwhile, Cuomo was concerned that Shanker would recommend neutrality at the teacher caucus the day before the full vote was scheduled. One reason for Cuomo&#146;s concern was that to retain teacher union support, or at least their neutrality, Koch was reported to be interested in restoring the UFT&#146;s right to the check-off of union dues directly out of teacher paychecks. This possibility was based on the fact that the New York Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) had barred the UFT from utilizing the checkoff as a penalty for engaging in illegal strike activity. This penalty had forced the union to collect union dues by other more expensive and time consuming procedures. As governor, Koch could have restored the checkoff by not appealing a PERB proposal to lift the ban. Despite Cuomo&#146;s concern, the teachers voted to endorse him, in spite of the fact that the New York City delegation was sympathetic to neutrality in the primary. Instead, NYSUT gave Cuomo a critical convention victory. Even better for Cuomo, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), disendorsed Koch and then endorsed Cuomo.</P>
<P>With NYSUT and AFL-CIO endorsements, activities, funds, and votes, Cuomo emerged victorious over Koch by a narrow margin in the Democratic primary and went on to win the governorship, also by a narrow margin. Shortly thereafter, a quid pro quo emerged. Cuomo, now governor, supported legislation that required state aid for New York City schools to be spent only for teacher salaries. Over the objections of Mayor Koch, this legislation was enacted despite the fact that the New York City schools were in deplorable, even wretched condition as the result of unrelenting pressures to skimp on maintenance and allocate school funds to teacher salaries and benefits.</P>
<H5><A ID="I22" NAME="I22">
<FONT SIZE=4>Teacher unions and political parties</FONT></A></H5>
<P>Teacher unions overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates at all three levels of government: local, state and national. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) reports show who supports the candidates who run for the 435 seats every two years in the United States House of Representatives. In the 1992 election 398 congressional candidates were endorsed and supported by total NEA-PAC contributions of $2,340,796. Of those endorsed by NEA-PAC 369 or 92 percent were Democrats, 29 or 7 percent were Republicans. NEA-PAC endorsed candidates for the House of Representatives won 71 percent of their races in the 1992 election cycle.</P>
<P>The NEA&#146;s pro-Democratic tilt is just as evident in the elections to the U.S. Senate. With one-third of the 100 Senators up for election every two years, NEA-PAC endorses and contributes to senate candidates, while carefully monitoring each senator&#146;s votes during the six-year term. In 1992 NEA-PAC endorsed or supported 39 senate candidates with contributions of $279,831. Of those Senate candidates supported by NEA-PAC, 38 or 97 percent were Democrats; one, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, was a Republican. NEA-PAC contributed $2,000 to Specter&#146;s primary campaign, none to his campaign in the general election; meanwhile, his Democratic opponent, Lynn Yeakel, received $5,000 for the Democratic primary and $5,000 for the general election against Specter. The $2,000 contribution to Specter&#146;s primary campaign was unusual; although NEA-PAC also supports Congressional candidates in primary elections; such support also goes almost exclusively to Democratic candidates. NEA-PAC endorsed candidates for the United States Senate in 1992 won in 68 percent of their races.</P>
<P>Endorsements and contributions are not the only way in which the NEA and NEA-PAC influences lawmakers. In 1989 it spent $7.4 million on a computerized system for sending letters to Congress from 300,000 NEA members who pre-authorized the use of their names (Toch, 1991). Congressional Contact Teams, consisting of two NEA members from each congressional district are encouraged to serve on the campaign staff of candidates endorsed by the NEA. These individuals are specially trained as lobbyists and flown to and from Washington to encourage the successful candidates to support NEA objectives. A satellite linkup between the NEA&#146;s television studio in Washington and its state affiliates is available, and a full time lobbying staff is on duty throughout the year.</P>
<P>Clearly, the NEA has evolved into one of the most powerful special interest organizations in the political arena. Its influence extends to every state and community where teachers and support personnel live or work, which means just about everywhere in the United States.</P>
<P>If one were merely to add the political resources of the NEA and AFT and their state and local affiliates, the result would be an immense organization that is certain to tilt a wide range of public policies toward union and liberal Democratic positions. The fact is, however, that an additive process tends to underestimate the political potential of NEA/AFT. One reason is that the NEA/AFT will probably organize a much larger proportion of school related personnel than the two unions have organized separately up to this time. It would not be surprising if NEA/AFT organized at least one million support personnel within a few years after merger. If the actual numbers turn out to be anywhere close to this figure, or even higher, the NEA/AFT will be a political behemoth indeed.</P>
<P>Politically, the NEA and AFT are affiliates of the Democratic Party, complete with the ethnic, victim, and special interest caucuses that dominate that party. About one in ten delegates to the 1992 Democratic National Convention was a member of the NEA or AFT. When NEA-PAC rated members of Congress on 14 votes of special interest to the NEA, 23 Democratic senators received a perfect score and 11 others voted the NEA&#146;s position 90 percent or more of the time. No Republican senator voted the NEA&#146;s position on 90 percent or more of the votes. No Democratic senator voted against the NEA&#146;s position on more than 40 percent of the votes, whereas 32 Republican senators did so, with two never supporting the NEA&#146;s position and seven others supporting it less than 10 percent of the time. The AFT pattern was very similar, as was the AFL-CIO&#146;s.</P>
<P>Unquestionably, the cash contributions were overshadowed by the value of the noncash contributions, such as manpower for demonstrations, mailings, telephone banks, transportation to the polls, publicity in union media, and so on. Teachers as well as union staff have much more time than most citizens to serve as campaign volunteers; for many, it is a social outlet as well as a responsibility. Right to life partisans are the only conservative presence in both NEA and AFT conventions, but their influence is negligible. There is no Republican caucus in the AFT; the NEA Republican caucus, discussed in Chapter 4, is a paper organization bereft of program, strategy, or sense of mission, as well as of members who play an active role in NEA affairs. The Republican caucus was much stronger in 1974, when some Republican members of the House of Representatives as well as the Assistant Secretary of Education (under the Secretary for Health, Education and Welfare) took an active interest in it. It was clear then that the teacher unions would be a major player in national politics and that they would be controlled by the Democratic Party by default unless action was taken to avert this outcome. The Republican Educational Caucus in the 1970s got off to an excellent start, but floundered and sank into oblivion as a result of Watergate and the Republican National Committee (RNC) preoccupation with other matters. It became practically impossible to persuade teachers to work with the Republican party while President Nixon was being hammered daily in the media and facing impeachment. The existing Republican caucus in the NEA has the formal blessing of the Republican National Committee, but no meaningful support or leadership from it.</P>
<P>Merger will render it impossible for conservative forces to ignore the teacher unions. Of course, these forces already realize that the teacher unions support anti-conservative positions, but they lack any program or strategy to change the situation. This is partly due to their ignorance about teacher union structure, leadership, revenues, governance documents, dynamics&#151;just about everything that matters. With merger, or closer cooperation between the NEA and AFT, this situation is unlikely to continue. The conservative forces will have to focus on the teacher unions as they have never done before. It will take a while and some expensive adult education, but the change from not so benign neglect to a conservative focus on teacher unions is inevitable.</P>

<IMG SRC="neafbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 49><B> CHAPTER 6 -- </B><B>Union Sponsored Member Benefit Programs</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>The primary function of most unions is the negotiation of favorable terms and conditions of employment for employees represented by the union. This function also includes ensuring that the employer live up to the terms of the contract negotiated with the union; the most common way to do this is to negotiate a grievance procedure culminating in binding arbitration of claims that the employer has failed to abide by the terms of the contract.</P>
<P>Although the union&#146;s ability to negotiate benefits paid by the employer is paramount, most unions also sponsor benefit programs paid by the union or by union members. Teacher unions are especially active in this regard; both the NEA and AFT offer a wide range of products and services to their members. These operations have not received the attention they deserve, perhaps because they seem so familiar to the educational community. Whatever the reason, union sponsored benefit programs can play an important role in building union membership. Because of their large membership base, the teacher unions can often take advantage of economies of scale in buying goods or services. Also, because teachers are relatively attractive to vendors from a demographic and economic point of view, the unions can sometimes negotiate lower prices for various services. To be sure, unions, including teacher unions have sometimes sponsored benefit programs of dubious value to union members. First, however, let us note the range of services provided by union sponsored programs. Including services offered by the state as well as the national teacher unions, the list includes the following:</P>

<P>        auto purchase/lease</P>
<P>        book clubs/magazine subscriptions</P>
<P>        legal services</P>
<P>These services are provided in different ways. Some are provided directly by the unions. Some are provided by independent contractors who may or may not have secured a contract through a competitive bidding process. The extent of union involvement may also vary widely. In the following discussion, we focus mainly on the member benefit operations of the two national unions, but we believe that the member benefit operations of their state and local affiliates deserve more scrutiny than they have received in the past.</P>
<P>NEA member benefits operations consists of a complex arrangement of subsidiaries, funds, and fund transfers which provide revenue and services to help support the NEA, its programs, and its political operations. To the majority of members, the NEA political agenda is of secondary concern; most members join the NEA primarily for the job protection and teacher welfare benefits that accompany membership. Legal protection and/or legal representation are provided to NEA members in matters relating to teacher/student conduct or terms and conditions of employment. In addition, NEA members are automatically covered by NEA Dues-Tab Insurance (underwritten by Prudential Insurance Company of America, Inc.), which provides up to $1,000 life insurance, $5,000 accidental death and dismemberment insurance and up to $50,000 job related accidental death and dismemberment. At the same time, however, most NEA subsidiary operations provide millions of dollars in union revenue. In addition, the property holdings and assets of the subsidiaries provide the NEA with even greater resources to utilize for a variety of purposes. Although not all subsidiary operations are member benefits, the collective purchasing power of the more than two million NEA members obviously offers unique opportunities for member benefits. Understandably, as benefit opportunities have expanded, so has the organizational structure necessary to provide the requisite special services.</P>
<H5><A ID="I2" NAME="I2">
<FONT SIZE=4>NEA special services</FONT></A></H5>
<P>The NEA Special Services area includes contracts for 1) investment services (annuity, money market account); 2) financial services (credit card, credit plans); 3) personal services (discount rental car programs, magazine service, and computer marketing); and 4) insurance through the National Education Association Members Insurance Trust (life, accidental death and dismemberment, health, homeowners, etc).</P>
<H5><A ID="I3" NAME="I3">
<FONT SIZE=4>NEA Member Benefits Corporation</FONT></A></H5>
<P>As a wholly owned subsidiary of the NEA, the Member Benefits Corporation (MBC) is retained by the NEA to administer the contracts held by the National Education Association&#146;s Special Services area. In order to market these special services to NEA members, the NEA created the MBC, a for-profit corporation which recovers its costs for administration, marketing, research and development, training, member service, and affiliate service support for NEA Special Services through written agreements between NEA Special Services and NEA&#146;s Member Benefits Corporation. The MBC is governed by three executive officers, each of whom also serves on the NEA Board of Directors and who receive annual payments from $67,000 to over $100,000. MBC total assets for the period ended August 31, 1992 exceeded $2 million.</P>
<H5><A ID="I4" NAME="I4">
<FONT SIZE=4>NEA Members Insurance Trust</FONT></A></H5>
<P>The NEA Members Insurance Trust (the Trust) is a separate, tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended. Prudential Insurance Company of America, Inc. underwrites life insurance and accidental death, dismemberment and disability insurance. Washington National Insurance Company underwrites a more comprehensive program of disability insurance. Both programs, which entitle NEA members to purchase group life and other insurance benefits, are classified as employee benefit plans. The Trust also provides an all-member life insurance benefit known as the &#147;Dues-Tab Program&#148; at no cost to the members. As mentioned above, the Trust is a part of the Special Services area and is therefore administered by the Members Benefit Corporation which provides administrative and promotional services for the Trust programs. For the year ended August 31, 1992, the NEA Members Insurance Trust had total assets of $88,159,667.</P>
<P>Further, the Trust has entered into an agreement with NEA to provide data processing services for the maintenance of the Dues-Tab membership files. Under this agreement, the Trust reimburses NEA $75,000 per year or $.04 per member, whichever is greater. In addition, during 1992, the Trust remitted $500,000 to NEA for a portion of the costs associated with the NEA Systems 2000 project, a software development project. NEA officers, directors and members hold all of the five trustee positions which direct the activities of the NEA Members Insurance Trust.</P>

<B> NEA legal assistance funds and programs</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<H5><A ID="I6" NAME="I6">
<FONT SIZE=4>NEA Employees Assistance Fund, Inc.</FONT></A></H5>
<P>The National Education Employees Assistance Fund, Inc. (NEEAF) is another nonprofit corporation providing assistance to NEA members. NEEAF was incorporated in 1970 to provide a vehicle for interest-free loans through lending institutions to the NEA members of the 38 NEA state affiliates who are members of NEEAF. The program is implemented and administered as a strike loan program. In this connection, NEEAF has guaranteed loans made by lending institutions to teachers who were involved in such disputes. These loans are secured by letters of credit from those state affiliates which are members of NEEAF and also by NEA&#146;s line of credit.</P>
<P>Two-thirds of the interest on the loans to members is paid by the state association and one-third is paid by NEEAF. In the event of default, all loans provided by the lending institutions are guaranteed by NEEAF up to one-half of the loan amount; the balance of the loans is guaranteed by the respective state associations. NEEAF&#146;s financial activities are included in the special purpose funds of NEA and are budgeted by the Representative Assembly. Under provisions of Section 501(c)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code and the applicable income tax regulations of the District of Columbia, NEEAF is exempt from income taxes.</P>
<P>NEA provides both accounting and management services to the National Education Employee Assistance Fund at no charge, and appropriated $100,000 to the Fund in 1992. As a member of NEEAF, the NEA maintains a letter of credit, which accounts for approximately 50 percent of the NEEAF&#146;s available letters of credit. Currently, combined letters of credit exceed $4 million; NEEAF is contingently liable in the event of default for just over $1.5 million. Between December 18, 1989 and February 28, 1990, NEEAF loaned a total of $1,282,000 to the TerreBonne Education Association Federal Credit Union for use in loans to striking teachers who were members of the Louisiana Education Association. By June 30, 1992, although most of the note had been paid off; $27,236 in loan defaults were written off.</P>
<H5><A ID="I7" NAME="I7">
<FONT SIZE=4>NEA Kate Frank/DuShane Fund</FONT></A></H5>
<P>Another benefit of NEA membership is the availability of legal assistance from the Kate Frank/DuShane Fund (the &#147;Fund&#148;) which was established by the Representative Assembly to protect the human, civil and professional rights of educators. The major program of the Fund is the Unified Legal Services Program, which provides legal assistance to members of the teaching profession in matters related to their employment. An educator may request assistance from the NEA Office of Legal Services by first contacting the local UniServ representative or the legal services office of the state affiliate. The 1993 RA voted to pay up to 46% of state costs of legal representation to guarantee adherence to local contracts and collective bargaining agreements; to uphold state fair dismissal laws; to protect constitutionally guaranteed free expression rights, including academic freedom and political association; and to fight job discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, or ethnic or cultural origins. For 1993-94 almost $17 million was budgeted for the DuShane Unified Legal Services Program.</P>
<H5><A ID="I8" NAME="I8">
<FONT SIZE=4>Educators Employment Liability Program</FONT></A></H5>
<P>The Educators Employment Liability Program provides coverage for up to $4 million in damages and additional payments for legal fees for most civil and some criminal lawsuits. This program provides protection for members from personal financial liability when NEA members are sued as a result of employment related activities, such as accidents occurring to students while members are teaching or supervising educational activities. NEA fully funds the insurance premium for this program.</P>
<H5><A ID="I9" NAME="I9">
<FONT SIZE=4>Association Professional Liability Program</FONT></A></H5>
<P>The Association Professional Liability Program protects local, state, and national association officers and staff from personal financial liability in lawsuits resulting from their advocacy on behalf of NEA and its members. All funds are administered at the National Education Association Washington, D.C. office.</P>
<H5><A ID="I10" NAME="I10">
<FONT SIZE=4>NEA Attorney Referral Program</FONT></A></H5>
<P>Through the Attorney Referral Program, members have access to a national panel of NEA-approved attorneys for personal legal matters such as preparation of wills, real estate matters, divorce proceedings, and consumer complaints. Participant attorneys may provide advice and consultation at no charge and discount their usual fees by 30 percent as a service to NEA members.</P>

<B> Direct services to members</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>From an NEA standpoint, the member services available for purchase are overshadowed by those made available to members and affiliates without charge directly through NEA administrative units. For instance, NEA publishes several periodicals for the general membership as well as others for interest groups within the NEA, such as for higher education and educational support personnel. Advertising in member publications often includes the NEA Member Benefits and Special Services.</P>
<P>The programs offering direct services to members typically reflect the NEA&#146;s political and social orientation. Thus the union&#146;s programs focus on such topics as &#147;women&#146;s and girls issues,&#148; &#147;equal access and minority leadership training,&#148; or &#147;women&#146;s leadership training.&#148; In this connection, it is instructive to note how the NEA&#146;s transformation from professional association to union impacted its programmatic orientation. Prior to unionization, the NEA was the organizational base for several national organizations devoted to curriculum and instruction. These organizations, such as the National Science Teachers Association and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, had their own organizational structure but were affiliated with NEA and housed in the NEA building. The NEA&#146;s Research Division was a rich source of information on virtually all aspects of education. With the emergence of teacher bargaining, however, the curriculum and instruction organizations withdrew from the NEA as did organizations of principals and school administrators. Meanwhile, the NEA&#146;s Research Division focused on school finance, cost of living, and other topics primarily related to teacher bargaining. Most of its work is backup for NEA and its affiliates on bargaining or compensation or revenue issues.</P>

<B> NEA state association benefit programs</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The NEA&#146;s state affiliates often sponsor member benefit plans of their own. We do not have systematic data on the number, scope, resources or administration of these plans, but there is at least one overriding reason to scrutinize their operations more carefully than in the past. As previously noted, the state and local affiliates of the NEA and AFT are not subject to federal regulation of union activities. Appendix E sets forth the reporting and disclosure requirements in federal statutes that are not applicable to state and local teacher unions. The inapplicability of the federal statutes is compounded by the fact that the state bargaining laws typically omit the reporting and disclosure requirements as well as the union member rights incorporated in the federal statutes. In the absence of such reporting and disclosure requirements, union officials are more likely to abuse their positions, to the detriment of their members and/or their employers.</P>
<P>A recent case in point emerged in November 1993, when The Mackinac Center for Public Policy published a report entitled <I>Michigan Education</I><U> </U><I>Special Services Association: The MEA&#146;s Money </I><I>Machine.</I> According to the Mackinac Center report, the Michigan Education Association owns and controls three subsidiary corporations: the Michigan Education Special Serv-ices Association (MESSA), the Michigan Education Association Financial Services, and the Michigan Education Data Network Association (MEDNA).</P>
<P>In 1960 MESSA was incorporated by the MEA as a wholly-owned, not-for-profit subsidiary to administer insurance benefit programs to participating MEA members. Life, accidental death and dismemberment, disability, health, dental, and vision coverage are included in the insurance programs. Local affiliate unions of the MEA are encouraged to bargain MESSA insurance plans into their labor contracts with their respective school districts. In such cases, the corporation which administers insurance benefits to the school district&#146;s employees is also a part of the organization which represents the school district&#146;s employees during contract negotiations. When this occurs, the MEA has unprecedented leverage in controlling the compensatory benefits received by its members. In 1962 MESSA  received $360 million from approximately 60 percent of Michigan&#146;s school districts for insurance coverage of school district employees, including teachers,support staff,and administrators.</P>
<P>Similar to NEA subsidiary governance, the two most recent appointees to the MESSA Board of Trustees are the incumbent president and vice-president of the MEA. In addition, six of the trustees are elected from and by the MEA Board of Directors.</P>
<P>In 1973, the MEA created the Michigan Education Financial Services Association. Now known as MEA Financial Services, this subsidiary provides MEA members with numerous investment services, including annui-ties, investment retirement accounts, credit cards, mutual funds, auto owners insurance, and home owners insurance, again, much like the NEA Special Services program.</P>
<P>In 1982, The Michigan Education Data Network Association (MEDNA) was established as a wholly-owned, for profit subsidiary of the MEA. Unlike the other subsidiaries, but comparable to the NEA&#146;s MBC, MEDNA&#146;s purpose is to service the MEA rather than MEA&#146;s members. MEDNA provides a wide range of clerical and administrative services to the MEA and its other subsidiaries, including data processing, communications, and accounting. And like the MBC at the national level, MEDNA receives compensation from the MEA and its other subsidiaries, forming a lucrative resource pool for the whole MEA conglomerate. </P>
<P>In regard to the relationship between the MEA and its subsidiaries (see Table 6.1), the Mackinac Center report concluded that &#147;Both the Michigan Education Special Services Association (MESSA) and the Michigan Education Association (MEA) have the necessary resources to fight any attempt at restraining the MESSA operation. The MEA can manipulate many public officials through campaign contributions and political pressure, and MESSA has enough financial reserves to pay for legal services, lobbying staff, and other programs necessary to combat its opposition. Moreover, MESSA can recuperate the costs of self-defense by increasing premium rates, inducing more illegitimate taxpayer support&#148; (Bockelman and Overton, 1993).</P>
<P>It is only fair to point out that the MEA and MESSA have vigorously denied the validity of the Mackinac Center report, nor have the authors of this book had the time or opportunity to conduct their own assessment of the charges in the report. We will say, however, that the abuses set forth in the report are likely to exist in some of the state associations; in fact, it would be surprising if they did not exist in some states.</P>

<B> AFT member benefit programs</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>AFT Plus includes nine AFT officially sponsored group insurance plans for its members. Programs and coverage appear to be similar to the NEA options. The AFT office of the secretary-treasurer is responsible for monitoring and negotiating national AFT member benefits.</P>
<P>Union Privilege, AFL-CIO was created by the AFL-CIO in 1986 to bring union members and their families high quality consumer benefits and serv-ices. When adopted by the American Federation of Teachers (or any other affiliated union) these programs are designed to help make the dollars union members earn go further and to make the union a more vital part of members&#146; daily lives.</P>
<P>Union Privilege benefits include a low-interest credit card, discounts on such services as travel, car rentals, moving vans, and theme park admissions and the mortgage program for buying or refinancing a home, music and video discounts. By endorsing programs which are specially designed for union members and which offer genuine value and superior member serv-ice, the collective purchasing strength of over 14 million union members can be utilized to benefit union members.</P>

<P>The AFT Defense Fund provides assistance to locals and state federations to help protect the rights of AFT members. Applications of less than $2,000 may be approved by the five member defense committee. In most states, the defense committee recommends that AFT locals 
<BR>and state federation share the legal costs on a one-third each basis. Cases most often involve AFT member job security and the necessity to protect the members&#146; right to due process. In addition, the defense fund provides grants in arbitration cases when the arbitration involves job security. 
<BR>If a request is for more than $2,000, the defense committee makes

<B> Policy issues in member benefits</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The preceding discussion has not analyzed teacher union benefit programs in detail; our purpose was mainly to invite attention to an important dimension of union activity that is widely ignored in the literature on teacher unions. It seems apparent, however, that union sponsored benefit programs raise several significant policy issues.</P>
<P>The rationale for these programs is that by using their large membership base, the unions can enable their members to buy products and services more efficiently and at a lower cost than they could otherwise. We have no quarrel with this rationale, but we do have some reservations about the way it is being implemented. Our major reservations are as follows:</P>
<P>1. Clearly, union sponsored benefit programs constitute a conflict of interest in some situations. Consider the example of the Michigan Education Special Services Association (MESSA), which is a wholly owned nonprofit subsidiary of the Michigan Education Association (MEA). MESSA sells insurance plans (most often health insurance plans) to school districts.</P>
<P>   In 1992, MESSA received over $360 million in revenues and provided insurance plan administration for over 300 of the 523 K-12 school districts in Michigan. Inasmuch as the identity of the insurance carrier is a mandatory subject of bargaining in Michigan, negotiators for MEA affiliates are likely to recommend MESSA insurance plans, even if benefit costs and costs of administration are excessive. Typically, the union cares more about benefits than costs. Realistically, neither the average teacher nor the school district is in a position to challenge the MEA representative who negotiates scores of school district contracts every year, and who may threaten a teacher strike if the school district resists the union program.</P>
<P>   If the MEA itself had opened the insurance program to competitive bidding, there would not necessarily be a conflict of interest. However, if and when the administrator, such as MESSA, is a union subsidiary that faces potential competition from other vendors, the conflict exists, regardless of whether the union subsidiary is nonprofit or for profit.</P>
<P>2. By using wholly owned subsidiaries, the teacher unions may be able to take advantage of legal freedoms that apply to one organizational entity but not to others.</P>
<P>Because unions, nonprofit organizations and for profit organizations operate under different statutes, the member benefit corporations can be used to shift or transfer funds to avoid disclosure that would be embarrassing or even illegal if reported accurately. For example, the in-kind contributions of subsidiaries in political campaigns may come under less stringent requirements than those pertaining directly to the unions per se.</P>
<P>Actually, the unions often have a stake in avoiding disclosure of certain practices that are commendable but do not conform to union ideology. For instance, the unions sometimes do invite competitive bidding on their member benefit programs. In other words, they use the same practice that they would deny to governments when the latter seek providers for government services, such as health insurance plans for public school teachers.</P>
<P>In view of the many transfers of funds between the NEA, the AFT, and their state and local affiliates, it is often impossible even for members to understand union operations. The NEA&#146;s UniServ program is a striking example of a &#147;local&#148; operation that is actually financed in large part from national union funds.</P>

<IMG SRC="neafbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 49><B> CHAPTER 7 -- </B><B>NEA/AFT Merger: A Historical Perspective</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>In both the NEA and AFT, interest in merger talks has waxed and waned since 1960. In that year, Myron Lieberman published <I>The Future of Public</I><U> </U><I>Education</I>, a book that proposed merger on the basis of no affiliation with the AFL-CIO and the expulsion of administrators from the NEA. At the time, Lieberman believed that affiliation with the AFL-CIO was the major organizing obstacle to the AFT; also, that administrator membership in the NEA was incompatible with teacher bargaining, which he believed to be imminent (Lieberman, 1960).</P>
<P>Although some activists in both the NEA and AFT agreed with this analysis, they were not well organized in either union. During the 1960s and early 1970s the NEA could probably have forced a merger by cutting a deal with AFT leaders who were not enamored of affiliation with the AFL-CIO. There were a sizable number of such leaders; after all, despite having just published a book urging disaffiliation with the AFL-CIO and despite an inept campaign, Lieberman received one third of the votes for the AFT presidency at its 1962 convention.</P>
<P>In the early 1970s, the NEA might have achieved merger by offering inducements to AFT leaders to bring their locals with them if and when these leaders switched over to the NEA. To effectuate a merger, the strategy need not have been successful with all or even most AFT locals; only enough of them to force the others to the table to salvage what they could from a deteriorating situation. Although some of its strategists wanted to adopt this strategy, the NEA did not do so; instead it focused upon defeating AFT locals in representation elections. This strategy naturally led the NEA to portray the AFT and AFL-CIO as evil forces to be avoided at all costs, a posture the NEA is now trying to change with the advent of merger talks.</P>
<P>Merger talks did take place in 1973 and 1974, but they broke down very quickly, and the unions lapsed back into their combat modes (Selden, 1985). According to Selden, the talks ostensibly broke down over affiliation with the AFL-CIO and the guarantee of minority participation. Selden, however, believed that these might have been resolved if Shanker had not privately been opposed to merger. During the time in 1972-74 when the merger talks were going on, Shanker had amassed enough support in the AFT to replace Selden as president. In Selden&#146;s view, Shanker feared that merger would have forced Shanker to give up his control over the AFT and to take his chances in a newly merged organization in which his AFT supporters would be vastly outnumbered. Paradoxically, there was also a fear in some NEA quarters at the time that a merger would lead to a &#147;Shanker takeover&#148; of the merged organization. In this connection, it is interesting that Shanker tried to remove Selden from office as AFT president in 1973 for allegedly exceeding his authority in discussing merger with NEA leaders (Selden, 1985).</P>
<P>From time to time, however, mergers have taken place at the local level, usually on the basis of dual membership in the NEA and AFT and affiliation with the AFL-CIO. This solution did not attract much support and because of the costs involved, it is unlikely to be widely adopted in the 1990s. New York was the only state in which there was a merger at the state level, but the merger there did not survive the anti-merger sentiment that pervaded the NEA in the 1970s.</P>
<P>It should be kept in mind, however, that the long-time existence of rival unions competing for the same members is the exception, not the usual outcome in the labor movement. During the time when sophisticated leadership might have averted the organizational stalemate that eventually emerged, the NEA was a badly divided organization with an extremely diffuse governance structure. Survival, not principle, drove the NEA to embrace teacher bargaining; indeed, the NEA&#146;s initial response to AFT victories in representation elections was to establish an &#147;urban project,&#148; in the naive belief that collective bargaining was an issue limited to urban areas. The NEA did not explicitly accept union status or terminology or philosophy until the window of opportunity to merge without affiliation had closed, and merger talks were the only way to achieve a unified teacher organization. Today, however, there is no practical difference between the two unions regarding the desirability of teacher bargaining. The extent to which affiliation with the AFL-CIO remains as an issue remains to be seen and is discussed later in this chapter.</P>

<B> New Business Items 1993-A and 1993-B: The 1993 convention background</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The NEA&#146;s interest in merger and the possibility of a change in its position on affiliation with the AFL-CIO, was evident in New Business Items 1993-A and 1993-B, adopted by the Representative Assembly at the 1993 NEA convention.</P>
<P>New Business Items A and B were submitted to the Representative Assembly by the NEA&#146;s Board of Directors. The items were originally recommended by a Board of Directors Special Committee, which had been directed to review NEA policies on merger and report back to the board. When the Special Committee did so, the Board of Directors approved the report, including the recommendations that merger talks and moratoriums on merger talks at the state and local levels and on representation challenges be submitted to the 1993 Representative Assembly. The vote on the Board of Directors to do so foreshadowed the substantial majority that the items received in the Representative Assembly vote on July 2 (Geiger, 1993).</P>
<P>Significantly, there had been growing interest in merger talks in the NEA prior to the establishment of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors. In several states characterized by costly competition for bargaining rights and members, merger talks had been initiated or considered in recent years: Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New Mexico, Florida, and California are among these states. In these states, NEA affiliates wanted to explore merger possibilities but were unable to do so because of the NEA&#146;s restrictions on affiliation with the AFL-CIO. The situation brought some pressure to bear on the NEA to avoid an organizational free for all in which its state affiliates might negotiate merger agreements that were not in the best interests of the national organization. At the 1993 NEA convention, a small group was opposed to merger except through a total AFT capitulation to the NEA; a larger group was predisposed to merger and to make significant concessions to achieve it; and a still larger group will undoubtedly be heavily influenced by the proposals and arguments that are submitted to the Representative Assembly in 1994. Of course, even the parties favoring merger do not support it regardless of the arrangements, but they are more likely to make concessions to bring it about.</P>
<P>On its face, the moratoriums on merger talks below the national level and on representation challenges appear only to recognize the fact that the NEA and AFT are firmly entrenched in their respective domains. The possibility of a few successful challenges by either union was deemed not worth the risk that such challenges might disrupt the merger talks. Even apart from this consideration, however, the two moratoriums are extremely significant. In effect, they centralize control of the merger talks in the national leadership of the two unions. (It is possible that other unions, especially unions of support personnel, will be involved in the talks, but because the critical issues are those dividing the AFT and NEA, our analysis will be limited to these two unions.) To be sure, the negotiating teams for the NEA and AFT will confer with their key constituencies during the talks; a great deal of emphasis was placed on this point during the debate in the Representative Assembly. NEA President Keith Geiger assured the delegates that there would be adequate communication between the NEA&#146;s team and various constituencies within the NEA. Nevertheless it should be noted that the moratoriums rule out initiatives by state or local affiliates in both unions. For this reason, the moratoriums place tremendous power in the national leadership of the two unions.</P>
<P>The debate preceding the vote on the merger talks was spirited but essentially irrelevant to the outcome. The proposals for merger talks had been disseminated over a month before the convention, and they were discussed in the various caucuses before the convention vote. It is unlikely that many votes were changed by the debate; clearly, the proponents, led by Geiger, who had just been reelected to a three year term as NEA president, were prepared to defeat maneuvers to block or weaken the merger talks. Or-ganized opposition to the talks emerged in state delegations from New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, and Illinois, but it was clear at the outset of the debate that the opponents of the talks could not block them on a straight up and down vote. Although many delegates voted for the talks with reservations (&#147;Why oppose talks with the AFT?&#148;), many others felt that merger talks would develop a momentum of their own leading to a merger. In their view, voting for merger talks was tantamount to voting for merger. Some of this thinking was based upon the fact that the new business items authorizing the talks explicitly questioned NEA policies prohibiting affiliation with the AFL-CIO, a major obstacle to merger in the past.</P>
<P>Less than a week after the NEA authorized merger talks, the AFT held its annual convention on educational issues in Washington. Interestingly enough, the NEA&#146;s actions were a non-event at the AFT convention; the overwhelming majority of delegates seemed not to care, or even to know about the NEA&#146;s actions. Even AFT President Shanker disclaimed detailed prior knowledge or discussions with NEA leaders on merger issues; however, when asked how the NEA leaders could be so confident that the AFT would accept the moratoriums, Shanker conceded that he had indicated that the moratoriums would not be a problem. Obviously, the leaders in both unions have been very careful to avoid opposition to merger based on failure to follow proper organizational procedures. Whether or not they had reached any informal agreement before New Business Items 1993-A and 1993-B were adopted, they probably have some common reasons to believe the talks will be more productive than previous merger talks.</P>
<P>Teacher affiliation with the AFL-CIO is a major difference between the NEA and AFT; obviously, it is a major issue in the merger talks. In our view, the issue is a practical, not a moral or professional one. By &#147;practi-cal,&#148; we mean that the issue will be resolved on the basis of whether teachers believe that they will be better off if affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Of course, the answer to this question does not necessarily answer the question of whether teacher affiliation with the AFL-CIO is in the public interest, or whether the public interest is or should be a factor in how the issue is resolved.</P>
<P>Although affiliation is a merger issue, affiliation or non-affiliation should not be grounds for opposing merger if one accords the highest priority to a unified teacher organization. That is, regardless of whether one favors or opposes affiliation, it should not be grounds for opposing merger if one&#146;s highest priority is a unified teacher union.</P>
<P>We do not believe that affiliation with the AFL-CIO will be a make or break issue in the merger talks. Our point is not that all teachers will be required to affiliate, or prohibited from doing so. Our thought is only that the issue will be resolved in a mutually satisfactory way in the merger talks. The resolution may be only a short-term one, but merger will not be held up over the issue.</P>
<P>Conceptually, there are at least two ways to approach the affiliation issue. One is to examine the AFL-CIO constitution to ascertain the implications of &#147;affiliation,&#148; at least as they are evident from it. The other way is to analyze the arguments for and against affiliation without regard to the AFL-CIO constitution or any other document. In this case, however, both approaches lead to the same conclusions.</P>
<P>A perusal of its constitution reveals a surprising fact about affiliation with the AFL-CIO. Except for payment of per capita taxes (dues) to the AFL-CIO there does not appear to be any significant substantive commitment involved in affiliation with the Federation. Of course, there are seve-ral organizational requirements and procedures, such as the determination of voting strength at conventions and procedures for becoming affiliated, but there is no restriction on policy positions that can be adopted or taken. The AFL-CIO constitution does provide for the investigative and disciplinary procedures relating to corrupt affiliates, or to affiliates whose policies or activities &#147;are consistently directed toward the advocacy, support, advancement or achievement of the program or of the purposes of the Communist Party, any fascist organization or other totalitarian movement&#148; (Article 8, Section 7, AFL-CIO Constitution). It is unlikely that a significant number of NEA members would take exception to these provisions, at least to the extent of insisting that they be eliminated or amended as a condition of merger.</P>
<P>Despite the concerns over teacher union autonomy under affiliation, the AFL-CIO constitution emphasizes the autonomy of its constituent unions; its ability to act for all is much more problematic than any danger of infringing on the autonomy of an affiliated union. The following provisions illustrate this point:</P>

<P>The financial obligations of affiliation are significant but not especially onerous. AFT dues are $8.55 per month ($102.60 annually) for regular full-time teachers. State Federation dues vary but are almost always much less than state association dues in the NEA. Local dues also vary, but are comparable or even higher than local association dues in the NEA. Beginning in January 1993, each national affiliate of the AFL-CIO is obligated to pay 40 cents per month per member, payable on or before the 15th of the month for the preceding month. The per capita tax for members who are 
<BR>not &#147;regular members&#148; or who &#147;receive less than the full range of the union&#146;s representation services is two-thirds of the regular per capita to the nearest whole cent,&#148; or 26 cents per month per member. Under certain circumstances not likely to be applicable to the NEA, the AFL-CIO&#146;s Executive Council can raise the per capita one cent per member per month.</P>
<P>The 1993-94 NEA budget is based on the equivalent of 2,208,000 regular members. At $.40 per member per month, its annual financial obligation to the AFL-CIO would be $4.80 per member, or almost $10,600,000 annually. This figure does not include the per capita paid to local and state central labor bodies. These figures will vary, but would not be a major obstacle to merger.</P>
<P>The AFL-CIO was established on the basis that the economic interests of workers in various industries necessarily outweigh their conflicting or divergent interests. This is a fallacy sustained by faulty economics. For example, when the auto workers receive wage increases, the popular view is that their &#147;employers&#148; pay for them. Actually, the wage increases are passed on to car buyers in the form of higher prices, paid by the members of other unions in the AFL-CIO as well as by the public generally.</P>
<P>The counter argument is that the mutual assistance unions in the AFL-CIO receive outweighs the costs they inflict on each other. Thus the question is whether the union members give up more as consumers than they gain as producers through their affiliation with the AFL-CIO. It is not at all clear that the benefits outweigh the costs, at least all of the time to all of the unions in the AFL-CIO. The issue is really an empirical, not an ideological one. One can argue that the gains due to affiliation clearly outweigh the costs because parties outside the AFL-CIO, such as the unorganized, absorb most of the costs of the gains achieved through affiliation.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there is a significant and growing conflict of interest between the public and private sector unions in the AFL-CIO. The private sector unions are more likely to be hurt by high taxes and government expenditures, whereas public sector unions are strongly opposed to limits on taxes and government expenditures (Troy, 1993). Of course, it might also be argued that affiliation is imperative precisely to avoid such a split in the labor movement.</P>
<P>The opponents of affiliation in the NEA fear that the AFL-CIO will restrict the NEA&#146;s independence or autonomy. As previously pointed out, this is about as likely as the NEA interfering with the autonomy or independence of the airline pilots or autoworkers, which is to say it is extremely unlikely. The basic issue is whether the teachers are willing to help other unions inflict higher costs on the rest of the population, including the disadvantaged, in exchange for the help these unions give the NEA to achieve its objectives. Many, perhaps most, teachers are willing to do so. The problem is that the teachers are being urged to accept affiliation on the basis of its benefits, while its real costs are totally ignored in the irrelevant debate over &#147;autonomy&#148; or &#147;independence.&#148; The teachers might well conclude that the benefits are worth the real costs, including the cost of giving up their cherished belief that teachers are much concerned about the disadvantaged; the latter are the largest group disadvantaged by the AFL-CIO policies generally. In any event, affiliation is not a moral issue or one of high principle, as it is made out to be by partisans on both sides of the issue.</P>
<P>From a public interest point of view, teacher affiliation with the AFL-CIO would have some benefits. No one takes seriously the idea that unions of autoworkers or teamsters or restaurant workers, for example, exist to protect the consumers. The legal and practical role of unions is to advance the interests of their members, regardless of whether the unions label themselves &#147;professional associations&#148; or some other self-serving title. This is not a pejorative comment. People have the right to be represented by organizations that advance their interests, and most people belong to such organizations. Affiliation with the AFL-CIO would help to remove the veneer of dedication to children that still permeates NEA rhetoric and obscures clear thinking about public policies toward teacher unions.</P>
<P>In any event, the wording of the NEA resolutions on merger talks demonstrates NEA willingness to move away from rigid opposition to affiliation. Inasmuch as the NEA is not likely to impose affiliation on all of its state and local affiliates, affiliation is likely to be a state and/or local option. Such an option, however, is likely to be only an interim solution. Over time, the state organizations with mandatory affiliation will become a majority and be able to coerce or persuade the remaining state organizations to accept affiliation. This will happen when and if the pro-affiliation forces can require affiliation without substantial defections from the merged organization. In the meantime, anyone who opposes merger because affiliation with the AFL-CIO is mandatory, or because it is not mandatory, probably has an agenda that does not accord a high priority to an NEA/AFT merger.</P>
<P>In this connection, it is doubtful whether a large majority within the AFT strongly supports affiliation with the AFL-CIO; in our view, it is an open question whether rank and file AFT members care deeply about the issue, one way or the other. AFT members support affiliation with varying degrees of commitment, or tolerate it, but most probably would not require much persuasion or major concessions to change their position. Significantly, more than two years after proposing merger on the basis of no affiliation with the AFL-CIO and the exclusion of administrative personnel from the merged organization, Lieberman received one-third of the votes for AFT president at its 1962 national convention. In addition:</P>
<P>1. David Selden, AFT president before Shanker, was willing to move away from a rigid affiliation requirement in the 1974 merger talks. Selden wanted to propose an opt-out provision, whereby members of the merged organization would have the option not to have any of their dues go to the AFL-CIO. Because he was a lame duck president in a union that had come under Shanker&#146;s control, Selden was not able to make this offer to the NEA merger team (Selden, 1985).</P>
<P>2. Many AFT locals are in communities where there is no central trades and labor council affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Affiliation is a state and federal, but not local relationship in many of these communities.</P>
<P>3. Evidence from many sources supports the conclusion that the single most important factor keeping affiliation alive as an issue is Shanker&#146;s undeviating insistence upon it in a merger. Of course, affiliation must appeal to some in the AFT or Shanker could not sustain his commitment to it; in many cases, however, the office seekers in the AFT support affiliation out of political expediency, not principle or even organizational welfare. In saying this, we are not passing judgment on the merits, but on the support it has in the AFT. In the large urban centers, affiliation tends to be more useful than in the suburbs, but since the urban school districts are so influential in 
<BR>the AFT, affiliation receives more support than it would according to membership sentiment.</P>
<P>At the 1993 NEA convention, the Illinois Education Association (IEA) raised several serious questions about the advisability of affiliation. For example, the IEA pointed out that most legislative activity affecting private sector unions is at the federal level, but the state level is the critical arena in education. Thus the IEA questioned the value of NEA affiliation with a predominantly private sector organization, especially in view of the fact that the state affiliates of the NEA are usually among the most effective lobbies in the state capitals. The IEA objections, however, failed to recognize the dramatic increase in public sector unions and decline in private sector ones; furthermore, its argument did not mention the possibility of federal legislation that would require state and local governments to bargain collectively, an objective of both the NEA and AFT.</P>
<P>The fact is that the private sector unions no longer overwhelmingly dominate the labor movement. Significantly, about 40 percent of public sector workers are organized, whereas the highest level of union penetration in the private sector was 36 percent in 1953. In 1992, less than 12 percent of private sector workers were unionized, a lower figure than was the case in 1929. If these trends continue, even at a slower pace, the strongest argument for affiliation will be the common interests of NEA members and the members of the AFL-CIO.</P>
<P>The IEA also pointed out that the NEA could affiliate without merger; however, the AFL-CIO, which does not want its constituent federations to compete against each other, is not likely to accept the NEA separately. AFL-CIO unions sometimes do compete for the same workers, but it is something to be avoided if at all possible. Separate affiliation would create internal problems for the AFL-CIO; for example, if the NEA supports ethnic quotas and the AFT opposes them, the AFL-CIO could get involved in controversies between the separate unions. With a single organization, the issue would have to be resolved before it reached the AFL-CIO.</P>
<P>The IEA analysis leaves the impression that affiliation is a mixed bag, which probably is the correct view of it from a teacher perspective. If affiliation is a mixed bag, however, merger should not be hostage to it. Granted, some principles are more important than unification in a single teacher organization. For instance, neither union would or should agree to a merger if certain ethnic groups were denied membership in the merged organization. The fact that the merged organization could and would eliminate the discrimination would not be justification for merger with this restriction, even if it were specifically stated to be in effect for only a short time.</P>
<P>It is difficult, however, to see justification for treating affiliation as this kind of an issue. Theoretically, it would be possible to propose disaffiliation immediately after a merged organization with affiliation comes into existence, but there are likely to be time limits before disaffiliation can be raised. It can be argued that it would be foolish to launch a new organization with an unresolved issue that will divide it from the outset, but how long should the moratorium on this issue be?</P>

<B> The role of Albert Shanker</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The foregoing discussion highlights the role that AFT President Albert Shanker will play in the merger talks. Shanker is a vice-president of the AFL-CIO and a member of the Executive Council, its governing body. The AFL-CIO constitution requires that union representatives on the Executive Council must be one of the &#147;principal officers&#148; of the union. The phrase has never been defined, but in the past, there have only been two exceptions to the tradition of presidents only on the Executive Council. One was Shanker&#146;s acceptance as the 1st vice-president of the AFT. This was made possible only because Shanker had the strong support of AFL-CIO President George Meany, who supported Shanker&#146;s inclusion over the objections of several members of the Executive Council. One factor underlying the opposition to Shanker was the fear that allowing membership on the Executive Council to officers below the rank of president would or could lead to the ascendancy of rivals to the union presidents. It is interesting that Shanker was elected to the position of 1st vice-president of the AFT, a position specifically created to elevate him over the other AFT presidents and thus to strengthen his accession to the Executive Council (Troy, 1993, Selden, 1985).</P>
<P>Minimally, therefore, Shanker would need the vice presidency of NEA/AFT to retain his seat on the AFL-CIO Executive Council. Unquestionably retention of it would be a sine qua non of any merger agreement. Shanker is vice-president of the AFL-CIO, vice-chairman of its Executive Council, the chairman of the General Board of its Department of Professional Employers, and chairman of its International Affairs Committee. Shanker&#146;s enormous personal and professional stake in his AFL-CIO role is also evidenced by his longtime support of its policies, his avoidance of any public criticisms of them or its leaders, and his continual stroking of AFL-CIO causes and leaders in his weekly advertisement in the<I> New York Times</I>. These are only a small part of the evidence that merger is subordinate to affiliation with the AFL-CIO in Shanker&#146;s thinking. Furthermore, it would hardly make sense for NEA/AFT to be represented by a new person when it has available someone with real influence on the AFL-CIO Executive Council. Indeed, the pro-merger forces in the NEA can cite Shanker&#146;s role in the AFL-CIO to justify offering him the vice presidency of NEA/AFT. In any case, it is unthinkable that Shanker would agree to any arrangement that terminated or weakened his role in the AFL-CIO. To be fair about it, however, the AFT has an organizational claim here that is at least as strong as any NEA claim that the top executive officer of the NEA/AFT come from the ranks of the NEA.</P>
<P>There is a problem with this solution. The existing NEA constitution prohibits its executive officers from holding office for more than two consecutive three-year terms. The top three NEA officers were reelected to a second term in 1993. This means that they will no longer be eligible for reelection in 1996, just about the time the constitution of NEA/AFT may go into effect. NEA officers who are adversely affected by the limits on their reelection may try to eliminate them; officers and candidates for office who benefit from the term limits will contend that these term limits should carry over to the governance policies of the merged organization. In both cases the &#147;principle&#148; invoked will be a rationalization of the interests involved. Ultimately NEA leaders will abandon a principle that was adopted for short range reasons. Imagine a candidate for political office who runs on a platform calling for term limits, and then abandons the platform when the term limits would be applicable to the candidate as an officeholder. This is likely to be the picture in the NEA when the merger agreement is presented to its Representative Assembly for approval.</P>
<P>None of this fully answers the question of Shanker&#146;s role in NEA/AFT. Most NEA members feel that because the NEA is the much larger of the two unions, the president of the merged organization should come from the ranks of the NEA. Second, in view of the unclear governance structure of the new organization, it would be difficult for Shanker to organize support within the NEA, even assuming (which we do not) that his immediate objective is the presidency of NEA/AFT. Third, some of the forces within the NEA opposed to merger assert that their opposition is based on their antipathy to Shanker and to his anticipated role in the NEA/AFT. This attitude is probably confined to a small group in the NEA, but an overt power grab by Shanker at the outset would run a significant risk, even though he commands the respect of an influential leadership strata in the NEA.</P>
<P>In our opinion, the logic of the situation leads to the conclusion that Shanker will be the sole or 1st vice-president of NEA/AFT in its initial stages, so that he can remain on the AFL-CIO Executive Council and enhance his leadership position in the AFL-CIO. However, the vice-presidency of NEA/AFT will not solve the problem if NEA/AFT retains term limits on its executive officers. Eliminating the term limits for only the vice presidency would be difficult to defend; eliminating them for all the executive offices would upset a host of plans to run for these offices, and for the offices that would become open if their incumbents run for executive office. These interests are likely to clash with the logic of a Shanker presence on the AFL-CIO Executive Council. In any event, the interrelatedness of term limits on NEA/AFT executive offices and representation of the AFL-CIO Executive Council are sure to be important considerations in the merger talks.</P>

<IMG SRC="neafbksm.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 49><B> CHAPTER 8 -- Merger Issues</B></FONT></A></H3>
<P>This chapter is devoted to various organizational and governance differences between the NEA and AFT. These differences must be resolved to effectuate a merger. It must be emphasized, however, that the differences to be discussed may be overshadowed by many others as serious merger talks proceed. Obviously, one of the most critical issues will be who gets what job in NEA/AFT, but the resolution of this issue will undoubtedly be deferred until a basic agreement on structure and governance is in sight. After all, it would be foolish to negotiate personnel issues before there was any likelihood that the organizational issues had been resolved, or were near solution. In fact, without prior agreement on the structure and govern-ance issues, the negotiating teams would not know what positions were to be filled, let alone who would fill them.</P>
<P>Professionalism as a merger issue</P>
<P>Long before the 1993 NEA convention, many NEA members regarded affiliation with the AFL-CIO as incompatible with professional status. In fact, although most NEA members accept the fact that the NEA is a union, some NEA members still oppose merger on the supposition that the NEA would lose its character as a &#147;professional&#148; organization by merging with the AFT. To understand the relevant issues, we must first clarify the different meanings of &#147;professional&#148; (Lieberman, 1956).</P>
<P>The term &#147;professional&#148; is frequently applied to or denotes expertise, regardless of other considerations. The term is also often applied to individuals who exhibit a strong devotion to clients or consumers. In these contexts, &#147;professional&#148; refers to individual characteristics that are not necessarily related to any particular occupation or organizational structure. Thus one might refer to an editor as a &#147;professional,&#148; meaning that the individual resolves editorial and business issues promptly and efficiently.</P>
<P>For most practical purposes, merger is irrelevant to these definitions of &#147;professional.&#148; If an individual teacher is highly competent, the term &#147;professional&#148; applies, merger or no merger. Similarly, if a teacher shows a deep concern for pupil welfare, the term would be applicable independently of organizational issues. In practice, however, the concept of dedicated teachers as &#147;true professionals&#148; has occasionally come into disrepute within the teacher unions; in some situations, &#147;professional&#148; is a pejorative term, especially in the AFT. Thus at the 1981 Annual Convention, AFT President Albert Shanker commented that &#147;a professional is the closest thing to a propped up dead body that I know of.&#148; Shanker&#146;s comment illustrates the union tendency to equate &#147;professionalism&#148; with meek acceptance of administrative edicts, especially on terms and conditions of employment.</P>
<P>Despite Shanker&#146;s denigration of &#147;professional,&#148; teacher union publications, conferences and policy statements often express a teacher yearning to be considered &#147;professional&#148; in one sense or another. Thus, referring to a brochure entitled <I>How Collective Bargaining Works,</I> the AFT Publications catalog states that &#147;special emphasis is placed on the AFT&#146;s use of collective bargaining to improve professionalism.&#148; Referring to a brochure on the obstacles teachers face, the catalog mentions &#147;commitment to education reform and professionalism for teachers&#148; (<I>AFT Publications Catalog,</I> 1992). These sentiments may simply reflect a vague wish to be a prestigious 
<BR>well-paid occupational group. In any event, we shall adopt and follow the definition proposed by economic historian Richard H. Tawney, to wit, &#147;a profession may be defined most simply as a trade which is organized, incompletely, no doubt, but genuinely, for the performance of function&#148; (Tawney, 1920). However, it is essential to recognize that Tawney assumed that protection of clients/consumers was one of the functions of a profession.</P>
<P>According to the foregoing concept of the professions, a wide range of occupations could be &#147;professions.&#148; For instance, when most citizens need automobile repairs, they must depend on the recommendations of automobile mechanics. The latter frequently have opportunities to advance their own economic interests by recommending services and parts that the car owner does not really need. The situation is similar to the one in which physicians might prescribe drugs that augment physician income but are not helpful to patients. The practical difference is (or was) that pharmacists, not physicians, sell drugs to patients, thereby lessening physician incentives to prescribe drugs on the basis of economic benefits to the physicians.</P>
<P>The suggested concept of professionalism is more applicable to fee takers than to salaried employees, such as teachers. With salaried employees, the employer/consumer has ample opportunities to evaluate the services and to adopt safeguards against unethical conduct. It should be emphasized, however, that under the proposed definition, there are no pejorative implications to the absence of professional status. Professional status is not related to level of education, autonomy in the workplace, or practitioner skill and knowledge but only to whether the occupational group is organized to protect the consumers of the services. Teachers are highly organized, but the purpose of their organizations is to advance the interests of teachers, not of students, parents, taxpayers, or the public at large. Of course, teachers characterize (and often sincerely believe) that their organizational efforts are devoted to the welfare of students or the public, but all interest groups characterize their efforts this way.</P>
<P>Legally and practically, unions are organizations established to protect and defend the interests of their members, not consumers or clients. Of course, unions sometimes act to protect consumers in ways that do not conflict with their producer role, but this is not a major union activity. On this view of professionalism, affiliation with the AFL-CIO is irrelevant to professional status. It may be relevant to public perceptions of teachers as an occupational group, but it is irrelevant to professional status as we have defined it. According to the suggested concept of &#147;profession,&#148; the NEA abandoned the rationale for professional status when it became a union (Lieberman/Hostetler 1980, 1989). Despite its code of ethics, the NEA adheres to the view that it is the employer&#146;s (school administration&#146;s) responsibility to discipline teachers who are incompetent or act unethically. The teacher unions cannot serve as prosecutor, defense attorney, and judge when teachers are accused of misconduct. The effort to do so makes more sense in the fee-taking professions, where the employment relationship is too intermittent and too limited to enable employers to protect themselves from incompetent or unethical conduct. This is not the case with full-time salaried employees who work for a single employer; the latter should be able to deal with misconduct or incompetence in appropriate ways.</P>
<P>Teachers, like union members generally, join unions and pay dues for protective purposes. If their protector becomes their prosecutor, to whom do teachers accused of misconduct turn for representation? For better or for worse, teacher bargaining has laid to rest the idea of education as a self-governing profession; merger and/or affiliation with the AFL-CIO are irrelevant to this issue. A small minority of teachers in the NEA will oppose merger and affiliation with the AFL-CIO on the grounds that these things are contrary to professionalism; their misplaced beliefs will be countered by the equally misplaced claim that merger and affiliation are the path to &#147;true professional status.&#148; Be that as it may, NEA and AFT leaders as well as most union members accord the highest priority to the protective role of unions, and the dynamics of teacher bargaining and union governance would propel them in this direction even if they opposed it.</P>
<P>To be fully effective, a union must avoid competition to perform the work done by union members at a lower rate. For this reason, unions discourage contributed services if the union is seeking or plans to seek compensation for the kind of work involved. This is not to say unionized teachers never do more than what they are contractually required to do. Of course, some do. The point is, however, that the dynamics of unionization and collective bargaining weaken the tendency to perform beyond the legal requirements of the job. To illustrate, suppose that because of budgetary pressures, a school district cannot pay teachers to supervise various extracurricular activities. The teacher who volunteers to supervise the activities without additional compensation is likely to be criticized by other teachers for doing so. In their mind the contributed effort sets a bad example; as the administration ponders what items to cut, it will be more likely to cut the extracurricular budget if it believes that teachers will supervise extracurricular activities for nothing or for a lower stipend. Or let us assume that the union is negotiating for payment to teachers to meet with parents in the evening, or on Saturdays. The teachers will naturally feel that the way to achieve such payment is not to have the service performed without it. Teachers who agree to meet with parents without pay weaken the union&#146;s argument in this regard. In short, any time a teacher is willing to contribute his or her services, there is an erosion or potential erosion of union solidarity on getting paid more for doing less work.</P>
<P>As a matter of fact, the tendency of unionization to discourage contributed services applies even to services contributed by parents. To illustrate, consider an actual situation involving a union representing support personnel in a district forced to undergo severe economic retrenchment. Because of financial exigencies, the district was forced to lay off a nonteaching employee who was responsible for financial management of the student bookstore. As a result, the bookstore, which had been a source of revenue for student activities, was forced to shut down.</P>
<P>Upon learning of the situation, a group of parents volunteered to contribute the services that had formerly been provided by the aforesaid district employee. When the bookstore reopened with parent volunteers, however, the union representing the support personnel filed unfair labor practice charges against the district for utilizing the contributed services. The charge was that the district had contracted out unit work without first bargaining on it to impasse with the union. Among the arguments made in its defense, the district pointed out that by the time the bargaining and the impasse procedures were exhausted and the district was free to act unilaterally, it expected to have sufficient funds to rehire the bookstore clerk. The district&#146;s argument was to no avail; a hearing officer upheld the union&#146;s charges, thereby preventing the district from utilizing contributed help from the parents in operating the bookstore (<I>California School Employees Association</I><I><U> </U></I><I>and its South Lake Tahoe Chapter </I><I>No. 286 v. Lake Tahoe Unified School District, </I>1983).</P>
<P>The NEA&#146;s approach to professional ethics reflects its union orientation to ethical issues. Prior to its becoming a union, the NEA had a code of professional ethics, but it was largely a collection of platitudes (Lieberman, 1956). The items deemed &#147;unethical&#148; included such conduct as breaking one&#146;s contract to accept a better job in another district. Not only was the role of the school employer ignored but specific items in the code frequently revealed a management orientation. In the 1960s the NEA tried to draft and enforce a more meaningful code of ethics. This effort could not overcome the basic problems. First, NEA members did not want to accept any serious restrictions on their activities, and second, the practical problems of having the union exercise a role as prosecutor and judge with respect to members who have paid for defensive purposes, were insuperable.</P>
<P>Essentially the code underwent still another metamorphosis in 1975. Actions that weaken union discipline and unity, such as &#147;preventing the practice of the profession by unqualified persons,&#148; became a focal point of unethical conduct (<I>NEA Handbook, 1993-1994</I>). Essentially, this is where the matter stands; to satisfy the popular view that professionals have a code of ethics, the NEA has one, but the code is little more than a rhetorical gesture to maintain the image of professional status.</P>
<P>Guarantees of minority participation</P>
<P>The resolution on merger talks adopted by the NEA provides that &#147;any organization that is proposed shall guarantee minority group participation in the governance and operation of said organization.&#148; In contrast, the AFT&#146;s constitution includes no such provision. As a matter of fact, during the time the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) was affiliated with both the NEA and AFT, it tried to eliminate the minority guarantees from the NEA constitution. Its failure to achieve this objective was instrumental in its withdrawal from the NEA.</P>
<P>Insofar as we know, the NEA has embraced ethnic quotas more extensively than any other major organization in the United States. Some of the relevant provisions in the NEA&#146;s constitution and bylaws are as follows:</P>
<P>&#149;  All appointive bodies of the Association except the Review Board  shall be designated by the term committee. There shall be a minimum of twenty (20) percent ethnic-minority representation on each  committee . . .</P>
<P>&#149;  If after any period of eleven (11) consecutive membership years a  member of an ethnic-minority group has not served as President, the Association shall take steps as may be legally permissible to elect a member of an ethnic-minority group . . .</P>
<P>&#149;  Members from ethnic minorities shall comprise at least twenty (20)  percent of the Board. The Representative Assembly shall elect addi tional directors as appropriate to assure such ethnic-minority representation on the Board . . .</P>
<P>&#149;  Members from ethnic minorities shall comprise at least twenty (20)  percent of the Executive Committee. The Representative Assembly shall elect additional Executive Committee members as appropriate   to assure such ethnic-minority representation . . .</P>
<P>&#149;  Affiliates of the Association shall take all reasonable and legally per missible steps to achieve on their elective and appointive bodies  ethnic-minority representation that is at least proportional to the  ethnic-minority membership of the affiliate . . .</P>
<P>&#149;  Each affiliate shall apply the one-person-one-vote principle for representation on its government bodies except that the affiliate shalltake  such steps as are legally permissible to achieve ethnic-minority  rep- resentation at least proportionate to its ethnic-minority membership . . . </P>
<P>&#149;  The Association shall, as vacancies arise, employ at all levels of serv ice at least the same ratio of any ethnic minority as is the ethnic  minority to the total population of the United States . . .</P>
<P>&#149;  Ethnic minority shall mean those persons designated as ethnic mi nority by statistics published by the United States Bureau of the  Census. This designation shall specifically include Black, Mexican- American(Chicano),otherSpanish-speakinggroups,Asian-American, and Indian (NEA Constitution, Bylaws 1993).</P>
<P>In contrast, minority participation in AFT affairs is resolved politically, not by constitutional provisions. Even without any governance provisions on the issue, the 40-member AFT Executive Council includes a significant proportion of black members. Many if not all will oppose the guarantees in the NEA governance structure. The minorities in the NEA are more likely to support them or split sharply on the issue. NEA leadership may find itself in a quandary if there is significant minority opposition to eliminating the quotas. In that case, a vote to eliminate them runs the risk of alienating minority support within the NEA.</P>
<P>Note that both the Democratic and Republican parties professed to oppose quotas during the debate over the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The main issue in the debate was whether the proposed legislation would have led to quotas even though it did not explicitly require or authorize them. President Bush and the Republicans in Congress insisted that the legislation was a &#147;quota bill&#148;; the Democrats denied that the legislation would have this effect. Thus the argument was not over the undesirability of quotas but whether the legislation would lead to them.</P>
<P>In the instant case, however, ethnic quotas are clearly mandated by the NEA&#146;s constitution and bylaws. As a matter of fact, one can easily visualize a situation in which the NEA convention has to grapple with such questions as &#147;Who is black?&#148; or &#147;Who is a Native American?&#148; Suppose, for example, a candidate with one black grandparent is elected to the NEA presidency. Would the election of such person fulfill the language and intent of the NEA&#146;s constitutional provision requiring that &#147;legally permissible&#148; steps be taken &#147;to elect a member of an ethnic-minority group&#148;? The prospect of an organization representing millions of teachers having to debate and resolve such issues seems appalling, but it has not been considered by the NEA or its state and local affiliates.</P>
<P>The NEA&#146;s vulnerability on the minority guarantees is rather obvious. Aren&#146;t NEA delegates able or willing to evaluate candidates on the basis of qualifications, not ethnicity? Why the concern over ethnic but not religious or other kinds of invidious discrimination? Is the NEA prepared to decide who is black, Hispanic, Asian-American, whatever, if someone challenges a nomination or an election outcome on the basis that individuals of mixed ancestry have not been categorized properly? And so on. The merger problem is not whether to get rid of the minority guarantees; 
<BR>it is how to eliminate them without appearing to be making a major concession to the AFT on what is supposed to be a nonnegotiable NEA position.</P>
<P>Inasmuch as the case for eliminating the guarantees is even stronger now than in the 1970s, it is difficult to see how the AFT can compromise on the issue. Strategically, it has no reason to do so; the NEA will face a media disaster unless it finds a way to eliminate the guarantees.</P>
<P>Aside from legal action, which would be greatly embarrassing to the NEA regardless of the outcome, the parties might simply agree to sunset any existing minority guarantees. The AFT would be foolish to concede more, since the NEA&#146;s ethnic quotas are likely to evoke widespread criticism and dismay when they are widely publicized outside the union. Perhaps even more important, AFT President Albert Shanker has expressed strong opposition to the quotas, and he would lose a great deal of external support and prestige by compromising on the issue.</P>

<B> The secret ballot issue</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>In authorizing merger talks, the NEA required that any merged organization that is proposed include &#147;the use of the secret ballot to elect the officers and change the governance documents of said organization.&#148; This position differs from the AFT&#146;s.</P>
<P>Both the NEA and AFT are subject to the Landrum-Griffin Act, a federal statute that regulates the conduct of unions in the private sector. However, inasmuch as both NEA and AFT have organized some private sector employees, they are subject to the provisions of the Landrum-Griffin Act; most of their state and local affiliates are not.</P>
<P>The Landrum-Griffin election provisions require that national unions follow one of two procedures regarding the election of delegates to union conventions. If delegates to union conventions are elected by secret ballot, voting at the conventions can be by open ballot. If delegates to conventions are not elected by secret ballot, their votes at union conventions must be by secret ballot (U.S. Dept. of Labor, 1990).</P>
<P>Both the NEA and AFT require that delegates to their national convention shall be elected by secret ballot. In addition, Article VI 1(a) of the NEA Constitution provides that &#147;The executive officers and the six (6) members of the Executive Committee shall be nominated and elected at large by the Representative Assembly by majority vote and by secret ballot for each individual office.&#148;</P>
<P>There is hardly any mystery why the AFT is opposed to the secret ballot at AFT conventions. After gaining bargaining rights in New York City, the United Federation of Teachers enrolled about one-third of AFT membership. Because it was practically impossible to be elected to AFT office without UFT support, the UFT preferred open voting at AFT conventions. Under open voting, it was impossible for candidates to renege on their commitments or to conceal a vote that displeased the leadership of the UFT. The use of the secret ballot in UFT elections to choose delegates to AFT conventions posed no problem for UFT officers and leaders. They controlled union publications and meetings and could otherwise render it all but impossible for dissident candidates to oust them in secret ballot elections. Thus the open ballot ensured control of the AFT by the UFT, led by Albert Shanker, its president. Although the UFT now constitutes a lower percentage of all AFT members, it is practically impossible to deviate broadly from the positions of Shanker&#146;s caucus and be elected to AFT office. This situation led some NEA leaders to fear a similar outcome if the secret ballot for NEA officers at the convention is dropped in the merger agreement. It is difficult to say precisely what impact this could have politically in NEA/AFT; it is possible that a Shanker led caucus might gain more at the local level than it would lose at the convention level. In a large diverse merged organization, there will be considerable pressure to have a voting procedure that enables influential leaders to monitor any deals they make. In any event, although it meets federal requirements, the NEA position is likely to be dropped in any merger agreement. One reason is that even in the NEA, the use of the secret ballot at the convention is restricted to the election of officers and to constitutional amendments. Furthermore, there is an accountability problem with the secret ballot on convention issues. Imagine trying to hold a member of Congress accountable if his/her vote on constitutional amendments was by secret ballot. Or suppose that the vote for Speaker of the House of Representatives was by secret ballot. Everyone recognizes that elected representatives are not entitled to a secret ballot, if they are to be accountable to their electorate.</P>
<P>Although the secret ballot issue had not been resolved in the merger talks by early 1994, open voting at the convention of the merged organization appears to be the most likely outcome. Undoubtedly, delegates sometimes vote differently, depending on whether the vote is public or secret. Delegates may cut deals that would displease their constituents; this is much more likely to happen under a secret ballot. To be sure, a secret ballot also enables delegates to stand on principle when doing so would be politically risky. On balance, however, the secret ballot is much more likely 
<BR>to be abused than it is to be used to support principled but unpopular positions.</P>

<B> Staff vs. membership control</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The NEA and AFT differ in their approaches to membership control. The NEA and its state affiliates have adopted term limits for Association officers. As of early 1994, the NEA limited its executive officers and executive committee to two three-year terms. At the same time, the state associations affiliated with the NEA typically imposed term limits on their elected offi-cers; the latter are usually elected for one or two terms of one or two years and then supposedly return to their regular positions. Some state officers use their term of office to line up an organizational position but the ideal is supposed to be a return to the classroom. To provide continuity, the state associations employ an executive secretary or executive director who is nominally subordinate to the elected officers.</P>
<P>In contrast, the AFT, like most unions, provides for the election of full-time officers who can run for reelection as often as they wish. Albert Shanker has been AFT president since 1974, and many members of the AFT Executive Council have held that office for a decade or more.</P>
<P>The widespread belief in the NEA is that its structure maximizes membership control over staff, whereas the AFT structure supposedly weakens it. This belief was evident in the opposition to the merger talks at the 1993 convention. Although widely held, there is little evidence to support the belief, and there is a great deal of evidence to contradict it. In the past at least, the executive secretaries in the NEA structure have been every bit as dominant and as long lasting as union officers who are reelected for several terms of office.</P>
<P>In recent years, the executive secretaries have lost some of their power in the state associations. One reason is the erosion of term limits on the elected officers. Obviously, the longer elected officers can remain in office, the less influence is exercised by staff members.</P>
<P>Suppose a teacher is elected president of a state association for a one-year term. In many cases, the teacher does not even move to the state capital where the state association is located. The failure to be present on a daily basis obviously weakens the teacher/president&#146;s day to day control. If the teacher moves to the association headquarters, the teacher must also move back, a time-consuming process in a one or two year span. The teacher is usually inundated with a host of ceremonial duties, and his or her executive assistants, if any, owe their primary allegiance to the executive secretary, who will be present long after the teacher/president has left the scene.</P>
<P>It is practically impossible for such rotating presidents to conduct a sustained effort to achieve a policy objective; each president adopts a new theme on taking office or running for office, and the previous one is shunted aside, just as the incumbents will be in the future. Understandably, officers elected this way become heavily dependent on the staff they are supposed to direct and control.</P>
<P>This is not so true of the national NEA as it was when NEA officers were elected annually for one year terms. From 1976 to 1983, NEA presidents were limited to two two-year terms and from 1984 to 1990, to three two-year terms, and since 1991, to two three-year terms. With the increasing longevity of the elected officers, the position of Executive Secretary, now Executive Director, has receded in importance although it is still a very important one. By and large, the state associations affiliated with the NEA have also been moving to longer and more frequent terms of office for elected leaders.</P>
<P>In or out of education, there is no evidence that the NEA structure results in greater membership control. After all, when the elected officials come through a revolving door, it is virtually impossible for them to develop a sustained effort to achieve any substantive objective. The media and politicians prefer to deal with the executive secretaries, who are here today and will be here tomorrow. At the same time, the elective offices tend to be honorific positions handed out more to reward or honor activists than to move the association&#146;s program forward.</P>
<P>This is not to say that there is much membership control under either structure. Under both structures the idea of membership control is hazy to begin with. What are the criteria by which one measures it? What data demonstrates the superiority of the revolving officer structure? In practice, the issue is debated in vague generalities from which partisans on both sides draw whatever conclusions they wish. It is hardly open to dispute, however, that in most organizations with annual or biannual term limits, the executive secretaries and association staff tend to dominate or overshadow the elected officers.</P>

<B> The status of support personnel</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>According to an AFT brochure published in January 1993:</P>
<P><I>For years, NEA prided itself as an elite professional association and deliberately excluded non-teaching </I><I>school employees from its membership. Anyone who wasn&#146;t a classroom teacher or a school </I><I>administrator was considered a &#147;non-professional&#148; and unworthy of membership. Faced with a </I><I>declining teacher membership in the 1970s, due to layoffs and the growth of the AFT, the NEA </I><I>finally began to accept some categories of school employees as limited members.</I></P>
<P><I> </I><I> </I><I>NEA has a long history of disrespect and discrimination against its school employee members. NEA </I><I>treated its school employee members as second-class citizens by not allowing them the right to vote in </I><I>NEA elections or on NEA policy, or to hold NEA office </I><I>until</I><I> 1980. (NEA teachers, administrators, </I><I>student members and </I><I>even</I><I> retired members had long enjoyed these basic union rights.) (AFT, 1993).</I></P>
<P>The AFT brochure then goes on to assert that the Federation has always offered support personnel full membership rights but that the NEA did so only under legal duress. The brochure alleges that as of September 1989:</P>
<P>1. State associations (Georgia, North Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee) took dues from support personnel but did not allow them to vote or hold union office.</P>
<P>2. State associations in Alabama, Indiana, Iowa, Rhode Island, West Virginia sell services to organizations of support personnel in order to avoid having support personnel participate in the affairs of the teacher union.</P>
<P>3. State associations in California, Nevada, Nebraska, provide publications but no bargaining, legal, or insurance services for support personnel.</P>
<P>4. State associations in Minnesota and Utah do not allow membership to support personnel (AFT, 1989).</P>
<P>Inasmuch as the AFT brochure refers to conditions existing in 1989, the conditions referred to probably have been changed in at least some states. Otherwise, the AFT would not have referred to them in the past tense. Even so, the policies of the NEA and AFT are not fully consistent with respect to organizing support personnel. It is very doubtful that the AFT would accept a state option that might weaken the rights of its 100,000 or more school related personnel. Such an option in the merger agreement would risk defections by support personnel to other unions or to the independent associations of support personnel.</P>
<P>The history of the relationships between teachers and support personnel sheds some light on the organizational differences. The large cities organized by the AFT tended to have heavier concentrations of paraprofessionals. Indeed, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the AFT and AFSCME were competing for bargaining rights for paraprofessionals in New York City. The United Federation of Teachers offered AFSCME jurisdiction over school related personnel outside the classroom while the AFT would or-ganize the educational workers inside of them. Most of the paraprofessionals in the New York City schools were blacks. Anticipating black resentment against the UFT over its strike against the dismissal of white teachers and administrators by predominantly black community boards of education, AFSCME rejected the offer but the UFT won the representation election. Within the UFT, there was some resentment against the inclusion of the paraprofessionals in the UFT but Shanker&#146;s views on the issue prevailed.</P>
<P>At that time, most NEA affiliates showed little interest in organizing school related personnel. Consequently, the AFT established a large beachhead on this front. Over time, state and local affiliates of the NEA came to accept, or at least to tolerate, the inclusion of school related personnel in their organizations.</P>
<P>It is likely that merger will provide for little or no restriction on the inclusion of school related personnel; we expect a vigorous effort by NEA/AFT to organize them in every state where such workers are not already in the NEA or AFT. The upshot will be a vast industrial union, that is, a union that includes all the skills and crafts within a single school district. There may be some holdouts in the NEA, but it is difficult to see how they can prevail. The AFT cannot accept less than it now provides support personnel; to do so would risk their defection to a different union or association of support personnel. AFT rhetoric criticizes the alleged second class citizenship of support employees in the NEA and charges that the NEA continues to organize such personnel only because of declines in teacher members and dues revenues. Perhaps, but AFT leaders are also aware of the potential revenues and political influence provided by the inclusion of school related personnel.</P>

<B> The NEA&#146;s tax exemption</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The NEA is one of a small group of nonprofit organizations, such as the American Legion and the American Red Cross, that are chartered by Congress. The NEA&#146;s charter exempts its property in the District of Columbia from federal taxation provided that the exemption &#147;not apply to any property which . . . shall not be applied to the educational purpose of the corporation.&#148;</P>
<P>Unquestionably, the 1907 Congress would not have exempted the 1993 NEA&#146;s property from federal taxation. The NEA that was chartered by Congress in 1907 was an organization devoted to disseminating information about education; as the AFT has pointed out, the NEA&#146;s union role and lobbying activities violate both the spirit and intent of the purposes under which the tax exemption was granted. In 1978, the Internal Revenue Service reclassified the NEA from a &#147;professional association&#148; to a labor union; and in 1979, a federal court held that the NEA was a labor union subject to the Landrum-Griffin Act. Nevertheless, when the AFT subsequently questioned the continuation of the NEA&#146;s tax exempt status, the Director of Finance for the District of Columbia astonishingly asserted that &#147;the activities of the organization and the use made of the property is consistent with the purposes and objects provided in their Articles of Incorporation.&#148;</P>
<P>What is especially interesting here is that under President Albert Shanker, the AFT sought to remove the exemption but in a way that did not leave AFT&#146;s fingerprints on the action. Indeed, on this issue, the AFT was willing to work with &#147;right wing&#148; forces that both the NEA and AFT normally condemn for their alleged hostility to public education and to teacher unions.</P>
<P>Will the AFT merger team now try to persuade the NEA to forego its tax exemption? In view of the probability that the AFT will benefit from the exemption, this is not very likely. Clearly the NEA has protected its exemption from District of Columbia taxes; although District of Columbia officials take a benign view of the issue, District taxpayers may see it differently. Ironically, both unions have expressed opposition to tax exemptions that adversely affect school revenues, as is certainly the case regarding the NEA&#146;s exemption.</P>
<P>The tax exemption is not the most important merger issue, but it illustrates how little the public or the rank and file members of the NEA and AFT understand what is at stake in the merger talks. The question of who has the authority to remove the tax exemption is a complex one. As the AFT recognized, it would not be necessary to change or revoke the NEA&#146;s Charter to eliminate the exemption. Probably, it would only be necessary to have the appropriate District of Columbia officials rule that the NEA was not in conformity with the conditions under which the exemption was granted. Legally, Congress could change or revoke the charter, but in view of NEA&#146;s influence in Congress, Congressional action to eliminate the exemption is extremely improbable. The NEA undoubtedly has considerable influence among the District of Columbia officials as well as among Congress, but at least the District would benefit from eliminating the exemption.</P>

<B> Merger and organizational differences: Concluding observations</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>As emphasized at the outset, the organizational issues that have surfaced will not necessarily be the most difficult to resolve. Furthermore, many agreements might be unacceptable in isolation but acceptable as part of a comprehensive package. As of early 1994, the NEA and AFT teams holding the merger talks seemed to be making good progress, but very little about the specifics has been made available for rank and file or media consumption. The NEA&#146;s Representative Assembly placed so much emphasis on being informed about the progress of the merger talks that it may be difficult, especially for the NEA team, to continue in this mode before the talks have concluded. Until that time, however, the resolution of specific differences must take into account the possibility that any agreements may be modified by others not yet reached or announced. Similarly, any conclusions about the merger should be based on an analysis of the entire merger agreement. We surmise that, as in most situations of this nature, the career interests of leading parties to the merger will play a significant role in its provisions, but the specifics may not be known for years to come, if they become known at all.</P>

<P>The merger of the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers&#150;AFL-CIO, would be the capstone of the shift from a predominantly private to a predominantly public sector union movement. Public employee unionism has moved from back to center stage in union affairs, as the balance of power within the union movement has shifted steadily from the private to the public sector unions. Because of its magnitude and because professional employees are involved, the NEA/AFT merger would be a climactic step in this historic transformation. The NEA is already the largest union in North America, and perhaps the world. The merged teacher union would surge to a membership never before attained by a union anywhere. It would be the Goliath of labor. On an average annual full-time dues-paying basis, its combined membership would range from about 2.5 to 2.7 million members in the short run, and perhaps an additional million or more in five to ten years.</P>
<P>The NEA/AFT&#146;s massive size alone would command attention. But when coupled with the policies it is certain to support, the merger becomes even more important for organized labor and for the American economy and society. The new center of gravity in the labor movement will further reorient what unions do and why. For one thing, it will highlight the transformation of unionism in the United States that began three decades ago.</P>
<P>From the establishment of the American Federation of Labor in 1886 to the 1960s, the union movement had been composed primarily of private sector workers. Most organized labor in the public sector was in federal employment and consisted primarily of postal employees. What we know today as the NEA was founded by school superintendents in 1857, nearly three decades before the founding of the AFL. Initially known as the National Teachers Association (NTA), it eventually changed its name to the National Education Association of the United States in 1907. Early on, the NEA shared one basic interest with organized labor. The latter tried for many years to avoid competition from firms that employed child labor. Eventually, the labor unions successfully lobbied Congress into enacting legislation that prohibited interstate commerce in goods made with child labor; shortly thereafter, however, the legislation was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. Forced to find another way to prohibit child labor, the labor movement found it in the compulsory education statutes. On this issue of crucial importance to both groups, the interests of the labor movement and the public school establishment were mutually supportive. However, on other issues the NEA often adopted a different and often hostile attitude toward unionism.</P>
<P>Despite its initial opposition to collective bargaining, the NEA eventually embraced it wholeheartedly in the late 1960s and thereafter. Since that time, the union movement has been moving dramatically to a public sector orientation. In the early 1950s public sector unions comprised a mere 6 percent of total union membership; by 1994, labor organizations of government employees constituted more than 40 percent of total union membership. The NEA/AFT will be at the head of this transformed union movement.</P>
<P>In labor history, this transformation ranks in importance with the emergence of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the 1930s, and the founding of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1886. Each marks a watershed in the development of the union movement. Although the AFL founded what is now the AFL-CIO, the establishment of the CIO marked the unionization of large-scale manufacturing and led to a fundamental change in private sector unionism. Prior to its merger with the AFL, the CIO had been dominated by the United Auto Workers (UAW), and the United Steelworkers (USW), and for most of its organizational life, the leaders of the CIO came from these two unions.</P>
<P>Until the rise of the CIO, most unionized private sector workers were blue collar, skilled workers in nonmanufacturing industries. The CIO changed that balance, but the private sector union movement remained essentially a blue collar movement. Unlike previous upsurges in labor or-ganization, the emergence of public sector unionism changed the occupational and the industrial character of organized labor as never before.</P>
<P>The public sector unions brought large numbers of white collar workers into the labor movement for the first time. In contrast, neither the AFL nor the CIO separately, nor as a merged federation, had been able to organ-ize the white collar occupations in the private economy. And to this day, they remain outside the union fold. The same pattern&#151;extensive unionism among public white collar employees and nonunionism among private white collar employees&#151;characterizes all other major industrial economies, albeit the percentage of private white collar workers unionized abroad is somewhat higher than in the United States.</P>
<P>Except for Canada among industrial countries, the United States has lagged in the unionization of government employees. In recent years, however, Canadian and public sector unions, aided and abetted by public policy far more pro-union than in the United States, have surpassed the U.S. lead in the unionization of government employees. As the U.S. and Canadian economies grow closer, the higher union penetration in Canada has attracted the attention of U.S. policy makers. Several have suggested that the Canadian experience should be a model for U.S. industrial relations. U.S. trends are already headed where the Canadians have already gone, so the Canadian model appeals to the conventional pro-union outlook. Indeed, since the Supreme Court&#146;s 1985 decision in <I>Garcia</I>, Congress has had the constitutional authority to enact labor law covering state and local employees (<I>Garcia v. </I><I>San Antonio Metropolitan</I> <I>Transit Authority</I>, <I>et</I>.<I>al</I>., 1985). If that were to happen, the public sector union movement would expand, and NEA/AFT would become increasingly important.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the 20th century, public sector labor organizations comprised fewer than 2 percent of all organized groups of employees; early in the 21st century however, public sector unionism, even in the absence of Congressional legislation governing state and local labor relations, will be dominant in labor membership. Abroad, labor movements in Canada, Britain (the ancestral home of unionism), France, and Italy are already composed primarily of public employees. If the 20th century was the century of private sector unionism, the 21st will be the century of public sector unionism in the United States and in the Atlantic community nations generally.</P>

<B> Origins of public sector unionism</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>Despite the historic rivalry between the NEA and AFT, they share some common as well as dissimilar roots. Even their intense competition over representation rights, especially in the 1960s, was driven by the same factors. Prior to the onset of full-scale public unionism, numerous professional and civil service associations represented public employees before legislative and executive bodies. We refer to organizations that could not negotiate and strike as &#147;proto-unions.&#148; Indeed, it was the presence of these associations like the NEA, and proto-unions like the AFT, which enabled public sector labor organization to emerge in the 1960s on a large scale and with so little of the social conflict which characterized the formative years of private sector unionism. Many proto-unions were affiliates of the AFL or CIO, either before or after their merger in 1955. In general, their labor market behavior resembled that of the professional associations like the NEA and the public employee associations prior to the 1960s.</P>
<P>In his classic study of public sector unions, Spero noted the distinction between proto-unions and private sector unions:</P>
<P><I>Organized labor itself has not always fully accepted the public worker. To a large extent the feeling on </I><I>both sides is the result of the restrictions which government as an employer places upon the freedom </I><I>of its employees to engage in political activity and strike. These restrictions mean that public </I><I>employees are able to go along with fellow workers in industry only up to a certain point</I><I> </I><I>.</I><I> </I><I>.</I><I> </I><I>. Time </I><I>and again government employee unions have had to abstain from voting on political actions in which all </I><I>other unions took part (Spero, 1972).</I></P>
<P>Likewise, when it came to collective bargaining, Spero commented that &#147;although unions in private industry have always regarded collective bargaining as the life blood of a free labor movement, unions in the public service have only recently [circa 1948] begun to show interest in the proc-ess&#148; (Spero, 1972). While a few public sector labor organizations had taken some steps toward becoming unions during the years between the end of World War II and the 1960s, they were still far from full-scale unionism (Spero, 1972, Krislov, 1962).</P>
<P>Professional associations like the NEA and proto-unions like the AFT opposed strikes and overt collective bargaining. At one time, the AFT even opposed teacher strikes as a matter of policy. Local teacher organizations occasionally went on strike, but the number was small and the duration brief. For example, in 1946, a record high strike year in the private sector because of the post-war readjustments to inflation,.0034 percent of municipal work time was lost compared to 1.5 percent in the private sector (Spero, 1972). Ziskind&#146;s count of over one thousand strikes in public employment, from the end of the 19th century into the New Deal years, included 30 percent which lasted a day or less, suggesting that they should have been classified as protests, not strikes (Ziskind, 1940). In addition to the proto-unions&#146; disapproval of the strike, public opinion at the time as well as public policy and the leadership of the nation also opposed strikes by public workers. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the president most supportive of unionism, opposed strikes by public employees and even opposed their right to organize into unions. When the National Labor Relations Act was enacted in 1935, federal employees (who could have been included) were excluded from its jurisdiction. By all the major indicators, the pre-1960s organizations of public employees were much less union oriented than the contemporary organizations that carry the same name.</P>
<P>The most dramatic examples of their transformation to union status were the National Education Association, and the American Federation of Teachers:</P>
<P><I>The dramatic shift in image from the milquetoast-like teacher to the militant unionist which has </I><I>accompanied the adoption of collective bargaining procedures by teachers at all levels of instruction is </I><I>one of the well-publicized developments in public-sector labor relations (Stern, 1988).</I></P>
<P>In the 1960s the NEA was forced to choose between unionization and diminution if not extinction. After intense internal conflict, it chose unionization. In the process, the NEA and the AFT became indistinguishable from each other (Stern, 1988), a factor which facilitates their merger. In this connection, the fact that the teacher unions are predominantly female should not be construed as an indication of unwillingness to be militant. The record of teacher strikes and job actions indicates otherwise.</P>
<P>For the NEA the transformation was simplified because it had the appropriate organizational profile for conversion to unionism. As Krislov concluded from his study of associations, independent associations had organ-ized a significant number of employees, their structure and governance were similar to unions, and they engaged in membership recruitment and lobbying just as unions always have (Krislov, 1962). For proto-unions like the AFT, the conversion was even easier. The AFT was originally cast in the mold of conventional private sector unions. The Federation, an affiliate of the AFL since its founding in 1916, historically regarded itself both as a union and a professional association, and only renounced the right to strike briefly in the 1950s (Lieberman and Moskow, 1966).</P>
<P>The evolution of the contemporary public sector union movement was a unique development in union history. Its most distinguishing feature was the organization of the organized. In contrast, the history of private unionism is devoted to the organization of the unorganized. Moreover, the rise and spread of public sector unionism far outpaced the development of either the AFL or the CIO or any of their principal affiliates.</P>
<P>The absence of strong opposition to public sector unions has given them an optimistic outlook for the future. Insofar as that outlook is based on a growing labor market largely protected from competitive forces, it is justified. Public sector unionism&#146;s viability contrasts sharply with the vulnerability of private sector unionism. Manufacturing and private sector unionism as a whole are vulnerable to market forces and economic changes. Private sector unionism peaked as a percentage of employment in 1953 (at 36 percent), coincident with the birth of the service dominated labor market. Pounded by other market forces as well, private sector unionism is declining to 10 percent of the private sector working population, a figure below its 1929 market share. Its membership peaked at 17 million in 1970 and is now less than 10 million.</P>
<P>In sharp contrast, public sector unionism currently stands at or near record highs in both membership and market share. Indeed, public sector unions enroll more members (now approaching 7 million) than the CIO ever did, and their 40 percent share of the public labor market is higher than 
<BR>was ever reached by private sector unions. Moreover, public sector unions have expanded throughout all levels of government. Because of the 
<BR>teacher unions and the postal service organizations, public sector unions are spread more broadly across the country than private sector unions ever were.</P>
<P>Except for the railways, unionism among teachers is far more widespread than it is among any group of private sector employees; in government, teacher unions lag only behind the postal service (which is about 95 percent unionized), and fire fighters. The most recent census of governments (1987) reports that 61 percent of public school instructional staff employed full time were organized. Significantly, 88 percent of all township teaching staff, a small size unit, were organized. This is a remarkable contrast to the low union penetration rate among small size private employers. Among school districts, 59 percent of the teachers were organized (Bureau of Census, 1987). The high union penetration in railroad employment (around 85 to 90 percent) underscores the critical impact of government regulation on union organization over a long period of time. Like the high level of organization in the postal service, the level of organization in the railroad industry also suggests where the rest of the public sector may be headed, with the NEA/AFT leading the way.</P>
<P>Further gains in public sector unionization are likely because of future gains in public employment. Between 1980 and 1989, public employment in 40 of the 50 states rose more than population. The average density of public employment for all states showed state employment up 19 percent compared to a population increase of just nine percent during the 1980s. This pattern is likely to continue despite political rhetoric and promises of belt-tightening.</P>
<P>What accounts for the dramatic change in public sector organization between 1900 and 2000 and the likelihood of its future growth? How could public sector unions account for less than two percent of total U.S. union membership in 1900 but enroll more than 40 percent in 1993, well on the way to dominating organized labor by the next century? Public sector unionism&#146;s durability and ascending growth curve are the result of its virtual immunity from competition and government policy, which enhances its monopoly power. Its low unemployment rate is an indicator of its immunity against competition. U.S. Department of Labor statistics show that the unemployment rate of government workers is in the 2 percent range (<I>Employment and Earnings</I>, 1991), while unemployment rates in the private sector more than tripled that rate.</P>
<P>Naturally, the stability of public sector employment increases the relative stability of public compared to private sector unionism in membership, market share, and organizational structure. Few if any public sector unions have folded, whereas large numbers of private sector unions have disappeared over the past 30 years. These facts augur well for the future durability of public sector unionism and reinforce the expectation that it will dominate the labor movement in the next century. Even in the face of real or threatened budget cutbacks, public employment and public sector unions have increased. At most, budget cutbacks translate into a slowdown of the rate of public expenditures, not an absolute reduction; meanwhile, layoffs typically culminate in no reductions of total public employment.</P>
<P>The NEA/AFT&#146;s general invulnerability to competitive forces indicates that the teacher unions will not have to face the problems that have led to the decline of private sector unionism. Because of these problems, Richard Lester postulated in 1958 that the growth curve of private sector unions would level off or drift downward (Lester, 1958). In fact, private unions did peak in 1970 and have declined precipitously since, perhaps more than Lester anticipated, but he was surely on the right track.</P>
<P>While public policy also fortifies the monopoly power of the private sector unions, competitive markets have relentlessly undermined that power. Because the public domain is virtually immune to competition, public policy reinforces the monopoly power of public sector unions.</P>

<B> A merger unique in labor history</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The merged NEA/AFT will be based upon its immunity from competitive market forces and upon previous mergers. Once the professional and public employee associations became unions, mergers (and acquisitions) inevitably followed. The history of labor organization in the private labor market, like that of business enterprise, has been characterized by mergers, but also by dissolutions and disappearances.</P>
<P>Like the life cycle of the industries in which they are established, nearly all private sector unions are in a state of permanent decline. And this has led to numerous mergers, as it became fiscally and organizationally impractical to continue as a free-standing union. Individual unions associated with industries whose life cycle has come and gone share the fate of those industries; this is illustrated by an abbreviated roll call of unions associated with private sector industries that have dwindled or disappeared entirely: Elastic Goring Workers, Carriage Workers, Chandelier Workers, Straw and Ladies Hat Workers, Stogie Makers, Steel Plate Transferrers, Tip Printers, Glass Flatteners, Sheep Shearers, Mule Spinners, Cigar Makers, Broom and Whisk Makers, Tube Workers, Tack Makers, Sawsmiths, Gold Beaters, and Pocket Knife Grinders. Comparable developments in the public labor market are unlikely.</P>
<P>Major contemporary unions, like the United Auto Workers and United Steel Workers, are undergoing a long-term decline, albeit not elimination. Today these once powerful unions are less than one-half their peak size and are still shrinking as their associated industries contract. It would not be surprising to see these two unions merge with others, perhaps with each other before the end of the 1990s. In any case, union mergers in the private sector are typically the product of weakness and decline.</P>
<P>The record of union mergers in the public sector is different. Although there have been mergers and acquisitions for defensive reasons (to avoid raids), or reorganizations stimulated by managerial reorganizations, such as in the postal service, they have not emerged because the membership faced extinction, as in the private labor market. In this light, the NEA/AFT merger will be unique in the annals of unionism&#151;a merger of two unions when both are at their peak in numbers, power and revenues. Theirs is a merger from strength, not weakness, and the merger will further augment their monopoly power.</P>
<P>To be sure, the AFT undertook some program cuts and was forced to raise its dues in 1992 and 1993, but these developments do not appear to reflect any major deterioration in the AFT&#146;s basic constituency. Unlike the NEA, AFT leadership is actively seeking union growth outside the field of education, but the moving force seems to be organizing opportunity, not internal decline. The possibility of internal financial difficulties cannot be ruled out as a factor underlying AFT interest in merger, but as we have seen, its interest in merger long antedated any existing financial problems of the AFT.</P>
<P>At the present time, the NEA and the AFT enroll about four of every ten public sector union members. A merger will strengthen the NEA/AFT leadership position in both the public sector and eventually in the labor movement as a whole. The concentration of membership in the new organ-ization will also facilitate the mobilization of its political and economic powers.</P>
<P>If defense is not the game in an NEA/AFT merger, its strategy and its repercussions must be both precautionary and offensive. In economic terms, the NEA/AFT will seek to tighten its grip on the educational labor market. Public education is now under serious challenge from various modes of privatization. Although only in its earliest phase, the demand for a competitive educational system has picked up enough momentum to force the teacher unions to act in a precautionary manner. Their offensive strategy is, of course, to fend off competitive alternatives by political pressure, and when necessary at the ballot box (Lieberman, 1993).</P>
<P>Eventually, health care unions will follow in the wake of the NEA/AFT. If the Clinton Administration succeeds in expanding the government&#146;s role in health care, another powerful branch of public sector unionism will emerge. However, none of the unions involved, irrespective of merger activity, will rival the new NEA/AFT in monopoly and political power.</P>

<B> Implications of an NEA/AFT merger for the AFL-CIO</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The merger of the NEA and the AFT will have significant implications for the future of the AFL-CIO. The NEA is not now an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, but the merged organization is likely to become fully affiliated over time. Because of its size, NEA/AFT will realign the AFL-CIO power structure. The balance of power within the Federation will shift toward the public sector unions. Affiliation will be followed by a significant change in the role and importance of the Public Employees Department (PED), in the AFL-CIO. The department, established initially to represent the interests of organized public employees, has had a lackluster record. Theoretically, the PED&#146;s organizational status is the same as the Building and Construction Trades and the Industrial Union Departments. The Building Trades Department reflects the occupational basis of the original American Federation of Labor and the Industrial Union Department the industrial base of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Together, they make up the private sector components of the AFL-CIO.</P>
<P>Up to this time, however, the PED has not enjoyed a power position comparable to either the Building and Construction Trades, or the Industrial Union Department of the Federation; moreover, the PED has had little impact on public policy and on public awareness. Under a more activist leadership, and with more public sector members, however, the balance of power within the AFL-CIO would swing toward public sector unionism. Significantly, the PED would outnumber the other two departments, and probably become the stepping stone to the leadership of the AFL-CIO. Early in the 21st century the Federation&#146;s leadership will pass from private to public sector union leaders, and most likely to the leaders of the 
<BR>NEA/AFT.</P>
<P>Doubtless there will be challenges to the NEA/AFT&#146;s leadership of the Federation. There will also be various controversies into which the new union will be drawn; the most important of these will be jurisdictional disputes. Many private sector unions in the AFL-CIO have reacted to their declining numbers by organizing public sector workers, and have tried to incorporate the independent employee associations still representing public employees. These efforts conflict with the established jurisdictional claims of affiliated public employee unions. Although none appear to involve professional teachers or instructional paraprofessionals, other non-instructional staff could be potential organizing targets among several unions within the AFL-CIO. Because they are already making strenuous efforts to organize educational support personnel, NEA/AFT will necessarily be involved in the resolution of such disputes. So long as there is no serious jurisdictional competition over the unorganized public employee, the relationship of public and private union movements in the Federation can be complementary, and will prevent any rupture arising from their jurisdictional differences. We believe however, that the existing jurisdictional free for all, in which several national unions seek to organize support personnel, is not likely to continue indefinitely.</P>
<P>In appearance, the AFL-CIO appears to be a unitary movement. In reality, it is not. The fact that private and public unions are affiliated with the same parent organization does not imply that there are no basic differences between private and public sector unions, or deny the existence of two labor movements with different philosophies. While administratively (and in other respects) a single body, the AFL-CIO today is actually a house divided between private and public unions. However, we do not expect the AFL-CIO to split into two federations, paralleling the split in the AFL and the rise of the CIO in 1937. The cost of such a split in the face of the weakening position of private sector unions and the value of the AFL-CIO label for the public sector unions point to a continuation of the existing structure that combines private and public sector unions. Moreover, the AFL-CIO has shown adaptability at various times in its history. The Federation continues to be dominated by private sector unions, but has already adjusted to the presence of a large body of public employee unions. This adjustment will facilitate any future change in leadership coming from the public sector. Such a change has already occurred in the British union movement, the oldest in the world. As in the United States, most unions in Great Britain, whether public or private, are affiliated with the same umbrella federation, the Trades Union Congress (TUC); the TUC is now dominated by membership from the public sector. Nevertheless, the affiliation of the NEA/AFT with the AFL-CIO will reveal the clash of private and public sector philosophies and policies. Conceivably, the clash could lead to the establishment of a separate federation of public employees, just as the quarrel over jurisdiction (and personal power) led to the withdrawal of unions from the AFL and the formation of the CIO during the 1930s. Certainly, the differences between private and public sector unions are sufficient and at least as important as those which led to the split within the AFL and the rise of the CIO. While the logic is there for two separate federations, the probabilities are negligible, because the union movement as a whole has been on the defensive and because of the negative outcomes of inter-union conflicts in the 1930s; a united front is a historical imperative for organized labor. Furthermore, it is important to remember that the CIO was founded in a period of rising expectations and growth for organized labor in the private labor market. This condition no longer prevails, and the growing weakness of private sector unions will inhibit their leaving the umbrella organization.</P>

<B> Social unionism: The new labor philosophy</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The NEA/AFT is likely to spearhead social unionism, the philosophy of the public sector union movement. Philosophically, the goal of social unionism is to redistribute an increasing share of the national income from the private to the public economy&#151;a substitution of public for individual choice in consumption. Total government spending as a share of the national 
<BR>income has grown steadily since the New Deal. Today it accounts for nearly 45 percent of the national income. (National income is a more relevant measure than gross domestic or gross national product for comparative purposes because it comprises the income which the factors of production receive.) We define this development as the &#147;socialization of income.&#148;</P>
<P>In contrast, the proximate goal of private sector unionism is to redistribute income from employers or consumers to organized workers. While this philosophy, historically identified as &#147;more,&#148; is also followed by public employee unions, their pursuit of &#147;more&#148; <I>requires</I> the redistribution of income from the private to the public economy.</P>
<P>Since education is one of the largest non-defense, social expenditures of government, the NEA/AFT is understandably in the forefront of the movement to redistribute income. At the same time, a fundamental change in the structure of labor markets underscores the basic change in union philosophy; government employment now exceeds employment in manufacturing, the basic private goods industry of the economy.</P>
<P>The line dividing the philosophies of the private and public union movements is the mechanism for allocating resources within the economy: Private sector unions depend <I>primarily on markets for </I><I>allocating resources</I>. Although private sector unions advocate government intervention in markets in several areas, the interventions are generally different from the basic approach of public sector unionism. Private sector unions promote an industrial policy (and therefore opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA), more regulation of labor markets including what is euphemistically termed &#147;labor law reform,&#148; and Keynesian spending policies. In contrast public sector unionism&#146;s philosophy relies <I>primarily on</I><U> </U><I>government to allocate resources and replace market with </I><I>social</I> <I>decisionmaking.</I> While it also opposes NAFTA, it has no economic stake in its opposition, which is based upon labor solidarity.</P>
<P>The two philosophies conflict in many policy areas, such as tax rebates on the middle class, but they are united in their advocacy of more government intervention. For that reason, and for reasons of labor solidarity, the two philosophies co-exist in the AFL-CIO, and will probably continue to co-exist under an NEA/AFT merger.</P>
<P>Significantly, social unionism is not the result of theorists. It is the product of experience, not of ideologues. However, the NEA/AFT will be social unionism&#146;s revolutionary vanguard. The teacher unions will provide a great deal of the intellectual leadership for social unionism, because implementation, as distinguished from conception, requires supporters whose stock in trade are ideas. Politically, the ideological bent of public sector unionism has become increasingly more radical. This surfaces in increased efforts to reduce the authority of local governments (school boards) in shaping educational methods and goals. As evidenced by the all-out effort to defeat Proposition 174 in California, the new Goliath in public education will resist even more fiercely the establishment of competitive private sector education. Indeed, since educational spending is the major outlay of local governments, the birth of a new monopoly in educational services will heighten the overall conflict between advocates of more government versus individual choice in our society.</P>

<B> Policy and political consequences of social unionism</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>While the overall goal of social unionism is increased government intervention in the economy and the redistribution of national income from the private to the public economy, it also has specific objectives and a political agenda as well. Social unionism is the driving force behind the NEA&#146;s commitment to a quota system based on race in staffing its organization. In fact, this is an issue in the merger talks. As noted in Chapter 8, the NEA already is committed to a racially based quota system in the staffing and governance of the Association. Indeed, Myron Lieberman has observed that, &#147;insofar . . . as I know, the NEA has embraced racial quotas more extensively than any other major organization in the United States&#148; (Lieberman, 1993). Unquestionably racial quotas are opposed by AFT leadership, and probably most of its membership as well.</P>
<P>Any application of the NEA&#146;s quota systems to the staffing of public education would constitute a major challenge to an open society. At a time when public education is under attack for failing to deliver quality education, social policies which rely on quotas are likely to further undermine public confidence in education.</P>
<P>Although the leadership of private sector unions has steadfastly endorsed Democrats for the presidency (indeed, were responsible for Mondale&#146;s nomination in 1984), the voting profiles of private and public union members differ. The majority of the private sector union members supported Reagan in 1984, but the overwhelming majority of public sector members voted for Mondale. Combined, approximately 55 percent of union households supported Mondale. As previously noted, NEA and AFT members accounted for 10 percent of the delegates at the 1992 Democratic Convention who nominated Bill Clinton for the presidency.</P>
<P>One of social unionism&#146;s most serious political and fiscal consequences is its tendency to skew public priorities in favor of the services provided by strong public sector unions. In fact, the increasing incidence of local governmental deficits and bankruptcies result in large part from public sector bargaining; the rising incidence of municipal insolvencies is a telling indicator of union encroachment on the fiscal stability and the sovereignty of local government (Spiotto, 1991). Currently, the power of the public sector unions to influence the size and distribution of public revenues lies at the heart of the sovereignty issue. While union power to maximize the demand for their services has been recognized, its power to weaken sovereignty with its consequences for deficits and bankruptcies has not.</P>
<P>Government is a labor intensive industry, so personnel costs are a major fraction of its total costs. These costs range from 60 to 75 percent of municipal budgets (Spiotto, 1991). Public sector unions have pushed up wages and fringe benefits, probably far more than statisticians have reported (Freeman, 1986). Wages in the public sector are less subject to competitive forces, and capital-for-labor substitution is more difficult than in the private sector. These factors make it difficult for local governments to limit wage increases and have contributed to their precarious fiscal status, even their insolvency in some situations.</P>
<P>New York City&#146;s <I>de facto</I> bankruptcy illustrates how social unionism can weaken the sovereignty of local governments. The City of New York went bankrupt in 1975 when it was unable to market its debt. Municipal officials decided that legal bankruptcy had to be avoided because under the bankruptcy laws, a proposed plan of adjustment had to show that 51 percent of the debt had been accepted by creditors. Since it was manifestly very difficult, if not impossible, to gain acceptance of a reorganization plan because of the dispersion of the debt among 160,000 creditors, an alternative to the Bankruptcy Court had to be devised (Spiotto, 1991). In addition to the administrative problems, the avoidance of bankruptcy was also a high political priority since the political costs of municipal bankruptcy would have been disastrous.</P>
<P>The municipal unions, including the United Federation of Teachers, were among the major contributors to the city&#146;s fiscal debacle. Although there is little if any dispute about this, two analysts of the city&#146;s financial debacle could not muster the courage to identify the unions&#146; role. Instead, they euphemistically identified only &#147;groups&#148; to whom &#147;New York&#146;s elected officials . . . found it difficult to say no&#148; and from whom they could not obtain a &#147;<I>quid pro quo</I>&#148; (Spiotto, 1991 and 1993). In their explanation of the city&#146;s financial difficulties, these analysts never identified the &#147;groups&#148; to whom the city could not say &#147;No&#148; and from whom they could not demand a &#147;<I>quid pro quo</I>.&#148; Since the word &#147;union&#148; never appears in their analysis of New York City&#146;s fiscal crisis, a visitor from outer space would think that New York was a nonunion city and could only speculate on the identity of these mysterious &#147;groups.&#148; Nevertheless, the unions were clearly among the leading &#147;groups&#148; to whom the politicians could not say &#147;No,&#148; and from whom increased productivity failed to materialize despite repeated assurances to the electorate. As the November 1993 election demonstrated, the theme of increased productivity from city employees remains an enduring element in New York City politics, with the city&#146;s public sector unions gearing up to oppose efforts by newly elected Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to contract out some municipal services as a cost containment measure.</P>
<P>As the New York City situation illustrates, the consequences of social unionism for the economy and for local government are significant. Most importantly, an NEA/AFT merger will give added political impetus for an ongoing redistribution of the national income from the private to the public economy. In all likelihood, a merger of the NEA and the AFT would be the most important development in labor relations in the 1990s. With the merger, public sector unionism will become the new center of gravity of the labor movement. Educational policy will surely become more subject to collective bargaining, hence more subject to union influence at both the legislative level and in collective bargaining.</P>

<P>Although much remains to be said about the past and present of teacher unions, we conclude our analysis with some comments about their future. Obviously, the possibility of an NEA/AFT merger is critical to their future. We believe that the unions will merge, hence we devote some attention to the implications of merger uncertain as it may be. Our discussion will also address the possibility of an alternative teacher organization and the concerns of various parties who oppose the growing influence of the teacher unions.</P>
<P>Whether or not merger materializes, we can expect a lengthy period of NEA/AFT cooperation and avoidance of actions that would jeopardize merger in the future. In some cases, the developments we anticipate under merger may also take place under a cooperative relationship that falls short of merger. We are confident however, that readers who have followed our analysis to this point will be able to distinguish the future developments that are dependent on merger from those that are not.</P>
<P>An NEA/AFT merger will affect education at the local, state and federal levels, but in different ways and at different times. As far as membership is concerned, merger represents a pooling of forces, but the pooling will occur more at the state and federal than at the local level. The reason is that one or the other union has organized most if not all of the teachers in any given school district; there are not many NEA members in districts where an AFT affiliate is the bargaining agent and vice versa. As previously pointed out, the tendency for membership in a given district to be exclusively NEA or AFT is especially evident in districts where the unions have negotiated agency shop clauses. Many nonmembers feel that they might as well pay regular union dues and gain the right to participate in union affairs, especially if the difference between the regular dues and the agency shop fee is not very large. Even in the absence of agency shop fees, the incumbent union typically enrolls most teachers as members; failure to do so would be a sign that the union is in danger of being ousted within a short time.</P>
<P>To illustrate how merger might affect state, but not local membership, we can compare the membership situation in South Dakota and Ohio. There are very few AFT affiliates and members in South Dakota, where NEA is the dominant union. In Ohio, however, although the Ohio Education Association (OEA) enrolls more members than the Ohio Federation of Teachers (OFT), several AFT locals such as those in Toledo, Cincinnati, and Cleveland, are the bargaining agents in their districts and enroll large numbers of teachers. For the sake of discussion, assume that the AFT local in Cleveland enrolls all the Cleveland teachers, and OEA affiliates enroll all the teachers in the Cleveland suburbs. Merger would not result in larger or even different membership levels at the local level, but it would result in a larger state and national organization than existed hitherto.</P>
<P>In practice, there may be some dual membership and/or membership in the minority union in any given school district. The extent of such membership depends on several factors but it seldom threatens the incumbent bargaining agent. Consequently, in states where bargaining laws have been in force for several years, and where local affiliates of the NEA and AFT are the minority union, they seldom challenge the incumbent union for bargaining rights.</P>
<P>It should be noted that management has an interest in avoiding union rivalry. The unions compete on the basis of which one can extract more benefits from management. For this reason, school management does not necessarily object to contractual provisions that render it difficult to organ-ize or sustain a rival union.</P>
<P>Incumbency as the bargaining agent may not protect a union from challenge in the rare situations (1) in which a minority union represents a threat to the incumbent union and (2) when both unions are competing to be chosen as the exclusive representative. The latter situation arises when a state enacts a bargaining law and both NEA and AFT affiliates compete for bargaining rights. The first situation most often arises when either the AFT or NEA affiliate gains exclusive representation rights by a narrow margin. The winning union is monitored closely and unless it negotiates a highly favorable contract, is accused of &#147;selling out&#148; or failure to achieve what supposedly could have been achieved.</P>
<P>The common thread that runs through all of these situations is that competition for bargaining rights is conducive to union militancy; with merger, competition between the two unions will disappear. Competition between teacher unions and other unions will not necessarily disappear; both kinds may compete for rights to represent support personnel. Of course, there will always be cases of intra-union conflict, and these cases usually exacerbate union militancy. Nonetheless, unless it blunders badly, incumbent union leadership is usually able to prevail over any challengers.</P>
<P>The incumbents control union publications and meetings and enjoy opportunities to meet the members, opportunities that are not available to opposing candidates for union office. Despite the necessity of being reelected, union leadership positions tend to be very secure. The advantages of incumbency in elective office in unions are very similar to their advantages in political office generally.</P>
<P>Because of the moratorium on representation challenges during the merger talks, incumbent unions are less likely to fear the consequences of accepting a reasonable board offer. At least until the end of the moratorium, accusations that union leadership has settled too meekly will be a management problem only in the context of internal rivalry in an incumbent union. The dynamics are the same, but the problem arises less frequently this way. One reason is that officers of incumbent unions control union media, but the dissidents must finance their challenges from personal funds. This is not the case when NEA and AFT locals are competing against each other; the challenges are financed from union, not personal funds. In the absence of an organizational rival, union negotiators can afford to be statesmen, if they are secure in their positions and do not assume the mantle too often.</P>
<P>At the local level union representation for nonteaching employees may become a very troublesome problem, at least in the short run. At the present time, several unions represent or seek to represent these employees. In practice, they are represented by:</P>
<P>&#149; Independent state associations of support personnel, such as the California School Employees Association (CSEA).</P>
<P>&#149; Local affiliates of the NEA.</P>
<P>&#149; Local affiliates of the AFT.</P>
<P>&#149; American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees  (AFSCME).</P>
<P>&#149; Service Employees International Union (SEIU).</P>
<P>&#149; Teamsters and miscellaneous unions.</P>
<P>Inasmuch as school districts employ large numbers of nonteaching employees, the various unions currently seeking to organize them are not likely to allow the NEA and/or AFT to organize them without a struggle. The independent state associations of school district employees have a long 
<BR>history of working with the teacher unions, but it seems likely that NEA/AFT will eventually organize most of the support personnel. First, the support personnel are constantly exposed to the political clout of the teacher unions. The teacher unions already function in the schools, hence they have a big advantage over the nonteacher unions in representation elections. Furthermore, the teacher unions have a stake in the matter that goes beyond the issue of union dues and resources; the ability of  teacher unions to engage in successful strikes depends partly on their support from nonteacher personnel. Significantly, the NEA and AFT have recently amended their constitutions to provide representation and governance rights within the union to support personnel. In some states, the independent state associations of support personnel may even-
<BR>tually affiliate with the AFL-CIO whether or not they merge with NEA/AFT.</P>
<P>Over time, however, merger will exacerbate the bargaining problems facing school boards. The NEA/AFT is likely to be even more successful than its two predecessors in enacting legislative changes favorable to teacher unions. Legalizing the right to strike, or expanding the scope of bargaining are likely to be legislative objectives of the merged union at the state level. As such legislative changes are enacted and affect bargaining at the district level, school boards will find it even more difficult than they do now to negotiate effectively or to manage their districts. Funds and resources devoted to organizational rivalry will be devoted to squeezing more from school boards and legislative bodies at all levels.</P>
<P>It is also likely that merger will exacerbate union militancy on certain issues. At all levels (local, state and federal), we can expect an intensive union drive to require or at least to authorize agency shop fees. In some situations, the minority union has objected to them, citing much the same arguments that are made by non-union or even anti-union forces. Legislators and school board members have sometimes cited these objections as a reason to oppose agency shop fees.</P>
<P>With merger impending or consummated, there is much less likelihood that the minority union will object to the fees; it will soon be part of the union that benefits from forcing every teacher and support employee to pay them. There is no point to objecting to agency shop fees if your union is going out of business, and your only objection to the fees was that a rival union would be the beneficiary of them.</P>
<P>Both the NEA and AFT are strong proponents of government subsidized health care. It is naive to assume their interest in it is primarily idealistic. Health insurance for school district employees requires a growing proportion of school budgets. To the extent that the costs of health care can be shifted to the federal government, more state and local funds will be available for teacher salaries. NEA and AFT support for a federal takeover of the costs of health care is based on their interest in promoting the welfare of persons who already have health care, not the interests of those who do not have it.</P>
<P>The teacher unions will adopt the position that the funds being spent for health insurance are essentially for teacher welfare; inasmuch as the general government is absorbing these costs, or to the extent that it does, the state and local funds no longer required for this purpose should be reallocated to teacher salaries. This negotiating objective will undoubtedly materialize even in the absence of merger, but the reallocation will be a major union objective in both the public and private sectors if and when comprehensive federal health care is enacted.</P>

<B> NEA/AFT and higher education</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>In 1992-93, the NEA and AFT each enrolled about 80,000 faculty in higher education. An NEA/AFT merger will have conflicting tendencies with respect to the union&#146;s role in higher education. Some aspects of merger will be conducive to increased membership and influence; merger will also create the potential for sizable defections from the NEA/AFT.</P>
<P>Let us consider first the tendency for merger to expand NEA/AFT membership in higher education. This tendency will result from the dynamics of union rivalry. Suppose that the faculty at university X are voting on whether to be represented by a faculty union. Suppose further that the faculty is divided on the issue as follows:</P>
<P>Percent</P>
<P>  &#149; 27  Favor representation by the NEA affiliate.</P>
<P>  &#149; 26  Favor no exclusive representative.</P>
<P>  &#149; 25  Favor the AFT affiliate.</P>
<P>  &#149; 22  Favor the AAUP affiliate.</P>
<P>In this situation, there would be a runoff election between the two highest options, representation by the NEA affiliate or no exclusive representative. The likelihood is that the &#147;no exclusive representative&#148; option would prevail in the runoff. The reason is that most of the faculty who support the AFT or AAUP affiliates would vote against representation by the NEA affiliate. If the vote for representation by the NEA affiliate wins, the AFT and AAUP affiliates will dwindle or even disappear as a player in faculty affairs. If the vote for representation by the NEA affiliate loses, the AFT and AAUP affiliates would still have a role to play in campus affairs. In addition they would also retain the opportunity to become the exclusive representative.</P>
<P>Merger would change the arithmetic and dynamics of this situation. For the sake of discussion, assume that the NEA and AFT affiliates maintained their level of support. In that case, NEA/AFT would carry 52 percent of the vote, enough to eliminate the &#147;no exclusive representative&#148; option. The point is that in some instances, academics favor exclusive representation if and only if their preferred union is the bargaining agent. An NEA/AFT merger would reduce the likelihood that this dog in the manger attitude would prevail. Needless to say, this is not the only reason merger would strengthen the NEA/AFT option in higher education, but it could be decisive in some states.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, merger would also create the potential for some large-scale defections, especially in states where affiliation with the AFL-CIO is newly mandated. The defectors would be most likely to switch to the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), that is, if the AAUP is still in existence at the time.</P>
<P>The AAUP has suffered from inept leadership for at least the past 30 years. In the 1960s, it could easily have enrolled most of the professoriate, or most of it inclined to support collective bargaining. Instead, the AAUP was the Hamlet of public sector bargaining; by the time it made a belated effort to accommodate bargaining, the NEA and AFT had achieved representation rights in several large state systems of higher education. Needless to say, their membership rolls increased substantially as a result.</P>
<P>Currently, the AAUP is in a precarious, perhaps even desperate situation. Its membership has declined from almost 100,000 to 33,000, of whom about 18,000 are in bargaining units on the East Coast and Mid-West. Nevertheless, a sizable minority of AAUP members are still opposed to bargaining. To retain its members, the AAUP adjusts its position on bargaining to whatever will fly at the institutional level. As the NEA Board of Directors Special Committee report states, &#147;AAUP will organize a chapter around anti-collective bargaining issues as readily as around collective bargaining.&#148; What hurt the AAUP was not its adjustment to institutional preferences; it was its failure to embrace bargaining where bargaining was clearly the preference or was potentially the preference at the institutional level. Thus, while the AAUP dithered and declined, the NEA and AFT gained a much larger share of the market for unionization among professors.</P>
<P>A merger of the NEA and AFT could provide the AAUP with an opportunity to rise from its cemetery plot. The association has never successfully exploited the fact that higher education interests are inherently subordinate to K-12 interests in the NEA and AFT. The two unions assert that professors will gain additional clout by joining their organizations, and this is no doubt true in some situations. Nevertheless, there are conflicting as well as common interests among professors and K-12 personnel, but the AAUP has failed to take advantage of them.</P>
<P>Also, status is the coin of the realm in higher education. It surely must rankle professors to realize that their national convention is dominated by K-12 personalities. No doubt one reason is that professors tend to think of their national organizations as the subject matter organizations; this tendency has played into the hands of the NEA and AFT. At any rate, the status concerns of professors will be greatly exacerbated if merger requires affiliation with the AFL-CIO in institutions where the faculty as a whole does not want it. Quite possibly, the AAUP is too moribund to take advantage of such opportunities; the possibility should not be discounted.</P>

<B> An alternative to NEA/AFT</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>Merger of the NEA and AFT will create both the need and the opportunity to establish a new teacher organization. For purposes of discussion, we shall refer to it as the National Teachers Association (NTA). The NTA would enroll teachers from the existing independent teachers associations, from private schools, and from the ranks of NEA and AFT members who are dissatisfied with NEA/AFT. Let us comment briefly on these potential sources of membership.</P>
<P>1.<U> </U><I>Independent teacher associations not affiliated with either the NEA or AFT</I>. The NEA estimates that about 160,000 teachers, mainly in states without bargaining laws, are members of the independent teacher associations. These associations have low dues (about $60-100 annually) but some also provide low cost insurance benefits for members. The report of the NEA&#146;s Special Committee that proposed merger talks also included several recommendations intended to weaken these independent teacher associations.</P>
<P>2.<U> </U><I>Private school teachers</I>. Private school teachers would constitute an important NTA constituency. In 1991-92, there were about 355,000 private school teachers in the United States. Many were members of denominational or other specialized private school teacher associations.</P>
<P>3.<U> </U><I>Defections from NEA/AFT</I>. An NEA/AFT merger will create the potential for substantial defections from the merged organization. The extent to which defections materialize depends on several complex factors, which are not clear at this time. In our view, individual defections will not play a major role in weakening NEA/AFT. Some individuals here and there will refuse, perhaps at great personal expense, to observe union solidarity or discipline, but reliance on large numbers of teachers to do so individually will be a losing strategy. The crucial issue will be how many teacher leaders at the state and local level will lead large numbers of their fellow teachers into a new organization with a non-union orientation.</P>
<P>It is impractical here to examine all the issues raised by the prospect of an alternative organization, but two major factors deserve brief mention. One is the fact that school management will often welcome a different mode of teacher representation. School management is partly responsible for the growth and influence of the NEA and AFT; it must now play a role in the difficult task of putting the genie back in the bottle. There are many ways to help; the question is whether school boards are willing to absorb immediate political hits to reduce NEA/AFT dominance.</P>
<P>The major negative to public school management will be NTA&#146;s acceptance of private schools. An alternative to NEA/AFT that is also supportive of private school options will pose a real dilemma for school boards and school administrators. Actually, if their underlying objective is education instead of public education as an institution, encouragement of NTA would not be such a problem; private school options should be available in order to pressure NEA/AFT locals to drop demands that impair the effectiveness of public schools.</P>
<P>In order to be a viable alternative to NEA/AFT, a teacher organization must have a membership base large enough to provide member benefits comparable to those offered by NEA/AFT. This objective can be reached if most private school teachers join an organization that also enrolls most of the teachers in the independent public school teacher associations. If such a merger could be arranged, NTA would have the critical mass required to provide the comparable benefits.</P>
<P>NEA/AFT will be oriented overwhelmingly to public education. It will do everything it can to weaken private schools. Thus, there is solid policy basis for private school teachers to unite in opposition to NEA/AFT, in addition to the other reasons for doing so.</P>
<P>One problem facing NTA would be how to reconcile the interests of public and private school teachers in the same organization, while remaining sufficiently attractive to both groups. The problem should be resolved on the basis that NTA supports good education, not just public or private education. In other words, NTA would not take sides on public/private school controversies except to argue that both sectors have legitimate interests that should be reflected in legislation and public policy. The analogue here would be to the American Medical Association, which does not get involved in disputes between public and private hospitals. Instead, it considers the interests of doctors in both. Private school management might be reluctant to encourage teachers to join NTA out of fear that its local affiliates would become quasi-unions, but this would be much less of a risk than their growing inability to oppose an organization which is determined to weaken them in every possible way.</P>
<P>Another problem facing NTA would be whether to challenge NEA/AFT locals in representation elections. As the NEA learned to its sorrow in the 1960s, it is extremely difficult to win such elections while being opposed to bargaining per se. The basic issue is whether it would be possible for NTA to avoid both the danger of appearing to be a management-dominated bargaining agent and the negatives associated with teacher bargaining. The issue requires careful study, but our tentative view is that NTA affiliates could avoid both horns of this dilemma. If so, they should challenge NEA/AFT affiliates where the former have a good chance to win.</P>
<P>The extent of defections from NEA/AFT will depend partly on the structure and policies adopted by it. However, AFT affiliates opposed to merger for any reason are not likely to join a non-union organization. Their reasons for opposition to merger are also likely to preclude their joining NTA, hence we doubt whether NTA would be able to enroll many AFT members unhappy about the merger for any reason.</P>
<P>The foregoing is not necessarily true of NEA members and affiliates. In fact, when the NEA adopted a unified dues structure in 1972, requiring members to join the national and state associations simultaneously, the Missouri State Teachers Association (MSTA) refused and withdrew from the NEA. In 1994, it continued to be the largest teacher organization in Missouri. Granted, its survival was due partly to some unique factors that would not be present in most situations elsewhere; for example, MSTA was a well-established organization with substantial resources, fighting against outsiders trying to dictate what it should do. Still, a substantial number of NEA members will be unhappy about NEA/AFT. If a viable alternative were available at the time when the negative features of NEA/AFT emerge, there should be frequent opportunities to persuade disaffected teachers to join the NTA. It will be crucially important whether NTA is functioning when the merger takes place; attempts to organize NTA afterwards will not be as successful. Of course, the very existence of an alternative would force the merger forces to try to accommodate potential defectors, but that is a risk that must be taken. Finally, because we lack data on the number of public school teachers who are not members of either NEA, AFT or an independent teacher association, we hesitate to draw any conclusions about their membership potential for NTA, except that the number is likely to be rather small and should not figure prominently in plans for NTA.</P>
<P>An alternative to NEA/AFT would face a host of other problems, but it would also have some things going for it. One is that as the only other comprehensive national organization, it would have convenient access to media and political forums. If there is a multitude of small teacher organizations it is easy to ignore all of them; none speaks for more than a remnant of the teachers outside of the NEA/AFT. An organization that represented 250,000 or more teachers could not be dismissed so easily. Furthermore, school boards repelled by teacher unionism would have reason to encourage a teacher organization that followed a more constructive approach to educational and employment issues. To be successful, NTA would probably have to enroll 50 percent of the private school teachers and at least 10 percent of those in public schools. Surprising as it may seem, the problem of unifying the private school teachers is probably the more difficult, but the effort has to be made to find out.</P>

<B> Merger as a wake-up call</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>The notion that three million or more teachers and another million support employees can be organized as a monolithic political and educational force is true in one sense, not in another. The NEA/AFT will include several hundred independent power bases that are not controlled by the national officers and staff. State and local affiliates will have their own personnel, structure, budgets, objectives, sources of revenue, and access to media. The overwhelming majority will share the common interest of preventing competition in the field of education, so the merged organization will be monolithic on this issue. However, it will be monolithic because of a common perception of member interests, not because of coercion from the top. Similarly, we can anticipate overwhelming support throughout NEA/AFT on noneducational issues that have important ramifications for the interests of NEA/AFT members; for example, the merged organizations will oppose limits on government expenditures or supermajorities to enact higher taxes.</P>
<P>As we move beyond these issues, however, unanimity is less likely. A teacher union in a district where hunting is popular will be likely to oppose gun control; a union in an urban district will support it. In addition, unan-imity on cultural issues seems highly unlikely. Even on some educational issues, like tracking and testing, there will be differences, often based on interests. The disadvantaged minorities will oppose standardized tests; others will support them. The unions will often split on proposals regarding school finance; affiliates in districts that are treated favorably under a proposal will support it whereas the affiliates that see themselves as treated inequitably will oppose it. Controversies over &#147;mainstreaming&#148; or &#147;inclusion&#148; of special education students already divide teachers and will do so for many years to come.</P>
<P>The fact, if it turns out to be a fact, that the merged organization will not be monolithic on all issues does not eliminate the problems of monopoly. NEA/AFT will be overwhelmingly supportive of high taxes, high spending, and of government intervention in the economy and in people&#146;s lives for all sorts of allegedly idealistic reasons. Generally speaking, NEA/AFT will be oriented to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Both unions are now, the NEA more so than the AFT.</P>

<B> Teacher unions and the conservatives</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>Perhaps the most important question about the merger is what will conservatives do about it. We use the term &#147;conservative&#148; to refer to a wide range of leaders, organizations, and political forces that emphasize free markets, minimal government, low taxes, limits on government expenditures, and other objectives commonly associated with a conservative outlook. Although libertarians usually object to being classified as conservatives, we include them in the definition for editorial simplicity.</P>
<P>While far from complete, the evidence we have presented should alert conservatives that they face an uphill battle in legislative arenas at all levels of government. Despite NEA/AFT support for a minuscule number of candidates who are not in the Democratic party, the teacher unions typically constitute a major handicap for conservative candidates that is not easily overcome. Of course conservatives often have their own core of automatic support, but it is minuscule compared to the teacher unions.</P>
<P>Needless to say, what conservatives do about the teacher unions, if anything, will be affected by several factors, but merger is likely to trigger a more intensive conservative interest in, and response to, teacher unions. Inexorably, teacher union political activities and financial operations will come under greater scrutiny than in the past. This is certain to increase public awareness of the conflicts between teacher union interests and the public interest.</P>
<P>In making this prediction, we do not overlook the fact that the teacher unions are geared to political action. Teachers improve their situation by political action, not by increased efficiency or greater productivity. Thus a large share of teacher resources supports an infrastructure that is focused directly on media and politics. The unions have legislative staff, media relations, research departments, and other agencies whose raison d&#146;&#234;tre is to influence media and politicians. When controversies over educational policy arise, these structures are in place, whereas the resources for opposing union positions must often be raised on an ad hoc basis.</P>
<P>Whatever merger adds to union power may be less important than its consciousness-raising effects, especially if affiliation with the AFL-CIO, if only on an optional or state-by-state basis, is part of the merger agreement. Thus, the fact that union membership will be over 50 percent from the public sector may be less important than public awareness of the fundamental change in the labor movement. The additional political clout resulting from merger may be overshadowed by wider recognition of teacher union political influence. In our view, therefore, the importance of merger lies outside the parameters of organizations, members, revenues, and resources. These may not change very much in toto, but public awareness of them may expand sharply. Thus the outcome of merger may be beneficial, even for those who are concerned, as we are, about the role of teacher unions in education and in American politics generally.</P>

<P>Essentially, teacher unions raise two fundamental issues which characterize public sector unionism generally. One issue emerges from the fact that school district labor contracts are public policies. They are personnel policies, but the critical point is their public nature. In terms of our political system, public sector labor contracts are like speed limits, tax rates, eligibility to vote in elections, compulsory education, and the myriad of other matters addressed by legislation. The fact that school district labor agreements are public policies is a point that the teacher unions themselves emphasize. </P>
<P>  In this context, the basic issue is whether the formulation and adoption of public policies by means of negotiations with one special interest group is consistent with democratic representative government. After all, school district labor contracts affect pupils, parents, taxpayers, employers, and a host of other interest groups and constituencies whose rights to influence public policy are diminished by teacher bargaining. The political inequality that results is especially evident in 
<BR>the debate over teacher strikes. From a government perspective, a teacher strike is a suspension of a public service. It is a suspension of a public service until one special interest, the teacher union, achieves public policies that are acceptable to it. No other special interest has this right or even claims that it should have it, at least on an ongoing basis. </P>
<P>  Clearly, acceptance or even toleration of teacher strikes reflects a political inequality of considerable importance; one special interest 
<BR>group can suspend public services to achieve the public policies they seek, the rest of us cannot do so. The fact that personnel policies are involved (&#147;terms and conditions of employment&#148; in bargaining terminology) does not mitigate this basic inequality or its inconsistency with our political system generally. True, most states have not legal-
<BR>ized teacher strikes, but this fact does not vitiate the point that is 
<BR>being made. Even in the states where teacher strikes are not legal, the legislative debates over whether to legalize them do not address 
<BR>the political inequality inherent in legalizing strikes by public school teachers. Obviously, the underlying issues apply to public employment generally and must be addressed in this larger context; it is unlikely that they can or will be resolved only in public education and teacher bargaining.</P>
<P>The second major issue emerges in the private as well as the public sector. While collective bargaining has flourished in the public sector, it has declined in the private sector. Less than 12 percent of the private sector labor force was unionized in 1993, compared to 36 percent in 1953. During this time, private sector employees have increasingly resorted to other techniques and procedures, especially litigation, to protect their interests. </P>
<P>Understandably, the private sector unions allege that the decline in private sector unionization is a deplorable fact to be remedied by strengthening the legal privileges and powers of private sector unions. This position, however, is not likely to prevail, at least in the industries subject to competition from abroad. The irony is that teachers embraced or accepted collective bargaining just when it began an irreversible decline in the private sector.</P>
<P>  The fundamental problem here is not the decline of the unions. It is that the framework of labor relations embodied in the National Labor Relations Act is seriously flawed and must be replaced by one that is more responsive to the needs and interests of employees, employers, and the public at large. To be sure, some of the reasons for the decline of unions in the private sector, such as competition from foreign producers, do not apply to public education, which is a government monopoly relatively immune from market competition. Nevertheless, other reasons for the decline are applicable to the public as well as the private sector. For this reason, it is essential to develop and adopt a new framework for public as well as private sector labor relations. Such a new framework is essential to avoid both the negative consequences of teacher bargaining and the unacceptable features of the pre-bargaining era. As long as the NLRA model continues to dominate school district employment relations, however, we can expect the negative consequences of teacher bargaining; any changes for the better are likely to be marginal and succeed only over strong union opposition. It is doubtful whether proposed basic changes in the framework of school district employment relations would result in even greater union opposition. </P>
<P>This point is especially relevant to the possibility of an organiza-tional alternative to the NEA/AFT. If such an alternative is a union committed to the collective bargaining model, the teacher reaction is likely to be &#147;Why bother to change?&#148; On the other hand, if the organiza-tional alternative merely opposes the collective bargaining framework, the implication is that it supports a return to the framework of employment relations in the pre-bargaining era. This is not likely to be persuasive, even among the teachers who were not around at that time. 
<BR>Consequently, a new framework of employment relations is essential. To be viable, an alternative to the NEA and AFT must propose such a framework. Thus the task that lies ahead is not simply to criticize the teacher unions, but to create a system of educational employment relations that avoids the deficiencies of the pre-bargaining era as well as those inherent in public sector bargaining. Unfortunately, relatively little attention is being paid to this task.</P>

<B> A. New Business Item 1993-A and 1993-B</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P>New Business Item 1993A</P>
<P>Adopted as Amended, NEA Convention</P>
<P>July 25, 1993, San Francisco, California</P>
<P>The circumstances which led the 1976 Representative Assembly to adopt a prohibition against any type of AFLCIO affiliation by NEA and its affiliates have changed. Because of this change, and because the 1976 prohibition affects NEA&#146;s ability to achieve its longstanding goal of uniting all education employees in a single national organization, NEA should have some flexibility in regard to the question of AFLCIO affiliation. Accordingly, the Representative Assembly directs the President to invite AFT and/or other labor organizations to enter into discussions with NEA regarding the possible establishment of a unified organization. Any organization that is proposed shall:</P>
<P>a. Guarantee minority group participation in the governance and operation of said organization;</P>
<P>b. Have democratic decision making procedures, including the use of the secret ballot to elect the officers and change the governing documents of said organization;</P>
<P>c. Be free to take positions and pursue objectives that are in the best interests of its members; and</P>
<P>d.  Not require any current affiliate of NEA to affiliate with or make per capita payments to AFLCIO.</P>
<P>Consistent with the prohibition in paragraph (d) above, the NEA representatives shall have the flexibility in the discussions to explore whether some type of affiliation relationship with AFLCIO is compatible with the goals and objectives of NEA and its affiliates.</P>
<P>The President shall report the status of the discussions to the Board of Directors on a regular basis, and shall submit to the Board on or before April 1, 1994, a written report, which shall include specific recommendations regarding the possible establishment of a single national organization of education employees. The NEA Board of Directors shall implement a systemic process by which every state affiliate shall be kept fully informed throughout the course of the exploratory discussions betweenthe NEA and the AFT&#151;and other organizations&#151;regarding the issue of merger/affiliation. In addition, the report that the President will submit to the board of directors on April 1, 1994, along with a full account of board action, shall be made available to all state affiliates well in advance of the 1994 NEA Representative Assembly. The Board of Directors shall act on the written report at its May 1994 meeting. The action taken by the Board of Directors, together with the written report, shall be submitted to the 1994 Representative Assembly. No final commitments shall be made and no final actions shall be taken by NEA with regard to the merger and/or AFLCIO affiliation without the approval of the 1994 Representative Assembly.</P>
<P>Any proposal(s) for merger and/or affiliation shall be voted by the RA after full debate at a regular session of the RA. The RA vote shall be by secret ballot.</P>
<P>Except as expressly modified by this New Business Item, New Business Items 1976A and 1976B shall remain in effect pending action by the 1994 Representative Assembly, and the Executive Committee shall continue in the interim to apply the concepts embodied in those New Business Items.</P>
<P>New Business Item 1993B</P>
<P>If NEA enters into national level unification discussions with AFT and/or other labor organizations pursuant to New Business Item 1993A, NEA shall at the outset of such discussions propose that the parties agree to the following two &#147;moratoriums&#148; at the state and local levels while the national level unification discussions are in progress: (a) a moratorium on unification discussions between NEA affiliates and affiliates of AFT and/or other labor organizations involved in the national discussions and (b) a moratorium on representational challenges between NEA affiliates and affiliates of AFT and/or other labor organizations involved in the national discussions.</P>
<P>Rationale</P>
<P>If New Business Item 1993A is adopted by the Representative Assembly and the NEA enters into a national level unification discussions with AFT and/or other labor organizations, the Board believes that the two moratoriums should be proposed at state and local levels, while unification discussions are in progress. See pp. 4 and 5 of the Report of the Special Committee on Relationships with Other Organizations for further rationale.</P>
<P>The first moratorium would prohibit unification discusions at state and local levels. The second would rule out representional challenges at state and local levels.</P>
<P>New Business Item 1993B will be voted on only if the 1993 Representative Assembly first adopts 1993A. If the Representative Assembly rejects New Business Item 1993A, the Board will withdraw 1993B.</P>
<P>Cost Implication</P>
<P>No additional cost to implement 1993B if 1993A is adopted.</P>

<B> E. NEA 1992 Interview Team Worksheet</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P><B>Interview Team Worksheet</B></P>
<P><B>1992</B></P>
<P>The Interview Team Worksheet serves as the questionnaire for the candidate interview. It provides order for the interview and assures that questions necessary to the endorsement process are covered.</P>
<P>Each team members should have a copy of the worksheet for each candidate to be interviewed. This assists team members in following the questions, provides them with a scale to rate individual responses, and space for very limited notes. Team members should not take copious notes during responses (let a tape recorder handle that).</P>
<P>The completed Candidate Questionnaire is the basis that guides the interview.</P>
<P><B>Reviewing the Interview Team Worksheet</B></P>
<P>1. Questions 14 are openended questions giving the candidate a chance to relax and open up. After hearing the candidate&#146;s opening statement (Question #1), you may decide to skip questions 2 and/or 3, feeling the candidate has already covered these points.</P>
<P>2. Question #5 seeks the extent of the candidate&#146;s commitment to increased funding for education. Many candidates may dispute the contention that the situation has grown worse. Specific information is included in this kit which explains the educational funding problem. This information can be found in the &#147;Background on NEA Issues&#148; document under question #1.</P>
<P>3. Questions #616 correspond to questions on the written questionnaire. They are asked in the interview because of their importance to the legislative program. Vague answers require additional probing. Try to pin the candidate down now while he/she is most acutely aware of the relationship between the issues we have identified and our political support.</P>
<P>If you feel that the candidate has clearly and fully answered these questions on the questionnaire, you should at least reinforce the issue. Example: &#147;We are pleased to see that your position on (_____) is fully in support of our own program.&#148;</P>
<P>4. During this phase of the interview the Chair should integrate any additional questions the team has identified for candidate elaboration or on which the candidate&#146;s written response has been vague or unclear. It is recommended that these additional questions be included in the same order they appear on the written questionnaire. Note interview question #7 corresponds to questionnaire Part II, question #1.</P>
<P>5. Following the last question drawn from the written questionnaire, ask any other issue questions which the team may have developed. (Remember that additional questions should be asked of all candidates to maintain equity in the process.)</P>
<P>6. Proceed with question #17 regarding the candidate&#146;s intentions towards working with the NEA. It is important that the candidate understand that the Association, not teacher friends and colleagues, is the vehicle for communication with and about issues that affect education or NEA members. Then close the first section of the interview with question #18, the closing statement.</P>
<P>7. Now take up the two openended questions relating to the candidate&#146;s campaign plans and expectations of Association help if endorsed. The team may wish to expand on these questions, particularly if there are doubts about the candidate&#146;s electability.</P>
<P>8. In closing be sure to let the candidate know how the endorsement process works and when he/she will be notified of the final endorsement decision.</P>
<P>It is extremely helpful to NEA lobbyists to know which issues were supported by the Members of Congress when they were candidates. Be sure <U>all</U> completed candidate questionnaires are forwarded to the appropriate NEA Government Relations field staff just in case our endorsed candidate is not elected.</P>

<B> F. Summary of Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act</B></FONT></A></H4></A>
<P><B>SUMMARY OF</B></P>
<P><B>LABOR</B><B>MANAGEMENT REPORTING</B></P>
<P><B>AND DISCLOSURE ACT</B></P>
<P>As frequently noted, the state and local teacher unions are regulated by state, not federal statutes. Under the LaborManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), unions subject to federal regulation are required to submit certain reports and union members have certain rights visavis their unions. These union obligations and member rights are summarized in Appendix E. The safeguards for union members in Appendix E were not ordinarily included in the state legislation applicable to teacher unions. The national organizations of the NEA and AFT are subject to the LMRDA but their state and local affiliates are not. The legislation providing bargaining rights for state and local public employees was initially drafted by the unions, hence it did not include member rights against the unions. Quite often, the proposed legislation was referred to state legislative committees with little or no sophistication about unions or labor relations issues. Consequently, state bargaining statutes frequently omit the safeguards for union members included in federal labor laws.</P>
<P>For this reason, closer scrutiny of the teacher unions is likely to reveal a great deal of negative information about them.</P>
<P><B>THE LABOR</B><B>MANAGEMENT REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE ACT</B></P>
<P>The LaborManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, as amended (LMRDA), grants certain rights to union members and protects their interests by promoting democratic procedures within labor organizations. The Act establishes a Bill of Rights for union members; reporting requirements for labor organizations, union officers and employees, mployers, laborrelations consultants, and surety companies; standards for the regular election of union officers; and safeguards for protecting labor organization funds and assets. Unions representing Federal employees are similarly covered by the implementing regulations of the standards of conduct provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Unions representing solely state, county, and municipal employees are not covered by either of these laws.</P>
<P>The Secretary of Labor enforces certain provisions of the LMRDA and has delegated that authority to the Department of Labor&#146;s Office of LaborManagement Standards (OLMS). Other provisions may only be enforced by union members through a private suit in a Federal District Court. Outlined below are the major provisions of the LMRDA.</P>
<P><B>Title I </B><B> Bill of Rights of Union Members</B></P>
<P>* Union members have equal rights to nominate candidates for union office, vote in   union elections, and participate in union meetings. They may also meet with other   members and express any opinions.</P>
<P>* Unions may impose assessments and raise dues only by democratic procedures. In   addition, unions must afford members a full and fair hearing of charges against   them.</P>
<P>* Unions must inform their members about provisions of the LMRDA.</P>
<P>* Members may enforce Title I rights through a private suit against the union, but may   be required to exhaust internal union remedies for up to four months.</P>
<P>* Union members and nonunion employees have the right to receive or to inspect   collective bargaining agreements. This right may be enforced by a union member   or by the Secretary of Labor.</P>
<P><B>Title II </B><B> Reporting Requirements</B></P>
<P>* Unions must file information reports, constitutions and bylaws, and annual financial   reports with the Office of LaborManagement Standards (OLMS).</P>
<P>* Officers and employees of labor unions must report any loans and benefits received   from, or certain financial interests in, employers whose employees their unions   represent and businesses that deal with their unions.</P>
<P>* Employers and laborrelations consultants who engage in certain activities to per  suade employees about their union activities or to supply information to the em  ployer must file reports.</P>
<P>* Surety companies which issue bonds required by the LMRDA or the Employee Re  tirement Income Security Act of 1974 must report data such as premiums re  ceived, total claims paid, and amounts recovered.</P>
<P>* The Secretary of Labor has authority to enforce the reporting requirements of the Act.</P>
<P>* The reports and documents filed with OLMS are public information and any person   may examine them or obtain copies at OLMS offices.</P>
<P>* Filers must retain the records necessary to verify the reports for at least five years.</P>
<P>* Unions must make reports available to members and permit members to examine   records for just cause.</P>
<P><B>Title III </B><B> Trusteeships</B></P>
<P>* A parent union which places a subordinate body under trusteeship must file initial,   semiannual, and terminal trusteeship reports.</P>
<P>* A trusteeship may only be imposed for the purposes specified in the LMRDA and   must be established and administered in acordance with the constitution and   bylaws of the labor organization which has assumed trusteeship over the subordi  nate body.</P>
<P>* A parent union which imposes a trusteeship may not engage in specified acts involv  ing the funds and delegate votes from a trusteed union.</P>
<P>* The Secretary of Labor has authority to investigate alleged violations of this Title. A   union member or a subordinate labor organization may also enforce Title III provi  sions except for the reporting requirements.</P>
<P><B>Title IV </B><B> Elections</B></P>
<P>* Local unions must elect their officers by secret ballot; international unions and inter  mediate bodies must elect their officers by secret ballot vote of the members or by   delegates chosen by secret ballot.</P>
<P>* International unions must hold elections at least every five years, intermediate bod  ies every four years, and local unions every three years.</P>
<P>* Unions must comply with a candidates&#146;s request to distribute campaign material to   members at the candidate&#146;s own expense and must also refrain from discriminat  ing against any candidate with respect to the use of membership lists. Candidates   have the right to inspect a list containing the names and addresses of members   subject to a union security agreement within 30 days prior to the election.</P>
<P>* A member in good standing has the right to nominate candidates, to be a candidate   subject to reasonable qualifications uniformly imposed, to hold office, and to sup  port and vote for the candidates of the member&#146;s choice.</P>
<P>* Unions must mail a notice of election to every member at their lastknown home   address at least 15 days prior to the election.</P>
<P>* A member whose dues have been withheld by an employer may not be declared   ineligible to vote or to be a candidate for office by reason of alleged delay or   default in the payment of dues.</P>
<P>* Unions must conduct regular elections of officers in accordance with their constitu  tion and bylaws and preserve all election records for one year.</P>
<P>* Union and employer funds may not be used to promote the candidacy of any candi  date. Union funds may be utilized for expenses necessary for the conduct of an   election.</P>
<P>* Union members may hold a secret ballot vote to remove from office an elected local   union official guilty of serious misconduct if the Secretary of Labor finds that the   union constitution and bylaws do not provide adequate procedures for such a   removal.</P>
<P>* Union members who have exhausted internal election remedies or who have in  voked such remedies without obtaining a final decision within three calendar months   after their invocation may file a complaint with the Secretary within one calendar   month thereafter.</P>
<P>* The Secretary of Labor has authority to file a suit in a Federal District Court to set   aside an invalid election and to request a new election under the supervision of   the Secretary and in accordance with Title IV.</P>
<P><B>Title V </B><B> Safeguards for Labor Organizations</B></P>
<P>* Officers have a duty to manage the funds and property of the union solely for the   benefit of the union in accordance with its constitution and bylaws.</P>
<P>* A union officer or employee who embezzles or otherwise misappropriates union funds   or other assets commits a Federal crime punishable by a fine and/or imprison  ment.</P>
<P>* Officials who handle union funds or property must be bonded to provide protection   against losses.</P>
<P>* A union may not have outstanding loans to any one officer or employee convicted of   any willful violation of the LMRDA.</P>
<P>* Persons convicted of certain crimes may not hold union office or employment for up   to 13 years after conviction or after the end of imprisonment.</P>
<P><B>Title VI </B><B> Miscellaneous Provisions</B></P>
<P>* Authority is granted to the Secretary of Labor to investigate possible violations of   most provisions of the LMRDA (except those specifically excluded) and to enter   premises, examine records, and question persons in the course of the investiga  tion.</P>
<P>* A union or any of its officials may not fine, suspend, expel, or otherwise discipline a   member for exerciseof rights under the LMRDA.</P>
<P>* No one may use or threaten to use force or violence to interfere with a union member   in the exercise of LMRDA rights.</P>
<P><B>Title VII </B><B> Amendments to the Taft</B><B>Hartley Act</B></P>
<P>* Another Federal law, the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), is amended by   the LMRDA with regard to such matters as strikes, boycotts, and picketing. The   LMRA is administered by the National Labor Relations Board (NRLB), an inde  pendent Federal agency.</P>

California proposal would expand options for those in worst schools. Charter schools providing real alternatives. Despite recurring bond issues, facilities are in place for Texas size influx of students. Ohio school district finds path to solvency through private contracting.</FONT></A></H3></A>
<H4><B>St. Louis public school officials told to learn from the competition</B></H4>
<P>The mayor of St. Louis has called for a review of how local Catholic schools are managed in order to save the city&#146;s failed school system.  St. Louis schools serve 43,619 students with a budget of $326 million and 6,167 employees.  The Archdiocese serves 59,303 children with a budget is $150 million and staff of 3,000.  There are 300 administrators in St. Louis public schools.  The Catholics run their schools with 11 managers.  Cost per public school student in St. Louis is $8,334 vs. $2,110 for private schools. Public schools graduate 27% of ninth graders.  The Catholic system graduates</P>
<P>80%.</P>
<H4><B>California proposal would expand options for those in worst schools</B></H4>
<P>A California measure that would allow children in schools scoring  in the bottom 5% to choose a new school has passed the Assembly Education Committee.</P>
<H4><B>Charter schools providing real alternatives </B></H4>
<P>A survey of students attending charter schools in Arizona revealed that 69% of charter students attended traditional public school the prior year. About 19% attended private school, 6% had been home schooled and the remainder were too young for school last year.</P>
<P>More than one-third of charter schools target at-risk students.  In general,</P>
<P>children who enter Arizona charter schools score below average on standardized tests.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, charter schools that are not performing are being held</P>
<P>accountable.  Two schools have been put on notice they have until June to get their finances in order.</P>
<H4><B>Despite recurring bond issues, facilities are in place for Texas size influx of students</B></H4>
<P>According to recent statistics, there are 342,387 churches in the United States.  That means an enormous amount of facilities are already in place in America&#146;s neighborhoods, much of which is unused during the week.  Only about 6% of these churches operate a school.   This unused capacity could come in handy for those wanting to operate private or charter schools.  If half of churches not operating schools allotted space for a single classroom of 22 students, America could immediately serve an additional 3.5 million school children.  That is enough capacity to seat 90% of the school children in Texas.</P>
<P>Long term school debt in Texas was equal to $2,465 per student in the 1994-95 school year.  Each use of a private facility already in place is a break for the property tax payer.</P>
<H4><B>Ohio school district finds path to solvency through private contracting</B></H4>
<P>Springfield, Ohio&#146;s superintendent of schools says focusing on ways to save</P>
<P>money instead of  ways to find money helped turn his financially troubled</P>
<P>district around.  This philosophy led to a savings of $750,000 over five</P>
<P>years after the district began contracting for bus service.  The district</P>
<P>also improved efficiency, reduced costs and looked to private contractors</P>
<P>for other services as it paid off 14 years worth of debt to the state&#146;s</P>
<P>emergency loan fund.  The district is now back in the black and part of a</P>
<P>trend.  According to a nationwide survey by American School and University</P>
<P>magazine, 40% of U.S. schools plan to seek more outside contracts in the</P>
<P>future.</P>

<H3>Welcome to the WEA Challenger Network <i>CHALLENGER BOARD!</H3></center>
<p>
<h5>We are very excited to have you join us on-line!  Communicating the public and our members is critical to making headway against the giant Washington Education Association and National Education Association.  As you may have noticed, to save space on the message input screens we did not included most labels and instructions.  As a result, you may be unsure about how to leave messages.  The following instructions should help.  Once you become used to the process, posting messages on the CHALLENGER BOARD should be fun and easy!</h5><p>

We request that you do not use heading tags which will make your 
message much larger and more difficult to read.

<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<I><B>There they go again.<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
Using innuendo, distortions, and inflammatory rhetoric, the teacher-bashers
seek every forum possible to pound on their issues, to attempt
to raise funds for their causes, and to attack the NEA and its
2.2 million members.<BR>

<P>
Contrary to the myths that these organizations continue to spread,
the NEA has a proud history of advocating legislation that benefits
children and schools. We're no Johnny Come Lately to education
reform. From the G.I. Bill, to the Land Grant Act, to the Education
for All Handicapped Children Act, NEA has successfully worked
on a national level to achieve legislation that advances education
and benefits children.<BR>

<P>
In every state where significant education reform measures have
been enacted, the Association took a leadership role by either
initiating it, gaining support for it, or helping to shape it
into something that advances education and benefits children.
<BR>

<P>
Yes, we are opposed to proposals that would weaken public education,
diminish accountability, or allow for the arbitrary and capricious
treatment of education employees. One thing many of the proposals
we oppose have in common is that there is no empirical evidence
they improve education: private school tuition vouchers, tuition
tax credits, watering down licensure requirements or due process
protections, etc. By contrast, most of the proposals we have supported
have been tested - with proven results: reducing class size, expanding
access to professional development, raising standards for entry
into the teaching profession, and providing additional help to
disadvantaged and special needs students, especially in the early
years.<BR>

<P>
Our members, individually and collectively, have been involved
in numerous efforts over the years to improve schools. We've focused
our energies on programs that help public school students master
the basics, seek systemic or system-wide solutions to improvement
rather than going after change in a piecemeal fashion, and since
1968 our National Foundation for the Improvement of Education
has supported teacher innovation in the art and science of teaching.
There's more, too. A five-year research project has given us a
&quot;yardstick&quot; by which we can measure what makes a good
school. And NEA has been in the forefront of efforts to reform
teacher education, as well as certification. We're working with
17 colleges and universities that are reshaping the way future
educators are trained.<BR>

<P>
NEA is leading the charge for better schools. Our vision for all
children is a vision of safe schools, active learning, advanced
technology, and modern classrooms. Our vision includes keeping
things that are working well in schools and scrapping those that
are not.<BR>

<P>
Instead of taking cheap shots at NEA, the detractors of public
education and the NEA should ask our members how they are working
to improve education in their local communities.<BR>

<P>
Delegates to the NEA Representative Assembly are meeting in Washington
this week to discuss such important education issues as how to
strengthen student performance, ways to improve student discipline,
and how teachers can improve their own performance and profession.

Getting on and off a mailing list just got a whole lot easier!</font><br><br>
Search, subscribe, unsubscribe and set options for 10's of thousands of mailing lists using simple forms input.
<br><br>
For those new to mailing lists or discussion groups, they provide a unique method of exchanging ideas on almost any topic in the known universe.  The best part is that the messages arrive as e-mail, and you can reply just as you would to any e-mail.  Mailing lists tend to create a more close knit community than do newsgroups, and they usually having a lower noise ratio and much less flaming.  Mailing lists also can be started by anyone, so enjoy, and check back often to find out about new lists. </strong>

<li><b>Oct. 4th, 1996 - <a href="http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/mars/">Live From Mars</a></b><br>
	In 1996 NASA will launch two missions to Mars. The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft will be launched in November and
will arrive about nine months later to begin an orbital mission that will provide detailed mapping and weather information. The
Mars Pathfinder spacecraft will lift-off in December and will land on the Red Planet on July 4, 1997. Once landed, the mission
plan calls for a micro-rover named Sojourner to begin wandering the Martian terrain, returning a wealth of new science data.

By participating in the Live from Mars project, you and your students can travel along! The project is targeted at the middle
school grade levels, but will have appeal above and below that range. <p>

<li>
<b>Sept. 25th, 1996 - <a href="http://redfrog.norconnect.no/~cag/">The Children's Art Gallery</a></b><br>
	This is an experimental project. The gallery offers free exhibition space to children who wish
 to present their drawings. They hope to create a sharing platform where children, parents and
teachers could meet and share a part of their live experience captured in children's drawings
                                with each other. Submissions are encouraged.<p>

<li><b>September 18th, 1996 - <a href="http://www.dk.com/dk/dhspt.html">Dinosaur Hunter</a></b><br>

past and learn about dinosaurs by searching for fossils to assemble and bring to life
as fully animated dinosaurs. The
latest CD-ROM in the award-winning Eyewitness Virtual Reality series. <p>

	 This is a great page with a lot of genealogy links, an index of surnames, and a lot more. A new Anson County Genealogy Book is in the process of being written by the author. This site makes me wish I lived in Anson County, and could use the resources available!<p><BR><P>

<li><b>August 12th, 1996 -- <A HREF="http://www.janyce.com/gene/rootdig.html">
        Root Diggin' Department                                 </A> </b><br>
	A great genealogy page, and it has a good collection of <a href="http://www.janyce.com/gene/freestuf.html">Free Stuff!</a> This page has an interesting section, called <em>Flowers & Thorns</em> that lists their awards, and a 'worst background award'. I didn't find it so bad, and I applauded their wonderful sense of humour!<p>

<li><b>August 1st, 1996 - <a href="http://pathfinder.com/@@8znBEQcAYhAeGyuh/ew/Welcome.html">Entertainment Online</a></b><br>
	Weekly magazine, movie reviews, multimedia reviews, but most importantly, if you're as tired of summer reruns as I am, <em>The Fall Movie Preview</em>!<p> 


<li><b>July 14th, 1996 - <a href="http://www.counsel.com/cyberspace/">Cyberspace Law for Non-Lawyers</a></b> <br>
	As you're sitting around the fire, or should I say around the computer downloading the latest neato kiddies game you might wonder about the copyright. Check out this site for your legal concerns. They cut right through the mumble jumble of most legal talk.<p>


<li><b>July 8th, 1996 - <a href="http://www.pacificrim.net/~proactiv/gametime/"><font size=+1>Game Time</font></a></b><br>
	GameTime is a sports calendar program that tells you whether your favorite team is playing on the current
     date, who they are playing, where and when game time is. (And it tells you the current time down to a fraction
     of a second, so you won't be late.) Every team, every game for the whole season. And even more importantly, Game Time is <b>FREE!</b><p>

<li><b>July 1st, 1996 - <a href="http://www.eduplace.com/kids/">Kid's Summer Clubhouse</a><br></b>
	This site features <em>The Great Summer Reading Challenge</em>. There's still time to get in on the action, and win a prize! There's also a <I>Brain Teasers Contest</I>. You should really check this one out. The graphics are very appealing! <p></td></tr><tr><td>

<li><b>June 18th, 1996 - <a href="http://www.tapirback.com/tapirgal/">The Tapir Gallery</a></b>	There is a surprising sub-culture on the net devoted to tapirs. This is a good jumping off point if you're interested in learning more about Tapirs. There's some great pictures on this site, and information about their endangered species status, their taxonomy and evolution, up-to-date zoo information, and so much more. I never knew there was so much interesting information about tapirs!<p>  <center><hr width=80%></center><p>

<a href="http://www.lego.com"><IMG SRC="toy4anim.gif" WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=81 align=right border=0></a>
	In our house when we break out the LEGO blocks it quickly becomes a family affair. There are a lot of sites devoted to these marvelous blocks, but this is the <em>official</em> site and their site <em>shows</em> it! The graphics you see here are just a small example of the wonders to be found at the official LEGO site.  Don't bother trying to resist, your entire family will enjoy it!<BR>

Seattle FilmWorks - get two rolls of Seattle FilmWorks film free!  Just fill in the information and they'll rush you two rolls of film (200 & 400 ASA)!<br><br>
Stefanie wrote us on Dec. 30, 1996 at about 3:00 pm est to say:<br>
"Just wanted to let you know so you could let your visitors know that the
Seattle Filmworks offer has a catch.  You have to get your free film
developed by them - no one else will develop it.  My pictures that I had
developed through them weren't the greatest I've ever seen, but they
weren't bad.  I would rather go through Clark for $3 - Seattle Filmworks
is an average of $9-10 per roll.<br>
Just thought you might want to know!!"<br>
Thanks for the information, Stefanie!<br><br>
Stephens wrote us on Dec. 31, 1996 at about 1:00 am est to say:<br>
I just wanted to add to what Stefanie said about Seattle Filmworks. It
is true that it costs more to get your pictures developed by them, but
they send you a free roll of film each time you get a roll developed.
Also, they have a service where they put all of your pictures on a
floppy disk or you can even download your pictures from their internet
site. I think that costs an extra $3.95 or so.<br>
Thanks to Stephens also!<br><br>
Jessamyn wrote to us on Dec. 31, 1996 at about 11:30 am pst to say:<br>
I have gotten plenty of film from Seattle File Works and
have been able to get it processed at many of those mail
away places [Clark comes to mind, but there have been
others]. You DO get nagging mail from SFW asking why you haven't
returned your film for processing, but I can handle that. Their
film is good and they hae some nifty processing options, like
getting your pictures on a computer disk as well as prints.<br>
Thanks Jessamyn for the info!<br><br>
Laura wrote to us on Dec. 31, 1996 at about 4:58 am mst to say:<br>
Just wanted to send a quick note that i got the free film, and then had
york develop it with no problems for almost half the price that seattle
wanted. <br>

<b>Home Project July 19, 1996:<br>
Remove Heavy Body from Truck Single-Handedly!</b><br><br>

<em>Removing a heavy body from a truck can be a one man job! </em>  First, you need to embed 4 sturdy uprights made of old railroad ties into concrete.  Next, remove any bolts that attach the body to the frame.  Slip two lengths of 2" pipe through metal collared holes in the body aligned with the uprights.  Place a jack on the stepped down outer section of one of the uprights.  Jack the pipe end up until you can insert a U-shaped block between the pipe and the higher inner section of the upright.  <br><br></td></tr>

<IMG SRC="http://www.zia.com/hag/projects/hp47b.gif" ALT="Home Projects 47b.-picture" 
BORDER=0 UNITS=pixels></td>
<td valign=top>
Repeat the operation until the truck body is supported entirely by the posts.  Climb into the truck and  pull it into the clear.  The heavy truck body remains behind resting securely on the heavy railroad ties.  This concept and method can be applied to remove nearly anything that is heavy from the back of a pickup.<br><br>

Cut Corners to Fill Small Jars</b></a><br><br>
<em>
A corner cut from an envelope makes a great funnel for filling small jars like salt and pepper shakers.  </em>If cut as shown, so that the flaps can be bent down, you'll have a self-seating funnel that will hold itself open!
