<H3> <B>Spain weighs up DM/&#165; for $1bn+ year-end financing </B> </H3> 

<P> 

<B>THE KINGDOM of
Spain is lining up a jumbo bond for launch in the next few days, in a deal that
bankers expect to be one of the last major Euromarket financings of 1996.
</B>


<p><I>Euroweek</I> understands that both a yen and a Deutschmark transaction are
under consideration, but the yen market looks to be the more likely choice.

<P> Spain needs to raise the equivalent of $1bn before the end of the year, but
may decide to raise more if market conditions allow. Some bankers have suggested
this figure may go as high as DM2bn.

<P> The country had been looking to issue an Ecu transaction, but with that
market unable to digest volumes as large as Spain needs to raise, the ministry of
finance has been forced to look elsewhere.

<P> "We are looking for some financing, but it is not yet certain when or in what
currency it will be," said Federico Ferrer, head of foreign funding at the
Spanish treasury. "But we are focusing on the yen and the Deutschmark sectors.

<P> "We have a preference for two maturities -- five years and 10 years, although
it would be possible to go longer than 10 years in yen," he added. Any issue is
likely to be launched this year with a payment date in early January.

<P> According to bankers, both the five and 10-year sectors are being considered
in Deutschmarks, and there is a strong possibility that any yen issue could be
for as long as 20 years.

<P> Spain has not tapped the Euro-DM market since a DM2.5bn five-year bond in
December 1994 via Commerzbank and Bayerische Landesbank. The deal paid a spread
of 25bp over Bunds.

<P> Spain has, however, already issued in the Euroyen market this year, with an
internationally targeted &#165;150bn 10-year issue via Nikko Europe launched in
September at 8bp over JGBs.

<P> Despite the relative scarcity of EU sovereign paper this year, bankers in
Frankfurt said they were uneasy at the prospect of a jumbo transaction being
launched in the Euro-DM sector before the end of the year. In particular, they
said, the five-year DM sector has been overloaded with tightly priced paper
recently following the World Bank, IADB and Denmark -- all with DM500m issues --
and Samsung, Hokkaido Electric and Oesterreichische Investitionskredit with
DM300m issues.

<P> Many of the recent deals have widened considerably after launch. For example
Denmark's issue, led by HSBC Trinkaus, was launched this Wednesday at 22bp over
the new benchmark Obl 120 and had widened to 27bp over at one point, according to
syndicate members.

<P> The 10-year part of the curve looks equally unreceptive. For example, a
DM500m for Rheinhyp, rated similarly to Spain at Aa2 by Moody's, struggled at its
launch spread of 31bp over, widening to 34bp over.

<P> Spain has a reputation in the international bond markets as an aggressive
issuer. Bankers are concerned that, given the limited amount of demand in the
Deutschmark sector, the prospective launch spread for a five-year deal of
24bp-26bp over the Obl 120 may not be enough to tempt  sufficient buyers out
of their shells for a transaction of around DM2bn.

<P> "Investors have virtually closed down their books for the year," said one
banker in Frankfurt.

<P> Politically, the Spanish treasury would probably prefer to launch a
Deutschmark transaction as a statement of its commitment to signing up for
European monetary union. But if the market cannot match the terms Sapin is
looking for, the yen is a strong alternative.

<P> Although Spain has issued jumbo yen transactions, all for &#165;150bn, in
each of the last three years, with Japanese interest rates now at all-time low
levels it could have an opportunity to lock in long-term funding at minimal
yields by launching a longer-dated deal aimed specifically at Japanese investors.
The most likely option would be a 20-year offering priced over the JGB superlong
no 33.

<P> The Republic of Italy launched the last jumbo long-dated Euroyen from an EU
sovereign in late October, a &#165;100bn 20-year transaction priced at around
23bp over superlongs.

<P> Bankers say that if Spain were to come at a similar level, it would imply a
coupon of around 3.55%, which some consider would be too aggressive for the
&#165;100bn-plus that Spain would need to cover its entire financing requirement
in one go.

<P> "The ideal solution for Spain might be to launch smaller deals in both
markets," said one London banker. But that option is considered unlikely.

<P> So far this year, Spain's only financings other than the September yen deal
have been in the French franc market.

<P> In July, it launched a Ffr6bn 10-year issue via lead manager
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, which was increased by Ffr3bn in
late October, creating the largest ever Euro-French franc transaction.

<P> However, the increase was criticised by some syndicate banks for coming at a
spread tighter than the original transaction's secondary trading level, and at a
time when there were still bonds from the first tranche outstanding (a claim
denied by SocGen).

<P> Nomura is seen as favourite to win the mandate for a yen transaction, having
not led a Spain Euroyen since February 1992, and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell has yet
to win a lead manager role on a Spain DM deal.

<P> However, given Spain's reputation for awarding mandates to the highest
bidder, the competition is likely to be extremely fierce for possibly the last
high-profile mandate of the year.

<P>

<H3> Demand from Japan drives dollar, sterling transactions </H3> 

<P> THE PACE of issuance slowed a little this week
with many frequent borrowers having completed the majority of their funding
activities for the year, and the continued lack of arbitrage preventing them from
coming to the market for cheap year-end funding.

<P> It also appeared that investors in some sectors were preparing to shut up
shop, with fewer deals this week targeted to Swiss and Benelux retail.

<P> The notable exception, and the buyers that could provide the prime funding
opportunities for the rest of the year and beyond, were Japanese investors.

<P> The World Bank was the quickest to spot the benefits of tapping the pent-up
demand from Japanese retail investors with two jumbo dollar transactions this
week raising a combined $1.9bn.

<P> The first deal, a $1bn offering due March 2003 with Yamaichi as sole lead,
was launched on Tuesday. The  issue was designed to coincide with the bonus
season in Japan, and aimed to attract tens of thousands of high net worth
individuals.

<P> The temptation for investors was the coupon of 5.15%, offering a pick-up of
almost 400bp over three-year yen-denominated corporate bonds, which more than
compensated for the added currency risk, Yamaichi officials said.

<P> It was a similar story with the World Bank's Nikko-led $900m one-year
transaction, whose 4.7% coupon provided a greatly enhanced yield over yen and
dollar time deposits.

<P> The World Bank was not the only supranational getting in on the
Japanese-targeted dollar act, with the IADB launching a $180m four-year deal via
IBJ and New Japan Securities.

<P> The sterling sector was also dominated by Japanese demand-led transactions.
Last Friday Nikko launched a &#163;60m retail-targeted offering due July 1999 for
IFC, which was the first such plain vanilla sterling transaction.

<P> Japanese investors had been looking at the high yields on offer in the
sterling sector as an alternative to Aussie and Kiwi dollars, and Nikko did not
rule out the possibility of a dual-currency bond with sterling redemptions.

<P> Meanwhile the Kingdom of Denmark's four-year transaction was increased by
lead manager Daiwa from &#163;100m to &#163;125m and 50% was sold to Japanese
regional institutions, attracted by a yield differential of close to 6% over
four-year JGBs.

<P> The pull of Japanese investors could be further demonstrated before the end
of the year if the Kingdom of Spain opts to go for a long-dated jumbo yen
transaction rather than issue in the more politically correct Euro-DM sector.

<P> Elsewhere, the lira sector continued to be buoyant both in terms of issuance
and investor demand.

<P> The highlight of this week's issues was a Euro-lira debut for Argentine oil
company YPF, a Lit300bn five-year bond led by Chase and BCI at 209bp over BTPs.
The issue was several times oversubscribed by Italian and international investors
looking for high-yielding product.

<P> The Republic of Argentina is expected next week with a Lit500bn issue
rumoured to have been mandated to Chase. It will be the first 10-year emerging
market deal in lire.

<P> Brazilian development bank BNDES should also launch a lira debut soon after
awarding a mandate to Paribas, Merrill Lynch and Credito Italiano.

<P> There were relatively heavy volumes of issues in Deutschmarks but only one
issue received much acclaim. A DM400m subordinated 10-year issue for Swiss Bank
Corp was re-offered at 60bp over the Bund, tightened to 50bp over, was increased
to DM500m at 50bp over and still traded in to around 48bp over.

<P> Denmark added to its sterling transaction by launching a DM500m issue via
HSBC Trinkaus, the first deal priced over the new Bobl 120 five-year benchmark.

<P> But the success of the sterling transaction was not repeated, and the deal
soon widened to full fees.

<H3>DIARY OF AN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT BANKER </H3>
<p>
<H2>Is there a Bahnhofstrasse on Mars? </h2>
<H4>Jean-Claude Komarovsky masterminds a bid for the widest mandate ever contemplated
in the history of the Universe, and visits a squirrel farm near Woking.</H4>
</H3>
<font size=3>
Excitement is above average at Black Knight. Today The Globe Bank is coming
to see us - the first visit since they found out we dumped their last dollar
deal on the brokers. <BR>
<BR>
JJ Ingersoll, head of global focus, has told me to get hold of as many boxes
of Stabilo Boss highlighter pens as I can, and a couple of paper knives.
He says it will be a presentation the likes of which we've never seen before.
Well, not since Jessica Einekleinenachtmusik was here in 1989 when she took
the wrong turn and thought she was at Goldman. <BR>
<BR>
<B>I</B> hear a loud booming laugh, like the Nazis saying hello to Poland
with unfriendly planes, and I know why: the head of funding for GlobeBank
has arrived with his legion of coffee drinking basis-point squeezers, called
co-head of dollars and things like that. Before I can even put the pink
or lime-green fluorescent pens on the table, Truger Rottweiler is in our
James Bond-style meeting room complete with eight television screens and
a monorail train that was supposed to go to Heathrow terminals one and four
before we ran out of money in February 1993. <BR>
<BR>
Rottweiler says guten Tag and asks me if I know what a repo facility is,
and if so why haven't I bothered to use the one we set up for their last
Deutschmark deal? I laugh and say: &quot;Never let it be said again that
the Swiss don't have a sense of humour.&quot; JJ Ingersoll scowls slightly
and adjusts his baseball cap. &quot;How are things Truger?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Not sehr gut,&quot; replies Rottweiler, &quot;our new boss, Mr Volfensons,
came to see me yesterday, and told me he wanted to write off several parts
of Africa's debt and to hell with the credit rating. He looks like he actually
believes in development. Very worrying.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Heh,&quot; says JJ in a delighted, globally focused way, knowing GlobeBank
are so desperate they might even mandate us. &quot;Truger, we've got the
answer to your problem. Forget Moody's, forget the fact your premium is
getting about as thin as the ozone layer, forget Earth in fact. We've been
swinging our dicks around in here and we've come up with the ballsiest trade
you're ever gonna see.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The pitch is working I can tell because three of Truger's basis-point squeezing
yes-people are bouncing up and down, and Truger says &quot;How?&quot; Just
then the room goes slightly dark because the electronic blinds whirr down,
and a couple of security guards come in with long hoovers to sweep for bugs.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Let me introduce our newest recruit,&quot; says JJ, &quot;This is
Callum Kelly, who we recently headhunted from Nasa. He's been working on
an altogether new form of security.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Thanks, JJ&quot; says Callum, standing up and removing a pair of goggles.
&quot;While I was with the space agency we started to realize that there
was a whole area of untapped demand out there. A probe we sent up told us
that there are fixed income investors in most of the planets in our solar
system. But up until now they've tended to be interested only in equities,
and it's clear this is changing. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The competition you're facing in the global bond market is fierce,
so why not do a universal bond instead.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
JJ comes in: &quot;I think you realize, Truger, this firm's always had global
placement in Asia and Europe, which ties up nicely with our untouchable
US presence, but we feel we also have the capability to secure universal
placement - at least in this solar system and the Milky Way.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
One of Truger's people asks what we know so far. &quot;Well, Hubble pictures
prove conclusively that there is something resembling a Bahnhofstrasse on
Mars, and we suspect the Belgian dentists of the universe are on Uranus...&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
I pipe up: &quot;Truger, there's a whole set of retail demand on Uranus,
with good follow-through. They're pretty spread insensitive on Uranus too.&quot;
Somebody near the back has to wipe the corners of her mouth, and a young
Italian slaps himself. This is going so well. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;But there are a couple of drawbacks,&quot; says Callum, readjusting
his standard issue anti-gravity boots so he can walk up one of the walls.
&quot;We suspect that Saturn has a version of the SEC and that is why the
ring exists. Its basically a form of securities law. So if we want penetration
we might need a 144A. The other problem is that the alien lifeforms so far
contacted have told our salesforce they'll only buy bearer bonds. So distribution
is slightly tricky. We've been onto head office in New York to see if we
can buy a space rocket - an old Saturn 5 would most probably do - and we're
trying to hire astronauts too.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Rottweiler looks interested but asks about the liquidity. I ensure him that
we'll trade the bond for its lifetime, for sure, and even post a price on
Bloomberg. But just think I say, you're a rare name in the universe, and
the bid outside Earth is bound to be aggressive. We could launch it in Jupiter
time and price it in European time. Blowout. <BR>
<BR>
Everyone looks at Rottweiler to see if he''ll buy it - perhaps the greatest
pitch we've ever made. <BR>
<BR>
<B>B</B>ack to Earth and a fascinating day at Ernst Volkard's squirrel farm
near Woking. These animals, Ernst tells me, bear the closest resemblance
to the investment banker of any known species. They are fiercely independent,
have voracious appetites, and an extraordinary ability to find loopholes
where you'd think they didn't exist. Volkard's Squirrel Range is a university
for many top managers in the capital markets who want to handle their charges
better. <BR>
<BR>
After the short train journey to Woking, and a lunch washed down with claret,
I accompany Volkard onto the range. This consists of netted compounds in
a plantation of hazels and young beech, each containing about a dozen squirrels.
In the middle of the compound is a wooden platform where the client goes
through his tasks. It's an exhilarating sight in the oblique winter sunshine.
Here are men and women at the peak of their profession, concentrating on
persuading these creatures through some simple manoeuvres. Here is Marcel
Ospel, lashing with a horsewhip at some recalcitrant beasts. Some of his
squirrels have burrowed their way through to another compound where Edson
Mitchell has three of them in his lasso. Hitoshi Tonomura is urging his
charges through some difficult indexed hoops with the help of a No 5 iron,
while Alec de Lezardi&egrave;re exhorts his scattered team in several languages.
Do I spy Patrick Stevenson back in the beginner's compound? Next to him
Martin Owen reasons with a pair that are clinging to his trousers. Sir David
Scholey, a former client - here out of pure nostalgia - is apparently happy
to allow the animals to walk all over him. But Volkard leaps into action
as he sees Hansgeorg Hofmann pulling out a snub-nosed Mauser. A discreet
word from him is enough to deter this consummate operator from going too
far. &quot;We don't encourage the use of lethal weapons,&quot; Volkard confides.
&quot;These squirrels are extremely valuable.&quot;

<H3> <B>THE MOORGATE SAGA </B> </H3> <H3> <B>Train at the end of the tunnel</B>
</H3> <P> <B>Salle d'Attentes Deuxi&egrave;me Classe, Gare de Trou-sous-Mer, Pas
de Calais ou d'Argent, France</B>

<P>Dear Mom,


<P> Sitting here in Alastair's waiting room crammed in with 224 other bankers,
all whistling for their money back or preparing to wave it goodbye, I get
overwhelmed by this wave of nostalgia or maybe it is nausea, it carries me back
to a day when I am fresh out of banking college and have my first posting at head
office, licking stamps.

<P> I can see the customer comes in to talk to the V/P who
looks after his account, they shoot the breeze a while and pour some Bourbon, and
then the customer asks the V/P how much he knows about the hog-rearing business,
and the V/P says: Not much, so the customer tells him: Well, learn some more,
you're in it on Monday.

<P> Later on I find out how this feels, I get into all sorts of businesses with
the Last National's money, real estate, naturally, but also all those Boeings in
the Arizona desert, and a tanker fleet until we think to pull the plugs out and
bill Lloyd's of London, and the Casas de los Gatos motel chain in Bulimia we
trade our sovereign debt for, but never until now do I figure to find myself part
owner of the longest and deepest hole ever to have $9 billion poured down it.

<P> It seems a bad idea at the time, which is how I first recall it, a bunch of
stuffed shirts gets awarded this unrepeatable concession to dig their way from
England to France at their own expense, and also from France to England,
apparently they hope to start from both ends and get two tunnels, they send
Morgan Grenfell round to rattle the can for this project, with no takers, which
is where Alastair comes in.

<P> He tells me at the time how this happens, he is sitting in his bank giving
everybody hell, which is his style, when the Governor of the Bank of England
calls him in and taps him, and tells him how the honour of London as a financial
centre is at stake, so he must reach for his bucket and spade and get digging,
and dig for money for a start.

<P> This is like taking candy from a baby, so Alastair says, just pull a face at
the baby and it is too frightened to resist, so he pulls faces at the railroads
and the contractors and of course the banks, and the ferry operators for good
measure, and in no time he has a base of equity and a tower of debt finance built
up on it, our market figures this for a great opportunity, nobody tries to borrow
so much money since Bulimia goes pear-shaped, and I make sure to sign the Last
National up.

<P> So off he goes, boring on the grand scale and pulling more faces all the
time, and topping up with money, never mind what it says in the prospectus, this
project is not exempted from the Law of Estimates, which defines a contractor's
estimate as a sum of money half as great as the project it refers to finally
turns out to cost.

<P> Still at least the guys are digging in the right directions, the two ends
meet in the middle and Alastair has the tunnel fitted out, and railroad tracks
laid down it, and by and by the Queen of England motors thru it in her period
Rolls-Royce, which he loads on a flat bed truck, and this is his big moment and
for us it is the moment when the trouble starts.

<P> We can see all this time his debt is piling up, he borrows
money to pay interest on the interest on his interest, which is OK as far as it
goes, but naturally we figure once he gets the tunnel open he has trains rushing
thru it, and guys on the trains paying fares, and the fares come to us, and one
distant day there may be enough left over to pay dividends, I wish.

<P> This is not what happens, the trains are no shows, some are just late and
some do not work and some are held up by desk jockeys in Brussels who rewrite the
specifications half way thru, by now Alastair is making faces at everyone, he
tells his stockholders he relies on his lawsuits to boost his revenues, they sure
need all the boost they can get and then some, even if he fits them with retro
rockets I still cannot figure how they can accelerate faster than compound
interest.

<P> I smell trouble when old Custer Klesch calls up and bids us for our loan to
Eurotunnel at a discount, this is his big business these days, or so he keeps
telling the blatts, I mention it to Holey Buckett and he figures if the loan is
not worth par the equity must have a minus sign in front of it, he wants
Intergalactic to build up a massive short position but I tell him not to mess on
our own doorstep.

<P> This turns out to be prudent, on account Alastair suddenly switches the
governing law, I am here to stand up for the stockholders, he says, this is an
Anglo-French project, and under the French rules the banks come last, so these
rules are what we play by, and to show I mean it, we shall now stop paying
interest, or stop adding interest back to the principal.

<P> John Melbourn at NatWest is tearing his hair out, he is by way of being the
lead banker on this, the only questions now (he says) are how big a hit we take,
and how much stock we end up with, and whether we can do anything else with this
hole once we own it, such as marketing it as an exceptionally long thin
dolphinarium.

<P> So here all we bankers are, waiting on Alastair, who gives us his post-dated
resignation but says he stays until we see it his way, me, I think of the V/P who
finds himself in the hog-rearing business, just look at the hole we are in, it is
like I tell John, we know the light at the end of the tunnel is an approaching
shuttle train, but what we do not know is whether it is one of ours.

<P> This is not the way I tell it to head office, I say this tunnel is a great
concession which sure as eggs makes a fortune for someone, some day, and how
lucky our bank is to get in below the sea floor, but my plan is to take Alastair
aside and settle for a free pass to Paris for life, much love from

<P> Your submerged son <br>
HERBIE

<P> <B>When he gets to Paris, Herbie lunches at the Brasserie du Nord with
Christopher Fildes </B>

<H3>A EUROMONEY SURVEY - APRIL 1996 </H3>
<H2>
Taiwan's electronic revolution <BR>

</H2>
<H4>
An island powered for success 
The combination of American know-how and Asian can-do has turned Taiwan
into one of the world's leading producers of computer-related electronics.
And, despite the Beijing factor, medium- and long-term prospects are excellent.
But the island needs to raise investment in R&amp;D to stay ahead of the
competition, as Nicholas Bradbury reports </H4>
Taiwan is the world's largest producer of motherboards, monitors and modems.
In 1994, it turned out 7.4 million motherboards - the main printed
circuit boards in computers - while producing 12.7 million monitors
domestically and another 4 million in Taiwanese factories abroad. It holds
a 55% global market share in modems. But it is the manner in which it has
achieved this status that is as impressive as the numbers themselves. <BR>
<BR>
Computers and consumer electronics items traditionally have been made by
large, vertically integrated conglomerates that produce most of the component
parts in-house. Samsung of Korea is a typical example. But such huge manufacturing
structures as the Korean <I>chaebol </I>and the Japanese <I>keiretsu </I>fit
uneasily with Taiwan's Chinese society. The Taiwanese, have disaggregated
the production process, permitting much greater flexibility in production.
While in many areas of industry this can be a severe disadvantage, in electronics
it has benefits. <BR>
<BR>
The structure has reached its apogee in Taiwan in the manufacture of integrated
circuits (ICs), commonly known as computer chips. This process can be split
into four main stages: design, when the circuits for the chips are created;
fabrication, when the circuits are etched with lasers onto wafers of silicon;
packaging, when the individual dies are cut from the wafers and set into
gold-leaf boards, attached to outside connecting pins and bound in a resin
or ceramic; and testing, when the packaged chips are tested before being
sent to the end-user. <BR>
<BR>
Since the mid-1980s, Taiwanese companies have been offering these services
separately. In particular, Taiwan Semiconductor Microelectronics Corporation
(TSMC) became the first company in the world to offer a &quot;foundry&quot;
service for the manufacture of wafers. In its fabrication plants (&quot;fabs&quot;)
in Hsinchu (north-east Taiwan), TSMC can make to order wafers for other
companies. Initially, many of these were integrated manufacturers needing
extra capacity. But there were also increasing numbers of small &quot;fabless&quot;
design houses, which in pre-foundry days, had to leave production to their
potential rivals - the integrated manufacturers. With the invention
of foundries, &quot;fabless&quot; houses boomed. <BR>
<BR>
Taiwan's leap into the new electronic world has created some of the fastest-growing
and most profitable companies ever. In the past two years alone, the Taiwanese
electronics sector has experienced huge earnings growth rates. Peregrine
Securities estimates the industry had net profit growth of 111% in 1995.
Individual companies have registered rates even higher. For example, Orient
Semiconductor Electronics (OSE), one of Taiwan's oldest electronics firms,
is likely to have net profit growth of 266% in 1995 after 487% year-on-year
growth in the first nine months. <BR>
<BR>
The traditional mainstay of the Taiwanese electronics sector is the production
of computer motherboards, with Taiwanese companies providing roughly 80%
of world supplies. Imagine, then, the consternation when mighty Intel, which
dominates production of the CPUs, set up its own motherboard assembly facility
in 1995. Intel was aggrieved by the failure of Taiwanese manufacturers to
upgrade to Pentium-compatible products. <BR>
<BR>
Intel's decision caused analysts to revise downwards Taiwan's domestic motherboard
production to 12 million units, an annual increase of only 5%. Longer term,
the decision could imply that Intel may control the core technology and
input prices. Signs are, however, that Intel has bitten off too much. Observers
speculate that Intel undershot its 1995 sales target of 10 million units
by as much as 30%. Most suggest that Intel's move was an error - motherboard
manufacturing is comparatively labour-intensive with a low profit margin.
The company is trying to scale back its production, which should allow the
Taiwanese to bounce back. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Unlike CPUs, which are standardized, motherboard production requires
close customer relationships as each is tailored to customer specifications,&quot;
says Peter Lin, an analyst at Masterlink Securities. <BR>
<BR>
One major effect of Intel's decision to go into motherboard production was
to create a sudden surge in the prices of motherboard components, especially
ICs. <BR>
<BR>
However, when Intel failed to sell as many motherboards as planned, it dismantled
its stockpile and the chips flooded on to the market. This sudden oversupply
led to a rapid fall in prices. According to Eugene Ha, an analyst at Peregrine,
prices of the currently standard 4-megabyte DRAM have fallen from $13 per
megabyte in the second half of 1995 to $11 now. SRAM prices have crashed:
256k synchronous SRAM prices dropped from $4 to $1.50, while the newer 1-megabyte
SRAMs have fallen from $25 as late as the third quarter of last year to
$6 now. <BR>
<BR>
Sheng-Yui Wang, supervisor of the finance department of United Microelectronics
Corporation (UMC), says: &quot;At $6, 1-megabyte SRAMs are below cost for
some smaller companies or fabless design houses. Many have stopped producing
already&quot;. Opinions differ on whether there will be an oversupply. Makio
Inui, electricals analyst with Dresdner Bank-Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo,
believes that demand growth has exceeded expectations; and even though supply
has beaten many forecasts, he is &quot;not too worried&quot; about oversupply
into next year. &quot;The growth rates might be peaking,&quot; he concedes,
&quot;but, even so, the subsequent profit levels are so huge you have to
invest in them as value stocks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
However, because Taiwan is a relative newcomer to higher-yielding DRAM production,
it will be more affected by the slump in SRAM prices. This will be partly
offset by growth in higher-priced new generation SRAMs and strategic deals
with major end-users; an example is the recent agreement between Winbond
(a leading Taiwan electronics company) and Toshiba. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, SRAM suppliers are viewed cautiously. &quot;SRAMs will experience
a squeeze in 1996,&quot; says Stan Shpetner at Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Securities
Asia in Taipei. &quot;Winbond, which derives 60% of its business from SRAMs,
and which saw earnings growth in 1995 of 300%, is likely to see growth this
year of under 20%.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Even DRAMs may hit difficulties in the medium term. Despite the optimism
of analysts such as Inui, many observers in the region consider an oversupply
possible, beginning in 1997. According to SBC Warburg, there are around
100 new fabricators planned or under construction worldwide. In Taiwan,
several are on the way. Most of these are DRAM facilities which will come
on stream between 1997 and 1998. <BR>
<BR>
In any oversupply, DRAM fabricators will also face a margin squeeze, meaning
there are bound to be some losers. The Koreans, Taiwan's biggest competitors,
are confident that it will not be them. &quot;Korea has a technological
advantage over Taiwan and Japan in DRAMs,&quot; says Jong Park, senior analyst
at LG Securities in Seoul. &quot;Korean companies will have finished their
investment in 16-megabyte DRAMs by the end of 1995 and will be in full production
by 1996, whereas Taiwan won't start until 1997. By then, the Korean companies
will have a yield ratio - meaning the number of viable chips per silicon
wafer - of between 80% and 90%. The Taiwanese will achieve only 70%.
They are four to five years behind.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Shpetner agrees that the Koreans are a big threat. &quot;If I were a Taiwanese
manufacturer,&quot; he comments, &quot;I'd be scared to death of Samsung.
It has aggressive accounting policies that allow it to write off costs over
just one year, which gives it tremendous scope for price-cutting.&quot;
Samsung is reported to have signed five-year forward supply contracts with
six major US computer manufacturers totalling US$65 billion. This means
that it has tied up 15% of the world market up to the year 2000. More recently
Samsung also has done a deal with Intel, thought to be an exclusive <BR>
agreement to supply synchronous DRAMs for the next generation of CPUs, which
will replace the Pentium series. <BR>
<BR>
The Taiwanese may yet withstand the onslaught. &quot;We are not worried
by Samsung,&quot; claims UMC's Wang. &quot;At each stage of production,
Taiwanese companies are 100% more efficient than those in Korea. It is easier
for us to adopt new equipment and technology and we have much quicker decision-making
processes.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Though this smacks of overstatement, the Taiwanese have so far enjoyed significant
margin advantages over rivals, including the Koreans, in IC production.
According to Capital Securities, <BR>
operating profit margins for TSMC and UMC are generally over 40%, about
double that of Samsung and 10 times that of the Japanese. Dixon Ho, analyst
in Taipei for UBS Securities, expects margins to fall to more normal levels
of between 25% and 30%. <BR>
<BR>
Such a level of success reflects a fortuitous occurrence of events. In the
1980s the government focused resources on the electronics industry and set
up the Hsinchu Science Park on a greenfield site south of the capital, Taipei.
Generous tax-breaks were introduced for high-technology companies. Government
institutes were established to carry out the research and development with
which Taiwan's relatively small, family-owned businesses were reluctant
to burden themselves. At the same time, many American-educated Taiwanese
working in the major US companies - Intel, Motorola, IBM - sensed
new opportunities back home amid Taiwan's increasing prosperity and growing
computer industry. <BR>
<BR>
The result was a dynamic mixture of interests. Government research institutes
were corporatized, privatized and taken over by entrepreneurs, both home-grown
and with experience in the US. UMC, for example, one of the leading local
integrated-circuit producers, was spun off from the government's Electronics
Research and Service Organization. Its major shareholders are the state-run
Chiao Tung Bank and the ministry of economic affairs, as well as two listed
private companies, Teco Electric &amp; Machinery and Yao Hua Glass. <BR>
<BR>
However, the big problem facing Taiwanese stocks is Beijing's refusal to
to recognize Taiwan as an independent state and to regard the island as
anything other than an integral part of the People's Republic. Tensions
have heightened greatly since Beijing began test-firing missiles from the
mainland into waters provocatively close to Taiwanese shores last summer.
Last month's resumption of testing and subsequent naval and air manoeuvres,
bringing the US navy rushing to the area, hardly helped further the cause
of Taiwanese stocks. Price/earnings (p/e) ratios of the island's technology
stocks are in the range of 11 times earnings, lower than those of many counterparts
in other markets. <BR>
<BR>
Both investors and electronics companies are keen for a relaxation of tensions
to allow the Taiwanese stock market to recover from its current slump. And
the companies need to raise cash to finance new facilities in their highly
capital-intensive industry. But apart from the political tensions, there
would appear little downside. In its September 1995 review of the global
semiconductors industry, Morgan Stanley forecast robust demand and slapped
on the front page as a sub-title: <I>Taiwan: explosive growth to continue</I>.
<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, in recent months some caution has crept in among industry
observers. Fundamentally, there are fears of lower PC sales and of an impending
global oversupply in semiconductors. &quot;In this type of industry, low
p/e ratios are not necessarily attractive,&quot; explains Terry Wou, assistant
fund manager at Thornton Asset Management in Hong Kong. &quot;They mean
that the earnings are already huge. It indicates a time to sell.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Longer term, no-one expects anything but growth for the electronics sector.
But there will be a shift in emphasis from consumer-electronic products
towards more computer-based products. &quot;The main challenge to the consumer-electronics
industry is that most of its mainstay products will eventually disappear,&quot;
reports SBC Warburg's 1996 Technology Outlook. &quot;The soon-to-be ubiquitous
PC with its on-line connection and CD-ROM capability is likely to replace
TVs...audios and VCRs...video-game machines...and ultimately even DVD (digital
video-disk).&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There is ample room for expansion of PC sales worldwide. Global penetration
of the market stands at only 4%. (The highest penetration by country is
the 36%, measured by PC per person, registered in the US). Even many countries
with a high per-capita GDP have low PC sales, especially in Asia. New systems
that make Chinese and Japanese character inputting easier to manage should
help to narrow this gap, making Asia the fastest growing market for the
next few years. <BR>
<BR>
Morgan Stanley's review of semiconductors puts global PC sales growth at
20% in 1996 and 17% compounded to 2000. But many are questioning whether
growth will be so vigorous and the <BR>
industry had a very poor fourth quarter in 1995. This is attributed to the
failure of Microsoft Corporation's Windows 95 software to meet sales expectations.
Christmas retail sales in the US were disappointing and many corporations
have not yet upgraded to Pentium-based machines and instead seem to have
been waiting for the just-launched Intel P6 microprocessor, which is designed
to run specifically with the Windows NT operating system. <BR>
<BR>
Yipin Lee, director of corporate finance and investment management at Acer
Incorporated, Taiwan's premier computer manufacturer, forecasts a 15% rise
in global PC sales this year, while Lin at Masterlink Securities in Taipei
says: &quot;Global PC growth should be in the range of 15% to 20% in 1996,
hitting a sales volume of 67 million units. Sales growth should stabilize
thereafter, reaching 100 million units by 2000. This is much later than
Intel's original 1998 best-case sales estimate of 100 million units.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
This is clearly not the best news for computer manufacturers, but it is
not very bad news either. Profit growth will slacken. Capital Securities
Corporation, a Taipei-based brokerage house, estimates that 1995 revenues
for Acer were NT$52.5 billion ($1.9 billion), up 58% year-on-year. Its forecast
for 1996 revenue growth is a still-healthy 33%. <BR>
<BR>
The reason for relatively robust profits is the falling price of microchips,
one of the main cost components in computers. In the short term this should
permit computer manufacturers to <BR>
maintain margins. In the medium term, they will be able to pass on these
lower component prices to consumers, which should give a great boost to
sales. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The advent of a $1,000 machine capable of running powerful software
is not far away,&quot; says Acer's Lee. &quot;This will give a tremendous
lift to computer sales around the world.&quot;At the <BR>
higher end of the market, meanwhile, companies and individuals will upgrade
machines to cope with the demands of ever-increasing memory-eating software.
<BR>
<BR>
In some ways, Taiwan's computer makers are less likely than others to suffer
in the event of lower sales. Taiwan accounts for only a little over 8% of
world shipments of desktop computers but about 28% of portables. Growth
in portables is forecast to outpace that of desktops significantly. Prices
of thin-film transistor liquid crystal display screens, which represent
about 40% of the cost of notebooks (portables), fell by 37% at the end of
1995. Technical advances mean that CD-ROMs can now be fitted. Dataquest,
a specialist research firm, predicts that this will enhance portable sales
by 35% in 1996. <BR>
<BR>
If the performance of the computer, motherboard and IC manufacturers looks
mixed, that of the packaging and testing sector is generally strong. The
largest IC packager in the world is Anam of Korea, but Taiwan has a vibrant
sector led by world number two Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE),
world number three Siliconware Precision Industries Limited and OSE. <BR>
<BR>
Packaging services are in great demand worldwide. Order books are full and
likely to remain so for some time. But it is a relatively labour-intensive
activity and has lower profit margins than chip production. ASE assistant
vice-president Jeffrey Chen estimates that each $100 of capital invested
in fabrication produces around $100 in revenues and $50 of profit. Packaging,
by contrast, <BR>
produces $200 in revenues but only $36 in profits. <BR>
<BR>
As revenues come under pressure, integrated manufacturers will move to outsource
packaging to a greater degree than now. Dataquest (a sector analyst) forecasts
that independent IC packaging will increase from 17% of the current packaging
market to 40% by 1998 - compound annual growth rate over the period
of 43%. Unlike fabrication plants, which have long lead-times, <BR>
packaging plants are quick to set up. Therefore they can respond to demand
much more easily than fabs, leading to less volatile earnings. &quot;Risk
is lower than the upstream side but packaging still carries great upside
potential,&quot; says Chitung Liu, associate director of equitiy research
at SBC Warburg in Taipei. &quot;Since packagers are expanding slower than
fabs, there will continue to be a capacity shortage.&quot; <BR>

Regional fund managers and brokers recommend packaging companies as solid
buys. &quot;Ninety per cent of chips are packaged in the Far East,&quot;
says Chen of ASE, &quot;but they are typically shipped to the US -
where they were designed - for testing and then shipped back to the
Far East for assembly.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But price pressures are forcing change and testing is beginning to move
out of the US and into Taiwan. Testing is capital-intensive, like fabrication,
yet is even less profitable (measured by return on equity) than packaging.
The same $100 that produced profits of $36 in packaging would produce profits
of only $20 in testing, on revenues of $65. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to savings, outsourcing testing to Taiwan should enhance computer
manufacturers' efficiency. &quot;The product life-cycle is now so short,
only six to nine months, that it makes no sense to ship to the US and back
again,&quot; says Chen. Companies such as ASE are therefore offering turnkey
services where packaging and testing are carried out at the same site. <BR>
<BR>
Chen estimates that testing will grow at a rate about 50% more than packaging.
&quot;Our unlisted testing subsidiary, ASE Test, has seen earnings growth
in excess of 100% for the past three years,&quot; he says. &quot;It will
continue to grow very fast and our plan is to seek an overseas listing -
a sub-IPO [initial public offering] of ASE Inc.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In looking to the next several years, Taiwan's electronics industry appears
to be set along a course of continuing expansion at a rate faster than the
global industry. Morgan Stanley expects Taiwan to expand its market share
of ICs from 5.6% in 1994 to 7% by 2000. <BR>
<BR>
But there are challenges which could stifle some of the industry's growth
if not promptly addressed. One is cost. Lower-end production will continue
to move to other parts of Asia. Acer already manufactures in the Philippines
and Malaysia and ASE imports 20% of its workforce from the Philippines.
<BR>
<BR>
A more critical area is research and development (R&amp;D). &quot;There
is a lack of commitment to R&amp;D on the part of Taiwanese companies,&quot;
complains Elizabeth Sun, vice-president of the <BR>
international department of Capital Securities in Taipei. &quot;They typically
budget less than 10%. In a fast-changing industry such as electronics, this
means Taiwan will always be a follower.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Sun's colleague, senior associate Chris Hsieh, feels that the strategic
alliances being forged by the major industry players, such as those between
Samsung, NEC and Intel, also pose a threat. While Taiwanese companies have
also been forging alliances, their lower technology levels could leave them
with less bargaining power. <BR>
<BR>
If Taiwan continues to lag in technology, its electronics industry will
depend on squeezing even more efficiency out of the manufacturing process.
Thus far, it has achieved wonders. But the <BR>
economic miracle will be harder to sustain in the longer term. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H4>Fab time at the foundry </H4>
Taiwan Semiconductor Microelectronics Corporation (TSMC) is the only make-to-order
electronics &quot;foundry&quot; company in Taiwan - known as fabs -
for silicon wafers used in the integrated circuits of computers. And business
is booming. <BR>
<BR>
With growing numbers of design houses without fabrication facilities (&quot;fabless&quot;)
the reliance on foundry production is increasing. But, the high capital
costs involved in the construction of fabrication (foundry) plants -
about $1 billion - mean that integrated manufacturers are increasingly
contracting out portions of their production to foundries. As a result,
many companies are climbing on to the TSMC-led bandwagon. <BR>
<BR>
As demand for DRAMs, which provide memory storage in a computer's CPU, is
expected to outpace general demand for semiconductors, foundry production
is forecast to grow faster than IC production generally. <BR>
<BR>
The response to declining margins of many companies which concentrated on
the manufacture of SRAMs, which help to speed passage of information, has
been to build DRAM foundry fabrication plants. United Microelectronics Corporation
(UMC) has three joint-venture foundries planned and under construction,
in conjunction with 10 - mainly US - partners. And the lucrative
foundry business has led to a number of Taiwanese companies from very different
areas of activity to get in on the act - Nan Ya Plastics being one
of the most high-profile. <BR>
<BR>
Newcomers will need to establish a reputation for consistent high-quality
production. To achieve this they will have to attract sufficient numbers
of engineers - and these professionals now come at a considerable premium
in Taiwan. Engineers are attracted to companies through huge stock bonuses,
but new companies - of necessity unlisted - cannot offer the same
incentives. As a result, they may suffer from skill shortages or have to
make huge cash payments that will hurt the bottom line. <BR>
<BR>
Many investors are unaware that the stock bonuses given by firms may be
affecting company profits. Under Taiwan's accounting rules, such payments
do not pass through the accounts. Fabs typically pay about 10% of net income
in stock bonuses. If listed companies overall make NT$10 billion in one
year, or NT$9 billion after legal reserves, this level of stock bonuses
accounts for NT$900 million, which at a par value of NT$10 per share makes
90 million shares. At average actual share-price levels, this translates
into NT$5.4 billion. This would reduce net profits to NT$4.6 billion, in
turn doubling the average p/e ratio. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H4>China factor threatens fundraising opportunities </H4>
The Taiwanese banking sector has warmed to high-tech companies and their
strong cash-flows. The main players regularly raise funds through syndicated
loans, at fine pricing. Last November, for example, Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering (ASE) got a $100 million five-year loan at Libor plus 65 basis
points (bp). United Microelectronic Corporation's (UMC) first joint-venture
fabrication plant, into which shareholders have injected $600 million in
equity, has recently signed a two-tranche seven-year loan of $260 million
priced at Sibor plus 75bp and NT$500 million at prime plus 50bp. However,
financial avenues are opening as more companies in the industry begin to
list on the Taipei exchange. <BR>
<BR>
Rights issues by listed companies, such as the NT$6 billion issue from Winbond
(one of Taiwan's largest electronics companies) recently digested by the
market, are becoming increasingly common. As well as ASE, most larger high-tech
firms have plans to list subsidiaries, to diversify funding sources and
to pay stock bonuses. Acer Incorporated, Taiwan's leading computer producer,
has an ambitious plan to list all of its 21 subsidiaries worldwide. <BR>
<BR>
GDR (Global Depositary Receipt) and ADR (American Depositary Receipt) issues
have occurred, but success has tempered by market tension. For example,
Morgan Stanley, CS First Boston and SBC Warburg led a July 1995 issue of
8.6 million GDRs (representing 43 million shares) for ASE, which raised
$131 million. But investors have not been smiling - the market is down
due to tensions with China. &quot;We launched the issue just two weeks before
the [last summer's] Chinese missile tests,&quot; explains Jeffrey Chen,
assistant vice president of ASE. &quot;But our company has outperformed
estimated revenues and net income; and while now below the issue price the
stock is trading at a premium to the market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, UMC planned a $500 million GDR issue last year. But this has
been postponed to later this year, and many believe that it will become
a convertible bond (CB) instead. Indeed, this could be the new trend, with
CBs becoming flavour of the year for Taiwanese electronics companies. &quot;As
interest rates decline around the world, CBs will become more attractive,&quot;
says UBS Securities analyst Dixon Ho. <BR>
<BR>
Taiwanese CBs have been sensibly priced, with reasonable coupons and put
options. The great snag has been that they have not been convertible. But
this has now changed - nearly. Central bank regulations now permit
conversion, with the only hurdle being the actual method of conversion.
&quot;We are now working with the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission]
and the central bank on the exact mechanism,&quot; says Yipin Lee, director
of corporate finance at Acer. &quot;We expect this process to be finished
shortly, which may mean that we will hold a bondholders' meeting.&quot;
Acer issued a US$45 million 10-year Euro convertible in 1991. The bond carried
a 4% coupon with a 7% put, but the CB has a conversion price of NT$20 against
a current stock price of around NT$60. It is easy to see the potential for
capital raising which the transformation of these instruments from debt
to quasi-equity would unleash. <BR>
<BR>
The first CB of the year, a proposed<B> </B>$250 million seven-year issue
by Winbond, is about to be priced in New York. It may be a little unfortunate
as a test-case. Although the company is Taiwan's third largest IC maker,
but is thought by analysts to be one of the most vulnerable to a margin
squeeze. And worries over China persist. The bookrunners, SBC Warburg and
Salomon Brothers, as well as local underwriter Capital Securities Company,
will have to get the pricing absolutely right if the issue is to go smoothly.

<P> <B>A SUPPLEMENT TO EUROMONEY/AUGUST 1996</B>

<H3> Egypt: facing the modern world<br>Investment jewel on the Nile </H3> <H4> <B>After a number of false starts, Egypt &#173; among the best
performers in the emerging markets &#173; is
undertaking major economic reform. But despite a
diverse economy and sound macroeconomic indicators, foreign aid still
outstrips foreign investment in the country. 
<br>Nigel Ash reports</B> </H4> 

<P> When the new Egyptian government set to work this
January, it began &#173; like most of its predecessors &#173; by announcing a
raft of reforms. The markets had heard such pronouncements many times since the
principle of economic reform was first established in 1990 and real steps were
taken to liberalize prices, abolish subsidies and controls on foreign exchange
and capital, and move towards liberalized interest rates. After four months
virtually nothing had changed and the administration of premier Kamal el-Ganzouri
was being written off.

<P> Then in April something happened that galvanized the government. During a
visit to Sharm El Sheikhin Sinai, president Hosni Mubarak was asked by a TV
interviewer how he would judge the success of his new government. Turning to
Ganzouri, with what one local banker described as "a significant look", the
president replied: "By the speed with which it pushes through the economic reform
programme."

<P> Since then, hardly a Wednesday cabinet meeting has taken place without a
welter of legislative changes seizing the headlines in the next day's newspapers.
Many of these &#173; such as allowing limited foreign ownership of land &#173;
have been executive orders based on existing but never implemented legislation.
Other recent changes include permitting foreign partners to own more than 49% of
joint venture banks and the abolition of a cumbersome 2% capital gains tax on
stock market transactions.

<P> The perception is that after many false starts the Egyptian economy finally
is moving away from the dead hand of Nasserite state planning. "The story has
suddenly become very positive," says Ahmed Elbardai, vice-president of Citibank.
"The decisions being made are very conducive to business and this is filtering
down to organizations like the Capital Markets Authority."

<P> Big global players are also turning bullish, led by Merrill Lynch which this
June issued research describing Egypt as "the investment jewel on the Nile".
There is even talk of the government applying for a sovereign rating: this could
be delivered in November when Cairo hosts the third gathering of the increasingly
prestigious Middle East and North African economic summit.

<P> According to one of its advisers, the Ganzouri administration is anxious to
reach agreement with the IMF over the Extended Fund Facility. This has been held
up since 1993 by disputes over adjustment policies, including the slow pace of
privatization and what the IMF believed was the overvalued Egyptian pound. If, as
is now expected, an agreement is put in place before the end of this year, the
Paris Club will write off the last $4 billion of a debt relief programme worth
$10.6 billion.

<P> The macroeconomics mostly look good. For the last 15 years Egypt has managed
to exploit its pivotal political position in the Middle East to secure a steady
flow of aid &#173; mainly from the United States and the Gulf States &#173; in
addition to debt forgiveness. The aid flows that followed the 1979 Camp David
peace accord with Israel enabled Egypt to avoid major structural reforms urged by
the IMF and World Bank. In 1990 Egypt's prominent role in the Arab forces in the
Gulf War against Iraq attracted more aid and let the government off the hook once
again. Aid is still running at around $4 billion a year but, unless the
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal breaks down, the country will have to attract
funds on a commercial &#173; not a political &#173; basis.

<P> In 1994 foreign investment totalled just $400 million. Yet foreign capital
inflows are seen as essential, because domestic savings and investment represent
no more than 17% of GDP, well below the minimum of 25% thought necessary to
achieve sustained growth.

<P> However, over the past five years, Egypt has increased its foreign exchange
reserves by almost $11 billion to some $16.2 billion at the end of 1995,
representing around 11 months of import cover and five times the current annual
debt service obligations. From a peak of $41 billion in 1988, equal to 590% of
goods and services exports, total external debt has been reduced to $28.5
billion. Servicing this has cost an average of $3.3 billion a year since 1993.

<P> This has given the Central Bank the flexibility to defend the exchange rate
on the internally-convertible Egyptian pound and to trim inflation steadily: from
11% in 1993 to 8.4% last year. This year it is on target for 7%.

<P> Gross domestic product increased by just 0.5% in 1993, by 4% last year and is
expected to rise by 4.5% this year. However, this is tempered by the 2% annual
population growth which, although declining slightly, still brings half a million
new job seekers to the job market every year and requires minimum GDP growth of
4.5% to absorb them. On a practical level, the authorities will lose the ability
to create jobs in state industries as the government's privatization programme
finally picks up steam. Meanwhile, until there is a relaxation of the strict
labour laws, private companies will be reluctant to hire.

<P> In state sector industries, which still dominate the economy, it is estimated
that "under-employment" runs at around 30%, but many government workers
supplement their pay with second jobs &#173; often in the service sector. Given
the large unofficial economy and widespread tax evasion, unemployment may not be
so bad. (Official figures indicate 17% unemployment.)

<P> However with per capita income at $600 per annum, there is widespread
poverty, especially in the crowded run-down suburbs of Cairo. The consequent
social pressures have resulted in an increase in religious fundamentalism, and
extremist groups have mounted terrorist attacks in recent years &#173;
principally against tourist targets, but also against intellectuals and Israelis.

<P> Egypt has a diverse economy. Revenues from the service sector, including
tourism and the Suez Canal, accounted for 51.5% of GDP in the 1991-1992 financial
year. Industry produced another 18.3%, while agriculture &#173; a third of the
labour force still work on the limited but highly productive land around the Nile
and its delta &#173; contributed a further 16.5%. Hydrocarbons accounted for 10%
and gas is replacing petroleum as the main energy source, thereby freeing crude
production for export.

<P> Prudent spending by the last government meant that the fiscal deficit was
some E&#163;3 billion ($884 million), or 1.7% of GDP, in the year to June 1996.
Expenditure was contained at just below 8.3%. In line with IMF demands, import
tariffs were reduced, but the government managed to offset the loss with
higher-than-expected earnings from the Suez Canal and increased receipts from
stamp duty.

<P> As Merrill Lynch notes in its enthusiastic research: "This fiscal outcome
places Egypt among the best performers in the emerging markets of east Europe,
Middle East and Africa &#173; second only to the Czech Republic."

<P> The new government's budget was drafted before the 2% capital gains tax was
abolished on stock market transactions. It proposes an expenditure of E&#163;77.4
billion, an increase of 8.3% over last year. Although observers believe the
deficit will increase, they are expecting it to remain below 2% of GDP. A major
budget item is social spending, which reflects the government's concern over
social unrest among the poor. Subsidies on sugar, oil and wheat flour &#173;
subsidized bread costs the government around $1.2 billion a year &#173; remain in
force. Privatization revenue, which could amount to E&#163;27 billion, will be
used to reduce the outstanding liabilities of state sector companies &#173;
currently estimated at E&#163;70 billion &#173; says the government.

<P> The Central Bank's standing has risen, thanks to its successful negotiations
with the IMF over both the valuation of the Egyptian pound and the actual total
of Egypt's external debt, which a senior Egyptian source says had been
overcalculated by almost $6 billion.

<P> Both the World Bank and the IMF had long held the position that the Egyptian
currency was overvalued by up to 30% and that the effectively fixed exchange rate
which the Central Bank maintained was harmful to exports and encouraged imports.
At one point the IMF made devaluation a core requirement for further borrowings
under its Extended Fund Facility.

<P> The Central Bank argued that the majority of the country's foreign exchange
earnings came from tourism, Suez Canal revenues, workers' remittances and oil
sales, and that they were denominated in US dollars and unaffected by local
exchange rate movements. Devaluation would therefore have little effect on
foreign exchange earnings, but would push up the cost of imports, especially
capital goods. It would also, through the higher cost of food subsidies, impact
directly on the budget. At the end of last year, the IMF backed down on the
point.

<H3> Re-evaluating the stock market </H3> 
<H4> <B>An ambitious privatization programme is set to boost
foreign investment and encourage domestic institutional investment in Egypt's
stock market</B> </H4> 

<P> "There has been more change in the markets in the last five months than there has been in the last five years," says stockbroker Aladdin
Saba, co-founder of Hermes Financial, which was merging this July with the other
leading Cairo stockbroker, Egyptian Financial Group (EFG). The new company, EFG
Hermes, will have a market share of 30%.

<P> The active minority among the 110 registered stockbrokers views the link-up
of the two strongest players with some alarm. The consolation for them is that,
because in-house broking is forbidden, they may now pitch for the brokerage
business of the EFG and Hermes fund management operations, which used to trade
through each other. (The fund management operations of the two companies remain
separate.)

<P> "The main change on the Cairo Stock Exchange is that there is no longer a
liquidity problem," explains Saba. "Volumes have grown quite significantly in the
past year &#173; and dramatically so if you start from 1993 when trades averaged
240,000 a day. Last year the figure was 3.1 million, and to May this year we were
averaging 5.8 million daily. The June figures are going to be much higher and it
is significant that these latest figures don't include new issues, which have to
be traded for three months before they are included in the index. And we are due
to have more public offerings before the year is out."

<P> Despite improved liquidity, analysts accept that there is still a lack of
product on the Cairo Stock Exchange. Out of the 745 listed companies, only 172
are ever traded and only 40 actively traded. The exchange also boasts a five-year
government bond issued in 1995 and a handful of corporate bonds, including a
first Pharaoh bond &#173; a E&#163;200 million FRN (floating rate note) for
Citibank which was 2.5 times oversubscribed during the mandatory 10-day offer
period.

<P> Until this year, many of the privatizations had been very small deals
involving only 10% of equity, says Saba. "This was not, in truth, privatization.
It was merely taking money into the public sector." When the privatization agency
announced this May that 10% of Medinet Nasr Housing and Construction was to be
sold off, it looked like another unappetizing offer. Then, to the market's
surprise, the government did an about-face and said that it would sell 75% of the
equity.

<P> "This was a momentous decision," says Saba. "It meant that for the first time
in a public share offering, the control of a company was really going to the
private sector. With the sale, the board was privatized and this now looks like
an excellent little company. The stock was offered at E&#163;65 and is now
trading at E&#163;91. I think the government was as impressed by what happened as
we were. The challenge now is to keep the momentum going. Since Nasr, there have
been a few other deals, including Starch and Glucose in which a 60% stake was
sold as originally planned. However, we need more to prove that privatization is
a success, and that the private sector is up to the challenge of buying and
running these assets profitably."

<P> Until the Nasr deal, the government's programme to sell 314 fully-owned
public enterprises with a book value of around E&#163;85 billion had been moving
slowly. After private placements of three companies, including Egyptian Bottling
(PepsiCo) and El-Nasr Bottling (Coca Cola), only five enterprises had been fully
<BR> privatized and 17 minority holdings sold.

<P> "One of the problems has been that all these state companies were parcelled
out among holding companies on a sectoral basis," explains a local banker. "This
was ostensibly to have them converted into joint stock companies in readiness for
their sale. This has indeed been done &#173; far better by some holding companies
than others &#173; but virtually all the managers in both the holding companies
and the companies that have been passed into their control are bureaucrats or
technicians. There is hardly a business brain among them. And like all officials,
they never like to relinquish any little piece of power they have unless they are
forced to. It is probably more serious for them, since once their company is sold
off they will probably find themselves out of a job."

<P> The Ganzouri government aims to sell off 80 companies involved in steel,
cement, fertilizers and textiles before the end of the year. Mohamed Ozalp,
senior general manager at MIBank (Misr International Bank), whose latest
privatization was a 10% stake in the El Nasr Transformers and Electrical Products
Company (Elmaco), says there are still investors with money prepared to buy into
new products.

<P> "The last time I saw the Central Bank figures," says Ozalp, "liquidity stood
at E&#163;160 billion &#173; E&#163;62 billion of which was household sector
deposits in the banking system &#173; and it is estimated that there is
approximately $40 billion of Egyptian funds abroad, either in the form of flight
capital or of workers' remittances which have been kept out of the country. If a
small proportion of this money comes into the stock market, it will make a
definite impact."

<P> Ozalp's own bank underwent a partial privatization when Banque Misr sold 10%
of MIBank's shares. He comments: "There appears to be greater commitment now than
two years ago when there was a recommendation that public sector ownership of
joint venture banks be decreased to a maximum holding of 20% before the end of
1996. Since then there has been much talk and statements of intent, but only one
move of major significance transpired. That exception was the Commercial
International Bank (CIB), where the National Bank of Egypt, which owned 100% of
the bank, proceeded to sell 56% to individuals, employees and private corporate
investors. Today CIB'S shares are among the most actively traded in the Egyptian
stock market."

<P> CIB went on to become the first internationally-listed Egyptian security when
one million shares in the form of GDRS, representing 25% of the equity, were
placed by a consortium led by Barings.

<P> With the exception of investment funds, which represent perhaps 8% of the
market with some E&#163;2 billion under management, domestic institutional
investors are notable by their absence. The insurance sector, dominated by three
state companies which account for 75% of all business, in 1994 generated a
premium income of only E&#163;1.5 billion &#173; less than 1% of GDP. This is
partly because premiums are still not fully liberalized and partly because
policies are generally sold only when there is a legal requirement for them: most
Egyptians have yet to recognize the benefits of standard insurance products.

<P> Until earlier this year, the insurance companies were limited to placing no
more than 15% of their assets in securities. This has now been raised to 30%.
Ahmed Heikal, director of the Egyptian Fund Management Group, points out,
however, that the insurance companies' assets are hugely undervalued: if property
in the centre of Cairo, still accounted at book value, was to be revalued, they
would have substantially more to invest in securities.

<P> The local investment funds have not all had an easy time. From a high in
March 1995, the Hermes Financial Index (HFI) has been in gentle but inexorable
retreat. The mainly open-ended funds have been hit by redemptions as investors
have sought more robust investments. Egyptian dividends have always tended to be
high: Khalil Nougaim, managing director of Cairo Funds Management, points out
that while the market has an average p/e of seven, some Egyptian shares are
having to pay dividends of up to 12%.

<P> Saba is philosophical about working in a gently sliding market. "I think that
it was very healthy that we had a collapse in prices. Certainly, it created
disillusionment for a lot of investors, but not enough to kill the market. People
pulled back but, since the Nasr  deal, they have started to return because they
think something different is happening. I think privatization is going to
continue and this market is going to be totally different within a year from now.
I think that it is going to go up by at least 30%. The value is going to go
through the roof and when the central depository comes on stream by next January,
settlement is going to improve dramatically."

<P> It is the undervaluation of the Egyptian market that is attracting foreign
investors, who can be responsible for up to 35% to 40% of daily volumes.
(International investors accounted for 20% of the E&#163;3.3 billion of stock
traded on the Cairo Stock Exchange in the first six months of this year, compared
with 6% of the E&#163;3.8 billion traded in the whole of last year.) "I have a
nice feeling in terms of foreign investors," says Aly el Tahry, co-founder of
Hermes Financial, "but it may be a little too early."

<P> He says he will welcome a sovereign rating for Egypt, whatever it is. "Even
if it came out below investment grade it would not be negative. There are still
quite a few investors who would like to know where they are, and the rating will
fix the price. Both the government and investors would know where their benchmark
is."

<H3> Banking opportunities </H3> 
<H4> <B>With foreign banks free to trade in local currency, Egyptian banks will have to reform rapidly to compete</B> </H4> 

<P> Since interest rates were liberalized, Egyptian banks have been scrambling for
good assets. There are few genuine blue-chip borrowers; these, together with the
next best risks, make up a relatively small market of little more than 400 firms
with sales of over $20 million.

<P> Analysts point out that the banking system now has a serious funds mismatch.
Between 80% and 85% of deposits are for less than three months, and only 5% of
these on average are free.

<P> However, wholesale credits are being extended to five or six years. A recent
five-year loan to the local franchise of an international bottling company
carried a one-year grace period and a first-year rate that was effectively 1%.
"The name will look good, but it is not a good deal," says an analyst. "These
low-earning loans have been going on for two years now. They are neither good for
the banks in the short term nor the customers in the long term."

<P> There is also disquiet among some brokers that banks have been investing in
the shares of some of their borrowers, raising the possibility that they are
using inside information to shape their investment strategies.

<P> "One problem is that the system lacks non-bank financial institutional
players as a source of long-term funding," says Omar Mohanna, who has just taken
over as general manager of the Egypt Arab African Bank. "The pension funds are
still out of the system because their funds go primarily to the National
Investment Bank and don't find their way to the capital market. Meanwhile, the
insurance companies are only now becoming more active in the capital markets.
They remain in property and classic hedges. Without these two main sources it is
very difficult to create a long-term source of funding."

<P> Some bankers argue that the Egyptian banking system is over-banked, while
others maintain that this applies only to wholesale business. The winnowing
process has already begun: there are now 81 banks, 20 fewer than two years ago.
Others in the market point out that lower-capitalized banks may face problems
that will propel them into mergers.

<P> "There will be mergers and acquisitions, and restructurings," says Ahmed
Elbardai, vice-president at Citibank. "Banks are trying to improve their
efficiency but, inevitably, it is the private banks that are doing better because
they are newer, have built-in controls and have avoided a build-up of
non-performing debt. And a lot of them have joint venture experience with a
foreign bank."

<P> Until two years ago foreign banks could only access the local currency market
as part of a joint venture bank. Now that they can compete on equal terms, they
are likely to expand from the bread-and-butter, trade-related wholesale work into
the retail market. "Citibank has been successful here for 20 years," says
Elbardai. "And now we are free to deal in local currency, we wish to become a
significant retail bank with a market share of about 5%. We already have 4,000
personal banking clients."

<P> The retail sector is currently dominated by the big four state banks &#173;
National Bank of Egypt, Banque Misr, Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria
&#173; and is seriously underdeveloped. A recent study by Salomon brothers
concluded that, in 1994, Egypt had a banking density of 48,000 customers per
branch down from 79,000 four years earlier. This is still well behind other
Mediterranean markets and the report concludes: "Egypt's cash society is the
cause of the low banking density. Cheques and credit cards are not commonly
used."

<P> The interbank market is now well developed and in the last 18 months it has
become more active, with banks no longer afraid to go short. The net lenders are
the four big banks, and volumes range between E&#163;200 million and E&#163;300
million a day.

<P> The foreign exchange market is more delicate and can be affected artificially
because banks are allowed to hold positions only up to 10% of their equity. The
excess must be sold on to the market. One dealing room manager comments: "We can
do swaps or forwards. Counterparties are OK on spots and some understand
forwards, which are all that is allowed and only for a client who has an
underlying commercial transaction. We hope, however, that as the market becomes
more experienced, the pressure will mount for a liberalization of the rules."

<H3> Making foreign investment
hassle-free </H3> 
<H4> <B>Investing in Egypt is getting easier and
some big name funds are moving in, tempted by
modest liberalization and good rewards</B> </H4>

<P> Egypt's market participants regularly cite the billions of dollars of
investment attracted by one south-east Asian country or another and then point
morosely to the $400 million that Egypt has been attracting each year since 1993.
Relatively few direct investors have chosen this country of 60 million people as
their regional manufacturing base despite its large home market and excellent
geographical location. Certain sectors, such as textiles and, recently,
value-added agricultural products are an exception, but the general feeling is
that the big money is still waiting.

<P> The fast-track investment agencies designed to help an investor set up a deal
were recently described as part of the problem by a local businessman: "The very
fact that these organizations have some legal right to take you in hand means
that, in fact, they become just another level of bureaucracy for you to deal
with. Some people who arrived eager to invest had very bad experiences and months
later pulled out angrily."

<P> Aly Wally, a former government minister who is now a senior member of the
board of the Egyptian Businessmen's Association, a pressure group of leading
executives, says: "The new government appears to be listening to the markets.
They are, of course, getting a lot of suggestions. I believe that in order to
bring in major flows of foreign investment we need to cut corporate tax from 50%
to 22%, extend and broaden the tax breaks that already exist for outside
investors, replace our Napoleonic commercial code with something modern and
workable, and make sure that the role of the government dwindles so that it is
becomes only a helping hand for the economy, not the controlling hand."

<P> By contrast, overseas indirect investment has become largely  hassle-free,
not least because of the removal of the 2% capital gains tax. There are no limits
on the amount that may be invested, its convertibility into and out of the local
currency, or the timing of an investment. Only when a single investor is buying
more than 20% of a company's stock is an official notification necessary.

<P> "The money that came in last year from overseas was from the daring foreign
investor," says Ahmed Elbardai, vice-president at Citibank. "Now we are seeing
the big-name funds coming in, perhaps for their own investors rather than their
own portfolios. I don't believe they will come in, take one bite of the cherry
and then leave, because the potential is so much greater now... You have a market
today that is giving you a yield of around 10%, which is equal to the high
interest rates, and which is selling at a multiple of between six and seven,
which is very low. With a stable exchange rate, I do not think you can go wrong."
Elbardai reckons that 19% of the new transactions in the second quarter of 1996
were foreign.

<P> Now that Egypt's macroeconomics are under control, it is an outstanding
candidate for international funds that are focused on Africa and the Middle East.
"If they look around, outside of Morocco and maybe Tunisia," says Elbardai,
"there is not much for them to put their money in."

<P> Earlier this year HSBC's James Capel launched the first offshore closed-end
fund for Egyptian equities. When the Egyptian Stock Exchange (ESE) joins the
IFC's emerging market index next year, it is expected that many fund managers
will start adding the ESE to their emerging market risk. A Pharaoh bond for
Citibank was followed by another in May for the Egyptian American Bank, a joint
venture between the Bank of Alexandria and American Express. Several merchant
banks have been trying to market IPOs or bonds to corporates that have
traditionally relied upon bank money or their own resources for expansion. One
house believes that it is close to selling Egypt's first convertible, but is
being delayed by regulatory deliberations.

<P> The detailed financial and operational analyses being prepared for the
privatization of state assets also appear to be setting a standard for
disclosure. Brokers, noting that companies are now happier to welcome analysts,
have begun actively to seek research on them.

<B>DEAL INSIDER - PETER LEE </B>
</H4>
<H2>
<B>Gazprom overcomes investors' doubts</B>
</H2>
<P>
<B>Issuer: Gazprom</B>

<P>
<B>Amount: $430 million</B>

<P>
<B>Launched: October 21, 1996</B>

<P>
<B>Global coordinators: Morgan Stanley</B>

<P>
<B>and Kleinwort Benson</B>

<P>
Joint global co-ordinators Morgan Stanley and Kleinwort Benson scored a considerable success last month by leading the largest international equity offering by a Russian company, a $430 million sale of stock in giant gas group Gazprom.

<P>
A deal has been in the works for well over two years, with Kleinwort Benson initially retained to advise on the sale of up to 9% of the company's stock through several transactions. This deal marks a first step, comprising just 1.15% of the equity. 

<P>
Western bankers and accountants working with Gazprom are awe-struck by its size and usually trot out a gee-whiz list of statistics. Essentially the successor to the Russian ministry of gas, the company supplies 50% of Russia's primary energy. It controls one third of world gas supplies. It employs 375,000 people. It has gas reserves to last 80 years at current levels of production; few western companies' reserves stretch to 20 years. Total reserves are at least 150 billion barrels, nine times those of Royal Dutch/Shell, the nearest comparable western company. Its net assets, including the largest pipeline network in the world, have a book value of around $65 billion, analysts estimate. Carried away by their hyperbole, analysts have in the past suggested that if the company were entirely privatized it would be the biggest in the world with a market capitalization well over $100 billion. (In fact this deal implies a total value of $37.4 billion.)


<P>
Investors have always been intrigued by the Gazprom story. In November 1994, Kleinwort Benson organized a presentation in New York. With just a week's notice, this attracted 140 investors representing funds under management of $3 trillion.

<P>
But investors are also wary of the Russian market, of Russian political risk, and of other problems the company faces, particularly late payment by Russian customers and the need for huge capital expenditure to recover those massive reserves. In 1994 and 1995, the company was reluctantly considering a convertible bond. Investors were demanding such huge discounts on straight equity, to compensate for Russia risk, that it could only sell shares very cheaply, depressing the valuation for all succeeding issues. 

<P>
There was a precedent for the convertible route. In 1995, Lukoil distributed $70 million of convertible bonds with international investors on the back of a $250 million placement with strategic investor Atlantic Richfield Co. But Gazprom set its heart on something more ambitious. Says James Knowles, equity syndicate manager at Morgan Stanley, "when looking at this deal, it is vital to bear in mind that the company's primary objective was to establish itself as a high-quality issuer with institutional investors rather than simply to raise money."

<P>
The offer of treasury stock took the form of London-listed GDRs. The company chose London over Luxembourg, to give investors confidence that it could meet the UK'S more stringent regulatory and transparency rules. An army of up to 50 Price Waterhouse accountants has been working with the company to produce an international accounting standard (IAS) balance sheet this year. It does not yet report its profit and loss accounts.

<P>
It quickly became clear to investors that Gazprom has financial problems. Like many Russian companies it finds that many of its domestic and former communist state customers can't or won't pay their bills. Last year it was paid for just 61% of gas supplied. This damage to its earning capacity in turn raises doubts about its ability to fund up to $40 billion of capital expenditure over the next five years. 

<P>
Another consideration is the company's place in Russian politics. It is regularly attacked by conservatives, who want to renationalize it, and by liberals, who want to break it up. For the moment, it has clear allies in prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, a former head of the gas ministry, and through him president Yeltsin. Gazprom is still 40% directly owned by the Russian government (prior to this deal, 34.11% of shares were held by Russian individuals, 24.19% by Russian institutions, 0.83% by foreigners, 0.87% by the Russia Federal Property Fund and 10% by Gazprom's treasury). It is the single largest payer of taxes to the Russian government and its single largest earner of foreign currency through gas exports. Hence the refrain repeated by Gazprom's management during the roadshows: "What is good for Gazprom is good for Russia and what is good for Russia is good for Gazprom".

<P>
If investors were reassured, there was still the question of price. Shares were marked on an indicated range of $14 to $16, some five times the price at which they change hands on the domestic market in Moscow. But these local shares have their own special risks. Every 30 days the Russian government can exercise the right to buy them back at any price it cares to name. And settlement time can be a distinctly unsettling three weeks. 

<P>
As the deal swung into its most intensive phase in October, a team of Gazprom financial staff installed themselves in the offices of the lead banks, spending much time closeted together calling Moscow on their mobile phones. Apparently investment banks' practice of taping phone calls unnerved the Russian visitors. They had much to talk about.

<P>
A story broke that Gazprom's bank accounts were being frozen in a dispute with the government over non-payment of taxes. After the visitors checked with head office, the truth appeared less dramatic. One provincial government had taken a lien over a $14 million building owned by a Gazprom subsidiary in a dispute over local taxes.

<P>
The company and its banks found some success initially with specialist Russia funds. These provided early momentum and led in more generalist investors, including wider emerging market funds as well as resource and energy funds. 

<P>
There was another anxious moment towards the end of investor presentations when rumours came out of Moscow that security chief Alexander Lebed, a clear rival to Chernomyrdin, was preparing some kind of military coup. President Yeltsin then publicly sacked Lebed. This kind of incident might have scuppered many emerging market deals. But the Gazprom offer continued to draw interest. Knowles reckons it served only to keep speculative buyers out of the order book. 

<P>
Finally the deal was four-and-half times subscribed, implying demand of nearly $2 billion, which compares with total foreign portfolio investment in Russian equity estimated at between $2 billion and $3 billion.

<P>
There was one last heart-stopping moment. On the final day of the book building, news emerged of a presidential decree completely changing the regulatory regime for Russian gas prices and addressing taxation of the company. By the time an English translation was received, order books had closed. Bankers working on the deal had a flash-back to the announcement by electricity regulator Stephen Littlechild on the day after the sale of stock in UK power generators in 1995 which scuppered their share prices. They need not have worried. The new regime says that instead of having one price for gas across Russia, in future customers nearer to gas fields will pay less for gas than those further away to reflect the high cost of gas transportation. That should help the company. Its most notorious non-payers are smokestack Russian industrial companies, usually based nearer the gas fields. Another bonus is that the government will stop basing its tax bills to Gazprom on 100% of invoiced gas sales. Instead it will tax it on the revenue it actually collects. 

<P>
The company could afford to be selective on allocations, favouring investors that diligently attended meetings and presentations as well as those willing to pay higher prices. These top-ranked investors received 50% to 60% of their orders. Some 40% of investors placing orders for stock did not receive a single share. US buyers accounted for 50% of the deal, which may help with the longer-term aim of listing in New York, with 35% going to the UK and the rest to Deutschmark-block European investors and Asia.

<H2>JP Morgan, SBC launch $3bn floater for Mexico </H2>


<h4>MEXICO'S SURPRISE plan to issue a $3bn five-year floating-rate note drew
applause from international lenders and investors yesterday.</h4>

The financing, put together by JP Morgan and Swiss Bank Corporation,
underlines the support for the country in the international banking community
and enables the Mexican government to raise a large sum of money at attractive
rates. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a very good deal,&quot; said the head of loan syndication at
one major New York bank. &quot;The price is right and if you look at the
fundamentals, the Mexican economy is really coming back.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's terrific news for Mexico,&quot; added a leading emerging markets
fund manager in New York. &quot;For banks to make that kind of commitment
is a ringing endorsement of the direction the country is going in.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The deal was won by Swiss Bank Corporation and JP Morgan after Mexico asked
a group of around six banks for ideas on how it could pay off in advance
some of the debt it owes the US Treasury. <BR>
<BR>
Mexico has used $10bn of the original $12.5bn the US Treasury provided as
part of the $20bn worldwide rescue package for Mexico in the wake of its
December 1994 peso devaluation. <BR>
<BR>
Since the beginning of this year, the Mexican government has been looking
to pay back $4.7bn of the debt in advance. It has already set aside the
$920m proceeds of its recent &#165;100bn Samurai bond and the $780m of freed
Brady bond collateral resulting from its exchange offer in April of new
global bonds for outstanding Brady debt. <BR>
<BR>
The remaining $3bn will be raised through the FRN offering. The deal has
Rule 144A language and can be sold as notes to bond investors, but will
primarily be sold to banks as a loan. <BR>
<BR>
The deal is described as an FRN that is being placed in a loan-style format.
It is a five-year facility with a two-year grace period for principal payments.
A term sheet will be sent to banks imminently.<BR>
<BR>
The deal commands a tight margin of 2.125% over Libor because it is structured
in the same way as the loan the US Treasury gave to Mexico. In the event
of a default, debt holders will have the right to tap a special account
at the Bank of New York where 30% of Pemex's oil revenues are being channelled
as collateral. That collateral amounts to about $3bn a year. <BR>
<BR>
JP Morgan and Swiss Bank Corporation will each underwrite $1bn of the FRN
issue. The 212.5bp margin on the loan appears tight, comparing with a spread
of around 280bp-290bp over Libor on a swapped basis on Mexico's five-year
global bond that was issued earlier this year. <BR>
<BR>
However, loan specialists said the syndications market commanded tighter
spreads than the bond market, while the enhancement of the Pemex revenues
provided more than enough compensation. <BR>
<BR>
The main concern was whether the markets could absorb $3bn of Mexican debt,
given the significant pick-up in Latin bond issuance and loans in recent
months. <BR>
<BR>
Some bankers wondered if the FRN would put a strain on country limits that
banks have imposed on themselves to avoid a repeat of the Latin American
debt crisis in the 1980s. <BR>
<BR>
However, Mexico has once again demonstrated its political adeptness by bringing
the deal at a time when the US is in the midst of a presidential election
campaign and Mexico gears up for congressional elections next year. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is a relationship deal,&quot; said one loan syndication banker.
&quot;It gives banks the chance to pick up yield and do both the Mexican
government and the Clinton administration a favour in the process.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Remember, it was the Republicans who said that Mexico would never
pay back the money,&quot; added another New York financier. &quot;This is
definitely a positive for Clinton.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mexican finance minister Guillermo Ortiz is said to have visited the chairmen
of leading banks in the US and Europe about the deal to ensure that these
institutions would support the financing. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Country limits can always be changed,&quot; said a loan syndication
banker in New York. &quot;I haven't run into limit problems for Mexico yet
and we are one of the main market participants. There haven't been that
many deals for Mexico this year that banks would have used up their limits.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Mexico has two main motives in doing the deal. By paying off $4.7bn of its
US Treasury debt in advance, Mexico's payments to the US Treasury over the
next two years will drop 45% from the originally scheduled $3.6bn in 1998
and $4.3bn in 1999. <BR>
<BR>
The prepayment will also result in a cost saving of about $50m. The current
US Treasury loan to the UMS has a 3-1/2 year tenor with an average cost
of 10.16% on a swapped basis -- much more expensive than the levels that
Mexico can now achieve in the international markets. At 212.5bp over Libor,
the cost of Mexico's FRN will be around 7.7%.</td>

<H3>EDITORIAL</H3>


<H3> <B>Resist the temptation </B> </H3> 

<P> It's not clear how long it will take, but it's inevitably going to happen.

<P> Some time soon, one big European bank is going to take over another big bank
from a different European country. The acquirer will argue that, with the
introduction of the euro and the fast growing flow of business within the EU, a
bank with a leading position in two or more major countries will be at a big
advantage over its competitors.

<P> The bank will be making a big mistake.

<P> It's very tempting to think that Europe (or at least north-west Europe,
particularly France and Germany) will become a single financial market. After
all, large companies such as Nestl&eacute;, Unilever or ABB increasingly think of
themselves as European rather than as Swiss, British, Dutch or Swedish. A single
currency will certainly accelerate that process.

<P> But commercial banks do not make much money from servicing such companies.
Their investment banking arms might do but, as the Wall Street firms have shown
in the past five years, longstanding relationships and a presence on the ground
throughout Europe don't necessarily count for much in winning this business.

<P> The banks' more profitable retail customers, however, have very little need
of cross-border services (and that situation will continue, euro or no euro). A
big German retail bank that buys a big French retail bank will find little
synergy between its two set of individual customers.

<P> The dangers in the merger would be far higher than the opportunities. The
number of cross-border bank mergers which have worked is tiny. We can think only
of National Australia Bank's three small UK subsidiaries, the US operations of
Royal Bank of Scotland and the two big Irish banks and, perhaps, HSBC's purchase
of Midland Bank (although, arguably, both are British banks).

<P> Culture and language clashes are too great. There is always the risk that
remote operations evade central controls. The alternative &#173; dual
headquarters &#173; merely creates stifling bureaucracy. And it would be
particularly hard to control costs in such a bank.

<P> When Deutsche/Barclays/ABN announces it is buying BNP/Commerz/Generale Bank,
don't forget you read the warning here first.

<H2> <B>A financial transfer market?</B> </H2> <P> Last month, British soccer
player Alan Shearer was headhunted by Newcastle United from his former club,
Blackburn Rovers. Newcastle paid Blackburn a world record &#163;15 million
transfer fee for taking its star player. Shearer himself got a signing-on fee of
10% of the transfer fee, plus a salary of &#163;25,000 a week.

<P> Coincidentally, last month also saw the resolution of the dispute between ING
Barings and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. ING had sued DMG in the US courts for
poaching most of ING's Latin American equity team. The practice of hiring whole
teams &#173; and of the raided bank moaning about the ethics of the action &#173;
has a long history. But this was the first time a bank has been sued for the
practice. The law suit was dropped only when DMG agreed not to hire any more ING
staff until the end of the year.

<P> Is there a lesson for the financial markets in the way football transfers
work? Should Deutsche Bank have paid Merrill Lynch a transfer fee when it poached
Edson Mitchell to run its debt operation, for instance?

<P> The economics of soccer and of financial institutions are not dissimilar.
Both rely for success on a few highly-paid stars; skills in both are easily
transferred from one firm/team to another  (or even from one country to another).

<P> Soccer players (and other entertainment professionals, such as pop singers)
tend to be on fixed-term or permanent contracts. When a club forces a player to
break his contract, by convention it pays a fee to his former club.

<P> Could this system not be transferred to the financial world? Few investment
bankers have a contract of any sort (besides a signing-on agreement). This allows
them to move freely. But suppose a top firm &#173; Morgan Stanley, say, or
Goldman Sachs &#173; started to require a long-term commitment, such as a
fixed-term contract, from the staff it hired. Suppose further that, in return, it
paid them higher-than-average remuneration. It could then probably demand
compensation if another firm poached these staff. Perhaps, even, the top firms
could get together and agree to pay transfer fees when they hired top staff from
each other. That would dramatically reduce the poaching of whole teams, as few
banks would agree to such a big transfer. It would also mean direct financial
reward for training staff: at the moment, it's easier to wait for someone else to
do that, and then poach.

<P> It might not be long before the transfer of an Edson Mitchell creates as many
headlines in the popular press as the transfer of an Alan Shearer.

<P> <I>Disagree with </I>Euromoney<I>'s editorials? <BR> You can argue back on
the Internet. Go to www.euromoney.com/alert/groups/</I>

<H3> <B>FINANCIAL LAWYER </B> </H3> 
<H3> <B>Towards a tax-neutral pooling scheme</B></H3>
<p>  <B>Moves to develop a tax-neutral pension fund pooling
scheme should help propel UK fund management to the centre of
the international stage. 
<br>By Christopher Stoakes</B><P>


<p> Over the past four years, an informal task force, which includes the
International Fund Managers Association (IFMA) and a number of other City
institutions and professionals, has been working on a mechanism to make London a
more attractive centre for international pension fund management. The mechanism
is a form of unit trust called a pension fund pooling scheme (PFPS), which
enables the assets of pension funds from different jurisdictions (host countries)
to be pooled so that they can then be invested in markets worldwide (market
countries).

<P> The critical factor is tax. The PFPS must not be subject to tax itself,
otherwise it will be less efficient than a direct investment from the host
country to the market country. And it must be transparent so that market
countries will allow taxes withheld by them to be repaid under double-tax
treaties with host countries (and not with the UK, where the PFPS is located). In
short, the PFPS must be tax-neutral, so that a host country's pension fund would
be in an identical position if it had itself directly invested in its portion of
the underlying securities in the market countries.

<P> The benefit to UK investment managers is efficiency. They can run pooled
funds without having to segregate and administer each client fund's assets
separately. But multinational companies are also behind the initiative. Although
pension fund assets do not, legally speaking, belong to the companies but to
their pension funds, chief financial officers (CFOs) know that any shortfall in
the pension fund has to be made good by the company.

<P> Other concerns include the increased duties imposed on
trustees (of whom the CFO is usually one) in the wake of the Maxwell affair, and
the inefficiency of having separate subsidiaries' pension funds managed by
different managers trading in and out of the same underlying investment. The PFPS
mechanism gives the CFO a strong argument for centralizing group pension assets
spread amongst subsidiaries, each with its own trustees and investment managers.

<P> Although the UK has had exempt unauthorized unit trusts (EUUTs) for some time
(exempt from tax and unauthorized in that they cannot be sold to the public),
these have been used only by UK pension funds and other UK investors exempt from
tax on chargeable gains. This is because these EUUTs are treated as taxable
entities for capital gains tax purposes &#173; the exemption, which applies to
non-taxable UK investors, does not apply to investors which are exempt only by
virtue of being non-UK resident &#173; and because, since 1988, the trustees of
EUUTs have been subject to UK income tax. Although income tax is reclaimable by
investors, the fact that it is itself taxable is likely to impede transparency
for double-tax purposes.

<P> The problem for the IFMA task force was that these tax provisions were
embedded in UK legislation. Trying to change any country's tax laws can be a
Sisyphean task. The IFMA has been fortunate in two respects. The first is that
professional advisers have been prepared to do the initial work on a <I>pro
bono</I> basis. City law firm Ashurst Morris Crisp has been leading the
discussions with the Inland Revenue. It has recently been joined by Ernst &amp;
Young, which is spearheading the effort to agree the tax position with tax
authorities in host countries. Consultant actuary Watson Wyatt is seeking
approval of the new vehicle from regulatory authorities in host countries. ERISA
issues in the US (so called after the legislation governing US pension funds) are
being handled by US law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton to enable US pension funds
to invest in the PFPS structure.

<P> The second is that the UK's Inland Revenue has been particularly
accommodating: the initiative to change the legislation &#173; which was done by
regulations laid before parliament on June 19 &#173; came not from ministers in
the Treasury but from senior Inland Revenue officials who could see the benefit
to the City and, at the same time, realized that no tax would be lost as a
result. "The point of the PFPS is that it does not produce some new statutory
entity," says John Watson, a tax partner at Ashurst Morris Crisp, "but simply
leaves the unit trust structure in its natural form as it is in, say, Jersey."

<P> The fact that the professional advisers have not been acting for specific
clients has made it easier for the Inland Revenue to cooperate. They in turn have
been able to pool information and, following the regulations' enactment on June
19, will be able to publicize progress. At the same time they are keen to
coordinate efforts to have the PFPS structure sanctioned by tax authorities in
market countries and pension fund regulators in host countries, so that the
respective authorities are not confused by being presented with a number of
different PFPS structures which might discourage them from giving their approval.
Custodians in particular are likely to be interested: by providing the PFPS
structure to managers, they will gain custody of the underlying securities while
taking on much of the administration currently handled in-house by pension funds.

<P> There are strict rules on the types of pension fund which are eligible. There
is always a risk that an overseas pension fund will misunderstand the pooling
regulations, thereby causing a PFPS to include a non-qualifying participant. If
that happens, the tax status of the PFPS will not be lost, provided the trustee
and manager of the PFPS take action to jettison the participant within a set time
limit.

<P> The Inland Revenue has indicated that it will not regard a
PFPS as carrying on business in the UK for treaty purposes; it, too, will regard
the PFPS as transparent. However, at the same time, discussion is continuing as
to the mechanism under which managers should be able to claim tax credits on
behalf of unit holders.

<P> The PFPS documentation can be structured so that the manager is treated as
providing services to the unit holders directly and not to the PFPS itself. This
means that investors outside the EU will not suffer value-added tax on management
expenses, while those within the EU will be in precisely the same position as if
they had themselves employed managers for direct investment.

<P> Attempts have been made to use limited partnerships in the Netherlands to
pool international pension funds, but these have never really taken off. It may
be that it would be more difficult to persuade market countries to regard these
as transparent on a worldwide basis since most have partnership structures of
their own &#173; frequently on the basis that their partnerships are legal
entities. Similarly, the US has a structure called the common trust fund which
may prove a useful precedent in obtaining agreement from market countries. The
common trust fund is, however, generally run by US banks and not available as a
general pooling vehicle.

<P> "If London hadn't come up with the PFPS, someone else would have done," says
Watson, "and we would in effect have been placing an obstruction in the way of
the UK's international investment management business, which would not have been
a clever thing to do."

<H3>FRONT END</H3>
<B>Edited by Steven Irvine</B><BR>

<H2>Requiem for research </H2>
The equities division of DB Research, the research arm of Deutsche Bank,
has been decapitated by the sudden, if not entirely unexpected, departure
of its chief analyst, Thomas Neisse. The company itself is expected to be
wound up at year-end. <BR>
<BR>
Neisse's resignation marks the end of a four-year attempt to establish the
first independent research body at a German bank. Set up at the beginning
of 1992, DB Research underlined its autonomy by operating as a separate
company. &quot;DB Research was the only [bank-owned] research firm worldwide
that tried to serve investors and not corporate finance,&quot; says Petra
Zamagna, until recently the firm's star chemicals analyst. <BR>
<BR>
DB Research operated in such a fiercely independent way that it often sabotaged
its parent bank's plans to launch stock or bond issues by refusing to endorse
the proposed price. <BR>
<BR>
But DB Research's fatal flaw was its failure to attract enough paying customers.
Wolfgang Schumann, DB Research's former head of companies research, said
that less than 10% of its income was from outside customers. <BR>
<BR>
Although DB Research announced a small profit last year, in reality it was
heavily subsidized by Deutsche Bank. The prices the bank paid for research
were adjusted regularly so that they covered the research house's projected
losses. <BR>
<BR>
But the new ambitions of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell to become a global investment
house have put pressure on DB Research to serve the bank's business interests
and products. &quot;Previously Deutsche Bank didn't have a particularly
successful corporate finance business, so the independence of DB Research
was accepted by the board [of the bank],&quot; Zamagna says. That is no
longer the case. <BR>
<BR>
Earlier this year Hung Tran, the DB Research managing director for equities,
was effectively demoted and exiled to Singapore, while the firm's figurehead,
Professor Norbert Walter, has continued to focus his attention on macroeconomic
research, where his authority is undisputed. &quot;He's detached from all
this,&quot; says one former analyst. <BR>
<BR>
That left Neisse and his staff to negotiate with Morgan Grenfell's new equities
team, recruited from SG Warburg. In regular battles with Maurice Coehrs,
Michael Thompson and David Haysey, the Germans came out the worse for wear
- 11 equity analysts resigned in succession. <BR>
<BR>
What the Germans most bitterly resent is the short-termism and hard-sell
techniques the British have brought in. &quot;What happens now is that the
bank's latest deal is praised to the skies,&quot; laments a recent defector.
<BR>
<BR>
DB Research appears to be on the point of being closed altogether. Sources
say that Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell have already decided to reintegrate
the equities side of DB Research into the bank. At the beginning of 1996,
half will go to the private-client division, which deals with high-net-worth
individuals; the other half to trading and sales. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the defectors have gone to other German banks and corporations where
principles of shareholder value and wholly independent research are still
in their infancy. Chemicals analyst Petra Zamagna now runs investor relations
at Hoechst; J&uuml;rgen Ackermann, former head of financial institutions
research, holds the same position at Commerzbank; and meanwhile their former
boss, Thomas Neisse, is set to put Bayerische Vereinsbank's asset management
division on the map. <B>Laura Covill</B> <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Merrill's marauders hit Hamleys </H2>
The opening Christmas party of the London Euromarket season was perhaps
also the most original - Merrill Lynch's virtual reality party. Held in
the Sega centre in the basement of Hamleys in London, one of the world's
biggest toy stores, the bash gave a new spin to the notion that the market
is childish. <BR>
<BR>
Entertainment was provided by state-of-the-art video games that included
driving, gun shooting and fighting simulations. <BR>
<BR>
David Tory, head of Merrill Lynch's European syndicate, says the idea was
to stop people just talking about work. Some credit for the idea is thought
to lie with new Merrill syndicate man Niall Cameron, whose reputation for
festive ingenuity at former employer IBJ was nothing if not enormous. <BR>
<BR>
Late into the evening, David Tory joked that there was also a hidden agenda:
&quot;I reckon that a few hours on these machines makes you brain-dead for
weeks, and stops you being able to count.&quot; He grinned, and looked around
at his competitors, and the potential mandates that would beckon. But then
almost immediately his willpower evaporated and he played four consecutive
games of dirt-track rally-racing against two colleagues<I>.</I> He emerged
from the driving seat victorious in two of the four races. <BR>
<BR>
Head of capital markets John McNiven did not appear to risk his numeracy
at any point during the evening. <BR>
<BR>
The charge that the games made for a slightly unsocial atmosphere was answered
by one syndicate head: &quot;We all talk to each other every day. Why would
we want to talk to each other at a party?&quot; In fact, so engrossing were
the games that apparently the party was one of the &quot;best value&quot;
Merrill had ever had. Because of them nobody drank very much. <B>Steven
Irvine</B> <BR><BR>
<H2>Tokyo 16 hold out </H2>
Nearly half the major foreign securities brokerages in Tokyo have refused
a request to make public the financial statements of their operations in
Japan. The 16 houses that declined to respond to forceful enquiries from
the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) included Baring Securities,
BZW, WI Carr, Goldman Sachs, Kleinwort Benson, Schroder, Soci&eacute;t&eacute;

Takaaki Okada of the JSDA says:<I> </I>&quot;To enhance the confidence of
participants in the transparency of the market we planned to release financial
data on securities houses capitalized at more than &#165;3 billion ($29.4
million). We hoped all securities firms would obey our request but unfortunately
16 foreign securities houses refused. Some argued that, because they operate
globally, if they have to release such financial data it should be on a
global basis. This point is very much disputed. We tried hard this time.
Next year we will have to make our utmost effort.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A heated debate on the request erupted in the securities committee of the
European Business Council in Tokyo. Committee chairman Patrick Murray, the
chief representative of broker James Capel (owned by Hongkong Bank), told
members to &quot;examine their own consciences on the issue&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Murray asserts that the &quot;specious huge profits and huge losses&quot;
that appear on such financial statements from &quot;very large arbitrage
positions&quot; are measured on an accrual basis, not mark-to-market, when
presented to the JSDA and to the Japanese finance ministry. These are, Murray
says, &quot;only of interest to Japanese journalists. If you have big profits,
they say you need more regulation. If you have big losses, they say you
are going bust. We have found it a waste of time talking to the press.&quot;
Murray also argues that &quot;you have to have big balance sheets, otherwise
people don't want to deal with you&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;James Capel's results in Japan are totally immaterial to Hong Kong,&quot;
Murray says. &quot;If we make or lose &#163;10 million [$15 million] it
is quite irrelevant to the Hongkong Bank, which is concerned whether it
makes &#163;2.5 billion or &#163;3.0 billion. It should be put in context.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
But the JSDA points out that figures on foreign brokerages' capitalization
were deliberately excluded from the statements it has released. <BR>
<BR>
According to the JSDA, total net losses in the first half of fiscal 1995
for the 52 foreign brokerages in Japan (including those with capital of
less than &#165;3 billion) amounted to &#165;51.17 billion, compared with
net profits totalling &#165;3.67 billion in the same period in 1994. Of
the 20 houses that agreed to have their income profit made public, Merrill
Lynch scored highest, largely from own-account trading of Japanese government
bonds. <BR>
<BR>
Deutsche Bank Capital Markets (part of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell) performed
the worst, with a &#165;1.98 billion net loss. Tokyo DB Capital first vice-president
Heinz Roesch referred this to Deutsche's Frankfurt head office, where a
spokesman's first reply was that he knew nothing of the loss. After consulting
with DB Capital in Tokyo, he attributed the entire loss to &quot;arbitrage&quot;
accounting and insisted DB Capital in Tokyo had &quot;really&quot; turned
a profit. <B>Peter McGill</B> <BR><BR>

<H2>Protection money </H2>
The tiny Principality of Andorra in the Pyrenees has put together a strategy
to delay foreign bank encroachment on what is arguably Europe's cosiest
banking cartel. The six Andorran banks have reached agreement with their
government to contribute an annual Pta3.25 billion ($27 million) to the
public coffers over the next three years in exchange for a promise to prevent
foreign banks entering. <BR>
<BR>
The 468 square kilometre mountain principality is ultimately a joint suzerainty
shared by the president of France and the Spanish bishop of La Seu d'Urgell<B>
</B>but it has a locally elected head of government who appoints his own
ruling council. In the past its most flourishing industry was smuggling,
which has today been largely supplanted by tourism, duty-free shopping and
offshore banking. <BR>
<BR>
The agreement is not a bad deal for the government - the payments will cover
more than 10% of its annual budget for the three years. It may sound a trifle
unorthodox, but the local banking association, Agrupaci&oacute; de Bancs
Andorrans (ABA), sees it simply as a way in which the country's banks can
prepare themselves to face outside competition. &quot;It is true that there
is agreement in principle to provide this sum, but it is to enable the banks
to adjust their structures in the short term to the arrival of foreign banks,&quot;
says the ABA's Francesc Ter&eacute;s. <BR>
<BR>
The move was prompted by the upcoming expiry of a law which prevents foreign
banks from owning more than 33% of a local institution or operating their
own franchises. Delays have deliberately been built into a new constitutional
arrangement worked out between the government and the banks whereby legislation
to open the system to all-comers will be introduced in the second half of
1997. Foreign banks will then have six months to apply for licences, but
this will be followed by a one-year waiting period duing which the <BR>
government will deliberate on applications. <BR>
<BR>
Andorra is not an EU member and is not a signatory to any of the EU accords
on personal or corporate taxation. Of the country's bank deposits, 90% are
offshore accounts, held largely by Spanish citizens. Bankers believe that
once the doors are opened Andorra may serve the seriously rich of southern
Europe in the same way that Liechtenstein plays private banker to wealthy
individuals in its neighbours Switzerland, Germany and Austria. &quot;It
is easier to get to than any other offshore centre and the skiing is excellent,&quot;
says a Spanish banker. <B>Jules Stewart</B> <BR>

<H2>One of our Picassos is missing </H2>
&quot;Le Cavalier&quot;, a large canvas by Pablo Picasso of a comical knight
in armour on horseback, was missing. &quot;It's gone! I can't believe it!
Only last week I showed it to a visitor,&quot; exclaimed a Sanyo Securities
official as he gazed in horror at a blank white wall backing on to the staff
canteen. <BR>
<BR>
Also missing from Sanyo Securities, according to a worried Japanese finance
ministry, is adequate capital strength (less than 200%, on the MoF capital
adequacy measurement for brokerages), after Sanyo posted another net loss
of &#165;10.4 billion ($102 million) in the first half ending September
30, on top of a 1994-95 net loss of &#165;31.741 billion that was equivalent
to 42.55% of shareholders' equity. <BR>
<BR>
Sanyo's corporate losses and the disposal of a valuable painting look to
be connected. &quot;Le Cavalier&quot; was the pride of the legendary collection
which former Sanyo president Yoichi Tsuchiya used to decorate the vast dealing
centre built on land reclaimed from Tokyo Bay. The building opened in May
1988, the height of the bubble <BR>
economy when the Nikkei Index was levitating in defiance of all natural
law, and Sanyo liked to be known as Japan's &quot;fastest-growing securities
house&quot;. Its revenues had tripled in the previous five years. <BR>
<BR>
Previously with Nomura Securities, where he was known as an ardent computer
enthusiast, Tsuchiya had assumed the Sanyo presidency from his father in
1985. Of the &#165;8 billion he <BR>
authorized to be spent on the centre, &#165;3 billion went into a customized
computer system - for which he personally made measurements - in the world's
largest dealing room. The Stadium, as it came to be called in Tokyo, could
accommodate 700 traders, although during Sanyo's peak five years ago it
only ever had 530, and today houses just 300. From the visitors' gallery
The Stadium looks like NASA headquarters, but a Sanyo official points out
that the computer system is now well below space-shuttle standard and needs
a team of maintenance engineers to cope with regular glitches and breakdowns.
<BR>
<BR>
Tsuchiya's head was served up on a platter as the price of a bail-out of
Sanyo last autumn led by Nomura. To recapitalize Sanyo, Nomura Land bought
over 33 million of its shares, raising its stake from 5.3% to 16.3%. Sanyo's
three main banks - Nippon Credit Bank (NCB), Bank of Tokyo (BoT), and Daiwa
Bank - also marginally increased their holdings to a total 14.7%. Tsuchiya's
successor as president, Takashi Ikeuchi, is a trusted old Nomura Securities
hand. <BR>
<BR>
Sanyo's dealing centre still has plenty of bubble-period art purchases scattered
about, paintings by Renoir and Frank Stella, statues by Henry Moore and
Rodin, plus a mechanical grand piano in the lobby. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Euromoney</I>'s guide from Sanyo lamented the disappearance of the drink-filled
refrigerator from the conference room. &quot;We hope to get it back next
year when the economy and stock market pick up,&quot; he said. His own administrative
offices close to the Tokyo Stock Exchange are more in keeping with Sanyo's
straitened circumstances. The lobby there only boasts a wire cage housing
three green budgerigars. <B>PM</B> <BR>

<BR>
<H2>Luz&oacute;n's late nights </H2>
Francisco Luz&oacute;n has one thing at the top of his New Year wish list
- getting the third tranche of the Argentaria privatization away before
the Spanish general election in March. The bank's chairman would like to
see a majority of the shares in public hands before - as appears almost
certain - the government changes. <BR>
<BR>
But the chances are slim. Banking analyst Jose Sevilla at Spanish broker
FG Inversiones says filing requirements in the US may delay the process:
&quot;They have to audit and close their books and submit the documentation
to the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission]. This brings us to late
February, which would be right in the middle of the election campaign.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
To make matters worse the share price languishes well below the Pta4,800
($39) or so level the market is looking for. But Luz&oacute;n says Argentaria
is the &quot;most undervalued of Spanish banks&quot; and hopes the market
will agree when it sees the 1995 results due to be announced on January
25. <BR>
<BR>
Luz&oacute;n is a bit of an outsider in the world of Spanish banking, put
in his present position by his friend the former economics minister Carlos
Solchaga. <BR>
<BR>
Recently, takeover rumours, strained relations with the government and mounting
political turmoil have prompted Luz&oacute;n to reaffirm his determination
to gain majority control of the bank - the government still has 51.1%. In
an election it is feared that the rival Popular Party may use the Socialist-created
bank to bash the government. After the election, heads may roll, and Luz&oacute;n's
position is viewed as highly vulnerable. <BR>
<BR>
If the offering goes ahead, 50% will go to foreign institutions. Morgan
Stanley and Argentaria's broking arm are likely to be mandated as global
coordinators, with SBC Warburg and Banco Santander de Negocios as joint-leads.
<BR>
<BR>
Luz&oacute;n already has a reputation for working 14-hour days. But says
one of his colleagues: &quot;It's fingers crossed over the next few weeks.
The lights are going to be burning a little later than usual in the chairman's
office.&quot; <B>JS</B> <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>London's Mr Fixit </H2>
&quot;I like to solve problems rather than stroke them,&quot; says Michael
Cassidy, chairman of the policy and resources committee for the Corporation
of London, who is responsible for promoting the City of London as a financial
centre. An example of this occurred when Deutsche Bank decided to move the
centre of its investment banking operations there. Deutsche plan to build
a three storey bridge - completewith dealing rooms - from its new tower
to Morgan Grenfell's Great Winchester Street HQ. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We got their planning permission through in two months. When there
was a legal challenge, we personally fought it in the courts and saw off
all nine points of objection in half a day.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Persuading Deutsche to locate its global investment banking business in
London was clearly a top priority. Unusually, the Corporation accommodated
Deutsche's desire to own Great Winchester Street. &quot;The highway is still
ours, but the air above and the soil beneath is Deutsche's.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Corporation owns a fifth of the city of London, and Cassidy readily
admits his attitudes to promoting its success are bold. &quot;We can make
sure there are no delays in the system,&quot; he hints helpfully. <BR>
<BR>
A lawyer by training, he is fast and flexible. And he takes his job - batting
for London - very seriously. After the Bishopsgate bomb in 1993 he met over
400 bankers in the next six weeks, for security consultations. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wall Street doesn't have a local authority,&quot; he says, &quot;And
that's why it's one third empty.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
What next? Look out for a battle with Prince Charles over building long
flat trading floors by St Paul's Cathedral.<B> SI</B> <BR>

<H3>EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION</H3>



<H2> <B>A technical ascent </B> </H2> <H4> <B>All over Europe, banks are counting
the cost of preparing for the single currency &#173; whether their home country
is "in" or "out". Apart from buying new bank-wide technology, they face a loss of
trading revenue and a threat to their corporate client base. Not to mention the
thought that it may never happen. Peter Lee reports </B> </H4> <P> How much will
it cost European banks to adapt to the single currency by 1999? A medium-sized
fortune, they are beginning to realize.

<P> Banks in countries due to participate in European economic and monetary union
(Emu) will have to convert every domestic account and every product they offer
into the new currency. For three years they will have to operate in national
currency and in euros, and finally they must make sure they have the systems and
logistics to support the withdrawal of old national currency coins and notes.
When the UK changed to a decimal currency in 1971, the process of adapting to new
coins and notes took two-and-a-half years. It amounts to an overhaul of banks'
entire operating systems.

<P> Edouard de Lencquesaing, executive vice- president co-ordinating single
currency preparations for Cr&eacute;dit Commercial de France, says the bank's
investment will probably be the equivalent to one year's normal spending on
systems development. But he admits: "The areas of greatest investment spending
are not yet clear. Ideally, we would like to centralize some euro functions." But
that may not be possible. "As of today, the project is spreading through and
touching all parts of the bank."

<P> The European Banking Federation estimates a bill for Europe's banks of Ecu8
billion to Ecu10 billion, or an additional 1% to 2% of banks' operating costs
spread over three or four years. That echoes a British Bankers Association
estimate for the cost to the average bank of a big-bang style conversion to the
single currency of 2% of annual non-interest expenses spread over two or three
years. The phased introduction which is now planned will be less problematic than
a sudden big-bang changeover, but possibly more expensive. For example, during
the second half of 2002, banks' retail systems must cope with euro and national
currency bank notes and coins circulating together.

<P> Generale Bank recently estimated that it would spend Bfr2 billion ($65
million) on the project. Willy Kestens, global treasurer at Kredietbank, agrees
that Kredietbank's spending will be of the same order of size, without reaching
that high figure: "The situation is different for banks, depending on their
previous preparations. As a major dealer in the Ecu we have developed dual and
multi-currency systems over many years. A lot of the spending some European banks
are now facing, we have already undertaken in the last five years."

<P> Deutsche Bank estimates its conversion costs at around Dm300 million. Other
German banks foresee spending on a similar scale. Ernst-Moritz Lipp, deputy
managing director and board member of Dresdner Bank, responsible for
co-ordinating the bank's preparations for the euro, suggests Dm200 million. He
predicts that other large European banks will each have to invest between Dm150
million and Dm250 million, presenting the continent's leading banks with a bill
of up to Dm3 billion.

<P> Lipp's information-technology experts calculate that Germany's smaller banks,
just to allow data processing in the single currency, will need to invest Dm2
million for each Dm1 billion of balance sheet assets. Other bankers suggest that,
of the total cost of the project, two-thirds is likely to go on systems, with the
rest on training and marketing.

<P> Peter Wolf-K&ouml;ppen, director at Commerzbank, says Dm150 million to Dm200
million is a realistic figure for his bank's preparations, though he adds it is
hard to isolate Emu-related costs. A huge task for the banks will be to provide
advice to their retail and corporate clients on how they might use the single
currency, especially during the three-year interim phase when national currencies
and the euro will co-exist. "If you add up discussions on the euro with three
million retail and corporate customers, that's a huge cost. But Commerzbank would
be talking to its customers anyway," says Wolf-K&ouml;ppen. Similarly, banks
would be investing considerable amounts in improving their electronic
data-processing systems, even without the single-currency project.

<P> Equally significant will be the loss of revenues. Foreign exchange commission
will disappear for transactions between Emu countries, hurting in particular
large banks in small countries such as Ireland, Belgium and Austria. Banks are
predicting a "5% to 10% hit to the revenue base, according to those we have
contacted", says Steven Davis of Davis International Banking Consultants. These
banks are searching for new ways to replace their lost earnings, but Davis also
warns: "Three years is barely enough time to revise totally their operating
systems, much less their strategy."

<P> The political timetable and the lead-time needed for systems development do
not necessarily match. "Many people still seem to think we have three years,"
says Kestens at Kredietbank. "But banks do not. As soon as the new European
Central Bank begins operating its monetary policy in euros (from the start of
1999) &#173; with all the instruments available to it including repos &#173;
banks must be ready."

<P> Bankers are wary of discussing their preparations down to the last detail,
partly for competitive reasons, partly because they're still waiting for central
market authorities to make the decisions that will dictate their own systems
changes and partly, one suspects, because banks are not yet fully on top of the
project. Those banks which are best prepared for the new currency will enjoy a
strong competitive advantage over banks which fumble the challenge.

<P> While the French banks are tending to play a political game, hoping to use
the euro project as a means to promote Paris as a financial centre, in Germany
some of the technical requirements are becoming clear, and the banks have started
filling in the details.

<P> <B>German banks plan their systems</B>

<P> The German bankers' association in Cologne has produced a 600-page book,
detailing thousands of individual steps banks should take in the run-up to
monetary union. The association produced the book after lengthy consultation with
leading German banks. It is being translated into English and other languages so
that foreign banks in Germany can show it to their head-office executives. The
report contains recommendations on needed changes, from banks' payments systems,
to ATMs and even cashiers' equipment.

<P> Showing a commendably entrepreneurial spirit, the association is charging
Dm1,000 a time for copies of the book. Even at that hefty cover price, it would
have to sell a million copies just to recoup the combined investments of the five
leading German private banks. It's not likely to be that kind of best-seller.

<P> The report emphasizes that the Bundesbank will support German banks' efforts
to encourage customers to use the euro from the earliest possible date. It is
guaranteeing that payment instructions can be delivered in euro, while still
carrying Deutschmark amounts, and that Deutschmark sums can still be credited to
a customer's account, even on a payment originating in euros. German banks must
adapt to a flexible domestic payments and clearing system redesigned for
dual-currency use. "We already have an agreement on common data formats for
interbank clearing, and that is very important for software development and
consultants," says Wilhelm Niehoff, manager at the German bankers' association.

<P> Countries participating in Emu will be chosen as early as possible in 1998,
supposedly on the basis of economic data for 1997. Conversion rates for
participating currencies into the euro will be fixed some time between then and
January 1 1999, when the euro is scheduled to replace them. According to the plan
for the introduction of the euro laid down last December at the Madrid summit,
corporates and investors will be free, but not obliged, to use the euro during
phase B, the transition period from 1999 to 2002. Banks are likely to switch
quickly to the euro for their own internal payments and accounts.

<P> The agreement within Germany between domestic banks and the Bundesbank
decrees that all domestic interbank clearing systems will operate in euros from
the start. But banks must live with the uncertainty of how quickly their
customers will follow. This adds to their basic task of converting their millions
of bank accounts, loans and savings contracts into the new currency.

<P> Payments systems must be amended so that both national currency and euro
denominations can be handled interchangeably through the three-year transition
period. That will also require payments' clearing houses to alter their message
formats.

<P> Banks outside the euro block will have to handle payments in the euro as
another foreign currency. In the long run, banks' customers rightly expect the
single-currency project to simplify and reduce the cost of cross-border payments
transfers. Once differences between data structures are removed, a mechanism with
the characteristics of one large domestic system should emerge.

<P> Some of European banks' greatest efforts will be made in simple domestic
retail banking. Kestens says: "Hundreds of thousands of accounts will be changed
from January 1 1999. The internal accounts of the bank will be in euro, while
many incoming and outgoing payments will be in Belgian francs. Account holders
will have the choice of which currency to have their statements in." There are
still questions to be decided. Will a customer be able to have all payments in
his account stated in national currency and euros, or will one currency be used
throughout with just the balance converted? Kestens is not sure. "We still have a
lot to do on the domestic side," he says, "and there is still the question of
adapting ATMs and introducing coins and banknotes. But mentally we are prepared."

<P> More complex products also demand attention. Banks must decide how to modify
OTC derivatives contracts maturing in 1999 and beyond. Europe's derivatives
exchanges are grappling with the same problem. The likely solution is to write
contracts in all currencies so that they convert unequivocally into euro
denomination, if and when the original currency becomes a euro participant.

<P> Banks must decide many questions on standardized terms and conditions for
price and interest-rate quotation of securities within the euro bloc. Should
interest be calculated on the basis of a 360- or 365-day business year? The
question arises because of different calendars of public holidays within the
bloc.

<P> <B>Getting the pricing right</B>

<P> Traders in OTC derivatives will have special concerns. As with bond markets,
traders need to determine conventions on rounding, and business days used for
payment accruals, so that when derivatives are converted from national currencies
into the euro there are no remaining mismatches between derivative positions and
associated hedges. Banks must also decide whether or not to accept, for example,
French franc cash and government bond collateral against euro margin
requirements.

<P> Converting future cash flows on swaps and other contracts from national
currencies to the euro will be straightforward. More troublesome will be the
pricing and valuation of many instruments influenced by a new euro yield curve,
which will take time to develop, along with the new euro-denominated government
bond and money markets.

<P> Even in countries unlikely to join the euro, bankers are biting the bullet. A
major Spanish bank, says Davis, "even if it were convinced that Spain would never
join Emu, must be prepared for several hundred branches of Deutsche Bank in Spain
to offer euro-denominated loans and deposits to its customers". Many
multinational companies, including those headquartered in countries outside Emu,
will want euro products. And so expertise in the euro will be a weapon for some
banks to attack new markets.

<P> Malcolm Levitt, EU advisor at Barclays Bank, warns: "We believe that we must
be ready with our strategies and systems in 1999, even though we cannot be sure
the single currency will happen or that the UK will participate." Levitt's rough
estimate is that two-thirds of European banks' total spending will be on
converting retail banking systems, and Barclays will not begin those investments
until the UK is firmly committed to participation. Meanwhile, it sees its task as
being "to ensure our wholesale and forex systems have the capacity and
functionality to support using the euro as a foreign currency. As to capacity,
the euro will replace some other currencies, though we cannot be sure how quickly
its use will spread." He is nevertheless confident that, "given the annual IT
spend of an institution like Barclays, this project will not break the bank".

<P> As well as individual banks, central authorities for all securities and
currency markets must prepare. In August, the London Investment Banking
Association published a report on the implications of Emu for various settlement
and related facilities for wholesale financial markets in London. It included 63
detailed recommendations for various public authorities, settlement utilities and
market participants to tackle. The report produced recommendations for the
international central securities depositories, Euroclear and Cedel, which settle
much of the international bond trading struck in London. Banks must help drive
these developments within market systems and ensure compatibility with their own
IT.

<P> A sample of the points made by the report include the following. All market
participants must find a way to cope with the question of redenomination of
securities from national currencies into the euro. It is inevitable that the
conversion rates will change the nominal value of an investor's holding of, say,
French franc OATs, from whole numbers of francs into whole numbers plus fractions
in euros. These would be incompatible with most trading and clearing systems
which simply do not cater for fractions. Various solutions are possible, such as
issuers allowing investors the choice of a cash adjustment to bring their
holdings back to a whole number or the chance to invest an additional sum.
Alternatively, bonds might stay denominated in national currencies with actual
payments against delivery made in euros.

<P> Redenomination raises other issues and complexities. For an issuer to revise
the amounts of its outstanding security issues might require shareholder meetings
and approval or even changes to company law. For discretionary fund managers to
accept one or other redenomination option might require them to seek approval
from each individual investing client.

<P> The issues multiply. The co-existence of new euro-denominated bonds and old
national-currency bonds from the same government or corporate issuer threatens to
split the market and reduce liquidity. Price display systems will have to adapt
to show national currency and euro pricing for the same bonds.

<P> Banks and clearing systems may receive different currency instructions for
two sides of the same trade and will need to develop "intelligent" matching
systems to accommodate this.

<P> And there are more mundane questions. Should redenominated securities be
issued with new international security identification numbers and other local
codes?

<P> Wolf-K&ouml;ppen at Commerzbank outlines the bank's approach to the
bewildering variety of challenges thrown up by Emu. "During the changeover period
we have to be prepared to offer all our products, from credit to deposits, in
either national currency or euro. That means we have to look at every programme
in our systems, decide what about it, if anything, to change, when to change it
and how much capacity or manpower it will take." Changing Commerzbank's
programmes will take 250 to 350 managers working hundreds of man-years, he says.

<P> Coping with such a massive project will test banks' capabilities and
resources to the limit. Lipp at Dresdner Bank admits: "We have found a technical
and managerial bottle-neck. To take up such a huge challenge in such a short time
exceeds the capability of our in-house IT managers. Their normal task is to
develop a system for a particular segment of the bank. They face the difficulty
of up-grading across the board. We now must decide how much we can do in-house
and how much we should rely on external advisers and implementers." The bank is
considering buying in whole systems from outside suppliers.

<P> <B>To boldly expand or specialize</B>

<P> At most large banks, one senior executive responsible for the euro sits atop
various committees, usually comprising systems people and a few individuals
co-opted from the banks' main operating businesses. These taskforces have been
pondering the challenge ahead for months, if not years. Now they face the more
difficult task of going back to business heads, explaining what systems changes
they must accept and fund, and implementing the changeover. That will be tough.

<P> Lipp maps out the timetable Dresdner Bank has followed in its preparations.
Last year was a year for research into the implications of the single currency
for clients and for the bank's own products and technology. The conclusion:
dramatic changes will affect all parts of the bank from 1999. In 1996 Dresdner
Bank began advising clients &#173; retail, corporate and institutional &#173;
about the euro. It ran workshops for corporate clients and devised checklists for
them, addressing how far the single currency would affect their industry sector
and their generic corporate functions. It also began the huge task of training
over 30,000 staff around its own branch network. From 1997 onwards comes the real
investment in technology.

<P> The good news, according to Lipp, is that the bank is confident it can
identify quite easily the systems changes it needs to make. "We can design a
model for the future euro-denominated capital markets and be quite precise about
what it means for securities origination and distribution, settlements, custody,
private client investment management." Some questions will only be settled
gradually and will depend on customer preferences. The bank expects institutional
investors in wholesale markets to switch quickly to euro-based documentation.
Retail investors may still want to see interest accruing from euro bonds
expressed in domestic currency.

<P> Similarly, the bank is clear about the broad implications for its payments
business with corporate customers. For three years it must run parallel payments
services in domestic currency and the euro. "We need link-ups between our IT and
that of our clients, so we can communicate in either one currency or two, with a
conversion module," says Lipp. Dresdner is working to identify which companies
will be most affected, which will want to convert to euro payments soonest and
how other companies will expect the bank to manage their accounts through
conversion. Some big companies, like Siemens, have said they do not wish to run
two sets of accounts and will switch over to the euro as soon as their financial
year permits: for Siemens in October 1999.

<P> It's a big undertaking. Lipp says: "If our clients wanted us to use
double-currency information now, it would be far more than we could deliver."

<P> Banks are trying to limit their investments. One way is to be strict about
internal information flows. Though customers may receive account information in a
choice of currencies, banks' own officers may not enjoy such a luxury.
Commerzbank is determined to offer its products in multiple currencies, not just
two. But, internally, it will not convert its stores of historical data from
Deutschmarks to euros. "If someone inside the bank needs to compare a sequence of
payments or results using old data, he must convert those payments himself into
euros," says Lipp. "That will save space and time, and instead of producing
internal convenience, we can concentrate on providing service to the clients."

<P> Working along a similar timetable, Commerzbank is now entering the final
round of planning and specifying requirements for changing programmes. Next year,
the implementation begins. That means the banks' planners and systems people must
seek agreement from business heads on the necessary technology upgrades, their
timing and cost. This means bringing together planners with a three- to five-year
time horizon, and business heads, some of whom are concerned with market moves
over the next week or the next few hours. It means tackling executives who are
far removed from the single-currency project, and who may have thought it would
never happen, and persuading them that it will happen, and that they must
prepare, whether their own country joins or not.

<P> Perhaps even more daunting are the strategic issues posed by the euro.
Fifteen months ago many bankers thought of this as a massive IT conversion,
comparable in some ways to the millennium question (banks' computer software was
not written to allow for dates ending 00 and must be revised to accept this
format), with which it is still sometimes linked. Because IT is not particularly
flexible, banks have to develop it with a strategic business view. For the
banking industry, the single currency marks the completion of the single European
market in a way that it does not for many other industries.

<P> A bank located in one Emu country operating as a foreign bank in a second Emu
country will no longer have to tap the comparatively expensive local interbank
market to fund local currency loans. Instead, it will be able to use funds raised
in its home market to make loans in euros through its branches in other euro
countries. Companies are likely to shop around more for banks' services.

<P> The build-up to the single currency forces decisions about which businesses a
bank should stay in, and build market share in, and which ones to quit. In many
businesses, banks must either expand or specialize. Certain businesses will be
affected in obvious ways, such as foreign exchange trading, especially European
cross-currency trading. Wolf-K&ouml;ppen at Commerzbank says: "Obviously six or
seven currencies will go and you cannot get that business volume back by dealing
in Asian or central European currencies, without having a basic business with
those countries."

<P> Operating in other wholesale businesses will become very different. A French
bank which is a large trader in OATs, pitching itself against other large French
banks, will suddenly find its French franc niche taken away. Instead it will be
trading in euros and facing competition from other large European &#173;  and
perhaps American &#173; firms. The bank may decide that such a dismantling of
barriers presents the opportunity to become a significant player in the global
bond markets, or it may look for a new niche.

<P> Cash management for corporate clients, which today is very much a domestic
currency business, won't stay that way. A French company may be less inclined to
choose a French bank as its cash manager, when its cash flows are largely
denominated in euros.

<P> There will be even greater concentration in correspondent banking. Today, a
large American or Asian bank might have five correspondent banks in Germany and
France, and three in a country like the Netherlands. It's a bread-and-butter
business, but one which consumes little capital and provides many banks with a
decent return as long as they have good systems and can maintain high volumes.
But competition will become fiercer. It may be that non-European banks will
reduce the number of correspondents they need inside the euro bloc, perhaps to
just one in each country. The pricing for cross-border payments is likely to
fall, and banks will have to decide whether they want to remain in that business,
how much they can invest to maintain a market position and what is the most
efficient way to operate in that market.

<P> <B>Cross-border co-operation</B>

<P> The Target system &#173; linking real-time gross settlement systems of
participating countries &#173; will handle only large-value euro payments for
central banks, large private banks and very large companies. Smaller companies
will have to go through banks' own payments systems and correspondent networks
for so-called low-value payments in euro. There are already signs of banks
clubbing together to form alliances to provide basic electronic banking services,
including payments, to each others' customers across Europe. Dresdner Bank,
Banque Nationale de Paris, Midland, Banque Bruxelles Lambert and BBV, make up one
group working together since early last year on co-operation which may extend to
some cash management services.

<P> Only large national banks would add anything to such a venture. "You need a
partner in each country, which covers the whole of that country, not just with
one or a few branches," says Lipp.

<P> Another consortium of banks hoping to use each others' networks to service
their own customers around Europe is IBOS, comprising Royal Bank of Scotland,
Banco Santander, Banco de Comercio e Industria, Cr&eacute;dit Commercial de
France, Kredietbank and Unibank. This allows a customer to access an account from
any branch of a consortium member and to execute payments transfers. According to
de Lencquesaing: "Our major objective is not to build a payments system that
competes with Swift, but to find a way to serve our customers in Europe without
buying a bank in each country. We are building a virtual bank to provide a
homogeneous service to our clients. It so happens that many of our clients will
use that for payments." That imposes several requirements on participating banks,
such as producing standardized and simplified remote account-opening procedures
and developing multilingual transactions forms.

<P> The broad problem for the banks is that technical preparations will take at
least two years. They must begin in 1997 to upgrade technology for the products
and markets of 1999. They cannot be certain what the market for banking services
will be like then nor be sure that they are modifying their products in the right
way.

<P> A related danger for banks is that business managers will try and shape each
bank's preparations and investments to protect themselves, and to ensure their
product survives in the new single-currency world, even if it has no real place.
The track record of the wholesale financial services industry in managing such
changes is poor. One European banker says: "I am mindful of Taurus [the failed
attempt by the London stock exchange to upgrade its trading and settlement
systems], where the stock exchange tried to accommodate interest groups which had
no <I>raison d'&ecirc;tre</I> in a post-Taurus world. And the whole project
failed."

<P> Banks are unsure what products to provide and to whom. Many customers remain
reserved on the single-currency project. They are relying on the banks to explain
it to them. Banks have to prepare their customers &#173; a job some bankers
complain belongs to national politicians and the European Commission. It's not
just retail and corporate customers who are lagging the banks in their
preparation. One banker recalls: "At the Madrid summit [late last year] it became
clear to me that while banks had been thinking about technical preparation,
wholesale markets, stock exchanges and companies, indeed almost everyone else
affected, were miles behind."

<P> Banks are hoping that workshops they run for customers in 1997 will deal with
more concrete, specific questions. Banks are striving to train large pools of
euro experts to put in front of clients. Some are thinking of ways to recoup
their investment. One German bank says it might charge clients Dm1,000 a day to
attend a workshop for 10 or more companies. For more detailed advice and support
to a single client, it might charge per hour of a banker's time.

<P> The risk for the banks spending most on their preparations is that the
project might be derailed, if not by obstinately high budget deficits in 1997,
then perhaps by severe social unrest in countries trying to cut social spending,
or some unforeseen political upheaval. If the single currency is to be scrapped,
banks would much rather it happened in the next three months, not in the last
three months before 1999. "From 1997 we'd like to see a more definite political
framework, because this is a huge investment," says one German banker. He adds:
"In terms of simple return on investment, no sensible banker would actually
suggest such a project."

<H3><B>Kerr's people</B></H3>

<H2>
<B>Robert Mohamed</B>
</H2>
<P>
<B>Director, debt capital markets and head, transaction management, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</B>

<P>
What's long on words and short on sex appeal? Try Euromarkets documentation specialist. You have to admit that the image is clerical grey. Say it twice out loud and you may feel your eyes begin to glaze over.

<P>
Snap out of that slumber. Ask any good executive recruiter which are the hottest job areas at the Euromarkets. Salesmen are out. Syndicate wizards are yesterday's men. Equity analysts are pass&eacute;. The in-people are proprietary traders and credit researchers &#173; and documentation specialists.

<P>
That's good news for Robert Mohamed, 35, who heads the transaction-management group at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. He found his feet after dmg recruited fixed-income supremo Edson Mitchell and his New York associate Grant Kvalheim. Previously they were all colleagues at Merrill Lynch. Mohamed had joined Merrill in 1989 and was persuaded to move to dmg by Abigail Hofman, who then defected to bzw as head of global origination this summer.

<P>
Why did Mohamed leave Merrill Lynch, the supreme international fixed-income house for new issues? Some disenchantment may have come from working with the feisty and demanding John McNiven who ran the international capital markets group with great success before leaving for Hong Kong to take over Merrill's Asian operations. But Mohamed has absolutely no regrets about his days at Merrill, and the move to dmg offered him a chance to continue working with Edson Mitchell and Grant Kvalheim, both of whom he admires. "dmg is a world-class investment bank and Edson is a true visionary in a market where such people are rare &#173; the combination was irresistible," he says.

<P>
What makes a good documentation specialist? Is it necessary to have a legal background? Mohamed considers that attention to detail, a logical eye and business acumen are the prerequisites. Although documentation specialists at rival houses are often lawyers, others come from commercial banking and accountancy. Mohamed himself was attracted to the documentation side of the Euromarkets when he completed a credit training programme with Chase Manhattan.

<P>
Although he plays down the complexities of the job, the rapid development of new structures provides a constant intellectual challenge, usually to a tight schedule. Surprisingly, the wave of recent securitizations has made his work only slightly more complicated. "The main losers will be the forests which have to be cut down to provide all of that extra paper," he says.

<P>
Most people would find the preparation of new-issue documents daunting enough but then there is the client-relationship factor, which can be extremely sensitive. When mandates have been awarded and the successful originators have flown off in a salvo of popping champagne corks to chase the next deal, the documentation specialists tie up the loose ends and ensure a smooth market launch. This involves close cooperation with the issuer's legal advisers and accountants. Any disagreement during this period may sour a relationship with the borrower and prejudice repeat business. Small wonder that the top mandate-getters value their documentation teams, or that the logical progression for a documentation expert is towards origination.

<P>
Will Mohamed eventually move that way? It's a possibility and after five years at Merrill Lynch and two at dmg he clearly has well-established connections with many of the world's most important borrowers. He currently also heads emtn origination at dmg in London. But for the time being he's simply too busy making sure that his part of the Edson Mitchell capital markets machine runs like clockwork.

<P>
Since joining dmg he has increased his team from two to seven. With the job market for documentation specialists booming, is Mohamed himself having to fend off interested parties? He couldn't be drawn but the Edson Mitchell factor alone would probably be too strong to prise him away. However, there have been rumours of some major continental Europeans waiting in the wings that are looking to bolster their own documentation capabilities. Then there's Abby Hofman in expanding mood at bzw and beginning to call up some of her old friends.

<P>
Weekend callers should be aware of Mohamed's sporting activities. At the height of his rugby career he was good enough to play for Wasps second xv at full-back. However, his first love is cricket. He plays almost every weekend during the season for a team organized by his father in Harrow. dmg's star originators will be hoping that he continues to carry his bat for the home team and hits all googlies bowled by the opposition far over the sight screen. 

<H2>
<B>Robert Gray</B>
</H2>
<P>
<B>Chairman, HSBC Markets</B>

<P>
There were two key appointments in the Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation (hsbc) group last month. One was the long-overdue promotion of Robert Gray. The other was the eye-catching hiring of Joan Beck (see below). What do these appointments signal to the market? Could it be that hsbc is finally waking up?

<P>
Up the ladder and into the chairman's office at hsbc Markets goes Robert Gray, the highly regarded Euromarket banker who is also vice-chairman of the International Primary Market Association. Gray and three senior colleagues came from jp Morgan three years ago in a blaze of publicity about sky-high salaries that seemed at odds with the bank's well-known aversion to extravagance.

<P>
Expectations on both sides were high. Gray and his team would introduce jp Morgan-style efficiency and order into hsbc Markets' loose-knit (some have unkindly called it chaotic) corporate structure of individual fiefdoms. All he had to do was to make Samuel Montagu, James Capel, Midland Montagu, Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt in D&uuml;sseldorf and Wardley Limited in Hong Kong work together as a team.

<P>
Sounds easy? Don't you believe it. Gray found that hsbc's separate business units didn't always want to work together and through their separate memberships of the International Securities Market Association (Isma) were sometimes competing with each other.

<P>
<B>Overdue changes</B>

<P>
Gray says integration is in its final stages but progress has been much slower than expected. He himself has been the subject of internal resentment from colleagues who are envious of the amount he earns and are impatient for better results. Poor bonuses last year caused considerable unrest, particularly as one of Gray's imported jp Morgan traders had incurred substantial losses.

<P>
Was Gray so frustrated by the hsbc internal corporate mishmash that he threatened to leave? Certainly abn Amro or Salomon Brothers would have fallen over themselves to recruit him. Friends in the hsbc Group say that he had an impressive sounding title but little real power.

<P>
But Stephen Green, the head of global treasury and capital markets, was shrewd enough to see that he was the one person with the authority and vision to make hsbc Markets into a Euromarket powerhouse and that he was intellectually streets ahead of any of the Samuel Montagu or James Capel old guard. As chairman, Gray now has the title and the power to make long-overdue changes. Can we expect culling of the hsbc veterans and some expensive hirings?

<P>
Even with his new authority, Gray faces an uphill struggle. It hasn't been a good year for hsbc Markets in the primary league tables, where the bank ranks fifteenth. That's two places behind bzw with which there is strong rivalry to be the premier uk Euromarket house. In 1995 hsbc Markets had finished well ahead of bzw. Another irritation was that bzw was selected to be the book-runner for the coveted $2 billion sovereign frn mandate for the uk in early October. This was a prize Gray and hsbc Markets badly wanted to win &#173; a small consolation was that the bank was a joint lead.

<P>
Gray will have his sights on bzw in 1997 but how does he feel about the Euromarket success of his former colleagues at jp Morgan? When he and his team left there was speculation that Gray's success would be measured by his performance against jp Morgan. To date it has been an uneven contest. jp Morgan ranks fifth in the Euromarket new-issue league tables and its primary volume of $27 billion is more than double hsbc Markets' $12.6 billion. 

<P>
Gray is under no illusions about jp Morgan. "It is a great franchise with very good people," he says. bzw is more within his immediate reach but even overtaking this uk rival is no longer a soft touch. Robert Diamond is now in charge and offering big money to attract top-quality traders, salesmen and investment bankers.

<P>
Gray knows he must increase his penetration of the big-ticket business, including global bonds, sovereigns, supranationals and frequent borrowers. That is why he recently recruited Paul Morganti, the originator of several of Daiwa Securities' largest and most successful issues and that house's key contact man with the Republic of Italy.

<P>
Friends don't envy Gray's task. "hsbc Markets is still a hotch-potch of disparate businesses and there's more dead wood in there than the Florida Everglades," says a former colleague.

<H2>
<B>Joan Beck</B>
</H2>
<P>
<B>Vice-chairman, <BR>
HSBC Investment Bank</B>

<P>
When Joan Beck, hsbc Investment Bank's new vice-chairman, parted company with mc Securities (now mc-bbl) and his former csfb friend and colleague Hans-Joerg Rudloff, there were rumours that the 49-year-old might go into semi-retirement. The mc Securities experience had not always been harmonious and may have left him disenchanted with niche investment banking. Beck was a big-picture banker and deal-maker after successful careers at Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and finally csfb, where he rose to be vice-chairman. Favourable share option incentives at Morgan Stanley and csfb had provided enviable financial independence.

<P>
Those who knew him well were not convinced he would step into the shadows. Beck is notoriously restless, never happier than when heading off to an airport to catch yet another plane. At csfb his air miles were  surpassed only by David Mulford, and colleagues spoke admiringly of his ability to get off intercontinental flights and go straight into either a pricing meeting or the nearest equivalent of his favourite London nightclub, Annabel's.

<P>
Beck still can't get away from the playboy image. Always one of the best-dressed international investment bankers, he has the natural confidence that comes with a successful career and the ability to speak more than half a dozen languages fluently. His close friend Peter Ogden, a former top Morgan Stanley investment banker, now chairman of Computacenter, is considered to be a ladies' man himself, as well as looking as if he stepped straight out of the pages of <I>gq</I> magazine. But Ogden defers to Beck's charm. "The standing joke among Joan's friends was that they always invited him to walk first into a cocktail party, bar or nightclub. When he had sat down at a table surrounded by new admirers we were able to impress those whom he had not invited simply by saying that we knew him."

<P>
<B>Jack of all trades</B>

<P>
However, think beyond the whirr of paparazzi motor-winds. Beck has a career statement to make, especially after the troubled waters of mc Securities. That chapter is over and forgotten and he sees a new challenge at hsbc Investment Bank. Like Robert Gray, Beck knows that it's uphill all the way. Beck made his name and his reputation in the golden days of Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse First Boston in debt capital markets. His forte is the fixed-income market, although csfb friends say that he had become an exceptional jack-of-all-trades banker who could bring home every type of mandate. "Clients liked Joan so much, and he was so persuasive, that if they weren't in need of debt financing he came away with some m&amp;a or advisory work &#173; he rarely returned empty-handed," says a former csfb investment banker.

<P>
These all-round skills may stand Beck in good stead at hsbc Investment Bank because the debt capital markets, which was his favourite bailiwick, is not his responsibility &#173; that's Robert Gray's. Beck must make his mark in equities, equity ipos and equity privatizations. According to a former hsbc insider, it would seem that he has been asked to carry hsbc Investment Bank's international equity flag, which had been dropped by Samuel Montagu and James Capel. Montagu has fallen out of contention and Capel has some secondary distribution and a valuable research franchise. "Now all he has to do is to take those and bring in a mandate such as Orange, eni, Wellcome or Gazprom," says an equity syndicate manager at a major Swiss bank.

<P>
Don't dismiss Beck lightly, even if the obstacles ahead seem like being in the Himalayas and looking up at k2. The decision to bring him into the bank was bold. Chief executive Keith Harris concedes that "some experience was needed to balance our younger investment bankers". However, experience is all very well. Beck's performance will be measured by results. The fact that hsbc Investment Bank's record in, say, international equity ipos has been so dismal may even be a plus for Beck's initial business targets. "A base of near zero is the perfect starting point," says a friend who has known Beck since his early days at Merrill Lynch.&#009;*

<H3>JAPANESE BANKING</H3> 
<H2>Has the MoF muffed it? </H2>
<H4>Years after the rest of the world financial community, Japan's finance
ministry has finally accepted that the country's banks can go broke. At
last, it is making some attempt to deal with its problems. But have recent
scandals weakened it to a point where it will be unable to act? Peter McGill
reports </H4>
Late last month Japan's finance ministry outlined plans for a body to rescue
insolvent banks. Tokyo Kyodo Bank, set up to take over the affairs of two
bankrupt credit unions, is to be turned into the Japanese equivalent of
the Resolution Trust Company (RTC), the organization the US created to handle
its bankrupt savings-and-loans institutions. <BR>
<BR>
There was no denying the need for action. Since last December, the Japanese
government has had to bail out no fewer than four credit unions: Tokyo Kyowa,
Anzen, Cosmo and Kizu. Their combined bad debts totalled almost &#165;1.5
trillion ($14.75 billion). It has also had to organize the rescue of Hyogo
Bank - the first Japanese bank to fail since the 1920s - whose problem loans
amounted to &#165;1.5 trillion. Japan's deposit-insurance scheme is now
almost exhausted, and the Bank of Japan has paid out nearly &#165;1.1 trillion
in &quot;emergency loans&quot;, a quarter of which it has already declared
irrecoverable. <BR>
<BR>
Some of the institutions expected to go belly-up have simply lent too much
against insufficient collateral. Many, though, have been crippled by fraud.
Others have advanced huge amounts to <I>yakuza</I> (gangsters) who tend
to equate loans with gifts. Because of this, Japan's RTC will use &quot;transparent
methods, including legal measures&quot; to ensure a &quot;prompt and utmost
collection&quot; of failed banks' bad debt, according to senior ministry
of finance (MoF) officials. But already, one Japanese banker has been stabbed,
and another shot dead, trying to collect debts from <I>yakuza.</I> <BR>
<BR>
The bailout will not pay for itself. Some of the money will come from the
banks that remain solvent - they have already had to increase their payments
into the deposit-insurance scheme. But it seems increasingly likely that
the MoF will have to call on public funds. <BR>
<BR>
That won't go down well with the taxpayers. The collapses of the past year
or so have totally discredited the MoF, and the public now views the ministry's
once-revered bureaucrats with almost total distrust. As one western banker
put it: &quot;I've never seen any other Japanese agency go from being almighty,
the pick of the crop, too powerful to criticize, to being the target of
nothing but criticism.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The rot set in last December, with the failure of the Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen
credit unions. Their irrecoverable bad debts of &#165;130 billion were allegedly
not the result of simple mismanagement or incompetence, but included loans
to the presidents' own businesses and friends, and at least one highly-placed
politician. <BR>
<BR>
More seriously for the MoF, it emerged that a number of the ministry's employees
had worryingly close relationships with the credit unions' bosses, especially
with Tokyo Kyowa's former president, Harunori Takahashi, a Bubble era speculator
whose EIE International property and resort empire went spectacularly bust
before he allegedly started draining capital from Tokyo Kyowa. Head of the
Tokyo customs house, Hiroaki Taya, was flown free of charge in one of Takahashi's
private jets to Hong Kong and accepted a Takahashi-paid junket tour to Kyoto
that included the services of a geisha. A deputy director of the budget
bureau, Yoshio Nakajima, accepted from Takahashi all-expenses paid invitations
to &quot;study meetings&quot;, dinners and rounds of golf. Both were disciplined
but the scandal was enough to tarnish the MoF'S reputation. <BR>
<BR>
Worse was to come. In September, Nakajima, a former officer of the National
Tax Agency's audit and intelligence department, belatedly told the tax office
that he had received more than &#165;50 million in &quot;cash donations&quot;
while at the MoF from &quot;businessmen and acquaintances&quot;. An investigation
then revealed that he had obtained about &#165;100 million in low-interest
loans. Nakajima was naturally asked why he had hidden these payments. &quot;It
is shameful, but I don't have much basic knowledge about taxes,&quot; the
MoF quoted him as explaining. &quot;I thought I did not have to declare
the money.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>&quot;Isolated&quot; incidents?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The scandal drew attention to a species of Japanese bank employee known
as a MoF-tan, whose job it is to keep as close as possible to the ministry's
key banking, securities and international finance bureaux. Each of the main
Japanese city banks has two or three MoF-tan, most of whom graduated from
the University of Tokyo's law faculty - like many of the MoF's elite. MoF-tan
were expected to wine and dine ministry officials two or three times a week
in expensive Tokyo restaurants. But recently, the bureaucrats have taken
fright, and the MoF-tan complain that they have been confined to telephone
contact with the ministry. <BR>
<BR>
What favours or information Taya and Nakajima delivered has never been divulged.
The MoF is keen to play down these &quot;isolated&quot; incidents but subsequent
press reports cast doubt on their assurances. The deputy commissioner of
the National Tax Agency, Katsuzo Wakabayashi, for example, has had a hard
time explaining why he has been renting a taxpayer-subsidized civil servant's
apartment in the heart of Tokyo for only &#165;20,000 a month, while collecting
more than &#165;10 million a year in rent from two luxury apartments he
bought for &#165;190 million. And the former head of the Nagoya tax office,
Ichizo Miyamoto, was found to have received &#165;26 million in &quot;advisory
fees&quot; from another failed credit union, Kizu, between December 1987
and March 1995, and to have borrowed &#165;60 million from the same institution
in 1990. <BR>
<BR>
The Tokyo Kyowa-Anzen collapse fuelled Japanese opposition to using public
money to rescue failed financial institutions. In April, two former entertainers,
Yukio Aoshima and Isamu Yokoyama, were elected as the governors of Tokyo
and Osaka respectively. Aoshima pledged not to use local-government funds
for any bailouts. He refused to chip in &#165;30 billion to capitalize Tokyo
Kyodo Bank, as the MoF and Bank of Japan intended, and only reluctantly
agreed to put &#165;20 billion towards saving Tokyo-based Cosmo Credit,
which had bad loans of about &#165;380 billion and had shared many of Tokyo
Kyowa and Anzen's &quot;business&quot; practices. <BR>
<BR>
The resolve of Osaka's new governor was also sorely tested by the failure
of Kizu Credit (until this summer Japan's largest credit union). Its former
president is alleged to have borrowed well over &#165;150 billion from Kizu
and its non-bank subsidiaries. Kizu's irretrievable bad loans total &#165;960
billion out of &#165;1.31 trillion in total &quot;assets&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The finance minister describes the failure, with masterly understatement,
as &quot;an extraordinary situation&quot;. To deal with it, he has called
for loans from the Osaka Prefectural Government and relief from the Deposit
Insurance Corporation. &quot;Financial institutions which had a close relationship
with Kizu&quot; will also be expected to &quot;contribute as much as they
can to the sharing of the cost&quot;. (This refers mainly to Sanwa Bank,
which was deeply involved with Kizu but flatly refused the Osaka governor's
earlier request for help. It is now expected to offer a loan of about &#165;100
billion). <BR>
<BR>
The MoF's embarrassment also extends to the failed Hyogo Bank. Two months
before the Hyogo Bank collapsed, its annual financial statement put bad
loans at just &#165;61 billion. After its collapse, Hyogo Bank's problem
loans were estimated at &#165;1.5 trillion, of which &#165;790 billion is
irretrievable. &quot;There was no way that anyone could have expected that
Hyogo Bank was about to go under only two months later,&quot; says Shinji
Okabe, assistant vice-president at Moody's Japan. Clearly, the bank's managers
should have disclosed the true state of affairs, but it is widely believed
that the MoF encouraged them not to. &quot;People might have been shocked
when Hyogo Bank announced such a high level of bad loans,&quot; says a senior
banker in the credit-analysis division at one long-term credit bank, &quot;but
you have to remember that the bank was only previously allowed to disclose
what the ministry wanted it to.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
With all this going on, it might seem as if the MoF has its hands full.
But it also desperately needs to do something about Japan's eight <I>jusen</I>,
or housing-loan companies, whose combined bad debts total &#165;7.4 trillion.
Once again, it is at the centre of controversy. <BR>
<BR>
The ministry virtually created the <I>jusen </I>in the 1970s, by extracting
capital from Japanese banks, the &quot;big four&quot; brokerage houses,
life-insurance companies and agricultural cooperatives. It promptly installed
many of its <I>amakudari</I> (former bureaucrats) in them. Then it turned
a blind eye in the 1980s as the <I>jusen </I>abandoned their <I>raison d'&ecirc;tre</I>
- to help ordinary Japanese buy affordable homes - for unfettered speculation,
investing in golf courses, resorts, luxury apartment blocks and office towers,
and even lending billions of yen to Nui Onoue, the infamous Osaka speculator.
By MoF admission, &#165;9.2 trillion of the &#165;11.4 trillion lent by
the jusen went to corporations instead of home-owners. <BR>
<BR>
At least 14 former high-ranking MoF regulators have held the title of president,
chairman or managing director at a <I>jusen. </I>Sogo Jukin, now reeling
from &#165;716 billion in non-performing loans, had at least four ex-MoF
bureaucrats among its executives between 1986 and 1991. At Nippon Housing
(net losses &#165;423 billion), the founding president and current advisor,
Keichiro Niwayama, was a former MoF liaison to the Bank of Japan. Its present
chairman, Kazuo Okajima, is from the National Tax Agency. Chigin-Seiho Housing
was founded in 1977, with a former director of the Mint, Tadashi Ariyoshi,
as president. His successor, Mitsuo Oda, also came from the Mint. When Oda
quit, his job was taken by Yoshito Amano, a former section chief of the
MoF's international finance department. The corporation he heads<B> </B>now
boasts the largest outstanding balance of loans to a single property developer:
&#165;99.8 billion to the Fuji Juken group of Osaka. <BR>
<BR>
Tomomitsu Oba, president of the Japan Centre for International Finance and
a former vice-minister of finance for international affairs, recently tried
unsuccessfully to enlist sympathy for his former MoF colleagues. &quot;Presidents
of <I>jusen </I>were my seniors at MoF by two years,&quot; he told a press
conference. &quot;Just recently one of them died. Perhaps what led to his
death was his heavy responsibility, and the demanding nature of his job.
<BR>
<BR>
A friend from a <I>jusen </I>gave the eulogy, and asked why only themselves
are compelled to suffer. Some of my former MoF colleagues are having a very
harsh life. Responsibility has to be shared. How to shoulder responsibility
depends on whether public funds will be used or not.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
That, of course, is the crux of the matter. Will the MoF have to use public
money to bail out these homes for retired bureaucrats? Whatever the public
might want, rival ministries are pushing for the fullest possible backing.
Some 45% of the bad loans to <I>jusen </I>came from 2,400 or so agricultural
cooperatives, or <I>nokyo</I> (which are regulated by the agriculture and
welfare ministries), together with Norinchukin, their central bank. <BR>
<BR>
The <I>nokyo </I>are not covered by Japan's deposit-insurance scheme. They
insist, however, that the MoF twice assured them, in 1980 and 1990, that
their <I>jusen </I>loans would be protected, and that it was this MoF &quot;guarantee&quot;
that encouraged them to step up their loans to the <I>jusen. </I>The agriculture
ministry insists that the MoF must accept full responsibility for the principal
of all loans made to the <I>jusen </I>by the cooperatives and Norinchukin.
<BR>
<BR>
On November 23, the MoF proposed yet another government-backed bankruptcy
holding company to take over &#165;1.4 trillion in bad loans to the jusen.
The collateral for these loans could be sold off over 10 to 15 years (without
depressing the property market). The remaining &#165;6 trillion in totally
irrecoverable bad loans would be written off by the creditor institutions
who would be eligible for low-interest loans from the Bank of Japan. Even
for the MoF, this latest proposal is a triumph of ambiguity, and senior
MoF official told <I>Euromoney</I> that &quot;no agreement has been reached
with the <I>nokyo </I>on the disposition of the <I>jusen </I>companies&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Later this month the MoF is expected to announce precisely how it will rescue
the failing banks and <I>jusen. </I>Perhaps its detailed proposals will
be universally welcomed. Perhaps the legal changes needed to implement them
will sail through parliament. Perhaps Japan's taxpayers will be happy to
see their money bail out mismanaged organizations. Perhaps no one will mention
the ministry's corruption and complicity. And perhaps squadrons of rosy-pink
pigs will take to the skies above Tokyo. <BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
<H3>The man with the minister's ear </H3>
Last month, just before the finance ministry outlined its latest bailout
plans, <I>Euromoney</I> put some pressing questions to Yukio Yoshimura,
counsellor to the minister (finance minister Masayoshi Takemura). <BR>
<BR>
<B>What is the ministry of finance (MoF) strategy for dealing with the problem
of non-performing loans in the banking sector?</B> <BR>
<BR>
First of all, we will set a transitional period of five years, probably
from 1996 to the year 2000. During this period, we will continue to repay
all the amount of deposits if a financial institution should fail. While
our deposit-insurance scheme has an upper repayment limit of &#165;10 million
(about $98,000)[per account], we have never used such a pay-off system,
but have repaid the entire amount of deposits. Probably, there are two reasons.
One is that the general public accept the notion that all of their deposits
are safe, so the entire amount should be repaid. The second is that disclosure
by financial institutions is insufficient, so for the moment depositors
cannot distinguish which institution is financially sound, or which institution
has a considerable amount of debt, and so on. <BR>
<BR>
There is a possibility of some failures of financial institutions during
this five-year transitional period. This year we have experienced failures
of the Cosmo and Kizu credit unions, and of Hyogo Bank. We do not foresee
such a large-size failure in the near future, but some smaller-sized institutions
could fail. Since the present deposit-insurance scheme is based on the assumption
that repayment will be only up to &#165;10 million, the interim report (of
the MoF-appointed financial system stabilization committee) proposed first
to increase the premium. The Japanese deposit-insurance premium is for the
moment one-twentieth the level of that in the United States. Even after
the recently-announced decrease in the United States premium, on average
their revised level of deposit-insurance premium will still be four to five
times higher than that in Japan. Therefore we will consider a major increase
in the deposit-insurance premium. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, the interim report proposed to set a kind of special premium
which will last for five years. And, of course, the credit line from the
Bank of Japan will increase. But if a gap still remains, even after such
fund enhancement of the deposit-insurance scheme, then we may have to consider
the introduction of public money. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What measures would require changes in Japanese law?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Well, in order to establish a special premium, we would have to change the
deposit-insurance law. If the final report proposes such an idea to the
finance minister, we will most likely submit our draft amendment to the
Diet for debate in spring 1996. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Might this not be derailed by a House of Representatives election, which
many seem to expect next spring?</B> <BR>
<BR>
It is a kind of <I>force majeure</I>. Anyway, we will do our best to expedite
the process. <BR>
<BR>
<B>With the deposit-insurance fund almost empty, huge infusions already
from the Bank of Japan, and serious fiscal problems faced by the Tokyo and
national governments, what would happen if there were an aggravated bank
run next year? Where would the money come from?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Yes, the current Deposit Insurance Corporation fund is running out because
of the Cosmo and Kizu credit union and Hyogo Bank failures, and that of
the two small Tokyo credit unions, but still the corporation has a credit
line from the Bank of Japan ... and we will not see another big failure
like that of Hyogo Bank. So if we start the process from next year, the
law will be approved by the Diet by mid-year or so for the special premium,
which will start some time in 1996; and as to the increase of the normal
premium, we can do that without changing any law. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Will this not impose another financial burden on Japanese banks, at a
time when they are already having to pay more to borrow because of their
perceived capital weakness?</B> <BR>
<BR>
It depends on each financial institution. Generally speaking, they will
speed up the process of writing off their own non-performing loans. By doing
so, they will use their capital, and some of them may have to replenish
their capital. <BR>
<BR>
<B>How will they do that?</B> <BR>
<BR>
There are several ideas. I cannot specify them. They can do it in the capital
markets. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Has not the MoF consistently restrained the banks from recapitalizing
by tapping the Japanese stock market, because you fear that this would depress
overall stock prices, and thus decrease the large asset value of the banks'
own stock portfolios? Have you now changed your mind on this?</B> <BR>
<BR>
How to strike a balance between Japanese banks' need for equity capital,
and the need for a stable condition of the stock market, is an issue that
will be discussed from now until the end of this fiscal year [March 1996].
Of course, it depends on various conditions: how the disposition of the
<I>jusen</I> [housing-loan company] bad loans will be settled, how big a
share of this should be borne by the Japanese banks, and how many banks
would like to write off such non-performing loans all at once, at the end
of March next year, or some time later. There are several ideas. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What do you want the banks to do?</B> <BR>
<BR>
The speedy process of write-off is of course desirable. But at the same
time, we have to consider its impact on the stock market and on other environments.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>A major criticism of the mof is that it has repeatedly delayed solving
this bad-debt problem and opposed such speedy write-offs, because it is
loath to make any dramatic public disclosure of the extent of the problem,
and very reluctant to take the necessary, painful measures to deal with
it. Has a consensus now been reached within the mof on necessary action?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The financial-system stabilization committee is now discussing the matter,
and will submit its final report and proposals by the end of the year. Then
we will do our best to adopt the necessary measures. The position of the
Japanese banks on writing off their non-performing loans, especially loans
to <I>jusen</I>, will be finalized by March 1996. So we do have a definite
scheme. But for the moment I cannot say with certainty how much will be
written off at the end of March 1996, because there are so many factors
still undecided. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What is the ministry's view on the Japanpremium on interbank rates? Do
you consider it rational?</B> <BR>
<BR>
It is not a new phenomenon. It probably started sometime in 1973, during
the first oil shock, and since then Japanese banks have been paying an extra
premium to the American banks. That is because of their use of the US dollar
as money to be lent by Japanese banks. Recently, the premium has increased
because of the non-performing loan problem. So the most important thing
is to address this problem. Fortunately, these days the Japan premium has
dropped considerably from its high sometime in October, when 50 basis points
was common. <BR>

<H3>MARKET MONITOR</H3><B>
 Edited by Peter Lee</B><BR>
<H4>FRANCE </H4>
<H2>Maastrickery </H2>
The French government has staked its life on bringing down the country's
budget deficit, but capital markets sources believe it is unlikely to achieve
its goals. If it doesn't, that will lead to some emergency funding and probably
some bond issues in the first half of the year. Sources at several large
investment banks say they are already negotiating with the French treasury
to handle new issues that would cover an expected Ffr15 billion to Ffr20
billion shortfall in financing the social security system. <BR>
<BR>
The government already plans to net Ffr290 billion through government bond
issues this year. But bankers predict they will need even more to cover
a shortfall in the budget that could be as large as Ffr140 billion. These
bankers expect public bond issues to exceed the planned total by at least
Ffr30 billion to Ffr40 billion. <BR>
<BR>
The bonds may enjoy a strong reception. Hopes for further French interest-rate
cuts have attracted foreign buyers. Other investors have taken some comfort
from the government's stated commitment to economic austerity. Last November,
a single foreign bank snapped up half of the Ffr17.8 billion bonds sold
by the government under its OAT auction. <BR>
<BR>
It is not clear how much of the expected shortfall will be funded through
bond issues, but the government's options are narrowing. &quot;It's not
likely that taxes can be raised any further,&quot; says one banker, &quot;and
the government has already made severe spending cuts&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Prime minister Alain Jupp&eacute; wants to raise the social contribution
tax from 1.1% to 2.4%. The government says that this will bring in almost
Ffr40 billion, but economists say that it is unlikely to contribute more
than Ffr25 billion, given the state of the economy. &quot;The government
has been too optimistic in determining economic growth,&quot; says Eric
Chaney, an economist at Morgan Stanley in Paris. The government has set
its deficit reduction policy assuming GDP growth of 4.5% for 1995, when
economists feel that the actual rate is 4% or less. One of the constraints
on growth has been poor consumer confidence following tax hikes. <BR>
<BR>
Some capital markets sources say the French government will attempt a kind
of private bond deal: Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts et Consignations (CDC),
a government finance agency, will buy an entire bond issue covering almost
half the social security debt of around Ffr150 billion. In this way, the
extra borrowing, which would detract from the government's efforts to comply
with the Maastricht criteria, would not be visible. &quot;And the government
would avoid the negative impact on the bond market that large issues to
finance the social security debt would inevitably cause,&quot; says David
Naud&eacute;, an economist with JP Morgan in Paris. <BR>
<BR>
CDC bought back some government debt last year to help the state reach its
goals. It's not certain that this below-the-line tactic will be acceptable
to French budget watchers at the European Monetary Institute. The CDC could
not be reached for comment. And the government is keeping quiet about any
plans for private bond issues. <BR>
<BR>
As a matter of routine, at the end of every year the CDC finances a portion
of the social security debt. But 1995 was the last year in which it was
obliged to do so. The government is creating a new agency, the Caisse d'Amortissement
de la Dette Sociale, to finance social security debt. This agency is planning
to tap the bond markets directly, and bankers in Paris and London are busy
at work on structuring deals. <BR>
<BR>
Additional emergency measures look likely this year. &quot;It is likely
that there will be a couple of mini-budgets in the year to come,&quot; says
Chaney. The government will attempt to raise more money through ever-increasing
taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. But such proceeds will be limited and the
government will likely resort to some form of borrowing. As one bond trader
says: &quot;There are a lot of holes to fill.&quot; <B>Andrew Rosenbaum<BR>

<H3>US REGULATORS </H3>
<H2>NYSE raps Nomura </H2>
John Fitzgibbon, who edits an industry newsletter called the <I>ipo Aftermarket</I>,
was being interviewed last month on cable TV about a popular new stock offering
when he first heard the news: &quot;We interrupt this programme to bring
you an important business announcement: Nomura Securities has been fined
$1 million by the New York Stock Exchange for financial violations.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Vindicated is the only word to express how Fitzgibbon felt. The former vice-president
of Nomura's US-based securities subsidiary, Nomura Securities International,
was one of the first Americans to work for the Japanese brokerage giant
in New York, in the 1970s. Shocked by the practices he saw there, Fitzgibbon
tried for years to expose what he claims was a pattern of securities violations.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;These types of things have been going on for 20 years,&quot; says
Fitzgibbon, who published a book five years ago about his experiences at
Nomura and - perhaps even more interestingly - his ill-fated attempts to
get regulators and Congress interested in its alleged misdeeds. The NYSE's
hefty fine against Nomura confirmed his views. &quot;Fitzgibbon has been
talking about these things for years and nobody would listen,&quot; says
the former head of international sales at a major US brokerage who worked
closely with Japanese brokers. &quot;But he was right all along.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Fitzgibbon worked for Nomura for five years before he says he was forced
out for his refusal to &quot;play ball&quot;. As detailed in his book, <I>Deceitful
Practices: Nomura Securities and the Japanese Invasion of Wall Street</I>,
Fitzgibbon says he was initially shoved aside for his refusal to falsify
a Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) report related to an convertible
bond underwriting for Mitsui in 1975. He later went to work for Sanyo Securities
America (SSA), which is part-owned by Nomura. After 12 years, during which
time he continued his investigations of Nomura, Fitzgibbon was fired after
a former Nomura executive became SSA's president. <BR>
<BR>
Nomura executives tend to dismiss Fitzgibbon and his book, saying the information
is outdated. &quot;He hasn't a clue as to what Nomura is like today,&quot;
says Ira Sorkin, who holds the newly created position of chief legal officer
at Nomura Securities International and sits on its executive committee.
Sorkin, a former administrator of the New York office of the SEC and a former
deputy chief of the criminal division in the Manhattan US Attorney's Office,
joined Nomura six months ago. He is also quoted in <I>Deceitful Practices</I>
as having told Fitzgibbon that Nomura had no compliance system in 1984,
when he was at the SEC. Sorkin says he doesn't remember the interview with
Fitzgibbon but notes: &quot;The firm in 1995 is as much like the firm in
1984 as a supersonic Concorde is to World War II biplanes.&quot; Today,
he says, Nomura's New York office is totally &quot;Americanized&quot;. The
shift supposedly began when Max Chapman, the former Kidder Peabody president,
joined as chief executive in 1989. However, the NYSE disciplinary action
involves trading that occurred after Chapman arrived. <BR>
<BR>
The leniency of Japanese regulators towards their financial industry has
become common knowledge in recent years. But it appears the US regulatory
community also had a hands-off approach to Japanese institutions operating
in the US - until recently. The Fed's closure of scandal-plagued Daiwa Bank,
followed by the NYSE's $1 million dollar fine against Nomura for its violation
of net capital rules, shows that the US regulatory attitude is shifting.
The NYSE action required Nomura to include outsiders on its board of directors
and also have outsiders review its supervisory systems, procedures and practices
- an apparent vote of no confidence in its controls. <BR>
<BR>
That's a far cry from what Fitzgibbons encountered among the regulators
in the 1970s and 1980s. He says he was frustrated, and puzzled, by their
laissez-faire attitude towards Nomura. According to <I>Deceitful Practices</I>,
Nomura's misdeeds included neglecting to license its salesmen, refusing
to institute a compliance system, selling unregistered securities, rigging
underwritings and engaging in illegal wash-sales to make the trading activity
in US government securities appear hefty enough to warrant being granted
a primary dealership. Yet the SEC never took any action, and Fitzgibbons'
attempts to get a Congressional committee to investigate the firm went nowhere.
(Although he offered up several names of willing sources for the Congressional
investigators, they said they could not get enough confirmation of his claims
and dropped their pursuits.) <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The people to blame are the enforcers,&quot; says Fitzgibbons, who
claims it was &quot;all politics&quot;. &quot;Nomura was given <I>carte
blanche</I> here,&quot; says Fitzgibbons. The Japanese holdings of US treasuries
gave Nomura and other Japanese financial institutions political clout, he
suggests. <BR>
<BR>
The NYSE was the one regulator to have taken action against Nomura previously.
In 1990, it found it in violation of net capital requirements during a time
when Nomura was trying to build up its US government trading to wrangle
a primary dealership. However, it appears Nomura did not learn from the
experience, and this time the NYSE was tougher. In both cases, the NYSE
says Nomura had been accounting for sales and pur-chases of bonds inaccurately,
to keep from placing its regulatory net capital position in deficit. (The
earlier action involved US government securities; the latter Mexican bonds.)
For the second time, the NYSE says, Nomura did not consult with regulators,
outside counsel or outside accountants on the matter. <BR>
<BR>
Nomura consented to the latest NYSE action without admitting or denying
guilt. In a press release, Nomura confirmed it had agreed to pay the fine
and to appoint an outside director to chair its audit committee and to sit
on its compliance committee. It added that since 1992 Nomura had undertaken
steps to strengthen its legal, compliance and audit departments. One such
step was to create the position Sorkin now holds. Sorkin says that the trades
in question began in 1990 and became known to senior management in June
and July of 1992. The trades were a &quot;grey area&quot; which the firm
realized regulators might take issue with. According to the NYSE's interpretation,
they would have put Nomura into a net capital deficiency of over $150 million
by October 31 1992. As a result, Nomura decided to move the trades to the
holding company to avoid any potential net capital violation even before
the NYSE learned of the transactions. The NYSE, however, says that Nomura
did not make the transfer quickly enough. Trading activity ceased in February
1993 on the instruction of the exchange. <BR>
<BR>
Sorkin says there was no literature by any regulator, or any case law, to
indicate that trades were being treated improperly. He says technical difficulties
kept the firm from moving the trades as quickly as the exchange desired.
Nomura settled with the exchange to avoid spending more money and management
time in fighting the case, he adds. <BR>
<BR>
Still, Nomura's perceived economic clout can silence its critics. Publisher
Simon &amp; Schuster originally planned to publish Fitzgibbon's book but
held it on legal review for 13 months after Nomura threatened to sue against
the author of a much more favourable book, <I>The House of Nomura</I>. Simon
&amp; Schuster then dropped the book and <I>Deceitful Practices</I> was
eventually published in 1991 by a small New York publisher, Carol Publishing.
Only 25,000 copies were released, to little fanfare. <B>Michelle Celarier<BR>

<H3>EQUITY PLACEMENTS </H3>
<H2>Riding the dual track </H2>
When a company decides to sell a division, it usually follows one of two
routes. If public equity markets are strong, it will spin it off through
an initial public offering (IPO). If equity markets are weak, it will look
for a strategic buyer which is willing to pay a premium to the stock market
valuation for a corporate asset that suits its book. &quot;Historically,
the two have been contra-cyclical,&quot; says Edward Annunziato, managing
director in mergers and acquisitions at Merrill Lynch International. &quot;When
public equity market valuations are high, you get less M&amp;A activity.
When equity market values are low, trade buyers come in and companies sell
to strategic buyers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But there may be times when certain companies command strong valuations
in both markets. Merrill thinks these conditions might occur this year in
Europe. &quot;We expect a flow of funds into Europe and emerging markets
from the US,&quot; says Michael Ryan, London head of equity capital markets<B>
</B>at Merrill. &quot;The trend for lower interest rates should also help
equities.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Increasing product competition, partly as a result of privatization, and
competition for capital will spur large European companies into restructuring.
&quot;Continental Europe offers wonderful possibilities [for restructuring]
because there are so many conglomerates. That has been a bad name in the
US for some time and may become so here,&quot; predicts Ryan. Meanwhile,
equity investors are tired of the endless stream of privati-zations and
are more interested in buying growth stocks of medium-sized companies with
proven entrepreneurial management. Spin-offs fit the bill. <BR>
<BR>
If this is more than New Year optimism, we may see competition for the same
assets this year between M&amp;A buyers and equity investors. One way for
sellers to benefit is to follow what Merrill pitches as the dual-track approach.
That is to run an IPO for a division simultaneously with marketing to trade
buyers. Under a classic dual-track deal, a selling parent company prepares
a public prospectus for a division, proceeds with a roadshow and book-building,
and offers the same documents to a trade buyer. Until the 11th hour - after
the public deal is priced - a trade buyer can win the company with a knock-out
bid. In the absence of a bid, the IPO proceeds. <BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, any company which wanted to sell an entire division would
look for trade buyers. IPO sales have tended to be for 20% to 50% of a division,
offering investors the comfort that a controlling shareholder with experience
of the business will continue to influence the company and fight for shareholder
value. But, during the hot US equity markets of 1991 to 1993, companies
began to sell 100% of certain divisions through IPOs. The same is now possible
in Europe. A key deal was Electrolux's $560 million 100% IPO sale of air-bag
manufacturer Autoliv in mid-1994. It started life as a possible M&amp;A
deal. &quot;With strong management on board, public deals of $750 million
or larger can be done,&quot; says Ryan. &quot;After a number of recent IPOs,
we've heard from trade buyers that they were upset because they had that
company in their gun-sights.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For sellers, public market disposals have some advantages over M&amp;A sales.
There are no worries about monopolies investigations. Sellers do not have
to write purchase and sales agreements. These may require representations
and warranties covering performance and indemnities against product or environmental
liabilities lasting for several years. Trade buyers may withhold some of
the purchase price in an escrow account during the contractual life of these
indemnities. Trade buyers also instigate lengthy and potentially disruptive
due-diligence procedures, delving much deeper into a company than the typical
prospectus for a public share sale. In dual-track deals, trade buyers have
to content themselves with the prospectus for the public share sale. <BR>
<BR>
Deals can go the other way. Last year, Swedish car company Volvo paid $573
million to Clark Equipment to buy out privately its share in their joint-venture
earth-moving equipment maker, VME Group. Clark had initially planned to
spin off its 50% stake in VME through a $700 million IPO - a deal that eventually
proved impossible to push through the global equity market. <BR>
<BR>
One potential drawback for dual-track deals is that sellers enjoy all the
advantages. Trade buyers and institutional investors are played off against
each other to the benefit of neither group. Won't institutions become annoyed
at investment bankers marketing IPOs to them which then don't eventuate
because higher paying trade buyers are flushed out? And won't trade buyers
disappear if sellers try to fob them off with public offer documents instead
of more complete due diligence &quot;To be honest, there haven't been enough
of these dual-track deals for investors to really notice what's going on,&quot;
says Ryan. <B>Peter Lee<BR>

<H3>FLOATING-RATE NOTES </H3>
<H2>EIB's yen handout </H2>
In 1992 when the European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a &#165;35 billion
floating-rate note paying a coupon 50 basis points below Libor, there were
few thoughts that yen Libor might ever fall below H%, making the coupon
technically negative. <BR>
<BR>
But on November 30, that is exactly what happened. Six-month yen Libor was
fixed at 48bp, technically obliging investors to pay the EIB for the privilege
of holding its paper. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, the EIB had already thought about this and decided, in consultation
with its lawyers, that no investor with his wits about him would pay an
issuer money. &quot;We considered capitalizing the difference and deducting
it from future positive coupon payments,&quot; says EIB treasurer Ren&eacute;
Karsenti, &quot;but our lawyers advised us not to.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Other EIB sources explain there would have been huge problems advertising
the bank's intentions, locating bond-holders and proving that the bearer
had held the bond during the period of the negative coupon rate. &quot;So
we decided to say that the coupon is flat,&quot; the source relates. For
the period from November to May, bond-holders will receive no coupon, but
they won't pay anything either - a saving for them of a mighty 2bp. <BR>
<BR>
Such a security might not seem a great investment prospect. It was quoted
by Nomura Securities at 98.40 to 98.60 towards the end of December, a yield
of between Libor minus 30.9bp and Libor minus 18.5bp. But Nomura reports
some demand from Germany where the absence of coupon is attractive from
the tax point of view. <BR>
<BR>
The EIB issue is the only public floater known to have been affected so
far. A World Bank yen private placement paying a coupon of 20bp below Libor
still has some leeway. Some FRNs, such as one for Cr&eacute;dit Local with
a coupon 39.5bp below Libor, have a minimum coupon - Cr&eacute;dit Local's
is 3.7%. The EIB has a number of floating-rate yen private placements but
will not say whether any of those are paying zero. <BR>
<BR>
In the swap market, the receivers of floating-rate yen indexed at sub-Libor
rates aren't as lucky as EIB bondholders. According to market practice,
endorsed by the International Swaps &amp; Derivatives Association (Isda),
the floating yen receiver has to pay the difference between the fixed rate
and the floating rate index level, including any negative amount below Libor,
unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary. <B>David Shirreff<BR>

<H3>SWITZERLAND </H3>
<H2>A test of strength </H2>
The proud and independent Swiss may yet rue the day they opted for life
outside the European Union. At least, that is fast becoming the received
wisdom among Swiss economists. <BR>
<BR>
Having recently clawed its way out of the most savage recession since World
War II, Switzerland faces the gruelling prospect of a second economic downturn
hard on the heels of the first. Last month, the Swiss federal statistics
office reported zero growth in GDP for the third quarter of 1995 compared
with the second quarter and just 0.7% growth compared with the third quarter
of 1994. <BR>
<BR>
The culprit has been the Swiss franc, which has gained 12% against the dollar
since January 1995 and more than 4% against the Deutschmark and French franc.
This is squeezing margins in the export and tourist sectors. Beleaguered
Swiss hoteliers, for example, report that overnight stays were down 6.3%
in the first 10 months of 1995 compared with the same period the previous
year. The strong franc is also making life tough for domestic producers.
Andr&eacute; Tomfort, a senior economist with Credit Suisse in Zurich, says
that capital goods manufacturers in particular are suffering from the renewed
competitiveness of foreign imports. <BR>
<BR>
Why the currency strength? Many Swiss economists blame Europe's unsteady
progress towards a single currency, with Italian investors piling into the
Swiss franc last spring because of jitters that the lira might be excluded
from the project and Germans following suit in the autumn for fear that
the Deutschmark might be included. &quot;The strength of the Swiss franc
against the Deutschmark is mainly due to fears about European monetary union,&quot;
says Thomas Rose, an economist with Swiss Bank Corporation. <BR>
<BR>
Not so, says Thomas Bieri, an economist with Union Bank of Switzerland.
&quot;Such structural reasons for the strength of the franc are overstated,&quot;
he argues. &quot;There is not much evidence for this phenomenon.&quot; In
fact, there is no direct evidence whatsoever. Because of bank secrecy laws,
statistics on foreign capital inflows into Switzerland are thin on the ground.
&quot;We can't actually measure the scale of German and Italian purchases
of Swiss francs because we do not have the right statistics in Switzerland,&quot;
concedes Tomfort. <BR>
<BR>
What evidence does exist is, at best, patchy. German and Italian retail
demand for Swiss franc-denominated assets should trigger heavier issuance
volumes in the Swiss bond primary markets. Yet there is little discernible
trace of such increased demand. According to <I>Euromoney Bondware</I>,
Swiss franc international bond issues totalled $30.1 billion last year.
This is up considerably on 1994's total of $22.8 billion, but 1994 was a
slack year. In 1993, $28.9 billion of Swiss franc bonds were issued. <BR>
<BR>
Increased demand for Swiss francs over Deutschmarks, argues Bieri, should
lead to a widening spread between long-term Deutschmark and Swiss franc
bond yields, which stands at about 230 basis points in Switzerland's favour.
Yet, he says, &quot;this simply has not materialized&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Instead, Bieri blames an over-cautious Swiss National Bank (the central
bank) for much of the currency strength. &quot;Monetary policy was probably
too tight in the first half of 1995,&quot; he says. Fearing that the introduction
of a value-added tax at the beginning of the year might stoke inflation,
the central bank began 1995 with a discount rate of 3.5% and a year-end
inflation estimate of 3.2%. This now looks wildly inaccurate, with inflation
at around 1.8%. The central bank subsequently slashed the discount rate
no fewer than four times last year. At 1.5%, it is now at its lowest level
since 1979. If German and Italian retail investors are still sitting on
the sidelines, the Swiss franc's real test of strength may be yet to come.

<H3> EDITORIAL </H3>

<H2><B>Ten years on</B></H2>
<P>
London can congratulate itself on being the world's premier international financial centre. Only part of the reason is Big Bang, which happened on October 27 1986 when London's dealing commissions were freed and the single capacity of brokers and stockjobbers was ended.

<P>
Things didn't work out quite as expected. The specialist firms were absorbed; their names disappeared; but then their workforce applied themselves to quite different areas of finance. The UK market for shares and gilts didn't change that much &#173; it is only last year that the Bank of England sanctioned the widening of the gilt repo market.

<P>
No, what changed was that Big Bang provided men, women and machines, and the catalyst of a handy regulatory environment, to fuel an explosion of creativity in offshore financial products. Eurobond trading and foreign exchange were the basis. That developed into a mind-boggling marketplace for over-the-counter trading in interest rates, foreign exchange, debt, equities and commodities. The US might see bigger bond and equity volumes, and more ingenuity in securitization and the use of derivatives. But London became the launchpad for those techniques in the international arena. London's tolerance for foreigners, and its light regulatory touch, have kept it attractive as a place to work, or rather play. Let's not kid ourselves: the global financial markets are a huge, exciting game.

<P>
The game began to grow because of the inflation, triggered by the first oil crisis, in the late 1970s and the volatility of the early 1980s. It was a classic case of oversteer in all directions as companies, banks and sovereign countries tried to position themselves in currencies and interest rates to avoid being crucified by Reaganomics. A giant industry was born, which used to be called hedging and speculation, but now is more respectably known as risk management.

<P>
Ten years after Big Bang it is time to rationalize. A single securities watchdog for wholesale financial transactions would be a start. Even better would be a single regulator for multi-product financial firms. The US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission may not be a great role model. But its record of policing the securities markets is better than that of the plethora of UK regulators and self-regulatory organizations. Is this just longer experience? One factor might be the clearer definition of Chinese walls and a better sense of what is inside information. Ten years ago the walls came down and they haven't been rebuilt. The trouble is drawing a clear distinction between the application of specialist knowledge and the abuse of inside information. While investment banks are trying to transform individual product franchises into a closer interest in the fortunes of the firm, their compliance officers are trying to discourage the passage of sensitive information from one unit to another. There are no easy answers &#173; and heavy-handed regulation isn't one of them as our cautionary tale below illustrates.

<H2>
<B>No way to run a market</B>
</H2>
<P>
On November 2 the Turkish Capital Markets Board ordered three UK firms to suspend dealing in Turkish securities. The three firms, Kleinwort Benson, SBC Warburg and Caspian Securities, were suitably astonished, being unaware that they had infringed any regulation, Turkish or British. As we went to press, the UK treasury was seeking an explanation from the Turkish authorities.

<P>
The Capital Markets Board (CMB) is trying to clean up a heavily manipulated market, as our story on page 52 relates. On the trail of what it regards as some suspicious trades, the CMB asked some foreign brokers to give it a list of their clients. The brokers refused to breach client confidentiality without being ordered to do so by their own regulators.

<P>
The CMB is understandably frustrated. It hasn't had much luck bringing prosecutions for abuse of the capital markets law. But on at least three occasions this year it appears to have overreacted to events, adding uncertainty to an already volatile market and risking alienating foreign investors.

<P>
The spat with foreign brokers will probably be quickly resolved. But the CMB's heavy-handed approach may have a longer-term, structural impact on the Turkish capital market if its version of the Glass-Steagall Act comes into force on January 2. The CMB directive, issued in July, requires banks to hive off their equities trading into a separately-capitalized firm. That may be fine in principle, to re-inforce Chinese walls and make trading profits more transparent. But, in a compromise with Turkish banks, bond trading can still be done in-house, and the capital of the securities unit may be as little as $1.3 million. The motives of the CMB may be admirable, but stability isn't helped by continually shifting the goalposts.

<H3>ON THE MOVE</H3>
<H4>AT DAVOS</H4> 

<H2>Reform versus communism </H2>
<H4>RUSSIAN DEBATE </H4>
A verbal tennis match between two leading Russian presidential candidates,
the reformer Grigory Yavlinsky and communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, made
headlines both in and out of Davos, with Russian observers judging Zyuganov
the winner. <BR>
<BR>
In a tub-thumping broadside, Zyuganov attacked the Yeltsin government's
record of reform which he said had undermined production and left the country's
social, legal and tax system in disarray. If elected he would introduce
a mixed economy with predictable business conditions &quot;where everyone
is able to function&quot;, and aim for a government which did &quot;simple
things like pay people's wages&quot;. In several plenary sessions he repeated
his support for customs barriers to protect Russia's developing industries.
<BR>
<BR>
Yavlinsky agreed that most Russians had not yet seen enough benefit from
economic changes, although he attributed this not to reform itself but the
way it had been implemented. He aimed to introduce &quot;real reforms&quot;
which would bring genuine competition and other changes which would benefit
the majority of the population. He also called for a withdrawal of troops
from Chechnya and a referendum to decide the region's fate, while Zyuganov
insisted the issue was too complex for a simple withdrawal. <BR>
<BR>
The contest continued on Sunday when the two were quizzed by US Senator
Bill Bradley, who pressed them to give quick, brief answers. The more westernised
Yavlinsky was happy to oblige - &quot;yes&quot; to support for Start 2 talks,
for example - while Zyuganov reflected another political tradition. He said
Start 2 was being considered by the Duma and &quot;my party has never voted
without consulting all the experts&quot;. But what about his own personal
position? &quot;The general secretary [of the former Soviet Communist Party]
used to take decisions on his own on all items, which led to many mistakes.&quot;
<BR><BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4>COMPANY ALLIANCES </H4>
<H3>Working relationships </H3>
Commercial alliances are touted as the latest way to increase global competitiveness,
add value, cope with new customer needs with limited resources and increase
market access. But like all endeavours reliant on human behaviour, they
have a high failure rate. Consultant Jordan Lewis led a panel which analysed
its own rules for success in the corporate mating game. Lewis presented
six main aims for long-term alliances: <BR>
<BR>
* Both companies must feel they need a partner to reach their objectives
and that the particular company they choose is the best possible alternative
<BR>
<BR>
* Each company should know that hurting the other damages the alliance <BR>
<BR>
* All issues must be resolved by reference to shared commitment, not through
the exertion of power <BR>
<BR>
* Trust is essential <BR>
<BR>
* Alliances are not just between companies but between people. Teams should
take short holidays together every year to make sure they understand each
other. The people responsible for making things work have to believe in
the alliance themselves <BR>
<BR>
* There must be a way to resolve differences between the partners <BR>
<BR>
J&uuml;rgen Schrempp, head of Daimler-Benz, said his company's cooperation
with ABB worked because &quot;we selected the right people&quot;. Yoshihiko
Wakumoto of Toshiba described his company's alliances as &quot;limited in
function&quot;, designed to develop process technology, and stressed the
need for good exit provisions. <BR>
<BR>
Marshall Cohen, head of Canada's Molson brewers, drew examples from his
company's joint venture with Fosters in Australia, which now also includes
Miller. Alliances should have their own stand-alone management run by people
loyal to the partnership rather than the parents, he insisted, and partners
must communicate informally and frequently. An alliance should look for
an early, quick success &quot;to give partners a good feeling&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
He also advised partners to put away the contract the moment it is signed:
&quot;The day you reach for the contract is the beginning of the end of
an alliance, because circumstances change and you must be able to deal with
that.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He stressed that partners must &quot;take their egos off the tables&quot;
and let the partnership's managers manage. &quot;Sometimes the head of an
owner-company can interfere more with a partnership than with one of its
own divisions, because he is competing with the other partner,&quot; Responding
to a flood of questions on this theme, he added that the ego was the most
difficult thing of all to handle &quot;because you are dealing with the
heart of human relationships: you are asking the question, how do people
get along?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4>BALKAN PEACE </H4>
<H3>Only one-year reprieve </H3>
The Balkan peace process took centre stage at this year's Davos summit,
as top-level participants continued their dialogue and the different republics
assured potential investors that it was now business as usual. &quot;Bosnia
is the best place for business in the world,&quot; insisted Hasan Muratovic,
the new prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina. <BR>
<BR>
The US mediator Richard Holbrooke welcomed the fact that both Croat and
Bosnian leaders were making their federation more of a political reality.
But his personal view was that the long history of unresolved problems in
the area would continue. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Bosnia has become a testing ground for the west's post-Cold War policy,&quot;
Holbrooke told journalists. &quot;A great deal is at stake. What happens
there will fundamentally shape France's relationship with Nato, Germany's
future foreign policy role [and] the future of US attitudes.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He denied rumours that the US had agreed to slow Nato enlargement in return
for Russian cooperation over Bosnia. &quot;It is just not true. Our enlargement
plans are established: Russia knows it. There will never be such a deal
in this [Clinton US] administration.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In another panel session, Balkan commentator Misha Glenny warned that if
no agreement was reached by the civilian parties by the end of the one-year
Dayton agreement period, &quot;the region could see war again&quot;. He
expected President Bill Clinton to keep US troops there if he is re-elected
this November because so far Bosnia has been a foreign policy success for
him. Columnist William Pfaff worried that involvement of the international
community could create an incentive for the different ethnic groups to escalate
their demands. In the event of failure, they might then pass the blame to
these bodies. He applauded the one-year deadline for troop withdrawal which
was agreed in the Dayton peace agreement: &quot;We have helped end the war
and given generous assistance. If at the end of the year they prefer to
resume war, the international community should regretfully withdraw and
let them get on with it.&quot; <BR><BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4>CREATIVITY </H4>
<H3>Busking it in business </H3>
&quot;Creativity is the DNA of everything that a company does,&quot; said
John Kao, president and chief executive of Advanced Video Communication,
at Friday morning's session on &quot;Jamming: the art and discipline of
corporate improvisation&quot;. Jamming - the US term for creative interchange
between colleagues - is a way of creating profit, he argued. <BR>
<BR>
Kao, the embodiment of manager as impresario, used the session for a first
showing of his video on creativity. The concert pianist Oswald Russell also
helped to demonstrate some of Kao's ideas by using the jazz standard <I>How
High the Moon</I> in a series of interpretations that went from straight
jazz to Chopin and Bach to illustrate the process of personal improvisation
around a theme. <BR>
<BR>
After this explosive opening, Richard Wurman, chairman and creative director
of TED conferences, Neville Isdell, vice-president at Coca-Cola and Esther
Dyson, the president of Edventure Holdings, pondered how to tap creativity
day-to-day. Wurman reckoned that the inventive manager only needs three
ideas: to be able to say &quot;I don't know&quot; to recognise what doesn't
work and to ask questions. &quot;We need to give people the confidence to
be terrified,&quot; he said. <BR>
<BR>
Picking up the theme, Dyson said people tend to be scared of the new, while
Isdell urged participants to ask the question &quot;Why?&quot; the terror
arose at all. He added that for Coca-Cola, the flop of New Coke was a &quot;great
learning experience&quot; but warned against improvising outside one's area
of expertise. <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4>COMPETITIVENESS </H4>
<H3>Tips for global racers </H3>
At the session &quot;Sustaining competitiveness in a globalising economy&quot;,
everyone agreed that the discussion was important but no one was sure how
to define the issues. Orit Gadiesh, chairman of Bain &amp; Co, pointed out
that whereas the buzz themes of the early '90s were reengineering and streamlining,
the issue for business now is growth. <BR>
<BR>
Joseph Bower, professor of business administration at Harvard, pointed to
a contrast with what he had said at the Annual Meeting five years ago. Then
he identified the CNN effect, that all knowledge has become instant. In
1990 success meant technology, access to markets, alliances and stability
of ownership. Now that everyone has these things, the question remains how
to be competitive. His solution was to offer the strategy of meeting people's
needs in different ways, rather than doing the same thing faster or cheaper.
<BR>
<BR>
A second Harvard professor, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, said sustaining competitiveness
involved three Cs - concepts, competence and contacts. Power has moved from
the producer to the consumer. When people function as consumers they reject
protectionism, while they do not when they act as workers. <BR>
<BR>
Finally John Quelch, professor of marketing at Harvard, focused on the effect
of emerging markets on multinationals. New markets need management talent
on the ground. The danger is that local competitors could erode the power
of the bigger firms, unless the latter move from a general global strategy
to a specific geographical approach. <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4>INVESTING IN RUSSIA </H4>
<H3>Russian rule-ettes </H3>
Before the fireworks of the second debate between Grigory Yavlinsky, leader
of the Yabloko Bloc and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, there was
a handy 10-point guide to those investing in Russian companies from Percy
Barnevik, chairman and CEO, ABB Asea Brown Boveri. <BR>
<BR>
* Limit your upfront investment <BR>
<BR>
* Go for companies you know <BR>
<BR>
* Look at the military/industrial complex, because they have the best technologists
<BR>
<BR>
* Stay away from fast people looking to make a fast buck <BR>
<BR>
* Watch out for environmental liabilities <BR>
<BR>
* Look carefully at the selling function, which is often absent <BR>
<BR>
* Most top managers will need to be removed. Go for young champions instead
<BR>
<BR>
* Investment in training will need to be five to 10 times more than you
think <BR>
<BR>
* Be prepared for the infrastructure to be in a poor state <BR>
<BR>
* Forget the balance sheet. Massive write-downs are required <BR>
<BR>
Barnevik then added a comparative caveat as a warning: &quot;It takes two
years to turn around a company in central Europe. It takes three to four
years in Russia.&quot;<BR>
<BR>

<H3>DIARY OF AN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT BANKER </H3>
<H2>A bouncy castle in Osaka, lollipops all round</H2> 

<B>Jean-Claude Komarovsky, to get Black Knight's major shareholder off his
back, goes to the fountainhead of retail distribution - Mrs Watanabe's playschool
in deepest Japan.</B><BR><BR>
Our president, David Komountainy, has called a Eurobond strategy meeting
in Foothills, Virginia, with our biggest shareholder, Warren Peace. He sits
perched amid a takeaway order from Doughnuts 'R' Us, which Mr Peace says
looks a good buy. Yes, I say, but you don't need to run Berky Anne-Hathaway,
the world's most successful investment fund, to know that 10 for a dollar
is great value. <BR>
<BR>
Our group-head of everything, Herby Montecarlo, wonders how America's wisest
investor will take my incisive remark. Mr Peace adjusts his glasses. &quot;I
said in 1987 I knew nothing about investment banking and I'm glad you guys
have proved me right.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Komountainy senses the gathering storm on the west side of his body and
swiftly tosses a half-finished vanilla pastry to one side. &quot;Warren,
can I introduce you to the team? You know Herby, of course, but we've made
some changes. Herby would you like to do the honours...&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Certainly. On my left is JJ Ingersoll, our head of global focus, to
his left is Roderick Daley, our head of global integrity, just across from
him is Sanfrancisco Flowers, our head of global teamwork and just to his
left is Frank Gimme, our head of intra-regional origination with responsibility
for global products. To his left, just outside the door, is Sabrina La Tour,
our newly crowned queen of derivatives and swaps. And over there is Komarovsky.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Everyone sits to attention except Sabrina, who is reading Nick Leeson's
novel. &quot;Okay,&quot; says Peace. &quot;How're you guys gonna make me
some money.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
JJ Ingersoll goes into the pitch, perhaps the biggest since last week. &quot;These
are worrying times,&quot; he notes, inadvertently pulling out a clump of
Daley's hair. &quot;The US institutional bid is flaky, globals are a no
go and a whole bunch of commercial banks just keep throwing insane swaps
at borrowers who are past caring about good market practice.&quot; Someone
in the corner begins playing a violin, but Mr Peace doesn't look to be a
music lover. A slightly hesitant Ingersoll continues: &quot;So a group of
us swung our dicks onto the squawk-box and asked ourselves what we lacked.
After a global-squawk we came up with the answer? A Japanese retail network.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Even Sabrina nods. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's been a source of concern to a firm as large and prestigious as
ours, with such global reach and integrity, to see borrowers like the Kingdom
of Vikings doing these $2 billion odd deals with Kamikaze Securities and
their brethren Nooki, Mascara and Konichiwa.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It smacks of monopoly, I say, just like ours in the yankee market, and we
ain't letting any Japanese in there, no sir, I add. <BR>
<BR>
He scowls and continues: &quot;We can't ignore it any more, it's just too
big. But penetrating the almost criminal hold the big four have over Mrs
Watanabe's coffee-table chit-chat is beyond us. However, we do have an alternative.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>A</B>t this point Frank Gimme pulls out a rapier and thrusts it through
the large stuffed grizzly bear in the corner, and checks one of Komountainy's
Picassos for eyeholes. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We headhunted someone to solve our problem,&quot; says Gimme, withdrawing
the blade. &quot;I'd like to open the door and bring him in but unfortunately,
since he arrived from Tokyo, we haven't been able to get him out of the
Burberry shop on Regent Street. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;However, I had my secretary follow him around for a couple of days
to transcribe everything Sakai-san said. I quote: 'I cannot believe the
prices and the range of goods. What please is yen sterling spot?'&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But this was not all,&quot; says JJ going in for the kill, twanging
his braces. &quot;Before he joined us he was at the Ministry of Finance
where he ran their <I>gaijin</I>-helpline. He says he was often asked the
meaning of life and how do you penetrate the <I>yakuza</I>-like hold of
the Japanese big four. Until we offered him six figures he was sworn to
secrecy. Now he's told us the one thing the MoF can't regulate: Japanese
children's savings. As you might know they have the highest savings ratio
in the world - some of them even embarrass their mothers and chide them
for buying food rather than bonds.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You give these kids pocket money and they go out and buy all sorts
of super-teiki,&quot; adds Gimme. I helpfully explain this is a savings
product manufactured by Nintendo. &quot;So far,&quot; continues JJ, &quot;this
pool of demand, which our economists estimate at &#165;9 trillion at an
average rate of pocket-money of &#165;800 per week, has been totally untapped
by foreign borrowers. But I've already spoken to McDonald's, Pepsi and Mattel,
and we know the kids will go for the names. They're the most name-conscious
children in the world.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mr Peace looks blissfully puzzled. &quot;I know what you're thinking,&quot;
swaggers Ingersoll. &quot;How are we gonna distribute this stuff. Well,
let me tell you. We're gonna leverage the firm's balance sheet and purchase
400 inflatable bouncy castles, like you see at funfairs. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Overnight we've got a sales network. We inflate them and we'll put
screens around the side, showing episodes of the Simpsons - the one with
Bart talking about Aussie dollar dual-currency plays - and a screen of prices.
Sure, the kids'll fly around, some will get cut lips as they hurtle into
each other's Reeboks in their fervour to lock in yield pick-up in a historically
low interest rate environment, but I've seen that happen to Fidelity too.&quot;
We all nod agreement. <BR>
<BR>
Gimme puts on a red nose and says that our sales force will consist of a
group of travelling clowns who will throw bearer bonds into the castle,
along with water-bombs. &quot;If we launch into Tokyo on a Friday evening
we can distribute the product over the weekend while the kids aren't at
school.&quot; Done deal. That's lollipops all round. <BR>
<BR>
<B>T</B>he great thing, I add, as Sabrina puts her bookmark in the bit where
Nick realizes the arbitrage just wasn't there, is that these kids are totally
oblivious to currency risk when they're bouncing. In fact Sakai-san says
he experimented with his own child, and found he could get her to buy an
interest rate product linked to the peso's performance in December 1994
and Boris Yeltsin's monthly alcohol intake, but only if she had been in
the castle for at least five minutes and Bart told her to eat his shorts.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Obviously,&quot; adds Ingersoll. &quot;We've got to be responsible.
We've got our franchise to protect. We'll even put a disclaimer up on the
walls of the bouncy castle stating that the price of financial assets can
go up as well as down - but hell, it's fun anyway, and you can always do
an asset swap. You know, something like that. Kids don't like to be bullshitted.
They see right through it straightaway.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Yes. These kids are adults. They know what they're doing, I say. And since
we'll be printing the prospectus in the form of a <I>manga</I> comic, not
even a court in Delaware would hold up their claims. <BR>
<BR>
But then I know it's all going too well, because I look over and Warren
Peace is examining a contract for convertible bonds and saying he prefers
fixed income. <p>

<h3> GERMANY</h3> 
<H2>Grim repo </H2>
<H4>German repo-traders are besieging the Bundesbank with complaints that
its minimum-reserve requirement is killing their business. But, asks Laura
Covill, will things get any better if the Bundesbank relents? </H4>
&quot;It's starving us out.&quot; &quot;It's squeezing us dry.&quot; &quot;It
just doesn't understand our problems.&quot; This is what you'll hear if
you ask the average German repo-trader what he thinks of the central bank.
Next will come the wistful remark: &quot;This market could easily be three
times as big.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
What so incenses these traders is the Bundesbank's insistence that repos
be subject to the same minimum-reserve requirements as sight demand<B> </B>deposits.
<BR>
<BR>
In any country, a repo involves an agreement to sell securities immediately
and repurchase them later. The party originally holding the securities pays
a return to the counterparty to compensate for what is, in effect, a cash
loan. In Germany, however, it must also lodge 2% of that loan with the Bundesbank
free of interest. According to Michael Braum&ouml;ller, head of treasury
at Salomon Brothers in Frankfurt, this 2% rule is enough to drive business
away from Germany. &quot;The minimum reserve creates a cost of 8 basis points
[bp]. When I have to forego 8bp, many trades can easily turn into loss-making
deals.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
About 50 banks claim to engage in Deutschmark repo business, but the leading
banks say only about 10 to 15 are genuine <BR>
players, and they are doing more and more of their business in London. Some,
such as WestLB, are building up London repo operations as quickly as possible.
Braum&ouml;ller estimates that only a third of the $30 billion Deutschmark
repo market is based in Germany; the rest is in the UK. <BR>
<BR>
JP Morgan, for example, covers only short positions from Frankfurt, while
all repo trading, Deutschmarks included, is handled <BR>
from London. Landesbank Hessen-Th&uuml;ringen (Helaba) does not attempt
any repo business in Frankfurt. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG) now does
most Deutschmark repo business in London, where its global repo business
is based. &quot;If it weren't for the minimum reserve, we wouldn't have
been obliged to go to London with such haste,&quot; says Holger Beck, head
of repo and securities lending at DMG in Frankfurt. The tactic appears to
have paid off however: DMG is now thought to have a third of the Deutschmark
repo market. <BR>
<BR>
It is telling that Deutsche Bank board member Rolf Breuer has been a persistent
and high-profile advocate of abolition of the minimum reserve. Since the
Bundesbank is still so sensitive about Deutsche's regrouping of capital-market
and investment-banking activities in London, minimum reserve on repos has
become a patriotic issue for some. &quot;This is about bringing money back
from abroad,&quot; says Torsten Scholz, head of repo at WestLB in Dusseldorf.
<BR>
<BR>
Others say that the German market continues to lose importance in relation
to London, and that should encourage the Bundesbank to act. &quot;If the
Bundesbank abolished the minimum reserve, it would at least have a chance
of getting some liquidity back here rather than seeing it go the other way,&quot;
says Andreas Graser, in charge of repo and securities lending at Commerzbank.
&quot;It has nothing to lose.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Workable solution</B> <BR>
<BR>
There is nothing new about the minimum-reserve rule, however. Banks operating
in Germany have had to cope with it since the birth of the Euromarkets.
And even though the requirement was as high as 12.1% until March 1994, some
repo business began to develop in Germany in the early 1990s. This weakens
the claim that the minimum reserve is to blame for the state of the German
repo market. Bundesbank directors frequently point out that 2% amounts to
no more than the working balance a prudent bank will hold. <BR>
<BR>
Several years ago the German banks reached an informal arrangement with
the Bundesbank that enables them to get around the minimum reserve most
of the time. By lending bonds to its London branch, a German bank establishes
a claim on it. It can then repatriate funds from London free of the minimum
reserve requirement. Thus funds from London may be drawn on to support a
large volume of repo trades in Frankfurt, with only the balance at the end
of the trading day subject to the minimum reserve. <BR>
<BR>
The Bundesbank is prepared to condone this &quot;balance arrangement&quot;
as long as it is sure the banks are using it only to make repo business
possible and not to circumvent the minimum reserve. Some argue, however,
that it is one and the same thing. <BR>
<BR>
The reason the Bundesbank clings to the minimum-reserve requirement has
little to do with repo business: its real purpose is to contain the volatility
of the money market. Nevertheless, traders have been told that the Bundesbank
will retain the minimum-reserve requirement until it is sure that banks
will not take the opportunity to route deposits through repos instead of
the money market. That would take those funds out of the minimum reserve,
alter the money supply figures and thus reduce the significance of M3 as
the principal indicator for German monetary policy. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Bundesbank is between a rock and a hard place,&quot; says Oliver
d'Oelsnitz, head of government-bond trading and financial innovations at
DG Bank in Frankfurt. &quot;On the one hand they want to protect their sovereignty
and on the other hand they would like to promote Frankfurt as a financial
centre. &quot;Its philosophy on the minimum reserve and repos is that if
it ain't broke, don't fix it. But the market has been trying to convince
the Bundesbank that [the system] <I>is</I> broke.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Stung by criticism that it does not understand the repo dealers' concerns,
the Bundesbank has initiated a voluntary survey of the Deutschmark repo
market, as used by German banks. It sent out a questionnaire to dealers
in February and March this year asking them for detailed information on
the volume of trades with various sets of counterparties; which currencies
the deals were in; whether demand for cash or for securities was behind
the deals; and where the deals originated. Other questions sought dealers'
opinions on developments in the market, evidently attempting to gauge the
effects of the minimum reserve. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Defining the problem</B> <BR>
<BR>
One common complaint is that while the Landeszentralbank Hessen (LZB), the
Bundesbank's regional branch in Frankfurt, understands the damage done to
the local market by the minimum reserve, it does not pass on this information
to the Bundesbank proper. It is the LZB which maintains the day-to-day links
with the banks and which therefore is more likely to hear their comments
on the workings of the market. <BR>
<BR>
The survey is over, but the Bundesbank is still analyzing the answers it
received. There is disappointment at the central bank that many banks refused
to respond to the survey and concern that it may still not provide sufficient
clues about changes in the flow of funds from money market to repo market
if the minimum reserve on repo is lifted. Indeed, Bundesbank sources hint
that the onus is now on the banks to prove that the minimum reserve damages
German-based repo business. <BR>
<BR>
Since Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, is lobbying for the planned
European Central Bank to use a minimum-reserve requirement for all deposits,
it would be extremely unlikely for the Bundesbank to abolish it, even partially,
at this stage. Nevertheless, some German repo traders are confident that
Tietmeyer will exempt repo business within a matter of months. <BR>
<BR>
In theory, liquidity should then flow back to Frankfurt, Dusseldorf and
Munich. At present, the minimum reserve depresses yields on repo business
by between 6bp and 8bp, depending on the maturity of the paper, traders
say. If and when it is lifted, Frankfurt repo prices will be about the same
as London's. Since half of all Deutschmark-denominated bonds are placed
in Germany, argues d'Oelsnitz of DG Bank, there is potential for repos to
be repatriated. &quot;The market is where the cash is.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But, others suggest, there will still be little interest within Germany,
where most counterparties are cash providers such as banks. Most demand
comes from German institutions looking for &quot;specials&quot;. They usually
find them outside Germany. <BR>
<BR>
German corporates are so rich in cash that they find it impossible to place
as much cash as they would like in exchange for repos; moreover with the
minimum reserve, &quot;we're not in a position to offer a reasonable price
to the corporates&quot;, says Scholz of WestLB. <BR>
<BR>
Germany's universal banks are also cash providers, since they can coordinate
their cash and securities portfolio without having to do deals with outside
institutions. &quot;If the market is short of securities, we can simply
take them out of inventories at our trust bank,&quot; says Matt Keller,
global head of repo at DMG. The German universal banks which have no trust
bank typically deal with investment bank counterparties in London. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Learning curve</B> <BR>
<BR>
It is indicative that the balance arrangement, which was supposed to cancel
out the disadvantages of the minimum reserve, has been in place for several
years without luring repo users back to Germany. A Frankfurt trader argues
that the balance system does not entirely make up for the minimum reserve,
as there is the cost of doubling up with traders in London, plus tax disadvantages.
All in all, repo trading is still more expensive than it need be, he says.
<BR>
<BR>
If and when the minimum reserve does fall, the cash-rich German corporates
will come under pressure from the banks to return to their German &quot;house
banks&quot;. But those banks will have to begin their marketing efforts
from scratch. Since they have been unable to take cash in domestic repo
deals for so long, links have been severed. A senior treasurer at a large
Munich-based corporate says he does no repo business at all with German
banks, mainly because of their lack of expertise. He goes straight to bulge-bracket
firms in London. The same story can be heard from bankers. DMG's Keller
says that settlement problems and lack of expertise are the main problems
in the German market (see box opposite). <BR>
<BR>
The removal of the minimum reserve will also mean tough decisions for Germany's
universal banks. Until now, Germany's 3,000 mostly tiny savings banks and
credit unions have shown little interest in repos. The Landesbanks manage
liquidity for the savings banks, while DG Bank fulfils the same function
for the credit unions. Scholz of WestLB says that so far it has not been
a priority for his department to acquire repo business from the savings
banks, since that would presumably be at the expense of WestLB's treasury
department. <BR>
<BR>
But when the EU's capital-adequacy directive becomes law in Germany by the
beginning of next year, these small banks too will have to back their positions
in securities with equity capital. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Secured products</B> <BR>
<BR>
That is a reason to avoid using capital for refinancing and to do secured
business as much as possible. Previously, banks engaged in unsecured securities
lending, but they are now keen to use instruments, such as buy-sellbacks
(where the bank provides cash to buy securities), which use up less capital.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The repo business is bound to increase due to the need for banks to
move their trading into secured products,&quot; says Braum&ouml;ller of
Salomon. <BR>
<BR>
At the same time, local banks are experiencing a fall in cheap deposits,
as customers abandon their savings books in favour of higher-yielding investments.
<BR>
<BR>
Treasury departments may find themselves competing with fixed-income departments,
which usually take responsibility for repo business at German institutions.
Already, internal controllers are putting pressure on traders to identify
the best refinancing rates offered in the entire market. &quot;When the
controllers confront traders with the cost of capital, that will be the
day when things change,&quot; says d'Oelsnitz of DG Bank. Walter Kraushaar,
DMG's head of equity repo trading, confirms that change is happening gradually
at DMG in Frankfurt. <BR>
<BR>
If the lifting of the minimum reserve does enable German banks to offer
competitive rates to more counterparties, the result will naturally be more
competition, not just within institutions, but throughout the market. <BR>
<BR>
DMG's Beck concludes that margins will get narrower for everyone. The typical
margin on a Deutschmark repo deal, he says, is already down to 5bp and falls
to as little as 2bp in &quot;very competitive situations&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, German institutions will have to undercut London-based firms
if they hope to snatch business back. &quot;If prices [in Germany and London]
become the same after the abolition of the minimum reserve, then everyone
will have to stay in his own market,&quot; says Beck. A price war seems
inevitable. <BR>
<BR>
If that's what changing the minimum-reserve requirement leads to, German
bankers may wonder why they bothered.  <HR>
<H2>Settlement joins the migration </H2>
It was no coincidence that Rolf Breuer, a Deutsche Bank board member but
also chairman of the German Stock Exchange (Deutsche B&ouml;rse), chose
a recent stock exchange event to renew criticism of the minimum reserve
requirement. Deutsche B&ouml;rse, too, is upset that the minimum reserve
is robbing its settlement house Deutsche Kassenverein (DKV) of a huge volume
of bond settlement business. <BR>
<BR>
According to DKV's chief executive J&ouml;rgen Blitz, the minimum reserve
requirement on German repos is to blame for the fact that DKV settles only
a minority share of the Deutschmark-denominated bond market. Because the
German repo business has been transferred to the Euromarkets, argues DKV,
its arch-rival, Euroclear, now owes 60% of its Deutschmark bond settlement
volume to the repo business. <BR>
<BR>
Although the vast majority of equities repos denominated in Deutschmarks
are still settled through DKV; that is small comfort because the fixed-income
market involves much larger volumes. <BR>
<BR>
Blitz hopes that price competition will help and says that he has succeeded
in reducing settlement prices to a lower level than rival settlement houses.<B>
</B>Yet market participants argue that a critical mass is more important.
&quot;Even if DKV offered settlement for nothing, the market wouldn't automatically
go there,&quot; says Holger Beck, head of repo and securities lending at
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Frankfurt. <BR>
<BR>
According to Beck, even a big market player such as DMG is not powerful
enough to dictate where the market will do its settlement business by leading
the way to one or another settlement house. So like others, DMG splits its
Deutschmark settlement business between Euroclear and DKV to reflect the
division in the repo market. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps wisely, Blitz is not waiting for the Bundesbank to remove the minimum
reserve in order to see a surge in settlements activity. Instead, he believes
that most of the potential for new business will eventually come from the
40-odd institutions that trade remotely on the Deutsche B&ouml;rse and DTB
- the German derivatives exchange - via access points in London,
Paris, Amsterdam, Zurich and New York. Remote dealers on Deutsche B&ouml;rse's
IBIS electronic trading system have an automatic link to DKV and can settle
trades on DKV's Cascade system using the same terminal. <BR>
<BR>
But the catch is that DKV users must also have an account at one of the
Landeszentralbanken, the regional branches of the Bundesbank, and an account
is granted only to banks and brokers which have a functioning back office
in Frankfurt or another German city. <BR>
<BR>
That explains why German institutions can settle via DKV (even if the trades
are done in London) but foreign institutions without a Frankfurt operation
may not. &quot;That will change at the very latest when we have a single
currency,&quot; says Blitz. <BR>
<BR>
But some traders say nothing will change as long as the repo business suffers
from a lack of settlement efficiency, both at DKV and at its foreign competitors,
Cedel and Euroclear. While the DKV can offer real-time settlement for trades
between two DKV users, same-day settlement against cash on a routed order
is still not possible. <BR>
<BR>
Blitz promises that by the end of this year, DKV will have installed a new
delivery repo system allowing both sides of a repo deal to be done with
a single order, with the report issued before maturity and a re-purchase
order generated automatically on the agreed return date. At a later stage,
DKV will introduce tri-party repos, which are already a strong source of
new business at Euroclear.

<H2>Yugoslav debt litigation</H2>
<H4>
At the heart of the current dispute over ex-Yugoslav debt is an old legal
chestnut: joint and several liability. The litigation is as confusing as
the civil war, but at least it is being fought in the courts. </H4>
<B>
By Christopher Stoakes </b><BR><BR>
At the end of March the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) issued a writ
against the Republic of Slovenia, Banka Slovenije (the Republic of Slovenia's
central bank), various other Slovenian banks and almost 400 commercial banks
around the world. The NBY is the central bank of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY), i.e. Serbia and Montenegro. Its fellow plaintiffs are
FRY commercial banks: Beograndska Banka, Montenegrobanka, Jugobanka and
Vojrodjanske. Various aspects make this action appear confusing: the mix
of central and commercial banks as plaintiffs and defendants; the apparent
involvement of questions of state succession now that the Socialist Republic
of Yugoslavia (SRY, former Yugoslavia) no longer exists; and the role of
the NBY as paying agent under that agreement. But in fact the action is
simple. It is about breach of contract and joint and several liability.
<BR>
<BR>
Joint and several liability has surfaced most recently in the context of
large awards against accountancy and law firms for negligence. Because these
firms are partnerships, each partner is jointly and severally liable for
the whole award. The plaintiff can seek recompense from each partner for
the full amount and in that way ensure complete recovery. In the case of
the accountancy firms this liability has generally arisen in the context
of audit work. Sometimes the shareholders have brought an action, alleging
that the accounts gave a misleading view of the company. Sometimes an acquirer
of a company has sued the target's auditors where the target has turned
out to be a dud. In each case the action is generally in tort (from the
French for &quot;wrong&quot;) because there is no direct contractual relationship
between the auditor and the plaintiff. The plaintiff can succeed only by
showing that the auditor owed the plaintiff a duty of care and was in breach
of it. KPMG's decision to incorporate its audit practice does not protect
the audit company or the negligent auditor from liability, but incorporation
does protect those partners not otherwise involved in the negligent act.
<BR>
<BR>
Joint and several liability can also arise in contract. Until 1988, borrowing
by the SRY was haphazard and carried out at central and commercial bank
level in an uncoordinated way. In the early 1980s a Croatian bank teetered
on the brink of collapse. This prompted an attempt to coordinate international
borrowing across the SRY which culminated in a number of refinancing agreements,
entered into between 1983 and 1985. <BR>
<BR>
These provided for joint and several liability on the part of the borrowers.
This was important for the lenders. It meant they could look to any borrower
for repayment of the whole. But - and this is the point relevant to
the current litigation - it was important for the borrowers, too. If
you are all, individually, liable for a debt, you make sure you stick together.
&quot;It means everyone stays in line, otherwise the last one left has to
put out the lights,&quot; says Christopher Grierson, an international banking
litigation partner at Lovell White Durrant, the UK firm advising the plaintiffs
in the action. This was the principle underpinning the New Financing Agreement
(NFA) of 1988, alleged breach of which is the basis of the current action.
<BR>
<BR>
Under the NFA some of the borrowers were entitled to substitute other indebtedness
- for instance, bonds issued in the capital markets - for debt
under the NFA. The effect of any such substitution was to reduce the debt
across the board for the benefit of all borrowers. Indeed, by substitutions
which exploited variations in the dinar exchange rate, the overall debt
under the NFA was reduced from $7 billion to just over $4 billion by the
time of the break-up of the SRY in 1992. <BR>
<BR>
One of the consequences of the war has been the freezing of assets by, among
others, the Bank of England, which has hit Serbia and Montenegro hard. However,
the asset freeze and the intense negotiations over how the SRY's assets
should be divided up have nothing to do with the litigation except insofar
as the assets will help to discharge liabilities under the NFA. In an ideal
world, the division of the assets and the NFA litigation would be resolved
by sitting around one table. <BR>
<BR>
More relevant is the destruction the war has caused. Its effects have not
been borne evenly across what was the SRY. Slovenia, for example, escaped
relatively unscathed. It therefore has a much greater possibility of rehabilitating
itself with the international capital markets. To that end, last year Slovenia
and the Slovenian banks entered into a side agreement with the SRY's commercial
lenders - the 385 commercial banks on the receiving end of the writ
- called the Slovenian Exchange Offer (SEO). <BR>
<BR>
The SEO is due to take effect this month (June). Under its terms Slovenia
will take over 18% of the SRY's debt with the commercial lenders and in
return be discharged by them from the NFA. Slovenia intends to tap the Euromarkets
later this year, hence the importance of disengaging itself from the NFA
which carries the risk of lumbering Slovenia with the credit-rating of the
weakest borrower, because of the joint and several liability. Now that Croatia
is heading down the same path as Slovenia there is a risk that it too will
be joined in the action. <BR>
<BR>
The heart of the NBY's claim is that Slovenia is procuring a breach of the
NFA. The NFA was premised on the understanding amongst all SRY borrowers
that all of them would remain jointly and severally liable for all of the
debt until it had all been discharged. The SEO flies in the face of that.
All borrowers agreed that if an agreement like the SEO were contemplated,
it could be undertaken only with the approval of the NBY, whose job it is
to ensure that all borrowers are treated fairly and equally. Finally, the
SEO interferes with the NBY's role of paying agent under the NFA. &quot;The
idea,&quot; says Grierson, &quot;is that everyone should sit at the table
until the end.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There are three possible remedies. The first is that the SEO is declared
null and void, which would have severe consequences for any Slovenian bonds
once they were in the market - SRY debt is trading at half its par
value. Secondly, the NBY could obtain damages. Finally, the breach could
be regarded as a breach of such a fundamental term of the NFA that the NFA
could itself be discharged, so freeing the borrowers from their liabilities
under it. Chemical Bank, advised by Clifford Chance, is coordinating the
commercial banks' response to the issue. Watch this space. <p>

<H4>PRIVATIZATION </H4>
<H3>Why PT Telkom flopped </H3>
In the end, wags said, there were more global coordinators than investors
in PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia's November initial public offering (IPO).
And though the coordinators were visible and named - local firms Bahana,
Danareksa, Makindo and Jardine Fleming Nusantara along with Merrill Lynch,
Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and SBC Warburg - it was more difficult to
find institutional investors willing to admit that they had participated
in Asia's largest international equity offering. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Things changed so quickly in the last few days before the issue that
we decided to wait and see what happened in the secondary market,&quot;
says the chief investment officer of one fund management company in Hong
Kong. &quot;Investment banks are certainly the largest holders of Telkom
stock at the moment.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It was a sentiment shared by many. Despite a year's intensive preparation
and build-up, during which the investment banks were paid fees of over $50
million and public relations companies received $6.6 million merely to publicize
the issue in Indonesia, the offering was dogged by last minute alterations.
The prayer recital which immediately preceded the domestic Jakarta and Surabaya
listings - it also debuted on the London and New York stock exchanges -
suggested the company had come to have little faith in the efforts of its
mortal advisers. <BR>
<BR>
Only a week before the issue, they were still talking confidently of a near
$3 billion deal with pricing at the top of its indicated range of Rp2,200
to Rp2,800 ($19.5 to $24.5 per ADS). This was in the face of a protracted
stock market decline in the run-up to the IPO and the across-the-board failure
of recent new issues on the Indonesian market. The Jakarta Composite index
fell 1.53% on the day before listing, after dropping 4.4% the previous week.
Of the six IPOs on the local market since September, five were trading below
their offering prices. &quot;Telkom's advisers were misreading the market
right up until the last moment,&quot; says the investment officer of an
Indonesian fund in Hong Kong. <BR>
<BR>
That Telkom's pre-launch aspirations were wildly over-ambitious was plain,
critics say, given the particularly poor performance six weeks earlier of
the year's biggest IPO to date. Billed as a tasty appetizer to Telkom, the
$224 million privatization of tin-mining company Tambang Timah through an
IPO listed in Jakarta and London in October, upset investors. Though the
$160 million overseas portion of the IPO was said by lead manager BZW to
be more than four times oversubscribed, the share price fell by 17% from
its initial offering price of Rp2,900, after only five days of trading.
<BR>
<BR>
Sanity did in the end prevail on the Telkom deal. A day before the listing,
reportedly on the orders of President Suharto, the Indonesian government
cut the size of the international tranche by more than half to 30 million
ADSs and priced these at $18 - below the indicated range. The size of the
domestic portion was left unchanged at 1.17 billion shares though these
too were priced under their indicated range at Rp2,050. <BR>
<BR>
While this meant that only 19% of Telkom's enlarged share capital was listed,
as opposed to the initial target of 27.5%, it also resulted in what many
fund managers say is an ungainly split in favour of the domestic market.
&quot;In a market like Indonesia where foreign investors account for up
to 90% of daily turnover, big issues need to have significantly larger overseas
tranches,&quot; says one Singapore-based fund manager. &quot;And though
one of the key aims of such privatizations might be to develop the local
capital market, an unsuccessful deal is of no use to anyone.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The government's decision to appoint so many global coordinators was also
attacked by detractors. Many said that the lack of one strong coordinating
house caused the issue to lose focus and produced confusion in the minds
of many investors. &quot;No-one could be certain of how much support was
really there in the run-up to the listing because there were so many conflicting
reports and, ultimately, conflicts of interest between the lead underwriters,&quot;
says the head of research at a foreign joint venture securities house in
Jakarta. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps it was as well, though, that there was strength in numbers for the
local listing. Strong support was reportedly required to keep the stock
at or around issue price after its launch. Two days after issue, the stock
was back down to Rp2,050 from a brief high of Rp2,200. But trading was thin.
Only 111 million shares and 4.5 million ADSs changed hands in the first
trading sessions in Jakarta and New York respectively, leading observers
to conclude that the pre-launch bullishness of the coordinators was anything
but genuine. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There was little volume because there was little interest even at
the reduced prices, and end demand at the initial prices was even weaker,&quot;
says the head of research in Jakarta. &quot;The underwriters had claimed
that the issue was fully covered by demand. The facts suggest otherwise.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
While the same underwriters can claim credit for averting what would otherwise
have been a total flop, the Indonesian authorities might decide that changes
are required as they proceed with their ambitious plans to privatize more
than 200 state companies. &quot;Telkom was supposed to be the curtain-raiser
for more than $25 billion worth of new privatization issues,&quot; says
the research head. &quot;And it should be hoped that the government has
learnt some hard lessons from this exercise.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Not least, he says, the Telkom deal's unwieldy structure needs to be revised.
&quot;Merrill Lynch, as sole global coordinator, did an excellent job on
the privatization of Indosat [in 1994], and there was no reason to meddle
with this structure.&quot; The figures bear him out. Though offered at the
top end of its indicated range at $32.05, over 800 institutional investors
placed orders worth $9.7 billion for a more-than-eight-times oversubscription
to the $825 million worth of Indosat stock listed on the New York Stock
Exchange (a further $337 million was raised through an offering via the
Jakarta Stock Exchange). Investors were rewarded when the stock rose 15.8%
on its first day of trading and subsequently reached a high of $40.75 in
1995 before retreating to $35.125 in early November this year. <B>Tony Shale</B>

<H4>NASDAQ </H4>
<H3>Success despite scandals </H3>
&quot;From what you read in the press, you might think we were on our last
leg,&quot; says Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of
Securities Dealers (NASD), parent organization of the Nasdaq electronic
stock market. &quot;That isn't the case at all.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Hardiman's remarks are a reflection of Nasdaq's unusual position: it is
experiencing both worrisome scandal and splendid success. Nasdaq and a number
of its member broker-dealers have been at the centre of investigations and
legal actions by government agencies and investor groups in the past year,
but at the same time, it has been the most successful of America's three
national stock markets. <BR>
Hardiman rattles off impressive statistics: the market value of Nasdaq's
listed companies stands at $1.13 trillion dollars, up from $786 billion
at the end of 1994. The Nasdaq Index rose 37% in the first 10 months of
1995, a better performance than that of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),
the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. Trading
volumes have also been setting records: if current trends hold, 1995 will
be the first year Nasdaq's annual trading volume exceeds that of the Big
Board. Although market capitalization lags, Nasdaq boasts both more companies
and more issues than are traded on the NYSE. <BR>
<BR>
Nasdaq has plans for new market expansion. Officials are eager to develop
two market sectors in the coming years: emerging high-tech companies - which
have long been a key market sector - and international listings. Nasdaq
already carries 110 ADRs and another 262 foreign securities. Hardiman believes
there could be as many as 100 new international listings including both
ADRs and direct listings in the next year. <BR>
<BR>
But Nasdaq has its share of problems too. In 1994, the US Justice Department
and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating allegations
of illegal trading activities after a report by two academics, William Christie
of Vanderbilt University and Paul Schultz of Ohio State University, revealed
unusually wide bid/ask price spreads. Allegations of price fixing on almost
1,600 Nasdaq stocks, and charges of other anti-competitive practices, resulted
in a class action suit against 33 market-makers, including some of Nasdaq's
biggest member firms. <BR>
<BR>
Not that Nasdaq had been immune to scandal in the past. By its own account,
it was called on to administer self-disciplinary action 5,361 times between
1988 and 1993. In that same period, only 3,285 such actions in total were
taken by all other US stock exchanges. It is the scale and scope of the
latest charges which threaten the market itself. <BR>
<BR>
These pressures have prompted Hardiman to oversee a far-reaching series
of reforms which include restructuring NASD and Nasdaq and reconstituting
their governing boards, and adopting new regulations designed to improve
the trading environment. The number of Nasdaq governors will be increased
by 50%, and the organization will be rebuilt around two main subsidiaries:
Nasdaq and NASD Regulation Inc. <BR>
<BR>
Essentially, these reforms - approved by NASD's board in November (with
votes on by-law changes expected in January) - will separate trading and
regulatory activities and provide much clearer rules on trading. They incorporate
many of the recommendations contained in a report prepared for NASD earlier
this year by a committee headed by former US Senator Warren Rudman. <BR>
<BR>
By the end of April 1996, a majority of the NASD board will be made up of
&quot;non-industry&quot; members (such as company and investor representatives,
lawyers and academics). This should also be true for the Nasdaq subsidiary.
The board of NASD Regulations Inc (the self-regulatory market subsidiary)
is not expected to be finalized until early 1997. <BR>
<BR>
These reforms, says Hardiman, will give Nasdaq &quot;a degree of professionalism
and consistency&quot; it has lacked. After all, he adds, &quot;NASD has
become a quasi-public institution&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The SEC refuses to comment on the proposed Nasdaq reforms. SEC officials
point out that these reforms have not yet been officially approved and implemented.
Moreover, the SEC, in light of on-going Justice Department litigation, does
not want to interfere in the market-maker prosecutions. <BR>
<BR>
However, a number of influential members of the financial community now
favour a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; approach. Richard Breeden, a former SEC
chairman, has warned that prosecution could kill America's venture capital
industry. Merrill Lynch and other large brokerages and market-makers have
publicity agreed to support reforms. <BR>
<BR>
The scandals obscure the fact that the Nasdaq market has enjoyed a banner
year. Indeed, Nasdaq's success as the premier market for emerging companies
in the US is being copied overseas. <BR>
<BR>
Broker-dealers in Europe, Japan and Singapore are working towards developing
their own electronic trading systems, known respectively as Easdaq, Jasdaq
and Sasdaq. <BR>
<BR>
Easdaq is expected to begin trading in mid-1996, with some 20 listed companies,
all incorporated in Europe. By the end of the first 12 months of operation,
70 companies are expected to be listed. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It will be a quote-driven market akin to Nasdaq,&quot; says Tony Preece,
consultant to market operations at Easdaq. <BR>
<BR>
Easdaq will be the first pan-European emerging companies market. It is expected
to fill a much-needed gap in European capital markets. &quot;We won't have
to go looking too hard to find companies that want to list,&quot; says Preece.
Many smaller European companies are already listed on Nasdaq in the US.
Easdaq also expects to welcome non-EU companies from eastern Europe. <BR>
<BR>
Structurally, Easdaq will resemble Nasdaq in many ways. It will consist
of the membership organization, EASD, and a market governing authority.
The latter will be set up under the Belgian Banking Commission (the country's
SEC equivalent), as Easdaq is incorporated in Belgium. <BR>
<BR>
EASD membership is international and the broker-dealer list already includes
such names as ING and UBS. Shareholders include Baring Securities, ING and
Nasdaq itself. <BR>
<BR>
Neither Preece nor other Easdaq officials seem overly concerned by Nasdaq's
regulatory problems. The important thing, they say, is that Nasdaq has established
an outstanding track record bringing emerging companies to market. Nasdaq
is the home market for such corporate stars as Apple, Microsoft, MCI Communications,
Sun Microsystems and US Healthcare. <B>Josh Martin<BR>

<H4>ITALY </H4>
<H3>Eni opts for caution </H3>
Since 1992, Italy's oil and gas group Eni has been transformed from a corruption-riddled
loss-maker into a highly-respected and profitable multinational. But even
still the Italian government opted for caution in its privatization last
month, setting a price of L5,250 per share at the bottom of the guideline
range. <BR>
<BR>
The Italian stockmarket had fallen by around 10% since the summer, and prime
minister Lamberto Dini's technocratic government was looking ever shakier,
having only narrowly survived a no-confidence vote in late October. The
government was also anxious not to jeopardize the country's plans for future
large privatizations, the proceeds from which it badly needs to reduce Italy's
public debt in preparation for European economic and monetary union. <BR>
<BR>
The decision to privatize Eni, the world's eighth-largest oil company, looked
optimistic when it was taken three years ago. For while the company's bizarre
logo of a dog with six legs once symbolized Italy's post-war prosperity,
the group later became heavily embroiled in political corruption. The &quot;clean
hands&quot; investigation in 1992 led to the removal of the entire top tier
of management, including the chairman Gabriele Cagliari, who committed suicide
in a Milan prison in July 1993. <BR>
<BR>
Since then, however, the dynamic new managing director Franco Bernabe has
overseen an extensive restructuring programme involving a retreat from non-core
activities and the loss of a third of the workforce. Eni reported record
annual profits last year of L3,251 billion, and in the first half of 1995,
pushed up net profits by 54% to L2,760 billion. The turnaround enabled Eni
to come to the market before the state-owned telecom group Stet and national
electricity company Enel, whose privatizations have been held up by legislative
delays but are now scheduled for next year. <BR>
<BR>
The Eni sale involved 15% of the company's equity capital and raised around
$3.5 billion. Although considerably smaller than the 20% originally envisaged,
it was still the largest initial public offering for cash ever undertaken
in Europe. A green-shoe facility will allow the offer to be increased to
17.5% if the government decides there is sufficient demand. <BR>
<BR>
The government and its global co-ordinators, CS First Boston and the Italian
banking group IMI, have drawn praise from some bankers for adjusting to
difficult market conditions and attempting to preserve the after-market.
They say that the low price should ensure that Eni offers value to investors
in the medium and long term, and will be remembered in the future when the
Italian government has less attractive assets to sell. <BR>
<BR>
Following a worldwide roadshow, during which Bernabe impressed investors
with his expertize in oil business management, the deal was completed in
record time. But given that the book had been building steadily during the
marketing period, and preliminary soundings had indicated an issue price
of between L5,400 and L5,500, the final offer price surprised many participants
in the deal. <BR>
<BR>
The price represents a large discount to net asset value. Eni began trading
on a P/E ratio of 10 times 1995 earnings and 8.7 times prospective 1996
earnings. This appears cheap compared to similar international stocks which
are on multiples of around 15, but less so when the unprecedented size of
the transaction and uncertainty over what the Italian market may do over
the coming months is taken into account. &quot;In the long run, Eni is a
cheap stock,&quot; says one London-based trader. &quot;But investors will
probably have to wait until the next election [slated for February] is out
of the way before they see any significant gains.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The government deemed the low price necessary in order to alter the attitude
of Italian retail investors to privatization. &quot;We decided not to push
the price because we wanted it to be a success,&quot; said prime minister
Dini just after the price was set. <BR>
<BR>
With many of the privatized banks and financial institutions currently trading
below their issue price, past experience of Italian sell-offs has not been
happy. The government hopes the low price will ensure that future privatizations
achieve wider share ownership in the same way that the UK privatizations
did in the 1980s. <BR>
<BR>
The Italian treasury earlier sought to bolster demand by offering to insure
shareholders against any collapse in the Eni share price, a device that
was invented for the successful privatization of the Spanish oil company
Repsol earlier this year. If the share price declines, the government has
pledged to pay shareholders the difference between the offer price and the
trading price one year after flotation, up to a maximum of 10%. <BR>
<BR>
But despite this safety net, the 200,000 individual shareholders, including
many Eni employees, who subscribed to Eni shares fell well short of the
million that the government was hoping for. Half the 1.2 billion shares
on offer were available to Italian retail investors, but only 450 million
were taken up. &quot;Unfortunately only the most sophisticated retail buyers
can see through the uncertain market conditions and look at the company,&quot;
says one banker involved in the transaction. Another factor was that, unlike
investors in many of the British privatizations of the 1980s, investors
in Eni were asked to pay in full for their shares, not in instalments. <BR>
<BR>
The institutional tranche of 750 million shares, on the other hand, was
twice oversubscribed. Italian institutions were allocated 225 million shares,
US 200 million and UK 170 million. <BR>
<BR>
Whether the excess demand consists of genuine long-term investors remains
to be seen. As <I>Euromoney</I> went to press, the shares had barely risen
above their issue price during the first couple of days of trading. But,
with Eni shares representing 14% of the Italian stock market index, many
institutions will eventually feel obliged to own the stock even if they
didn't originally subscribe. If the price picks up as expected, the government's
generosity ought to yield long-term benefits for its privatization programme.

<H4>JAPAN-TARGETED ISSUES </H4>
<H3>Fair pricing or rip-off? </H3>
Yamaichi Securities is taking no chances on the marketing of the record
$2 billion deal it launched for Sweden last month. It has booked advertisements
in over 50 newspapers - and even on the Tokyo subway. <BR>
<BR>
No wonder. It is hoped that over 100,000 individuals will buy this record-breaking
deal. It is the largest ever single-tranche foreign-currency issue targeted
at Japanese retail. <BR>
<BR>
Justin May, who covers Sweden for Yamaichi, says: &quot;There's a lot of
money out there that's got to find a home.&quot; Yamaichi hope to provide
one. <BR>
<BR>
According to Yamaichi, which has 118 branches, December is a freak month
in Japan. Around &#165;20 trillion of investments reach maturity. In addition,
Yamaichi estimates that Japan's 50 million employees will receive bonuses
of &#165;28 trillion, of which &#165;5.6 trillion will be saved. Sweden's
three-year four-month bond carries a coupon of 4.5%. This offers a 400 basis
point (bp) pick-up over Japanese government bonds. But retail investors
usually compare rates against the three-year bank deposit rate: it stands
at 1.05%. <BR>
<BR>
But the pricing on Sweden's deal was controversial. One animated banker
says the deal amounted to &quot;ripping the eyes out of Japanese retail
investors&quot;. Euromarket participants estimate that Sweden issued at
40bp through US treasuries, and got its money (less fees) at attractive
sub-Libor levels, perhaps as low as Libor less 30bp. <BR>
<BR>
Yamaichi won't comment on the pricing or on the level of the swap, but says
it is a matter of public record that the all-in cost to Sweden was 4bp over
treasuries. It dismisses the idea that Sweden achieved Libor minus 30bp
as wildly off the mark. A banker at a rival house says, however, that since
Sweden's borrowing target was Libor less 18bp, it must have received an
attractive swap. He suspects the swap was funded out of Yamaichi's 1.2%
fee. <BR>
<BR>
Yamaichi needed to pull off something spectacular to mend fences with the
borrower. The relationship was damaged by a deal it did for Sweden in December
1993. The small &#165;50 billion transaction nearly ended in a buy-in, after
the deal was widely shorted and the lead manager, controlling all the bonds,
ini-tiated a bear-squeeze. Yamaichi counters, however, that its relationship
with Sweden was mended by a A$600 million deal ($449.7 million) it placed
with Japanese retail this September. <BR>
<BR>
The main criticisms of the latest deal is that Japanese housewives are being
sold Sweden at a yield lower than US treasuries. Wouldn't it make more sense
for them to buy treasuries than the AA+ rated Sweden? Yamaichi argues that
it is difficult for retail investors to buy treasuries in small lots. But
other Japanese houses counter that this is not true. One Japanese banker
says treasuries can be bought in &quot;bite-size&quot; quantities and, if
need be, kept in a custodial account by the securities house. However, the
commission a retail investor would pay to buy a US treasury would probably
bring the price to about the same level as the Sweden bonds. <BR>
<BR>
Nat Rubner, head of syndicate at Yamaichi, justifies the pricing by referring
to European retail placement. &quot;For all sovereign and highly-rated borrowers,
the offer price to retail investors is well through the government bond.
Why should it be any different for Japanese investors?&quot; That's true.
But such retail deals are typically small. It should be a different matter
when the issue is for $2 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Yamaichi may have more difficulty placing the deal during the three week
offering period than it makes out. Daiwa's large dollar deal for Italy in
October (a two-tranche, $1.5 billion zero-coupon, and $500 million plain-vanilla
deal) struggled, partly because it was too big. The deal had to be reopened
by filing a second securities registration statement. This is a form which
allows the bonds to be sold to more than 49 investors per day. <BR>
<BR>
Two interpretations of this action are possible. Either Daiwa was not able
to sell all the issue, or alternatively, retail investors sold the bonds
back to the lead manager to profit from currency gains they made after the
yen weakened from 100 to 104 at the beginning of November. <BR>
<BR>
Even the second interpretation raises questions about the stability of Japan-targeted
foreign currency issues. If the yen weakens and investors sell, the lead
manager is put in an odd position. Reselling the bonds is difficult. Investors
who did not buy the first time will hardly do so once the potential upside
of a currency play has been removed. <BR>
<BR>
The rush of Japanese retail deals worries non-Japanese Eurobond houses -
who are unable to match the attractive cost-of-funds available in Japan.
Even second-tier securities houses, such as Wako and New Japan, have got
in on the act, leading small deals for the World Bank and the EBRD . <BR>
<BR>
One syndicate manager estimates that, in the Euromarket, the Sweden deal
would have come at 20bp over Libor - about 40bp more expensive than in the
Japanese retail market. <BR>
<BR>
Christine Holm, head of international funding for Sweden, says 46% of the
sovereign's borrowing this year has been in yen. Bankers estimate that Sweden
has relied on Japan for 80% of its borrowing. <B>Steven Irvine<BR>

<H4>SOVEREIGN DEBT </H4>
<H3>The new sovereign advisers </H3>
The Irish National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), which manages the
republic's sovereign liabilities, has reportedly awarded UBS a mandate to
advise it on how to manage its debt. The Australian treasury gave UBS a
similar mandate in September. In both cases, UBS replaced JP Morgan as adviser.
UBS's double triumph highlights the growing importance of sovereign debt
management advisory work for investment banks. <BR>
<BR>
For some years, the trend among sovereigns has been to establish independent
debt management offices. Sweden, New Zealand, Finland and, most recently,
Greece have all done this, to a greater or a lesser degree. The creation
of an independent agency allows governments to hire top finance professionals
and pay them more than civil servants. But the performance of the debt management
team can be monitored. <BR>
<BR>
Some sovereigns are going a step further and seeking advice from external
consultants. Ireland and Australia both used JP Morgan as an official adviser.
Other sovereigns have similar informal arrangements. <BR>
<BR>
Various types of institution - not just banks - are beginning to offer advice
on debt management. The contest for the Australian mandate in September
was fought out by 20 firms including accountants and private consultants
as well as investment banks. Peter McCray, director of debt management at
the Australian treasury, believes, however, that investment banks have the
upper hand because of their greater specialist expertize. <BR>
<BR>
What's in it for the banks? Not direct profits: the adviser is not paid
a fee. But being the sole adviser to a sovereign considerably enhances the
bank's relationship with the government . <BR>
<BR>
Alex Pilato, director of debt management at HSBC Markets in London, argues
that investment banks can adopt one of two approaches to help sovereigns
manage their debt: they can set up risk management software and systems,
or just provide straight advice. But he believes that the scope for providing
systems expertize is limited: software houses are cheaper. <BR>
<BR>
Jonathan Hakim, head of European debt capital markets at Lehman Brothers
in London, puts a slightly different gloss on the approach. He argues that
software is important, although he admits that there &quot;are trickier
bits with sovereigns&quot;. He singles out the need to develop benchmarks
by which to judge performance. This is harder to do for a sovereign than
for a corporate or a bank because there is nothing tangible, such as physical
assets, to match liabilities against. Excessively inflexible benchmarking
can also be dangerous: at times offering unfeasible solutions. At that point,
market judgement by the adviser has to take over. &quot;The idea is to go
behind the scenes to tackle the non-obvious,&quot; says Robert Harding,
director at UBS in London. <BR>
<BR>
Debt managers used to concentrate purely on how to issue new debt most cost
effectively. The focus has shifted, however, to managing the whole debt
portfolio on a dynamic basis. &quot;Gone are the days when borrowers would
issue and forget about their debt until maturity,&quot; says Charles Berman,
capital markets director at Salomon Brothers in London. <BR>
<BR>
These developments are highlighted by the experience of the Australian treasury.
At the start of its contract with JP Morgan six years ago, the adviser's
role was to provide a portfolio strategy for the year ahead. In the last
year or so however, the role became more diversified. JP Morgan assisted
in constructing a long-term benchmark for the sovereign; it provided advice
on short-term tactical departures from that benchmark; and it developed
models to measure value added. <BR>
<BR>
As government budget deficits around the world decline and many sovereigns
shift from having net debt to having net assets, their skill at managing
their total portfolio will become more important. <BR>
<BR>
But why has UBS done so well at picking up advisory mandates? Harding at
UBS attributes his bank's success to its state-of-the-art technology accompanied
by good strategic advice. But McCray at the Australian treasury denies that
UBS's approach is any different from JP Morgan's. <BR>
<BR>
JP Morgan's retreat may be easier to explain. Some bankers suggest it is
connected to the departure of its debt management head, Alex Pilato, for
HSBC Markets at the end of 1994. JP Morgan declined to comment. <B>Elisa

<H3>RUSSIA</H3> 
<H2>Piling high to meet the quota </H2>
<H4>Russian privatization has been rapid and controversial. Transfers to
banks of stakes in the country's largest businesses have sparked a furious
debate about the terms of the deals and whether or not the banks are improving
management. But instead of changing tack, the government has been pushing
ahead before the political climate changes. Vindicating its quick approach
has been the much quieter and more successful sell-off of thousands of smaller
companies. Peter Lee reports </H4>
Last month, Russian president Boris Yeltsin sacked deputy prime minister
and leading reformer Anatoly Chubais. The immediate dispute was over Chubais's
rigorous approach to macroeconomic stabilization: the project to which he
and his aides have devoted themselves in recent months. But Chubais's greater
legacy to Russia is the privatization programme he masterminded, one of
the largest and most controversial anywhere in the world. Arguments over
its merits and faults will run and run. <BR>
<BR>
If volume were the only measure of success, Russia's reformers would have
a record to be proud of - they privatized 15,000 small and medium-sized
enterprises in two years from mid-1992 to mid-1994 before turning their
attention to larger companies last year. But those deals have generally
raised no money for the companies and precious little for the state. They
have simply transferred ownership from the state to a shadowy group of new
owners: old company managers, banks and Russian entrepreneurs. &quot;The
first stage of the privatization process was never intended to raise money.
It was a legal form of bribery, designed to involve everyone from company
managers to the general public,&quot; says Roger Gale, resident representative
of the IFC in Moscow. <BR>
<BR>
Whether new owners prove as adept at running companies as at acquiring them
will determine the success or failure of the whole Russian privatization
programme. The early signs are mixed. <BR>
<BR>
The process bred cynicism. In many cases, large blocks of shares were sold
to new owners through investment tenders. Rather than paying a purchase
price, they promised to invest large sums in improving the companies over
the years to come. But these new owners have been slow to deliver on their
promises, and there is no mechanism for taking companies back from owners
which renege on their agreements. <BR>
<BR>
A drawback of the privatization process was its administration by local
state committees. These took a rather Soviet-style approach. &quot;They
were mostly interested in figures, in the numbers of companies being privatized
and whether they were meeting their quotas. They did not even consider that
new owners might not make the promised investments. They just assumed the
system would work properly,&quot; says Andrey Kosogov, chairman of Alfa
Capital, a Russian investment group. &quot;Most did not realize that the
purpose of these economic reforms was to make companies perform better.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Often it is unclear who now owns even some quite large companies. &quot;That's
more than a little worrying,&quot; concedes Maxim Boycko, chief executive
officer at the Russian privatization centre. &quot;It's one of the valid
criticisms of privatization in Russia. It's unclear where the pressure will
come from to restructure these companies and make them competitive.&quot;
But he defends the process. &quot;These companies were highly politicized.
Difficult compromises had to be made in order for companies to be sold in
the mass privatization.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Wrong people</B> <BR>
<BR>
Many company managers are secretive about and protective of their newly
won shareholdings in companies where they have worked for years. That's
not surprising. One day those holdings may make them fabulously rich. But
the prominence of long-serving managers is not usually to the companies'
advantage, says Martin Andersson, president at brokerage Brunswick. &quot;In
some cases, incumbent managers are not the best people to run and own these
companies,&quot; he says. &quot;The best privatizations are those which
have enabled outsiders to come in and to force changes.&quot; Andersson
estimates that around 20% of Russian company directors have been fired or
replaced since privatization began in earnest in 1993. <BR>
<BR>
But what credentials do these outsiders boast? Many Russian entrepeneurs
began their careers trading computers in the early 1990s before moving into
raw materials and then amassing industrial assets. Some might call them
criminals. &quot;They could scarcely operate in Russia today without ignoring
certain regulations and even breaking some laws,&quot; says one foreign
banker. &quot;And they may occasionally use strong-arm tactics. But what
is important is that they will be real owners of these assets. They have
money. Now they want to change, to become respectable.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Other owners are also keeping their heads down. Russian banks own more industrial
companies than is widely recognized, a result of the country's unusual credit
situation. &quot;Credit is very tight,&quot; points out Andrew Cowley, managing
director at United City Bank. &quot;There is very little bank lending at
a time when many companies are desperate for working capital. Instead of
making six-month or 12-month loans to companies, many banks have been making
great returns in GKOs [government treasury bills]. If they like a company
enough to lend to it, many bankers think they might just as well buy the
company.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Many Russian banks are fronts for trading operations. Their growing power
suggests that these banks, or the groups behind them, may eventually control
a large part of the economy. The heads of many Russian banks are Jewish
and, in a country with a history of periodic outbursts of anti-semitism,
they may be wary of a hue and cry that they have bought up Russia's best
companies on the cheap. But they could not avoid publicity during the latest
round of large company privatizations. <BR>
<BR>
At the end of last year, the Russian privatization programme descended into
a series of dubious insider deals, with banks at the centre, as reformers
finally grappled with the country's huge natural-resource companies. Desperate
to begin the privatization before December's elections brought in a more
conservative Duma, worried by the depressed state of the Russian stock market
and still keen to raise some proceeds for the state budget, the government
resorted to the now notorious loans-for-shares technique. <BR>
<BR>
Under this system, Russian banks lend the government money and are granted
shares in large companies as security. If the loans are not repaid this
September, the banks will gain full control of the shares. They can then
sell them, returning 70% of profits to the state and retaining 30%. If the
banks <I>do</I> retain the shares after September 1996, they then have until
December 1998 to dispose of them or ownership reverts to the state. These
onward sales should be open, transparent and competitive. Meanwhile the
banks have enough power over the companies to sack managers, but not enough
to restructure them fundamentally by selling off factories and divisions,
issuing new shares or raising large loans. <BR>
<BR>
The structure of the scheme meant that foreigners were prevented from bidding
for stakes in Russia's large oil companies, which control vast reserves.
However, foreign money has played some part in the programme, for example,
through the asset-management arms of Russian brokerage firms. It is also
widely rumoured that foreign finance has stood behind several Russian bidders
in loans for shares and that the foreigners involved are waiting in the
wings to buy blocks of shares, perhaps after Russian banks sell them on
to affiliates or partners acting as intermediaries. <BR>
<BR>
No-one in Russia expects the government to repay the loans. The programme
was set up to look like an auction, with banks bidding for shares, not lending
against collateral. Nor is it expected that all Russian banks will rush
into disposals after September. Rather, observers speculate that the foundations
are being laid for a number of financial and industrial groups to emerge
in Russia. The banks may only appear to dispose of the shares, perhaps to
partners or affiliates, while still retaining their interests. If the first<B>
</B>loans-for-shares deals are any guide, the subsequent onward sales will
be anything but transparent, open and competitive. <BR>
<BR>
Russian bankers like to compare themselves with the German banks which built
portfolios of strategic investments in large industrial companies after
World War II. Officials of Uneximbank, whose strong growth and dynamic management
make it one of the few new Russian banks to impress western financiers,
often say it will become Russia's Deutsche Bank. A spokesman for Uneximbank
claims that it was the first to suggest the loans-for-shares scheme, last
April. <BR>
<BR>
In November, Uneximbank won control of 38% of the shares of Norilsk Nickel,
one of the world's largest nickel producers and a great prize in the loans-for-shares
programme. A minimum bid was set of $170 million to be lent to the government
in return for trust ownership over the shares. Uneximbank organized the
auction, which it duly won with a bid of $170.1 million. A competing bid
of $350 million from another Russian bank, Rossiisky Kredit, was disqualified
on technical grounds. Doubts were raised over whether Rossiisky Kredit had
sufficient cash to make the bid. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Power game</B> <BR>
<BR>
Even more doubts were raised about the whole process. &quot;It was a total
inside job,&quot; says one western investment banker in Moscow. &quot;Bids
had to be presented at Norilsk Nickel and the company even threatened to
close the factory gates if a rival investor group showed up. That really
turns people off.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Although Uneximbank technically holds these shares for nine months as a
guarantee for its loan to the government, bank officials and company management
met in December to thrash out a three-year strategic business and investment
plan. Uneximbank hopes to bring up to $1 billion of Russian and foreign
investment into the company. <BR>
<BR>
Norilsk Nickel was the subject of the second loans-for-shares deal. The
first, for 40% of Surgutneftegas, Russia's third-largest oil company, was
equally dubious. The winner of the stake was the company's own pension fund.
&quot;Surgutneftegas now seems to be owned indirectly by management and
this creates a problem,&quot; says Boycko. Russian privatization is often
described as a raw game of power. Power over Surgutneftegas now appears
to rest in the hands of its senior manager, Vladimir Bogdanov who, unlike
many Russian oil barons, is rarely seen in Moscow, preferring to remain
in far-off Surgut running a successful oil company. No-one knows for sure
how profitable it is and Bogdanov has offered no encouragement to outside
investors until now. But one of his first acts after consolidating control
was to sound out the Bank of New York about the possibility of setting up
an ADR programme. Maybe he is thinking of pushing up the share price and
realizing some of his paper wealth. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Bidding challenge</B> <BR>
<BR>
More controversy followed when, to no-one's surprise, Bank Menatep won a
combined loans-for-shares and investment-tender bid for 78% of the shares
in Yukos, the country's second-largest oil company, in an auction which
Menatep organized itself. Yukos management supported Menatep's bid which
was publicly denounced by other Russian banks including Rossiisky Kredit,
Inkombank and Alfa Bank. <BR>
<BR>
To be valid, a loans-for-shares auction required at least two bidders. Finding
a rival bidder so that this requirement could be fulfilled often became
a tough challenge for a major participant. To qualify, bidders had to deposit
the entire bid amount, free of interest, with the finance ministry one month
before the auction. This often ran to many millions of dollars - $500 million
in the case of Yukos. That meant withdrawing money from the high-yielding
GKO market, which has provided 100% dollar returns. Few banks cared to forgo
such rewards to take part in auctions that were almost certainly going to
be rigged. Likely winning bidders sometimes had to prompt their own affiliate
companies to bid in order to give an appearance of true competition. <BR>
<BR>
Few foreign investment bankers have a kind word to say about the conduct
of the loans-for-shares programme. But controversies over individual auctions
are already fading. Now potential investors are more interested in how the
banks will influence and manage the companies that have fallen under their
control. There are plenty of sceptics. &quot;Unexim and Menatep managers
are busy running their banks, never mind being venture capitalists - changing
company managers, finding new markets and so on,&quot; says Stephen Marquardt,
director at Merrill Lynch. Yet he does see some role for the banks. &quot;Maybe
they can act as in-house financial advisers for these companies, which need
so much money.&quot; A Russian sovereign Eurobond is likely in the first
half of this year. Some of the larger Russian companies, arguably better
credit risks than the state itself, might follow. <BR>
<BR>
Another opportunity for the banks will be to take any cash in hand at the
companies and invest it, for example, in the high-yielding GKO market. Banks
have become eager for any outside source of funds since the near-collapse
of the interbank funding market last year. If they can redirect companies'
cashflows through their own accounts this will leave them less dependent
on the interbank market. Even just acting as sole third-party suppliers
of banking services to very large companies should net them some profits.
&quot;They love this idea of being compared to Deutsche Bank,&quot; says
one foreign banker, &quot;but really they haven't the first idea about managing
oil companies.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
One positive thing about the loans-for-shares scheme, say foreign bankers,
is that it sends a buy signal for Russia. Domestic investors are buying
assets with real money. &quot;Loans for shares has been a rather obscure
scheme,&quot; says Brunswick's Andersson, &quot;but I don't see how the
banks can be worse owners than the government. Their interest should be
enhancing the value of these companies, not stealing from them. Even though
the process has been somewhat strange, we may look back in two years and
judge it a good way to get these assets out of government control.&quot;
He adds: &quot;Many of the people who amassed assets in 1993 to 1995 are
now restructuring them, developing new functions, like marketing, distribution
and finance.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A similar revolution can be detected at some state-owned and part-privatized
Russian companies. Under the old Soviet system, it never hurt a company
general manager's prospects to appear ambitious in front of a central planner
from Moscow, requesting extravagant investment to expand production. Now
managers are realizing that finance is scarce, and the best of them are
absorbing western financial concepts such as return on equity. Even the
mighty Gazprom, potentially the world's largest company, controlling one-third
of the planet's gas reserves, has reined in some of its more ambitious projects.
Plans to drill and lay pipelines under the Arctic permafrost of the Yamal
peninsula have been scaled back. Current gas prices make the project uneconomic.
&quot;Managers now talk about margins, rates of return and profits, and
are less interested in expansion for its own sake,&quot; says Philip Lambert,
director at Kleinwort Benson, which is working on a possible sale of up
to 9% of Gazprom's share capital. This will probably start with a convertible
bond sold to a handful of strategic investors. <BR>
<BR>
The biggest risk for western gas companies is the uncertainty of exploring
for and securing gas reserves but Gazprom already has reserves equivalent
to 70 years' production. Gazprom's management has therefore become more
focused on pressing details, such as problems of supply and late payment.
In the Ukraine, the company has taken assets to compensate for late payment.
The quest to make its domestic market pay has even led the company to take
over some customers and suppliers. &quot;They are adapting their thinking
to cope with the extraordinary situation they are in. Westerners often criticize
Russian managers in a patronizing way. They should remember that these managers
aren't working in the west,&quot; says one banker. <BR>
<BR>
Gazprom is essentially the old Russian gas ministry. It supplies half the
country's primary energy and almost a third of Europe's gas. It has a recognizable
strategy of striving to be an international company, not just a supplier,
with a large presence in Germany and Finland as well as stakes in consortia
building pipelines across Europe. It is by some estimates 10 or 15 times
larger than Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company. <BR>
<BR>
Recognizing Gazprom's unique position, the Russian government has taken
much more care over its partial privatization than those of other companies.
It has appointed western advisers and accountants. At any one time, more
than 50 Price Waterhouse accountants have been sifting through the company's
records and financial statements. They have already produced two preliminary
financial reports. Later this year they will produce an international accounting
standard audit of the company's balance sheet and Gazprom will use this
as a basis for reporting its P&amp;L. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Big deal</B> <BR>
<BR>
Kleinwort Benson has suggested a convertible bond, perhaps converting into
straight equity two or three years after launch, partly because political
uncertainty has dragged Russian stock market valuations unacceptably low.
The firm is targeting investors which have already decided that they can
live with Russian country risk and that already deal with Gazprom. The sale
of 9% of the company may then proceed through two or more tranches. <BR>
<BR>
It would be reassuring for the Russian government and for prospective foreign
investors if one large conventional privatization could be completed with
a sale of a large stake in a leading Russian company either to a single
strategic investor or to portfolio investors. Svyazinvest, a holding company
owning stakes in 85 regional Russian phone companies and licences to operate
in long-distance and international markets, was supposed to be that deal.
In December, Italy's Stet was ready to pay up to $1.4 billion for a 25%
stake in Svyazinvest, which the Russian authorities marketed as a potential
competitor to the better-known Rostelekom. But the deal fell apart at the
end of last year (see page 20) when Stet asked for more formal guarantees
over a list of legal and regulatory conditions before committing to a hefty
purchase price and substantial programme of investment. <BR>
<BR>
Stet was probably right to be cautious. Svyazinvest is an odd creature.
The joke among foreign bankers in Moscow is that it is the only telephone
company that does not have a fax machine. A handful of employees oversee
its stakes in 85 regional phone companies, which include the Petersburg
Telephone Network and Moscow International and Inter-city Operator. &quot;It
is at best a virtual company,&quot; sniffs one investment banker who prefers
Rostelekom, itself being guided towards the international capital markets
by Merrill Lynch. Had the Svyazinvest deal worked, it would have been a
feather in the cap of Chubais, Boycko and the other Russian champions of
privatization. And it would have proved that conventional case-by-case privatization
of companies, developing an investment story for each, as opposed to mass
privatization, could work in Russia. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mixed bag</B> <BR>
<BR>
The collapse of the Svyazinvest deal is a serious setback. But it would
be wrong to think that privatization in Russia halted after the mass sale
of businesses in 1994 and only started again at the end of 1995 with the
troubled loans-for-shares scheme and big projects such as Svyazinvest. Ordinary
auctions have proceeded across Russia, both sealed-bid cash tenders and
investment tenders. Bidders have come from existing local business and financial
groups. This process has thrown out a mixed bag of well-run and poorly-run
regional companies in many sectors including pulp and paper, shipping and
ports, cement and food. Some, such as fertilizer companies, generate substantial
hard-currency earnings and are tremendously undervalued. <BR>
<BR>
Victor Huaco, president of trading com-pany<B> </B>AIOC Capital, says: &quot;Attractive
small companies are being acquired all the time through the privatization
process. Generally, these aren't shown to the market. If a broker finds
one, it will try to keep some equity for itself and place the remainder
with one or two favoured clients.&quot; It may be that these small-to-medium
companies, not the more widely covered oil and gas and metal company giants,
will be the key to the future for Russian industry. &quot;Some of the medium-sized
companies, not the blue chips, seem to have been most successful,&quot;
says Boycko. &quot;I am a bit sceptical about the bigger companies' ability
to change quickly.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Alfa Capital is one Russian investment company that has specialized in amassing
stakes in small-to-medium companies. During the first voucher auctions it
aimed to acquire at least 29% of companies selected according to four rough
and ready criteria: that the company should produce something for which
there would be great demand in the immediate future, such as food, industrial
and construction materials, or pharmaceuticals; that it should have some
of the modern equipment installed at many Russian companies during the Gorbachev
era; that it should not operate in regions of great political tension; that
foreign investors should also be interested. <BR>
<BR>
Alfa Capital built a portfolio of companies concentrated in specific sectors:
cement, glass, soap, cooking fat, crackers, tea. Where managers were weak,
it strove to replace them, often deploying new managers from Moscow to the
regions. That sometimes incurred the displeasure of local authorities. &quot;We
settled things with the local authorities, so that our regional businesses
were not boycotted,&quot; says Kosogov, without explaining how generous
these settlements were. It also had to deal with criminal gangs, sometimes
through use of force. &quot;But these problems were as nothing to our economic
problems. The biggest problem of all was the high net cost of our products
and the fact that most managers did not know how to make costs lower, or
even understand the purpose of doing so.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At some companies it changed the management entirely, at others it did away
with unprofitable products. It reorganized. It drew its cement holdings
into one company, Alfa Cement, attracting Switzerland's Holderbank as one
of three equal shareholders. It now intends to finance the company with
loans from abroad. But Alfa Capital will be holding on to its remaining
equity investment. &quot;The potential price of Alfa Cement is much higher
now than when we started. In a few years, it might be 10 times higher still,&quot;
says Kosogov. <BR>
<BR>
To date, the dominant theme of Russian privatization has been the distribution
of ownership. Business restructuring and the evolution of corporate governance
will become increasingly important this year. The goal for Russian and foreign
investors is the tremendous return that Kosogov foresees for Alfa Cement.
That prospect should console them and the Russian economic reformers through
the controversies and the Svyazinvest-style setbacks. In the words of IFC's
Roger Gale: &quot;There's no such thing as a bad privatization, only a slow
one.&quot;

<H2>New CSFB bids to join global super-league </H2>
<H3>Swiss regain control in Credit Suisse reshuffle 
</H3>
<h4>A new global institutional and investment banking powerhouse came into
force this week as CS Holding unveiled a sweeping reorganisation of its
corporate structure.</h4>


As part of the revamp into four distinct units, the restructuring involves
the merger of the institutional banking business of Credit Suisse with the
group's investment bank, CS First Boston, to form Credit Suisse First Boston.
<BR>
<BR>
The reorganisation mirrors the structure that has already been put in place
by its main Swiss competitors, UBS and SBC Warburg, as well as continental
European heavyweights like Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. <BR>
<BR>
By creating a well-capitalised institutional and investment banking entity,
the Swiss group has signalled its determination to secure a place in the
fast-emerging super-league of global investment banks. <BR>
<BR>
The reorganisation has also moved control of the investment banking operation
away from New York. From now on the bias will shift to London and Zurich,
while two key executives from the Swiss holding company -- Hans-Ulrich Doerig
and Oswald Grubel -- have been put in senior management positions. <BR>
<BR>
Doerig, who was chief executive of the former Credit Suisse First Boston
in London in its 1980s heydays, becomes chief executive officer of the new
Credit Suisse First Boston. <BR>
<BR>
Allen Wheat, president and chief operating officer of CS First Boston, retains
his posts in the reshuffle. But Grubel, the former London trading chief
of CSFB in the 1980s, takes the powerful post of head of global sales and
trading. <BR>
<BR>
The new Credit Suisse First Boston will also house Credit Suisse Financial
Products (CSFP), the group's highly profitable derivatives subsidiary in
which Credit Suisse and CS First Boston previously held 40% shares. <BR>
<BR>
Minority shareholder Swiss Re will continue to hold a 20% share, but the
derivatives unit will become integrated within the investment bank and its
chief executive, Chris Goejkian, will become head of derivatives at Credit
Suisse First Boston. <BR>
<BR>
Goejkian will also sit on the executive committee of Credit Suisse First
Boston, along with Doerig, Wheat, Grubel and Charles Ward, the firm's head
of investment banking. <BR>
<BR>
The creation of the new institutional and investment bank is just one of
four new business units unveiled under the CS Holding revamp, which will
see the holding company's name change to Credit Suisse Group. <BR>
<BR>
The others are Credit Suisse Volksbank (which will be responsible for Swiss
domestic banking), Credit Suisse Private Banking (private banking worldwide)
and Credit Suisse Asset Management (institutional asset management worldwide).
<BR>
<BR>
But it is the creation of Credit Suisse First Boston -- a potentially much
more formidable entity than either Credit Suisse or CS First Boston on its
own -- that has caught the eye of the international financial community.
<BR>
<BR>
At a stroke the Credit Suisse Group now has an operation with equity capital
of $8.5bn, the potential to earn $1bn a year and the ability to compete
with the largest US, European and Asian contenders in the race to develop
global investment banking pre-eminence. <BR>
<BR>
Although one of the few international investment banks to enjoy bulge-bracket
status in the US, a strong European base and a well developed Asia-Pacific
business, CS First Boston's lack of size has hampered its competitive position
in recent years as other universal banking groups in Europe have emerged
as increasingly formidable forces. <BR>
<BR>
In particular, CS First Boston has been caught up and overtaken by the two
Swiss rivals that it previously dominated -- in particular SBC, whose merger
of its institutional and investment banking business was the forerunner
of its takeovers of O'Connor and SG Warburg, and was the platform for the
bank's powerful drive into international investment banking. <BR>
<BR>
Under the new structure, Credit Suisse First Boston emerges as an altogether
more potent force. Sources estimate that the component parts of the new
institutional and investment bank would have made $1.2bn last year. On its
own CS First Boston made just $200m-$300m. <BR>
<BR>
Although such a far-reaching reorganisation is bound to create friction
and an element of turmoil, the firm's senior staff are in no doubt that
it transforms the bank's competitive position. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;For all the problems there will be, and I'm sure there will be some,
this will put us in the big league where we belong,&quot; said one insider.
&quot;We have the bulge bracket status in the US, which no other European
bank has. And we are a European bank, which no American investment bank
is.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He added: &quot;We have always had everything in place to be the number
one firm. We just haven't gone about it in the right way until now.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Although applauding the reorganisation as a strategic move, rival bankers
said the management task of seeing through such a far-reaching revamp would
be arduous, while staff morale could be undermined by uncertainty over their
own future positions. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;An upheaval like this places a huge premium on management and
leadership,&quot;
said one London-based investment banker. &quot;It is a tremendous challenge
to get such a large number of people to understand and accept what is happening
and it is potentially a huge distraction at a time when there is so much
business to be done.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He added: &quot;It's something that you would rather have behind you than
in front of you.&quot;

<H3>MARKET MONITOR </H3>
<B> Edited by Peter Lee</B><BR>
<H4>UNITED STATES </H4>
<H2>In the interest of national security </H2>
Mention the fat fees to be earned from privatization and the last place
most investment bankers would think to go hunting for them is the US. But
there is a privatization programme under way in the US, and 1996 is likely
to witness the first sell-off since the Philadelphia-based Consolidated
Rail Corp (Conrail) was returned to the private sector in the early 1980s.
<BR>
<BR>
It's an unusual transaction. On the block is United States Enrichment Corp
(USEC), a government-owned entity which currently has an 88% share of the
domestic uranium-enrichment business and a 40% share worldwide. Its line
of business, together with its role as a buyer of uranium from decommissioned
nuclear warheads in Russia, make the USEC deal subject to special considerations.
<BR>
<BR>
Legislation sets out four statutory requirements for the sale. In addition
to maximizing the benefit to the US taxpayer, the stated objectives are
to ensure a continuing source of domestic uranium-enrichment services; to
create a viable private corporation without any need for future government
support; and to &quot;support the nation's national security objectives&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
This last point is linked to USEC's role in implementing the swords into
ploughshares contract that the US signed with Russia in the wake of the
end of the Cold War. The break-up of the old Soviet Union left thousands
of nuclear warheads lying around the region and, in the interests of stability,
the US was anxious not to have new nuclear powers emerge from the old Soviet
republics. It was also worried about the prospect of bomb-grade fuel being
trafficked by Russian organized-crime syndicates. <BR>
<BR>
Financial incentives have been provided by the US in order to help the decommissioning
process, and USEC plays a critical role as a buyer of low-enriched uranium
from Russia that has been blended down from the highly-enriched uranium
contained in nuclear warheads. USEC can sell this uranium to utilities as
fuel for nuclear power plants. <BR>
<BR>
As a privatization plan submitted to Congress notes: &quot;It is vital to
world security that this material be purchased.&quot; Not surprisingly,
with such issues at stake, the implementation of the privatization is being
closely monitored in Washington, and investment bankers working on the deal
have had to testify before congressional committees as part of the process.
<BR>
<BR>
The advisory mandate was won by JP Morgan which, in 1994, saw off fierce
competition from Wall Street to win the initial valuation mandate. This
helped pave the way for Morgan to win the key position of financial adviser
to USEC (there being no adviser to the government as such). &quot;We're
following a dual-track plan,&quot; explains Jim Derryberry, co-head of the
natural resources and power group at JP Morgan. &quot;There's a need to
pursue the strategic buyer market as well as a possible initial public offering.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Appearing before a congressional committee in June last year, Derryberry
estimated that an IPO could yield gross proceeds of between $1.5 billion
and $1.8 billion. The US government wants to sell 100% and does not wish
to be left with a minority stake. <BR>
<BR>
As adviser to USEC, Morgan had a non-voting role on the committee to select
the transaction manager which will close the actual sale. Morgan Stanley
won this position and will do both the M&amp;A work, in the event of a strategic
sale, or act as lead underwriter, in the event of an IPO. Merrill Lynch
was also selected as a senior lead manager in the case of an IPO, together
with an underwriting syndicate which includes names such as Salomon, Lehman
and Dean Witter. <BR>
<BR>
In the run-up to the sale, Morgan has been involved in giving advice on
how to restructure USEC in order to prepare it for its entry into the private
sector, although USEC is far from a public-sector white elephant; it has
been a reasonably efficient and profitable operator. &quot;It was run as
a government entity; it was not run to optimize profitability although it
has always been quite profitable,&quot; Derryberry notes, adding that &quot;they
needed to change the culture in order to operate in the private sector&quot;.
This has meant some management changes, cost-cutting and internal restructurings.
USEC is now judged to be ready to take flight as a private company. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately the sale process is being held up by the budget impasse in
Washington and it could be three or four months after budget legislation
is finally passed before USEC is sold. This will take the transaction deep
into an election year. There is, however, bipartisan support for the deal
from politicians on all sides to reduce the vast US national debt. <B>Michael

<H4>JAPAN </H4>
<H2>The telecoms dilemma </H2>
Japanese privatization is like a convalescent whose presence is urgently
sought for important business. After a long confinement following bouts
of high fever, the prospects of recovery are tantalizing, but the patient's
prognosis is still uncertain. <BR>
<BR>
The dire condition of the Tokyo stock market since the 1990 bursting of
the bubble and a string of horrendous IPO flops - JR East in 1993, Japan
Telecom and Japan Tobacco in 1994 - have resulted in a huge backlog of pending
privatization sales. <BR>
<BR>
Two-thirds of Japan's biggest company, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT),
remains in government hands after five planned sales of 500,000 shares per
year from fiscal 1991-92 to 1995-96 were all dropped by the ministry of
finance (MoF). Previous NTT sales had become notorious symbols of the stock-price
casino and did not endear the MoF to stung Japanese punters: in 1986 NTT
shares were first offered for sale at &#165;1.2 million ($11,400) each,
and the following year reached &#165;3.18 million, but now trade for around
&#165;800,000. <BR>
<BR>
Now at last a new sale of 500,000 NTT shares, using a book-building system
to set the price instead of an auction, as before, is expected in the next
fiscal year beginning April 1. The MoF is dangling the carrot of a substantial
international tranche, of between 20% and 40% of the issue, and all the
main foreign investment banks in Tokyo have begun parading before the two
bureaucrats - Akio Nakamura and Takuji Tanaka - in charge at the MoF's national
assets section of its finance bureau. <BR>
<BR>
European houses are making much mileage out of Japanese bureaucrats' conversion
to book-building for future NTT and Japan Tobacco offerings. This is understood
to remove much of the pricing volatility - which is largely a result of
the considerable time gap between the price being set at auction and actual
listing on the market - that has scarred past privatizations in Japan. The
foreign firms' avowed goal in this is to become global coordinator, or at
least European lead manager, for the secondary Japan Tobacco and NTT offerings.
<BR>
<BR>
Whatever structure is used, the sale may be a tough one. The Japanese telecom
market is vastly more dynamic and sophisticated than when NTT's privatization
was first mooted: 12 years ago NTT had a domestic monopoly, whereas now
there are over 100 telecoms companies in Japan. The government has yet to
decide whether to break up NTT. <BR>
<BR>
NTT's 5.4 million listed shares, worth &#165;4.4 trillion ($42 billion),
already comprise 1.2% of market capitalization of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
First Section. &quot;You've got to have exposure to NTT,&quot; pitches George
Olcott, executive director of SBC Warburg's equity capital market group.
Masako Egawa, executive director of corporate finance, adds that the chances
of a break-up of NTT have become &quot;very slim, politically&quot;. In
the past, the firm (along with Goldman Sachs and Kleinwort Benson) recommended
NTT as a &quot;buy&quot; on the basis of a likely break-up. <BR>
<BR>
Securities houses are sitting on both sides of the fence. Some privately
recommend a break-up. Others want to cosy up to NTT in the hope of winning
more business from the company in its present form. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The issue is highly political, and it also depends on whether MoF
believes the Japanese stock market can absorb this kind of billion dollar
offering,&quot; explains a source at Morgan Stanley Japan. &quot;The government
needs money, but MoF's first priority is to protect the stock market. It's
a complicated situation,&quot; agrees Andrew Boyle of Schroder Securities
(Japan). <BR>
<BR>
The same dilemma faces the government before giving the green light to four
more bumper-to-bumper privatizations: some 270,000 shares of Japan Tobacco
that were left unsold in the initial public offering (IPO) of October 1994;
IPOs of two regional companies of the Japanese Railways Group, JR West and
JR Tokai, that were thrown off track last year when the Kobe earthquake
devastated their balance sheets; and lastly, the sale of the remaining 1.5
million shares held by the government in JR East. <BR>
<BR>
Tobacco and railways are not foreign favourites but, given the political
sensitivity of NTT at the moment, it seems likely these issues will come
to the market first. Government budgetary blues are likely to speed the
listing of JR West and JR Tokai. <BR>
<BR>
As of April last year, the Japan National Railways Settlement Corp (JNRSC)
was holding &#165;26.9 trillion in debt left behind after the old state-run
JNR was split into seven private companies in 1987. <BR>
The more disposals it can effect, through sale of its land and stock in
the new companies, the smaller will be the eventual bill for the Japanese
taxpayer. However, the slump in urban land prices has considerably delayed
JNRSC's debt repayment schedule: 40% of its land remains unsold, adding
to the pressure for the JR West listing of 2 million shares and the JR Tokai
listing of 2.24 million shares to proceed as quickly as possible. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, the two privatization front-runners are IPOs, for which Japan's
mandarins have yet to accept the merits of an international tranche. Interestingly
the Japanese government's sudden zeal for book-building does not embrace
IPOs - JR West, for instance, will only use a combination of tender and
public offer. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The underlying problem is that the MoF doesn't trust Japanese security
firms. The MoF believes they would sell it pretty cheap to please its investors.
An auction would at least be 'God's voice',&quot; says a source at Morgan
Stanley. &quot;The government is extremely conservative about disposing
of national assets, so they don't trust security houses for their IPOs.
Once the stock is on the market, it's a different matter,&quot; adds Shimpei
Kasama of Kleinwort Benson's corporate finance team in Tokyo. <B>Peter McGill</B>

<BR>

<H4>CONVERTIBLES </H4>
<H2>Not convertible to Maastricht </H2>
Privatization experts say it will be the year of the convertible. &quot;Clearly
last year a number of privatizations ran into some problems,&quot; says
Jerker Johansson, a managing director at Morgan Stanley. &quot;I think issuers
will look at convertible bonds as a viable alternative.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
His optimism is shared by Farley Bolwell, responsible for Merrill Lynch's
European equity-linked origination. &quot;In the first month of this year
there has been much greater awareness of the convertible product among government
issuers than last year,&quot; he says. A lack of supply means aggressive
terms are on offer. &quot;This market is on fire,&quot; says one banker.
&quot;Doing these things is a no brainer,&quot; says another. Demand will
be further fuelled by up to 20% of international investors' holdings of
convertible bonds being redeemed/converted this year. <BR>
<BR>
Privatization convertibles are not a new product. Broadly, there are two
types. The first is a &quot;mandatory exchangeable&quot; which automatically
gets exchanged into shares after a fixed period of time and has no risk
of non-conversion. This is simply an equity play. The Balladur bonds issued
in 1991 - which gave investors the preferential right to participate in
French privatizations - were a crude extension of the idea. The issue for
Swedish Steel in 1992, which carried a zero coupon but came with a warrant
entitling the holder to exchange bonds into equity, was another innovative
variation on the theme. Clearly nobody had any motivation to buy these bonds
unless conversion was their goal. <BR>
<BR>
The second is a plain vanilla convertible. It behaves like a bond but can
be converted into equity once the underlying shares reach a pre-arranged
price. The difference is that, for whatever reason, bondholders may decide
not to convert their holdings to equity. The advantage to the investor is
the limited downside. The bond component ensures that a coupon is received
(below market rates). So even if the investor does not convert - maybe because
the share price has crashed - there is a floor of absolute value, based
on the bond's yield to redemption. But the upside is theoretically limitless,
depending on the strike price at which the investor can convert to equity
- known as the premium - and how well the shares perform over the course
of the bond. <BR>
<BR>
So will government issuers be scrambling to take advantage of the sort of
demand in the convertible market that had $11 billion chasing the biggest
con-vertible ever, the $2 billion deal for Mitsubishi Bank last year? <BR>
<BR>
One already is - the Republic of Italy. It has announced its intention to
sell the second tranche of Italian insurance company INA, as a convertible
bond. At L3 trillion ($1.9 billion), it will be the largest ever convertible
in Europe. But at the time of going to press, the deal - mandated to Goldman
Sachs and IMI - was stalled by the Italian political crisis. The window
of 70 days from January 1 in which the deal could go ahead is rapidly diminishing.
After 70 days a new government must be formed or elections called, and Goldman
Sachs says the deal can only go ahead with political approval. <BR>
<BR>
Dante Roscini, executive director in equity capital markets at Goldman,
thinks INA could be the tonic the market needs: &quot;Once there's a major
successful issue, it will open the market and others will follow.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The convertible instrument will have two major advantages for Italy. First,
it can be done quickly - literally in a morning and without the need for
a worldwide roadshow or the fanfare of an international equity offering.
Second, it taps a different investor base - a major consideration with the
deal so close to the giant IPO of Italian state oil company ENI in December.
For example, if bond funds in Germany and Switzerland take part, this creates
a favourable price tension with traditional equity buyers. <BR>
<BR>
But the Italian deal raises another problem which bankers, in their enthusiasm
for the product, may have overlooked: the Maastricht Treaty's convergence
criteria on debt. Nobody seemed to have told the Italians that a convertible
doesn't reduce debt in the eyes of Maastricht - at least not until it is
converted into equity at some point in the future. <BR>
<BR>
A senior official at the European Monetary Institute (EMI), billed by a
colleague as &quot;an absolute specialist on this very specific question&quot;,
pronounced: &quot;As a rule of principle, convertibles are part of gross
debt and the Maastricht criterion looks at gross debt.&quot; He adds: &quot;I
am not aware of any exceptions.&quot; If anyone is in doubt they can consult
the European system of integrated accounts (ESA), heading F50, which states
that convertibles are classified as debt - not equity - until the day they
are converted. <BR>
<BR>
All of which means the act of issuing a convertible actually increases government
debt as opposed to reducing it. If pro-ceeds are immediately used to pay
down other debt, the effect will be neutral. But this is a little hard for
European governments to swallow. Many are privatizing, not out of any ideological
zeal but purely for budgetary purposes. So the convertible market may look
good - but unfortunately not where the budget is concerned. <BR>
<BR>
Mario Draghi (see profile page 56), director general of the Italian treasury,
points out that this is the first year in 15 years in which Italian gross
debt will decline. He explains: &quot;Everything is geared towards Maastricht.
We want to meet the Maastricht criteria.&quot; The Maastricht criterion
on gross debt says it must be no more than 60% of GDP. <BR>
<BR>
He does not dispute the EMI's verdict on convertibles. Which raises the
question, why use one? &quot;You have to be pragmatic,&quot; he says. &quot;You
have to find the best instrument from the market viewpoint. We are listening
to what the market tells us.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Italy is budgeted to do L10 trillion of privatization in 1996. But one rumour
says it will attempt to go for L13 trillion instead. The reason being that
it cannot use the L3 trillion INA convertible in its Maastricht calculations.
<BR>
<BR>
The reaction of bankers to this potential problem has been varied. At one
extreme are those who haven't given the matter much thought. The worst case
is the US banker who claimed confidently that it was not a problem because
&quot;all the debt is just netted out&quot; - perhaps in an ideal world
but not where Maastricht statisticians are concerned. At the other is the
pragmatic view that you can tweak the convertible so that it converts before
the Maastricht criterion is judged. But this does not give you much time
since it is the 1997 accounts which will matter. Usually convertibles don't
convert for two to three years because they otherwise destabilize the underlying
share price through arbitrage. <BR>
<BR>
But forgetting the Maastricht issue, Johansson at Morgan Stanley, while
bullish, says the difficulty of promoting convertibles as privatization
instruments goes deeper: &quot;The one argument that a government does bring
up, which I fully understand, is that if they take the sometimes politically
painful decision to privatize an asset, then they want to be sure they've
sold it. The problem with doing an exchangeable is they're not sure they
have.&quot; The bondholders may decide they don't want the equity. Or the
strike price is never reached because the underlying shares don't perform.
Here, the government must redeem the full amount at maturity. A treasury
official can only tell the prime minister that the country has had several
years of cheap finance (convertible coupons being lower than the sovereign's
standard bonds). <BR>
<BR>
Less clear then is the bankers' continued optimism that 1996 will be the
year of convertibles, at least where European governments are concerned.
It suggests the Maastricht question is not occupying much of their time
- perhaps because they are sceptical of the timetable and of anyone meeting
the convergence criteria anyway. In the case of Italy, where the republic's
debt is twice the Maastricht limit, the importance of privatizations such
as INA is more to score points for showing willing. <B>Steven Irvine</B>

<BR>
EASTERN GERMANY </H4>
<H2>Hardly a model </H2>
Five and a half years after Germany began the most concerted privatization
in history there's still an argument about whether the process went too
far, too fast. <BR>
<BR>
A number of industries that passed out of state hands have come back to
haunt the seller, now called the BvS (Bundes-anstalt f&uuml;r vereinigungsbedingte
Sonderaufgaben), chief successor of the privatization agency the Treuhandanstalt
(Treuhand). Bremer Vulkan, west German buyer of three shipyards in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern,
is itself in difficulty, and the European Commission is investigating suspicions
that part of a Dm700 million subsidy for the shipyards was siphoned off
to bail out the parent. Sket, a heavy engineering manufacturer bought by
two west German entrepreneurs, is gobbling up a Dm200 million subsidy just
to keep alive, while its order-book has dried up. Since the contract was
never finalized the state is still officially the owner. <BR>
<BR>
Last year, for the first time, the banks allowed a large east German company
- construction firm Erste Baugesellschaft Leipzig - to go bust. The privatized
hotel industry is also in trouble because of depressed occupancy and competition
from newer, better hotels. Creditor banks have become majority owners of
the Interhotel Group after capitalizing the bad debts of the two west German
buyers. <BR>
<BR>
Does this mean that the Treuhand didn't always do its homework when selling
to ambitious west German entrepreneurs? Most literature about the Treuhand
praises its speed and efficiency in restructuring a bankrupt economy under
the slogan &quot;privatize quickly, restructure decisively, if there's no
other solution, shut down sensitively&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The Treuhand congratulated itself on its achievement when at the end of
1994 it handed over to its successor the BvS - itself destined to close
down in 1998. The Treuhand had privatized 6,321 large companies, secured
commitments to employ 1.5 million people and undertakings to invest a total
of Dm211 billion. This exercise cost Dm116 billion for the restructuring
of companies and Dm33.5 billion for servicing and guaranteeing their debts.
The actual proceeds were Dm37 billion against the book value of these assets,
estimated at Dm50 billion. Of around 3,000 management buy-ins or buy-outs,
more than 45% have been running successfully for three years now and 43%
for two years, with 8% of them going to the wall. Non-German direct investment
accounts for only about a tenth of the privatizations, bringing Dm6.8 billion
in payments, with Dm19 billion committed for further investment. <BR>
<BR>
The legacy of the Treuhand, apart from a bill to the German people of around
Dm163 billion, was a rump of unprivatized companies, farmland and property.
Some of the companies had been bundled into four management partnerships
(Management-Kommandit-Gesellschaften - MKGs) in 1992. At the end of 1994,
ownership of the MKGs, which consist of 49 companies and employ 14,000 people,
was transferred from the Treuhand to the newly established Beteiligungs-Management-Gesellschaft
Berlin (BMGB). During 1995 the MKGs sold off 12 companies and 7 divisions
of companies. BMGB also presides over three so-called run-off companies
- GVV which handles redundant mines, LMBV which is phasing out open-cast
lignite mines and EWN charged with decommissioning the nuclear power stations
at Rheinsberg and Greifswald. <BR>
<BR>
The job of the BvS, on the other hand, has been to take over the unfinished
business of the Treuhand, including negotiation and renegotiation of purchase
agreements, mostly involving commitments to invest capital or safeguard
jobs. In 1995 the BvS concluded the sale of the Buna Sow Leuna Olefin complex
to Dow Chemical but with a Dm9.5 billion subsidy from the German government.
The BvS also sold rolling-stock builder Deutsche Waggonbau to US fund manager
Advent International for around Dm250 million. During the year it collected
around Dm3.2 billion in payments due on privatizations, leaving about Dm4.9
billion outstanding. But perhaps its biggest task was auditing the terms
and conditions on 6,000 contracts, of which around 4,500 were successfully
confirmed. In a statement in December, BvS president Heinrich Hornef congratulated
his agency for ensuring that actual employment and investment levels exceeded
guaranteed minimums by 16% and that renegotiations affected the employment
projections by less than 1%. This alarms some analysts who say that the
BvS is too soft on preserving jobs, to the detriment of commercial realities.
<BR>
<BR>
The wrangling over terms and conditions goes on, in a worsening economic
climate. The privatization balance sheet contrasts sharply with the estimate
by Treuhand's first chairman, the late Detlev Rohwedder, back in 1990 that
east German enter-prises had a realizable net asset value of Dm600 billion.
The value in retrospect appears to have been a minus figure of around Dm250
billion, including old debts, restructuring of companies and environmental
costs. The German taxpayer is expected to continue to pay for this well
into the next century by means of the extra &quot;solidarity tax&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
There are also continuing recriminations about how the unification of Germany,
and the privatizations, were costed and carried out. One controversial area
is the opening Deutschmark balance sheets of east German enterprises and
the status of their debt, which was converted into Deutschmarks at a ratio
of Dm1 to two Ostmarks. Many of these credits on the balance sheets of east
German banks were sold along with the banks to west German institutions.
The west German banks took over management of the credits, but the default
risk was protected by government-financed compensatory claims called <I>Ausgleichsforderungen</I>.
Some opposition members of parliament have claimed that these assets were
a risk-free gift for the banks, costing the nation an unnecessary Dm25 billion.
<BR>
<BR>
On balance, the privatization of east Germany is not a model for privatizations
of other former communist countries. The safety net offered by an indulgent
parent may ultimately have been counterproductive, driving up wages and
expectations and pre-venting the region from finding a sound economic footing,
however low that might have been. <B>David Shirreff</B> <BR>
<BR>
<H4>PRIVATIZATION INDEX </H4>
<H2>Measuring the world </H2>
Many investors are disenchanted with the poor share-price performance of
recent privatizations. But have privatization offerings been such a bad
investment? <BR>
<BR>
This is what the Global Index of Privatization Shares, launched over the
Christmas holidays by UK investment bank NM Rothschild and specialist magazine
<I>Privatisation International,</I> aims to find out. <BR>
<BR>
The index measures the stock-market performance of 204 companies which have
been privatized since 1980, with the list set to grow as new privatizations
occur. Published monthly, the index is denominated in US dollars and weighted
by market capitalization. <BR>
<BR>
Calculated back to 1990, the constituents of the Index of Privatization
Shares have performed better than those of the FT/S&amp;P Actuaries World
Index over the last five years. <BR>
<BR>
To be included in the index a company's initial public offering (IPO) must
have been over $25 million. This criterion excludes several partial privatizations
and seems slightly arbitrary. But Henry Gibbon, editor of <I>Privatisation
International</I>, thinks it won't distort the index much since &quot;all
the major privatized companies are included&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Over 100 of the constituent companies are European - including 39 UK firms.
A quarter are Asian and range from Singapore Telecom to Tsingtao Brewery
A shares in China. A few companies from Australasia, Africa, and North and
South America are also included. <BR>
<BR>
So the index achieves global coverage but, in so doing, mixes together data
for developed and emerging markets. <BR>
<BR>
Few institutions feel such indiscriminate enthusiasm for privatization stocks,
as selling governments have varying approaches to privatization which may
attract or repel investors. For instance, money raised from the sale of
a UK company goes into state coffers, but in return, the government cedes
control to the new investors. A company in China, however, is usually privatized
in order to raise foreign capital and effective control of the company may
still reside with the government rather than the private shareholders. So
the index has to cover a diverse range of privatization types. <BR>
<BR>
Its practical value is limited. After all, the majority of international
equity investment funds don't specialize in privatization shares. The reaction
of the non-specialists is summed up by Julian Johnston, director of Morgan
Grenfell Investment Services, who says that they &quot;look at privatizations
on a one-by-one basis&quot; so that the index is not &quot;directly useful
to us&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Reaction from the specialist funds highlights the difficulties of a generic
comparison. &quot;We're a European fund so we have to measure our performance
against a European index,&quot; says Vicky Sledden, senior fund manager
at Mercury Asset Management (MAM). But she would be interested in a European
version of the index, as would Simon White, managing director of the investment
funds division at Kleinwort Benson. <BR>
<BR>
It's hard to say how the new index will fare, says Andy Nybo, president
of Finmark Research, a database research company. He feels investors would
prefer indices which track specific emerging markets. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Privatisation International</I> confirms it is considering a breakdown
by geographical regions such as Europe and Asia. Certainly this would make
the index more user-friendly for investment funds. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, following interested calls from fund managers, there are plans
to make more detailed information available: a computer program developed
with NM Rothschild lifts data for the index from financial information providers
such as Datastream and Extel. <BR>
<BR>
The project isn't going to generate large profits for NM Rothschild - there
are few dedicated privatization funds - but supporting the index underlines
the bank's continued involvement in this area. Since the sale of its stake
in Smith New Court to Merrill Lynch last year, NM Rothschild has lost its
link into the daily rough and tumble of international equity trading. In
compiling the index, it hopes to position itself as an advisory firm that
is also attuned to the secondary markets. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Privatisation International</I> believes the index will do more than
just aid fund managers. It might be important to governments trying to overcome
&quot;increasing investor resistance to big privatization issues&quot;,
says the magazine's publicity material. <BR>
<BR>
Early privatizations were popular because the share sell-offs blatantly
undervalued the enterprises. A look at the appreciation in share prices
for some 1980s privatizations confirms this: British Aerospace: +405%; British
Telecom: +167%; Krung Thai Bank: +767% (all figures as at January 1996).
<BR>
<BR>
Now, fewer bargains are on offer. Although a few privatizations, such as
SGS Thomson (+51%) and Nordbanken (+22%), have done well, the share price
of 37 of the 62 indexed companies privatized since 1994 - including Japan
Tobacco (-38%), Renault (-17%) and Portugal Telecom (0%) - is either down
or unchanged. It's not surprising that investors' memories of earlier stock-market
successes are fading fast. <B>Dylan Drummond</B> <BR>

This is the big one, it rocks the country, it rocks the Beltway, it rocks
the bond market and it sure as fate rocks all those lardass VPs in head
office, so on no account let word of it leak out on those canasta afternoons
of yours, consider it classified Shred Before Reading. <BR>
<BR>
The trail leads to 21st and Constitution, stately abode of the US Federal
Reserve and of its feline chairman Alan Greenspan, but for me it begins
with a call from Representative Catwiesl, he wishes to know how I rate the
Draft Felix Rohatyn bandwagon, I tell him it passes me by but I figure the
sage of Lazard Fr&egrave;res is pushing it. <BR>
<BR>
Catwiesl explains how as the President prepares to run again he feels the
urgent need for friendly faces in the Fed, he needs some guys there who
believe in growth and prosperity and handing out the money to the voters,
at least until the second Tuesday in November, and he does not wish to be
tripped up in the home straight by some pedant who takes his remit literally
and gives rates a hoick just to be safe, campaigns are lost for less. <BR>
<BR>
He arranges to install some professor named Blinder who sees the big picture,
but somehow this prof gets seen off, and scoots back to Princeton for fear
that his tenure runs out, so now the idea is to send for Felix and to boost
him as the guy who saves New York when it is bust, or buster than usual.
<BR>
<BR>
This does not fly either, says Catwiesl, when Newt's first termers hear
the boost for Felix it brings them out against him in a posse, they figure
when Ford tells the city to drop dead he is a Gingrich born out of his time,
just think of the taxes we save if it does what he says. <BR>
<BR>
At this I figure it is high time I felt pulses in Washington, one thing
a banker needs to know is what color Fed he has to work with, also if the
right governor is truly hard to come by, maybe a guy with my experience
should sidle forward, tho' I quit this idea over the first martini when
Catwiesl tells me what the job pays. <BR>
<BR>
He explains how if the White House has its druthers, it cuts thru all the
rigmarole and just gives the Fed a nice new friendly chairperson, or if
not friendly then at least right on, like Donna Boom Boom Shalala, but they
fear this upsets the bond market and by now Greenspan teaches them the bond
market is important, it can tell everybody what to do, like reappointing
Chairman Greenspan. <BR>
<BR>
You have to hand it to him, he puts in a neat little cut in rates, and goes
on to give his testimony and explains how everything is right as rain, so
bonds blaze away and takes the Dow up into the wild blue yonder, and before
you can say Boom Boom the guy makes himself a sure thing, a slam dunk, and
a first for the Clinton administration, it finally chooses a white Republican
male who is 70 years old and straight with it. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Y</B>ou know, Herbie, Catwiesl says, I wish the Grand Old Party has a
few more white males who makes themselves slam dunks against the odds, it
can use one right now, just look at our guys in the primaries, one dorky
publisher, one nutty publicist, one southern governor like a Republican
Clinton, and one veteran on his last hurrah or maybe the hurrah after that,
I tell you, Herbie, I would not back any of them for a nickel to beat a
fat man from here to the bar down the street. <BR>
<BR>
Mom, this is when the bulb over your boy's head lights up in red, white
and blue, I call up the next martinis and tell Catwiesl to chew on his and
keep his mouth shut while he hears about the game plan that will change
everything. <BR>
<BR>
OK, I say, it is summer and convention time, the bond market tops out but
never fear, Greenspan is here, maybe he puts in another little cut or two,
just to keep the economy from getting stupid, and the polls say so too,
they give Clinton licking every candidate in sight, and a mission is sent
out to ask Colin Powell one more time, and he says not this time. <BR>
<BR>
What happens then, listen to it, first a whisper, then a murmur spreading
from the smoke-filled rooms to set the floor alight, and cheer after cheer
as you stride to the platform to launch the party's secret weapon, you tell
them: I nominate a great Republican a great American and a surefire proven
winner, the bond market's favorite son, Alan Greenspan! <BR>
<BR>
So the hall erupts and our man is the candidate by acclamation. All that
remains is to go find him and tell him, and to rustle up someone to run
with him, Mom, I can see this goes down with Catwiesl like a third martini,
he is the boy who always wants to be VP and now he can write his own ticket.
<BR>
<BR>
It sure is a ticket to ride, and the polls say so too, for a new-minted
credible candidate they swing right round, but also from now on policy begins
to tighten, just one or two neat little rate hikes here and there, or maybe
three, some guy in the Fed who takes his remit literally, but the economy
starts to look stupid, and nothing does so much to make a president look
stupid, as the previous president finds out. <BR>
<BR>
By the time November comes our guy is a slam dunk for the White House, and
up he loops down into the basket, he carries every state except maybe Arkansas,
so then he puts in a neat little rate cut to celebrate, and packs his bag
and strolls down Constitution on the way to his new office, and creates
another vacancy. <BR>
<BR>
Catwiesl agrees I have first claim on this, unless I happen to prefer an
embassy, but I kinda fancy myself in the chair, so long as we can fix the
compensation, maybe the Fed takes over the note issue from the Treasury
and keeps a few for me, we tell Newt this is privatization. <BR>
<BR>
All we have to do now is get Greenspan on side, Catwiesl asks me do I care
to tackle him but I dare say he already has it figured out, much love from
<BR>
<BR>

<H3> Harrison moves to integrate debt,
equity capital markets </H3> 

<P> CONTINUING the organisational shake up that has
characterised his still-short reign at <B>BZW</B>, chief executive Bill Harrison
has moved to reshape key portions of the bank's operations.

<P> In the most radical element of the reorganisation, the equity and debt
capital markets will be formed into an integrated unit under Amir Eilon,
previously head of equity capital markets. The integrated capital market
operations will include loan syndications.

<P> Graham Pimlott, chief executive of the merchant banking division of BZW, and
the man who brought loan syndication into the investment banking operations, will
become director of planning, operations and technology for the Barclays Group in
early 1997.

<P> The corporate finance and investment banking divisions of the investment bank
will also be merged, with Mark Seligman and Richard Gillingwater as co-heads.  


<P> David Corbell is joining <B>IBJ International </B>as part of JJ Vellacott's
syndicate team. He was previously new issue trader at Daiwa Europe.

<P> Dario Lizzano has joined <B>Santander Investment</B> in Buenos Aires as a
vice president and head of Argentine equity research.

<P> He will report to Juan Carlos Garcia, senior vice president in Latin American
equity research.

<H3> <B>Mexico, Argentina fly in face of markets as YPF issue held</B> </H3> 

<P> <H4><B>MARKETS for
Latin American issuers gave off conflicting signals  this week over the prospects
for a happy end to a wonderful year. Mexico and Argentina both launched
successful issues, while Argentinian oil group YPF postponed a planned Yankee
bond because of adverse market conditions. </H4></B>

Bankers, borrowers and investors
remain unsure about the potential for continued high levels of activity from the
region's borrowers for the rest of the year and into 1997.

<P> After the difficulties surrounding the launch of Brazil's maiden $750m
five-year global last week, many bankers had feared that Latin issuance would dry
up as US investors, who have been the principal buyers of such paper in recent
months, took profits.

<P> The correction in prices from a three-week sell off led to the postponement
this week of an expected $200m Yankee offering for YPF, considered to be among
the best of Latin America's corporate credits.

<P> Bankers said the downturn in  sentiment toward the deal meant that lead
manager Merrill Lynch was unable to match the aggressive levels that YPF was
seeking.

<P> However, signs of life for Latin issuers were still easy to detect in the
European markets, where Mexico launched the first floating-rate emerging market
lira transaction, and Argentina surprised the market with a second Swiss franc
offering. Both found ready demand for their paper.

<P> US appetite was gauged this week by the largest ever Rule 144A structured
deal for Brazil with a $400m offering from Alcoa Brazil. It will be further
tested by Chilean corporate Enersis' $500m Yankee later in the month.

<P> Several Latin sovereigns have already made plans for their 1997 funding
programmes. The Mexican budget presented to congress on Thursday allowed for up
to $5bn of net foreign borrowing next year.

<P> Finance ministry spokesman Alejandro Valenzuela said: "We expect to have good
access to the markets that will allow us to continue with our refinancing plans."

<P> Colombia announced plans to raise $2.8bn in the foreign markets in 1997, of
which about $1.8bn would be raised through public sovereign debt issues.

<P> And Argentina, which many bankers thought had completed its financing
requirements for the year, is considering a further $2bn funding spree in the
coming weeks to contribute towards its debt amortisation burden in the  year
ahead.

<P> This week's Sfr200m seven-year offering via Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and
Paribas may be followed by a $120m issue in the lira market and between
$200m-$500m of yen-denominated bonds, as well as up to $500m in domestic bonds.

<P> This week, Argentine economy minister Roque Fernandez said that the republic
would have to raise at least $8.5bn in the international markets in 1997.

<H3> Europe takes centre stage </H3> 

<P> WITH CONCERNS emerging
that a strengthening of the yen could hit the US Treasury market and the future
head of the European Monetary Institute predicting that the Euro could overtake
the dollar as the world's core currency, it was perhaps fitting that attention
this week focused on European currencies and dollar activity was limited.

<P> The biggest dollar straight of the week, KDB's $500m seven-year global via
Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan at 49bp over Treasuries, received a lukewarm
reaction.

<P> One of the highlights of the week was the EIB's capped and floored Tec-10
linked offering via Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, which was
increased from Ffr1bn to Ffr1.5bn on the back of overwhelming demand.

<P> The combination of arbitrage opportunities for issuers and relatively high
domestic institutional demand looks likely to sustain the relatively heavy
volumes of Ffr issuance in weeks to come.

<P> Prior to next Wednesday's auction of Cades bonds, Aussie telecoms group
Telstra is expected to issue Ffr1.5bn of 10-year bonds at around the 25bp over
level via BNP and JP Morgan.

<P> Crediop, via Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, and NordLB, with
CDC as lead manager, are two more certain future issuers, while Fannie Mae will
conduct roadshows with Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale on November
18-20 before deciding whether to proceed with a deal.

<P> Other borrowers looking to the markets for opportunities are said to be
Eurofima, either in five-year dollars or DM, and Chugoku for seven years,
possibly in sterling.

<P> ICO is set to roadshow its expected $500m+ transaction at the end of the
month with a view to launching a transaction in early December, and with five
years a more likely maturity than 10.

<P> And the Woolwich Building Society is eyeing a perpetual sterling fixed-rate
offering, with a step-up after 20 or 25 years. HSBC, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson
and CS First Boston are the leading contenders for the mandate.

<P> To complete the European flavour, Mexico issued its first floating-rate lira
notes and Argentina tapped the Swiss franc market for only the second time.

<P> But YPF's proposed $200m Yankee was postponed because of the downturn in
sentiment towards Latin credits in the US.

<H3>AGAINST THE TIDE </H3>
<H2>Japan's orderly reversal </H2>
<B>by David Roche</B> <BR>
<BR>
Will Japan recover? Will the government be able to reverse the policy of
corporations and institutions during the recession - namely buying yen-denominated
assets rather than US securities? Will Japan once again resume the serious
business of recycling its surpluses abroad? Will Japanese government bond
prices finally fall back along with the value of the yen? Answers to these
questions will tell you which way Japanese financial markets will go in
1996. <BR>
<BR>
Japan is a country you can only judge by being there. What makes it so difficult
to judge from a distance is not the fast pace of change but the lack of
it. Every time you leave, your mind starts to fill the vacuum of reform
with imaginary changes. But when you return, they haven't happened. <BR>
<BR>
That's because there is no great build-up of popular pressure for change.
And foreigners will not set the course when it comes to Japanese financial
assets. The Japanese will. The game will be played by their rules. If you
ignore that, you will get the market wrong. <BR>
<BR>
In order to understand what is happening in Japan we must start with the
process of wealth creation which is key to a society's success or failure.
Wealth creation sets a society's ability to pay a real rate of interest
on its debt. And it lies at the heart of social stability too. For example,
a rising middle class is a sure sign of economic lift-off in emerging economies.
The failure to create wealth was the harbinger of communist collapse. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Spreading, not creating</B> <BR>
<BR>
Japan is no exception. But it is an unusual example. I believe that Japan
stopped creating wealth three years ago. It is now spreading the existing
stock around so as to maintain social stability. But too much wealth-spreading
stops its creation and so Japan will not create much wealth for the foreseeable
future. In the short term, wealth-spreading ensures social and political
peace so that reforms are achieved at a Japanese pace - slowly. But in the
long term, it may not prevent the necessity for wrenching social and political
change as Japan's ageing population produces a ratio of working to non-working
citizens of 2:1 by early next century. The state faces rising debts and
deficits while the pool of savings to fund them falls. <BR>
<BR>
Japan's wealth-spreading is different from Europe's. It is a corporate welfare
state. Japanese management is involved in a massive break-even production
exercise because it gets more benefit from keeping everything predictable
and stable than by boosting return on equity (in which it doesn't share).
<BR>
<BR>
For years, any visitor to Japan was struck by the modest living standards
of one of the world's richest economies. This was no accident. Between 1970
and 1995, Japanese export prices were flat but consumer prices rose over
200%, while wages lagged prices up to 1988. <BR>
<BR>
Post-war Japan rebuilt itself on the back of the Japanese household/consumer
and accumulated massive wealth in corporations in doing so. That's why Mr
and Mrs Suzuki can't afford a house in their own country but corporations
were able to drive the price of land and other assets to absurd levels.
<BR>
<BR>
International competitiveness was the paramount goal. Domestic competition
was anathema. Domestic overpricing was used to subsidize international competitiveness.
In other words, the salaryman was kept poor in order to subsidize export
companies and their suppliers. Lack of domestic competition kept prices
high, real wages and salaries low and profits at an unnaturally high share
of GDP. The pay-off for the workforce was lifetime employment. The benefit
for society was stability. <BR>
<BR>
Now bottom-up pressure, not a reformist political leadership, is destroying
that social contract. Consumer prices are falling. Imports of cheap goods
- often made by Japanese factories newly moved abroad - are soaring. Price
deflation is there to stay. <BR>
<BR>
But it is not the sort of deflationary spiral which heralds immediate social
collapse. It just means the trade account surplus is shrinking fast. Employment
in Japan is stable. Unemployment has risen because new job applicants can't
find work. But those in work keep their jobs. Wages and bonus payments taken
together (and weighted at about 70:30) are continuing to rise slightly in
real terms. <BR>
<BR>
Corporate rationalization Japanese-style, which moves salarymen from good
jobs to bad ones, does not reduce household earnings power. In fact, in
this static economy, wage share is rising and profit share is falling. That
means people are taking home more money not less. The casualty of that,
though, is corporate profits. <BR>
<BR>
That's the salaryman's revenge. Corporate wealth is being liquidated to
keep Mr and Mrs Suzuki relatively prosperous - if not exactly happy. Employment
(and over-employment) is being paid for by the corporate's P&amp;L, not
the government's. And Japan's version of PPP (Pricing Power to the People)
is forcing Japanese corporations abroad to compete in Japanese markets by
producing cheap imports. But any profits Japan Inc makes abroad will have
to be sent back home to fund employment. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Steady growth needed</B> <BR>
<BR>
That's why Japanese output, far from collapsing, remains very stable. The
consumer takes home enough pay to keep the economy ticking over. Mr and
Mrs Suzuki also save enough and continue to put it into the banks (which
cannot lend) to keep the banking system highly liquid - although highly
insolvent. That's why a financial collapse is a million miles away too.
<BR>
<BR>
How long can this wealth-spreading corporate-style last? The answer is:
until pressure for social change forces an end to it. It is a truism of
history that relatively wealthy economic systems that stop creating wealth
can take a hell of a long time to liquidate enough wealth to collapse. Communism
was a case in point. In Japan, the enormous wealth amassed by the corporate
sector will be liquidated to pay for social stability. But it's a slow process.
And the only pressure for change in the meantime will come from young job-seekers.
To avoid that, Japan must have some growth but not a lot. <BR>
<BR>
The need for some steady growth lies behind the Japanese ministry of finance's
(MoF) policy of &quot;orderly reversal&quot;: achieving a weak yen in order
to reinstall confidence in the Japanese economy by using rising earnings
and investment from blue-chip exporters to get things moving. <BR>
<BR>
On my visit to Japan, the MoF told me that it wants the yen lower than today's
&#165;100 to the dollar. But it has no specific target. It will gauge the
right level of the yen by the pace of economic recovery. The MoF believes
the yen will fall further because market forces will drive capital offshore.
It thinks that Japanese government bonds (JGBs) are an unattractive investment
- 3% yield in a falling currency is poor compared with high-yielding overseas
bonds - given that life insurance companies have a required actuarial rate
of return averaging 4.5%. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Bonds &agrave; la mode</B> <BR>
<BR>
So everything's fine then? No. The snag is this. Japanese life insurance
companies and banks don't trust the MoF. For them, default risk aside, bond
risk is just the risk of currency fluctuation. So that's why for them JGBs
have zero risk. For foreign bonds to be a better investment, life insurance
companies would have to be convinced that global yield spreads don't forecast
future exchange rate shifts (for example, that over the next 10 years the
US dollar won't decline by 4% a year against the yen - the difference between
US and Japanese bond yields over that period). So far they are not. <BR>
<BR>
Japanese housewives are doing more than the life companies to bring down
the yen! It's now as fashionable to own foreign bonds (not equities) as
it is to own Pierre Cardin diamond-studded earrings. Housewives, in aggregate,
are now investing $4 billion to $5 billion a month in foreign bonds (up
from $2 billion to $3 billion a few months ago), and will invest more as
a raft of high-yielding Japanese debt that they already own matures over
the coming quarters. The huge appetite of individuals for high-yielding
overseas bonds will help. But it's not enough on its own to lower the yen.
<BR>
<BR>
And the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is simply not doing what the market believes
it is. The consensus is that the BoJ is targeting power (narrow) money instead
of short-term interest rates, and that it aims to hold down long-term interest
rates by purchasing long-term JGBs. <BR>
<BR>
Neither is true. The BoJ is not trying to hold down long-term rates and
does not believe it could if it tried. And the BoJ is only injecting liquidity
to meet increased demand. There is no question of the BoJ abandoning stable
and low short-term interest rates as its target and switching to monitoring
power money. There is no sign of the rising volatility in short-term interest
rates that such a policy change would cause. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, I think JGB yields will eventually rise. In the short term,
that's because as successive stimulation packages kick in, the government's
budget deficit will rise towards 7% to 8% of GDP. <BR>
<BR>
In the medium term, four factors will push JGB yields up, if only gradually.
First, rising debt and deficits will be enhanced by the increased cost of
an ageing population. Second, national savings by households and government
will fall and so will savings by corporations in order to fund hidden unemployment.
Third<I>,</I> there will be a big drop in BoJ bond operations next year.
<BR>
<BR>
And finally, there will be rising capital outflows and falling domestic
demand for JGBs. I reckon that long-term private sector capital outflows
have to reach $130 billion annually for the yen to stay weak. I believe
that Japan is about to start recycling long-term private capital instead
of recycling short-term capital through the BoJ and its authorized commercial
banks as it has done since 1990. And next year, I expect Japan's long-term
private sector capital outflows to be much bigger than in recent years and
for the first time since 1990, bigger than its shrinking current surplus.
<BR>
<BR>
So Japan's financial assets appear to be moving like a Japanese Noh play.
The drama is between two players. The MoF and the BoJ are on stage. The
life insurance companies are extras. To foreign eyes, Noh plays lack all
dramatic tension and the story unfolds at snail-like pace. So too will it
be with Japan's orderly reversal.<BR>

<H3>  <B> NatWest sets landmark $5bn loan securitisation</B> </H3> 

<P> <H4>NATWEST BANK is to securitise $5bn
of corporate loans in a transaction that will create one of the largest
asset-backed securities in the international markets.</H4>

The ground-breaking
operation could also signal major changes in the way that commercial banks
finance much of their lending business.

<P> The exercise will involve selling off around 300 relatively low-margin
corporate loans, freeing up capital and credit lines, and beginning NatWest's
shift from wholesale holder of corporate credits to generator and distributor.

<P> The offering -- signalled in <I>Euroweek</I> last week -- is provisionally
slated for launch on October 28. The bonds will be issued as multi-tranche FRNs
and sold via Cayman Islands-registered special purpose vehicle ROSE Funding
Group.

<P> Up to half of the FRNs are set to be financed via a commercial paper conduit
with the rest being sold to investors worldwide.

<P> The ROSE offering will be the latest in a series of high-profile
international structured financings that have vividly demonstrated the variety of
uses to which the technology of securitisation can be turned.

<P> The transaction also confirms NatWest as being in the front rank of this
market, whose development in recent months has been rapid.

<P> "This utilises all of our structuring, origination and distribution skills,"
said Alby Cator, managing director and head of debt markets at NatWest Markets.
"It allows us to employ our balance sheet in a more sophisticated manner to
<BR> service clients' needs."

<P> The transaction will securitise loans advanced to investment grade companies
in the US, UK and the rest of Europe -- a business that has long attracted fierce
competition and correspondingly low margins.

<P> Securitising part of this portfolio releases capital for general group use --
around &#163;250m from this transaction alone -- and will free up
sometimes-clogged credit lines to individual companies.

<P> Cator points out that many companies are reducing the number of banks they
are prepared to do business with, increasing the demands placed on the inner
circle left with a relationship.

<P> That has created exposure problems with some clients, problems that can be
alleviated by moving a portion of the loans off-balance sheet.

<P> "This releases further financing and allows us to continue lending," said
Cator, explaining that the securitisation functioned like a credit derivative by
transferring exposure to another market where it could be more easily
accommodated.

<P> Bruce Bantz, head of securitisation at NatWest in London, pointed out that
the issue had a further advantage: pooling 300 separate credits allowed the
rating agencies to analyse the portfolio on an 'actuarial' basis rather than
one-by-one, allowing higher-rated securities to be created with less credit
enhancement than would be necessary for more lumpy pools.

<P> NatWest is working with four rating agencies -- Duff &amp; Phelps, Fitch,
Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's -- using cashflow and default models adapted
from those originally developed for US collateralised bond and loan obligations.

<P> The precise shape of the bond structure has yet to be put in place but it is
already clear that the notes will be tranched by credit, average life and,
likely, currency.

<P> Corporate loans are relatively short-term, amortising assets and the longest
legal maturity on the bonds is set at five years.

<P> The bulk of the notes will be sold in dollars, reflecting the greater
international appeal of the currency, although there will be a sterling element
to fund underlying loans denominated in the UK currency.

<P> Although the rating levels have also yet to be finalised, the highest-rated
securities may be set at the double-A level -- beyond this point issues of
industry and credit exposure in the pool may bulk large enough to make triple-A
credit enhancement levels unduly onerous.

<P> Whatever rating levels are eventually settled on, the notes will be pitched
to tap into the strong international demand for Libor-plus floating rate assets,
demonstrated repeatedly in structured transactions throughout this year.

<P> Given the intensity of this bid, asset-backed bankers said that discounted
margins on the 100% risk-weighted notes might come in as low as 10bp over Libor,
depending on rating and expected average life.

<P> Around half of the transaction is expected to be financed via the purchase of
floating rate notes by a conduit to be established by NatWest within the ROSE
Group.

<P> NatWest's Bantz noted that fine funding levels on offer in the US commercial
paper market should create price tension within the issue, driving down margins
on the publicly-offered bonds. (Conduits can currently issue paper at margins in
a range centring just above Libor in the US.)

<P> Financing the whole issue via the CP markets is not, however,  an option; the
bank wants to ensure that committed term funding remains part of the overall
equation.

<P> The public bonds will be offered after a roadshow taking in London, Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Bahrain, Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg, together with a series of
one-to-one meetings with US qualified buyers under the 144A clause. Beginning on
October 7, the pre-marketing process will finish on October 24, in advance of the
provisional launch date of October 28.

<P> While some form of syndicate seems essential for such a large offering, no
names are yet public, although Greenwich Capital seems certain to play a role in
the US portion of the offering.

<P> The issue will not be NatWest's first securitisation of its own assets -- it
parcelled up &#163;300m of residential mortgages in September 1993 and financed
&#163;1bn of corporate loans via a conduit set up in 1991 -- but the latest move
represents a step forward into a new dimension by using securitisation technology
to re-engineer the way the bank does business.

<P> But if NatWest is the first European bank to emerge with a transaction, it is
unlikely to be the last. A BZW spokesman said the bank had looked at securitising
large corporate loans for some time, although residential mortgages and personal
loan-backed transactions have taken priority (a stalled commercial mortgage
transaction is also believed to have been recently revived).

<P> Until now BZW and others have concentrated on secondary market trading and
sell-downs as a means of injecting liquidity into the market for corporate debt.

<P> Efforts to increase the tradeability of corporate loans have often generated
suspicion that the traditional links between bank and company will be altered.

<P> NatWest said the proposed securitisation would not change this relationship;
the bank would continue to administer the loans in exactly the same manner as
before the sale.

<P> And in the event of a borrower default the bank, as lender of record, would
find its interests aligned with the holders of the loan-backed securities in
seeking to extract the maximum and most timely payment on the loan.

<P> NatWest has already written to corporate borrowers whose loans may be
eligible for inclusion in the pool, although it will not specify which loans
finally go in.

<P> The eventual selection of the securitised loans will be driven by a complex
mix of separate motives, including credit; all loans in the underlying pool must
be at least investment grade or equivalent.

<P> Despite being imposed by the rating agencies for the purpose of this
transaction, that requirement squares nicely with the economics that, partly,
brought NatWest along the securitisation route in the first place.

<P> Although very high-quality corporates often have substantial loan facilities
in place these are often lightly used as the company can typically obtain cheaper
funding in the capital markets.

<P> Ultra-high quality assets also possess razor-thin margins, which if
introduced into the pool in sufficient size might reduce its ability to generate
enough yield to pay bondholders.

<P> Banks are also happy to hold sub-investment grade loans; these instruments
are relatively high-yielding and internal credit functions give the banks a
comparative advantage over capital markets.

<P> Companies just above investment grade are typically the heaviest users of the
loan market, and at very fine rates; it is this type of business that forms the
core of the NatWest securitisation.

<P>
<H3>TRADING PLACES </H3>

<P> Bernard Attali has been appointed managing director and president director
general of <B>Bankers Trust France</B>. He will be responsible for managing
Bankers Trust's activities in France and will play a key role in implementing the
bank's global strategy in the areas of mergers and acquisitions, property,
corporate finance, capital markets sales and trading, and risk management
services in the French market.

<P> He reports to Philippe Souviron, vice chairman of the bank and head of its
European office network and European client origination group.

<P> Before 1993, Attali was chairman of Air France and, previous to that, 
chairman of GAN Insurance Group. He has also been a member of the board of
directors of Matra Group, A&eacute;rospatiale, Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, CIC, BNP, and Meridien Hotels Group among other companies
and state agencies.

<P> "Attali is an outstanding leader with a unique and diversified experience as
manager of first-class French companies from various sectors, which are all very
important to our business," said Souviron.

<P> David Johnson has joined <B>Bankers Trust New York Corp </B>as a managing
director in its Geneva office. He will be a member of the firm's private equity
finance group.

<P> Johnson is responsible for distributing private equity securities to European
and Middle Eastern investors and for originating placing mandates from European
private equity sponsors. He reports to Charles Daughery, managing director and
head of the private equity finance group in New York.

<P> He joins from MeesPierson, the Dutch merchant bank, where he was a director
and head of the investment finance division in Switzerland, raising capital for
private equity and leveraged buyout funds.

<P> <B>BZW</B> has appointed Nigel Rankine to the new position of director and
head of risk advisory. He will advise the firm's corporate clients on risk
management and currency issue associated with transactions.

<P> He joins from Morgan Stanley, where he held a similar role as investment
banking currency adviser.

<P> "Rankine is one of the most highly regarded currency professionals in the
City," said Alex von Ungern-Sternberg, global head of treasury products. "As an
experienced risk management adviser with an impressive track record of success in
this business, he will enhance our ability to provide our clients with
appropriate solutions and innovative ideas to manage risk."

<P> <B>Credit Suisse Group</B> has again recruited a new chief financial officer
from its CS First Boston investment banking arm.

<P> Richard Thornburgh replaces Philip Colebatch, who has been appointed chief
executive of Credit Suisse Asset Management. Both appointments will take effect
at the end of this year.

<P> Thornburgh has been chief financial and administrative officer of CS First
Boston for just over a year. His old role will be taken up by Stephen Hester,
currently CSFB's co-head of European investment banking.

<H3> PEOPLE </H3>

<P> Peter d'Amario, director of global securities banking at <B>BZW</B>, has left
the firm. It is not yet clear if he has already found another position. D'Amario
was brought in from Goldman Sachs to pep up BZW's repo operation, especially in
the light of the liberalisation of the Gilt repo market.

<P> He had worked in tandem with Euan Harkness, head of Gilts at BZW. His move is
the latest in a series of appointments and resignations since the arrival at BZW
of Bob Diamond as head of global markets.

<P> Mark Hopkinson has joined <B>CIBC Wood Gundy</B> in London as a managing
director. He will co-head the group's European business activity with Edmond
Horsey, a director who recently moved to London from the firm's New York office.

<P> Hopkinson is to be responsible for developing and implementing tax-based
structured financing opportunities. Horsey will focus specifically on leasing
opportunities. Both report to Mark Cosens, managing director and head of global
asset-based finance.

<P> <B>HSBC Markets</B> has announced two hirings. Christopher Dubais joins as a
senior vice president in charge of the French market for primary bond issues and
structured finance. He was previously with Chase Manhattan Bank in Paris, where
he was in charge of structured finance.

<P> Philippe Laroche takes charges of derivatives and structured finance for
French corporate and institutional clients. He is operating out of Paris and
London. Laroche was formerly a specialist in risk management with Chase Manhattan
Bank in Paris.

<P> Thomas Demeure has been appointed a director in <B>Salomon Brothers</B>'
financial institutions group (FIG) of the European investment banking division in
London. He will be involved in M&amp;A transactions for financial institutions
throughout Europe and will have specific coverage responsibilities for France and
Benelux. He reports to Richard Boath, managing and head of FIG in Europe.

<P> Prior to this appointment, Demeure was an executive director with Morgan
Stanley's financial institutions group.

<P> Carlos Craide, executive director of corporate banking and products at
Citibank Brazil, has been named the new president of <B>Bank of Boston</B>'s unit
in Brazil. He takes over the role from Henrique Meirelles on October 4.

<P> Five bond salesmen have left Commerzbank Frankfurt to join <B>Deutsche
Bank</B> -- one in London and four in Frankfurt. They are specialists in domestic
bond sales to institutional investors. Commerzbank denied that this move would
paralyse its business in that area, although the defections have halved the
bank's domestic team.

<P> Jean Solandt, a director of <B>Schroders plc</B>, group managing director
financial markets, and chairman of J Henry Schroder &amp; Co, is retiring at the
end of 1996. He has been with the group for 28 years, during which time he has
built up its financial markets business into one of its core activities.

<P> David Challen, vice chairman of J Henry Schroder &amp; Co, will succeed
Solandt as chairman of the firm, with effect from January 1, 1997.

<P> Schroders has also announced that John Govett, group managing director asset
management and chairman of Schroder Investment Management, has been appointed to
the board of Schroders plc with immediate effect. He will hand over the
chairmanship of Schroder Investment Management at the end of the year.

<P> David Salisbury and Hugh Bolland, joint chief executives of Schroders
Investment Management, take up the roles of chairman and chief executive
respectively from January 1, 1997.

<P> Andrew Sykes, head of financial markets Europe, and Mark Hopkinson, head of
financial markets Asia, will become joint group managing directors financial
markets from October 1.

<P> <B>ABN AMRO Hoare Govett</B> is to acquire Causeway Group, a UK independent
manager of development capital funds. The funds, which have approximately
&#163;300m under management, provide development capital for the UK's unquoted
and quoted sectors, and have been subscribed to by over 80 institutions from the
UK and the US.

<P> After the acquisition, Causeway will operate within the framework of the ABN
AMRO investment banking network. It will also provide a platform for ABN's
private equity business in the UK and will operate closely with the bank's global
private equity network.

<P> Causeway will continue its existing activities with the present management
team led by Lionel Anthony, one of the founding directors. The new company will
be called ABN AMRO Causeway.

<P> <B>EASDAQ</B>, the pan-European stockmarket for growth companies, became
technically operational this Thursday, with the first quotation due to start in
October. Some 10 to 15 companies are expected to be quoted by the end of the
year.

<P> The venture was set up in response to a shortage of equity finance for growth
companies in Europe, and is supported by the European Commission.

<H3> Arbitrage in short supply </H3> <P> 

THE new issue market
displayed a curious lethargy this week as participants waited for Tuesday's FOMC
interest rate decision only to launch a handful of notable transactions as lack
of arbitrage across the major sectors slowed the recent burst of activity.

<P> Standing out from the crowd was a $800m 10-year transaction for East Japan
Railway, lead managed by Goldman Sachs and IBJ, which gave investors a rare
credit play following the stream of Japanese government-guaranteed issuers in
dollars.

<P> Demand for floating-rate dollars was once again highlighted as a number of
transactions in a range of maturities were launched in the aftermath of last
week's $2bn blow-out from the United Kingdom, with $500m five-year deals by
Midland Bank and Westpac the pick of the bunch.

<P> The lira market saw a continued flow of long-dated zero coupon bonds, with
Lit4.5tr issued in three deals from EIB, Deutsche Bank and Rabobank.

<P> Cades launched its third bond market triumph with a Ffr12bn return to the
French domestic market via BNP and Cr&eacute;dit Agricole. A dollar debut could
now follow before the end of the year.

<P> The Czech koruna market moved on another step with its first global bond,
a Ck2bn one-year offering for the World Bank via ING Barings.

<P> Before attention in the emerging markets turned to the forthcoming
inaugural dollar global from Brazil, the Philippines caught the eye with a $690m
Eurobond issue in exchange for its Brady debt, set at a new benchmark level of
225bp over Treasuries.

<P> In the sterling market, EIB took advantage of recent tightening of its
&#163;400m 10-year bond to launch a new &#163;200m tap issue at a spread of just
7bp over Gilts. 

<P> Next week is likely to see a $250m 10-year transaction for City of
Yokohama via TMI at 26bp-28bp over, with a similar deal for TransTokyo Bay to
follow the week after.

<P> And British Colombia is expected with a Ffr1.5bn-Ffr2bn offering following
completion of roadshows in France this week, with lead manager Paribas looking at
a spread of 18bp to 20bp for 10 years.

<P>

<H3>SOUTH AFRICA </H3>


<H2> <B>Facing up to the foreigners</B> </H2> 
 
 <H4>
<B>The new dawn in South Africa is not an unmixed blessing for its banks. They
now have to face foreign competitors muscling in on a sector they previously
monopolized. But with their strong networks and increasing overseas resources,
local banks are finding that alliances with foreign institutions can be mutually
beneficial. Bruce Cameron reports</B> </H4> 

<P> When the South African government
announced last month that HSBC Investment Bank was to be its adviser on
privatization, it took the wind out of the sails of the major domestic banks.
There was, though, still a local connection: HSBC subsidiary James Capel recently
bought South African stockbroker Simpson McKie, now Simpson McKie James Capel.

<P> The snatching of the one-year advisory deal does not mean that South African
banks are being altogether sidelined as foreign competition builds up. But it
does show that local bankers no longer have it all their own way, which had been
the case since such foreign banks as Barclays and Standard Chartered withdrew at
the height of the sanctions and sold out extensive local operations.

<P> Since the April 1994 elections, 55 foreign banks have set up operations in
South Africa, while others enter and leave on ad hoc tasks in what the local
bankers call "parachute operations". None of the foreigners has so far attempted
to get into the retail market. Local bankers believe only Citibank is capable of
doing so, but doubt that it will at this stage.

<P> In general foreign competitors can't expect an easy ride. Since the lifting
of sanctions and a consequent explosion in business local banks have upgraded and
restructured their merchant bank activities &#173; particularly the broad-based
service banks, such as Standard Bank and First National Bank (formerly Barclays)
which restructured their merchant and investment banking arms last year. Standard
Merchant Bank was expanded into Standard Corporate &amp; Merchant Bank, which is
responsible for all wholesale business; First National Bank restructured itself
into three divisions: retail; corporate and institutional; and finance, risk and
group communications.

<P> Two merchant banks that retained their existing merchant and investment bank
profiles were Rand Merchant Bank and Investec. Both have recorded sound growth on
the back of an expanding market: in 1995 Investec grew by 44% and Rand Merchant
Bank by 36%. Most local banks are actively joining in the global fray, but some
still tend to be inwardly focused on more traditional areas such as mergers and
acquisitions, structured finance, and money market and foreign exchange dealing.

<P> Generally, South African banks are comparable with the best but are somewhat
lacking in international experience, including such areas as privatization. Local
bankers claim they suffer from some local corporates incorrectly believing they
do not have the expertise to raise money on international capital markets.

<P> All the major banks have had footholds offshore for many years and have
recently been expanding these operations rapidly, says Div Geeringh, senior
general manager of the Standard Bank Group of South Africa, which put together a
consortium of local black-owned business and international advisers to bid for
the privatization advisory job. He admits that local banks could be slightly
behind in research, but says the lag is being rapidly overcome. Local banks also
argue that they are prepared to take risks, while foreign banks are looking
mainly for fee-paying business. Geeringh believes that both local and foreign
businesses would prefer to deal through a South African bank for local deals
because of such factors as extensive local networks. He adds that if the
perception persists that local banks cannot handle international transactions or
raise capital offshore, then such experience will never be built up.

<P> Stephen Koseff, managing director of aggressive and comparatively young
banking group Investec, is forthright: "South African banks don't have to run and
hide." Koseff says South African banks are not only keen and able to take on
foreign competitors on their home turf but are also prepared to face up to them
on foreign soil in some market niches. His bank has a foothold in the Netherlands
and in London, and has acquired a banking group in Israel &#173; Israel General
Bank &#173; from Baron Edmund de Rothschild, subject to the approval of bank
regulatory authorities..

<P> All major South African banks have set up offices offshore. First National
Bank owns London-based Henry Ansbacher, which last year acquired the Jersey-based
offshore private banking operations of Westpac Banking Corp of Australia. And
Standard Bank has extended its London-based subsidiary, Standard London, to Hong
Kong and New York. South Africa's largest bank, Amalgamated Banks of South
Africa, which trades in the retail market under four brand names, established
Absa Securities in New York and bought Bankhaus W&ouml;lbern in Hamburg.

<P> <B>International competence</B>

<P> Koseff says that South African banks can raise money internationally, with
most having developed the capacity to act for South African corporates. "We did a
convertible bond issue of $100 million recently, advised by Citibank," he says.
"They gave advice but the selling was done by us. I don't believe that it is
difficult to develop international networks." Foreign operations will expand as
foreign exchange controls on South African residents are further eased.

<P> Both Geeringh and Koseff say that although competition has increased, their
institutions are not feeling any heat, because with the lifting of sanctions the
market has grown dramatically. South African institutions have also found that
their fees are considerably lower than foreign institutions, enabling them to
increase them while still offering keener pricing.

<P> Koseff says foreign banks claim to have made about R300 million ($88 million)
in profits last year from operations in South Africa, but he argues that most of
this came from cherry-picking rather than offering broad services. So far,
foreign banks operate mainly in corporate finance, treasury operations and
securities.

<P> Mark Barnes, deputy managing director of Standard Corporate &amp; Merchant
Bank, says that not only do the larger local banks have the networks, but they
also have strong balance sheets and a capacity for coping with credit risk and
country risk that is not shared by foreign banks.

<P> Standard Bank's international competitiveness was reflected in its being the
primary market-maker in the rand. "We have always been able to make a price even
in these volatile times," says Barnes. This, he believes, gives his bank a
definite edge over foreign competition. Foreign banks, however, may well have a
lower cost in raising trade finance denominated in foreign currencies.

<P> More foreign banks means increased competition for staff. "There is a limited
and expensive skills base," says Barnes. "The foreign banks have been able to
attract local staff with one-off hikes in remuneration packages and the lure of
foreign-based appointments. Essentially, they are attempting to buy local contact
networks."

<P> But access to networks is not enough. The foreign banks have been limited in
the amount and type of business they can take on without back-office settlement
and credit-assessment capabilities.

<P> Despite the initial advisory role on privatization having gone to HSBC,
Barnes believes that when it comes to the merchant banking involved with the
actual privatization programme, local banks will still have an important role to
play. Altogether, it is estimated the government is planning to raise about R100
billion from privatization over the next decade.

<P> Koseff points out that Investec has already been active in some smaller
privatizations worth up to R1 billion, such as selling off some of state radio
and TV operator SABC's stations. When it comes to bigger sell-offs, such as
telecoms company Telkom, Koseff says: "We will bid for the work jointly with
overseas partners. Telkom will need both local and international assistance."

<P> Alliances &#173; either long-lasting or temporary &#173; seem to be the
strategy favoured by both local and foreign players, particularly in
privatization, but they have also stretched to such areas as asset management.
The most significant tie-up has been NatWest's with Cape Town-based Board of
Executors, renamed BOE NatWest. BOE was an independent company involved in
private and merchant banking. It has R11.4 billion in assets under management and
has brokered some major corporate deals in recent years.

<P> While this is a relatively formal arrangement, several one-off associations
have also been established. Recently Hambros worked closely with Rand Merchant
Bank in structuring a R200 million Eurobond for the World Bank.

<P> <B>Foreign alliances</B>

<P> Cooperation has been stimulated by two things. First, the easing of exchange
controls on South African residents has enabled asset managers to undertake swaps
of locally owned assets for foreign ones. Second, the deregulation of the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange has allowed banks to act as brokers. Rather than set
up their own brokerage departments, most have formed partnerships or taken over
local stockbrokers. Other South African stockbrokers have formed foreign
alliances to strengthen their positions and also to allow them to move into
non-traditional areas, such as investment banking.

<P> There has also been cooperation with overseas operators in asset management.
Some of the more significant partnerships are Capital Alliance with SBC Warburg;
Fedsure Asset Management with Liechtenstein Global Trust; Liberty Asset
Management with Union Bank of Switzerland; RMB Asset Management with Morgan
Grenfell Asset Management; Sanlam, the second biggest life assurer, with Capital
Alliance; and Standard Bank with Fidelity International. The relationships vary:
some are advisory and some cover only research; others extend to marketing each
other's services and products.

<P> Apart from privatization and trade finance, another major slice of business
is the unbundling of some of South Africa's corporates, particularly sell-offs to
black economic empowerment groupings. Important deals have included selling off
life assurance companies and the Afrikaans-language newspaper group Perskor to
black interest groups. One of the largest deals currently involves the Johnnic
subsidiary of South Africa's largest corporate, Anglo American.

<P> However, it is not only the need to give blacks a greater stake in the
economy that is stimulating the unbundling of South Africa's complex holdings but
also the wider need for investment, both inward and outward. Barnes says: "I
think unbundling will expand, given the concentration of shareholdings and the
diversity of potential interest in our stock market. Market forces and regulation
will force the pace, but it will not be an overnight process."

<P> However, he does not see foreign corporates raiding South African soil: "To
get control of anything in this country is a significant undertaking." But, as
Koseff says, as other companies unbundle to realize their full value "there will
be pretty nice pieces of corporate South Africa that foreign companies will want
to own".

<P> Koseff says international players have some advantages over local banks. They
can provide a cheaper source of funding because of lower risk premiums and they
have global networks for distribution of products, closer access to technology
and a larger pool of high-calibre staff. South African banks have to compete on
those fronts by ensuring that they employ the highest-quality staff and make use
of their local knowledge and niche strategy to protect their turf.

<P> It is not clear whether further mergers of local banks can be expected in
order to provide the muscle needed to become significant players. But a shake-out
is expected among foreign banks operating in South Africa. Geeringh expects their
numbers to dwindle when they discover that it is not that easy to displace local
players. Barnes adds that  there is not sufficient depth of business for all the
foreign banks to make a living. On top of this, margins have fallen drastically
in both trade finance and capital funding, with margins as narrow as 30 to 50
basis points above Libor.

<P> South African banks have the additional advantage of holding proportionately
much more South African risk on their balance sheets than foreign banks do.
Although foreign banks came in with a wide range of instruments, up-to-date
technology has provided South African banks with the ability to keep pace. Barnes
sums up the position: "We have the client base and we intend to be around for
ever."


<P>

<H2> <B>Set the rand free</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>South Africa has an uphill task
recovering from apartheid. It isn't helped by the fact that the rand has
plummeted this year. An influx of foreign investors searching for new
opportunities has added another bucketful of volatility to an already heady mix.
Eager to maintain stability the government is hesitant about removing the last
layer of exchange controls but investment experts believe they should be dropped
at once</B> </H4> 

<P> The South African rand has taken a pounding this year,
dropping in value by 25% in the first two quarters. As if all the other problems
the new South Africa has to face were not enough of a deterrent, currency risk
has now jumped high up the list of fundamental issues frightening away urgently
needed foreign investment.

<P> The other problems include a high government deficit level (5.8% of GDP),
foreign reserves that have at times been sufficient to cover only six weeks'
imports, the maintenance of foreign exchange controls, low labour productivity,
high trade barriers and uncompetitive industry.

<P> These problems are nearly all a direct consequence of the isolation of the
apartheid era, not of current government policies. South Africa is slowly
emerging from a siege economy forced upon it by years of international isolation.
After four years of negative economic growth at the tail end of the apartheid
era, when trade and financial sanctions bit deep, the economy has turned around.
This has at least enabled the government to start introducing structural changes.

<P> It has moved fairly quickly over a wide front to reverse the backward
economic slide of the 1980s and early 1990s, in the process often jettisoning
ideologies that had been held dear by the ruling African National Congress (ANC)
during the years of struggle.

<P> The country is "at least on the right track", says Roy McAlpine, chairman of
the asset management arm of South Africa's biggest proprietary life assurer,
Liberty Life, which also has a substantial international position, particularly
in the UK. But he adds that it will take a year or two before there can be
certainty about whether targets can be achieved and before the country can claim
to be well down the path towards a soundly based economy.

<P> Achieving a stable rand first required a stable political and economic
policy. The question asked by international investors was whether the ANC would
do more to meet the expectations of its constituency with populist policies or
whether it would "hold its ground".

<P> Earlier this year the government released details of its macroeconomic
strategy, dubbed growth, employment and redistribution (Gear), aimed at
sustainable, high-level economic growth. However, some of the reforms it is
implementing are making its task more difficult and putting added pressure on the
rand.

<P> For example, because of its comparatively small manufacturing base, South
Africa moves into trouble fairly quickly on the balance of payments current
account whenever there is an upturn in the economy, because of a boom in import
demand, particularly for heavy equipment. In the apartheid era this resulted in
short boom-and-bust cycles. However, in the latest phase of growth following last
year's general elections the pressure on the current account was initially more
than compensated for by massive inflows on the capital account. McAlpine argues
that South Africa cannot run large deficits on the balance-of-payments current
account while counting on short-term capital inflows to stabilize the value of
the rand.

<P> Dave Mohr, chief economist of Old Mutual, South Africa's largest life
assurer, says the value of the rand will ultimately depend on the economic growth
record. "A lot of things have to come together, but the key focus area is
government spending," he says. He believes that if the government's macroeconomic
strategy is implemented "we have got a good chance", and that although there will
not be 100% delivery of the targets, the country should be able to get most of
the way. "It is the only way we will get sustainable growth over the next 10 to
15 years."

<P> All the elements of the plan have to be implemented, says Mohr. For example,
there has been economic growth but little job creation. In the interests of
social stability, job-creation recommendations have to be implemented quickly.
And there will be keen concern that the government can deliver on social services
while maintaining fiscal discipline and keeping tax rates under control.

<P> To achieve the Gear targets the government will have to act more quickly and
make bolder decisions, says Stephen Koseff, chief executive of Investec Bank. He
cites an example on the social services front, where provision of housing is
being held up by bureaucracy. The money is there but delivery is not taking
place.

<P> A great deal of effort will have to be put into developing exports other than
primary commodities, particularly non-traditional manufactured exports, which
account for only 10% of exports. "If South Africa can get competitive in
manufactured exports we can feel more relaxed," says Mohr.

<P> <B>Privatization can't wait</B>

<P> The government should also have moved two years ago on privatization, says
Koseff, "but it is still dawdling. By the time it moves decisively it could be
too late, because the competition for foreign capital is increasing as countries
around the world go down the privatization route". McAlpine agrees, arguing that
privatization could halt the current depreciation of the rand by bringing in
foreign capital. "We need to take brave steps on issues such as privatization. It
is still an emotional issue. We have already done a 180-degree turn on the issue,
with the ANC distancing itself from its original policy of nationalization. Now
we have to turn the other 180 degrees and privatize."

<P> Since the end of apartheid foreign investment in both the bond and equity
markets has soared. Outsiders are looking for emerging-market-style opportunities
in an economy that, in fits and starts, is attempting to join the global
mainstream. And South Africa now faces the twitchiness of foreign investors who
often damn the government if it does, and damn it if it doesn't.

<P> The volatility of the markets and the rand has been aggravated by investors
leaping in and out, often on what the government is starting to suspect are
orchestrated rumours &#173; ranging from stories about the resignation of Reserve
Bank governor Chris Stals to hints that president Nelson Mandela is in poor
health.

<P> There are difficulties enough that are not based on rumour. If something is
not done soon to halt the depreciation of the rand, South Africa could be on a
spiral of high interest rates, high inflation, higher demands from organized
labour, and further depreciation of the rand. The drop in the value of the rand
has halted the government's efforts to make it fully convertible and has already
knocked at least 1% off expected economic growth this year.

<P> The rand's difficulties spring essentially from perceptions of the political
future of the country and concerns over whether necessary structural changes can
be successfully implemented. With pressure on the rand continuing, the government
has had to weigh the effects of pushing real interest rates, already above 10%,
to new highs &#173; with consequent effect on economic growth and the
government's ability to meet the needs of a population that is mostly deprived of
the full range of social services.

<P> When it came to power, the government moved quickly to make the rand fully
convertible, its single most important measure being the scrapping of the dual
currency system. This had been created in 1986 with the introduction of the
financial rand which sought with a debt standstill to ward off the worst effects
of financial sanctions. These began when Chase Manhattan refused to roll over
short-term loans to the government.

<P> The financial rand (finrand) was a defined pool of money. The currency traded
at a discount to the commercial rand varying from 8% to as high as 50% depending
on the degree of foreign confidence. Because the finrand was sanitized out of the
system there was little effect on reserves and on the commercial rand, which was
used for trade transactions.

<P> The commercial rand's value moved (consistently downwards) on the
differential between South Africa's inflation rate and an inflation rate based on
a basket of currencies of the country's main trading partners. On March 10 last
year the finrand was abolished. The previous day it had been trading at a
discount of 2.55% to the commercial rand, which was priced at R3.65 to the
dollar. The following day the commercial rand shrugged off any effects of the
change,  maintaining the same trading range.

<P> <B>A rougher ride</B>

<P> Old Mutual's Mohr says that in retrospect it is clear the finrand was
hopelessly undervalued. It was, he says, essentially a shock absorber:
"Previously we were protected [by the finrand]. Now we feel it directly when
capital comes and goes."

<P> And South Africa certainly has felt it over the past six months, as the value
of the unified currency has taken knock after knock. Just when everyone believes
it cannot drop any further, down it goes again.

<P> However, at the beginning of the year central bank governor Stals had
considered the rand &#173; then trading at R3.64 to the dollar &#173; overvalued;
it gave the government excess liquidity problems as enormous amounts of
short-term foreign capital poured into the bond and equity markets.

<P> But at times the correction looked more like a meltdown as the currency lost
about 25% of its value in the first significant slide. Mohr says the government's
difficulty in controlling the volatility of the currency has been exacerbated by
the recent development of a Eurorand market: "Much the same happened in the US
when the Federal Reserve  had the control of the dollar taken away from it
because of the development of the Eurodollar market."

<P> And with the scrapping of the financial rand all controls over foreigners
investing and moving both capital and earnings in and out of the economy were
removed. "They can come and go as they like," says Mohr.

<P> But as well as adding volatility to the market, foreign investors are now
demanding that exchange controls on South African residents are phased out,
although the government's efforts to achieve this have been slowed by the run on
the rand. While these controls are in place, it will be impossible to establish
the true value of the rand. As a result, the signal being given by foreign
investors to the government and local institutions is that they are still jittery
about investing in South Africa.

<P> The government has so far taken a salami-slice approach to lifting exchange
controls on residents. Until July last year South African residents were almost
totally barred from making foreign investments. Companies wishing to invest
abroad had to make individual applications that were granted or refused on the
whim of officialdom and according to the current state of reserves. But how
effective the controls have been over the years is open to question; it's
estimated that at least R30 billion is held offshore illegally by South African
residents.

<P> Both the government and the South African Reserve Bank are understandably
jittery about going for the big-bang approach and scrapping all remaining
controls overnight &#173; a measure favoured by many of the country's top
financiers. Investec's Koseff is one who favours waiting no longer. He argues:
"Exchange controls limit rather than protect capital. The sooner we operate on a
level playing field the better for the long-term health of the economy. At some
point in time we are going to have to take the punishment that will go with it."

<P> Koseff makes a comparison with east European countries such as Poland, which
grasped the nettle, scrapped all exchange controls and have now come through the
dip. McAlpine of Liberty Life says the government missed a window of opportunity
by not scrapping all exchange controls when it abolished the financial rand.
"Right now we have the worst of all worlds. The rand has fallen out of bed, and
we still have exchange controls."

<P> Roddy Sparks, Old Mutual assistant general manager investments, says
scrapping exchange controls could cause "initial indigestion for three to six
months", but argues that logic is often defied by what happens in practice and
the process could be smoother than expected.

<P> Those arguing for the big-bang approach say there is hardly likely to be a
major withdrawal from local equity and bond markets, because of the detrimental
effect this would have on remaining assets, although there is pent-up local
demand for offshore diversification, particularly among asset managers. Mohr says
it is a strange situation for controls to remain on local individuals and
institutions when a sophisticated market in the rand has developed
internationally.

<P> <B>Asset-swap investment</B>

<P> The noose on individuals and institutions has, however, been gradually
loosened. South African corporates are being given greater leeway to invest
abroad, although most of these investments, particularly in Europe and the US,
have been effected by leveraging funds offshore. The government has been
particularly keen to encourage South African companies to expand into
neighbouring countries in an attempt to develop the regional economy. Investing
in Africa is now almost a formality when it comes to exchange control approval.

<P> The most significant change for individuals, however, was the introduction in
July last year of the asset swap concept. This permitted retail products that
incorporate rand foreign investments. This concept has been much criticized
because it is bureaucratically unwieldy, with each transaction requiring official
permission. And the technique has been restricted to life assurance companies,
unit trust companies and retirement funds.

<P> Local savings and investment institutions are allowed to swap locally held
assets (equities or bonds) for assets (including cash) offshore. This is
conditional, however, on the institutions being limited to arranging swaps to a
maximum of 5% of assets under management; they also have to give assurances that
if foreign holders of the South African assets want to dump their investments
back in South Africa the foreign holdings will be repatriated.

<P> Sparks, who organizes the Old Mutual asset swaps, says that however
unsatisfactory the mechanism, institutions have felt impelled to get involved.
"If we didn't do it we knew our competitors would."

<P> Other players, such as Investec, advance with caution on asset swaps, because
investment houses are at a disadvantage to insurance companies. The latter,
according to current regulations, are able to structure retail products not
available to others.

<P> Koseff says that the swaps are being effected at a discount because of the
costs and liquidity concerns, if for no other reason. He believes that if direct
investments were possible the discount would narrow. The Reserve Bank, though,
insists that there should be no discount for foreign investors; Sparks says there
are in practice no discounts apart from the costs.

<P> Sparks believes that international diversification is sensible, even under
the restrictions and disadvantages of the asset swap regime. But, in his opinion,
there are levels below which local institutions would not be prepared to deal.
"There is some sort of self-correcting level," he says.

<P> Sparks adds that the gradualist approach has helped to build up local
knowledge of international markets and allowed local financial institutions to
make considered decisions about offshore investments. Some of the institutions,
such as Old Mutual, already had a solid foothold offshore, running successful
fund management operations. Others, however, had concluded strategic
relationships, and some had been taken over by foreign institutions. Only major
players such as Old Mutual would be able to operate offshore without alliances.
"It needs time, patience, a brand name and critical mass to be able to remain
independent," comments Sparks.

<P> He says that those institutions carrying out swaps are playing it close to
their chest, releasing little detail beyond their value. Sparks predicts that
when exchange controls go and individuals are allowed to make direct foreign
currency investments offshore, local institutions will face a lot more
competition. This will particularly affect the savings/investment industry.

<P> The asset swap arrangement has revealed extensive evidence of public demand
for investment abroad. Life assurance companies have developed endowment
(investment) products with the funds fully invested offshore, and the mutual fund
industry is marketing "global funds" that are partly invested abroad.
Individuals, however, can make rand investments only in the products of the
institution making the foreign currency arrangement; the retail products can be
traded only within South Africa.

<P> Sparks estimates that at the moment only about 2% to 3% of assets of the
approximate R700 billion under management in the savings and investment sector
have been placed offshore through assets swaps. But in an environment free of
exchange controls, South African asset managers could be expected to move between
15% and 20% of managed assets into offshore investments.

<P> <B>Demand if the price is right</B>

<P> Sparks expects the volume of asset swaps to increase as more local
institutions establish relationships with foreign institutions and also because
the local equity market is currently flat compared with offshore markets. Sparks
would like to see exchange controls finally phased out within two years.

<P> Further exchange control relaxations were announced under the Gear economic
programme. Among other things, asset swap limits were extended to 10% of assets
under management. For the first time this included a cashflow amount equal to 3%
of cashflow of the previous year, unlinked to asset swaps but included in the
limit of 10% of total assets under management.

<P> No-one knows how individuals will behave when exchange controls finally go,
but it is generally expected that, as with institutions, there will be a level at
which they will not be prepared to buy assets offshore. If the rand takes a
pounding, individuals will not be prepared to take a perceived depreciation of
their savings.

<P> There is a pent-up demand for foreign investment which, says Mohr, will be a
key factor in setting the true value of the rand. Apart from this potential
demand, there is also currently a R14 billion overhang in the spot market as a
result of forward buying by the central bank in an attempt to smooth the passage
of the rand through its recent phase of volatility.

<P> A persistent hope is that South Africa could prove the springboard for
economic revival in sub-Saharan Africa; some have even predicted that in the
short term the Southern African region could soon form a single trading bloc,
with a single currency &#173; the rand.

<P> But until its reform programme really gets going, South Africa will have to
continue to live with a volatile currency and hope that other fundamentals such
as continued solid profit growth of South African companies and high interest
rates will cancel out the currency risk perceived by foreign investors.

<B>What future for London?</B>
</H2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<font size=3>
London's future as a financial centre is not threatened by the Labour Party, European economic and monetary union or the pusillanimity of the London Stock Exchange board. But it will certainly be affected by all these things. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Labour Party (which, polls suggest, will win the next general election due by May 1997) has plans to improve financial regulation. It also wants to stretch - by legislation, codes of practice or example - the time-horizon of investors and the end-users of capital.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Labour leadership says this is a question of culture: investors and companies are already adjusting their views on short-termism and corporate governance, in reaction to the 1980s. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Labour's plans for financial supervision are worrying. Although Labour policy-makers insist they won't spoil the party, behind the scenes they are pressing for features that would distinguish their reforms from what the Tories might do. No-one denies that London financial regulation needs a face-lift, and Labour at the moment sounds like a party the City can do business with. But some doubters predict that, after an election victory, a few socialist hobby-horses will be hauled back out of the toy-cupboard (see article beginning on page 62).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Britain under Labour is also more likely to sign up for European monetary union (Emu), although the party says it intends to reassure itself (thanks to the opt-out negotiated at Maastricht) that the benefits will outweigh the costs. Will London as a financial centre be better off in or out of Emu? The debate is raging. One eminent bank chairman has argued that, while Emu could make the UK uncompetitive, there is little or no chance of Frankfurt or Paris usurping London's role as the financial centre of Europe, so why risk the dangers of fiscal harmonization with the EU hard core. Others argue that the only way to dominate the <I>Euro</I> securities market - which London is perfectly equipped to do - is to be in at the beginning. But is keeping <I>Finanzplatz</I> London ahead of the game a good enough reason for ignoring the cost/benefit effects on the whole country?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While London as an offshore centre looks set to thrive, there is something rotten at its heart - the London Stock Exchange. A battle against vested interests and Luddism has cost its last two chief executives their jobs (see the article on the dismissal of Michael Lawrence beginning on page 24). His predecessor Peter Rawlins resigned after the Taurus fiasco, an attempt to placate every possible selfish interest, apart from that of creating an effective settlement system. The Lawrence d&eacute;bacle has again lost London time, money and prestige in the battle for international trading volume. A handful of pre-eminent investment banks - so innovative and flexible when it comes to working with other people's regulations - apparently, when regulating themselves, can't be relied on to put the interests of the marketplace before their own. That's a pretty short-sighted view. And the Labour Party, which already has a jaundiced view of self-regulation, will take note.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Labour wants to fold the self-regulatory organizations into the Securities &amp; Investments Board, yet to keep practitioners involved. It has talked about taking bank supervision out of the Bank England, and then said this is only one of many possibilities. Its latest utterances have been so conciliatory as to be almost incredible. No, the City is told, Labour no longer has plans for a compulsory levy on companies to pay for training. Perhaps, with a little more persuasion, it will also drop plans for a windfall tax on privatized utilities.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The "stakeholder society" trumpeted by Labour leader Tony Blair during a visit to Singapore in January seems a less frightening concept than alarmists first feared. It means simply encouraging awareness that a company has responsibilities to a group wider than just its shareholders - to its employees, suppliers, customers and maybe its creditors too. Nothing wrong with that. (Shareholders of investment banks have long wondered who comes first in the pecking order.) But since the stakeholder concept appears to be little more than a cultural preference, we are again left wondering how Labour will make its mark during its first term of office since 1979. Fiscal experts suggest that the next government will inherit a level of taxation which is the lowest in Europe, lower than Greece. Without raising taxation or radically cutting expenditure Labour will have little room for manoeuvre, and there is no sign that it is preparing for such shocks.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It seems that, for a while, Labour's policies, especially on financial regulation, are malleable. Now is the time for interested parties to talk to the Labour Party about the future of London. The last regulatory changes to London were done with conviction. This may have been flawed, but at least the reforms displayed a vision. Civil servants remember how Norman Tebbit, then trade and industry minister, pushed through the Financial Services Act with enormous self-confidence about the marketplace that he was creating. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now the financial industry is alone. There is no Labour vision - bad or good - about financial system reform. It's up to us to fill this vacuum before it becomes cluttered with half-baked ideas.

<H2>Flemings recruits head of European capital markets </H2>
FLEMINGS has appointed Michael Hammond to be head of European equity capital
markets in an effort to broaden its equity and equity-related new issue
business in Europe. <BR>
<BR>
Hammond, who was previously head of equity syndicate at SBC Warburg, will
fill a new post and report to James Bruce, head of global capital markets
at Flemings, and Ian Hannam, head of equity syndicate. <BR>
<BR>
He will operate alongside Russell Julius, who recently joined the firm in
Hong Kong from Barings as head of Asian capital markets, and Colin Hermon,
the former Asian capital markets head who is returning to London to take
charge of Japanese and Indian business. <BR>
<BR>
Bruce said Hammond's recruitment marked an attempt to build a primary market
presence that was in line with Flemings' growing secondary market business.
<BR>
<BR>
Under securities head Tom Hughes-Hallett, Flemings' European equities division
has grown to comprise some 50 analysts and 60 salesmen covering around 640
European stocks. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now is the time to have a push on the primary side,&quot; said Bruce,
adding that Hammond's focus would be equally on emerging market countries
in eastern Europe and developed European economies. <BR>
<BR>
While Flemings has a leading position in the Asian equity and equity-linked
new issue market, the firm has a relatively thin presence in the European
primary market. But the bank is leading a large IPO for Sun Life &amp; Provincial
Holdings and is clearly keen to expand its primary market operation. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;As in Asia, we are not expecting the world overnight,&quot; said Bruce.
&quot;We will focus on equity and equity-linked deals and concentrate on
the mid-sized transactions to begin with. We probably won't aspire to the
really big stuff until a bit later on.&quot; <HR><BR>
<B>Salomon Brothers</B> has recruited Timothy Horlick to be chief operating
officer of European investment banking, reporting to David Jarvis, head
of European investment banking. <BR>
<BR>
Horlick was previously co-head of global equity capital markets at Dresdner-Kleinwort
Benson and from 1998 to 1992 was a member of Kleinwort Benson's corporate
finance group. Before that he was with Price Waterhouse from 1983. <BR>
<BR>
Market speculation this week suggested that other Kleinwort staff might
be following Horlick to Salomon -- which also recently hired two of the
UK firm's equity syndicate team as part of its equity efforts. But this
could not be confirmed. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Lehman Brothers</B> has named Glauco Cerri as managing director and sales
manager for its European credit business, reporting to John McDonald, managing
director and head of fixed-income sales for Europe. <BR>
<BR>
From 1993 Cerri was managing director, head of European fixed-income sales
and a member of the global fixed-income operating committee. <BR>
<BR>
Before that, he spent three years in Milan as head of First Boston's Italian
subsidiary after being a director responsible for fixed-income sales to
investors in Italy, Spain and Portugal. <BR>
<BR>
McDonald said: &quot;Glauco's many years of experience in fixed income and
proven managerial skills will make him an ideal member of Lehman Brothers'
senior management team in Europe.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Hansjorg Patzschke, head of DM syndicate at JP Morgan in Frankfurt, is rejoining
<B>Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts et Consignations</B> in Frankfurt to become
responsible for the firm's non-government trading activities. He will report
to Martin Bouffard in Frankfurt and Eric Dumas in Paris. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Paribas Capital Markets </B>and <B>BBA Creditanstalt</B> have appointed
Sergio Goldman as head of their joint equity research venture in Brazil.
<BR>
<BR>
Goldman will report to Luis Phillips, Paribas' head of Latin American research
in New York, for products, and geographically to Candido Bracher, managing
director of Banco BBA Creditanstalt in S&atilde;o Paulo. <BR>
<BR>
Previously Goldman was managing director of Brazilian equity research for
two years at Bear Stearns and before that was research director for Baring
Securities do Brasil for two years. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Alfred Berg Holding AB</B>, the Swedish investment bank owned by ABN
AMRO, has selected Harry Klagsbrun to succeed Carl-Diedric Hamilton as chief
executive officer from July 1. <BR>
<BR>
Klagsbrun joined the firm in 1995 and is deputy managing director and head
of the firm's corporate finance activities. <BR>
<BR>
Before that he was head of corporate finance at Svenska Handelsbanken in
Stockholm from 1990 to 1995. From 1982 to 1989 he was managing director
of corporate finance at Smith Barney. <BR>
<BR>
Also from July 1, Carl-Diedric Hamilton will become chairman of the board.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Banque Paribas</B> has recruited David Cottam to its media and telecommunications
finance team in London. <BR>
<BR>
Cottam was previously with Chase Manhattan Bank, covering media and telecommunications
for the UK and continental Europe and before that worked in the civil engineering
sector for 10 years. <BR>
<BR>
<B>WestLB UK Ltd</B> has appointed Jonathan Jamilly as director and head
of loan syndication for UK risks, responsible for WestLB's secondary market
activities including credit derivatives. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Exchange Clearing House (ECHO)</B> has appointed Philip Lynch as chief
executive. <BR>
<BR>
Lynch joined Lehman Brothers in New York in 1971, where he held various
management positions. In 1977 he became branch manager, commodity administrative
director in London and then a managing director. <BR>
<BR>
Separately, Jean-Daniel de Jonge (previously marketing director for SWIFT
in Brussels) has been appointed marketing director. <BR>
<BR>
With over 20 years' experience in the securities markets, Bradley Rood has
established an executive search consultancy, <B>Jared James Associates Ltd.
</B>The team of consultants comprises Bradley Rood, Andrew Pye, Nerys Hilton-Jones
and Anthony Meah. <BR>
<BR>
Andrew Harrington, the top-ranking telecoms analyst, has switched to <B>Salomon
Brothers</B> in London from the bank's Hong Kong office. <BR>
<BR>
Together with Douglas Wight, Harrington will cover the European telecoms
sector. Both report to Albert Richards, head of equity research. <BR>
<BR>
Ralf Hohwieler has been appointed as senior manager, structured finance
and loans syndication, within the London-based team of <B>Royal Bank of
Canada Europe</B>. He was prevously with the bank's Frankfurt office. <BR>
<BR>
Hohwieler's primary role will be to develop German and central European
structured lending as part of the bank's aim to be a leading North American
bank in central Europe. <BR>
<BR>
Jean-Maurice Elkouby also joins the team lead by Luc d'Iorio as syndication
manager. <HR>
<H3>PEOPLE </H3>
<H2>Whelan joins NatWest to lead global equities drive </H2>

<BR>
Whelan was previously global head of risk management and a member of Morgan
Stanley's operating committee. <BR>
<BR>
He joined Morgan Stanley in 1985 to establish its international equity derivatives
business, in 1990 was given executive responsibility for global equity derivatives
and in 1993 also became responsible for the firm's North American equities

Whelan said he had decided to join NatWest because he had been &quot;impressed
by their clear commitment to becoming a major global investment banks and
the investment that they are putting into achieving that goal.&quot;

<H3>DIARY OF AN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT BANKER</H3>
 <B> Ian Kerr </B><BR>
<H2>The last privatization supper</H2>
<H4>
Jean-Claude Komarovsky resists the temptation to retrieve some of the family
silver from the Russians. Especially while there are plenty of Americans
willing to get their fingers burnt. </H4>
At a fairly select dinner party last week, a senior French banker pronounced:
&quot;Privatization is like castration, it works better on dogs.&quot; You
could have heard a pin drop. A delightful Austrian lady asked me whether
the Frenchie didn't like animals. I quickly explained that in this instance
&quot;dogs&quot; probably referred to state assets which no sensible person
would want to touch unless wearing surgical gloves. <BR>
<BR>
<B>O</B>f course the Komarovskys, like other once proud families, have been
experts on privatizations since the beginning of 1944, except that our experience
was in reverse privatizations - the invading Russians taking all the family
assets into their private possession in exchange for one bottle of vodka
and a zero-coupon perpetual rouble IOU. &quot;Now is your chance to take
back great chunks of Mother Russia for Black Knight Bank and yourself,&quot;
says the Austrian lady's husband. I tell him that if he is gung-ho on the
Russians he should speak to Hans-J&ouml;rg Rudloff at MC Securities or Ian
Molson at CS First Boston who desperately need someone to share their increasingly
isolated confidence. <BR>
<BR>
As the ladies retire I congratulate the French banker on his &quot;dogs&quot;
philosophy. To be honest, the French state has very little to sell which
isn't a waterlogged hound so it is difficult for them to be selective. Of
course the British set the real privatization ball rolling with the all-conquering
Margaret Thatcher playing striker, sweeper, full-back and referee. With
her &quot;get filthy rich as quickly as you can&quot; message, the early
UK privatizations were nearly a licence to steal. Who can remember Kleinwort
Benson's triumphant offering in November 1984 of 50.2% of British Telecom?
At the time it was the largest issue of shares the world had ever seen,
raising just under &#163;4 billion. There was that unforgettable photograph
of Sir George Jefferson (then BT's chairman), David Clementi, Sir Martin
Jacomb and Milord Johnny Rockley trying to look composed in a gale-force
wind and the three Kleinworters privately saying to each other: &quot;I
wish I had used some of George's hair gel&quot;. Poor Kleinwort. The first
BT issue was the bank's crowning glory for many years. After that the only
talk of Kleinwort on the cocktail party circuit was of video-taped canoodling
on the trading-room floor and Charlie Hue-Williams' momentary lapse of concentration
when he bought a monster block of Premier shares thinking he had sold them.
Little Kleinwort became a party wallflower. Nice fat-cat clients like BT
did a runner. Only some magic and much determination from Simon Robertson
and friends saved Kleinwort's face and allowed KB shareholders to divvy
up &#163;1 billion of Dresdner Bank's money between them. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why has privatization recently gone sourer than the demeanour of a
Goldman Sachs partner who has just seen a juicy mandate fly out of the window?&quot;
asks an Italian banker. These pasta-munchers are so smooth. &quot;Your lot
haven't helped,&quot; comments the Englishman. I make an effort to defuse
a possible confrontation. &quot;Enel and Stet are surely crown jewels in
their own right which couldn't be swapped for even the best <I>bolito misto</I>
in Rome,&quot; I say. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Up your Omsk,&quot; cries our token Russian, Sergei Molotov, one of
the dinner guests whose grandpappy was either politically related or who
invented the famous cocktail. But perhaps the fiery Sergei has a point.
The financially potless Russkies were recently trying to complete one of
their own privatizations and unload a whole cluster of dodgy telephone companies
onto the charming Italians at Stet who had either been out in the sun too
long or had enjoyed a lunch fortified by buckets of grappa. With Stet itself
about to be privatized wasn't this just the perfect time for the Russkies
to dump 25% of the otherwise nearly unsaleable Svyazinvest quietly on Stet's
gullible prospective international investors where BZW had been suckered
into leading the books? Somewhere down the line the Italians saw the light
and abandoned ship by suggesting that Stet place most of the purchase price
in a separate escrow account until Svyazinvest proved it owned at least
one telephone line. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Seems fair to me,&quot; I said but Sergei Molotov cried: &quot;Off
with their one-piece blinis and a curse on all Imperialists.&quot; The crazed
fellow then started to throw fine Stewart crystal into the fireplace sobbing:
&quot;But we needed Stet to sign off on the deal by December 23 in order
that all of the Svyazinvest senior executives could receive a new BMW 850
each and to bank their cash cut in the usual customer-friendly Grand Cayman
account.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The other guests and myself raise our glasses in sympathy to substantial
lost fees for NM Rothschild and others who represented the irksome Russkies.
I think of proposing that we send each Svyazinvest senior official a nice
new Lada but common sense prevails. <BR>
<BR>
<B>W</B>hy has privatization suddenly become so less glamorous as well as
less profitable? A kilted guest, Torquil McScone of the Edinburgh Garden
Hedge Fund, attempts to explain: &quot;It was fine while governments selected
their own best lead-manager. But as soon as the Yanks came in and started
telling the former laundry-wallahs and rickshaw drivers who had later become
finance ministers that one rupee or one ringgit could actually be a dollar
and fifty cents, the shoot began to hit the fan.&quot; Everyone around the
table applauds McScone and agrees that the US investment banks are pushy,
greedy and almost invariably uncouth but wouldn't we all love their bonuses?
For some reason the laundry-wallahs who became finance ministers are impressed
with the Yanks' &quot;roll you right over on your back&quot; approach in
beauty parades. Just look at Sing Tel, PT Tel and Deutsche Tel to name but
a few. When the Greek OTE shows its face on the road again you can bet your
sweet bippy that one of the bulge-bracket Americans will have persuaded
the ouzo-quaffers that the deal won't fly unless it's sold into retail in
Spokane, Syracuse and South Bend. Also, as the Americans are inveterate
liars and have such improbable family backgrounds they will also claim to
have descendants in Piraeus and to have hobnobbed with Ari and Jackie aboard
the <I>Christina</I> in days gone by. <BR>
<BR>
I ask McScone whether the main fund managers are changing their attitude
towards privatization issues. &quot;Let me tell you laddie,&quot; he begins,
&quot;that where we once bought every share in sight, we now short them
until we can hear the pips squeak.&quot; The English banker suggests that
the main problem with the privatization programmes of the next two years
is the huge overweighting in the telecoms and electricity sectors. &quot;You've
got it in one, laddie,&quot; cries McScone. &quot;Very soon one of the big
banana republic state telephone companies will contact Rothschilds or Morgan
Stanley to say that they have the deal of the century to propose. However,
the response from Rothschild and Stanley will be: &quot;Don't call us, we'll
call you.&quot; <p>

<H3>EMERGING MARKETS</H3>   
<H2>Brazil </H2>
<H4>Plugging banking's black holes </H4>
<b>Edited by Brian Caplen</B> <BR><BR>
These are tempestuous times for Brazil's banking system. Over the past few
months, the government has agreed an $8 billion rescue package for one institution
and a $7.5 billion bail-out for another, while a yawning hole the size of
several Barings/Daiwa scandals mysteriously surfaced where the assets of
a third bank ought to have been. <BR>
<BR>
These are the latest and most dramatic cases in a series of banking catastrophes
that have seen at least five of the country's top banks run into serious
trouble and 100 financial institutions placed under central bank administration
since mid-1994. And yet most analysts still maintain the banking system
as a whole remains fairly solid. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think there is no risk of a crisis of the system,&quot; says Paulo
Miguel, international analyst with Banco Inter-Atlantico, a private Brazilian
investment bank. &quot;The huge retail banks such as Bradesco, Real, Unibanco
and Itau have a very solid position and a good balance-sheet structure,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
But, virtually in the same breath, Miguel speaks disparagingly of the appalling
quality of banking supervision that failed to detect $5.6 billion-worth
of forged assets on the books of the collapsed Banco Nacional, once Brazil's
seventh largest private bank. That fraud, which appears to have been perpetrated
over 10 years in order to maintain balance-sheet equilibrium, was uncovered
only in February, thanks to the probing of journalists working for the local
<I>Veja</I> magazine. <BR>
<BR>
Miguel blames the central bank for not finding out before it approved Nacional's
merger with former rival Unibanco. To add insult to injury, that merger
was supported with a $5 billion credit line from the official Proer financial
restructuring programme. <BR>
<BR>
Adriana Lacombe, a Sao Paulo-based banking analyst with ING Barings, agrees
that supervision is lax. &quot;The credibility of the Brazilian banking
system has been hurt,&quot; she says in a report. &quot;It remains to be
explained how neither the central bank nor the auditors realized that one-third
of Nacional assets never existed.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This is not the only example that concerns Lacombe. How, she asks, has Sao
Paulo state bank Banespa managed to avoid publishing financial statements
since November 1994, even though it is traded on the stock exchange? Who
is protecting the interests of minority shareholders? <BR>
<BR>
Lacombe also wonders how Banco do Brasil, the government-controlled bank
that recently reported 1995 losses of $4.2 billion, can get away with accounting
for the Brazilian sovereign debt held by its foreign branches at face value
when the market value is only 50%. <BR>
<BR>
Both Banespa and Banco do Brasil have recently won approval for huge government-led
capital injections. Banespa, like many other Brazilian institutions, had
run into trouble when the easy money it gained through speculation in the
high inflationary days vanished overnight. Its woes were doubled when in
mid-1995 the government - fearing that runaway consumer spending could
revive inflation - pushed up interest rates, forcing many companies
into default. <BR>
<BR>
There was pressure for the government to seize the moment and privatize
Banespa, a bank riddled with inefficiencies and with a history of political
manipulation. But Sao Paulo governor Mario Covas successfully stifled privatization
talk, and instead negotiated a complex restructuring programme with Brasilia.
The federal government will lend the Sao Paulo state $7.5 billion to help
it refinance half its $15 billion debt to Banespa, while the other half
will be paid for by transferring to Banespa's books, airports, railways
and other state assets. <BR>
<BR>
In the case of Banco do Brasil, whose recent $4.2 billion annual loss was
the largest in the country's corporate history, analysts believes the $8
billion rescue package is better conceived. &quot;The treasury said it wouldn't
be a bail-out. It would be a strict underwriting and the private sector
would contribute,&quot; says one Sao Paulo-based economist. &quot;But let's
see how it works out in practice. It's a long process.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The government is to provide $4.9 billion of that capital injection by buying
new shares due to be issued by Banco do Brasil in May. The price of those
shares, which will increase the government's stake from its current 51%,
has not been fixed yet. The rest of the cash is due to come from existing
shareholders, while there are rumours that the national development bank,
BNDES, will put in $1.2 billion. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The solution to the state-owned banks' problems is being addressed
by the central bank without causing any major trauma to the financial system,&quot;
says Lacombe. &quot;But the cost of restructuring is still unknown.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Unknown, too, is precisely how the central bank could have failed to spot
fraud at Banco Nacional. And that mystery may never be fully resolved, because
in March the government successfully headed off opposition demands for an
investigation. But the costs of this could be high. Serious doubts must
remain about the capacity of the central bank to supervise the financial
system. As one analyst asked: &quot;If officials failed to notice a hole
the size of four Barings, what other awful things might be lurking out there?&quot;

<H2>Israel </H2>
<H4>Privatization fails to take off </H4>
When the new Labour-led government took control of Israel's parliament in
June 1992, finance minister Avraham Shochat declared that the government
would reduce its ownership in the economy from 20% to 12%. Although it came
nowhere near hitting that target the government's term is ending on a high
note for the investment community. The recent share offering in London and
Tel Aviv of Israel Discount Bank (IDB), Israel's third largest bank, was
the government's first attempt at selling off a state-owned enterprise on
London's financial markets. <BR>
<BR>
The flotation valued the bank at more than &#163;500 million ($750 million).
The offering was deliberately priced below book value to make sure it succeeded
in tough market conditions. According to David Cohen, a director of Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, one of the investment banks which handled the deal:
&quot;The bank is conservatively financed, so it has immense loan growth
potential.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Gavin Rabinowitz, head of the investment banking division at the London
law firm of Nabarro Nathanson, believes that Israeli banks could represent
fine, long-term investment opportunities because they have large stakes
in many Israeli companies. That potential is attracting the attention of
many fund managers. Michael Power of Baring Asset Management sees Israel
competing for the attention of global fund managers, who are now asking:
&quot;Do I spend on Israel or Indonesia, Turkey, or Poland?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Because of the success of IDB, UK investors will be looking closely at the
next offering, the Bank Mizrachi, which is Israel's fourth largest bank
and said to be worth $750 million. The government intends to sell 25%, bringing
its holding down to 46%. UK-based NatWest Markets has been appointed by
the Israeli government to distribute shares overseas; more than 40% of the
total issue will be distributed to European institutional investors. <BR>
<BR>
Despite the optimism in the UK, however, Israeli analysts are much more
cautious about the country's privatization efforts. Other than IDB the Rabin-Peres
government has privatized very little: a few examples are It Tahal, a water
planning company for $14 million, and Lapidot, an oil exploration firm for
$50 million to Swiss-based millionaire Bruce Rappaport. A few other firms,
such as the retail chain store Shekem, Jerusalem Economic Corporation and
Israel Shipyards were sold - behind closed doors, with no open tenders
- for what many analysts claimed were below-market values. <BR>
<BR>
The most valued asset (and biggest failure) is Israel Chemicals. The original
plan to sell 50% to a strategic investor was scuttled by its management
in favour of selling the major equity portion on public markets and a smaller
stake (15%) to a strategic investor. Of the company's shares 20% have been
sold on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE). The government has pledged to
sell a third of the remaining 80% of the shares for $350 million, although
it still hasn't decided where or when. In February the ministry of finance
cancelled an IPO on the New York stock market, at the last moment, after
it became clear that the market was not prepared to pay the price the treasury
was seeking. <BR>
<BR>
The privatization of El-Al Israel Airlines has never been taken seriously
by the Israeli government, although it has been valued at nearly $800 million.
The company recently decided to delay its Nasdaq offering because of lack
of investor interest. <BR>
<BR>
A similar fate is in prospect for Bezek, the publicly-owned telecommunications
company which sold 25% of its shares on the TASE three years ago. In 1994
the government decided to auction off an additional 25% of Bezek's shares,
and wanted either Southwestern Bell or Northern Telecom to acquire a controlling
interest in the company. After negotiations with these two firms broke off,
an IPO in the US was decided upon. However, in late March, Tamar Ben David,
the head of the Government Companies Authority (the branch of the finance
ministry responsible for privatizing Israeli state-owned firms), put a stop
on all negotiations with the US underwriter, Merrill Lynch, and the adviser
on the sale, Morgan Stanley. Ben David believes it is unlikely that the
sale will be completed this year. <BR>
<BR>
Merrill Lynch wanted to issue Bezek's shares at 25% less than their value
on the TASE. Yitzhak Kaul, Bezek's managing director, points out that the
company was recently awarded a $260 million loan from an international consortium
of banks. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This was nearly double what we originally planned to borrow,&quot;
he says. &quot;The confidence these banks have in Bezek will be reflected
by investors in the company's first international IPO - if and when
that ever happens.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Ben David blames Cable and Wireless for the delay. The British company owns
10.02% of Bezek's shares, and the Israeli government had requested C&amp;W
not to acquire any more which would give it a substantial interest. However,
C&amp;W has not given the Israeli government any such commitment, and company
executives have indicated it may even try to acquire up to 20% of Bezek's
shares. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, is seeking to pass a bill
which would require any company that acquires more than 5% of the stock
of a government-owned enterprise to get permission to do so from the ministry
of finance. The bill would also require any company that owned 5% of the
shares of a state-owned company (as of January 1 1996), to get government
permission to acquire more shares, otherwise it would be forced to sell
these additional holdings<B>.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Many analysts claim that, despite the lip service paid over the years to
the concept, Israel has not done much privatizing. This trend is expected
to continue, because the economy is over-politicized and harbours too many
vested interests .  <B>Joel Bainerman</B> <BR>

<H2>Hong Kong </H2>
<H4>In the image of Fannie Mae </H4>
Hong Kong has upped the ante in its bid to retain the title of Asia's leading
financial centre. In April the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced
the setting up of a mortgage corporation in the mould of Fannie Mae. By
doing so, the colony's <I>de facto</I> central bank is seeking to bring
to life the moribund mortgage-backed securities market and also to enhance
the size and reputation of the local debt markets. <BR>
<BR>
The initiative was sparked in February by the HKMA's consultations with
Fannie Mae on the viability of a Hong Kong equivalent, and the move may
also have a hidden agenda. Two months previously, arch rival Singapore stole
a march on the territory when it became home for the prestigious financial
guarantee company Asian Securitization &amp; Infrastructure Assurance (ASIA).
The Asian Development Bank, a founding shareholder in ASIA, opted for Singapore
ahead of Hong Kong largely because of fears over the latter's stability
following its reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Singapore's charm offensive to woo financial institutions away from
Hong Kong has had considerable success in the past year,&quot; says the
treasurer of one Hong Kong bank. <BR>
<BR>
However, judging by the mixed reaction of many local bankers, the HKMA will
have an uphill struggle selling the concept of a mortgage corporation. &quot;It's
probably good for the market because it should provide a standardized mortgage-backed
security as opposed to the array of disparate instruments that we have seen
to date,&quot; says John Lim, managing director of Asian capital markets
at Chase Manhattan Asia in Hong Kong. &quot;But a lot of local banks are
opposed to the concept. For many, mortgage-related lending is both a core
activity and their most profitable source of earnings. They see no need
for a mortgage corporation of the sort being discussed.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Others were critical of the HKMA's plan to operate the mortgage corporation
as a wholly-owned government subsidiary. &quot;Hong Kong works well as a
financial centre because it lets market forces dictate,&quot; says the director
of retail banking at one local bank. &quot;But the HKMA is creating a false
market, in the sense that banks have no desire to sell on mortgage loans
at present. If it effectively obliges banks to do so in return for a paltry
20 basis points in operating fees, then it's depriving them of income.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The HKMA is quick to counter its critics. &quot;Mortgage lending is the
bread-and-butter business of a lot of banks and they regard it as very profitable
and low risk,&quot; says spokesman Albert Chen. &quot;But there are guidelines
in place which restrict banks' property-related lending to 40% of their
total loan portfolios. And we predict that there will be a shortfall between
future residential mortgage demand and supply that will grow to HK$778 billion
($101 billion) by the year 2005. This means that a point will be reached
where banks that hit the 40% guideline will not be able to go after further
mortgage business. This, in turn, suggests that there is very much a need
in Hong Kong for an intermediate agency.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
His detractors are not persuaded. &quot;First off, there is no reason why
banks which reach the limit cannot securitize their own mortgages for sale
to investors,&quot; says the director of retail banking. &quot;The HKMA
is also off the mark in that it classes all mortgage lending as directly
related to property, whereas in Hong Kong residential mortgages tend to
reflect more an exposure to the economy as a whole and are related to household
income levels. Delinquency rates on such mortgages here have traditionally
been very low, anyway; they were much less than 5% even during the early
1980s property crash.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Capital markets practitioners are much happier with the initiative. &quot;It's
a very welcome move because it should provide another high-quality issuer
in the local Hong Kong dollar bond markets,&quot; says Patrick Thomas, managing
director of Oakreed Financial Services in Hong Kong. &quot;The government's
backing of the corporation will ensure that it has tremendous psychological
support in the market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Philip Li, director of capital markets at the Industrial Bank of Japan,
adds: &quot;The mortgage corporation should go a long way to solving both
the credit enhancement and liquidity problems that the mortgage-backed securities
market has traditionally faced in Hong Kong. It should also enable the many
foreign banks which want to enter the Hong Kong mortgage sector to acquire
high-yield assets without the large operational costs of establishing a
retail business.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
And lest any should worry that Hong Kong's regulators do not have an eye
for the main chance, Chen assures that the proposed mortgage corporation
will be &quot;a very profitable institution&quot;. Capitalized at HK$1 billion
from the colony's Exchange Fund, and incorporated under the Companies Ordinance,
it forecasts a return on equity of 20%, based on the conservative assumption
that the geared-up HK$20 billion mortgage loan portfolio it envisages will
earn a profit margin of 1%. There are also plans to attract private capital
at a later stage, and a listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is being
considered. <B>Tony Shale<BR>

Ghana </H2>
<H4>Rich pickings or fool's gold? </H4>
The international funding activities of Ashanti Goldfields have had a positive
impact on the Ghana Stock Exchange. The presence in world markets of a Ghanaian
company with a rock-solid reputation has awakened investors to the potential
of its home base. <BR>
<BR>
But one fund manager sounds a cautionary note. &quot;Investors should look
for a return over five to 10 years,&quot; says John Legat of GT Unit Trust's
Africa Fund. Despite its high profile and strong image relative to other
African exchanges, the Ghana Stock Exchange suffers from all the classic
emerging market problems: too few stocks, poor liquidity, slow settlement
(two weeks), antiquated systems and a lack of local investor interest. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What we need most to energize the market is a quick and efficient
delivery-versus-payment system,&quot; says Francis Tweneboa, the exchange's
general manager, &quot;and the listing procedure for companies on the exchange
is cumbersome. There has been no major review of the Companies Act since
legislation was passed in 1963.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The market also has to become more than just a trading post for Ashanti's
shares, helpful as the strong ties with Ghana's number one company have
proven<B>.</B> Ashanti makes up more than 90% of a total market capitalization
of over $2 billion. <BR>
<BR>
The listing in London last year, and the SEC registration of its $250 million
convertible bond in February (listed in New York), diversified the company's
investor base. According to Susan Lewis, assistant director of equity capital
markets at BZW, which with Goldman Sachs launched the issue: &quot;The proceeds
were in part to repay the acquisition funding for Cluff Resources and for
future expansion.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Fund managers say the offerings raised the standing of the company and,
at the same time, encouraged nascent Africa funds to examine the potential
of Ghana. Their perception is that the country is taking one more step towards
integration into the global economy. This may be true although investors
with direct experience of working in Accra, and coping with the exchange's
shortcomings, have a more jaundiced view. <BR>
<BR>
However, they are cautiously optimistic about a $2 million World Bank loan
to raise the exchange to international standards. A key component will be
the establishment of a securities regulator independent of the Bank of Ghana.
From the outset, multilateral institutions have played an important role
in assisting the exchange, which started floor trading in November 1990.
At that time Cooper's &amp; Lybrand was brought in by the IFC to establish
a market framework. <BR>
<BR>
The Ghana Stock Exchange has 12 licensed broking firms with 11 actively
trading. One, SDC Brokerage Services, is part of Securities Discount Company
Investments, which was subject to a devestating report early in April by
Bill Whitworth, a former managing director of Ecobank. Whitworth declared
that it was a &quot;company out of control and drifting toward catastrophe&quot;,
and concluded that disastrous loans and poor management meant the bank was
insolvent. SDC's non-executive chairman, Afare Donkor, was forced to resign
one of his other jobs, that of stock exchange chairman. <BR>
<BR>
From the 11 other broking firms, 32 people now work on the bourse . According
to Tweneboa all are university graduates and some have professional qualifications
in accountancy or banking. Five course modules designed by Cooper's &amp;
Lybrand, as well as exposure to foreign stock markets, push them further
up the learning curve, says Tweneboa. <BR>
<BR>
Trading happens three times a week at 10 o'clock by a call-over system.
Brokers sit around a table and take turns to make offers or bids as each
stock is announced. They can adjust their prices during a second round of
calling, after which deals are matched and recorded on computer. <BR>
<BR>
One challenge is to make portfolio investment attractive, and Tweneboa is
encouraged by measures such as the ending of triple taxation on dividends
paid to individuals who hold company shares through unit trusts. Much more
needs to be done, he argues, to create a level playing field with direct
investment in unlisted companies. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We need to build an infrastructure that is non-discriminatory,&quot;
he says. For the time being listed companies are protected from foreign
takeover by a 74% limit on non-resident holdings and a 10% individual restriction.
Another problem which restricts liquidity, points out Ken Ofori-Atta, chairman
of Databank Brokerage, is that multinationals hold around 50% to 60% of
their own shares. <BR>
<BR>
Foreign portfolio investment is made easier by Barclays Bank which has been
in Ghana since 1917. Through Barclays Global Securities Service, the bank
has provided custodial services since 1994. Without access to secure custody
arrangements, international investors would stay away. <BR>
<BR>
However, the golden rule in emerging markets is that foreign investment
doesn't start to flow until local buying takes off. This is a problem in
Ghana. Demonetization of the C50 note and freezing of bank accounts above
C50,000, 15 years ago after Rawling's second coup, hasn't been forgotten.
Spare cash tends to go into real assets, especially residential property.
<BR>
<BR>
The World Bank estimates that 45% of private sector savings are mobilized
through informal channels. In particular, itinerant bankers called <I>susu</I>
collectors visit shops and markets daily and receive funds for savings plans.
<BR>
<BR>
Databank's Ofori-Atta, agrees that it is crucial to &quot;change the Ghanaian
cultural perception of what shares are; that is, a great way of saving&quot;.
It is also important to accelerate the privatization programme, and continue
to provide incentives for investors, he says. The abolition of stamp duty
two years ago, and a capital gains tax holiday until 2000 has helped. But
the slow pace of privatization and the restricted supply of new tradeable
securities means the stock market's momentum has stalled. Only a third of
the 260 state-owned enterprises have been divested since privatization began
in 1988, and there is still little prospect that four behemoths - Ghana
Telecom, State Insurance Corporation, Ghana Oil Corporation and State Housing
Corporation - will be divested soon. <B>Rupert Gordon-Walker</B> <BR>

<h3>EMERGING MARKETS</h3>

VIETNAM
</H4>

<h2>Vietnam up to its old tricks?</h2>

<P >
<font size=3>
Is Vietnam up to its old tricks, playing cat and mouse with<BR>
western banks as it once did with American troops? Or is it a recently liberalized Communist country, out of its depth in the capitalist world of markets and bankers? That is the question puzzling bankers and debt holders as they struggle to understand why the country has still not settled its lengthy negotiations with the London Club to reschedule $750 million worth of unserviced private-sector loans and interest.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
At issue is the extent of forgiveness. The State Bank, which last year negotiated a rescheduling of the country's debt with the Paris Club, covering foreign government creditors, received 50% forgiveness - a generous settlement recognizing Vietnam's progress towards opening up its economy and keeping inflation under control. The creditor banks have no intention of being so lenient, and they are offering the Vietnamese Bank of Foreign Trade a maximum of 35%.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The Vietnamese are restrained from accepting the offer by suspicion and ignorance, says Peter Scott, the chairman of Beta Funds, a fund manager which invests in Vietnamese debt. "The government in Vietnam does not understand the difference between government and commercial debt. If the Bank of Foreign Trade does not get 50% forgiveness, it will be regarded as having failed. They will think the foreigners are trying to cheat them." Scott believes the negotiations will drag on past the Communist Party congress in June and others believe until the end of the year.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Hanging on the conclusion of the negotiations is Vietnam's return to the international capital markets. The country has been talking for almost two years about a Eurobond issue valued<BR>
at between $100 million and<BR>
$200 million. But this is unlikely to be issued until the current negotiations are settled. Early last year, Nomura, which is advising the government, said the bond would be issued by the end of the year. At the end of the year, they said it would be issued in the first quarter of this year. Now Nomura expects nothing before the end of the year. Two groups are watching the negotiations with special interest: the current holders of the debt want to know its value (the greater the forgiveness, the lower the debt's value); and farsighted members of the country's government who are getting itchy feet. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The latter group includes the secretary general of the Vietnamese Communist Party who has led the pack baying for a quick settlement. Earlier this year, he said that Vietnam risked becoming a debtor nation and a "wage-earner for capitalists" unless it repaid the debt owed to international creditors. The western bankers ironically agree with the party official, as some are getting heartily fed up with the negotiations. According to Peter Bartlett of Banque Indosuez, "if the negotiations drag on, then creditors could become more intransigent and demand less forgiveness, or no forgiveness at all as the economic outlook for the country improves".
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
A further puzzling element in the delay is the comparatively small amount of the debt, an amount well within Vietnam's capacity to settle. Says Jerome Booth, head of research at ANZ Bank: "Creditors are not in a mood to forgive. This is a country which has enormous growth and is much in fashion. The creditors feel they are in a strong bargaining position."
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Creditors' impatience briefly surfaced late last year, when a British Virgin Islands-registered company - Abbotsford Investments - got so fed up with the delay in settling its debt that it threatened to sue Vietcombank, Vietnam's largest state-owned bank, for repayment in full. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell came to the government's rescue by buying out the debt at a favourable price. The move raised the spectre of other non-London Club creditors challenging the government in the courts.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The timing of a settlement is only one factor for the debt holders who, despite everything, believe they are sitting on a good investment. Other factors are the amount of forgiveness likely to be granted and the amount of past due interest (PDI) likely to be repaid by the Vietnamese and over what period. ANZ and Banque Indosuez argue that Vietnamese bonds, which currently stand at 80% of face value, will trade up to 110% of value<B> </B>and further, once the deal with the London Club is obtained. They reach this number by working backwards from the highest value that could be placed on the bond. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Vietnam owes more than 100% of the face value in interest, so if it were to repay the entire debt and all the interest, the bond would theoretically be worth 210%. If, as seems more likely, it only repays 65% of the face value, and only the first-generation interest (ie not the interest on interest or the default fee), the number comes down to 130%. The debt will be repaid through the issue of new 10- or 15-year bonds, and the banks estimate the cost of carrying these bonds at a further 20%.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
ANZ Bank believes the bonds will trade at 500 basis points over treasuries. But these calculations cannot take account of the one unpredictable element in the current London Club negotiations - the length of the cat-and-mouse game now in progress. If this goes on to the end of the year, the cost of holding the bond starts to eat away significantly at the capital upside expected following a deal. One bank argued that 10% could be lost were the negotiations to go into the new year. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Banks argue that the Vietnamese would serve themselves - and the banks - better if they agreed to pay the full face-value of the outstanding debt. That would improve their image in the markets and obtain a higher rating when they come with their sovereign bond. One suggestion is that the full face value could be met relatively painlessly by issuing a bullet bond at par, with low interest payments and a maturity of 20 or 30 years.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
This approach would make sense if Vietnam did not have to settle its Russian debt as well. Vietnam has some 10 times more debt outstanding to Russia than it has to the west, and a good deal in London might give the Russians some ideas. With so many political and economic issues at stake, perhaps it is no wonder the Vietnamese are taking their time.     <B>Nick Kochan</B>

<B>LATIN AMERICA</B>

<H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>Big push by foreign banks</B>
</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Only 15 months after the<BR>
Mexican devaluation crisis, foreign investment banks are in the midst of an aggressive expansion of their operations within the Latin American region. Since late last year there has been a flurry of new office openings, as part of an effort to win equity and debt underwriting mandates, as well as advisory mandates for privatizations and private sector M&amp;A deals.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
One of the most favoured countries is Peru, which is enjoying robust economic growth and is in the midst of a major privatization programme. Last December Merrill Lynch opened an office in Lima. It was followed in January by Robert Fleming, the UK-based international investment bank. And in a visit to Lima in early January, ING Group chairman Aad Jacobs announced that ING Barings, which already has a research presence in Peru with six analysts, would soon be opening a brokerage with a seat on the local stock exchange.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The timing of Jacobs' announcement coincided with the pitch by ING, in alliance with Morgan Stanley, for the lead position on the upcoming international equity offering from Telef&oacute;nica del Per&uacute;. It illustrates the importance placed by some houses on establishing a local presence in order to help win mandates - rather than simply flying in teams from New York for the big presentations. In the event, the Telef&oacute;nica mandate was awarded to Merrill Lynch, in alliance with JP Morgan.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The recently formed Fleming Latin Pacific is a 50:50 partnership between Robert Fleming and two former senior officials in the Peruvian government. Carlos Montoya is a former chief executive of the state privatization agency Comisi&oacute;n de Promoci&oacute;n de la Inversi&oacute;n (Copri) which, since the beginning of the 1990s, has overseen one of the world's most extensive privatization programmes, raising $8 billion from the sale of holdings in sectors such as mining, telecommunications and energy. Emilio Zuniga is a former chairman of Petroper&uacute;, the state-owned<BR>
oil company.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The joint venture will initially employ 10 executives and focus on capital markets, international M&amp;A and research. In addition to Peru, the office will cover the other member countries of the Andean Pact - Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador. The name Fleming Latin Pacific reflects an unusual aspect of Fleming's strategy: it will stress equity investment from Asia in addition to the more traditional sources of Europe and North America. "Asian investors should look east as well as west," comments Raymond Kelly, the New York-based sales director for North America, who points to the strengths of Jardine Fleming as one of the most powerful equity houses in Asia.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Goldman Sachs is strengthening its presence in Brazil. Last November, it opened up a representative office in Sao Paulo, with the emphasis on cross-border equity and debt financing, M&amp;A, structured finance and project finance, and it is also opening an office in Mexico, where the firm will have a trading presence as well as local underwriting capabilities. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
"Each of these offices will allow us to be participants in the local environment, to interact with our clients on a more frequent basis and to have a level of dialogue that you wouldn't have in terms of frequency or breadth and depth if you were visiting from New York," explains Jaime Yordan, a Goldman partner based in the new S&atilde;o Paulo office.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Salomon Brothers is also in the midst of adding to its Latin American network and, last October, made a 49% investment in the corporate finance, fixed-income and equity businesses of Merchant Bankers Asociados (MBA) in Buenos Aires. The investment was made via a<BR>
capital increase in two MBA sub-<BR>
sidiaries: MBA Banco de<BR>
Inversiones, a wholesale bank engaged in fixed-income trading, and MBA Sociedad de Bolsa, an Argentine broker-dealer in equities. The move by Salomon formalized an existing corporate finance relationship with MBA, and expands this relationship into cooperation in the domestic capital markets.

This year is expected to see more alliances between Latin American institutions and foreign banks - a clear signal that not only is there lucrative advisory business to be won, but that the big foreign houses believe the flow of international debt and equity offerings is about to surge forward once more, as institutional investors put the Mexico shock behind them and return to buying Latin debt and equities.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Unfazed by the fact that the recent bull run in Asian emerging markets has largely bypassed China, the region's wilier deal-makers are eagerly pushing China "concept" stocks in both the primary and secondary markets. Investors weary of years of poor returns from a long list of Chinese products and offerings, will not be surprised to hear that the new issues contain a mixture of the good and the bad.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
While bourses in Hong Kong, Jakarta and Manila posted gains of over 25% in the three months to February, Chinese markets, in contrast, failed to recover from a disastrous 1995. Share prices in Shenzhen fell by 31.3% last year - the worst performance in Asia - while Shanghai B shares (reserved for foreign investors) dropped 24.1%. Shanghai has continued its descent into the new year with the composite index down by 21% in the past three months.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Few apart from the most committed of B-share vendors expect a revival. A two-week closure of the domestic markets from mid-February for Lunar New Year celebrations is only one of many reasons cited for bearishness. "I am still very cynical about the Chinese stock markets," says Clive Weedon, head of institutional sales at HG Asia<B> </B>in Hong Kong. "The full impact of the central government's two-year austerity programme is yet to be felt at most listed companies and there is little good news in the offing."
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Graham Ormerod, head of China research at Jardine Fleming Securities, agrees: "With the reporting season due to begin in April, we will be hearing from many Chinese companies for the first time in over a year. There is a strong possibility of some nasty surprises which could compound institutional investors' already jaded view of transparency in China. Coupled with very poor liquidity [turnover in Shanghai's 36 B shares averaged less than $3 million a day in the first two weeks of February], it is difficult to see foreign investors returning to either Shanghai or Shenzhen.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Similar concerns have dogged China's H share companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) with the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index under-performing the local Hang Seng Index by 35.8% over the past 12 months. "I see very little to be excited about for the H share companies," says Andrew Freris, chief regional economist at Salomon Brothers Hong Kong. "They are operating under a painfully tight monetary policy and I fear earnings will be at best flat for over two years down<BR>
the line."
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Investors are still recovering from last autumn's H share results shocks. Anhui province's Maanshan Iron &amp; Steel, for instance, weighed in with after-tax profits of just Rmb40 million ($4.8 million) for the six months ended June 30. That was a stunning 93% down on the year earlier. Almost as precipitous was the 72.7% fall in China's biggest domestic cargo handler Shanghai Haixing Shipping's first-half earnings: a decline that sparked a one-day sell-off of its shares producing a 27% fall in the<BR>
stock price. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
But analysts are quick to contrast the fortunes and credentials of the B and H share companies with those of the "red chip" Chinese corporations - usually subsidiaries of mainland enterprises - that have been listed on the SEHK for several years. Star performers among these in recent months have included CITIC Pacific, Guangdong Investments and China Resources, all of whose shares have soared along with, and sometimes ahead of, the Hang Seng Index. "I am very bullish on red chips in both the short and long term," says <BR>
Freris. "They offer investors liquidity and transparency while management at most is on a different planet to the H share companies."
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The strong record of such counters has not been lost on investment bankers keen to exploit any morsel of positive Chinese news. Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Securities Asia (CLSA) proved to be ahead of the game when it packaged Hong Kong property company New World Development's Chinese projects into a $267 million initial public offering (IPO) for New World Infrastructure (NWI) last year. The offering was oversubscribed by<BR>
19 times and NWI's share price rose by 42% in the first six weeks of 1996 to a high of HK$20.1. "NWI is part of a new trend for the larger Hong Kong developers to become quasi-red chip players," says Weedon.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
An equally rapturous reception was given to the SEHK share issue of HK$1.37 billion ($177 million) raised by Tingyi Holdings in January. The Taiwan-based noodle manufacturer was marketed as a China concept stock because of its high profile in the Chinese convenience food market. And though priced over its initial indicated range at HK$1.68 per share, by lead manager Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, and launched amid growing political and military tension between China and Taiwan, the deal was oversubscribed by 15 times. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Tingyi's stock traded up to HK$2.1 within one month of the issue. Similarly structured issues are now being touted for Taiwanese red chips, President Enterprise, Wei Chuan Food and Tung Ho Steel.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Perhaps the most controversial new issue is the HK$5 billion spin-off listing by Henderson Land Development of Henderson China, comprising the company's mainland property interests, scheduled for March on the SEHK. A HK$1.5 billion IPO is expected for Henderson China, according to sponsor CLSA, together with the HK$3.5 billion in convertible bonds (CBs) issued by its parent in October 1993 which carried a three-year<BR>
deadline for conversion. Henderson's offering has raised eyebrows in Hong Kong because of a surprise revaluation of the group's Chinese property interests as at December 1995. The total land bank of Henderson China stands at 22 projects with a gross floor area of 27.9 million square feet according to CLSA and is valued at HK$13.89 billion. This figure includes $8.09 billion described by the group as "surplus" arising from the December revaluation. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
"One building in particular, the Beijing Henderson Centre, is given a capital value of HK$6.89 billion," says the property analysts at one leading Hong Kong securities company. "And this represents more than a third of the total value of Henderson China and two-thirds of the overall revaluation surplus. But we have been given no reason for the increase in value and such a large upgrade is difficult to substantiate."
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Analysts find the revaluation, coming 10 months before the deadline for conversion of Henderson China's CBs,<BR>
particularly perplexing in view of the problems that have afflicted the Chinese real-estate sector since the austerity programme took hold in July 1993.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
A dearth of transactions has made the market difficult to assess but, says one analyst,"a glut of new projects and the poor performance of listed Chinese real-estate companies suggest that it is under pressure". Even red chips, it seems, must be approached with caution.              &#009;<B>Tony Shale</B>

<B>BALTICS</B>
</H4>
<H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>Building on a healthy trade</B>
</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Estonia finally looks set to launch a formal stock market when the Tallinn Stock Exchange starts trading on May 31. Although it will be the last of three Baltic states to establish an exchange, Estonia is not only the most advanced economically, it has also created a solid technical infrastructure for the market. While Lithuania remains bogged down in its banking crisis and Latvia's economy was dragged down by last year's collapse of Baltija Bank, Estonia is one of the fastest-growing countries in eastern Europe, with GDP set to expand by 5% this year. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
A healthy over-the-counter (OTC) market already exists, with shares traded through the central depository, the EVK (which claims a 100% success rate in settling trades). OTC turnover is currently around ECr15 million ($1.2 million) a week (compared with $2.4 million in Lithuania in 1995 and $35,000 in Latvia). Trading in Estonia is concentrated heavily in a handful of stocks. Hansa Bank - the largest in the Baltics - is the most actively traded (accounting for around half of all turnover during some months), with the Tallinn Department Store, Saku Brewery, Bank of Tallinn and Savings Bank being the other main active market constituents. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
These are likely to form the core of the Tallinn Stock Exchange's trading activity. As in the other Baltic markets, private entrepreneurs are expected to be slow in listing their companies. "The whole idea of being a public enterprise is not a common notion in Estonia," says Helo Meigas, the Tallinn Stock Exchange project manager. Her view is echoed by Karlis Cerbulis, the president of Latvia's Riga Stock Exchange, who says: "The truth in eastern Europe is that capital-raising only happens a few years after markets get going through privatization." 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Privatization has done little to breathe life into Estonian securities trading. It began in 1992, but did not get going on a large scale until early 1994.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
However, the success of the public sale of shares in the privatized Tallinn Department Store and the Saku Brewery in 1995 is one reason why Meigas now believes the government is more interested than it was a year ago. Privatization of four major state assets - rail, telecom, ports and energy - is expected later this year, with details of the reorganization of the companies involved due in June.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Nevertheless, the government's own financial position still means that its enthusiasm for the securities market is limited. As the Estonian Privatization Agency's foreign relations manager, Kulliki Linnamagi, explains, the aim of privatization is "to restart industry, not to fill the state budget". Hence there is less need to nurture a buoyant securities market as a way of obtaining better prices for privatized shares. Nor does the government need a securities market to help it sell T-bills: Estonia's balanced budget requirement means that there continues to be practically no market for government bonds.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Trading on the Tallinn Stock Exchange will be daily (unlike the Latvian and Lithuanian exchanges) and rules are being drafted to meet EU standards. Lithuania's was the first market to get under way in the Baltics and it should be the first to be included in the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) emerging markets index, later this year. Leading stocks in the banking and industrial sectors - Kalnapilis Brewery, Vilnius Bank and Hermis Bank - have<BR>
already attracted foreign<BR>
investor interest. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
As in the other Baltic states, a reduction in interest rates to improve the relative attractiveness of equities over bonds would be positive for the market. Three-month interest rates in Lithuania were 38% in February - more than 10% above the rate of inflation. The Riga Stock Exchange needs a different kind of stimulus: more product to trade. Twenty-nine companies were privatized for vouchers in January 1995 and they got the market going in July last year. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The listing of the privatized Unibanka in January 1996 effectively tripled volumes but, apart from the privatized companies, Cerbulis says, "only one other reasonably-sized company has issued shares, the Rigas<BR>
Komerc Bank". 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
More product will be available when Latvian Gas is privatized later this year. Two per cent of its shares are being offered to the public and a further 300 companies will be sold. Cerbulis hopes more of the good companies, privatized in the early days of the sell-off process, will come to the market. He thinks fraud opportunities have dropped and that there's a recognition of the need for a regulated marketplace <BR>
in the wake of last year's<BR>
banking crisis.&#009;

<H3>DIARY OF AN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT BANKER </h3>

<H4>When in Rome, don't count your chickens Komarovsky and Ingersoll go surfing
and rediscover the lost art of global whingeing JJ Ingersoll, our head of
global focus, is talking incessantly about technology because he says &quot;that's
where the kids are at&quot;. I don't look convinced, so he double-clicks
on his mouse, and tells me to watch this. A whole series of windows peel
like bananas before my eyes. </H4>
Suddenly I have the sensation of surfing. How energetic! Pixels of spray
gently splash on my face, a sweet vibration rings in my ears. JJ tells me
to duck and prepare to enter the tube. If I can just stay on my mouse! <BR>
<BR>
I do and we arrive. The place is the worldwide bank-chit-chat page [www.comm.globspeak],
an exclusive club where you need half a million airmiles to get invited.
JJ says he spends most of his day browsing through it, and I ask whether
this is why he hasn't left the office for two weeks and seems to be completely
out of touch with the staff. His hand is shaking from a repetitive-clicking
disorder. <BR>
<BR>
Never mind that he says, as his hand reverts to the more familiar twanging
of his braces. He types in the words GUARANTEED BONUS, and pulls out all
the e-mail conversations on the subject. He puts his sunglasses on. &quot;We're
going in,&quot; says JJ as he waxes his mouse and the first message begins
to flash. All I can do is watch and read, mesmerized by the unlimited opportunities
of this sort of fax-machine that travels in cyberspace. <BR>
<BR>
Date: 4.6.96 <BR>
From: Aad Jacoops, To: my friends at the global club. &quot;We at ClogBank,
the premier name in clog trade finance, and owner of Boring Bank, are increasingly
aware that the global marketplace is not quite as friendly as the clog market,
where honourable men hollow functional footware from wood, and decorate
it with pretty patterns. No, it has come to our attention that if we ignore
the savage jungle - beginning in the darkest regions of Bishopsgate
and ending at Moorgate - we are no different to little boys putting
our fingers in dykes. So we will do as Romans do, since we are in London.
That is, we will not pay our bondholders, but pay our staff lots instead.
My colleague, Hessel Heliumberg would like to have a word too.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
4.6.96<BR>
 From: Heliumberg, chief exec. &quot;I would like to add how pleased we
are with the retention rate of staff at Boring Bank, an interesting British
concern, which we bought out of a particular interest in its emerging market
teams, especially in Latin America. Any suspicions we might have had as
to their being flippant, money-oriented job-hoppers were quickly appeased
when Sir Peter allowed myself and Aad to clean his car, a Rolls-Royce Silver
Devil. Nearly a year and a half on from the acquisition we think we have
won the trust and respect of all the staff - they are even recommending
us to their tailors. So great is our confidence, that as of today we are
unfastening all the golden handcuffs which we now feel are an insult to
the integrity and loyalty of our British staff.&quot; Ends. <BR>
<BR>
6.6.96 <BR>
From Heliumberg, To: Hilmar Koppout and Michael Dobbo, chief cheque-signers,
Die Lebensraum Bank. &quot;May I take this opportunity to formally point
out that we, not you, paid &#163;1 <BR>
for Boring Bank and in order for us to realize a return on this equity it
would be helpful if you stopped asking all our staff to join you. Please
be aware that in spite of Aad Jacoops' comment about being Romans, he only
meant this in relation to us employing other people's staff, and not of
course your taking 44 of ours in Mexico, Chile, Brazil and New York. If
you poach any more clogs you will force me to pick up my telephone and speak
to the large pink newspaper.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
7.6.96 <BR>
From Michael Dobbo. &quot;We are an ambitious bank which pays bonuses big
enough to buy hospital wings, in convertible currency and guarantees them
for three years. I see nothing wrong with that, nor would you if you had
hidden reserves like ours. It's cheaper than buying Lameman Brothers. Do
stop whingeing.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
7.6.96 <BR>
From Edson von Mitchell. &quot;Some people misunderstand my hiring policy.
When I tell someone to think of a number, double it, and then multiply it
by a million guaranteed over three years that is only a sign that the moment
of global domination quickly approaches.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
8.6.96 <BR>
From: Dan Sully, chief guy, Marvel Lynch. &quot;When we lost 500 people
to one firm which shall remain nameless, we took it on the chin like Joe
di Maggio - like the sluggers we are, simply bouncing and swaying,
we came off the ropes, and started the next round. Ding Ding. We ignored
every bigshot exit - we let 'em all go. Because even if everyone left,
leaving only me at this great firm, single-handledly managing myself, dealing
in 9,800 countries - on my own - I know we'd still have client
focus coming out our collective ass...&quot; <BR>
<BR>
8.6.96 <BR>
From Rudi Miller-Lite, Union Bank of Ebner. &quot;When I started in this
business, I was so happy to work for UBE that I asked my father to pay the
bank to allow me to work there. Money well spent, I think. But clearly this
sort of thing does not happen anymore. It is not uncommon these days for
staff to even change jobs, although I cannot see why anyone should want
to. But I began to get very concerned when I heard that some traders are
even paid bonuses these days. The other night all of this really hit home
when I was at a dinner party with a young doctor. He was working 400 hours
a week, earned less than $50,000 and was not even allowed to keep any airmiles
because of course he does not travel. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I asked one of the Harley Street medical specialists sitting opposite
me how it was possible that an industry that saves lives could be paid so
badly, and he said yes it's true, he only earned $2.5 million a year at
his liposuction practice. Whereupon I commented how some of my colleagues
earn four times that, and something must be wrong with the world. Maybe
we should selectively hang, draw and quarter people who earn bonuses but
are unable to perform basic surgery? This might scare a few employees into
thinking twice about their worth and how this industry has slowly but surely
lost touch with reality.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
9.6.96 <BR>
From: JJ Ingersoll, Black Knight. &quot;I don't think we're going far enough.
Employees need further incentives, but maybe not just cash, because that
makes it too easy for them to go. I suggest all employees get a personal
jet and helicopter, both of which can be confiscated if they leave. This
would solve the remuneration question for good.&quot;

<H3>TIME OUT</H3>
<H2>Corporate punishment </H2>
<H4>The achiever's lifestyle tends towards the over-indulgent and overweight.
But everyday fitness is easy to achieve </H4>

<B>By Anita van de Vliet </B><BR>
<BR>
What did you do at Davos this year? Discuss the economic issues of the day?
Cast your mind forward to the technological challenges of the morrow? Catch
up with old chums? Network with new ones? Well, that is one way of doing
it. But if you were a remotely typical member of the World Economic Forum,
your programme could also probably be described as follows. <BR>
<BR>
You talked and ate and drank, then talked and drank some more, and then,
replete with food for thought, you slouched exhausted into bed. Next morning
you cast an approving eye on the snow-covered beauty visible beyond the
hotel window, but resisted the lure of the great outdoors and took the bus
to the conference centre. There you talked, ate and talked a whole lot more,
until the bus brought you back in the evening, to talk and eat and drink.
At the end of the session you may have been one of the little band of enthusiasts
who stayed on for a few days' skiing; but more likely you flew back home
halfway across the world and either spent your time eating and drinking
and snoozing to while away the flight, or resolutely read and wrote reports.
You were back at your desk with your usual admirable promptness and with
your usual disdain for such wimpish complaints as jet lag. <BR>
<BR>
Readers whose experience of Davos was very different - those who walked
to the conference centre, for example, or performed their usual daily exercises
in the privacy of their hotel bedrooms - need read no further. But
the rest should reflect on the above picture and on the old issue of <I>mens
sana in corpore sano</I> (or healthy mind, healthy body). <BR>
<BR>
For Davos, of course, is only one reflection of the prevailing pattern of
executive life, which is almost invariably composed of very long hours,
most of them sedentary; corporate entertaining, much of it involving far
too much food and alcohol; tight timetables and a heavy travel schedule.
It is part of the general trend away from physicality in western society,
comments Stephen Ferns, health editor of <I>GQ</I> men's magazine: &quot;Our
obsession with efficiency is making the physical body obsolete.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
So what can the busy executive do to keep fit before a heart attack serves
as only too thumping a reminder of the existence of that exquisitely intricate
organism, the body? The answer lies in adopting a fresh approach to eating,
exercising and relaxing: thinking in terms of the positive benefits of fitness
and treating the body with the respect it deserves. <BR>
<BR>
First, in the unlikely event that you still smoke - don't! Giving up
is easier than most people think. Not having to look for ashtrays, ask permission
or open windows when out and about on business or pleasure saves time and
face. And the facts about smoking (unlike the so-called evidence on passive
smoking, which is more dubious) are stark. <BR>
<BR>
When it comes to eating and drinking, on the other hand, a certain scepticism
over the wisdom of the experts as relayed in the media is understandable.
A remarkable array of foods and drinks - eggs, coffee, alcohol, butter,
margarine - have been forbidden over the years, only to be virtually
prescribed by the succeeding generation of dietary gurus. Everyone has noticed,
too, how remarkably unhealthy so many of the folk working in the health
food shops look, despite consuming their fill of organically grown produce
and dosing up on strange roots, garlic pills and hyper-charged vitamin pills.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Danger of food fashions </B><BR>
<BR>
But excessive scepticism can just be an excuse for staying the way that
you are - which could, conceivably, be over-indulgent and overweight.
So without being fanatical about it, why not just cut down on animal fats,
step up the fruit and vegetables, eat up your pasta, drink only in moderation
and see if you feel better as a result? <BR>
<BR>
Do not always copy the regime followed personally by your trainer: on my
own first such meeting I discovered the trainer looking wonderfully well,
smoking a cigarette and drinking a gin and tonic at 2.30 in the afternoon.
Remember, however, that this approach was combined with a hair-raising schedule
of exercise. For ordinary mortals, moderation in eating, drinking and fads
might be easier. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Flout the convention of success </B><BR>
<BR>
Next, turn your attention to exercise. Forget the excuse that you are too
busy, working a 12-hour day and all that. &quot;It's a question of priorities,&quot;
urges health editor Ferns (himself also a playwright and a former personal
trainer). &quot;There's usually too much pressure on people to succeed at
work, to work long hours, and to be seen to be working long hours. Too many
people at the top neglect the physical and psychological well-being of their
staff (not to mention their own). Until they do take these seriously people
will continue to suffer from stress, that disease of the 20th century, and
to die from it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
What is needed, he says, is a general shift in attitude: people need to
flout convention and leave the office on time, boldly declaring their destination
as the gym or the park. And if anyone criticises or makes that well-worn
jibe &quot;Working part-time, eh?&quot;, says Ferns, the remedy is to take
15 minutes off to explain the rationale. <BR>
<BR>
The best companies in the US and Europe now run health and fitness centres
of their own, such as the state-of-the-art &quot;Lean Machine&quot; gym
and &quot;Orchard&quot; centre at automotive parts company Unipart in Oxford,
England, which aim to teach employees how to reduce and manage stress through
exercise and the sumptuous pleasures of aromatherapy and reflexology. <BR>
<BR>
With the choice of exercise, as with healthy eating, the key is enjoyment.
There is no point in condemning yourself masochistically to half an hour
on the rowing machine, which you hate, when you could be walking briskly
round the park, which you like and which will do as much good. On the other
hand there is no point in jogging through the polluted air of a city centre
if you actually prefer striding out on one of those nifty walking machines,
since you can combine this with either reading or watching television. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Stop-go eating policies </B><BR>
<BR>
&quot;The sports or exercise activities you do not enjoy are those you are
likely to give up,&quot; remarks Ferns. And since variety is the spice of
life, he suggests making a menu of activities that appeal. &quot;It does
not have to be sport: why not take up dancing, for example?&quot; Workaholics,
meanwhile, should definitely avoid all competitive sports which simply reinforce
their need to keep on achieving. <BR>
<BR>
As with eating wisely, what matters most with exercise is consistency. Like
crash diets and the yo-yo approach to weight loss and gain, sedentary phases
followed by bouts of violent exercise are as unproductive in the long run
as stop-go economic policies. &quot;Exercising consistently, even at a low
level, is the key,&quot; advises Joanna Berry, managing director of the
National Register of Personal Trainers in Britain. <BR>
<BR>
Even when not officially exercising, she adds, use those limbs: take the
stairs instead of the elevator; walk to places within a mile rather than
taking the car; walk to the station if you commute. Think about your posture;
slumped over your desk in imitation of Rodin's statue, the <I>Thinker</I>,
your attitude of concave concentration makes it hard for your lungs to expand
and thus for oxygen to reach your muscles, including your heart. If you
really want to learn how to breathe then take up yoga, which will also teach
you how to relax. <BR>
<BR>
Still undecided? For a growing number of people, a personal trainer is the
solution to finding the menu of exercise that suits. Leaving aside the status
motive - appointing a lithe blonde trainer as yet another adjunct to
corporate one-upmanship - Berry explains that people choose trainers
because they may be too embarrassed to venture out on their own: feeling
overweight, underweight or just inept, they are intimidated by the muscle-men
and high-stepping creatures in leotards at the gym and aerobics sessions.
They may hate the pounding music which reverberates through these places.
They may need the discipline which a personal trainer provides. Or they
may even have been given the trainer sessions as a 40th or 50th birthday
present. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tax-free trainers </B><BR>
<BR>
Whatever the reason, the advantages of having a personal trainer are obvious:
a programme of indoor and outdoor exercise based on an informed assessment
of the client's health and needs and adapted to his or her lifestyle and
timetable. Is it expensive? Again, this is a question of priorities: the
price of a session compares favourably with a restaurant meal. According
to Berry, most trainers would be happy if their clients exercised under
their supervision once a week and practised two or three times a week on
their own, which cuts down the cost. Furthermore, clients with clever accountants
will be able to deduct the expense from tax. <BR>
<BR>
When you go off on a business trip or to a conference, your personal trainer
will also provide you with a programme of exercise that you can follow.
But you can also help yourself during the flight by heeding the advice put
together by British Airways in its excellent &quot;Well-being in the air
programme&quot;. This proposes light food; a series of stretching exercises
for your legs, feet and hands; and simple massage techniques for head and
face, with more vigorous exercises for stops en route. While your head is
up in the clouds, you could do worse than contemplate the installation of
a company gym. But whatever you do, do not forget to take your walking shoes
to Davos next year.<p>

<H2>Romania scores hit with Euromarket bond debut </H2>

<h4>
ROMANIA'S REHABILITATION in the international capital markets was completed this week as the country's central bank attracted overwhelming demand from
investors for its debut $225m Eurobond.
</h4>
The warm reception for the Romania deal underlines the demand for new
credits in the international markets -- and from eastern Europe in particular
-- as investors seek high-yielding debt at a time of low rates and new opportunities
to diversify fixed-income portfolios. <BR>
<BR>
Last month the Ba3/BB- rated National Bank of Romania issued &#165;52bn
of three-year Samurai bonds via Nomura. <BR>
<BR>
But the Eurodollar debut provided the opportunity for a more widespread
marketing effort to international investors, involving roadshows in Europe
and the US to explain the country's economic situation and credit. <BR>
<BR>
Such was the demand from investors that the three-year deal, lead managed
by Merrill Lynch, was increased from $150m to $225m before launch. <BR>
<BR>
The US investment bank earned praise from rivals for its handling of the
transaction. Priced with a 9.75% coupon to yield 305bp over Treasuries,
the spread narrowed to 295bp in early trading yesterday (Thursday). <BR>
<BR>
Members of the nine-strong co-lead management group reported overwhelming
demand from institutional and retail accounts for the issue, which -- like
other sovereign fixed-income offerings from the eastern European region
-- had significant scarcity value. <BR>
<BR>
The market consensus was that the pricing was attractive in view of Romania's
improving credit story, despite coming 35bp inside the spread on the country's
recent Samurai bond. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;With the general spread compression we've seen on emerging market
issues from central and eastern Europe over the past few months, a deal
which offers a 300bp-plus pick-up over US Treasuries was guaranteed to get
a warm reception from investors,&quot; commented one banker. <BR>
<BR>
An official at Merrill Lynch in London said the pricing reflected the National
Bank of Romania's overriding aim of ensuring a successful Eurobond debut.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's perhaps true that we could have done the deal at 300bp over,
but when launching an issue for a debut borrower there's no point in trying
to squeeze every last basis point from the market,&quot; he said. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We were absolutely delighted with the impeccable quality of the order
book we managed to build up for this transaction. We even had insurance
and pension fund accounts -- certainly not traditional buyers of such emerging
market issues -- coming to us for paper.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The success of Romania's transaction augurs well for other eastern European
sovereign issuers in the pipeline. <BR>
<BR>
Slovenia, Croatia, Russia and Kazakhstan are all preparing Eurodollar bond
debuts for launch later this year. <BR>

<H3> Asset-backed deals fly </H3> <P> A RECORD volume of
asset-backed transactions dominated the dollar bond market this week.

<P> A $3bn+ issue for Capita Equipment and $1bn offering for Deutsche Floorplan
achieved significant European placement, demonstrating the increasing acceptance
of this type of product outside the US.

<P> In the vanilla market Petronas, the Malaysian oil producer, scored a
spectacular debut with a three-tranche bond which was ultimately increased to
$1.9bn.

<P> Structured transactions were also the highlight of the sterling market, with
issues for Annington and Stagecoach enjoying success at &#163;903m and &#163;540m
respectively.

<P> The enthusiasm by Italian investors for zero coupon product inspired two
Deutschmark denominated transactions - for Deutsche Bank and the EIB.

<P> The lira market continued its busy pace of issuance as investors concentrated
on the high yielding European currencies and the New Zealand dollar also produced
a record weekly volume of NZ$500m of deals to satisfy investor demand for high
coupons.

<P> The highest yielder of them all however was a Slovak koruna bond for GECC.
The one-year transaction pays a juicy 11.625% and represents the first corporate
bond in this newly established sector.

<P> Looking ahead, Associates Corp is said to have mandated Goldman Sachs and
Lehman Brothers to raise $500m of five-year funds, while SuedwestLB and Trans
Tokyo Bay are still awaiting an opportune moment to bring their dollar issues.

<P> Brazil's $750m-$1bn global, due for launch later this month, is said to have
been mandated to JP Morgan and SBC Warburg.

<P> The trend for zero coupon bonds may well continue with the World Bank
rumoured to be contemplating a DM2bn deal, while Fannie Mae's Ffr3bn to Ffr5bn
long-dated issue is expected to be mandated shortly. 

<P>

<P>

<H4> <B>Despite measures by some governments to curb expenditure, with
deflationary effects on economic growth, the health of Arab banks remains good.
Banks from the Gulf Cooperation Council states, particularly Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain, continue to dominate the top 100 rankings. Martin Gallagher and Andrew
Ioannou analyze the latest results</B> </H4> 

<P> This year's Arab 100 is again
dominated by banks based in the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states,
reflecting their relatively large and well-developed economies. GCC-based banks
account for 66 of the 100 on 1995 figures, up three on the previous year. The
United Arab Emirates (UAE) has 19 names, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, with
14 entries each. Kuwait's share is unchanged at 11, while Oman and Qatar rose to
five and three respectively. The Gulf economies received a boost from higher oil
prices in 1995, but growth in the region's private sectors remained subdued as
governments continued to emphasize cutting high budget deficits. The three states
with the highest GDP growth rates in the region in 1995 &#173; the UAE, Oman and
Qatar &#173; increased their shares of entries in the top 100, while the more
sluggish performances of the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian economies is reflected by
a smaller representation.

<P> With 1995 GDP of over $125 billion, the Saudi Arabian economy is larger than
the other five GCC economies combined. Saudi-based financial institutions account
for five of the Arab world's 10 largest banks, measured by total capital. The
largest is the Islamic Development Bank, established in 1973 to foster the
economic development and social progress of member countries and Muslim
communities in accordance with Islamic law. It has 48 member countries and its
year-end 1995 capital was over $3.5 billion.

<P> In second place is the National Commercial Bank (NCB), which recently
announced that Sheikh Khalid Bin Mahfouz, who owns 98.8% of the share capital,
would be returning as chairman of the executive committee and general manager. In
1992 he resigned his position as deputy general manager and chief operating
officer to defend himself against allegations of fraud by the New York and
Luxembourg authorities over his involvement with the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI), where he was a director for just under a year in
the late 1980s. The charges against him were subsequently dropped in an
out-of-court settlement in 1995.

<P> <B>GCC and north African banks lead </B>

<P> In third place is Riyad Bank, which is nearly 30%-owned by the Saudi Arabian
Monetary Agency; in sixth Al Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation, the
world's largest bank operating strictly in accordance with Islamic banking
principles; and in eighth Saudi American Bank, which is 30%-owned by Citibank.

<P> The Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corporation (ABC) holds its fourth position.
Its main shareholders include the Kuwaiti finance ministry, the Abu Dhabi
Investment Authority and the Central Bank of Libya. By total assets it is the
largest bank in the Arab world. In April 1995, Ahmed Abdullatif, the former
managing director of Riyad Bank, became ABC's president and chief executive
following the departure of the long-serving and highly regarded Abdulla Saudi, a
Libyan national who was forced to resign because of US pressure.

<P> The only non-GCC bank in the top 10 is the Jordan-based Arab Bank at number
five, with year-end 1995 capital of over $1.25 billion. Arab Bank's founders, the
Shoman family, remain influential and occupy the bank's most senior positions.
Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri is also a major shareholder. Arab Bank also
holds significant shareholdings in two other banks in the top 100. The most
prominent is its 40% holding in the Saudi-based Arab National Bank (14). The
other holding is in the Arab Tunisian Bank (77)

<P> In seventh place is National Bank of Kuwait (NBK), Kuwait's largest and
strongest commercial bank. NBK is approximately two-thirds owned by leading
private-sector Kuwaiti business groups. Prominent among these are the Al-Kharafi,
Al-Bahar and Al-Hamad families, who exercise effective control through board
representation.

<P> The second-largest Kuwaiti institution in the top 10 is the Gulf Investment
Corporation (GIC), which rose from 10th to ninth. GIC is owned by the six GCC
member states and was established to promote economic growth, develop productive
private enterprise and support regional cooperation. GIC in turn 100% owns the
second-largest bank in the Bahrain offshore banking sector, Gulf International
Bank (GIB), which maintains an active regional and international presence. GIB
also rose one position to 16th this year. The National Bank of Dubai (10) is the
leading UAE-based bank. The ruling family of Dubai is understood to have the
largest stake in it, though not a controlling one.

<P> After the GCC, the most important Arab banking markets are in north Africa,
which accounts for 27 of the top 100. Once again Egypt leads the way with 12
entries, followed by Tunisia with seven, Morocco with five, Algeria with two and
Libya with one. The 11th-ranked Libyan Arab Foreign Bank (LAFB) is the largest by
capital. It is also a major shareholder in two other banks in the top 100: the
UAE-based Arab Bank for Investment and Foreign Trade (46) and the Bahrain-based
Al-Ubaf Arab International Bank (81), which is 95% owned by LAFB.

<P> The second-largest north African bank is Moroccan-based Cr&eacute;dit
Populaire du Maroc (18). It is government-owned and was established to promote
the development of small to medium-sized domestic businesses. Next comes the
National Bank of Egypt (23), the largest of Egypt's state-owned commercial banks.
The largest Tunisian bank, Banque Nationale Agricole (35), focuses on
agricultural credit. The first of the two Algerian-based banks in the top 100 is
Cr&eacute;dit Populaire d'Alg&eacute;rie (36).

<P> <B>Bahrain's diversity </B>

<P> Banks based in Jordan and Lebanon in the top 100 rose from five to seven.
Apart from Arab Bank, however, they are well down the list. The highest-ranked
Lebanese bank is Banque Audi (73), which is owned by the Audi and Sabbah
families. It is followed by Banque du Liban et d'Outre-Mer (80) and Byblos Bank
(84), which is 64% owned by the Luxembourg-based Byblos Invest Holding. However,
Lebanon has over 75 commercial banks and so consolidation is inevitable. Capital
Intelligence expects Lebanese banks to occupy higher positions in these rankings
in the next few years.

<P> By virtue of the size of the Saudi Arabian economy all the country's
commercial banks make the top 100. Apart from the five heavyweights in the top
10, another four are in the top 20. Three of these are foreign joint-venture
banks and are very similar in size: Saudi British Bank (12), 40% owned by HSBC
Holdings; Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi (13), 31% owned by Banque Indosuez; and Arab
National Bank (14), the Arab Bank affiliate. The Arab Petroleum Investments
Corporation, owned by all the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OAPEC) member states, which focuses on financing oil and gas projects, ranks
17th, down one from 1994. Other foreign joint-venture banks include Saudi Cairo
Bank (26), 20% owned by Egypt's Banque du Caire; and Saudi Hollandi Bank (39),
40% owned by ABN Amro. Recently, Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al
Saud, the high-profile chairman of United Saudi Commercial Bank (30), took a 33%
shareholding in Saudi Cairo Bank, raising the prospects of a merger.

<P> Saudi banks' results have been affected by measures to curb the country's
budget deficit. Private-sector activities are estimated to have slowed in 1995 to
a nominal growth rate of 2%, down from 4% in 1994. Domestic demand was restrained
by a freeze imposed on public-sector employment and a reduction of government
subsidies, which raised the cost of gasoline, utility charges and certain other
public-sector services. In certain cases, government payments to suppliers and
contractors were delayed, and this has had knock-on effects on banks. As a
result, Saudi banks invariably recorded rises in non-performing loans during
1995.

<P> The diverse and relatively sophisticated nature of the Bahrain financial
sector is indicated by the variety of Bahrain-based financial institutions in the
top 100, ranging from international offshore banking units (OBUs) and investment
banks to local commercial and Islamic banks. The two super-OBUs &#173; Arab
Banking Corporation and Gulf International Bank &#173; are well ahead among
Bahrain banks. The innovative and highly profitable Investcorp is third in
Bahrain and 27th overall. Economic and market conditions in North America and
western Europe were more conducive to the sale of some of its long-term equity
investments in 1995. The most notable was the successful global share offering of
the Gucci Group, a leading designer and distributor of luxury goods. The largest
of Bahrain's commercial banks, the National Bank of Bahrain (NBB), is 45th
overall. The local Bahrain market is clearly overbanked, and margins have been
under pressure as the economy has slowed. NBB's largest rival, the Bank of
Bahrain and Kuwait (52), whose shareholders include various Kuwaiti banks and
government entities, is the only foreign bank operating with a branch in Kuwait.

<P> <B>Kuwait's banks strengthen</B>

<P> Bahrain's largest Islamic bank is the Faysal Islamic Bank of Bahrain (67),
which operates under both an offshore banking licence and one recently granted
for local commercial banking. It is 53% owned by the influential Geneva-based Dar
Al-Maal Al Islami Trust, the other shareholders being wealthy Saudi investors.
The bank is active internationally and has a significant presence in Pakistan.
United Gulf Bank (50), is 95% owned by the Kuwait Investment Projects Company and
continues to focus on international financial investments through externally
managed and partly leveraged funds. Bahrain International Bank (53) is a strongly
capitalized and innovatively managed offshore banking unit. TAIB Bank (65) is
active in Turkey and the former Soviet states of central Asia. Bahrain Middle
East Bank (68) is largely owned by Kuwaiti interests, including the
government-controlled Burgan Bank, and after the installation of a new management
team in 1993 is continuing to reposition itself successfully as an investment
bank.

<P> The Kuwaiti banking sector strengthened in 1995 and all six of its commercial
banks remain in the top half of the Arab 100. Gulf Bank, Kuwait's second-largest,
dropped one position to number 20. In third place, 24th overall, is Commercial
Bank of Kuwait (CBK), which was arguably worst hit among Kuwait's banks by the
1982 Souk Al Manakh stock market crisis. Most of its loan book is still
classified as non-performing. Burgan Bank (25), the youngest Kuwaiti bank which
began operations in 1977, is 51% owned by the government of Kuwait and has a 28%
stake in Bahrain Middle East Bank. Alahli Bank of Kuwait (28), the third-largest
commercial bank in terms of assets, has, like CBK, had a chequered history and is
currently restructuring its balance sheet.

<P> <B>UAE buoyant but overbanked</B>

<P> Other Kuwaiti institutions in the Arab 100 include GCC-owned but
Kuwaiti-based Gulf Investment Corporation (9); the prosperous Kuwait Finance
House (37) which is 49% government-controlled and is Kuwait's premier Islamic
bank; and two state-owned specialized banks, Industrial Bank of Kuwait (44) and
Kuwait Real Estate Bank (48). These two institutions have just announced that
long-standing merger talks have been suspended. The outlook for Kuwaiti banks
remains closely linked with macroeconomic developments. The economy is expected
to cool in 1996, mainly because of sluggish growth in the non-oil sector. Kuwait
had the highest budget deficit to GDP ratio of the GCC states in 1995 (16.1%) and
the government's retrenchment exercise is dampening growth prospects. Lending
opportunities will remain relatively restricted. Overall, the Kuwaiti market is
still affected by two massive economic shocks in the last 15 years &#173; the
Souk Al Manakh crisis and the Iraqi invasion &#173; with business confidence
still somewhat fragile.

<P> In contrast, banks in the UAE are enjoying strong profit growth in what is
generally considered the Gulf's most buoyant economy. GDP is expected to grow by
5.6% in 1996, largely as result of a projected 5% growth in the non-oil sectors.
Most of the UAE banks improved their rankings. The National Bank of Abu Dhabi
(19) is majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and is the UAE's
largest bank by total assets. It is effectively banker to the government and its
balance sheet fluctuates with government placements and withdrawals. Abu Dhabi
Commercial Bank (21) and Emirates Bank International (EBI &#173; 22) are the
products of government-sponsored restructuring initiatives in 1985 when ailing
banks were merged to create larger, sounder institutions. EBI has built up a
solid franchise in the UAE's trading sector and is now looking to become more
active in international syndicated loans. MashreqBank (31) was established in
1967 as Bank of Oman, adopting its present name after organizational
restructuring in 1993. It is 50% owned by the prominent Al Ghurair family and by
assets is the fourth-largest UAE bank.

<P> The Commercial Bank of Dubai (CBD &#173; 55) is 20% owned by the government
of Dubai. It reported one of the largest profits increases (56%) in the UAE
during 1995. CBD is focusing on its commercial business rather than actively
expanding retail lending. Banks in some of the smaller emirates had mixed
performances in 1995. The National Bank of Fujairah (62) boosted profits from
trade finance and investment, while the National Bank of Umm Al-Qaiwain (71)
reversed 1994's fall in earnings with higher returns from its loan portfolio. The
National Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah's (78) net income was marginally lower, although
the previous year's performance had been distorted by a large write-back of
provisions. Overall, with 47 banks, the UAE market is overbanked and
consolidation among smaller players would make commercial sense. And although the
UAE has been more successful than some other GCC states at reducing its
dependency on oil, there are doubts about how some of the more marginal banks
would perform were there to be a sharp downturn in the UAE economy. Fortunately,
in the short term, that prospect looks remote.

<P> <B>Rankings by other criteria</B>

<P> When ranked by total assets, Saudi Arabian banks continue to dominate, with
nine representatives in the top 25. Arab Banking Corporation of Bahrain remains
the Arab world's largest bank by assets, with $21.3 billion at year-end 1995.
Then come two Saudi banks: National Commercial Bank (2) and Riyad Bank (3). In
fourth and fifth places, as in 1994, come Jordan's Arab Bank (5) and National
Bank of Kuwait (7).

<P> The two largest Egyptian public-sector banks vie for the sixth and seventh
positions, with Banque MISR (33) just edging ahead of National Bank of Egypt
(23). Saudi American Bank (8) continues to occupy eighth place, ahead of Gulf
International Corporation (9) in ninth position.

<P> When ranked by return on assets, smaller banks based in the UAE and Bahrain,
led by Middle East Bank (72), occupy 17 of the top 25 positions, with 10 and
seven banks, respectively. Saudi Arabia is down to four in the top 25 on this
measure, while Oman, Kuwait, Egypt and Tunisia each have one representative.

<P> In terms of return on equity, the leaders are more evenly distributed,
although 11 of the top 25 are banks operating in the more dynamic economies of
the UAE and Oman, with seven and four banks, respectively. As in 1994, the most
profitable Arab bank by this measure was the Egyptian American Bank. Overall,
Egypt and Saudi Arabia have four entries each, Kuwait has three, Lebanon has two
and Tunisia has one entry in the top 25.

<P> Special mention should be made of the two banks that are in all four top-25
rankings &#173; by capital, assets, return on equity and return on assets. They
are the Saudi Arabian-based Al Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation (6) and
Saudi American Bank (8).

<H3>LATIN AMERICA</H3>


<H2> <B>A new risk of default</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>Mexico, Brazil and Argentina have
adhered to their structural reform programmes despite the side-effects &#173; on
growth and employment &#173; in order to maintain investor confidence. But, David
Pilling argues, high financing requirements could still lead them into
difficulties. A sudden outflow of capital might result in default</B> </H4> 

<P>
As the tequila crisis triggered by Mexico's devaluation of December 1994 begins
to recede into the past, Latin America is breathing more easily. So are most
holders of Latin sovereign debt, who not long ago had seen Mexico come to the
brink of default and had begun to question the sustainability of economic models
in Argentina and Brazil.

<P> Mexico, thanks to a $50 billion international rescue package spearheaded by
the US, did not default. Neither did Argentina which, with the help of a $7
billion IMF-led cash injection, stuck to its economic guns. Brazil, too, did not
waiver and has continued to consolidate gains in its battle against inflation
while pushing steadily ahead with economic reforms.

<P> Last year's crisis "tested the resilience of the region, but it withstood it
without defaulting", says Jerome Booth, head of research at ANZ Bank in London.
Governments did not swerve in their policy programmes, but went so far as to
consolidate reforms in the face of crisis. Argentina even pushed through
swingeing spending cuts and tax increases only weeks before presidential
elections in May 1995.

<P> Having seen Latin countries pass their test of fire, "we have to come to the
conclusion that the default risk is now much lower," says Booth. "In the 1980s,
it took a decade for the region to recover [from the 1982 debt crisis], during
which it had to concentrate on stabilization and crisis management, not
structural reforms."

<P> This time round, structural reforms have been hastened, while return to the
international financial markets has been incomparably quicker. "Last year, we saw
the biggest stress test these markets can go through and access to [voluntary]
international finance was closed down for the first half of 1995," says Tulio
Vera, head of sovereign debt research at Bear Stearns. "But, after six months,
the countries began to access markets again."

<P> The cost of regaining international confidence has often been high. Last
year, Mexico suffered its worst recession in 60 years, with GDP dropping some 7%
as resources were switched from domestic needs to meeting short-term debt
obligations and closing the yawning current-account deficit. Real living
standards have plummeted and more than a million Mexicans have been thrown out of
work. In Argentina, where $8 billion &#173; a huge 18% of the financial system
&#173; fled the country virtually overnight, the economy was also slammed into
deep recession by the reform programme, contracting 4.4% in 1995. Unemployment
hit record heights of 18% and social tension is increasing.

<P> There are now signs of faint economic recovery in Argentina and healthier
growth in Mexico. But such domestic hardship raises the question of whether
governments will find it politically sustainable to continue applying austerity
measures at home in the interests of maintaining investor confidence abroad.

<P> Michael Atkin, director of the Latin American department at the
Washington-based Institute of International Finance (IIF), acknowledges that
there is political pressure to default but believes this is unlikely to happen.
"It is clearly easy for a populist politician to say: 'Why are we paying, for
example, <BR> $1 million a day to greedy people in Wall Street when children are
dying of malnutrition in the slums.' But, in general, in Latin America that kind
of populism is out of fashion."

<P> "It isn't necessarily the case that you can just say you're not going to
service your foreign debt, and then take those resources and put them into a
mother-and-child nutrition scheme, making the country all of a sudden better
off," adds Atkin. "Experience shows us that this is not the case. If it were,
Latin America, which for much of the 1980s was not servicing its debt, would be
in a much better position than it is in today."

<P> ANZ's Booth agrees that the average Latin American now puts much greater
store by "getting economic policy right". That, plus the narrowing political
agenda, "means it is no longer politically sensible &#173; it never was
economically sensible &#173; to start defaulting on debt. The electorate doesn't
buy that rhetoric any more."

<P> But, as last year's crisis showed, default risk can emerge with little or no
warning. Sudden loss of confidence can provoke rapid capital outflows that can
leave the most solid-looking economy gasping for resources. "All three countries
have a vulnerability to capital flows suddenly stopping," says Geoffrey Dennis of
Bear Stearns. Business newspapers in Latin America pay as much, or more,
attention to US interest rates as to their own countries'.

<P> Bear Stearns' Vera warns: "After all, we are talking about speculative-grade
countries with ratings of BB or below. You can never categorically say about any
of them that they will not have problems servicing their debt."

<P> <B>Argentina: the price of rigidity</B>

<P> Argentine sovereign debt carries the highest risk premium of the three big
Latin economies. In mid-August, Brady bond stripped-yield spreads &#173; which
remove from the calculation the portion collateralized by US treasury bills
&#173; had Mexico at 631 basis points over T-bills, Brazil at 709bp and Argentina
at 818bp. By comparison, Venezuela, which at least until recently had been
considered the continent's economic basket case, was trading at 830bp &#173; only
18bp above Argentina.

<P> Argentina, which perhaps more than any other Latin country has stuck rigidly
to policy continuity in the face of extreme pressure, is paying the price
primarily for its currency board system, which has been in place since 1991. This
system, known locally as convertibility, pegs the peso to the dollar and prevents
the printing of local currency unless it is backed by foreign inflows.

<P> The purpose of convertibility was to ensure fiscal restraint and to restore
value to the peso, which had become worthless after two bouts of hyperinflation
in 1989 and 1990. But the side-effect is that the Argentine government is left
bereft of policy tools, whether to influence the exchange rate or the level of
interest rates. Every dollar of debt-servicing must be squeezed out of the local
economy, where the tax take has been weak because of recession, or raised in
international markets.

<P> According to recent economy ministry figures, the external debt &#173; of
which 83% is public &#173; has risen from $59 billion at the launch of
convertibility to $91.5 billion this year. Total public debt, comprising
sovereign paper held by Argentines and foreigners, has risen by a similar amount.

<P> Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's former economy minister, who was sacked in July,
says that much of this increase is accounted for by the fact that the state has
recognized debts &#173; including $13 billion in pension payments &#173; that
went unacknowledged by previous governments. On the other hand, billions of
dollars of sovereign debt was retired in the form of debt-for-equity swaps
between 1992 and 1994, when Argentina's sweeping privatization process was in
full swing.

<P> Following the tequila crisis, which brought to an end a four-year period of
rapid growth, the budget deficit has been stubbornly rising and adding to
external financing needs. Argentina has been a frequent visitor to the
international financial markets. This year alone it has raised more than $6
billion in US, Japanese and, especially, European markets. It has also depended
heavily on multilateral organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank, which financed the core of the $7 billion
bail-out package in 1995.

<P> Since mid-1995, Argentina has found it easy, if fairly costly, to access the
voluntary international markets. In 1997, partly because of the maturing of $2
billion in local Bocon bonds, debt-servicing payments will jump sharply to $14.8
billion, compared with $11.7 billion this year, according to Merrill Lynch.

<P> "There's no doubt that this could be a problem, especially if the country
risk goes up," says Roberto Alemann, a local economist. "Next year there is a
hump in amortizations and, if we add a deficit of $6 billion, at some moment
creditors are going to say: 'No, it's too risky to lend to Argentina.' "

<P> Alemann strongly advocates tackling the deficit immediately, even if it means
introducing unpopular austerity measures. In mid-August, Roque Fernandez, the new
economy minister, announced a package to do just that. A combination of tax
increases and spending cuts aims to save the treasury between $4 billion and $4.5
billion in 1997. "This will assure us continued access to international financial
markets at a reasonable cost with respect to the issuing of new debt," he says.

<P> Booth has a more sanguine attitude than Alemann but agrees that "Argentina
has a big macroeconomic problem that is not solvable in the short term ... Its
basic problem is overdependence on capital flows. The easiest solution in this
case is to attract still more capital inflows, which have grown enormously in the
past 18 months. But at some point the addict has to be weaned off. That will be a
painful process which will require raising domestic savings rates."

<P> On the bright side, Argentina's short-term debt has never reached anything
like Mexican levels. Even with the introduction this year of Letes &#173;
short-term peso-denominated debt issued domestically &#173; the proportion of
short-term debt to total obligations is only 14.3%, according to the IIF.
"Argentina's short-term debt is much smaller than Mexico's," says Shafiq Islam,
chief emerging markets strategist at Credit Suisse. "At least they have a cushion
to absorb the drying up of money."

<P> Many Argentine creditors are waiting anxiously to see whether president
Carlos Menem has the political resolve to deepen structural reforms in the face
of growing social discontent and stubbornly high unemployment. In early August,
the country was virtually paralyzed by a general strike called to protest against
the economic model.

<P> "Until congressional elections (in October 1997) there's a risk that Menem
could fiddle about at the edges of policy to try to create jobs and so on in a
way that doesn't threaten the whole programme," says Booth. "But that's not
easy."

<P> "They do have substantial gross financing needs in 1997, which will impose
serious constraints," says Atkin. "Argentina has to retain its ability to access
funds in the international markets. If they do decide to change economic policy,
they will have to keep investors fully informed."

<P> <B>Brazil: maturity problem</B>

<P> Brazil's potential problems focus not on its external debt, but on a domestic
debt that ballooned to nearly $200 billion last year as a consequence of spending
overruns and high interest rates. Of this, according to figures supplied by Bear
Stearns, R154 billion ($153 billion) is owed by the federal government and
central bank, while R45 billion has been generated by the states and
municipalities. Most worrying of all, the average maturity on this mass of debt
is a measly four months.

<P> "The short maturity situation imposes a tremendous risk that confidence will
not be there to roll over the debt," says the IIF's Atkin. "The internal debt
problem is a source of vulnerability and they need to run a tight ship on the
policy front to stop the whole thing exploding in their faces."

<P> "In Brazil the real issue is maturity. The debt to GDP ratio [total public
debt is about 38% of GDP] is one the Belgians or the Italians would die for,"
says Dennis. "The real problem is that the majority of that debt matures within
90 days."

<P> Confidence, and with it the ability to continually roll over debt, depends
mainly on the government's keeping on track the real stabilization plan. The real
plan, introduced in mid-1994, ended hyperinflation and prepared the way for the
election to the presidency of its architect, Fernando Henrique Cardoso.

<P> Maintaining the plan, which allows the real to float within a narrow band,
depends mainly on success in pushing through structural changes, analysts say.
Among these are privatization, deregulation and, crucially, the tackling of
Brazil's structural budget deficit, for which controversial amendments to the
constitution will be needed.

<P> Rudiger Dornbusch, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, recently caused consternation among Brazil-watchers by predicting
imminent economic crisis. Dornbusch, long critical of Brazil's reliance on tight
monetary policy as a weapon against inflation, said the real was overvalued by
between 30% and 40%, and as with Mexico, this carried with it the risk of a
maxi-devaluation.

<P> Dornbusch also warned that the current-account deficit was out of control and
that foreign capital, attracted by very high interest rates, could take off at
any time.

<P> Most analysts have dismissed Dornbusch's warnings as exaggerated. The real,
they say, is not nearly as overvalued as Dornbusch claims, while the
current-account deficit &#173; at 3% of GDP &#173; hardly merits comparison with
the 8% deficit that helped stoke Mexico's crisis.

<P> "Dornbusch's view that there is going to be some macro change in policy is
simply unrealistic," says Booth. "The worry was there in April of 1995 when we
began to think there was a chance of the real plan being derailed. But it didn't
happen. They stuck to their guns. Dornbusch's comments are completely off beam.
Brazil's policy continuity is extremely solid and most of the short-term worries
have now disappeared."

<P> Where Booth and others are more in agreement with Dornbusch is on the need to
tackle the root cause of inflation &#173; the failure to control public spending.
Because of Brazil's constitution, which guarantees unsustainably high budget
transfers from the federal government to the states and establishes very high
social security provisions, it is impossible to maintain a balanced budget.

<P> Last year, according to the IIF, Brazil ran a fiscal deficit of 5.5% of GDP.
"Over the longer term, they need constitutional reforms that will allow the
government to balance the budget or at least to run something closer to a
balanced fiscal position," says Atkin.

<P> Booth says that rather than provoking a serious possibility of default, the
internal debt could "tempt the Brazilians to let inflation rise in order to erode
[the debt] away". The concern is that "a build-up of inflationary pressures some
time next year could lead to slippages all over the place."

<P> But Booth believes the Brazilian economic reform process, though slow, is
irreversible. Privatizations, especially that of mining group Companhia Vale do
Rio Doce (CVRD), will be pushed through, he says, and state finances gradually
brought into line. Brazil, like Mexico and Argentina, is over the hump in its
banking crisis, which at one point threatened an unquantifiable drain on public
resources. Democracy, with its associated parliamentary battles and struggle of
interest groups, does slow the reform process, he says. "Policies are taking
longer to implement, but at the end of the day you get far sturdier results."

<P> Credit Suisse's Islam says the short-term debt situation, though of concern,
is improving. At the end of 1995, the average maturity on Brazil's internal debt
was only 2.6 months, a legacy of the country's recent hyperinflationary past. "If
they didn't default at 2.6 months, things should be better at four months," he
says. "At least it's going in the right direction."

<P> <B>Mexico: still vulnerable </B>

<P> Vera awards Mexico the highest marks of the three big Latin economies for its
recent handling of the debt issue. "In general, what we're seeing across the
region is a move towards liability management," he says. "The country that has
gone furthest in that process is clearly Mexico, doing the most innovative and
best job of streamlining its amortization profile and in managing its liabilities
most prudently."

<P> In July, Mexico announced it was pre-paying $8 billion of the US-led rescue
package, winning approval in Washington, smoothing out potential amortization
humps in 1998 and 1999, and saving an annual $125 million in interest payments.
Some $7 billion was repaid to the US treasury and $1 billion to the IMF.

<P> Mexico was able to pull off this feat largely thanks to the highly successful
issue of a $6 billion five-year note. This was doubled in size from the original
$3 billion after receiving a BBB minus investment-grade rating from Standard
&amp; Poor's &#173; the first time Mexico has ever been awarded a non-junk
rating.

<P> The BBB minus grade, on what is said to be the largest single Eurobond issue
ever, was assigned because the note was collateralized by a portion of the dollar
earnings from state petroleum company Pemex, which are to be kept in an account
in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The issue, led by JP Morgan and Swiss
Bank Corporation, carries a two-year grace period and a coupon of 200bp over
three-month Libor.

<P> This was just the most spectacular of Mexico's recent financial
re-engineerings. In April, it exchanged $1.75 billion of collateralized Brady
bonds for a 30-year dollar-denominated global bond with a yield of 552bp over US
treasuries. Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, CJ Lawrence and Salomon
Brothers managed the deal. Again, the operation lengthened the maturity of
Mexico's sovereign debt and reduced servicing costs. By swapping Bradys (which
are collateralized by zero-coupon treasury bonds) for paper carrying pure Mexican
risk, Mexico also scored a victory in its battle to regain recognition as a
reliable sovereign borrower.

<P> Finally, in August, the government said it would seek an agreement with the
IMF to lengthen the repayment schedule of $12.8 billion borrowed from the IMF at
the height of the crisis. Again, this would allow it to smooth out bunching in
its repayment schedule.

<P> "All this is very positive from the point of view of creditworthiness," says
Vera. "It makes debt holders feel much more comfortable."

<P> Of even more importance has been Mexico's tackling of its notorious Tesobono
problem. Tesobonos &#173; the dollar-indexed, short-term central bank securities
at the centre of Mexico's financial crisis &#173; were themselves the product of
a growing current-account deficit, which had been building since the early 1990s,
reaching 8% of GDP by 1994.

<P> Not surprisingly, by the beginning of 1994, investors had grown wary of
taking on Mexican currency risk. By issuing dollar-linked Tesobonos, the
government simply took that risk off their hands. The use of these securities,
now viewed as a terrible error by most analysts, was compounded by poor debt
management which allowed a significant bunching of maturities at the end of 1994.
After the bungled devaluation, when the peso entered into free fall, the Tesobono
bill ballooned and default loomed large.

<P> Islam of Credit Suisse believes foreign investors, the main holders of
Tesobonos, were as much to blame for the crisis as the Mexican authorities. "Wall
Street people missed the fact that, although the currency risk was transferred to
the Mexican government, ultimately investors assumed the (therefore higher)
default risk. If something went wrong and the Mexicans didn't have the money to
pay, then the investor would have to shoulder the burden."

<P> Lessons appear to have been learned. The US-led rescue package allowed Mexico
to redeem all its Tesobonos, no new issues of which have since been made.
"Tesobonos are dead," says Islam. "That particular problem is over."

<P> With that risk tackled, Mexican debt levels do not look too bad. According to
figures supplied by the IIF, estimated total external debt as a proportion of GDP
is 64.3%, while total debt service is equivalent to only 25.4% of exports.
Short-term debt is 25.7% of total external debt, compared with 36.8% before the
crisis broke.

<P> But ratios only give the investor a "flavour" warns Islam and never paint the
whole picture. Before the devaluation crisis, most Mexican ratios looked
healthier than those of its Latin American counterparts, he says. "If you had
been going by that, you would have had no idea. From these numbers, nobody could
have predicted a debt crisis ... Some of the ratios you look at give you some
sense, but they don't really tell you who is going to <BR> get hit."

<P> Although Mexico's ratios look pretty solid, Islam shares the concern of many
that the country remains vulnerable to a potential shock, be it external or
domestic. The devaluation crisis was unleashed by a series of political disasters
in 1994, which undermined investor confidence. These included the Zapatista
peasant revolt, the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential
candidate of the dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the
subsequent killing of PRI's secretary-general, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.

<P> "I am still concerned. The question is how vulnerable Mexico is to an
unanticipated shock because of a domestic event, such as a political
assassination, or an outside event, like a sudden rise in interest rates," says
Islam. The key to default risk, he says, is not necessarily the shock itself, but
the government's reaction to it. Mexico's response to the 1994 crisis was deeply
flawed.

<P> Booth of ANZ agrees. Mexican risk, he says, depends on the country's ability
to stick to the reform path in the face of possible adversity. This in turn will
be determined largely by the outcome of the battle at the heart of the PRI
between the "reformers and the dinosaurs". Booth believes the economic and
political reform process has probably gone far enough to continue regardless of
personality changes. In all, he regards Mexico as "a good and improving credit
story".

<P> <B>A way out</B>

<P> In the long term, analysts agree, all three countries must strive to wean
themselves off capital inflow dependency by raising their domestic savings rates.
In 1995, Brazil's savings rate was 20.3%, Argentina's 18.8% and Mexico's a
pitiful 14%, according to ING Barings. None of these comes close to the 30%-plus
rates of south-east Asia's successful economies or even Chile's 27%.

<P> In the long run, savings rates should edge up as more and more people switch
from state pay-as-you-go pension schemes to private capitalization accounts. In
Chile, private pension funds have amassed a huge pool of domestic savings which
have not only been an engine for growth but have largely isolated Santiago from
the financing traumas undergone by the rest of the continent.

<P> Until they can reach that happy state, though, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina
are likely to remain heavily dependent on borrowing. They will therefore have to
be extremely vigilant in assuring the continuation of international confidence.

<P> As Argentina has seen, though, sticking firmly to an orthodox policy path is
not necessarily enough to bring country risk down. Risk assessment, says Islam of
Credit Suisse, is a long way from rocket science. Although he remains mistrustful
of ratios, he believes there are some useful calculations to be made. Certainly,
he says, there are better measures of a country's risk than traditional stalwarts
such as import cover, which do not reflect the speed with which capital can now
be transferred. "No matter how high your reserves are, capital can still flow out
overnight."

<P> Islam puts some faith in one ratio &#173; the one that compares short-term
debt added to the current account deficit with foreign-currency reserves. This
pits the level of reserves against potentially immediate financing needs.
According to Islam's calculations, this could have provided a good indication of
the trouble waiting in store for Mexico in 1994. In that year, Mexico's ratio was
an enormous 958, against 160 for Brazil and only 101 for Argentina.

<P> Extrapolating data for 1997, Islam's ratios come up with some surprising
results. Argentina looks to be in the most solid position with 91, Brazil is
second with 163 and Mexico looks worst at 254. This order of risk is precisely
the opposite of that perceived by the market in terms of Brady bond spreads.

<P> "These ratios throw out two interesting points which go against the grain of
conventional wisdom," says Islam. "First, we can argue that Mexico has lengthened
its maturities, smoothed out its repayments and so on, but the fact remains that
its short-term debt is extremely high vis-&agrave;-vis reserves. Its situation is
better than it was, but not nearly as good as it should be."

<P> "Second, Brazil has huge reserves [of about $60 billion], but they also have
a huge amount of short-term debt. If they ran into problems they could start
losing those reserves extremely quickly."

<P> "I've been covering the debt issue since the early 1980s," says Islam. "And
one lesson I've learned is that, especially in the case of foreign-currency
denominated debt, if flows dry up and you have to make those payments, you're in
trouble. That can happen even to countries whose ratios appear to be very
solid."

 <H3>EMERGING MARKETS - <I>Edited by Brian Caplen</I></H3> 
<H2>Argentina </H2>
<H4>Failing the Mexico test </H4>
Controversy surrounds Argentina's placement of a $1 billion five-year yankee
bond in February, the first time it has managed to woo US investors since
Mexico's confidence-sapping devaluation of 1994. <BR>
<BR>
Immediately after the issue, Argentine officials declared that at last their
country had managed to differentiate itself in investors' minds from Mexico.
The bond, launched to coincide with the conclusion of a deal with the IMF,
carried a coupon of only 410 basis points above US treasuries, 35bp less
than a similarly timed Mexican placement. <BR>
<BR>
Things soon began to go wrong - the Argentine yankee widened to 570bp
and the Mexican bond narrowed to 420bp. The co-leads on the deal -
Merrill Lynch and CS First Boston - had hyped the issue, say rivals,
claiming it was oversubscribed when CSFB had a large chunk still on its
books. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The issue combined bad timing and bad management,&quot; says a US-based
debt analyst. &quot;It looked good because it was cheaper ... but it was
heavily placed with hedge funds, the type of investors looking for a quick
return. When it became clear they weren't going to get their money back
for some time, they were disappointed. The issue was hyped up and so the
disappointment was worse.&quot; <BR>
Banks involved in the deal say it was hard to read because there was little
Argentine support and several orders turned out to be less than firm. They
agree that the upshot could have been the creation of a false impression
of how well the issue was going. <BR>
<BR>
The about-turn of the US long bond also dragged the paper down, occurring
just as it came to market. But the real bone of contention was the performance
of the Argentine bond against Mexico's. David Lubin, emerging markets economist
at HSBC Markets, says: &quot;When they came out with the global bond at
410, I thought that was wrong. I don't believe Argentina should be considered
a better risk than Mexico.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Some holders of Argentine debt say that is unfair. Buenos Aires has worked
hard to demonstrate its commitment to fiscal discipline and liberal economic
reforms despite the shock dealt by Mexico's devaluation, they say. &quot;When
they were able to place the global bond for less than Mexico did, it was
a positive step,&quot; says a US bank vice-president. &quot;Maybe they were
wise to have locked in financing earlier in the year when market conditions
were more favourable.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, conditions may already be changing. There's the possibility of a
US rate hike and, domestically, the renewed outbreak in March of squabbling
between economy minister Domingo Cavallo and president Carlos Menem threatens
to raise Argentine risk as investors grow nervous about the continuance
of Cavallo's stabilizing influence. <BR>
<BR>
But Argentina needs external financing. Of the $6.5 billion it needs to
raise this year, some $3.6 billion is scheduled to come from Eurobond markets.
Officials say this could reach $5 billion. <BR>
<BR>
The consensus is that Buenos Aires, which has already raised $2 billion
internationally in 1996, will switch its attention from the US and towards
Europe and Japan for the rest. Ingrid Iversen, Latin American debt strategist
at UBS, says European markets suit Argentina better in uncertain times because
investors there tend to be less concerned about price fluctuations than
their US counterparts. &quot;The European retail market tends to care more
about the coupon and is not so sensitive about price,&quot; she says. <BR>
<BR>
The US bank vice-president agrees. &quot;A lot of European institutions
like the yield and, provided they're willing to take the dollar risk, it's
a very attractive instrument,&quot; he says. &quot;The yankee market tends
to be more [risk] ratings driven, and institutions have more restrictions
on the kinds of paper they can buy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The shift was borne out in March by a &#165;8 billion ($76 million) 10-year
samurai issue. And on March 20, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell finally placed
a previously aborted attempt to tap Dm500 million ($339 million) from the
German market at 475bp over Bunds. <BR>
<BR>
Should further opportunities arise, Argentina is likely to pounce. &quot;Its
strategy over the past two to three years has been to be as eclectic as
possible in financing,&quot; says Lubin. It has sought &quot;to create a
balanced portfolio in order to hedge, and to mirror its trading partners&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
But Lubin is among those concerned at total external debt, which the Institute
of International Finance says rose to $99 billion last year. Although only
33% of GDP, related to exports it's worrying. &quot;If there isn't a concern
about rising debt levels, there should be,&quot; says Lubin. &quot;No country
can sustain a debt/export ratio of 415% indefinitely.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the past 18 months a lot of what has kept Argentina afloat has
been very favourable external circumstances which have kept the external
accounts together,&quot; says Lubin. It managed to close its current account
deficit from $10 billion to less than $4 billion last year largely thanks
to high commodity prices, a Brazilian consumer boom, and the export advantage
of a falling dollar. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Although 1995 was, on the face of it, a very difficult year, Argentina
was helped out by circumstances which may not be true going forward,&quot;
says Lubin. <BR>
<BR>
Most traders are less glum. Iversen of UBS says: &quot;There's no growth
in debt allowed in the IMF programme [for 1996]. All the deficit is to be
covered by privatizations and all debt issuance is earmarked for amortizations.
Therefore, although the rates are high, they are improving,&quot; she says.
&quot;Argentina is one of the countries with which investors, at least in
theory, feel most comfortable.&quot; <B>David Pilling</B> <BR>

<H4>FUNDS </H4>
<H2>Keep your distance </H2>
The idea sounds simple enough. As more investors globalize their portfolios,
demand will grow for some form of convenient, one-stop global investment
vehicle: in short, a fund that invests in other funds which specialize in
particular aspects of global investment. <BR>
<BR>
A fund of emerging market country funds or a fund of regional funds, for
example, allows an investor to buy a &quot;package&quot; of expertise from
individual specialized funds. A fund of funds also lowers risk: just as
a country fund allows an investor exposure to an emerging market while reducing
worries over illiquid stocks and bureaucratic delays, so a fund of funds
distances the investor yet further. <BR>
<BR>
The fallout, if a particular market crashes, is less severe and so are the
consequences of a closed-end fund's share price falling below net asset
value (NAV) - which often happens. And existing fund-of-funds products
have recently been outperforming the country funds as an investment product
class. <BR>
<BR>
But so far, only a handful of such investment vehicles have actually come
to market. While there are over 1,400 country funds, fewer than 100 funds
of funds are traded, none of which has total assets exceeding $100 million.
There are several reasons for this. First and foremost are the strict regulations
in the US which essentially prohibit fund managers from investing their
funds in other managers' products. The SEC regulations, enacted after the
collapse and exposure of the late Bernie Cornfield's pyramid investment
schemes in the 1960s, limit broker and manager fees on funds of funds to
only 150 basis points of the selling price. <BR>
<BR>
Competition is also a factor. Many investors prefer to go with the more
familiar and more numerous global funds now on the market. And brokers tend
to encourage this, as they can collect up to three times as much commission
on global fund sales as they can under the present SEC regulations governing
commissions on funds of funds. <BR>
<BR>
But there are efforts to reform what are now seen as outdated and cumbersome
regulations, because of compelling reasons for developing more funds of
funds on both sides of the Atlantic. <BR>
<BR>
The chief reason is that they enable individual investors to globalize their
portfolios. &quot;A fund of funds gives an investor a way to invest without
having to maintain a major research effort,&quot; says David Hale, senior
vice-president and chief economist with the $70 billion, Chicago-based Zurich
Kemper Investments. &quot;In a way, it's a substitute for an index fund.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
But the investors' relief is the fund-of-funds managers' problem. Managers
point out that finding the right funds to invest in can be as difficult
as selecting an individual stock in a conventional fund. <BR>
<BR>
Chicago-based Morningstar Reserch says there are 1,312 open-end international,
international bond and 188 closed-end funds in those categories. <BR>
<BR>
Lipper Analytical Services considers a universe that includes 4,000 open-end
funds and 450 closed-end funds, excluding funds exclusively invested in
the US or the UK. The actual totals for country funds rise far higher if
Indian and Taiwanese country funds (many of which bar or discourage foreign
ownership) and eastern European privatization voucher funds are included.
<BR>
<BR>
Most fund-of-funds managers consider a much shorter list. Rupert Lea, global
product manager for country funds at ING Baring Securities, suggests that
of the 1,400 single-country funds now traded, less than 700 merit serious
consideration. Of those, approximately 360 are emerging market funds traded
in New York, London and offshore. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's a lot of cowboy stuff on the market,&quot; says Lea. He reckons,
for example, only about 10 of the 492 Russian voucher funds are worth considering.
<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, country funds are now a hot product for both investors and
fund managers. Since December 1995, price indices have shown closed-end
country funds' share prices moving from deep discount into premiums over
NAVs.One reason for this is that, as a result of the long lead time generally
required to set them up, there are insufficient new funds to meet demand.
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, funds of funds have outperformed country funds. In January, for
example, while Lipper Analytical Service's universe of 316 closed-end equity
funds had an average share price rise of 2.78%, Smith Barney's Country Fund
Opportunity Trust rose almost 10%. London-based Global Asset Management's
six emerging markets multi-manager funds' NAVs rose an average 12% in January,
against a mere 2.59% for the Lipper 316 in the same period. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, in January, these two funds of funds performed better than closed-end
country funds did over the whole of last year and, if annualized, would
have far outperformed the New York Stock Exchange's 35% rise in 1995. <BR>
<BR>
It is these returns that are causing investors and product developers to
take notice. <BR>
<BR>
Already there are several variations of funds of country funds available
offering investment alternatives. Smith Barney, for example, has its Country
Fund Opportunity Trust, which is the only pure fund of country funds available
in the US. Another option for US investors is Merriman Investment Management,
whose Asset Allocation Fund is 45% invested in international equity and
bond funds. <BR>
<BR>
British investors can buy into funds of funds through Global Asset Management,
City of London and Portfolio Trust. Global Asset Management calls its products
&quot;multi-manager&quot; funds because, as investment manager Rian Dartnell
explains: &quot;They can be funds of funds and at other times are segregated
accounts<B>.</B>&quot; There are also some offshore funds of country funds.
<BR>
<BR>
One variation of the fund of country funds concept now being explored is
world equity baskets (WEBs) which are being developed by Morgan Stanley
and Deutsche Bank. These are baskets of stocks representing a cross-section
of different countries' equity markets, akin to the S&amp;P 500 or the DJI
indices. Some 17 countries will be represented in Morgan Stanley's WEB and
nine countries in the Deutsche Bank product, both of which await final SEC
approval. <BR>
<BR>
The universe of fund-of-funds products will continue to grow as they continue
to offer competitive returns to investors who need to globalize their portfolios.
&quot;We will see more funds of funds because asset allocation is very important,&quot;
says Paul Merriman, founder and president of Merriman Investment Management.
&quot;To build a client base, mutual fund managers will need to develop
funds that represent true asset allocation. Ultimately, asset allocation
will become more important than market timing or stock selection.&quot;

<H4>LATIN AMERICAN DERIVATIVES </H4>
<H2>Exposure control </H2>
Latin derivatives are booming as more players use them to shield themselves
from currency and interest rate exposure. The Latin American derivatives
market grew fast in the years before the Mexican devaluation of 1994, but
the ability of the local exchanges to provide liquidity in the underlying
stocks was severely tested when the crisis struck and the market lost momentum.
<BR>
<BR>
The flip side of the peso scare, however, has been a heightened concern
for managing currency risk in the region. This has created a demand for
new instruments, on which US and Latin exchanges are trying to capitalize.
<BR>
<BR>
Last year, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) launched peso future contracts
in April and real future contracts in November. The response to both has
exceeded expectations. At the beginning of March, the average daily volume
for the peso product was between 2,000 and 3,000 contracts. While the recent
stability of the real has negatively affected the trading of this currency's
product, average daily volume is still reasonable, says Michael Gohrman,
vice-president international development at the CME, and reached an average
of about 800 contracts over the same period. The CME says these two have
been its fastest-growing currency products ever and it is about to launch
two new instruments, with the aim of listing three products for each Latin
American currency some time in the near future. <BR>
<BR>
On March 26, the CME listed four Brady Bond futures and options index contracts.
But this is not the first Brady Bond index to be launched by an exchange.
Finex listed one last November and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has
launched its own index since then. Neither has been very successful, however,
so many wonder if CME's will be any different. CME's Gohrman explains that
while the Finex index offers assorted Bradys from different countries and
the CBOT index has combined Bradys from within a country, the CME index
will offer specific Bradys within a country, such as the Argentine floating
rate bonds (FRBs), Mexican par bonds, Brazilian &quot;C&quot; bonds and
eligible interest bonds (EIs). &quot;This is what investors want,&quot;
says Gohrman. Each CME Brady bond contract will be dollar-denominated and
cash-settled. The futures contract value will be $500 multiplied by the
contract price, with expirations in March, June, September and December.
<BR>
<BR>
Last month, the CME, in conjunction with the CBOT, also announced an agreement
with the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV - the Mexican stock exchange),
to list the BMV stock index, the IPC, in late April. The CME has also had
discussions with the Brazilian and Argentine stock exchanges to licence
their Bovespa and Merval indexes. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, local exchanges are reviving projects delayed during the peso
crisis. With the exception of Brazil whose futures exchange, the Bolsa de
Mercadorias e Futuros, is the envy of its neighbours, often trading up to
30,000 contracts a day, other Latin American countries have not yet been
able to make these products take off. In Mexico, the BMV only offers warrants
but is currently working to create a standardized market for derivatives
that would include options and futures on price indices, foreign exchange
and interest rates. &quot;We know the interest is there,&quot; says Mario
Delfino Solano, coordinator of the project at the Bolsa. <BR>
<BR>
The Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, on the other hand, has enlisted the help
of the CBOT to develop a futures and options market. &quot;We've got more
and more institutional investors who need hedging instruments,&quot; says
Hugo Medina, corporate finance officer at the Argentine exchange. <BR>
<BR>
Like its neighbours, Chile is rethinking the strategy for its existing options
and futures market, which has zero volume. &quot;We are also considering
launching new products and possibly hiring an international consulting company
to help us do this effectively,&quot; says Carlos Niedbalski, deputy director
of custody and derivatives at the Santiago Stock Exchange. <BR>
<BR>
Will these plans pose a threat for US exchanges? It's not likely, says the
CME's Gohrman: &quot;To a large extent, local players will use the local
markets and what we are looking at are international players who might not
yet be willing to use them. Also, at least temporarily, we could create
arbitrage possibilities between the two and that could help bolster volume
at both places.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The over-the-counter market has also been prospering. Investment banks such
as Morgan Stanley, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, ING, JP
Morgan, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers have all been actively structuring
hedges for their clients in the past year. Although the products offered
by exchanges may be useful on a day-to-day risk management basis, the advantage
of structured deals, such as cross-currency interest swaps, convertibility
options and cash-flow currency hedging is clear. &quot;You can almost precisely
tailor the products to your needs,&quot; says Hari Hariharan, managing director
at Santander World Investments in New York. <BR>
<BR>
There are other advantages to dealing with a major bank, argues Carlos Cervetti,
vice-president at ING in New York. &quot;We can get a much bigger size done
here and liquidity is sometimes a problem at the CME.&quot; Cervetti says
average deals can go from $5 million to over $50 million on any particular
trade. <BR>
<BR>
Although it is true that up to now mainly banks and funds have bought these
instruments, corporate treasuries are taking an interest. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever their present shortcomings, the Latin derivatives markets will
develop inevitably, says Hariharan. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's almost like a sociological phenomenon. There are US fund managers
taking money into these markets, who have got used to techniques and tactics
available in their own markets. So when they go down south, they want to
know how many of these are available and that creates a customer's need
for some of the suppliers.&quot; After all, the Latin Americans have an
advantage, argues Hariharan. &quot;There have been so many accidents along
the way that they can learn from them.&quot; <B>Mariana Crespo</B> <BR>

<H4>THAILAND </H4>
<H2>It's tough to be cool </H2>
<H4>Thailand's reputation as one of the more deregulated south-east Asian
financial centres appeared to take a knock last month when a tax on currency
swaps was proposed. </H4>
This was one of a number of proposed deterrents to strong capital inflows,
which are making it difficult for the Bank of Thailand (BoT) to manage the
monetary base. Economists sympathize with the BoT's predicament, but argue
that such a tax would be a long-lasting solution to a short-term problem.
It would raise the cost of funding for local companies and change the tax
regime. <BR>
<BR>
Amidst a flurry of phone calls from concerned foreign investors and financiers
to their Bangkok contacts, the BoT tried to play down fears. A BoT executive
said they were &quot;just tossing ideas around&quot;. Possibly the aim of
the discussions was to try to cool inflows by threat. <BR>
<BR>
At first there was confusion as to whether the proposal referred to simple
transactions between baht and other currencies or was a tax on interest
rate swaps between US dollars and baht. Bankers concluded it meant the latter
but still differed over whether tax would be levied on the full value of
the principal or on the swap premium.<B> </B>With a premium of over 300
basis points (the difference between a 6% interest rate on dollars and 9.45%
on comparable baht) for both two- and five-year swaps, there's plenty of
room for the authorities to move in. <BR>
<BR>
According to a report put out by the Thai Farmers Research Centre, the tax
talked about would be on swap premiums when a swap linked to a non-resident
baht account is made. &quot;The objective of the tax measures is to narrow
the interest rate gaps, thereby making interest rate arbitrage less profitable
for foreign investors,&quot; it said. <BR>
<BR>
Confirming the view that the discussion was more about cooling markets than
restraining them, the report added: &quot;Regardless of the outcome, we
believe the proposal is as strong as it can be at signalling to the market,
both foreign investors and domestic financial institutions alike, that the
authorities are determined to slow down the flows of such short-terms funds.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Other observers, however, took the idea at face value and warned of the
dangers. A London-based bank treasurer said that Thai companies would face
higher funding costs. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;They really want short-term measures and if you start mucking around
with the revenue code its long-term,&quot; says Stuart Simons, tax manager
at SGVN Legal and Tax Consultants, part of Arthur Andersen. Simons says
the BoT proposed the swap tax but the suggestion was thrown out by the ministry
of finance (MoF). <BR>
<BR>
Other measures considered to slow the economy included increasing the reserve
requirements on non-resident accounts, putting a limit on how quickly newly
arrived capital could leave, and stipulating a hedging requirement on all
forex transactions. <BR>
<BR>
Simons had a number of calls from overseas clients worried about the measures.
Hong Kong investors were particularly concerned about a further suggestion
of an increase in withholding tax on bills of exchange. <BR>
<BR>
A 10% withholding tax is imposed on the discount for bills of exchange,
if they are issued to non-resident financial institutions in countries with
a double-taxation agreement with Thailand. Otherwise they are subject to
a 15% withholding tax. The suggestion seems to be to standardize the 15%
level across the board, says Simons. <BR>
<BR>
A central bank monetary policy committee has been assigned to look into
the whole question of controlling the economy, says the BoT executive. &quot;We
are looking at ways of coping [with capital inflows].&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The big problem for the Thai authorities is that they want to maintain the
exhange rate of the baht against the dollar. But the problem is that when
Thai interest rates are higher than US ones, foreign funds are sucked in
- attracted by higher yields with a minimum of currency risk. The domestic
bond market is too thin for the inflows to be fully sterilized by issuing
government securities although this is being attempted. That's why the authorities
have been so inventive in considering alternatives. <B>Gill Baker</B>

<B>Amount: $4.05 billion</B> <BR>
<B>Launched: March 11</B> <BR>
<B>Lead manager: Morgan Stanley</B> <BR>
<BR>
They managed it, but only just. In early March, GPA sold $4.05 billion of
asset-backed global bonds, hauling the company back from the brink just
weeks before directors at the Irish-based aircraft leasing company would
probably have been forced to apply for receivership. <BR>
<BR>
The issue, one of the largest and most complicated bonds ever sold outside
the government sector, capped 18 months of intensive negotiations. Right
up to the wire it looked as if the deal could fail, with one creditor refusing
to agree to details of the restructuring. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;All human life was in this deal,&quot; said John Tierney GPA's chief
financial officer. Alongside the securitization, the company had to settle
litigation, reschedule aircraft orders, and sell off loss-making subsidiaries.
Failure to complete any of these could have scuppered the deal. <BR>
<BR>
<B>C</B>hannelled through special purpose vehicle, Airplanes Group, the
$4.05 billion bond issue parcelled up cashflow from 229 airplanes owned
by GPA in the first-ever securitization of rental income from airplane leases.
The proceeds from the issue allowed the company to pay down $2.9 billion
of bank and secured debt as well as to raise new money for operating purposes
and to pre-fund further debt payments. Although the first slug of debt didn't
actually fall due until September 1997, Irish company law requires directors
to take a view on company solvency over an 18-month period. Failing to complete
the Airplanes financing by June would have forced the GPA board to apply
for examination, Ireland's form of receivership. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It was this deal or examination, more or less,&quot; says Karl Essig,
a managing director at Morgan Stanley, GPA's adviser and underwriter of
the bond issue. <BR>
<BR>
The wings almost fell off the deal right at the end, when the Pennsylvania-based
Public School Employees' Retirement System (PSERS) refused to agree to details
of the restructuring. A noted hardball player in fund management circles,
PSERS was holding out for better terms on a $100 million chunk of second
preference shares it had bought in an earlier GPA refinancing. The preference
shares were not directly included in the restructuring and, on any valuation,
were worth far less than their face value. <BR>
<BR>
PSERS held a trump card for its high-stakes poker game with the company
and its advisers: around $40 million of secured notes. That class of debt
was included in the refinancing along with the bank lines, and, for the
deal to go ahead, all holders had to sign. <BR>
<BR>
Even if GPA wanted to strike a deal with PSERS it couldn't have done so;
the company had always stressed that a cardinal feature of the restructuring
was that all creditors remained in the same relative position as before,
after the deal had been done. Cutting a deal with PSERS would have laid
the company open to accusations of favourable treatment from other classes
of creditors. <BR>
<BR>
After weeks of mounting tension the clash finally broke into the open on
February 6 when GPA issued a press-release outlining the bleak future for
the company if PSERS continued to hold out on the restructuring. A few days
of increasingly fierce negotiations between Morgan Stanley and PSERS led
to the impasse finally being broken on February 16. Lazard Fr&egrave;res
bought out the PSERS-held preference shares at 25 cents in the dollar, and
all of the secured note-holders received a fee for surrendering the convertible
element of their stakes. <BR>
<BR>
That agreement cleared the way for the Airplane deal to fly. &quot;After
that, all we had left to do was sell $4 billion of bonds,&quot; says Essig
who had co-headed the Morgan Stanley effort from the start, along with Scott
Bok, a managing director in the firm's restructuring and mergers and acquisitions
department. Key players at GPA included Tierney and Patrick Blaney, who
had been elevated to chief executive during the 1993 refinancing. <BR>
<BR>
It was the new GPA management team that hired Morgan Stanley to construct
a long-term financing plan for the company back in August 1994. Following
an abortive IPO in 1992, GPA had been rescued by GE Capital of the US, which
bought 35 planes from the company at a cost of $1.3 billion. GE also took
over the management of the GPA fleet as well as acquiring an option to buy
a majority stake in the company until March 1998, since extended until October
2001. <BR>
<BR>
The 1993 GE intervention averted impending disaster, but it didn't promise
the company a long-term future. &quot;It was an uneasy alliance between
various classes of creditors and new investors,&quot; said Tierney. &quot;It
was at best a breathing space.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The GPA board could not assume that GE would exercise its option, and so
needed a refinancing plan that would take the company beyond 1998. <BR>
<BR>
Once the banks had been corralled into a one-year debt extension, GPA and
Morgan Stanley examined six alternative long-term plans, including further
bank refinancing and a high-yield bond issue. One by one, all were discarded,
except the securitization of most of the company. &quot;It seemed an outrageous
idea at the time,&quot; says Tierney. &quot;But the more we examined it,
the more it seemed to make sense.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>M</B>organ Stanley's Essig explains that the company had strong cash-streams
flowing from its aircraft portfolio; its problem was that the maturity of
its liabilities didn't match, and nor could they be made to - save by securitization.
Hence began Project Atlanta, the template that was fashioned into the Airplanes
Group. <BR>
<BR>
Securitization wasn't entirely new to GPA - it had parcelled up and sold
aircraft via two aircraft lease portfolio securitization (ALPS) transactions
in the past - but this one was different. <BR>
<BR>
All previous aircraft securitizations had depended on eventual sale of the
underlying aircraft to pay off principal; this structure was created in
order to harness the income stream from the leases themselves, allowing
the vehicle to realize more of the value of the portfolio. (Aircraft sales
are necessarily a lumpy process and the rating agencies assume that each
plane may be sold at the bottom of a business cycle. Rental rates go up
and down as well, of course, but agencies can price in the expected upswings
as well as the downturns.) <BR>
<BR>
By December 5, most of the legal and tax issues had been addressed and the
Airplanes structure had been sufficiently honed to allow an SEC filing.
A Morgan Stanley-led syndicate of 17 banks launched the issue on March 11,
following a two-week worldwide roadshow . <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It was a buyers' market,&quot; says one syndicate member. &quot;It
was a deal that had to get done.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But for fair pricing, don't read rip-off for the issuer. Structuring the
issue and selling it into the capital markets allowed GPA to realize 87%
of the market value of the Airplanes portfolio, as against 75% advanced
by the banks and the secured note-holders. <BR>
<BR>
For that financial alchemy Morgan Stanley received fees estimated at between
$30 million and $40 million. <p>

<H3>CHINA</H3>


<H2> <B>Playing Chinese bond games</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>The first interest rate cut
in five years has helped to boost the Chinese bond market, which is being
reformed and currently enjoying a good run. But there are still problems. The
market is relatively new and lacks experienced traders. More worryingly, the
government closed down the futures market after Wanguo Securities crashed because
of a bad speculation. Although China is keen to have foreign investors in the
market, it says this won't happen until the reforms are completed &#173; which it
estimates will take several years. Sophie R&ouml;ell reports</B> </H4> 

<P>
China's government bond market is booming. In July alone, some Rmb 220 billion
($26.5 billion) worth of bonds changed hands on the Shanghai Stock Exchange
&#173; bringing the total turnover for the year to Rmb557 billion. In addition,
this year there have been some Rmb175.2 billion ($21 billion) in new issues
&#173; bringing the total value of bonds issued by China's ministry of finance up
to Rmb570 billion. Modest by international standards, perhaps, but impressive in
a country where only three years ago the government funded most of its deficit by
printing money.

<P> The driving force behind the boom has been an interest rate cut by the
People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, on May 1 &#173; the first in
five years. Dai Xianglong, the bank's governor, hinted that if inflation remained
under control a further cut would follow later in the year.

<P> Banks and securities houses seem confident that, with China's bond market now
growing rapidly in size, the underwriting of and trading in government bond
issues will be a profitable line of business in the future. In the process, the
system is being reformed from one where bonds were non-tradeable and distributed
by administrative placement to one which resembles international practice.

<P> Several securities companies specializing in bonds have already been set up,
such as the Shanghai Securities Finance Company. Other securities houses are in
the process of establishing specialist departments to run their bond business,
rather than just dealing with it in a general securities department.

<P> The focus of this activity is the Shanghai Stock Exchange, where over 80% of
China's government bonds are traded. Trading activity and investor interest in
the stock market has spilled over into bonds &#173; boosting bond market
liquidity and turning Shanghai into the country's principal government bond
market.

<P> "People are in the process of changing their focus from the very speculative
stock market to the quite stable bond market," says Liu Shi An, deputy manager of
the T-bill and futures department at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Market
participants, disillusioned by the wild ups and downs in China's stock market,
are finding bonds a more secure form of investment.

<P> <B>Under the hammer</B>

<P> The main players in the market are the so-called "primary dealers" &#173; the
Chinese equivalent of the UK's market-makers, as one ministry of finance official
describes them. These now total 30 and include both banks and securities houses.
For any one issue, primary dealers have to underwrite a minimum of 1% of the
total amount. (It will take some time for their role to evolve into
market-markets as we know them; at the moment they are really just a central
government-approved group of underwriters.)

<P> One major change in China's bond market this year has been reform of the
underwriting process. Previously, interest rates were set by the ministry of
finance, usually at one or two percentage points higher than the bank deposit
savings rate. Only in the secondary market did supply and demand actually play a
role.

<P> But this year auctioning was introduced in the primary market: both on the
interest rate (in the case of bonds issued at par), and on the issuing price (in
cases where the ministry of finance set the coupon). Banks have so far played a
leading role in the auction process &#173; led by the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC) and China Construction Bank, which dominate local currency
deposit-taking and lending in China. Securities houses point out that only banks
have the financial muscle to buy up issues before placing them, and so can offer
more attractive deadlines for taking issues off the hands of the ministry of
finance.

<P> After an issue is fully underwritten, underwriters choose where they want to
list the bond. In Shanghai the primary dealers and the bonds allocated to them
are registered in the trading system for sale to a select group of brokers: the
98 or so approved "secondary" dealers. Twenty days later the bond is actually
listed and secondary market trading begins. Two of the most recent issues,
however, were so popular that primary dealers refused to sell them on to other
dealers. One was a 10-year issue in July, the first of that maturity to be
offered since China started reissuing bonds in the early 1980s; only one or two
sales of bonds took place during the 20-day period.

<P> Once the bonds are listed on the exchanges, brokers will trade both bonds and
stocks from the same stock exchange seat. Banks are barred from dealing in stocks
and so have "special" seats at the exchange confined to bond trading.

<P> If banks have so far led underwriting, secondary market trading is dominated
by securities firms. This is partly because of historical circumstance: before a
commercial banking law was passed last year, banks were not allowed to
participate in the bond market.

<P> But it is also a question of demand. Because the coupon rate on bonds is
typically higher than the bank deposit rate set by the state, banks have found
holding bonds a profitable way of earning interest on their funds without the
risk associated with lending to China's state-owned sector. The biggest trader in
the secondary market is China's largest brokerage, Shenyin Wanguo. Although this
year it underwrote only Rmb6.2 billion of some Rmb110 billion auctioned by the
ministry of finance, its share of bond trading has remained steady at between 12%
and 15%. Last year, some 40% of the company's profits were from bond trading.
Other securities companies, such as Guotai, are also starting to play a
significant role.

<P> Trading hours are the same as for the stock market: 9.30&#173;11.30am;
1&#173;3pm. Commission charged per transaction by the Shanghai Stock Exchange is
0.01%; brokerages are in turn allowed to charge a maximum of 0.3% to their
clients. Trades &#173; which are in minimum lots of Rmb1,000 &#173; are matched
automatically by computer, on the basis of price and then time priority.

<P> China's bond market is a relatively new one and, not surprisingly, most of
the traders on the floor do not have a long bond-trading track record. Most are
young, university graduates with degrees in international finance from Shanghai
universities. Before they can start trading they have to complete a one-month
intensive course organized by the Shanghai Stock Exchange and pass an exam.

<P> On the trading floor, bond traders take account of a number of "fundamentals"
&#173; as one trader puts it &#173; to determine which way the market will move.
The only limit the Shanghai Stock Exchange sets is that one transaction cannot
move the market more than 10% up or down from the preceding one.

<P> Top "fundamentals" traders look out for include:

<P> <B>*</B> <I>A movement in the interest rate set by the central bank on all
bank deposits</I>. In August, there was a massive rally in all bonds when the
Shanghai market was abuzz with rumours that the central bank would cut interest
rates by as much as 1.5%. Two days before the cut was announced, China's only
10-year bond rose 5% in a single day, with a record turnover level of Rmb14.9
billion on the Rmb25 billion issue. A three-year bond, issued this year, closed
3% higher.

<P> <B>*</B> <I>The inflation subsidy</I>. Before May this year, all bonds came
equipped not only with a coupon, but also with a subsidy, calculated according to
the level of the retail price inflation index;  this was designed to compensate
investors for erosion in the value of bonds as a result of inflation. With
inflation now under control this subsidy has been abolished for new issues.
However, there are two five-year bonds, one issued in 1992 and the other in 1993,
which are still eligible for the subsidy. "Each month there will still be
announcements on the subsidy rate, which has a very direct correlation with the
price movement of these bonds," says  Jia Yu Yao, at Shenyin Wanguo
Securities<B>.</B> Predicting what the subsidy will be is a critical art.

<P> <B>*</B> <I>Volume of new issues</I>. With only eight issues currently in the
market, new issuance has a significant effect on supply and demand of  bonds.
China's ministry of finance has been criticized for not providing the market with
a pre-announced year-round schedule for issuance, although the total issuance for
the year is usually announced in March after the year's budget is approved by the
National People's Congress, China's parliament. However, traders say that it is
possible to calculate the likely timing of new issues. According to Shenyin's
Jia: "We have historical data to go on. For example, we knew that in August the
government had a very large amount to repay &#173; because around Rmb30 billion
in bonds matured that month. So in June and July we predicted that in August
there would be a new issue, to repay the older debts. And in August there was a
new issue."

<P> Traders say the bond market is far less subject to volatility and speculative
activity than China's stock markets. Investors like to buy bonds and then hold on
to them for the coupon and repayment at the end. Bond market analysts also point
out that the much larger size of bond issues makes it much harder to manipulate
the market in the same way as traders have the equity market, where listed
companies are typically fairly small in size.

<P> However, to paint China's bond market as free from ramping would be
misleading. "People will try and make the price go up and down, just as in the
equity markets," says one trader.

<P> The most lucrative activity is, of course, getting inside information on the
central bank's plans: on the setting of the interest rate and the inflation
subsidy.

<P> As one trader confesses: "Our boss has a very good relationship with the
PBOC, and last year he found out before the market did what the inflation rate
subsidy would be on a three-year bond in the market. So he bought a large sum of
these T-bills and made a lot of money." But for Wanguo Securities, however,
speculative activity based on expectations of PBOC's inflation rate subsidy
announcement ended in disaster. The company lost its entire capital in the bond
futures market after the subsidy turned out to be different from what it had
anticipated. The bond futures market was closed down after the scandal.

<P> Such speculative activities are hard for the stock exchange to control. What
it is in the process of trying to make impossible, however, is short-selling.
Both paperless and physical bonds are traded on the Shanghai exchange. If a sell
order for a paperless bond is placed and there is no bond in the account, the
order is automatically rejected by the computer. With paper bonds, short-selling
is discovered only after trading at time of settlement, and has to be cancelled
then. Also for paper bonds, custody is by seat &#173; making it hard for the
exchange to determine if short-selling is taking place at an account level. The
exchange is in the process of centralizing custody over paper bonds to close this
loophole, but warns that this will be a massive operation and take some time to
complete.

<P> Fortunately, the ministry of finance is trying to issue more and more of its
bonds in scripless form, particularly shorter-term bonds. This will also have the
advantage of broadening potential investor demand for bonds outside Shanghai; the
inconvenience of delivering physical bonds has tended to confine bond trading
activity to Shanghai.

<P> This may raise the profile of STAQS (Securities Trading Automated Quotation
System), established in 1990, which provides a satellite link with real-time
prices to dealers across China. Although government bond trading started on
STAQS, its role now is largely that of acting as a branch of the Shanghai
exchange. Says Lu Wei Ming at Guotai Securities: "You can buy through STAQS, but
the trade really happens on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."

<P> However, brokers warn that one disadvantage of moving to scripless form is
that investors who want to buy and hold bonds tend to prefer physical evidence of
their investments, and may not be so keen to buy scripless bonds. "People are
very conservative," says Guotai's Lu.

<P> Although the Shanghai Stock Exchange has become dominant in trading in
government bonds, some bonds are also listed on the country's other major stock
exchange in Shenzhen. For example, of July's 10-year issue, 90% was listed in
Shanghai and the rest in Shenzhen. Trading in Shenzhen tends to be thinner and
days can go by with hardly any fluctuation in the price of a bond. The different
supply and demand profiles in the two markets mean the same bond will trade at
different prices in each market.

<P> However, in the absence of a central custodian in China, the arbitrage
opportunities between the two markets are limited. According to Shenyin's Jia:
"If you buy the bond in Shanghai and then want to sell it on the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange, custody will happen only three days later. By then the price will have
changed. So although arbitraging is theoretically possible, in practice it
isn't."

<P> This is changing, however. In a programme sponsored by the Asian Development
Bank, China's ministry of finance has invited Cedel to build up a central
depositary in China. Preliminary work has begun, and the ministry of finance aims
to have a central custodian in place by the end of the year.

<P> China has two over-the-counter bond trading centres: one in Wuhan (on the
Yangtze River), and the other in Tianjin (close to Beijing). Both are currently
undergoing what traders tactfully refer to as restructuring.

<P> <B>Risky repos</B>

<P> Lack of adequate supervision over the repurchase market apparently caused the
central bank to step in; it also led to a sharp decline in trading in the bonds
as well. Trading centres had apparently been trying to attract business by
lowering the percentage of the bond which had to be mortgaged in the repo market.

<P> "According to the requirements of the ministry of finance, if you're buying a
repo  you need 100% of the real bond in custody," says Shenyin's Jia. "But these
trading centres lowered this ratio &#173; so this is very risky."

<P> The attention the regulatory authorities are paying to the repo market is
well founded. Shenzhen has no repo market, but in Shanghai, in step with the
increase in bond trading this year, repo market volumes have soared. In the first
seven months of this year Rmb 328 billion in repos were traded &#173; accounting
for nearly half total stock exchange turnover.

<P> Since the repo market has helped stimulate liquidity in China's bond market,
it seems unlikely that the bond futures market will be allowed to reopen again in
the near future. With the bond market booming, the need for a futures market does
not seem urgent.

<P> "Originally, the purpose of bond futures was to try to stimulate the
liquidity of bond cash trading, which it did achieve," says Vivian Lee, of the
Shanghai exchange's T-bill department. "But after the suspension of the futures
market, the cash market has remained quite active, and liquidity just keeps going
up."

<P> Brokers are cautious, however, about the effects of the lack of a hedging
instrument if interest rates start rising again &#173; particularly as regards
the underwriting process.

<P> "If there was a futures market, underwriters can hedge their position," says
one broker. "At the moment we can live without that, because we expect interest
rates to go down. But if interest rates are maintained at the same level, and
there is no likelihood of a reduction, then I think futures will probably be
necessary."

<P> In fact, reopening the futures market is one of the essential preconditions
the ministry of finance laid down before the bond market is opened up to foreign
investors. According to a ministry of finance official, once the renminbi is
fully convertible the domestic bond market will be opened up to investors as soon
as there is a properly functioning futures market, foreign firms have become
primary dealers &#173; or are at least working together with Chinese primary
dealers &#173; and the market has been linked up with Cedel or Euroclear.

<P> Although ministry of finance officials say they are keen to attract
foreigners investors, as soon as these conditions have been met, they also warn
that they will proceed "slowly but surely, so that we do not create any market
repercussions".

<P> This means the bond market is likely to be closed to foreigners for "at least
a couple of years", according Gao Jian, who heads the ministry of finance's state
debt management department.

<P> In the meantime, the ministry of finance will have to spend some time
clearing up remaining anomalies in the issuance system. As one PBOC official
points out, even this year "not every bond issue has had its interest rate set by
the market". The main exception was a Rmb30 billion non-tradeable five-year
issue, placed via traditional methods through the banking system, and sold
largely to individual investors.

<P> That, according to PBOC officials, puts a "heavy burden" on the state-owned
banks, which are not allowed to trade the bonds if they do not sell well and have
to hold them until they are due if investors wish to redeem them before they
reach maturity. Not surprisingly, in contrast to the other bond issues this year,
the five-year issue did not sell particularly well.

<P> One danger is that if interest rates go up again, and securities houses and
institutions adopt a more cautious approach to buying up bonds, the ministry of
finance will, if necessary, revert to more traditional methods of issuance to
raise money.

<H3> <B>Petronas triumphs with $1.9bn global bond issue</B> </B>
</H3> <P> <H4><B>MALAYSIAN NATIONAL oil company
Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas) took the international debt markets by storm
this week, launching a $1.9bn three-tranche global bond.</H4></B>The transaction for
the A+/A1 rated company - regarded by many as Asia's top corporate credit and a
close surrogate for Malaysian sovereign risk - is the second largest global
corporate bond on record, following Walt Disney's $2.6bn two-tranche financing
earlier this year.

<P> The three-tranche issue was finalised at $1.9bn yesterday (Thursday),
following a pre-pricing increase of $400m in the face of overwhelming demand from
investors in the US and Europe.

<P> Having initially been indicated in a range of $500m-$1bn, lead managers CS
First Boston and Salomon Brothers launched the deal on Wednesday at a much
larger-than-expected size of $1.5bn.

<P> The success of the transaction stunned most observers. But the deal's
handling did not draw universal praise from syndicate members. Some bankers
complained of clients being deterred by the huge increase in the size and the
patchy information on the deal's progress from the leads.

<P> But there is little doubt that the deal's blow-out success merited such an
increase, with the lead managers both claiming that overall orders for bonds had
amounted to between $4bn-$5bn.

<P> At a stroke, the Petronas financing has established a clear benchmark for
Asian credits in the international bond markets, with tranches of five, 10 and
30-year debt all attracting widespread demand from investors.

<P> In total, $600m was raised in five-year paper with a spread of 38bp over
Treasuries, $800m (increased from $600m) in 10-year paper at 57bp over and $500m
of 30-year debt (a new tranche, upped from $300m) at 85bp over.

<P> Co-leads taking books of $18m each on the five year and $24m on the 10 year
were ABN AMRO, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Lehman and Rashid Hussain, with
co-managers on books of $6m for the five year and $8m for the 10 year comprising
Daiwa, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, Nomura, Paribas and SBC Warburg.

<P> There was no group for the 30-year portion, from which syndicate members
estimated the two leads made fees of 87.5bp apiece.

<P> In terms of pricing, the five-year tranche with an A+/A1 rating achieved a
spread 10bp inside the levels at which similar credits such as Ford Motor Company
have recently placed paper.

<P> "This is the core Asian holding," said one banker, "and with its sovereign
backing, buying Petronas is equivalent to pure Malaysian risk. Investors were
also made aware during the extensive roadshow process that on a stand-alone basis
the strength of the company's fundamentals would rate it a good double-A."

<P> With its past borrowings concentrated in the Yankee market, the group was
said to be keen to diversify into Europe where about 50 first-time accounts
picked up five-year paper, with one account taking $25m and the remainder buying
tickets of $10m and under.

<P> The 10 year and 30-year tranches, by contrast, were predominantly placed with
high-quality US institutional investors.

<P> "The quality of accounts in this transaction is just staggering," said one of
the lead managers. "When we were roadshowing in the US, investors also began to
ask us about the possibility of a longer tenor and we decided to include one at
the beginning of this week. In total we ended up with a book of about $1.5bn for
the 30 year, so in comparison to the level of demand a $200m increase was a mere
drop in the ocean."

<P> Other syndicate officials also reported heavy levels of oversubscription --
although some pointed to poorer-than-expected demand from Asia. Said one: "We
were four times oversubscribed on the five-year and three times on the 10 year,
though there was minimal interest from Asia. The spread was just that little bit
too tight for the region's mainly bank investors and most of our paper for the
shorter maturity went into Switzerland and the Benelux. On the 10 year, demand
was led from the UK and US."

<P> The banker added: "Overall it is a fantastic transaction. The leads went just
the right way about presenting the deal and it should perform extremely well in
the secondary market, allowing Petronas to issue at much tighter levels in the
future."

<P> However, one syndicate member contested that view, arguing that the decision
to increase the deal had alienated some investors and that the lead managers had
hogged the transaction.

<P> "If there had been so much demand then the proper course of action would have
been for a smaller increase and tighter spread," he said. "Instead the leads got
too greedy, but they made matters worse by not informing the market of what was
going on. It wasn't until 15 minutes before the issue was due to be priced that
they announced the increase and then delayed pricing for over another hour."

<P> In terms of client reaction to the increase, syndicate members responses'
ranged from ready acceptance to outright fury. Said one: "We did have some
cancelled orders for the 10-year tranche, but the outright strength of demand
more than made up for it. Petronas is clearly a very strong story and attracted
investors across all sectors and every continent."

<P> But as one other banker put it: "Throughout the roadshow period the company
was emphasising that it has very little debt and very little need of any. Why
then borrow such a huge amount? We were initially allocated $5m in the 10-year
tranche and had two orders right from the beginning of the marketing period: one
for $3m and one for $2m. The $3m client was absolutely furious at the extent of
the increase believing that there will be too much loose paper and spread
widening."

<P> On breaking syndicate at 5.30pm London time, initial evidence showed the deal
to be holding its own with secondary market bids at the re-offer for all three
tranches.

<P> A London-based banker concluded: "To my knowledge Petronas is the first
non-US corporate to construct a full yield curve like this. It now has five,
nine, 10, 20 and 30-year paper in the market."

<P> Many also added that the sheer size of the deal and clamour for paper had
easily overshadowed Petronas' hugely successful transaction of autumn 1995. Led
by CS First Boston, this comprised $375m in 10-year paper at 69bp over Treasuries
and $625m in 20-year paper at 86bp over.

<P> * Earlier this week <B>Tenaga Nasional Berhad</B>, Malaysia's national
electricity company, also outlined its funding plans for the remainder of 1996
and through 1997 in a move to stem criticism stemming from an embarrassing
14-hour national power cut in early August.

<P> New chairman Ahmad Tajuddin Ali said that the group had earmarked $1.6bn for
1996, increasing to $2bn during 1997, to fund upgrades and expansion of the
utility's generation, transmission and distribution capabilities.

<P> He added that he was not in favour of tariff increases and believes that a
consultancy study undertaken by the UK's National Grid will not favour a break-up
of Tenaga's monopoly.

<P> The study, to be completed at the end of October, was ordered by the
government following August's blackout.

<P> Ali said that the group intended to raise $1bn from the international capital
markets during 1997 and was studying various financing proposals from investment
banks.

<H4>The German capital markets are changing. Monetary union in Europe by
1999 is fading, money-market rates have fallen and internationalization
is the buzzword. The bond market has been motoring - until the recent downturn.
Does this signal a change in longer-term investor sentiment? Philip Moore
reports </H4>
&quot;If you look at German newspapers,&quot; says Tim von Halle, managing
director of fixed-income sales and trading at West Merchant Bank (the investment
banking arm of Westdeutsche Landesbank), &quot;it is clear that at least
60% of Germans don't believe European economic and monetary union (EMU)
will happen by 1999.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Analysts and investors increasingly appear to agree, galvanized by German
finance minister Theo Waigel's recent admission that even Germany is behind
schedule in meeting the Maastricht <BR>
currency-convergence criteria. The admission prompted one German banker
to remark - only half in jest - that aside from Luxembourg, the economies
best equipped to meet the criteria by 1999 are Argentina and New Zealand.
<BR>
<BR>
Several banks are beginning to discount a delay in currency convergence.
For example, Banque Paribas Capital Markets reported in January &quot;we
believe that some degree of flexibility is desirable in applying the Maastricht
criteria but it currently looks as though a good deal more than mere flexibility
is needed to get EMU off the ground by the target date of 1999. Our view
is therefore that EMU is most likely to be delayed because 1999 is simply
unrealistic as a starting date, unless the financial underpinnings of EMU
are to be discarded or a political deal between France and Germany overrides
the Maastricht criteria.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Neither of these eventualities seems probable: flexibility is unlikely to
appeal to a Bundesbank already sceptical of the long-term soundness of the
proposed new currency, the Euro, while a behind-closed-doors &quot;deal&quot;
between France and Germany on, perhaps, a mini-Euro, is unlikely to endear
either country to those EU governments which have battled to implement austere
and domestically unpopular convergence plans. <BR>
<BR>
Whether players in the German bond market were already factoring in the
possibility of EMU delay last year is open to debate. Through the year,
the steepening of Germany's yield curve, in which the spread between two-year
and 10-year Bunds climbed from 112 basis points (bp) to around 270bp by
the end of December, was attributed to worries about the long-term security
of the Euro. &quot;What we saw last year,&quot; says Mary Bloem, European
bond analyst at Banque Paribas in London, &quot;was a substantial flow of
German assets into short-dated German paper and into Switzerland because
of [investor] concerns that if they were long-term holders of German Bunds
they would be paid in Euros.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Bloem points to several other factors militating last year against concentration
at the longer end of the curve - above all, the short-term prospects for
further Bundesbank easing of interest rates and the scope for continued
Deutschmark strength. <BR>
<BR>
At Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt, vice-president Manfred Ludwig believes, however,
that investors are already dismissing the possibility of convergence by
1999. &quot;The story last year was a risk <BR>
premium at the long end of the curve and demand concentrated in maturities
up to five years,&quot; he says. &quot;Now that seems to be receding. A
lot of investors were of short duration and now we're seeing many of them
move along the yield curve.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The proof, according to many Frankfurt syndicate managers, was in the demand
- local and international - for Deutschmark issues stretching along the
curve. Although this has been dampened somewhat by the recent fall-off.
While sovereigns such as Sweden and Finland issued at five and seven years
respectively, Austria opted for a 10-year maturity - an important breakthrough,
given that it was the first good-sized 10-year Deutschmark issue since July.
<BR>
<BR>
Demand for the issue (especially from east Asian accounts), encouraged the
deal's lead manager, Dresdner Bank, to increase it to Dm2 billion from Dm1.5
billion. Austria, which reportedly was keen to test an even longer maturity
of 12 years, was then followed into the 10-year sector by a cluster of other
borrowers, including domestics such as L-Bank (a Dm1 billion global issue)
and Landesbank Hessen-Th&uuml;ringen (Helaba). However, the recent market
downturn has restrained issuance since late February. <BR>
<BR>
Underlying demand for longer-dated paper is not just a reflection of diminishing
concerns about the Euro, or of over-supply of five-year paper. At DG Bank
in Frankfurt, fixed-income director Willi Ufer suggests that many domestic
investors, shell-shocked after 1994's upheavals, missed out on much of last
year's rally and are now becoming increasingly edgy about their performance
records. &quot;The long end of the curve is falling as domestic investors
become worried about their performance requirements,&quot; he says. &quot;They
are beginning to realize that every day they stay in the money markets they're
losing money.&quot; Much the same argument could be made for emerging-market
Deutschmark issues, which have flooded the market in early 1996. Frankfurt-based
bankers point out that strong demand for Latin American issues, in particular,
has been driven by yield-hungry German and Swiss retail accounts rather
than by domestic insurance companies. <BR>
<BR>
Booming investor demand for an expanding range of maturities and credit
risks is one reason why bond market professionals in Frankfurt are in euphoric
mood. They appear almost uniform in their belief that all fundamental indicators
point towards an extension of the bull market in German bonds (once the
market rebounds), through at least the first half of 1996. With German unemployment
pushing past the four-million mark, and with Deutsche Bank, for one, putting
the chances of a German recession in 1996 at 30%, analysts appear to agree
that concerns about inflation (for once) are taking a back seat to fears
about joblessness. This leaves the way open for further interest-rate easing
[as yet initiated] by the Bundesbank. <BR>
<BR>
As recent research published by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell notes: &quot;Economic
growth has recently come to a standstill, so that the Bundesbank's latest
rate cut (in mid-December) now looks more than justified. With the discount
rate at 3%, there is for the moment plenty of room to let money-market rates
fall further. Should the economy worsen sharply, however, we would expect
the discount rate to be cut to the historical low of 2.5%.&quot; For those
contemplating the short-term outlook for German bonds, the Deutsche report
adds: &quot;We do not expect a definitive turnaround in monetary policy
- an increase in interest rates - until the first quarter of 1997 at the
earliest.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Indicators aside, there are plenty of other reasons for the positive outlook.
Above all, market players point to a surge in the globalization of the Deutschmark
sector in 1995. &quot;The trend towards internationalization is sweeping,&quot;
says von Halle at West Merchant Bank. &quot;One of the driving forces behind
the market's growth last year was a fundamental reallocation of assets by
Asian investors, especially central banks, and their acceptance of the Deutschmark
as a reserve currency.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Roman Schmidt, first vice-president of debt capital markets syndication
at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, agrees. &quot;One thing that has become clear
over the last 12 to 18 months is that most of the world's major institutional
investors are seeing the global capital markets being split up into dollars,
yen and Deutschmarks,&quot; he says. &quot;Whereas two or three years ago
they tended to buy the <BR>
convergence story, which meant guilder or French franc bonds, they are now
concentrating on the Deutschmark because it will form the major base for
any Euro-currency we see in the future.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Frankfurt-based syndicate managers say it is not just the currency which
is making the Deutschmark the medium of choice for a growing range of issuers
and investors. The product line, too, is increasingly being tailored towards
international institutional investors. Two examples of this last year were
the World Bank's Dm3 billion seven-year issue and a Dm1.5 billion issue
by the European Investment Bank (EIB). The EIB broke with tradition by opting
for a negotiated price mechanism rather than a competitive bidding structure,
which was interpreted as testimony to the expanding maturity of the Deutschmark
market. <BR>
<BR>
The breakthrough towards genuine internationalization of the Deutschmark
market came in 1995 and early 1996 in the form of the new jumbo Pfandbrief
issues. These are defined as bonds of Dm500 million or more which are issued
through a syndicate whose members undertake to maintain a secondary market
on a bid/offer spread of five or 10 pfennigs. Finally, a traditionally illiquid
domestic instrument gained some semblance of international flavour, with
foreign banks - led initially by UBS - stepping in for the first time as
lead managers of Pfandbrief issues. <BR>
<BR>
Further internationalization of the Pfandbrief market came in January this
year through the launch of Bayerische Vereinsbank's 10-year $1.5 billion
issue. The deal was groundbreaking for a <BR>
number of reasons. First, it was led by a quartet of German and international
banks, with Bayerische itself joining forces with Commerzbank, Merrill Lynch
and UBS to place the issue. Second, as Merrill's Ludwig notes, &quot;it
was really the first of the jumbo issues to have been explicitly targeted
at foreign investors and to have been structured around Asian demand. We
announced the launch to coincide with the market's opening in Asia and priced
it on a spread basis as we would with Euros.&quot; As a result, thinks Ludwig,
about 40% of the issue was placed outside Germany. <BR>
<BR>
The Vereinsbank issue was followed quickly by the first-ever &quot;global&quot;
Pfandbrief, a Dm2 billion issue for Depfa led by Commerzbank, Morgan Stanley
and UBS. Again, this issue took the structure of the market a few steps
further. First, it was preceded by the issuer securing a triple-A rating
from Moody's, without which the issue would have found few takers in the
US. Second, the fees were set at Euromarket levels, rather than being based
on the traditional five- or 10-pfenning bid/offer spread. <BR>
<BR>
To Peter Schwicht, managing director at JP Morgan in Frankfurt, these recent
developments herald an ultimate convergence between the Pfandbrief and the
Eurodeutschmark sectors. Indeed, the placement of the Depfa global issue
- 35% in the US, 30% in Europe and 25% in Asia - coupled with its spread-based
pricing, Euromarket fees and international bookrunning consortium suggests
that the distinction between the two products is already so fine as to be
irrelevant. <BR>
<BR>
There are a number of other pointers towards the growing internationalization
of the Deutschmark capital market. It is not just the Pfandbrief issuers,
for example, who are turning to the international market in search of fresh
funding. Leonhard Fischer, head of treasury and trading at Dresdner Bank
in Frankfurt, notes that &quot;we are tapping international markets like
never before. We launched the first $1 billion yankee issue and our first
medium term note (MTN) issue. It is concrete internationalization and it
is happening throughout the German borrowing sector. But to capitalize on
the goal of internationalization, it is essential to develop the Finanzplatz
Frankfurt; not just in the interest of the banks but for others as well.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Above all, internationalization of the Deutschmark capital market is evident
in the expanding influence, involvement and acceptance of foreign banks
as German borrowers increasingly seek to gain access to international funding,
be it via listings on the New York Stock Exchange, yankee issues or syndicated
loans. Witness last year's unprecedented decision by Siemens to appoint
JP Morgan as the sole arranger of its $2 billion facility. <BR>
<BR>
Yet international banks do not need to have been in Frankfurt long term
to win an increasing chunk of Deutschmark-denominated business. European
banks such as BZW and ABN Amro have been winning substantial mandates unimaginable
five years ago. As Yann Gindre, head of origination at BZW in London, says:
&quot;To be an originator in a non-German bank used to be a very tough job,
both because borrowers weren't issuing that much and because the market
was so well-controlled by the German banks. Now, non-Germans can win business.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Frankfurt's market players believe that one central theme in 1996 will be
the increasing international exposure of the Pfandbrief. Many also expect
that there will be further diversification in the Deutschmark fixed-income
product range. Asset-backed finance is one potential growth area. After
a lull following last year's Rheinhyp Dm380 million GEMs (German mortgage
securities) issue the sector has begun to come to life. In January this
year, Deutsche Bank announced the launch of Germany's first public asset-backed
financing in a Dm500 million issue for Volkswagen. Additionally, one US
banker in Frankfurt reports that his institution is putting the finishing
touches to a similar securitization on behalf of a German corporate client.
<BR>
<BR>
Another area which is ripe for development, say Frankfurt bankers, is the
broader range of <BR>
structured deals. &quot;Because of the low interest-rate outlook we're seeing
very strong demand now for yield enhancement,&quot; says DG Bank's Ufer.
&quot;In the first wave of structured deals we saw a lot of naive products.
The second wave is going to be much more sophisticated and driven in part
by a big merger phase on the asset-management side.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Despite the progress of the past year, concerns remain about the long-term
competitiveness of the Deutschmark product range and, by association, about
Frankfurt's future as a financial centre. &quot;Clearly there are still
deficiencies at the long and short ends of the curve,&quot; says Voigt,
&quot;and if you focus on the future and on the eventual introduction of
the single currency, then these are deficiencies which will not favour the
development of Frankfurt as a financial centre.&quot; Tentative attempts
have been made to extend the yield curve, both by the central authorities
and by private borrowers, but the government's 1994 introduction of a 30-year
bond suffered, say bankers, from woeful timing. Meanwhile, Germany's commercial
paper (CP) market is brutally condemned by one US banker in Frankfurt as
a &quot;joke&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Investors, particularly money-market funds, are crying out for three-
to six-month paper,&quot; says another Frankfurt banker, &quot;but the Bundesbank
still prevents 98% of non-German borrowers from issuing Deutschmarks with
a maturity of less than two years.&quot; Nor, since the axing of the Bulis
market (Bundesbank issuance) for three-, six- and nine-month government
paper in September 1994, have there been any government benchmark issues
at the short end of the curve. &quot;The whole market was fuelled by the
Treuhand [the German privatization agency],&quot; says the same banker,
&quot;and when that ceased to exist the government refused to step in by
offering short-term government or quasi-government paper. Another key problem
with the CP market was the disaster at Metallgesellschaft, which was a very
active CP issuer. So we had two major setbacks from which the market never
really recovered.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Another familiar gripe about Frankfurt and its future competitiveness is
the Bundesbank's dogged maintenance of minimum reserve requirements, which
have stunted the development of a repo market and encouraged the main German
banks to establish repo desks in London. Some Frankfurt bankers draw a measure
of consolation from the Bundesbank's cuts in reserve requirements in 1993,
1994 and 1995, although as Salomon Brothers pointed out shortly after the
latest cut, it would be premature to see these as a precursor to the abandonment
reserve requirements. <BR>
<BR>
The extent to which the deficiencies in the structure of the German capital
market will jeopardize Frankfurt's potential as a financial centre in the
new Europe is unclear. Equally unclear, say Frankfurt-based bankers, is
where genuine responsibility for Frankfurt's long-term development lies.
It is easy to blame the Bundesbank for an ultra-conservative stance induced
by paranoia over inflation for failing to support the evolution of the capital
market. But Dresdner's treasury and trading chief Fischer, who was formerly
in charge of capital markets at JP Morgan in Frankfurt, cautions against
misjudging the fundamental mandate of the Bundesbank: &quot;We need to make
it absolutely clear that it is not the job of the ministry of finance, the
Bundesbank or even the banks to think about the Finanzplatz as the main
priority. The Bundesbank's priority is to secure the stability of the Deutschmark.
The finance ministry's priority is to ensure that it can borrow as competitively
as possible and the banks' priority is to ensure that they make a return
on equity for their shareholders.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Against this background, things are changing, says Fischer. A few years
ago, he suggests, observers outside Germany could justifiably have accused
the local mortgage-bank fraternity of complacency, given the ease with which
the banks could sell their bonds in the domestic market. The enthusiasm
with which they are now promoting their issues overseas represents a sea-change
in the mortgage banks' mentality, and Fischer believes it is little more
than a matter of time before Germany's biggest issuer - the government -
follows suit. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Germany has to ensure that in 10 years' time it will still be able
to issue debt as easily as it has in the past regardless of what happens
with EMU,&quot; he says. &quot;We're already seeing important changes and
that's why I believe Germany is going to be a fascinating capital market
over the next decade. And if that helps the Finanzplatz, fine.&quot; <BR>

<H2><A NAME="historical"></A>A historical shift or just a hangover? </H2>
<H4>The rise and fall of the Eurodeutschmark bond sector threatens to upset
the <BR>
system. Too much of this year's new-issue volume could be leftover. It may
mean a bad headache - or just temporary indigestion, as Rupert Gordon-Walker
reports </H4>
Is the Deutschmark bond market heading for a hangover? Between Janaury and
mid-February the market was asked to absorb one-third of the total registered
in the whole of 1995. Eurodeutschmark offerings in January reached Dm26
billion (compared to a monthly average in 1995 of Dm7.14 billion) - almost
34% of total new Eurobond deals, compared with 27% for Eurodollar issues.
But for years dollar-denominated bonds have taken a market share of between
30% and 40%. Unless this is a historical shift, the Deutschmark sector is
on the verge of over-indulging, as the late February fall-off demonstrates.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is not sustainable,&quot; says Roman Schmidt, director of syndications
at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Frankfurt. &quot;Investors are full and many
are offside, several deals are probably unsold and even retail investors
have realized that some of the new issues were not cheap.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Issuers have been taking advantage of two yield-curve features. First, strong
performance in the underlying government market (the recent fall-off aside)
has encouraged domestic borrowers to lock into 10-year funding at under
6%. When the Bund futures contract reached the 100.5-101 range, syndicate
chiefs contacted bank and corporate treasurers - another offering then hit
the screens. In January more than Dm5.5 billion was raised below this resistance
level. <BR>
<BR>
The second factor is a technical anomaly at the five-year part of the curve
which means that the interest-rate-swap window has been open since the beginning
of 1995. There are two theories for the cause of this opportunity, although
they seem to be two aspects of the same phenomenon, viewed from different
perspectives. According to Amr Mounib, senior vice-president and head of
Eurobond trading at ABN-Amro in Amsterdam, strong demand for five-year Bobls
has made them expensive compared to the futures contract. All the deliverable
bonds, numbers 106, 110 and the benchmark 116, are &quot;special&quot; in
the repo market. Uncertainty as to whether economic and monetary union will
be achieved in Europe on target, has in turn led to &quot;safe-haven&quot;
status for the Deutschmark, and has prompted massive central bank buying
of five-year Bobls. This has depressed yields at a key point on an otherwise
steep yield curve. <BR>
<BR>
But as Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's Schmidt points out, there is no real five-year
Bobl. The benchmark 116, against which new Eurobonds are priced, matures
in August 2000, so &quot;five-year deals are being measured against a four-and-a-half-year
Bobl&quot;. An outstanding 8.5% Bund with a redemption date in February
2001 might be a better reference bond, but market convention dictates that
the benchmark is the latest Bobl. This is convenient for issuers because
the high-coupon Bund yields about 35 basis points [bp] (0.35%) more than
number 116. Nor is the distortion about to end. The latest offering from
the ministry of finance, number 117, will have an October 2000 redemption
date. <BR>
<BR>
Smart investors now seem aware of the anomaly and will be more selective,
says a syndicate head at a US bank. However, to suggest that investors have
recognized the illusion for what it is, seems disingenuous. Institutions
do know that yield spreads quoted on offerings by enthusiastic salesmen
are not quite what they seem. The swap window has opened for issuers but
lenders have been content to buy Deutschmarks, usually unhedged. German
retail buyers want yield and have gotten it - valuing spread differentials
is always an art rather than a science. A rising market meant that it was
impossible for long-term holders to lose, and a constant supply of different
credits has given investors switching alternatives. Others are likely to
follow the flow, once the fall-off has eased. A fund manager at a leading
uk institution says: &quot;We were happy to buy becasue we knew there was
strong retail demand throughout continental Europe.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Low interest rates have also been inducing even more European retail bond
buying than usual. And the background of a weaker yen and low domestic yields
has also sent Japanese investors overseas into 10-year Eurodeutschmarks
and emerging Latin sovereigns (offering exotic rates) which have been able
to raise funds 60bp-70bp cheaper than in US dollars. Asian central banks
have filled their vaults with five-year paper, hoping for short-term trading
profits. Value measured by yield differentials against the government curve
has been less important than the returns gained from falling interest rates
and Deutschmark appreciation. <BR>
<BR>
But in February the market staggered. &quot;The Dm2.5 billion 10-year deal
for KFW [Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau] at the end of January was too big
and led to a falling market and widening spreads,&quot; says Mounib. This
continued into late February, with the market contracting sharply. <BR>
<BR>
According to Schmidt at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell around half of this year's
new issues are still on lead-managers' books, although the percentage varies
according to sector. About 30%-40% of recent triple-A sovereign paper probably
is in firm hands, high-yielding Latin American issues for first-tier names
such as Mexico and Argentina have also been placed, but bank and corporate
financing vehicles are struggling to find homes for more than 40%-50% of
their issues. <BR>
<BR>
The top three German banks, Deutsche, Commerzbank and Dresdner continued
to dominate primary issuance, leading between them one-third of deals last
year. Morgan Stanley and CS First Boston led the overseas challenge, and
ABN-Amro Hoare Govett, with 15 deals worth almost Dm4 billion, made an impact.
<BR>
<BR>
But Eurobond issuers also face competition from the growing Pfandbriefe
borrowing programme, which has raised more than $18 billion to date. The
public-sector secured bonds (Offentliche) are rated triple-A by Moody's
and the mortgage bonds (Hypotheken) issued by Depfa, the public-sector lending
institution, are rated one notch lower. Increasingly, issues are being targeted
at international investors. <BR>
<BR>
Yet a saturated market incites innovation. On February 1 1996, Volkswagen
raised Dm500m million secured by car lease receivables in only the second
asset-backed deal in Germany. Assets are placed in a special purpose vehicle
(SPV) which takes loans off the company's balance sheet and frees capital.
The SPV gives sufficient cover for the bond's interest payments to ensure
a triple-A rating from credit agencies. <BR>
<BR>
The enhanced international profile of the Eurodeutschmark sector is also
encouraging the introduction of products that are already well-established
in the dollar markets. So further asset-backed deals are likely this year,
as well as more issues that are callable in the event of withholding tax
imposition. Further high-volatility zero coupon bonds, which also simplify
forex transactions for overseas investors, are expected. <BR>
<BR>
However, two first-quarter deals illustrate the developing trend in issuance
from emerging and niche market issuers. Argentina, after tapping the market
in smaller size last autumn, launched a Dm500 million seven-year issue at
473bp over the curve through CSFB, which immediately raised it to Dm1 billion
in response to overwhelming demand from retail and emerging-market funds.
This deal was quickly followed by Mexico, which also issued seven-year paper,
at 484bp, and again its reception prompted lead-manager Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell to increase the issue by 50% to Dm1.5 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Isabelle Terrillon, associate director of emerging markets at Nomura International
in London, sees more emerging sovereigns looking to the Deutschmark sector
this year. &quot;The Deutschmark will be like the yen was last year for
attracting exotic borrowers, particularly from the transitional central
European economies.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
One candidate, the National Bank of Hungary, will have to wait unless it
is prepared to pay more than its usual 250bp. Turkey is asking for bids
on a five-year deal after the success of its three-year issue in January
and is likely to issue at around 300bp. Other high-yielding issuers are
likely to be the Province of Buenos Aires, Brazilian development bank BNDES
and Sao Paulo's electricity utility CESP, which is waiting for central bank
approval before going ahead with a Dm500 million five-year issue. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, as long as the swap window stays open, top-quality sovereign
names will also continue to tap the market. Arbitrage opportunities for
borrowers in the dollar sector are scarce and European retail preference
for European sovereigns should resume once the backlog of issues has gone.
Slow economic growth in Germany, which will justify low domestic interest
rates, is a prerequisite for sustaining demand. Italy, Sweden and Portugal
will be regular issuers - six deals for the Kingdom of Sweden last year
worth Dm4.5 billion were specifically targeted at retail buyers. <BR>
<BR>
With a wide selection of AAA names and bank and corporate financing vehicles
- mixed with high-yielding sovereigns - to come, investors should wait for
the indigestion to subside. The open swap window might look quite refreshing
once again. <BR>

<H2><A NAME="floodgates"></A>Are the floodgates open? </H2>
<H4>All German banks want to increase their shareholder value and have come
up with one or two surprising innovations to prove it. But can they resist
the ever-growing demands of international investors? Laura Covill investigates
</H4>
Daimler-Benz's surprise decision to ditch Fokker, the loss-making aircraft
manufacturer, made history as the first time that a major German corporation
has thrown one of its core businesses overboard without warning. The ruthlessness
of the move, which gave Daimler a Dm2.3 billion ($1.6 billion) write-off
but may destroy 6,000 jobs and push Fokker into bankruptcy, surprised many
who still believed in the paternalism of German big business - at least
towards their own subsidiaries. <BR>
<BR>
But it has not escaped the notice of other German corporations that the
markets rewarded the mettle of Daimler chief executive J&uuml;ergen Schrempp
with a boost in the share price. Rightly so, says Richard Davidson, an investment
strategist at Morgan Stanley in London. &quot;[Daimler] is now focusing
on achieving a decent return rather than becoming the biggest company in
the world, which is what it seemed to be aiming for before. That's what
Daimler's business should be about.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Belatedly, German banks are also recognizing that they must act in the interests
of shareholders to attract and keep international investors who act professionally
and make decisions for the long term. In short they must offer shareholder
value. <BR>
<BR>
Things were different just a handful of years ago. &quot;Our capital increases
went brilliantly well,&quot; says a rueful Albrecht Schmidt, chairman of
the board of managing directors at Bayerische Vereinsbank. &quot;Then, as
now, we had a good reputation in the market. And no one ever asked us about
shareholder value.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Now, all the major private-sector German banks - Deutsche Bank, Dresdner
Bank, Commerzbank, Vereinsbank and Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank
(Hypo-Bank), plus the new conglomerate Bankgesellschaft Berlin - acknowledge
that they have to vie not only with each other and other companies in the
Dax 30-share index, but also with foreign banks for the attention of international
investors. At the same time, as Schmidt points out, domestic German investors
are developing an interest in international equities and securities. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The debate on the single currency has made the German banks aware
that they have to compete for investors' favour with institutions from other
European countries,&quot; says J&uuml;ergen Ackermann, head of investor
relations at Commerzbank. &quot;Investor portfolios are becoming geared
towards sectors, rather than countries.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This creates a double danger for German equities. Not only can German stocks
be substituted for same-sector stocks from other European markets but they
also remain stubbornly expensive because of the high Deutschmark and their
substantial capital and cost bases. &quot;If you invested on a pure valuation
basis you'd probably never buy Germany at the moment,&quot; comments Susie
Roberts, a German fund manager at Robert Fleming in London. <BR>
<BR>
This dilemma has turned shareholder value in Germany from a jaded clich&eacute;
used to describe unwelcome foreign practices into a fresh and new approach
to the international capital market. <BR>
<BR>
Since German investor relations began in earnest at the start of the decade
- Deutsche became the first German bank to set up such a department in 1990
- close encounters with foreign fund managers, strategists and treasurers
have been a genuine revelation. German corporate financiers and bankers
have had to overcome a natural reluctance to deal with investors who care
little for the consensus element in the German social market economy, who
demand dividends today, not lower provisions tomorrow, and who prefer transparent
accounts to an opaque, but steady profit trend over decades. <BR>
<BR>
For Deutsche Bank, which is attempting to change its entire management culture,
the shareholder-value movement has come as an opportunity. &quot;One way
to get more discipline into a company is to create more public criticism,&quot;
says J&uuml;ergen Krumnow, the board member in charge of accounting and
controlling. In a bold move announced late last year Krumnow anticipated
the disclosure demands of most investors by pledging to publish the bank's
1995 balance sheet under international accounting standards (IAS). <BR>
<BR>
If this happens, without exemptions and loopholes, Krumnow will disclose
far more than a German bank has ever revealed about its true financial position.
For where German accounting standards allow companies to paint a general
picture of earnings and offer unrivalled scope for adjustments in the guise
of hidden reserves, provisioning and extraordinary profit and loss, international
accounting standards are relatively rigid. Krumnow promises that Deutsche
Bank's IAS accounts will contain full details of provisions, goodwill, pension
obligations, market and book values of participations and - most spectacularly
- hidden reserves. <BR>
<BR>
Once Deutsche Bank's reserves are known, Krumnow will have little scope
to indulge in &quot;profit-smoothing&quot;, the traditional German practice
of borrowing from hidden reserves to boost earnings in a poor year, and
vice-versa in a good year, so that that an even profit trend is discernible
over a number of years. <BR>
<BR>
In turn, the choppier earnings pattern will have to be reflected in the
dividend, so that another traditional practice, that of &quot;dividend-smoothing&quot;
(shareholders are paid a lower percentage of eanings in good years to bolster
reserves for the lean years), is out too. The German tradition is to offer
a steady upward trend in dividends over a number of years, but now, says
Krumnow, Deutsche's dividend will fluctuate in line with the earnings figures.
<BR>
<BR>
Significantly though, Krumnow himself appears not wholly converted to the
idea of shareholder value as it is understood internationally. One moment,
Deutsche Bank's finance director opines that &quot;shareholder value is
about optimizing earnings in each division [of the bank].&quot; The next
moment, he backs the traditional German theory that divisions should cover
each other's losses if one division has had a difficult year or large investment
needs. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I know shareholders don't want to hear this but we have a kind of
social responsibility,&quot; Krumnow says, referring to the bank's equity
stake in a medium-sized German company. &quot;In Germany ownership carries
a social obligation and you can't neglect the interests of the proprietors
and the workforce.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
No wonder, then, that finance directors at other German banks and blue chips
were shocked and dismayed by Krumnow's plan. For Deutsche Bank is not only
improving disclosure, it is dismantling an entire equity culture. Inevitably,
other listed banks will eventually be obliged to follow. <BR>
<BR>
But investors welcome the opportunity to learn more about Deutsche Bank's
business structure and earnings. Ian McEwan, a Merrill Lynch banking analyst
who recently produced a study of Deutsche Bank, says that the IAS accounts
&quot;will increase transparency by giving a full picture of provision movements
and securities gains, and in particular, should give a much better picture
of the state of balance-sheet provisions.&quot; This does not alter McEwan's
fundamental belief that the bank's return on equity and earnings per share
are declining; indeed, greater disclosure will allow analysts to examine
the accounts in more detail and to make more precise criticisms than previously
possible. <BR>
<BR>
Once it is easier to compare German banks' stock with British or Spanish
institutions, finance directors will not be able to escape pressure to produce
a more impressive balance sheet. <BR>
<BR>
Unwittingly, Deutsche Bank may have opened the floodgates to a much more
critical investor culture. Krumnow has raised international investor expectations
not just of Deutsche Bank, but of other German banks' stock as well. <BR>
<BR>
In particular, it is return on equity which has finance directors cringing.
Hypo-Bank wants to increase its post-tax return on equity to 15% within
five to 10 years, while Vereinsbank is aiming for 18% &quot;within 10 years,
maybe less&quot;, according to Schmidt. At Commerzbank, the goal is 10%
within three years. That compares with 20% to 25% usually achieved by other
European institutions. <BR>
<BR>
This will not be achieved easily at German banks. Krumnow points out that
Deutsche Bank's return on equity will actually fall as a result of IAS accounting
because about Dm4 billion of provisions no longer will be recorded as profit.
McEwan points out that the key to capital growth is the amount of retained
profit after the dividend has been paid. In other words, the more generous
the dividend as a percentage of net profits, the more difficult it will
be to create new capital. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the only real means of improving capital ratios is to desist from
further capital increases. German banks have gained an unwelcome reputation
for their eagerness to ask investors for fresh money but they are now promising
to exercise more self-discipline. <BR>
<BR>
Hypo-Bank planned to increase its capital this year but has now dropped
the idea. &quot;Investors tend to take a negative view of capital increases,&quot;
says Werner M&uuml;enstermann, the board member in charge of accounting
and treasury management. &quot;They wrinkle their brows at every attempt
[to raise money] and you feel they're asking why we aren't capable of expanding
on the strength of our own resources.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Under IAS, Deutsche Bank will report the book value of its industrial holdings,
so that the difference between book and market values will be transparent.
That will simply heighten demands for Deutsche Bank and other banks to sell
those holdings and release hidden assets on the balance sheet. Although
Commerzbank recently sold a number of its holdings, and Deutsche Bank last
year sold 3% of its considerable stake in Daimler-Benz, the tax consequences
of doing so were so punitive that large-scale selling probably remains out
of the question, no matter how much shareholders plead with the banks to
realize their wealth. <BR>
<BR>
Likewise, dividend payments from German companies are likely to remain at
modest levels as long as they are taxed at source: it's much more cost-effective
for banks to add net earnings to reserves or loan/loss provisions instead.
<BR>
<BR>
In the first nine months of 1995, all six main bank stocks (except Commerzbank)
showed a decrease in interest and commission income. Prognoses for 1996
are no better. Indeed, some Deutsche Bank competitors suggest that it is
introducing IAS accounts now so as to divert attention from its poor operational
performance. <BR>
<BR>
McEwan recently reduced his 1996 earnings forecasts for several German banks
on the basis that growth in loans will be poor with falling margins, own-account
trading will expand only marginally, cost growth should remain above inflation
and increased provisions may be needed as the property market turns down
and the high Deutschmark takes its toll on smaller German companies. <BR>
<BR>
Each bank has its own particular recipe for improved earnings and strategic
success in the long term, and this always centres on its position as &quot;house
bank&quot; for a broad raft of corporate clients and its penetration of
the retail market, plus other factors. At Hypo-Bank, that factor is its
&quot;focused strategy in investment management&quot;, while Deutsche Bank's
ambitions to become a global investment bank are well known. <BR>
<BR>
But none of the main banks is contemplating a radical departure from its
traditional cost and earnings base. To take one example: Vereinsbank is
planning to set up a direct bank and market rumours say the bank is considering
closing dozens of branches in its Bavarian network. But according to board
chairman Albrecht Schmidt, Vereinsbank will reduce the range of services
available at each branch, although there will be no drastic closure policy.
<BR>
<BR>
Improving profitability will be more a matter of style. &quot;We want to
make our products so attractive that the prices we set will be accepted,
and we also want to optimize the time and expense involved,&quot; Schmidt
said. Simply put, there will be a gradual improvement in products and services,
accompanied by cost-cutting from inside existing structures. This seems
to indicate the limits of German banks' dedication to shareholder value.
<BR>
<BR>
Fundamentally, the notion is still deeply troublesome to German companies,
which believe that they owe an equal duty to creditors and to customers.
German business law and accounting standards are based on the principle
that creditor protection takes priority over the interests of shareholder
or management. &quot;The banks are faced with an internal conflict between
providing transparency for investors and giving assurances to their customers,&quot;
explains Ackermann of Commerzbank. <BR>
<BR>
That social market contract is at the heart of German banking; which is,
at best, long-term and patient with businesses in temporary difficulties
and at worst over-indulgent and uncritical with trusted customers who conceal
desperate problems (Deutsche Bank's blindness to the frauds and concealment
perpetrated at the Schneider property group being one notorious example).
<BR>
<BR>
And under a strict interpretation of shareholder value, Metallgesellschaft
would never have been saved from its debacle in the oil market because the
(December 1993) rescue package awarded fresh money to an unrestructured
company which had already lost billions and could offer no immediate prospect
of repayment. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers brought up in the German system have deep-seated belief in the virtues
of the country's traditional financial system. For example, Schmidt of Vereinsbank
says that &quot;untaxed reserves&quot; (his way of describing equity participations)
are necessary instruments to cope with cyclical fluctuations without endangering
the balance sheet. <BR>
<BR>
Despite their intentions to improve shareholder value (and it is more than
lip service) German companies stilll do not operate in the kind of environment
where &quot;the company's intrinsic value is reflected in share price and
in dividend&quot;, as Schmidt says. Moreover, they have little inclination
to change to a system which they associate with shareholder tyranny, short-termism,
and loss of authority by the bank's management. German bankers will resist
those trends as long as possible, no matter what the consequences for shareholder
value. <BR>

<H2><A NAME="issuers"></A>German issuers look east </H2>
<H4>Deutschmark-denominated assets are much in demand and nowhere more so
than in Japan. Lesser-known German borrowers are seizing the opportunity
- suddenly going international and east, as Philip Moore reports </H4>
For a growing number of German borrowers, including mortgage banks, savings
banks and municipalities the booming Eurodeutschmark sector provides an
excellent opportunity to go international. Diversification of their investor
bases - to satisfy growing demand for local lending - is the main reason.
But besides focusing on strong demand from European investors for Deutschmark-denominated
assets, these borrowers are expected to capitalize on an upsurge in interest
from east Asia, especially Japan. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;A lot of German issuers have gone to great lengths to launch investor-relations
programmes in the Far East,&quot; says Tim von Halle, managing director
of fixed-income sales and trading at West Merchant. Merrill Lynch syndicate
manager Manfred Ludwig thinks that there are probably about 20 German bank
issuers, including the Landesbanks, which could easily raise competitive
funding in east Asia - a far cry from five years ago when the number probably
could have been counted on one hand. <BR>
<BR>
These German issuers are offering the Japanese irresistable pick-ups of
up to 400-500 basis points (bp) over locally available assets. They also
offer ratings-conscious investors a level of quality which is increasingly
difficult to match. Yann Gindre, managing director of debt capital markets
and head of origination at BZW in London, points out that &quot;when you
talk to Japanese investors and ask what they want, they will tell you AA
or AAA borrowers. Now how many of those are left in the European financial
sector? All the French have gone. The Swiss don't need the money. That leaves
the German banks, whose ratings have held up very well.&quot; Hence the
transformation of a borrower such as Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, which has
moved from being essentially reliant on its domestic markets to become a
familiar name with Japanese retail investors. <BR>
<BR>
After the government, probably the best-known German borrower internationally
is Frankfurt-based development bank Kreditanstalt f&uuml;r Wiederaufbau
(KFW), a prolific issuer which raised Dm22 billion in 1995. According to
treasurer and senior vice-president Gerhard Lewark, since January 26 1996,
the bank has been recognized officially as enjoying a risk profile on a
par with the government. This was the result of a reduction by Germany's
Federal Banking Supervisory Office of KFW's Bank for International Settlements'
risk weighting to zero from 20%. Lewark expects that for the time being
this reduction will have a beneficial impact more on the bank's domestic
fundraising than on its international borrowing, but he remains optimistic
that the ever-expanding internationalization of the Deutschmark bond market
will play into KFW's hands. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm a great supporter of the internationalization of the Pfandbrief
market,&quot; says Lewark. &quot;I don't see Pfandbriefe issues as competition
to KFW, but if a growing number of issuers can contribute to making international
investors more aware of the Deutschmark spread products, it can only benefit
us all.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Despite KFW's strong reputation overseas, Lewark insists that the bank -
which will raise some Dm20 billion this year (probably in line with last
year's distribution of 51% in the domestic market and 49% internationally)
- can ill afford to become complacent. &quot;Of course we are well known
within the international underwriting community,&quot; he says, &quot;but
our view is that a portfolio manager in Edinburgh or a French insurance
company ought to be holding KFW paper. We have no substantial assets in
sterling or French francs but we are aiming to issue in those currencies
in order to become better known in Europe. It's our way of preparing for
EMU.&quot; Most of the bank's non-Deutschmark funding, he says, is swapped
into dollars, although its last French franc issue was swapped into Deutschmark.
<BR>
<BR>
The reduced risk weighting for KFW raised a number of eyebrows among those
German issuing competitors which remain on a 20% rating. Many bankers insist
that a handful of German special-purpose banks enjoy an identical risk profile
and credit quality to KFW. Nevertheless, this did not stop L-Bank, or its
new director of funding, Stephan Tribull, from launching a 10-year Dm1 billion
global bond in January which was well received in spite of a flurry of other
international issues from German borrowers. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think it was a true global issue in that it was the first time that
none of the managers complained about any of the paper coming back,&quot;says
Tribull. Priced at 24bp over the 2006 Bund - or two points over the previous
week's 10-year Austrian issue - the bonds were dispersed among Asian, US,
and European investors. The issue owed at least part of its success, say
Frankfurt bankers, to the issuer's insistence that the size would not be
increased, regardless of demand. Tribull believes that this year L-Bank
will issue roughly the same volume as in 1995 - about Dm17 billion - of
which 50% will be raised domestically and the remainder internationally.
<BR>
<BR>
Among institutions keen to rub shoulders with the likes of KFW, L-Bank,
DSL and Helaba (both of which launched Japanese-targeted issues in January),
is Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank. This 100%-government-owned, AAA-rated
bank has been serving Germany's agricultural, forestry and food processing
sectors since 1949 and tapping its domestic market since 1952. A spokesman
says that while the Frankfurt-based bank has made a conscious decision not
to abandon a domestic funding source which has served it well for over 40
years, it chose to start tapping international markets through the establishment
of a Euro-MTN programme in 1994. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We started with a Dm2 billion programme, which has now been lifted
to Dm5 billion. It will be lifted again, probably in March,&quot; the spokesman
for the bank explains. Issues launched by Rentenbank in 1995 included a
debut Dm500 million Euro-Deutschmark benchmark deal led in April by Banque
Paribas (Deutschland), and a Dm300 million bond arranged by Nikko Bank in
October following extensive international roadshows and a series of one-to-one
meetings with Japanese institutional investors. &quot;We will continue to
opportunistically issue off our MTN programme as long as we can secure funding
within a very tight target range of Deutschmark Libor less 15bp or 20bp,&quot;
says the spokesman. <BR>
<BR>
For now, Rentenbank's funding requirements are exclusively in Deutschmarks,
meaning that this target funding range includes the swap costs. In 1996,
according to the spokesman, Rentenbank will be aiming to raise a further
Dm10 billion, of which around 30% will be generated internationally. <BR>
<BR>
Another new name in the Eurodeutschmark market is the AAA-rated Deutsche
Ausgleichsbank (DAB), wholly-owned by the government and formed in 1950.
The bank satisifed all its funding requirements through the domestic market
before 1995, when it established a $2 billion Euro-MTN programme. It launched
its first Dm500 million issue off the programme via Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
and Lehman Brothers in October 1995, some 40% of the paper being placed
internationally. &quot;DAB was a good name to sell outside Germany,&quot;
explains one Frankfurt syndicate manager. &quot;It's a new name with international
investors but its legal structure is exactly the same as KFW's.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
According to DAB funding director Robert Fassbender, the Bonn-based bank's
requirement for 1996, swollen again by the costs of German reunification,
is expected to be between Dm5 <BR>
billion and Dm7 billion, of which some 50% will be raised overseas. Unlike
KFW, which is a natural dollar taker, all DAB's international funding is
swapped back into Deutschmarks. <BR>
<BR>
Another new class of German borrower tapping the international capital market
is the Sparkasse (savings banks). The first of these to secure a Moody's
rating, in September 1995, was Landesgirokasse Stuttgart (LG-Bank), which
was assigned a AAA/Prime-1 deposit rating and a B financial-strength rating
in reflection of its &quot;consistently high interest margins and core profitability,
low overheads and a relatively low risk profile&quot;. LG-Bank, which has
total assets of Dm35 billion, was followed into the international ratings
arena three weeks later by Stadtsparkasse K&ouml;ln (SK), Germany's third-largest
savings bank, which secured the same ratings as its Stuttgart-based counterpart.
Moody's noted that SK, which at the end of 1994 had total assets of Dm24
billion, has &quot;attained a critical mass that allows it to operate in
most product and service areas independently of its respective Landesbank&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
SK's first issue following its rating was a Dm250 million deal described
by its co-lead manager, ABN-Amro, as an &quot;internationally targeted domestic
issue&quot;. Thomas Hegel, syndicate manager at ABN-Amro's Frankfurt office,
says: &quot;Because SK had secured a long-term debt rating, it recognized
that it had the opportunity to look beyond the domestic market where investors
attach less importance to ratings. SK wanted to diversify its investor base
and we saw demand from domestic as well as Benelux-based institutions.&quot;
As a result, says Hegel, the size of the SK deal could have been raised
&quot;easily&quot; to Dm400 million from Dm250 million. <BR>
<BR>
As of late February, LG-Bank was understood to be ready to follow SK with
a larger, internationally-targeted issue launched off its recently established
Euro-MTN programme. However, bankers and analysts caution against expectations
of a flow of new issues from Germany's savings banks. As J&uuml;rgen Berblinger,
managing director of Moody's Deutschland, notes, there are in Germany more
than 600 Sparkasse, of which only 10 or 15 at most, have sufficient &quot;critical
mass&quot; to launch what he describes as &quot;borderline&quot; issues
opportunistically tapping domestic and international demand. <BR>
<BR>
Even these larger institutions, say Frankfurt banks, have very restricted
demand for international funding, given that their traditional financing
route is through domestic bond issues distributed through their savings
branches. <BR>

<H2><A NAME="dividend"></A>A dividend too many </H2>
<H4>If Daimler-Benz is in such a mess, why reward shareholders with a payout?
<BR>
Laura Covill explains </H4>
Few novice finance directors have had such a challenging first year as Manfred
Gentz of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest and - in terms of earnings - least
successful company. Eight months after taking up his position, Gentz recently
had to announce the biggest loss in German corporate history. Several divisions
of the Daimler conglomerate apparently had failed at the same time, resulting
in a shortfall of approximately Dm6 billion ($4.1 billion) in 1995. <BR>
<BR>
It came as a surprise, therefore, that shareholders accepted Gentz's news
so calmly. Bizarrely, the bombshell scarcely moved the company's share price.
Analysts simply reassessed the Daimler share as a &quot;high-risk&quot;
stock and traded in hopes of a dividend this year for the prospect of short-term
and medium-term price gains following a restructuring. <BR>
<BR>
The unspoken assertion from Gentz and J&uuml;ergen Schrempp, Daimler's new
chief executive, that others were to blame for Daimler's colossal drop in
earnings power, seems to have been accepted. They were praised for the ruthless
decision to abandon loss-making businesses. <BR>
<BR>
Much of this good work was undone, however, when Gentz made the surprise
announcement that the company might pay a dividend after all - an unusual
move for a company which is losing money in several different ways. <BR>
<BR>
Daimler's Dm6 billion loss for 1995 includes Dm2 billion operating losses
at aerospace company Dasa, Dm2.3 billion in write-offs from the abandonment
of Fokker, the loss-making aircraft manufacturer, and Dm1.5 billion in charges
from the closure of several divisions at electricals and electronics company
AEG. Under US accounting rules the group's loss is likely to be even larger,
because a greater amount of goodwill will have to be written off. <BR>
<BR>
In German eyes, however, losses are not a sufficient reason to scrap a dividend.
Indeed paying a dividend through thick and thin is the German tradition
- shareholders even received Dm8 per share in 1993, when the company made
a loss of Dm1.8 billion on the US-GAAP balance sheet. <BR>
<BR>
Although Gentz says that Daimler is &quot;fully committed&quot; to shareholder
value, he is also quick to stifle the notion that the company's financial
policy has changed dramatically. &quot;This isn't a major break with the
past. Because of the situation with the US dollar we brought forward our
review of the group portfolio and tried to identify the long-term loss-makers.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Even the hint of a dividend suggests that Daimler's board of management
is unwilling to depart from the long-standing German practice of &quot;smoothing&quot;
dividends: shareholders are paid a lower percentage of earnings in good
years so that the reserves can be bolstered and used in years when operating
results are too meagre to pay a dividend. Daimler sources say that the board
is divided on whether to continue this policy. Gentz favours it. &quot;You
can practise smoothing in dividend policy,&quot; he says. &quot;You just
have to explain your thinking clearly to shareholders.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Gentz argues that it is legitimate to pay a dividend out of current operating
earnings, even if the previous year was a financial disaster. By April,
when the dividend is announced, the board will be able to assess Daimler's
earnings in the current year and may then decide to make a payment. The
company's willingness to even contemplate a dividend indicates that Daimler's
earnings position may not be as dire as it looks. <BR>
<BR>
Schrempp and his colleagues had long suspected that Fokker and AEG would
never be profit centres, but when they finally decided to cut their losses
on those erstwhile investments, their instinct was to deal with all the
problems in one financial year. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We had to take the worst-case scenario,&quot; says Gentz. At Fokker,
for instance, Daimler has formed reserves of Dm2.3 billion, partly on the
assumption that the aircraft manufacturer will cease trading. &quot;A leasing
portfolio suffers when the manufacturer is no longer operating, since the
book value of the planes can no longer be realized,&quot; reasons Gentz.
At AEG the costs of restructuring, sale and closure will be spread over
this year and next, but the write-off of Dm1.5 billion will be made in full
in 1995. &quot;All possible depressing factors will be taken into account
on the 1995 balance sheet,&quot; says Gentz. <BR>
<BR>
The company will form substantial new provisions this year, releasing reserves
next year once the problems have been eliminated. The advantage of using
US accounting methods - and Gentz hopes that by the end of 1996 the Daimler-Benz
Group will be exempted from having to draw up German accounts at all - is
that reserves cannot be kept in limbo but must be freed immediately once
they are no longer justified. <BR>
<BR>
The strategy appears to have worked to great success. Gentz should heed
his own warning, however. &quot;The German accounting system is basically
sound. But a side-effect is that you can smooth out earnings over a number
of years and then you stop noticing exactly what is happening on the operating
side in any given year.&quot; <BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="playing"></A>Playing second fiddle </H2>
<H4>The trading culture may be changing, but Frankfurt's dream of replacing
London as Europe's financial centre remains a long way from reality. Laura
Covill on a tale of two cities </H4>
The Landeszentralbank Hesse, Frankfurt's local branch of the Bundesbank,
recently issued an appraisal of the prospects for foreign banks in Frankfurt.
It made gloomy reading. The LZB's most optimistic remark predicted that
Frankfurt's European Monetary Institute (EMI) - regarded as the forerunner
to a European central bank - will eventually attract more foreign banks
to the city. Scant comfort in that, it might seem, for the capital markets.
<BR>
<BR>
The LZB also noted that various foreign banks had decided to make Frankfurt
the focus of their Deutschmark business, but that London recently had increased
its lead over the German city in forex trading, Bund trading and Deutschmark
interest-rate derivatives trading. <BR>
<BR>
The LZB's disappointment is typical of the soul-baring that has occurred
since last year, when Deutsche Bank made London the hub of its capital-markets
operations. That announcement came as a particular shock in Frankfurt because
it unashamedly acknowledged that the city had still not become a competitive
financial centre. <BR>
<BR>
Even before this announcement, Germany's main financial institutions had
begun the process of transformation in their trading cultures, but now this
process is being accelerated. Deutsche Bank's non-Deutschmark operations
have been consolidated with Morgan Grenfell. Dresdner Bank is learning the
ropes from new investment banking subsidiary Kleinwort Benson. Other German
banks are following suit. <BR>
<BR>
The greatest challenge for Frankfurt is to halt the decline by creating
an environment that will attract the best traders and salespeople with international
experience. Local bankers have learned from Frankfurt's poor record that
it is almost obligatory to gain career experience in other international
centres before returning to a senior position in the city. In the past,
talented locals, impatient to make more rapid progress than that permitted
by the formal hierarchies at big German banks, went to US investment houses
to build their careers. Indeed, the Frankfurt offshoots of Salomon Brothers,
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and their peers have evolved since the late
1980s by recruiting talented personnel from Germany's big banks. <BR>
<BR>
Yet over the past two years, the tables have turned. The bulge-bracket firms
have begun to consolidate and even to shed staff in Germany. Consequently,
a number of young, experienced Germans have returned to senior positions
at traditional German houses. <BR>
<BR>
One prominent example is Leonhard Fischer, who left JP Morgan in Frankfurt
last year to become co-head of trading and treasury at Dresdner Bank. Fischer,
32, has gained acceptance at highly traditional Dresdner by acknowledging
corporate culture while simultaneously increasing trading profits. It's
a similar story with Alfred M&ouml;ckl, who was head of equities at Morgan
Stanley in Frankfurt before being appointed as one of the managing partners
of respected German merchant bank BHF-Bank. And Morgan Stanley's London
operation was the training ground for two more of Frankfurt's chief traders:
Erich Pohl, co-head of treasury and trading at Dresdner Bank and J&uuml;rgen
Karcher, head of trading at Commerzbank. <BR>
<BR>
The change in culture perhaps has been most striking at Dresdner. Its traders
now are permitted to take a much more imaginative approach on positioning
because management recognizes that spreads in regular trading have become
too tight to yield substantial earnings. <BR>
<BR>
This is possible only because the level of capital-markets expertise in
Frankfurt has increased enormously. &quot;Germany used to be like the Third
World in finance,&quot; says a US-born trader at a major German bank. &quot;A
lot of us felt like the new sheriff in town because we had practical experience
in products. But there are now a lot more experienced people, even in junior
positions. Everyone is of a higher calibre than a few years back.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The pace of change in the Frankfurt market appeals to some traders. &quot;What
took 25 years in the US has happened in five years here because of the DTB
(Deutsche Terminb&ouml;rse, Frankfurt's electronic derivatives exchange),&quot;
says Alan Rogen, an equity-derivatives trader at ABN-Amro in Frankfurt.
&quot;The market has become far more efficient; there's better turnover
but smaller margins.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
William Klein, American head of capital markets and securities at Landesbank
Sachsen, says: &quot;In the past, German financial institutions suffered
from a lack of service and customer orientation. Up to now, German corporate
culture showed that it couldn't be as flexible or as innovative as in London.&quot;
He says he hopes that his bank, established three years ago and employing
60 staff in capital markets, will break that mould. <BR>
<BR>
Klein earlier worked in Frankfurt as head of derivatives trading at Schr&ouml;der
M&uuml;nchmeyer Hengst. It is from usual to see non-Germans arrive direct
from London, New York or Chicago and find management positions at German
institutions. <BR>
<BR>
However international their clientele, the big banks (regarded traditionally
as Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerzbank) are still formal hierarchies and
they almost invariably recruit Germans for senior positions. This means
non-Germans are unlikely to find management positions - and even if they
do - salaries are usually not comparable with London. Despite some improvement
in the past couple of years, Frankfurt traders and salespeople still earn
significantly less than their London equivalents. <BR>
<BR>
Historically this was not an issue. Until the early 1990s, few German traders
complained about pay because insider trading was widely regarded as a form
of supplementary income. But now every trading room in Germany has a compliance
department and traders are acutely aware that the first conviction has recently
been made under a new law against insider dealing. <BR>
<BR>
Traders and salespeople also are being more easily persuaded to move from
one institution to another as the jobs market becomes more transparent and
pay levels begin to rise. As a result, trading houses are beginning to realize
that if they expect staff to be honest and to remain loyal, they will have
to pay more. <BR>
<BR>
Here, differences are opening up between German houses. Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell (DMG), in particular, has begun to increase both salaries and bonuses
and to demand more in return. Although traders and salespeople know that
they still do not earn as much as their colleagues in London, management
is trying to quash or avoid such comparisons. &quot;You're fired if you
discuss money with each other,&quot; says one DMG trader. <BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, the Frankfurt trading fraternity acknowledged that Deutsche
Bank paid lower salaries than houses with lesser names because it was seen
as an honour to work there, so the theory went. According to DMG traders
in Frankfurt, that philosophy persists. They believe that experience at
DMG gives them particularly good job prospects, at least in the German market,
so less pay is accepted as part of the package. <BR>
<BR>
At Commerzbank, until two years ago, a trader's bonus was practically a
fixed sum paid regardless of performance. While basic salary has remained
the same, now traders and salespeople who do well can earn a substantially
larger bonus. The same is true of Bayerische Vereinsbank, though some other
German banks stick to the traditional system of small, fixed bonuses. <BR>
<BR>
According to Klein of Landesbank Sachsen, salaries for traders have been
rising since the beginning of the 1990s, but the increases have been particularly
steep in the past two years. The implications for his institution are profound.
Even though Landesbank Sachsen is based in Leipzig, where the cost of living
is significantly lower than Frankfurt, management feels obliged to pay Frankfurt
salaries to persuade qualified capital-markets staff to work in the eastern
German city. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, traders realize that good jobs in Frankfurt have become scarce.
Most complain that there are too many traders chasing too few clients. This
has somewhat dampened pay expectations. However, for the top positions,
financial rewards in Frankfurt are as good as anywhere. Germany's leading
banks have shown that they are willing to pay large salaries to secure the
likes of Fischer and Karcher. <BR>
<BR>
According to traders, the highest rank-and-file salaries in Frankfurt are
paid by the German offshoots of US investment banks. In return, those institutions
are more ruthless than the native German institutions about dismissing traders
who fail to attain their targets. &quot;We don't get paid huge bonuses,
but then again, we don't get fired unless we do something really bad, really
devious,&quot; says a trader at Commerzbank. <BR>
<BR>
While the working pace at Commerzbank or DMG in Germany remains more relaxed
than at their London or New York operations, US houses insist on the same
working habits in all their offices. Staff are expected to keep the same
hours and achieve the same targets as colleagues in New York and London.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I've done everything I can to avoid adapting to Frankfurt and to retain
my working habits from London; after all, I know I'll be going back some
day,&quot; says Friedrich von Nathusius, head of fixed income at Morgan
Stanley's German operation. &quot;I don't start at eight-thirty (seven-thirty
in London) just because I'm in Frankfurt. Lunch is for wimps.&quot; According
to Nathusius, his bank's Frankfurt operation works the same hours as London,
staying an hour later in the evening to conform to London times. <BR>
<BR>
For those who've once worked in London, it can be a tough decision to return
to Frankfurt. Nathusius spent seven years in London and bemoans the fact
that his compatriots often have to take a pay cut to return home. Although
the international houses such as Morgan Stanley pay approximately the same
pre-tax salaries in the two cities, Germany's punitive income tax means
that employees end up with substantially less in their pockets. <BR>
<BR>
Nathusius urges Frankfurt's city development agency to lobby the German
government to allow offshore-type contracts. That arrangement would allow
financial specialists who come to Frankfurt for just a few years to retain
their foreign tax status or to enjoy special tax breaks. As yet, however,
neither the city nor the German government has taken this suggestion on
board. <BR>
<BR>
But the choice between Frankfurt and London is also one of lifestyle, which
weighs very heavily with traders. On the one hand, London is still perceived
to offer more career opportunities and more rapid progression than Frankfurt.
It is often pointed out that London has 600,000 people working in financial
services while the same number represents Frankfurt's entire population.
London enthusiasts are also scornful about the absence in Frankfurt of a
service culture, the restricted German shopping hours and the limited range
of cultural and leisure pursuits in the area. It is telling that several
board members of major Frankfurt banks, including Deutsche, Dresdner and
Helaba, have chosen to reside in London or in the nearby Surrey countryside
and to commute weekly to work in Frankfurt. <BR>
<BR>
However, life in Frankfurt offers far shorter commuting times from pleasant
semi-rural villages outside the city. Safety and a better family life are
also considerations for many salespeople and traders, who tend on average
to be older than those in London. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers with a family to support are also attracted to the spirit of paternalism
which German banks still retain. Vereinsbank's Frankfurt staff who declined
to move to Bavaria when the bank relocated most trading to Munich last year
were not simply ordered to resign but were given generous redundancy pay.
<BR>
<BR>
Given German labour laws, however, it could be that Vereinsbank had little
choice. Indeed, German traders and salespeople who otherwise live by the
rules of the market usually take full advantage of Germany's generous employment
legislation if their employer threatens dismissal. It means large severance
payments - and sometimes even forced reinstatement. Most Frankfurt traders
would be shocked to see a dismissed colleague being handed a black bag and
given five minutes to clear their workspace before being escorted off the
premises. <BR>
<BR>
Even in sales positions, it is not unusual for those who resign to be kept
on for weeks or even months, since under a German employment contract, it
usually takes around nine months for an employee to break free of their
old job. <BR>
<BR>
In the past, Commerzbank traders who handed in their resignation used to
be retained for between six and nine months, until the end of their notice
period. Nowadays, they leave within a week or two. But management is still
remarkably unconcerned about the possibility that the departing trader might
act irresponsibly or deliberately lose money for his former employer. <BR>
<BR>
Given this level of paternalism, loyalty to employers in Frankfurt is much
greater than in London. <BR>
<BR>
Outside Frankfurt, traders often do not have the option to switch employers
for a significantly higher salary. The major German houses are scattered
all over the country - in Berlin (Bankgesellschaft Berlin), Munich (Vereinsbank,
Hypo-Bank), Dusseldorf (WestLB, Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt) and even, in the
case of L-Bank, in the provincial town of Karlsruhe. In those centres, discontented
traders and sales people have few other career options. <BR>
<BR>
It remains to be seen whether Vereinsbank's relatively isolated trading
centre on the outskirts of Munich can sustain the same efficiency as a Frankfurt
trading room. However, in the absence of similar alternative trading employment
in the Munich region, Vereinsbank is unlikely to experience the degreee
of staff turnover than it might have done in Frankfurt. &quot;Those who
don't want to leave Munich would certainly have trouble finding other jobs,&quot;
says Philip Waldstein, head of primary-market syndications. Indeed, greater
staff loyalty is said to have been one of the crucial factors when Vereinsbank
decided to relocate almost all its trading to Munich. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Location is completely irrelevant,&quot; says Waldstein. &quot;We
are just as professional as those in other centres. And when traders in
London want to communicate, they do just the same as us: they reach for
the phone or watch the screen.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But by arguing that the Bavarian countryside is just as good as Frankfurt
or London, Vereinsbank is undermining Frankfurt's central argument that
the German capital markets must consolidate their expertise to compete with
other centres. Most bankers agree that the multiplicity of financial centres
in Germany has hindered Frankfurt's chances of becoming stronger. Many hope
that the demise of the seven regional stock exchanges will advance the cause
of unity. <BR>
<BR>
Yet Frankfurt's ambitions remain modest, as summed up by Nathusius of Morgan
Stanley: &quot;When Germany's stock-market trading is finally consolidated
in one centre, then Frankfurt will be able to play second fiddle to London.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>

<H2><A NAME="terminal"></A>A terminal case . . . </H2>
<H4>The DTB was quick off the mark to form a network of terminals outside
home base to allow easy access to German derivative instruments. It wants
to challenge Liffe for supremacy in Europe. Rupert Gordon-Walker examines
how the battle lines are drawn </H4>
Frankfurt's response to the European Union Investment Services Directive
gives the clearest indication yet of its strategy in the run-up to monetary
union. The directive, effective from January 1996, allows EU members free
access to each others' financial markets. <BR>
<BR>
The Deutsche Terminb&ouml;rse (DTB), which was integrated into the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange (Deutsche B&ouml;rse) last year, has been first off the mark
by forming a network of terminals throughout the continent, linked to its
electronic Integrated Exchange, Trading and Information System (IBIS). Traders
and investors in German derivative instruments will have easy access to
the central DTB, which will make it harder for rival exchanges, such as
the UK's Liffe, to attract a share of its business. <BR>
<BR>
At issue are the relative merits of electronic screen-based trading, practised
by the DTB, and the open-outcry method practised by Liffe, the Matif and
the Chicago exchanges. <BR>
<BR>
To counteract the threat from Liffe the DTB was created in 1990 when Frankfurt
realized it needed a futures and options exchange if it was going to be
a serious contender for the position of Europe's financial centre. Since
then start-up activity has grown tenfold, with more than 300,000 contracts
traded daily on its electronic screens last year. <BR>
<BR>
In contrast to Liffe, the DTB has no booths to rent out, so transaction
fees make up the bulk of the exchange's income. It charges a Dm2 commission
for each equity index trade and 50 pfennings for an interest rate deal -
slightly more than the fees on US exchanges. The electronic trading system
forms the DTB's roots - and they are growing. <BR>
<BR>
Five London-based companies have already established links to the DTB: Spear
Leeds &amp; Kellog, Saratoga, FCT Europe and subsidiaries of the German
banks Landesbank Hessen-Th&uuml;ringen (Helaba) and Commerzbank. Stefan
Lutz, a vice-president of the Deutsche B&ouml;rse expects three more to
follow. Link-ups have also been formed in Switzerland, but the greatest
investment has been in Paris, where 15 screens are now operating. <BR>
<BR>
Negotiations between the DTB and the Matif (the French financial futures
exchange) for closer cooperation and integration have not been smooth and
agreement remains uncertain. In December 1993, the two exchanges made an
arrangement for electronic trading of two of each other's products. In September
1994, DTB offered the Bund (Bundesanleihen) and Bobl (Bundesobligationen)
contracts, but pressure from locals on the French exchange - who feared
that ending the open-outcry system would destroy their livelihoods - meant
that the Matif failed to reciprocate. <BR>
<BR>
Discussions were stalled until last spring, when a broader understanding
was reached between the Paris bourse and the Frankfurt stock exchange, which
had by then absorbed the DTB. If the agreement goes ahead this month, Frankfurt
will supply the technology for electronic trading in both derivative markets
and Paris will supply the systems for equity trading in each centre. Lutz
says there are a couple of alternative systems if things go wrong. Nevertheless,
the intention is clear: to expand the number of users of DTB products and
integrate the trading of those products within the DTB. <BR>
<BR>
The DTB's primary focus has been equity products. Dealings in the option
contract on the Dax index of 30 blue-chip companies is now one of the most
active worldwide. In January, 2.8 million contracts were traded - 140,000
each trading day. In addition, futures and futures options on the index
are available, but more broadly-based indices, CDAX (all stocks) and Faz
(top 100), have been disappointing because of poor turnover in the underlying
shares. Trading in Dax products accounts for 60% of the DTB's annual turnover.
<BR>
<BR>
At the end of last year, the Deutsche B&ouml;rse made its first penetration
into the US market. The American Stock Exchange agreed to trade warrants
on the Dax index in a pilot project which, if successful, should lead to
trading in more liquid German instruments using DTB technology. <BR>
<BR>
Liffe has a distinctly different strategy. &quot;Its aim is to strengthen
its position as the leading international futures and options exchange in
Europe,&quot; says Ralf Herkoltz, the German managing director for business
development at Liffe. Last year the exchange made an agreement with the
Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange (Tiffe) to trade the three-month
Euroyen <BR>
contract after Tokyo closes for the day, forged a link with Singapore's
Simex and made a reciprocal arrangement with the Chicago Board of Trade
(CBOT) for Liffe to trade US treasury instruments before Chicago opens and
for the CBOT to trade UK gilt derivatives after London closes. Liffe also
has plans to offer commodity futures and is currently in negotiation with
the London Commodity Exchange (LCE). <BR>
<BR>
Although Liffe poses no serious threat to DTB's domination of Dax contracts
- and the creation of an electronic network is designed to pre-empt a challenge
- there is competition for control of trading in German interest-rate instruments.
<BR>
<BR>
Liffe fired the first shot in this skirmish when it began trading the 10-year
Bund futures contract in 1988, two years earlier than the DTB, and thus
established a &quot;first-mover advantage&quot; (first in the market), according
to Herkoltz. Last year, volume traded on the floor reached 32.23 million
contracts, 72% of the instrument's worldwide turnover. Liffe regularly has
taken a 70% share for the past four years. Lutz hopes that the expansion
of terminal points will send more of this business to DTB. <BR>
<BR>
To counter Liffe's advantage, and expand the range of domestic instruments
to cover the length of the German yield curve, the DTB introduced two new
contracts in March 1994. One was a short-term interest-rate futures contract:
three-month Fibor (Frankfurt interbank offer rate), to rival the Eurodeutschmark
contract traded on Liffe. Fibor has since gained credibility as a hedging
tool and has driven demand for interest-rate swaps and forward-rate agreements.
It has proved more successful than the DTB's long-term interest-rate innovation,
the Buxl, which was <BR>
suspended because of poor liquidity caused, say dealers, by a limited supply
of underlying 15-30 year government bonds. <BR>
<BR>
First-mover advantage for the five-year Bobl contract was achieved by the
DTB, however. The contract belatedly was introduced by Liffe in 1992 but
during the following year managed only one million contracts and was delisted
in September 1994. <BR>
<BR>
In contrast to the five-year French Btan futures contract, which failed
to take off and was suspended by the Matif in 1993, the Bobl shows signs
of growth. In January, volume on the DTB leapt to more than 100,000 a day,
fuelled by Dm26 billion of Eurodeutschmark issuance, part of which needed
to be hedged. But as Amr Mounib, head of Eurobond trading at ABN-Amro in
Amsterdam, points out, traders often prefer to use the more liquid 10-year
futures contract for hedges on five-year cash deals, duration weighting
the purchase or sale to reduce the mismatch. <BR>
<BR>
But according to many in the market the fight between the DTB and Liffe
is physical. Put simply, bond traders prefer open-outcry. Mounib, for instance,
complains that the Bobl contract on the DTB's screens is often illiquid.
&quot;It is fine if I want to deal in the 200-to-300 range but I lose five
ticks if I try to complete 1,000 contracts and 10 or more if my order is
2,000 to 3,000.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A government bond dealer at a German bank says it is almost impossible to
deal during volatile conditions. &quot;After news that is particularly market-sensitive,
everyone pulls their bids and offers, so I have no chance to fill my stop
order. After the dust has settled the market can open half a point away
either side from where it was trading.&quot; Leaving an order with a local
or a bank's floor trader is often more efficient and flexible because if
the trader is good he will know the clearing level for other dealers' orders.
<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, investors prefer screen-based trading, according Lutz
at the Deutsche B&ouml;rse. In a volatile market they have problems placing
orders with brokers and even greater difficulties transacting business on
open-outcry exchanges. Advertising a bid or offer on-screen at least has
the advantage of transparency, which increases the chances of filling an
order. <BR>
<BR>
These largely idological battles will affect the success of the DTB's plans.
This sucess will rest largely on its ability to convince traders that they
can achieve comparable or superior liquidity by using its screens. Otherwise,
international exchanges, especially its European rival, Liffe, will attract
greater volume in existing contracts and might even introduce contracts
on German equity products. <BR>
<BR>
The Deutsche B&ouml;rse has been encouraged by the support given to its
DTB operation by the three biggest German banks - Deutsche Bank, Dresdner
Bank and Commerzbank. Dresdner Bank, in particular, has pushed hard for
Frankfurt, concentrating its futures trading on the exchange and marketing
the DTB to investors throughout Europe. The strategy may be working. On
some days, volumes traded on the DTB by leading US investment houses such
as Goldman Sachs and Saloman Brothers surpass the activity of German banks.
<BR>
<BR>
But the battle is far from over. If the DTB is going to achieve a niche
- and really challenge Liffe - the expansion and sustainability of that
trend is essential. <BR>

<H2>Good gearing </H2>
Sponsoring professional bicycle-racing teams has one clear advantage. Your
name is not only on the bike riders' jerseys, but you also buy the name
of the team. <BR>
<BR>
Financial institutions have joined the colourful pack of pedalling ads that
was formerly dominated by manufacturers, retailers, charities and pressure
groups. Most famous is Spanish bank Banesto - its team leader, Miguel
Indurain, has won the three-week-long Tour de France (the most prestigious
stage race) for five consecutive years and is the hot tip to do so again
next month. Banesto claims his winning streak has drawn in more retail deposits,
while the bank has milked the connection in its promotions. But not always
successfully. A Spanish housewife who won &quot;Big Mig's&quot; 1995 Tour
bike in a Banesto prize draw didn't know what to do with it. She complained
it was blocking her hallway. <BR>
<BR>
A pro bike team is a relatively cheap, high-profile publicity vehicle, particularly
in western Europe. A team in the 22-strong first division (there are more
than 60 pro squads in total) runs on, at most, $10 million a year. That
guarantees your name exposure from February to October on public roads in
half-a-dozen countries. On big one-day events and major stage races, such
as the Tour de France, there's also extensive TV and press coverage. <BR>
<BR>
Other financials with teams include insurers - France's GAN and the
Netherlands' TVM - and, since the beginning of the 1996 season, Rabobank,
the Netherlands' triple-A, number two bank. Troubled French bank Cr&eacute;dit
Lyonnais takes a different approach. Each summer it casts aside gloom and
sponsors the Tour de France's overall classification. This not only means
cash prizes for the riders - Ffr5.52 million ($1.06 million) in 1995.
Each day attractive young women in CL uniforms support the race leader on
the podium, presenting him with his CL-emblazoned yellow jersey, kisses
and a large toy CL lion. Belgium's Kredietbank takes a similar but more
low-key role in the one-day Ronde van Vlaanderen. <BR>
<BR>
Rabobank is putting money into revitalizing Dutch cycle racing, with the
2000 Olympics in mind. Like its sponsor, the team is solid (ranked number
nine) but unexciting. In a 21-man squad, which includes 11 Dutch riders,
its three stars - Russia's Viatcheslav Ekimov, Denmark's Rolf S&ouml;rensen
and Belgium's Johan Bruyneel - have all won Tour de France stages and
one-day classics, but are unlikely to make an Indurain-style impact on the
deposit base. <BR>

<H2>Cheeky exit at Chase </H2>
It was a little surprising when Chase and Chemical chose Marbella, second
home of rich Saudis and fleeing British criminals, as the retreat for their
more senior regional and product executives to get to know each other. <BR>
<BR>
The first two days passed without incident, perhaps because the golf is
good. An intense programme of strategic sessions and speeches went down
well, with executives praising the worth of the exercise. The third day,
Saturday May 4, was largely a rest day, ending with a dinner. <BR>
<BR>
A number of staff admit to headaches and upset stomachs the day after this
bash, but at least one executive is nursing more than a hangover. Charles
Bauccio, Chase Investment Bank's head of eastern Europe, Middle East and
Africa, and a 27-year veteran of the bank, was allowed to resign shortly
after the get-together owing to his eccentric and unexpectedly extended
after-dinner speech. <BR>
<BR>
According to Chase sources, instead of the 10 minutes of gentle banter planned,
Bauccio launched into a lengthy and surreal anti-Chemical diatribe in which
he ranted against his new employers, reserving particular venom for his
new bosses, Don Layton and Arjun Mithrani. He then indulged his passion
for local dress - his enthusiastic adoption of Uzbek national costume
at the opening of Chase's Tashkent office was noted in last month's <I>Euromoney</I>
- by dropping his trousers. This revealed the kind of skimpy undergarments
more commonly seen on Marbella's beachfront. They were bikini bottoms. <BR>

<H2>Wie bitte? </H2>
Hansgeorg Hofmann, Dresdner Bank board member, has brought globalspeak to
Germany. He told the <I>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</I> in a recent interview.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wenn sich das Investmentbanking an einem Punkt in einem Zyklus befindet,
an dem es nicht mehr so profitabel sein w&uuml;rde, dann muss die urspr&uuml;ngliche
Investition immer noch vor dem Hintergrund der zweifelsohne hohen Synergieeffekte
f&uuml;r die k&uuml;nftige Positionierung unseres Hauses als Universalbank
gesehen werden.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Translation: &quot;If investment banking finds itself at a point in a cycle
where it is not so profitable, then the original investment must be seen
against the background of the undoubted synergy effects for the future positioning
of our house as a universal bank.&quot; Alles klar.<B> <BR>

<H2>Music to forex traders' ears </H2>
Frankfurt's hotels were full during one week in May as visitors swarmed
in for performances by Placido Domingo - and Manfred Kunert, global
head of treasury at DG Bank. <BR>
<BR>
Alongside his role of impresario at dealers' jamboree Forex '96, Kunert
also wrote and staged the world's first musical about the forex markets,
performed on the final evening of the conference. &quot;There have been
musicals about love, war, even earthquakes, but never about our profession,&quot;
he explains. <BR>
<BR>
Set on a forex desk somewhere in Europe, the musical takes a romantic view
of how a small group of dealers decide on a whim to buy dollars (the Asian
market was closed, and they have no ideas), and soon start losing. As the
dollar plunges, the dealers remain upbeat, since &quot;The first loss is
the cheapest&quot;. On his knees, the quiffed chief dealer croons, &quot;What
a mess, oh, what a shame/ But it is a must/ Staying in the trading game/
Until one goes bust.&quot; Then the dealers decide: &quot;Let's call the
central bank and fill up her reserves/ Then we can laugh again and show
that we've got the nerve.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Enter the central bank, dressed as Superman: &quot;Oh, there she is, thank
God, the central bank is in/ At last we get a chance to make this loss a
win/ Let us be generous and fill her up like mad/ Now she's the best friend
that we dealers ever had.&quot; Later, the gleeful central bank joins in
the chorus as the US twin deficit turns into a surplus and obliges her to
sell greenbacks. <BR>
<BR>
According to Kunert, all this was a fair portrayal of life in the forex
markets. &quot;There's no moral. I wrote the musical to remind people what
a day on the markets can be like. It's 70 per cent luck.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Later, Kunert presented the Superman cape to Gerald Grisse, recently appointed
head of forex at the Bundesbank. &quot;I told the central bankers beforehand
that they shouldn't take it amiss, but in fact they were delighted. In an
atmosphere like that, after so many drinks, you can do anything.&quot; <BR>

<H2>Riding the debt train </H2>
Malicious pranksters have been making life hell for East Japan Railway.
Commuter services to Tokyo have been disrupted by a washing machine and
a bicycle placed across the tracks, and bogus stink bombs let off in carriages,
with passengers thinking they are being poisoned by a doomsday religious
cult. <BR>
<BR>
But the real railway terror lies in the unfinished &quot;privatization&quot;
of the old Japanese National Railways (JNR), where a bankruptcy is approaching
faster than a bullet train. <BR>
<BR>
Under its charter, the JNR Settlement Corporation has only two years left
to liquidate &#165;27.58 trillion ($256 billion) in debt. In 1987 when the
Japanese railway network was &quot;privatized&quot; and split into six regional
passenger rail companies, one freight operator, and various smaller units,
JNR Settlement took over two-thirds of the total JNR debt of &#165;37.1
trillion ($345 billion). <BR>
<BR>
Far from eradicating the debt through land and asset sales of &#165;25.5
trillion - as intended - the JNR Settlement Corporation has allowed
it to grow by &#165;2 trillion. <BR>
<BR>
Unless the private rail companies are to be crippled by assuming this colossal
obligation, the government will have to wipe the slate clean by raising
taxes, issuing bonds or, almost inevitably, by taking a hit that will cost
each and every Japanese - even in Okinawa, where there are no railways
- about &#165;160,000 ($1,485). <BR>
<BR>
The biggest fiasco is only about 10 minutes' walk from the MOF castle: a
20-hectare expanse of gravel and mud on the east side of Shimbashi station
in the centre of Tokyo. At the height of the 1980s &quot;bubble&quot;, JNR
Settlement could have sold the land for &#165;4 to &#165;5 trillion. If
it were sold now, the Shimbashi site would probably raise &#165;500 billion
to &#165;600 billion. In the meantime, this diadem in the JNR debt crown
has been used to host the musical <I>Cats</I> in a marquee, and has been
excavated with the archaeological discovery of some 300-year-old wooden
plumbing. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile at JNR Settlement, its 2,000 employees, whose average age is 52,
are wondering about the future. &quot;The more success we have with the
sale of JNR land, the sooner I'll have to leave this job. I feel like an
octopus that keeps nibbling away at its own tentacles to survive,&quot;
says one. Interest payments are &#165;3.8 billion a day. <BR>

<H2>A safe as big as the Ritz </H2>
If you're overweight in Indian paper, Citibank has the solution. Its branch
in Bombay is now perfectly placed to take the stuff off your hands. <BR>
<BR>
Your problem probably began, like Citibank's, in 1993 when the Indian government
opened up the markets to international investors, but didn't change the
number of shares per certificate: this remains at either five, 10, 50 or
100. &quot;We had a vault of 900 square feet,&quot; says Rajiv Das, business
manager of Citibank in Bombay, &quot;but with volumes going through the
roof, we were inundated with paper.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Citi needed a new safe. Or rather, two new safes, with a combined area of
3,500 square feet. They needed to be cash-standard vaults, under internal
and US regulations, conforming to specifications no Indian manufacturer
could meet. <BR>
<BR>
Enter the Acme Safe Company of New York. <BR>
<BR>
The logistics of the operation were horrendous, according to Sid Stone,
security consultant at Acme. The pillar-filled basement in which the larger
vault was to go had &quot;a thousand different dimensions&quot;. The safe
was constructed in 450 pieces of eight-inch (20cm) thick concrete, none
of which could be altered in any way once shipping had started. All together
they weigh 800,000lb (350,000kg). They were packed into 19 flat-rack containers
- the bulk of a medium-sized ship - and shipped from the factory
in Miami to Bombay. At Bombay, the Citibank site could cope only with one
or two of these containers at a time, and Bombay traffic restrictions meant
that they could be moved only at night. Furthermore, the basement where
the vault was being installed needed extensive work. <BR>
<BR>
The process took about four months. <BR>

<H3>KERR'S PEOPLE </H3>
<H4>IAN KERR </H4>
<H2>George Cornelissen </H2>
<H4>Executive vice-president, global fixed-income and derivative markets,
ABN Amro Hoare Govett</H4> 
The Dutch are coming. More than 300 years ago that cry incited panic along
the south coast of England as Dutch admirals, including Van Tromp (he with
the broom tied to his mast to sweep the English from the sea) and De Ruyter,
regularly ran rings round a tired and ill-equipped home fleet. Now the Dutch
are here and like Van Tromp and De Ruyter are making waves. ING bought Barings.
Dutch pension funds have been major buyers of prime commercial property
in London. ABN Amro, rich and ambitious, certainly looked at SG Warburg
and even more closely at Barings but came away empty-handed. <BR>
<BR>
But ABN Amro isn't shedding any tears. Also, the bank had its hands full
in London without having to go through the laborious &quot;nursemaid&quot;
experience of managing the sensitivities of a newly-acquired foreign bank.
ABN Amro was already in London. In fact, it was all over London, which was
just one of the problems: it had three offices in the City. <BR>
<BR>
Then there was Hoare Govett (acquired by Security Pacific in the mid-1980s
and sold to ABN Amro in 1991) which was a consistent money-maker but was
located in yet another office and operated with almost total independence.
<BR>
<BR>
Back in Amsterdam HQ, there were already plans afoot which not only would
integrate the offices but also create a capital-markets operation based
in London to take on the world. The architects behind the strategy to build
a blockbuster bond house were Dolf Van den Brink, senior executive vice-president
and a member of the management committee for investment banking and global
clients, and George Cornelissen, executive VP and head of global fixed-income
derivatives. <BR>
<BR>
The plan, initiated only two years ago, was simple. ABN Amro already held
a dominant position in guilder-denominated bonds with around 48% of the
domestic market. Given its excellent skills in foreign exchange, options
and futures, there was an opportunity for Cornelissen's group to develop
a bond-trading and derivatives operation which would become one of the bank's
largest revenue producers. <BR>
<BR>
Certainly the ABN Amro Group has formidable in-house fire-power. The merger
of Algemene Bank and Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank had created a bank with assets
of Dfl506 billion. It also has more than 1,000 domestic branches, another
627 branches in 67 countries and 65,800 employees. And just to add icing
to the cake, the thrifty Dutch savers provide ABN Amro with a retail customer
base which even Swiss bankers admire. <BR>
<BR>
Having streamlined all of the bank's fixed-income operations into single
reporting lines (offices and branches no longer compete with each other)
the group is now a primary dealer in most of the major currency markets.
<BR>
<BR>
Cornelissen has also been waving the bank's ample chequebook to attract
top capital-market specialists. Ian Abrams and Sam Berwick were hired from
Nomura. Jonathan Greenwood was poached from Goldman Sachs to head syndication
and origination. Christine Dare and a team came from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
to specialize in private placements and structured products. <BR>
<BR>
The results of the Cornelissen plans are beginning to show. Recently ABN
Amro Hoare Govett was ranked eighth in the league tables for new international
fixed-income issues. And no longer is the bank perceived as solely a guilder
house. This year it has been a lead manager for offerings denominated in
Deutschmarks, sterling and dollars. <BR>
<BR>
For Cornelissen, this has been a long ordeal by fire. The ABN Amro name
had been seriously diluted in the Euromarkets during the late 1980s. &quot;They
almost disappeared completely,&quot; says a veteran trader from CS First
Boston. Now, the bank's trading operations in London, masterminded by Dominic
Hubble and Carl Holt, have made it a leading player in non-guilder securities
markets with secondary trading volume in, say, Deutschmarks sometimes exceeding
that of Deutsche Bank. Soon it will become a primary dealer in the US treasury
market. &quot;A natural extension, given our current trading volume in treasuries
and the overall strength of the New York securities operation,&quot; says
Abrams, now deputy managing director. <BR>
<BR>
Cornelissen, 52, has spent his entire career with the bank. Colleagues applaud
his instinctive understanding of the most complex ideas and the development
of new financial instruments. Perhaps his expertise is drawn from his family
trading roots (he began his ABN Amro career dealing in foreign exchange
and Euro-deposits) which go back to Cornelissen &amp; Van Droge, founded
by his grandparents at the turn of the century. <BR>
<BR>
The father of two teenagers, Cornelissen skis and plays tennis. And like
many Dutch bankers, he is a lover of good food. Not only that - he's
also a skilled chef. His specialities are French and Italian dishes. However,
we have already booked ourselves in for his Dutch domestic dishes of <I>hutspot,
hete bliksem, blinde vinken</I> followed by <I>kaassoesjes</I>. <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H2>Michael Phair </H2>
<H4>Co-head of telecoms corporate finance, UBS</H4> 
Turn the clock back five years. Look at UBS in London. Disorganization was
the rule of the day before Rudi Mueller made his mark. There was a good
treasury and foreign exchange business, an admired asset management operation
and in international bond issues UBS was always there or thereabouts in
the top 10 on the leader-board. <BR>
<BR>
But where were the UBS investment bankers? &quot;To be brutally honest,
they simply didn't have the right people,&quot; says a managing director
of a leading UK merchant bank. <BR>
<BR>
But times change. Under Malcolm Le May as head of corporate finance, there
is a new sense of urgency about the division. No longer are UBS investment
bankers labelled as also-rans and no-hopers. <BR>
<BR>
Look at the numbers for confirmation. In the first quarter of this year
UBS was ranked first among financial advisers for UK public takeovers and
mergers, according to<I> Acquisitions Monthly</I>. The bank was involved
in five transactions valued at almost &#163;4.5 billion. No doubt UBS will
be delighted by that performance, especially in the intensely competitive
UK market where domestic houses are reluctant to cede an inch of turf. <BR>
<BR>
But the bank and Le May have broader international ambitions and more strings
to their bow. After more than a year of negotiations, Le May has persuaded
Michael Phair, 45, to leave NM Rothschild, where he was director in charge
of corporate finance for central and eastern Europe and other emerging markets,
to join UBS as head of telecoms banking. Phair is a prize catch. &quot;We've
had him in our sights for years but the feeling was that he would never
leave NMR,&quot; remarks a senior executive recruiter. Certainly Phair enjoyed
his eight years with the bank. &quot;The atmosphere was always vibrant,
intellectually challenging and fun,&quot; says the new UBS recruit. <BR>
<BR>
For NMR the loss of Phair takes out a recognized deal-maker and originator
from their front-line team. He joined the bank in 1988, initially developing
its activities in emerging-market funds for Latin America. Then, as NMR
sensed business opportunities in eastern Europe, he was chosen by Evelyn
de Rothschild to spearhead that effort. Among the London banks, NMR and
CS First Boston stole a two-year march on the competition in eastern Europe
which they exploited to the full. <BR>
<BR>
Despite Rothschild's notoriously tight-fisted budgets, Phair built a corporate
finance and advisory business which, dollar for dollar, was arguably the
best in central and eastern Europe. Business began to flow with deals including
the first Polish bank privatization and the restructuring and recapitalization
of Cesko-Slovenska Obchodni Banka. <BR>
<BR>
When NMR advised MATAV, the Hungarian state telephone company, on its privatization,
Phair immediately realized the growth potential in the telecom sector. Within
three years NMR was involved in telecom assignments in Canada, Cuba, the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Moldavia, Hungary, France, Russia, the UK and
Belgium. <BR>
<BR>
Which were the most memorable deals? Phair likes to think that he &quot;came
within a hair's breadth of completing the capitalist society's ultimate
dream&quot; in 1995, when he was poised to privatize the telecommunications
systems of Russia and Cuba. Looking back on that situation, Phair says:
&quot;I wonder what president John F Kennedy would have said?&quot; In fact
the Russian deal collapsed when the Russian government and the Italian government-owned
STET failed to agree final terms on December 22. <BR>
<BR>
Phair leaves NMR with an active calendar of deals outstanding. There are
assignments for telecom deals in Russia, the Czech Republic, Cuba and Hungary.
The globe-trotting Phair (he rarely spends more than three months a year
in London) was born in Canada and served as senior representative for Toronto
Dominion Bank's office in Mexico City before being head-hunted to become
president of Banque Anval in Panama at the age of 29. No stranger to flying
bullets and the sound of tanks in the streets, he can tell hair-raising
stories about life in Latin America, including one about following in the
wake of the Sandinistas in Managua to retrieve a deposit at the Nicaraguan
central bank. A three-year spell with the IFC in Washington honed his skills
as an investment banker and developed Phair's interest in emerging-market
funds, an interest which finally caught the attention of Rothschilds. <BR>
<BR>
Every inch the cosmopolitan investment banker, Phair is married to the stunning
Margot from Argentina. At their London home in Notting Hill Gate, conversation
with children Stephanie and Nicholas moves effortlessly between English,
French and Spanish. Surely it's not possible that there could be a chink
in this banker's armour as he prepares to move to UBS? Alas, it seems so.
According to Margot, his German and Schweizer-Deutsch are &quot;precisely
zero&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H2>Anders Bergendahl </H2>
<H4>Global co-head of debt capital markets, Merrill Lynch, London</H4> 
John McNiven is a tough act to follow. Step forward Anders Bergendahl who
succeeds him as co-head of Merrill's hugely successful debt capital markets
group in London. The position carries responsibility for all debt origination
and liability strategies throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
<BR>
<BR>
In a market where cult figures are deliberately stiffed and acts of supreme
bravado are preferably carried out behind locked doors, McNiven stood out
like a beacon. The feisty, no-nonsense Australian, who has been described
as &quot;the only amusing person to come out of JP Morgan in the last 10
years&quot;, had a charisma that overwhelmed most competitors and colleagues.
<BR>
<BR>
Under McNiven's direction, Merrill powered to the top of the fixed-income
league tables last year. As of mid-April this year, the bank was again back
in the lead, narrowly ahead of Morgan Stanley. <BR>
<BR>
Bergendahl's background is not fixed-income but investment banking. He has
no lurid tales of times as a mortgage-backed trader or life on the Brady
bond roller-coaster. Perhaps the nearest he came to being a true &quot;bondy&quot;
was an interview at Kidder Peabody Securities, then the premier Eurobond
trading house, in 1977. Kidder didn't offer him a job (thank your stars,
Anders) and instead he went to Merrill. <BR>
<BR>
Throughout his career at Merrill, Bergendahl has been closely involved with
his native Sweden and the Scandinavian region. When, during the 1980s, the
kingdom, the agencies and Swedish industrial companies were among the largest
borrowers in the international capital markets, he became fully familiar
with bond operations in all of the major currencies. Moreover, because Scandinavian
borrowers were among the most receptive to innovative ideas, Bergendahl
was involved directly in the marketing of new financial instruments and
new funding techniques. He was also in the thick of the 1980s M&amp;A boom
when Scandinavian companies, particularly Swedish corporations, embarked
on a buying spree in continental Europe and the US. <BR>
<BR>
Can Bergendahl make the transition from investment banking to running the
busiest capital markets house in Europe? He is remarkably self-assured.
Much of that confidence stems from the backlog of issues in Merrill's pipeline.
&quot;It's not just the volume but the diversity across currencies, countries
and types of borrowers which is the most encouraging,&quot; says Bergendahl.
<BR>
<BR>
When we mention Deutsche Morgan Grenfell as his main threat in the league
tables, Bergendahl's lack of concern is almost disparaging. &quot;We're
several billion ahead already and I doubt they have the quality of our pipeline.&quot;
Do league tables matter to him? &quot;Of course, because they are part of
the Merrill franchise,&quot; he responds. <BR>
<BR>
Bergendahl is delighted with Merrill's performance in the Swiss franc and
Deutschmark primary bond markets and hopes to improve its position in Eurosterling
bonds. Although this sector is highly competitive and fiercely defended
by the British banks, he sees the introductions and corporate contacts of
Smith New Court as a valuable entr&eacute;e. <BR>
<BR>
Still only 44, Bergendahl enjoys skiing, sailing, jogging, squash and tennis.
He is married with two young boys and two grown-up step-children. But what
about the question everyone wants to ask McNiven's successor - related
to those photographs of a smiling John in front of a gleaming Rolls-Royce
Corniche with the totally unassuming number plate, MCNIV? What are Bergendahl's
four wheels atttached to? &quot;I did have a car, a very ordinary family
car, but it was stolen and now I use taxis,&quot; he says. Surely the bank
can provide him with a suitable limo? &quot;The firm doesn't have a car
scheme,&quot; he tells us. <BR>

<H3>DEAL INSIDER</H3> 
<H2>Orange proves no lemon </H2>
 <H4>PETER LEE &amp; STEVEN IRVINE</H4>
<B>Issuer: Orange plc</B> <BR>
<B>Amount: $700 million</B> <BR>
<B>Type of deal: equity IPO</B> <BR>
<B>Completed: April 3</B> <BR>
<B>Lead managers: Goldman Sachs,</B> <BR>
<B>Dresdner-Kleinwort Benson</B> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'd like to know what is happening to your <I>arpoos</I>,&quot; asks
the female analyst. &quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; responds Hans Snook,
chief executive of Orange, wondering if this is a rude question. It's not.
&quot;Your RPUs - revenues per unit.&quot; A typical telecoms question.
<BR>
<BR>
But investors obviously liked the responses they got from Snook and his
team, because Orange, the UK mobile-phone company, which issued $700 million
of equity at the end of March, was 10 times oversubscribed - a result that
was all the more surprising because Orange has never made a pre-tax profit
and won't until 1998 or 1999. <BR>
Orange, the newest entrant to the UK mobile-phone market, and subject of
the largest IPO so far this year in the UK, remains a controversial stock
to value. Before its share offer was launched in March, investment banks
produced widely different valuations of the company, ranging from one hopeful
Japanese firm's estimate of &#163;3.9 billion ($5.9 billion) to a more sceptical
UK broker's &#163;1.7 billion. <BR>
<BR>
The float was talked about for six months before its official announcement.
This was because last August a UK newspaper got hold of the story when a
public relations firm leaked a letter inviting it to bid for the mandate.
<BR>
<BR>
The eventual winner of the communications mandate, Dewe Rogerson, suggested
it might be wise to change the name. The original intention had been to
float under the name Hutchison Telecommunications UK plc, a mouthful that
hardly throbbed with name recognition. Orange on the other hand, was a brand
name - and because of its &#163;30 million advertising campaign a well-known
one. <BR>
<BR>
Ironically many bankers and City types did not have Orange phones, however,
because it is very difficult to use them while travelling abroad. But Anthony
Carlisle, executive chairman of Dewe Rogerson, says word of mouth was just
as important. He recalls being at an Eric Clapton concert in London's Albert
Hall with Snook when the wife of a blue-chip company chief executive - unaware
who Snook was - began talking about the Orange thing that she had received
from her husband, and how wonderful it was. <BR>
<BR>
Partly for this reason, the decision was taken just after Christmas to include
a retail tranche, targeted at Orange's 400,000 subscribers. A total of 35,000
new small shareholders took up the offer, adding a total of &#163;156 million
to demand, just over a fifth. <BR>
<BR>
The shareholders and management decided that a float would serve two purposes:
to clear all shareholder loans, and to realize a valuation for the company
for the two shareholders - Hutchison Whampoa and British Aerospace. <BR>
<BR>
Lead managers Goldman Sachs and Dresdner-Kleinwort Benson, suggested a value
of around &#163;2.8 billion and eventually succeeded with a stock offer
valuing the company at &#163;2.45 billion. A total of &#163;700 million
was raised - including &#163;100 million from the fully exercised greenshoe.
<BR>
<BR>
Hans Snook's comment on the disparity between the valuation and the issue
price? &quot;The difference between a good price and a greedy price can
be narrow.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Many of the world's largest investors came on board. Over 1,100 placed orders
for the sale. Some of these were huge. The six largest lead orders for stock
would have been enough to complete the deal. Allocations - which followed
the UK treasury's model of ranking investors between one and five - saw
group one get 11% of their orders, and group five only 3%. <BR>
<BR>
These investors accepted brokers' methods for estimating the company's worth
using the discounted cashflow technique. Because it has been operating only
since April 1994 and is still investing in its network, Orange could not
be valued on a usual price-to-earnings model. Instead, analysts and investors
are looking forward to its likely cashflow and profit in three, five and
10 years' time, and using a discount rate to put a present value on those
cashflows. <BR>
It's a technique that is becoming more widely used to value early-stage
companies such as cable companies and projects like Eurotunnel and Eurodisney,
as well as emerging-market telephone companies. In Orange's case, investors
were being asked to pay up for future earnings very early in the company's
development. <BR>
<BR>
They did so for several reasons. Orange's management team has a clear strategy,
to build a national network using the latest digital technology with competitive
tariffs and an emphasis on customer service. It enjoys strong rates of growth
in attracting new subscribers, lower than average churn (subscribers handing
their phones back) and strong brand identity. <BR>
<BR>
Management did a good job of converting sceptical investors, especially
in one-on-one meetings during a gruelling three-week roadshow, which took
in 35 cities and 130 presentations. Group finance director Graham Howe laughs:
&quot;I don't think I would wish a roadshow process on anyone.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
By the end, even they had wearied of Orange's &quot;compelling investment
story&quot; to the extent that they attempted to reduce their presentations
to: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, the future's bright, the future's Orange
[the group's advertising slogan]. Are there are any questions?&quot; None
of the Americans laughed, so this did not last long. <BR>
<BR>
The deal went so smoothly that the scariest moment occurred not in a pricing,
or even an analysts' meeting but on a snowmobile in Lake Tahoe, California,
when - taking a weekend off - the chief executive nearly hospitalized himself
and his finance director by colliding with a large tree. <BR>
<BR>
Howe, the 35-year old finance director, might not have made it at all. The
schedule for the whole IPO was structured around the date his wife was expected
to have their second child. Like a Swiss train she performed with stunning
punctuality, and 8lb Jack Benjamin Howe was born at 8am on the morning the
prospectus was published, and they were readying themselves to leave for
Hong Kong. The birth was considered &quot;good joss&quot;, eight being a
lucky number in Asia - and both Howe and Snook having arrived at Orange
from Hutchison in Hong Kong, the significance of this was not lost on them.
<BR>
<BR>
The company rode its luck. The market was searching for growth stories.
A sell-off in technology stocks could have hurt it. None came. Even though
rival operator Vodafone cut its tariffs to hit back at Orange, its share-price
performance - Vodafone stock rose 10% from the announcement of Orange's
float to its pricing - helped the Orange deal. The deal was priced at 205p
per share, at the top of the indicated range, and immediately rose to 240p
in initial trading. <BR>
<BR>
Analysts are still split into two camps: those who love the stock and those
who hate the sector. Bears believe that competing mobile-phone companies
are edging towards a price war that will damage all of them. One UK analyst
still stands by his initial forecast for the share price of 140p (65p below
the issue price), even though it is likely to blip up again in June when
impending inclusion in the FT-SE index will create a shortage of stock.
<BR>
<BR>
But some of the bankers who worked closely on the transaction still sound
surprised at its sensational outcome. &quot;I wouldn't put my granny in
it,&quot; says one. &quot;This stock will do well for two years while users
switch from analogue to digital phones [Orange is based on the newer and
better digital technology]. The big question is what happens then.&quot;

<H3>FINANCIAL LAWYER </H3>
<p>
<H2>Making collateral secure</h2>
<BR>
<h4>
A new system for holding and transferring collateral for derivatives overcomes
the potential risk of third-party claimants. <BR>
By Christopher Stoakes </H4>
<font size=3>
Cedel Bank, the Luxembourg-based clearing organization, has unveiled the
Global Credit Support Service (GCSS), a new legal structure for holding
and transferring collateral interests in securities. Designed to cover all
credit exposures, GCSS will be particularly useful for counterparties to
swaps who may wish to have their transactions collateralized on a regular
mark-to-market basis. <BR>
<BR>
<B>N</B>either English nor New York law provides a completely fail-safe
system for holding or transferring a security interest across international
borders. If, in a derivatives transaction, party A goes bust, counterparty
B cannot be certain that A's receivers will give B's security interest in
the collateral provided by A (in another jurisdiction) priority over A's
other creditors. However, Luxembourg law recognizes the concept of the <I>fiduciaire</I>
(fiduciary). A fiduciary has legal title to the collateral which it holds.
If collateral provided by A for B's benefit were held by a fiduciary, then
A's receivers would be powerless to stop the fiduciary, as legal owner of
the collateral, from transferring it to B. It is this feature of Luxembourg
law which Cedel Bank is exploiting, in addition to sophisticated law on
book-entry securities custody and settlement. To understand the significance
of this, it is worth examining the way on-exchange derivatives trading occurs.
The clearing house imposes margin requirements on its members. It analyzes
each member's positions and arrives at a net margin requirement that will
protect the clearing house if that member defaults. <BR>
<BR>
The clearing house has no direct links with members' customers. The members
do have that contact: they protect themselves against the risk of a customer
defaulting by over-margining - that is, requiring more margin from the customer
than is due to the clearing house. <BR>
<BR>
While the clearing house nets the member's positions, the member often requires
a level of margin from each customer which assumes only some or no other
offsetting positions exists. Greater collateral is required by the member,
especially if it is providing a credit line to a customer to fund the customer's
margin obligations. If the member obtains a bank guarantee or a pledge of
securities from the customer, this reduces the capital the member is required
to put up by the regulators. But the problem with the collateral is that
part of what is pledged are the market positions themselves. But these are
intangibles and English law has difficulty applying a charge (the instrument
through which security is taken) to intangibles, although the US Uniform
Commercial Code (UCC) provides for registration of such a security interest.
<BR>
<BR>
The weakness in English law was recognized and addressed 10 years ago in
the Companies Act 1985, but only for the benefit of clearing houses and
exchanges. &quot;That's why LIFFE and the London Clearing House were protected
against Baring's collapse,&quot; explains Eric Bettleheim, who practises
English and New York law as a partner at Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt and also
specializes in derivatives. It was a committee chaired by him that was instrumental
in pushing through the 1985 amendment. <BR>
<BR>
Off-exchange swaps trading relies on netting under master agreements. The
four types of credit-support annex - New York UCC, English charge, English
set-off and transfer, and Japanese loan and pledge - recently published
by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, provide for collateral
to secure the netted obligations. Each party is otherwise dependent solely
on the ex-change of cash flows under the transaction. A credit-support annex
allows the parties to agree at what point the collateral kicks in - for
instance, when the mark-to-market swap falls below a given value or when
a party loses its current credit rating. But the credit-support annex is
only as good as the underlying legal systems that impinge on it. Hence the
significance of Cedel Bank's innovation with its new legal structure. <BR>
<BR>
<B>C</B>edel Bank is not offering itself as a clearing house for swaps but
as an agent for holding and managing swaps collateral. It will shuttle the
collateral back and forth between parties to reflect their res-pective positions,
leaving them free to carry on swaps trading under their existing agreements.
For instance, A enters into a fiduciary agreement with Cedel Bank and a
bilateral credit-support agreement with B. Under the fiduciary agreement,
Cedel Bank takes legal ownership of the assets pledged by A and records
B's interest in the assets in its books. Under a separate fiduciary agreement
with B, Cedel Bank agrees to transfer the assets to B on B's instruction.
Neither A nor its receiver can interfere with B's right of enforcement should
A default. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The parties don't report their trades, just the aggregated value of
each swaps master agreement,&quot; says Kathleen Tyson-Quah, senior corporate
counsel at Cedel Bank, &quot;nor does the system need standard valuations.
The parties enter their own valuations and set out, in the bilateral agreement,
the degree of tolerance allowed. So, for example, they may provide for splitting
the difference if their valuations are up to 5% apart. We value the collateral
daily and move securities and cash between them accordingly.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The difference between this and an on-exchange clearing house is that, as
Tyson-Quah says, &quot;a clearing house is only as strong as its weakest
member, whereas GCSS need not limit participation. The use of the fiduciary
structure overcomes most concerns about cross-border perfection of pledges
of securities collateral&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<B>W</B>ork on overcoming these problems continues. Important revisions
to the UCC are pending in key US states such as New York and California.
This month the Capital Markets Forum of the International Bar Association,
which brings together some of the leading lawyers in the field, will publish
a detailed discussion paper by Randall Guynn, a partner at Davis Polk &amp;
Wardwell. The paper covers the need for the international harmonization
of securities ownership, transfer and pledging laws. <BR>
<BR>
Arguing that the legal uncertainty surrounding collateral held by custodians
increases the cost of capital and reduces the value of the securities held,
Guynn upholds Luxembourg law and the revised UCC as models that other jurisdictions
could implement. &quot;Investors and secured creditors who hold interests
in securities through intermediaries [need] to be certain, once the governing
law has been ascertained, that they have a distinct package of rights that
cannot be successfully attacked by adverse claimants.&quot;

Sterling bursts into life
</H3>

THE sterling Eurobond this week burst into life on the back of a vigorous underlying government bond market. Amid a clutch of deals a &#163;250m BZW/HSBC-led issue for utility PowerGen stood out as investors queued up for a rare opportunity to buy 10-year corporate paper. 

<P>
NPI's &#163;100m issue provided novelty, with only the second bond issue for a UK mutual institution. 

<P>
Though the Eurodollar market saw its share of business, syndicate officials could point to few deals that stood out amid a welter of short-dated paper.  

<P>
In the FRN sector a Citibank/ HSBC-led syndicate managed to clear a $500m issue for Compagnie Bancaire at just inside fees. 

<P>
A clutch of French corporate names, including Essilor, Groupe Danone and St Gobain added welcome variety to the French franc market.

<P>
In contrast bankers described a Ffr3bn issue for Cr&eacute;dit Local as too tightly priced for the size, especially as many institutions are already heavy on the paper. 

<P>
Sweden made a double-handed entry into the market with a &#163;100m issue via Lehman and a DM750m bond through Daiwa and Deutsche. 

<P>
Among the issuers queuing to launch are the UK's Northumbrian Water, with a 10-year BZW-led issue of between &#163;200m and &#163;250m possibly as early as today (Friday). Price talk on the bond is mid to high-50s.

<P>
France's CCCI looks set to launch a &#163;250m floater at five years at around Libor plus 12bp next week. Cr&eacute;dit National may also follow its compatriot into the sterling market, although the DM sector may prove a more attractive alternative. In the dollar sector, NationsBank will launch its eagerly awaited FRN early next week.  

<P>
Meanwhile Bankgesellschaft Berlin aims to make its mark with a DM1bn issue at either five or seven years via CS First Boston and JP Morgan. And OKB may well tap the 10-year Deutschmark sector.&#009;*

<H2>Lessons in privatization </H2>
<H4>Despite difficult market conditions, there were significant privatization
successes in 1995. In general, privatizers were more circumspect in their
approach to the pricing, sizing, placement and timing of offers. <I>Euromoney</I>
journalists report on six countries' efforts in difficult markets, and their
future plans - followed by a list of major planned privatizations. <BR>

<H2>Yearning to bring it back home </H2>
After two years of protracted negotiations, Merrill Lynch earlier this year
celebrated its newly opened joint-venture securities operation in Jakarta.
Its liaison with local tycoon Hashim Djojohadikusmo, whose PT Persada Kian
Pasti Lestari owns 20% of the new firm, had helped it win Indonesia's two
most coveted privatization mandates to date - global coordinator on Indosat's
$1.16 billion offering in 1994 and joint global coordinator on last November's
$1.6 billion transaction for PT Telkom. Flush with over $50 million in fees
from these two deals, it threw a lavish binge. <BR>
<BR>
Catering was provided by the Grand Hyatt hotel, over $20,000 was spent on
repainting the courtyard at the National Museum venue and, for $150, the
services of a native &quot;rain-stopper&quot; were secured to prevent precipitation
from marring the open-air event. But while the rain stayed away, so did
the heavyweights of Indonesian business and finance. &quot;Despite Hashim's
high profile [he is president Suharto's son-in-law's brother], it was a
big no-show. Telecommunications minister Joop Ave was the only politician
of note to put in an appearance,&quot; says one guest from a rival investment
bank. <BR>
<BR>
The absence of the Indonesian glitterati, observers say, may portend significant
changes in the government's attitude to the awarding of privatization mandates.
They point to lingering controversies surrounding the Telkom initial public
offering (IPO) as the cause of the rethink. And they predict that a more
restrained and inward-looking privatization programme will be the order
of the day. <BR>
<BR>
Telkom was, by contrast, a jamboree. The appointment of eight joint global
lead-managers - including Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch
and SG Warburg - combined with a $7 million publicity campaign for the offering
and a 10-month build-up, appeared excessive. It was exacerbated by inflated
forecasts on the part of the underwriters which claimed that parlous domestic
market conditions would not harm their projected $3 billion offering. <BR>
<BR>
In the event, a day before the listing, the government cut the size of the
international tranche by more than half to 30 million American depository
shares and priced these at $18 - below the original indicated range. The
size of the domestic portion was left unchanged at 1.17 billion shares though
these too were priced under their indicated range at Rp2,050. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the end, the government had to intervene to save the day,&quot;
says Eugene Galbraith, president director of HG Asia Securities in Jakarta.
&quot;A lack of cooperation between the global coordinators and an over-complication
in the deal's structure made the underwriters look pretty bad. The government
provided the only people constantly capable of making mature and consistently
professional decisions in the deal.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps ironically, these did not include the team of seven officials originally
appointed to oversee the privatization. Particular casualties among the
team - which was subsequently disbanded - were Martiono Hadianto, the director
general of state-owned enterprises and Yusuf Anwar, the secretary-general
of the finance ministry. Perhaps it was not a coincidence that both also
had ties to global coordinators - local securities firms Bahana and Danareksa
respectively. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There was a growing sense of dismay from president Suharto downwards
that the most important privatization to date was being handled badly,&quot;
says the head of corporate finance at one foreign securities house in Jakarta,
&quot;and that symbolic, if not material, changes had to be made.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Future privatizations will now be overseen by Bacelius Ruru, formerly chairman
of Bapepam (Indonesia's equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission),
under the direct guidance of finance minister Mar'ie Muhammad. Sources close
to Telkom say that Mar'ie took it upon himself to &quot;rescue&quot; the
deal. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tighter control</B> <BR>
<BR>
The new supremos face a tough task. Four state-owned companies are scheduled
for privatization in 1996 in deals that could raise as much as $2 billion.
Analysts predict that Krakatau Steel (which is hoping to raise $500 million),
Bank Negara Indonesia ($200 million), electricity generating company Perusahaan
Listrik Negara ($1 billion) and toll road operator Jasa Marga ($300 million)
will have difficulty coming to the market by the year-end. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is no way that the market could take all of these issues plus
an anticipated second issue for Telkom in the first half,&quot; says James
Spence, head of research at WI Carr in Jakarta. &quot;After two tough years,
the market rose by 100 points between November and January precisely because
there were no rights issues and initial public offerings. The government
would be competing with itself in the market if it tried to achieve its
privatization targets.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There are already indications that Ruru and Mar'ie have imposed a slowdown
in this programme. There have been no beauty contests announced for any
of the IPO mandates while both Jasa Marga and PLN have only recently begun
what are expected to be lengthy internal restructurings and due-diligence
processes. Analysts also say that, in contrast to Indosat and Telkom, there
will be more stress on using the privatizations to develop the domestic
capital markets. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;BNI is most prepared to go to the market but the feeling is that there
will only be a domestic listing,&quot; says the regional financial analyst
at a US investment bank. &quot;This could well be a reaction to Telkom listing
in London, New York and Jakarta and the unfortunate experience with Tambang
Timah.&quot; Timah, the formerly state-owned mining company, saw the share
price of its $160 million IPO listed on the London Stock Exchange fall by
17% in the first five days of trading after its privatization last October.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I suspect that there will be few dual listings of privatized companies
in future,&quot; agrees Galbraith. &quot;Both Mar'ie and Ruru have made
it clear that they want the proceeds of privatizations to benefit the growth
of the domestic market as well as to buy down national debt [which stands
at $100 billion]. And though there is no shortage of accommodating international
financiers in town attempting to persuade them otherwise, they head a faction
which believes that excessive overseas listings will in the end undermine
the future advancement of the local market.&quot; <B>Tony Shale</B> <BR>

<H3><A NAME="hungary"></A>HUNGARY </H3>
<H2>Hungary's huge haul </H2>
In a matter of weeks at the end of last year, the Hungarian state sold as
much property to foreign investors for hard currency as it had sold in the
previous five years. <BR>
<BR>
The $3.3 billion gravy train began rolling last summer when Hungary raised
nearly $300 million from the sale of 33% of national savings bank OTP and
27% of state oil company MOL. In November, another $460 million came from
the sale of stakes of 50% or greater in five regional gas distribution companies,
with one company fetching fully four times the state's minimum bid. In December,
Hungary sold minority stakes in its electrical distribution companies and
some of its power companies for a total of $1.3 billion. And as December
ended, the government sold 37% of national phone company Matav for $850
million to Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech, which had together purchased
30% of the company in 1993. <BR>
<BR>
The year-end privatization frenzy caught almost everyone by surprise. &quot;The
Hungarian government has had plans to sell MOL and the gas and electricity
companies for so long,&quot; says Frances Cloud, an analyst at Nomura Research
Institute in London. &quot;It's been on and off, and on and off for years.
At the beginning of the year when they were saying they would be selling
them, I was thinking 'oh yeah?'.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Privatization officials were floored by the prices foreign investors bid,
particularly for the gas and electrical utilities. The prices were really
beautiful, says Peter Mihaly, chief economist at the APVRt (state privatization
and holding company) which orchestrated the deals. &quot;For the gas companies,
we got 2.5 times what we projected in our internal plans and in the electrical
companies, we got 50% more.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Since these were the first sales in the region of such utilities, Mihaly
hypothesizes that strategic investors - mostly from France, Germany and
Italy - paid premiums in order to &quot;plant their flags&quot; in central
Europe. &quot;We underestimated the impatience of investors and the strategic
importance of our companies,&quot; he says. Hungary's haul was doubly impressive
when compared with the total foreign investment in other countries in the
region. Only the Czech Republic came close to attracting as much foreign
investment - pulling in $3 billion, according to a table in the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development's (EBRD) 1995 transition report
- but that was over a period of five years between 1989 and 1994. The next
largest cash magnets, Poland and Russia, together attracted only $3.1 billion
during the same period. <BR>
<BR>
Hungary's $3.3 billion haul in 1995 is particularly impressive considering
the way the year began. At the end of 1994, the country's top privatization
official, Ferenc Bartha, resigned after Socialist prime minister Gyula Horn
overruled the sale of a chain of 15 hotels called HungarHotels to a US company.
For reneging on the deal, Horn and his Socialist team, who had campaigned
as economic experts when they won elections in May 1994, were caricatured
as ham-fisted statists. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Privatization enthusiast</B> <BR>
<BR>
Horn's reputation with international investors fell further at the end of
February when he appointed a small-town bank branch manager, Tamas Suchman,
as minister in charge of privatization. Suchman, who spoke no foreign languages,
was best known for his friendship with Horn. <BR>
<BR>
Why exactly did Suchman, who many saw as an ally of union leaders and regulatory
bureaucrats, confound expectations and command a privatization blitzkrieg?
Some say he had marching orders from Horn, who had been scared into selling
state assets for hard currency by the near-default of Mexico in 1994 and
a realization that Hungary might be next. Others argue that Suchman hustled
so that he could spend excess sales proceeds on infrastructure projects
designed to boost the Socialist Party's popularity. Speaking for himself,
Suchman says that he realized privatization was the unavoidable route to
a stronger economy and, in the long run, the avoidance of unemployment (see
profile on page 52). <BR>
<BR>
For whatever reason, Suchman is today the toast of the foreign investment
community. The Hungarian state's cupboard is considerably barer than it
was a year ago. Indeed, of the more than 2,000 companies in the government's
portfolio in 1990, only 700 remain and only 400 are of any significant size.
<BR>
<BR>
In 1996, the state will auction electrical companies it did not succeed
in selling in 1995: they have an estimated value of $425 million. Stakes
in chemical companies Borshodchem and TVK might fetch another $100 million.
<BR>
<BR>
Someone might pay $70 million for a 50% stake in Antenna Hungaria, which
holds the concession for broadcasting in Hungary. And ironically HungarHotels
may finally be broken into its constituent parts, yielding at least $50
million. <BR>
<BR>
With most of Hungary's utilities now in foreign hands, one other significant
class of state firm remains to be sold - the banks. The government hopes
to peddle stakes in Hungarian Credit Bank (MHB) and the smaller Trade and
Credit Bank (K&amp;H) some time in 1996. But these sales may not take off,
judging by the government's luck with the late-1995 sale of Budapest Bank.
<BR>
<BR>
Budapest Bank was Lajos Bokros's bank before he became finance minister
last March. As its president, he had taken credit for reforming the institution,
claiming that he had made it fit for purchase by a western partner. Budapest
Bank was Hungary's best bank, Bokros and others believed. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Shock pull-out</B> <BR>
<BR>
So it was a shock when Zurich-based giant Credit Suisse pulled out of negotiations
to buy Budapest Bank shortly after completing due diligence last March.
Swiss executives attributed the withdrawal to strategic incompatibilities,
but Budapest Bank came away from the deal looking like damaged goods. The
bank's next suitor, Dutch bank ING, backed away too, saying that its staff
were preoccupied with managing Barings. <BR>
<BR>
In December, after marathon negotiations, the government finally sold Budapest
Bank to the EBRD and General Electric Capital Corp. Although the investors
spent $87 million for 70% of Budapest Bank, the sale brought the government
nothing. The money simply paid back the $87 million it had injected into
Budapest Bank a year ago to spruce up its balance sheet. <BR>
<BR>
Does all this finagling to sell Hungary's &quot;best&quot; bank bode ill
for MHB and K&amp;H? No, says Katalin Botos, who served as head of the state
banking supervision agency in the early 1990s and is now a finance professor
at Budapest's University of Economics. <BR>
<BR>
Lajos Bokros was a victim of his own public relations, Botos argues. &quot;The
whole government,&quot; she says, &quot;was under big prestige pressure&quot;
to sell Budapest Bank, which probably depressed the price. Things will now
go better she believes, at least for MHB. MHB's president, Zsigmond Jarai,
she says, &quot;is a clever boy. He understands the job and he has time
to wait until he finds the correct partner. He is not under the time pressure
and the prestige pressure.&quot; <B>Henry Copeland<BR>

<H3><A NAME="philippines"></A>PHILIPPINES </H3>
<H2>More optimism than realism </H2>
<BR>
Privatization officials in the Philippines are on a high. After a year of
stutters and stalls, they were able to celebrate the mid-December sale of
7.2 million shares in the 57% state-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB),
raising Ps1.9 billion ($72.4 million). &quot;It was a very successful deal,&quot;
says Crisanta Legaspi, executive officer of the committee on privatization
at the department of finance in Manila. &quot;Nineteen ninety four was our
banner year with the Ps25 billion sale of Petron and the Ps15 billion sale
of National Steel Company (NSC). Now we can look ahead to a pipeline of
big-ticket offerings in 1996.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But market practitioners who followed the PNB deal closely note that such
optimism should be tempered by the fact that Filipino privatizations rarely
go smoothly. PNB only made it to the market, for example, after ING Barings
replaced original lead underwriter Salomon Brothers in the final stages
of the deal and after the size of the deal was cut from 10.5 million shares.
<BR>
<BR>
Poor local market conditions (the Philippines composite index fell by 23%
in the four months preceding the issue), analysts' concern over last-minute
changes to PNB's balance sheet, and a government regulation preventing the
bank from offering its shares at a discount, made the issue a touch-and-go
affair. &quot;Barings won the mandate in the end because it was in favour
of going ahead,&quot; says the president of one foreign securities house
in Manila, &quot;but many felt that the timing was all wrong.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It was a gutsy deal in the end and the pricing was right,&quot; says
Danilo Feliciano, director of corporate finance at Jardine Fleming Exchange
Capital in Manila. &quot;The inclusion of a 2.4 million tranche of warrants
as a way around the discount ban was appreciated by investors.&quot; A 41%
rise in the share price in the improving market since issue supports his
view. <BR>
<BR>
Legaspi's ebullience and the timing of the deal were also linked. The government
needed the proceeds from PNB's sale to guarantee a balanced budget for 1995.
&quot;Revenues generated by privatization have become the key to achieving
a budget surplus,&quot; says Erico Claudio, head of research at James Capel
in Manila. From Ps1 billion or 0.2% of GNP in 1987, privatization proceeds
are scheduled to account for Ps19.5 billion or 0.9% of GNP and 36.8% of
non-tax government collections in 1996. <BR>
<BR>
First off the block, according to Legaspi, could be a further sale of 5%
of NSC (following the 75% offering in 1994), though corporate financiers
in Manila are not holding their breath. First mooted in mid-October, there
is still no sign of NSC listing on the Philippine Stock Exchange. And an
estimated $175 million exchangeable bond for NSC to be led by Peregrine
Capital has been similarly delayed. The deal involves the sale of 20% of
Malaysian steel company Wing Tek's 49% stake in NSC. <BR>
<BR>
The government's greatest hopes are pinned on the privatization of the $11
billion National Power Corporation (Napocor). But though Napocor has attracted
international investor attention in the Euromarkets, principally through
its $150 million yankee bond led by JP Morgan last July and a &#165;11 billion
dragon bond led by Nomura in November, the process of its restructuring
and sale has been slow. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Legal and political wranglings</B> <BR>
<BR>
The award of a lead financial advisory mandate, for example, was initially
scheduled to be made last November. Eight investment banks had combined
to make six bids for the lucrative slot after Napocor had made international
equity market history in the summer by demanding a non-refundable $50,000
from each bidder. But it was only in late January that Merrill Lynch found
that its bid, in association with NM Rothschild, had been successful, beating
Morgan Stanley, Jardine Fleming, SBC Warburg, BZW and Lehman Brothers in
association with Kleinwort Benson. <BR>
<BR>
Morgan Stanley was an unhappy loser - particularly since rival bankers had
seen its staff arrive in Manila to make their presentation to Napocor sporting
T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan, &quot;Napocor Privatization Team Morgan
Stanley&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
And locals were surprised at the winning line-up. &quot;It is strange that
banks with little or no physical presence and commitment in the Philippines
should get the mandate,&quot; says the head of corporate finance at one
Manila-based foreign house. Julian Summer, head of equity corporate finance
at Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, demurs: &quot;We have teamed up with Rothschilds
on quite a few deals since our acquisition of Smith New Court, particularly
on the CVRD mandate in Brazil. It is quite a logical and successful team.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Merrill may have to wait even longer to recoup much of the $50,000. An omnibus
bill which needs to pass through congress is not scheduled until the second
quarter. &quot;The first sale under the programme is expected to be Tiwi
Makban Geothermal corporation,&quot; says the head of international finance
at one local bank, &quot;but any forthcoming issue will need parliamentary
consensus and that will be hard to find.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Political considerations are still dogging the government's proposed sale
of its 51% stake in the Manila Hotel. Although an international consortium
headed by the Renong group of Malaysia and ITT Sheraton made a successful
bid for the stake last September at Ps673 million, the Manila Prince Hotel
group (which bid Ps636 million) has sued to prevent the sale. In doing so,
it has invoked a local law which promises favourable treatment to domestic
companies bidding for privatization deals. <BR>
<BR>
Legaspi says: &quot;There is still a legal impediment and no specific timetable
for the sale of the Manila Hotel.&quot; But she also assures potential foreign
buyers: &quot;The government is very much in favour of foreign investment
in all of its privatization projects.&quot; <B>TS</B> <BR>
<BR>

<H3><A NAME="zambia"></A>ZAMBIA </H3>
<H2>Copper heads the list </H2>
Privatization in Zambia shot ahead last year. More than 100 units were sold,
leaving 200 still in government hands. <BR>
<BR>
During the next few months, attention will focus on the sale of the Zambian
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), an industry that generates 90% of Zambian
exports. The government has put off the sale for several years but is now
determined to finalize a deal as production levels are falling and the mines
require investment for modernization. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Given the situation ZCCM finds itself in at the moment,&quot; says
Jordan Soko, head of merchant banking at Stanbic in Lusaka, &quot;investments
will have to be made in 1996.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Rothschild's study of the mines - to be published this March - is looking
at the two privatization options available: splitting ZCCM into separate
units for sale independently or selling it as one unit. <BR>
<BR>
At the moment, it appears that ZCCM will be split up, partly because of
the proposed investment of Anglo American Corporation. Anglo American holds
a minority stake in the mining group as well as pre-emptive rights and proposes
to invest $600 million into Konkola Deep, a project set up to expand the
Konkola mines. According to George Roberts, director of merchant banking
at Barclays Bank in Lusaka, Anglo American's involvement indicates it is
in favour of splitting up ZCCM. <BR>
<BR>
Although the publication of the report could be only weeks away, Soko at
Stanbic believes a full-blown privatization of ZCCM may not happen this
year. Elections in October may force the government to delay announcing
an official programme. President Chilanga will be under pressure to reassure
the electorate that economic hardships are coming to an end. The outcome
could be that divisions of ZCCM are sold off without an encompassing plan.
<BR>
<BR>
Zamtel, Zambia's telecommunications company, is also in line for privatization.
Most shares in the company will go to a technical partner, but a small percentage
will be sold to the public. Last February a stock exchange opened in Lusaka.
Since then two companies have been floated, generating a mixed response
from the public. Last April, 30% of Chilanga Cement was floated - the company
was privatized in 1994 but 30% of the shares were kept in a privatization
fund - and the issue was fully subscribed. Then, in November, the government
floated the 18% of cigarette manufacturer Rothmans it owned. This issue,
however, was not well received and was only half subscribed. <BR>
<BR>
The timing of the Rothmans issue may have been one of the reasons for its
failure. In the same month, Commerce Bank and Africa Commercial Bank were
forced into receivership because they hadn't met liquidity requirements.
Since then, the situation seems to have stabilized: players in the market
believe other bank failures are unlikely. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Investor education</B> <BR>
<BR>
Among others, Zambia Sugar and Zambia Breweries will be floated in 1996.
Privatization of these two companies was completed last year and now the
government is waiting for the best moment to approach the market. <BR>
<BR>
The next large privatizations will set aside about 30% of companies' shares
to sell to the public. To this end, says Stuart Cruickshank, technical director
of the Zambia Privatization Agency, the government has been making an effort
to educate the public and promote the changes. Radio programmes and television
plays have been broadcast to explain new concepts such as shareholding,
and studies have been carried out to prove that privatization will not mean
redundancies. <BR>
<BR>
The government is likely to start selling off the electricity sector too.
The electricity board has asked the government to develop a new hydroelectric
power station. The project will involve heavy commitment from the private
sector and could prove to be important to Zambia in the future - the country
could well have sufficient capacity to export electricity to Namibia and
South Africa. <BR>
<BR>
Foreign investors are also on the government's list. Many emerging market
funds have been looking critically at Zambia. There is also dissatisfaction
with the local stock market, which lacks liquidity. In all, only nine securities
are traded on the exchange, the most active being Standard Chartered. In
addition, local institutional investors have tended to hold on to their
shares. Confidence in the Zambian economy as a whole should rise, however,
now that the IMF has resumed its loans to the country. <B>Elisa Martinuzzi</B>

<H3><A NAME="south_africa"></A>SOUTH AFRICA </H3>
<H2>Private virtues still in doubt </H2>
South Africa's reconstruction and development programme is on hold. According
to Niko Czytionka, group economist at Standard Bank in Johannesburg, opposition
from the labour unions means that government and industry are already at
loggerheads over the proposed changes. <BR>
<BR>
The pace of the privatization programme - if not its future - now depends
on negotiations between the government and the unions which, driven by fear
of job losses, have been making their feelings known on protest marches.
<BR>
<BR>
Paul Slot, head of privatization at First National Bank in Johannesburg,
is optimistic. &quot;If the political will is strong, privatization will
take place very fast,&quot; he says. An agreement should be reached by the
end of January, but a lack of unanimity within the government is increasing
the friction. Opinions are wide-ranging: some politicians want full-blown
privatization, others are completely against it. Only the cabinet seems
determined to push ahead. <BR>
<BR>
The government first called for tenders in December for advisers to assist
its six task teams. Many domestic banks, the focus for the government's
selection, are expected to compete for the contract, but it will probably
now be February before any advisers are appointed. <BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, the government has been trying to push ahead with other
aspects of privatization. So far, its move towards subcontracting has also
met with resistance. The unions claim the rules are unclear, and it appears
that subcontracting has also muddied the waters for potential asset sales.
<BR>
<BR>
One sale likely to go ahead this year is that of Telkom, South Africa's
telecommunications company. In line with the government's enthusiasm for
strategic partnerships (which facilitate the imposition of standards such
as employment conditions on companies), Telkom will sell between 20% and
30% to a strategic partner. This January it received several submissions
from potential buyers including prominent foreign telecom companies. Deutsche
Telekom, Stet, AT&amp;T and BT are thought to have submitted offers. Goldman
Sachs, the adviser for the transaction, will draw up a list of four or five
potential partners by January 25. If the regulatory and competitive environments
are built up, Telkom's plans for the deal to be completed by the second
quarter may materialize. <BR>
<BR>
Various small companies are also likely to be sold in the coming months.
These will be enterprises that the government believes do not need to be
under public policy. For the first half of 1996, the list includes Sun Air,
Transkei Air and Autonet. The advantages of selling these assets are twofold:
they should meet little resistance from the unions and they should prove
the merits of privatization. <BR>
<BR>
Another two or three such companies will follow before the end of the year,
but the big sales will only come in 1997. According to Slot at First National
Bank, the stock exchange is booming, but it is unlikely that there will
be public offers of the assets. Any offers in the coming months will be
to the labour unions. <B>EM</B> <BR>
<BR>

<H3><A NAME="greece"></A>GREECE </H3>
<H2>Better times ahead </H2>
In contrast to 1995, 1996 looks certain to be a better year for privatization
in Greece. First, there has been a drive to privatize non-strategic state
enterprises which are bleeding red ink. Second, some strategic state enterprises
have been given the go-ahead to offer up to 49% of their shares to the public.
This will give private investors increased control, and even management,
without the state losing the companies completely, and the companies access
to the know-how and capital required to compete in international markets.
The State Telecommunications Company (OTE) and the State Petroleum Company
(DEP) fall into this category. <BR>
<BR>
With a float of between 8% and 9%, the part-privatization of OTE is likely
to take place by the second quarter of 1996. It is intended that the small
initial public offering will result in oversubscription in the local market
- shares will be sold only locally - and the price, once stabilized, will
form a starting point for future listings on overseas bourses. <BR>
<BR>
The government has also earmarked some state-controlled banks for sale.
It is likely that the small Bank of Attica will be partly privatized via
a capital increase, after which 50% of its shares will be sold to a public
fund and a private-sector retirement fund. At the moment, the bank's major
shareholder is the state-controlled Commercial Bank of Greece. <BR>
<BR>
The dilution of the state-controlled Army Fund's stake in the General Bank
of Greece, from 68.5% to 51%, has almost been completed. The balance will
probably go to another Greek private banking group, or even foreign strategic
investors. <BR>
<BR>
Another state bank ready to be privatized is the scandal-ridden Bank of
Crete, which has been cleansed of its sins - and its huge debts - by an
act of parliament. <BR>
<BR>
The country's largest bank, the National Bank of Greece, has issued bonds
convertible to common shares, with the first coupon expiring in 1996 at
Dr15,000 per share and the second coupon expiring in 1998 at Dr7,500 per
share. The economics ministry, which has the bonds in its possession, is
planning to exercise its rights and will probably sell the shares to foreign
investors. <BR>
<BR>
Other privatizations close to completion include Macedonian Textiles, textile-dye
company Ilionfin, cement firm Tsimenta Chalkidos, winery Kampas and Cassandra
Gold Mines - all of which are now in the hands of the National Bank of Greece.
The other state banks are also planning to privatize most of their non-banking
subsidiaries. <BR>
<BR>
Companies that have to overcome big hurdles before they can be privatized
successfully include the one-time premier textile company Piraiki-Patraiki,
metal industry Larko, hygiene industry Kerafina, paper mill Softex and Elevsis
Shipyards. All these cases are hard to crack and will test the Greek government's
resolve to proceed with the much-needed privatization drive. <B>Stefanos

<H3> <B>AGAINST THE TIDE&#009;</B> </H3> <H3> <B>Kohl's secret success could be
EMU's undoing </B> </H3> <P> <B>by David Roche</B>

<P> If you were to believe the consensus view about Germany, the economy is on
its knees, public finances are in such bad shape that Germany will not meet the
terms for EMU entry in 1999, and German industry is locked in the sclerosis of
high labour costs and declining world market share.

<P> Nothing could be further from the truth. Germany will get its fiscal house in
order in 1997. And German reforms at the levels of the household (shop opening
hours), corporate (embracing shareholder value) and government (fiscal
consolidation) are increasingly entrenched. Grass-roots reform of German
corporate culture will restore its health.

<P> The irony is that none of these things are happening in France. France won't
make Maastricht, the economy is not reviving and corporate and labour market
reforms are missing. This means that a quality gap between the two economies is
opening up, which could scupper European integration and monetary union &#173;
exactly the opposite of the intention of Kohl's reforms.

<P> If you want to know why Germany's different, visit Bonn: it is the most
understated political capital for one of the world's most powerful nations. The
parliament is a low-lying building, aptly called the "goldfish bowl". It looks
like something at a newish UK university. German political tourists (they can't
possibly be visiting anything or anybody else except their MP) throng leafy lanes
in groups.

<P> Inside the parliament, a collegiate air reigns. The senior members of both
parties resemble academics, in sports coats, open shirts, leather ties and white
socks. They busily cooperate in committees across party lines, like members of
rival faculties rather than competing political parties riven by conflicting
ideological convictions.

<P> Yet it's here that Kohl is quietly achieving the measures necessary to ensure
that Germany at least is ready for monetary union. German politicians of all
parties are hell-bent on balancing the budget and stopping the vertiginous rise
in public debt. The desire to preserve <I>Standort Deutschland</I> (Germany as a
production platform) is much stronger than making political capital out of
opposing budget-cutting measures.

<P> This cross-party consensus means that Kohl's package will be passed by the
end of the year. Most of the measures Kohl wants to implement can be delayed by
the SPD majority in the Bundesrat (the upper house), but not stopped. Kohl will
get his Dm70 billion ($47 billion) of savings through. That's 2% of GDP, which
means Germany will meet Maastricht's target of 3% of GDP deficit in 1997.

<P> Kohl's package consists of three parts: federal savings of Dm25 billion
($16.9 billion), l&auml;nder and municipal savings of Dm25 billion, and social
security savings of Dm20 billion. All Dm20 billion of measures on social policy
have been approved by the Bundestag (the lower house). Also, all federal measures
and many of the l&auml;nder ones have already been passed. Of the original Dm50
billion of measures, Kohl has compromised on around Dm4 billion, because of the
1.3% civil service wage increase, and Dm0.8 billion, because he was unable to
raise women's retirement age. And he's still got to get approval for about Dm10
billion in savings from the l&auml;nder, and Dm3 billion on the l&auml;nder
rebate of the solidarity surcharge. But that still leaves Dm32.2 billion of the
original Dm50 billion measures, and they can't be overturned by the Bundesrat.

<P> Between now and the middle of September, the legislation goes to the
Bundesrat (where it will be rejected), and to the opposition SPD-dominated
joint conciliation committee, which will make new proposals for compromise. But
Kohl need not worry. He can reject these JCC proposals. All that happens is that
the Bundesrat then rejects the package itself (non-binding) and the reforms are
sent back to the Bundestag.

<P> On September 13 the Bundestag then votes again. Kohl needs a
50%-plus-one-seat majority in this vote, which he's almost certain to get
(there's only a 5% chance that left-leaning CDU members will vote against). At
that stage, Dm52.2 billion of measures become law, ready for implementation on
January 1 1997. So Germany will have 1.5% of GDP in deficit-cutting measures
guaranteed before the likes of France, Italy or Spain can even start discussing
their 1996 revenue shortfalls.

<P> In the autumn the German parliament goes on to discuss the annual tax law.
This does require Bundesrat approval and will certainly be adapted and/or watered
down. But, of the Dm10 billion l&auml;nder savings on hold from September 13,
between Dm5 billion and Dm8 billion is still likely to be agreed. A compromise
may also be reached on the Dm3 billion l&auml;nder rebate of the solidarity
surcharge. But, most amazingly, l&auml;nder presidents (mostly SPD) have come up
with <I>additional</I> measures over and above Kohl's proposals. As I learned on
my recent visit to Bonn, they're as set on deficit-reduction as Kohl is. This
could save between Dm10 billion and Dm15 billion. So the worst-case scenario is
savings of between Dm15 billion and Dm20 billion from the annual tax law
discussions.

<P> <B>The great tax reform project</B>

<P> Tax reform is as critical as Kohl's goal of shrinking the size of the state
from 50% to 46% by 2000. German taxes are high, demotivating and complex. The top
rate of marginal income tax in Germany is 53%, compared with the US's 46.2% and
the UK's 40%. Germany's effective corporate tax burden is 62.3% of pre-tax
profits in the west and 57.0% in the east. That compares with 45.3% in the US,
45% in France and 33% in the UK.

<P> Add uncompetitive (west) German unit labour costs, 20% above Japan and Italy,
and 12% above France, it is not hard to see why there's a panic on about
<I>Standort Deutschland. </I>Net profit margins for German industry are now 0.3%
of sales, compared with 4.8% for UK companies.

<P> The government's tax reform project will simplify German direct taxes and
reduce them &#173; both absolutely and as a percentage of GDP. Out will go the
current individual rates for private income, independents and professionals; the
twin corporate tax rates (one for reinvested profits and one for paid-out
profits); plus a labyrinth of exemptions and loopholes. Under the new system
there will be three rates for everyone, including corporations. Achieving all
this means a big shift in the tax burden from direct to indirect taxes, plus a
big reduction in tax breaks.

<P> While there seems to be a lot of high seriousness in Bonn about doing what
Germany is good at &#173; disciplining matters, financial and industrial &#173;
there's a lot less urgency about freeing the markets to do the job of curing<I>
</I>corporate Germany of its ills. True, the Kohl package frees companies with
less than 10 employees, rather than five as previously, from Germany's highly
restrictive labour laws. And these companies represent 80% of all companies and
account for two-thirds of employment. But when it comes to specific measures to
free up markets, the last 20 years of supply-side economics have driven right
past Bonn on the historical autobahn.

<P> But does it matter? Maybe, as in Japan, the market will do the job of
liberalising for the politicians. After all, even in small towns in Germany you
can now buy bread from bakeries on Sundays. By German standards, that's a
revolutionary move. Nobody pretends that German corporations are about to trade
their culture for the personality of their peers across the Atlantic. Nor will
they run <BR> themselves purely for profits and shareholders. But a little change
at the margin can work wonders for investors, because that's what they buy.

<P> Culture is a part of the equation &#173; and the enemy of ultimate truth in
economics. If the supply-side gospel was the one true path to economic riches,
Switzerland would be poor and Korea an economic failure. Maybe Germany will
produce half a supply-side success. But that would be much better than today's
perception of Germany as an abject economic failure.

<P> In this column, I've argued that corporate globalisation and domestic
deindustrialisation were the inevitable destiny of two countries: Japan and
Germany. The process is well begun. Look at Germany's growing outflows of foreign
direct investment. They will accelerate as Germany GmbH moves abroad in its quest
to make more profitably what it designs at home. This is good news for German
corporate profitability, even if it is bad news for German labour.

<P> Corporate globalisation draws a line between what's good for Germany GmbH and
for Germany the country. The government will continue to try to keep its
expenditure falling as a proportion of a slow-growing GDP, and it will probably
succeed. Should deficits continue to rise, there's oodles of political will in
Bonn to make more deficit-cutting packages after the current one. And market
liberalisation will be foisted upon government from below, where it's cooking in
the kitchen of German corporate restructuring.

<P> There remains a lot of corporate restructuring to do. Germany's unemployment
problem stems not from massive corporate downsizing but from new post-unification
entrants coming into the labour force. Corporate Germany employs as many people
today as when the Berlin Wall fell. That fat is about to hit the fire.

<P> <B>The corporate reformers</B>

<P> German companies are slowly changing, driven by the need to stay competitive.
There are already some German companies that stand out like islands for the
salvation of shareholders &#173; Veba, with its move to US accounting and
shareholder principles of management (like US return objectives); Hoechst,
separating its divisions to generate shareholder wealth; and Metro, which happens
to be the biggest retailer in Europe, merging its activities to create a more
transparent company.

<P> In the financial sector, Deutsche<I> </I>Bank has introduced a funded pension
fund and Dresdner Bank has offered its management share options. Elsewhere, the
CFOs of Bayer and BASF are heading a new commission which aims to push through
legislation which would allow German companies to buy back up to 10% of their
shares. If all goes to plan, this legislation will be in force by early 1997. The
list of reformers may, so far, be short. And it doesn't imply uniform change
across corporate Germany, let alone each sector. But it's a start.

<P> After reform in the government sector and structural change in the private
sector, the third factor in favour of German financial assets is the economic
cycle. If the SPD has one major fear, as big as the fear of being seen to be
fiscally irresponsible, it is that Kohl's budget package is too deflationary for
the economy to bear. However, when the state frees up some Deutschmarks by
spending less, those Deutschmarks get spent more efficiently than before. That's
pro, not anti, growth.

<P> And the German economy is about to grow. It will be a classic German
recovery, driven by exports and investment rather than by consumption. The
domestic consumer market is bottoming out, rather than diving. Auto sales, which
presaged Japan's recovery when the consensus was for collapse, are going at a
nice clip. Broad money to GDP is on the rise. And money hasn't been so cheap for
eight years. The IFO industrial confidence indicator has picked up. Once the
current spate of inventory overhang has passed by, GDP will bounce back to match
growth in final demand.

<P> It is unlikely that other EU countries, particularly France, can emulate what
Germany is doing. The result is that, by autumn, France and Germany will start to
move apart again in terms of market perception. That will make EMU harder, not
easier, to achieve.

<P> So I'm sticking to my view, expressed in this column before, that there's a
60% probability that EMU won't happen on time, and an 80% probability that it
will fail within two years if it does. EMU volatility will increase as the date
approaches, the perception of Germany improves and that of France worsens.

<H2>Slipping through the net</H2>
<H4>
Netting makes bankers' eyes glaze over. But close-out netting can make them
money. By Christopher Stoakes </H4>
If bank A and bank B enter into a criss-cross of foreign exchange or derivatives
transactions, it makes sense for them to agree to tot up what each owes
the other and for the balance - the net amount, rather than the gross -
to be paid over by one to the other. This is payment netting. It reduces
the delivery exposure to each party by substituting net for gross amounts.
It cuts transaction costs by reducing payment flows and cross-currency conversions.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>B</B>ut the reason why bankers are keen on netting is because a variation,
called close-out netting, has recently been recognized as effective for
capital adequacy requirements and US accounting rules. This means that bankers
can report their risk net rather than gross, thereby reducing the capital
attributable to each transaction. The bank's cost of capital is reduced
and it can take on more business. <BR>
<BR>
The only decision then is what form of master agreement to enter into with
counterparties. One is the International Foreign Exchange Master Agreement
(Ifema) which is sponsored by the British Bankers' Association (BBA). The
other is the Isda (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) model.
Ifema is generally regarded as the simpler and therefore better document,
but it covers only foreign exchange (FX) transactions. The Isda agreement,
by contrast, has the benefit of being a multi-product document, which is
why it is more complicated. But it just requires an FX addendum to do what
the Ifema document does. Your choice depends on whether your counterparties
deal in swaps and derivatives, or simply trade in FX. If they just do FX,
they are better off sticking to the Ifema agreement. <BR>
<BR>
Netting can be tricky and tedious because it embraces two subjects dear
to lawyers' hearts - insolvency and conflict of laws. Insolvency because
the attempt by banks A and B to net their positions will really be tested
if one of them goes bust; and conflict of laws because the chances are that
A and B are international banks in different countries, so their attempts
to net successfully will depend on the insolvency laws of the defaulting
party. <BR>
<BR>
The courts of some countries - principally those with a civil law system
such as Spain's - are hostile to the idea that netting should deplete the
pool of assets available to the rest of a bust bank's creditors, and their
courts could ignore the netting agreement completely. A may be obliged to
continue making payments without any prospect of bankrupt B doing the same.
If that happens while A is blithely assuming - and reporting to the regulators
- that its positions with B are being met, A could collapse too. A and B
may specify that their agreement is to be governed by the law of a sympathetic
jurisdiction. Whether that choice is upheld will itself vary from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction. &quot;Once one descends to that level of detail,&quot;
says a netting specialist in the legal department of a US bank, &quot;the
possibility for voluminous analysis is endless.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For this reason, bodies such as the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision
have recommended that netting should be recognized only if it is backed
by legal opinions showing that the netting agreement is effective in all
relevant jurisdictions. In a sense, all jurisdictions are likely to be relevant
in the context of international banking, which is why Isda and BBA have
been collecting legal opinions from around the world. <BR>
<BR>
To make the task manageable, the regulators have specified that the relevant
jurisdictions in bank A's case means the laws of the country where B's head
office is located, and the country where, if A is dealing with a branch
of B, that branch is located. Also relevant are the laws governing the individual
transactions to be netted and the netting agreement itself. This can still
be complicated where A and B want to enter into a multi-branch master agreement.
&quot;You need compatibility of treatment between jurisdictions,&quot; says
David McCarthy, an international finance partner at Cameron Markby Hewitt.
&quot;Even in Italy, for example, opinions conflict over whether the courts
will accept close-out netting.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Clifford Chance has carried out a comparison of the effect of insolvency
law on netting in 10 key jurisdictions. The results are not uniform. Key
questions include whether B's liquidator can cherry-pick (choose which agreements
to keep and which to treat as terminated), whether a clause providing for
automatic termination is necessarily desirable, and whether retrospective
termination (as provided for in the Isda agreement) works. One type of provision,
called a walkaway clause, would seem ideal. It says that, if B defaults,
A can still require payment of its loss while not being bound to pay over
any gain on termination. However, the regulators do not like such clauses
and, if they see one in a contract or master agreement, will withhold the
regulatory benefits of netting. <BR>
<BR>
All of this assumes, of course, that A and B are close-out netting. By contrast,
payment (or settlement) netting does not change the underlying gross obligations
and cannot be used cross-currency. For these reasons, it is inadequate to
obtain regulatory recognition. It simply means that, on the due date, amounts
in the same currency can be netted off and only the balance changes hands.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>T</B>he third version, netting by novation, does alter the underlying
gross obligations. Novation occurs when a new contract, which replaces an
old one, comes into being. As A and B enter into successive transactions,
the gross obligations are replaced by the net position. This is treated
as effective by regulators but, like payment netting, it only affects payments
in the same currency due on the same date. &quot;Netting by novation is
a misnomer. It is really payment netting in advance,&quot; says derivatives
partner Schuyler Henderson at Baker &amp; McKenzie. &quot;You don't wait
until the payment date to net but do so each time you enter into a contract
which creates a fixed monetary obligation on the given date where this is
reverse obligation in the same currency.&quot; By contrast, close-out netting
cuts across all currencies and concertinas all deals. &quot;It is a valuation
of future cash flows, not of liabilities currently payable,&quot; says Henderson.
<BR>
<BR>
The disaster for any bank is to find its version of netting is the wrong
one or does not work. &quot;You've geared up your trading to exploit net
positions and then you find they're not netted after all,&quot; chuckles
the specialist at the US bank. <p>

the set of Baywatch. Ever since they filmed part of <I>The Firm</I> here,
the place has been overrun with garishly clad tourists. What a pity. But
fortunately, the islands are the most expensive in the Caribbean, which
keeps away the worst of the Coney Island brigade. <BR>
<BR>
The House of Black Knight has closed its books for 1995. The staff bonuses
are safely in the bank. The staff seem pleased: there have been no mass
desertions to the waiting arms of Edson Mitchell and &quot;Dobbo&quot; at
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, John McNiven at Merrill or Ian Abrams and his
colleagues at ABN Amro, who were furiously waving the big cheque book around.
Black Knight didn't manage to beat 1993 but profits came to within 10% of
that vintage year. Did our personal bonus cheque have sufficient zeros to
buy that 16,000-acre sporting estate with the modest 85-room Schloss on
the Kyle of Lochalsh? No, but our assets now include four bed-and-breakfast
money-spinners in Oban. The Kyle will have to wait until next year. <BR>
<BR>
<B>W</B>ill the leading lights of the Euromarkets and international banking
receive the Christmas presents of their choice? This year, they will have
been able to indulge their every whim. However, I received an unsigned,
unmarked fax from Zurich which listed some famous market names and suggested
a present, which they may not have wanted but which they probably deserved.
Some of these stocking fillers caught our imagination... <BR>
<BR>
To John McNiven at Merrill Lynch, a course of six lessons to overcome his
shyness; to Edson Mitchell at Deutsche/ MG, John McNiven's car number plate;
to Michael Dobson at Deutsche/MG, Merrill Lynch and/or SG Warburg; to Guy
Dawson at Merrill Lynch, Dobbo's chair; to Martin Owen at Natwest Markets,
a miracle; to David Scholey at SBC Warburg, a 1993 time-warp; to Marc Ospel
at SBC Warburg, just one outfit with matching jacket and trousers; to George
Magan at Hambro Magan, a large Asprey's hair gel container; to Rupert Hambro
at JO Hambro, Hugh Grant's address book; to Nick &quot;The Horse&quot; Jones
at Lazard, one winner in 1996; to Dan Tyree at Lehman, a bid of $50 per
share; to Charlie McVeigh at Salomon, a partnership at Goldman; to Tom Cross
Brown at Lazard Investors, Baring Asset Management; to David Robbins at
UBS, a desk for Len Harwood; to John Langton at Isma, not more than six
sunken yachts in Cannes; to Jack Hennessey at cS First Boston, just a small
part in &quot;Goldeneye&quot;; to Michael Dee at Morgan Stanley, a &quot;K&quot;
in recognition of his charity work; to Mike Sherwood at Goldman Sachs, a
job switch to equities; to David Band at BZW, HSBC Markets on a plate. <BR>
<BR>
<B>W</B>ho were the winners and losers in the great 1995 financial steeplechase?
Certainly, there were no bigger losers than Barings and SG Warburg who fell
at the water jump and never resurfaced. Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
Strauss Turnbull, once such a marvellous mover, broke a leg at the first
and was taken away by the French Red Cross. Cresvale tumbled at the first
open ditch and had to be destroyed. Bankers Trust lost all its jockeys,
including Brian Walsh and ran riderless in the wrong direction for most
of the year. MC Securities, the most heavily backed outsider at 100-1, has
confused both punters and bookmakers. &quot;We think that MC is still running
out on the course but they haven't been sighted for some time,&quot; reported
our man on the rails. &quot;Has Hans-Joerg forgotten how to use the whip?&quot;
gushed a star-struck lovely in the members' enclosure. &quot;Don't you believe
it sister,&quot; replied matinee idol Joan Beck, cracking his wallet. <BR>
<BR>
While racegoers were reliably told that Bear Stearns in Europe came under
starters' orders, &quot;The Bear&quot;, a 200-1 shot, has disappeared completely.
Could The Bear have been nobbled or even kidnapped? &quot;There is a rumour
that the animal may have been entered in a dog-race,&quot; commented a local
policeman. Also running after the same hare in the dog steeplechase was
Hambros Bank which hit every hurdle and was eventually found abandoned in
an unsellable downmarket housing estate near Ongar. <BR>
<BR>
But what about the race leaders? Just look at Merrill Lynch, once the ugliest
contender in the parade ring and now moving effortlessly in the lead with
$1 billion of prize money already won this year. Another leader not noted
for either good looks or pedigree breeding is Goldman Sachs which ran a
disastrous race in 1994. A well-known tipster on the course says that Goldman
should fire all of its bond jockeys. There are new jockeys aplenty at Deutsche
Morgan Grenfell where Hilmar Kopper has been &quot;promoted&quot; by the
new British and US trainers to the role of time-keeper and hoof-cleaner.
DMG's Edson Mitchell became the highest paid Euromarket bond jockey in 1995
replacing Salomon's retiring top rider Stevie Posford, who earned an astounding
$20 million in 1994 but came in last in every race this year. &quot;It was
a classic case of flogging a very dead horse,&quot; commented legendary
filly-fancier Christopher Heath of Caspian who has backed himself at 3,000-1
for the 1996 Canoodle Stakes at Cheltenham house parties. <BR>
<BR>
Delighting the race crowds throughout the year have been CS First Boston
and SBC, despite carrying 800 million pounds extra weight with SG Warburg.
The former Warburg jockey Davey Scholey failed to weigh in. Against all
the odds, at the beginning of the race, the main Japanese entrants were
only a nosebag behind the winners and briefly showed in front at the three-quarter
stage. New jockeys account for the sudden return to form. Nikko's all-round
sportsman and swashbuckler, Michel de Carvalho, rides faster than Dick Turpin
on the way to York. At Daiwa, the dashing Philip Porter has taken to wearing
spurs much to the delight of his many lady admirers. At Nomura, formerly
carrying several million pounds of dead wood, the high-flying jockey Simon
Fry sensibly sug-gested that 90% of the older stable boys should be put
out to grass. Morgan Stanley, despite some questions about its current breeding,
thrilled the crowds by making a late run on the inside. &quot;They always
come from behind and when you least expect,&quot; said our local racing
correspondent. <BR>
<BR>
What is the form for 1996? A mountain of money is reportedly going on Merrill
Lynch. Why are the bookmakers making odds on Deutsche Morgan Grenfell falling
at the Canal Turn on the second circuit? Is ABN Amro the dark horse of 1996?
Will Salomon run the 1996 races with four legs instead of three? The excitement
is almost too much to bear.<p>

<H3><B>DIARY OF AN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT BANKER </B></H3>

<H4>
<B>Medicine for the old folks in IowaKomarovsky sees Ingersoll shed a tear and dig deep out of loyalty to the bottom line</B>
</H4>
<H3>
JJ Ingersoll, our head of global focus, is raging at Stella de Santos's latest coup. Our newly hired head of regional and emerging focuses has just launched a record-breaking 1,000-year floater for debut borrower El Republico de Basket Caso.
</H3>
<P>
A novel marketing structure was used. The republic felt a costly roadshow process would be counter to its and investors' interests given its lack of a credit rating or a central statistics office. So we elected to send every fund manager in Edinburgh a case of single-malt whisky with a prospectus inside. Reports coming back from our salesforce were that the woody-tasting Isle of Gaga went down very well, and that the orders were large. Macpherson at the Braveheart Pension Trust said the pricing started to look exciting on the rocks and bubbly with soda. 

<P>
In the face of his rival's success, JJ fears he's lost his touch. The yo-yo on the 85th floor has already sent Stella a soon-to-be-published memo promising her a contraband supply of elastic bands if she keeps up this level of productivity and continues to answer her phone after two rings, all of which is good for the bottom line.

<P>
So as I walk in I am not surprised to see JJ in a reflective mood, rummaging through his drawers in his annual tribute to Guy Fawkes, a bin-fire. Next to the trading tickets, which effortlessly float into the licking abyss, there is a speech he wrote 25 years ago. With a glint in his eye he reminisces on how much simpler life was then. Just a matter of putting your cufflinks on in the morning and helping to finance Italian motorways. Happy days. He flaps the dog-eared speech at me.

<P>
I pick up the speech which is entitled <I>Can we ever go global again?</I> "Gentleman," it begins. "We stand at the cusp of a brave new world. Was it the poet James Morrison who said let us break on through to the other side before dying naked of a heroin overdose in a bath in Paris? I think it was, and I think, as he lit our fire, he related a central truth."

<P>
JJ has tears in his eyes and looks skywards as if expecting some reward from beyond for his years of service to the firm, when suddenly the phone rings. It's an editorial assistant from the hottest new TV business show in town, NFC Squat-Box with Ralph Diddly. Can JJ appear and talk about stuff for five minutes? Whatever stuff he wants including his Basket Caso whatever it was. It's got the street talking and the ticker-tape ticking. JJ looks in his diary and says when do they want him. In five minutes. 

<P>
I turn on the TV and there's the ever-slick Ralph Diddly, doyen of the cross-border question and star-spangled friend of the yo-yo on the 85th floor. The questions are rattled off between interruptions from Diddly's sidekick, Joe Larue, about punchy stocks vibrating along his ticker. "So JJ, what do you think of stuff happening in the Middle East and how's that gonna impact the Dow? What's your view on technology stocks &#173; in Kiev? What do you think of that Repsol out of Spain?" The questions go on until finally Diddly asks: "Great deal you did with Basket Caso, what's that mean for ma and pa in Iowa?" 

<P>
This is JJ's moment, and I look across the trading floor and see Stella barely able to control her emotions. "Well, Ralph, this is the type of deal where everyone's basically a winner. In this business we like to call them rare beasts."

<P>
"Could you define a rare beast. Just for the folks at home."

<P>
"Sure. It's basically an animal that's not very common."

<P>
"Got ya. So you might see one in a zoo. Right? But only a very good zoo I'm sure."

<P>
"Sure Ralph. But you'd see the Basket Caso deal in a financial zoo, and if I had my way Ralph it would be just off Wall Street and Jean Paul Volcker would be the zoo-keeper and Charlie Sanford would clean up the mess the deals make."

<P>
"I bet the kids would love that zoo. But getting back to the deal. Everyone's a winner. So that means there are little or no losers in this transaction. Is that a correct interpretation of what you said?"

<P>
"Love that interpretation, Ralph."

<P>
"Thanks. But strictly speaking, is that possible? I mean, is that not like an American, a Russky and a Chinese all winning gold in the 100-metre medley swimming event &#173; always a personal favourite of mine."

<P>
"But the bond markets are a different kind of swimming pool, Ralph. That's what the kids at home have to understand. What we did here was to basically take a borrower that had never borrowed before. The fact that it could even borrow at all was a miracle. So it was a definite winner. We priced it generously for investors and gave them an option to put the bond after 500 years. So they're a winner too. And we as lead managers earned a few pennies &#173; as did everyone in the syndicate, all of whom were entirely satisfied with how few bonds they got."

<P>
"A put after 500 years? Could you explain what that means."

<P>
"Yes, Ralph, that basically offers the investor a lot of flexibility with what is basically an unknown credit. It's basically a get-out option for  more risk-averse investors, such as pension funds. I suspect, however, that S&amp;M will give the republic a rating pretty soon, and I hope several upgrades on top."

<P>
"Ratings. Basically they mean how likely the borrower is to pay the money back?"

<P>
"Sure Ralph. But the great thing about this deal is that investors have a chance to move all the way along the yield curve, accumulating a strong coupon flow alongside the possibility of a price boost should the republic ever manage to get a rating or we agree to trade the paper. And some pretty exciting things could happen if the existing government gets toppled in the forthcoming elections."

<P>
"Out of interest, where is the Basket Caso and what is its capital city?"

<P>
"It's located just beyond the Pampers plains, behind a group of large palm trees, and is encircled by the Locos river. Its seat of power and capital is called La Bamba."

<P>
"When are the elections?"

<P>
"Hard to tell. But if they're not overly soon the locals don't mind."

<P>
"Why's that?"

<P>
"I'm told they're very happy drinking their Molotov cocktails in the evenings."

<P>
"What does all this mean for the US?"

<P>
"It's good news because the government is dedicated to cultivating pharmaceutical products, and we all want to live in a healthier world."

<P>
"So ma and pa in Iowa may not die after all."

<P>
"That's why this bond is such a rare beast."

<P>
Diddly turns to face the camera. "JJ Ingersoll, thanks. On Squat-box next week we're gonna go looking for that zoo JJ mentioned earlier. Until then my advice to you is: close out those positions and do your financial homework."

<P>
I look across the trading floor. The yo-yo is beaming.

<H2><A NAME="tough-decisions"></A>Time for tough decisions </H2>
<H4>The long-term outlook for Greece's economy is promising. But investors
say the government needs to drastically rethink ways to increase productivity,
develop the bond and stock markets, and boost privatization. By Katharine
Morton 
</H4>
Even though Athens is a frustrating place to be at the moment much has been
achieved in the past three years: the government has brought inflation down
to single digits for the first time in over 20 years, checked the public
deficit, opened new trading areas in the Balkans and deregulated the capital
markets. <BR>
<BR>
In the short term, though, things look bad. <BR>
<BR>
Investors are concerned that a different mentality is needed for Greece
to achieve convergence. &quot;By the end of 1996 we will have covered two-thirds
of the distance toward fulfilling the Maastricht criteria,&quot; says Stefanos
Avgouleas, special adviser at the national economy ministry. &quot;But we
are reaching the hard core of inflation and the budget deficit.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
When inflation reached 9.2% in the year to April it became clear that Greece
would not meet its own 5% convergence goal this year - anything under
7.5% will be a bonus. <BR>
<BR>
With the governing Pasok socialist party in turmoil ahead of its party congress
in late June - which will determine the fate of prime minister Kostas
Simitis - things are unlikely to get easier. But Simitis is respected
in the market as the former national economy minister who undertook a stabilization
programme in the 1980s. &quot;If Simitis doesn't hang on, we're in trouble,&quot;
says Victor Pisante, an executive at Telesis Capital. &quot;But he's a smart
man with a couple of aces up his sleeve. He'll find a way to assert himself.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Responsibility for pursuing the convergence policy has been falling mainly
on the central bank. The so-called hard drachma link with the Ecu has become
a cornerstone of monetary policy. The Bank of Greece has executed its task
effectively, hitting inflation targets for the past two years. <BR>
<BR>
The central bank has allowed the drachma to appreciate against the Ecu:
it climbed by 4.5% in the year to May. Already the current account deficit
has deteriorated sharply from a $100 million shortfall in 1994 to $3.3 billion
in 1995. Without EU transfers, which amount to over 5% of GDP, the current
account deficit would be significantly worse. <BR>
<BR>
Lucas Papademos, governor of National Bank of Greece, the largest financial
institution in the country, admits the drachma has been between 2% and 3%
overvalued since 1993. &quot;In some ways the foreign exchange policy is
over-credible now, creating foreign capital inflows,&quot; says deputy governor
Nicholas Karamouzis. <BR>
<BR>
But players are realizing that the government cannot rely on monetary policy
alone to take Greece into the next stage: something is going to have to
change for convergence to continue. Says George Papoutsis, treasurer of
National Mortgage Bank of Greece: &quot;Productivity cannot increase by
much more and the service sector capacity has been reached. It's not a stable
environment any more. It seems that we are stuck. We're reaching the point
where we have to have a solution.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Greek economy is still driven by the public sector. Avgouleas at the
national economy ministry is confident that structural measures alone will
sufficiently reduce the public sector deficit. Structural measures have
already helped reduce the budget deficit to 9.2% of GDP in 1995 from 14.2%
in 1994. In order to achieve its 7.4% budget deficit target for this year,
the government plans to restructure the banking sector, reduce spending
and rationalize public entities' spending. But next year's target of a primary
budget surplus is ambitious, especially in an election year. <BR>
<BR>
The ministry of finance, acting through the central bank, is attempting
to reduce external debt (set to be $4.5 billion in gross terms this year)
by refinancing in the domestic markets and abandoning drachma-linked foreign
exchange bond issues. It also wants to reduce the proportion of borrowing
in non-EU currencies. &quot;I hope we stick to this project,&quot; says
Spyros Papanicolaou, director of international banking at the Bank of Greece.
&quot;If we pass the test of the next elections then borrowing will become
easier.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Disengaging from the process of convergence is no longer an effective alternative.
Both political parties are aware of this. Once the economy begins to open
up to private investment, the prospects for growth will be immense. <bR><BR><BR>
<H2><A NAME="long-arm"></A>The long arm of government </H2>
<H4>After three years rehearsing, the privatization of Greece's state telecom
OTE marked a new era for the Athens Stock Exchange. But the exchange has
yet to win its own independence from the Greek government 
</H4>
Privatization in Greece has progressed slowly - but not without success.
The largest IPO ever on the stock exchange came in March, with the privatization
of 8% of the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization (OTE) through a private
placement and a simultaneous offering of shares to Greek and international
investors. The transaction size was around $385 million. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Privatization progress is something we should be proud of,&quot; says
Stefanos Avgouleas, special adviser at the national economy ministry. &quot;With
OTE, the first step has been made.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For OTE it was third time lucky. The two previous attempts to sell the telecoms
utility had failed. Schroder and CS First Boston were initially mandated
to privatize the utility three years earlier. But in February all that changed.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They dropped the ball in February,&quot; says one Athens-based broker.
&quot;They had no appetite for the deal. They didn't attribute value to
OTE. They just weren't prepared to underwrite it. The value they gave it
was 10% less than the final valuation. Salomon, HSBC and BZW picked the
ball up.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But it wasn't just the fact that the deal had been mandated for three years
and that two failures to take it to market had soured the experience for
the two banks: according to players close to the deal, Schroder lacked the
capital and CSFB wasn't comfortable with its distribution. In the end, though,
the IPO could have been bigger. After the government decided to allow foreign
participation, Dr35 billion ($140 million) of the issue was taken up by
overseas investors. <BR>
<BR>
Despite large demand for the first tranche of OTE, the second is unlikely
at least until April 1997, though the sale of OTE's cellular division is
likely to be sooner. <BR>
<BR>
Even such a small sale can have disproportionate effects on the stock exchange,
causing some market players concern. OTE and state banks account for a large
chunk of the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE). Says Haris Makkas, country treasurer
at Bank of America in Athens, &quot;with the entry of OTE, the state now
effectively manages over 40% of the ASE's capitalization. Past experience
with the results of state management are not encouraging. Moreover, young
private companies are crowded out.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Convincing other private companies to list on the exchange has not been
easy, and many large shipping, refinery and beverage companies remain on
the outside. ASE president Manolis Xanthakis expects only six or seven new
companies to launch on the ASE this year, citing the fact that the market
needs time to absorb new listings. <BR>
<BR>
The stock exchange is still small - before OTE, it was capitalized
at around $18 billion, with 210 listed companies - and it only recently
became a private company. There are undoubtedly good companies on the exchange
and the market is trading cheap (p/e ratios of around only eight times earnings
are expected by Xanthakis when 1995 results are made public). <BR>
<BR>
Xanthakis bemoans the lack of international interest in the exchange. &quot;The
major disadvantage is that some years this market doesn't show big price
returns. But that's like a chicken and egg situation - if managers
come and put considerable sums into this market, it will have a big effect
on price.&quot; He also blames the fact that the government has not allowed
him to increase staff on the exchange in order to improve its international
marketing effort. But even though only Xanthakis himself and one other executive
market the exchange, trading has bounded ahead over the past 10 years -
one average day's trading today is equal to turnover for all of 1986. <BR>
<BR>
Work on upgrading ASE's trading system to an electronic system is paving
the way for the introduction of new products. By autumn, between one-third
and one-half of all listed companies should have been switched to book-entry.
A draft law on futures and options is now in front of the capital markets
committee. <BR>
<BR>
But the fear of government interference still hangs over the ASE. Nowhere
was that more obvious than in the debacle surrounding the registration of
shareholders - mainly in construction companies, the third largest
group on the bourse. While construction stocks had already been hit by a
scandal surrounding the building of a casino, they were hit harder by the
registration row. <BR>
<BR>
The Athens Stock Exchange was forced to suspend 39 companies because they
missed a May 2 deadline to convert bearer shares into registered shares.
Firms that have state contracts worth more than Dr1 billion are subject
to mandatory share registration. Holders of stock that is not being traded
as a result of the registration law lose their entitlement to 1995 dividends
and voting rights. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The issue of regulation represents exactly the short-term view of
politicians,&quot; says John Marcopoulos, managing director of brokers Sigma
Securities. &quot;The background of the law was to avoid people using bearer
shares to bribe influential people for government projects.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A noble ambition perhaps. But the ruling specified registration right down
to the physical shareholder, a requirement Xanthakis opposed. &quot;Even
if the specification continues to exist, it won't be applied. It cannot.
It just creates a bad atmosphere for investors,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Turnover on the exchange was cut in half and foreign investors - especially
US institutions which were particularly hard hit - shunned the market.
Moreover, if a company such as OTE now wants to bid for a public entity
project, it will have to make its own shares registered down to the person.
This has created an administrative nightmare. &quot;The stock exchange is
suffering now what many think is a technical problem with registration,
but that's only one small part of the issue,&quot; says Makkas at Bank of
America. <BR>
<BR>
Although Xanthakis kicked up a fuss over the registration issue, some players
believe he could have taken a stronger stand. The whole issue threw into
sharp relief the fact that, even though the stock exchange is now legally
a private company, the government still has a big influence, right down
to appointing the president. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The government should make clear what it believes about the capital
markets,&quot; says Marcopoulos. &quot;One day they are pro, the next against.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
While Xanthakis is happy with the model of privatization provided by OTE,
the sale is not likely to be followed up by a sizeable privatization of
a public utility any time soon. &quot;If you put the question, 'what can
you privatize?', the answer is difficult,&quot; he says. &quot;Banks, electricity
and petroleum, and some smaller companies. I would be very happy to see
at least three or four of the smaller banks sold.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At the earliest, the public petroleum company could appear on the market
in 1997. The privatization is unlikely to be announced until clearer political
signals emerge from Pasok's party congress. Smaller than OTE, some estimates
put the value of the company at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, only
around 10% of which is likely to be privatized. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Then we'll put a stop on privatizing public enterprises for the time
being - for about one and a half years,&quot; says Avgouleas at the
national economy ministry. &quot;We do not believe in privatization at any
cost. We must always take account of the constraints of the economy.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
According to some players, the debate may be detrimental if it delays corporate
restructuring - particularly for the banks. &quot;The beginning of
a trend is the most difficult thing. If you start and are successful, the
rest will follow,&quot; says Xanthakis. For the larger banks, structural
reforms are already under way. National Bank of Greece - which is only
4% directly owned by the state, with the majority of the remainder owned
indirectly - is restructuring its group. This includes reducing non-performing
loans (10% of the total loan portfolio), increasing capital, liquidating
non-financial equity participation in certain mortgage and insurance companies,
and trying to change the convertible bond issued in 1992 into a bond that
would count as tier one or tier two capital. <BR>
<BR>
Biting the bullet is not easy since privatization is still politically explosive.
&quot;Both [political] parties are trying to resolve internal problems rather
than real issues,&quot; says Marinos Yannopoulos, executive general manager
of Alpha Credit Bank, the largest private sector bank in Greece.<p>

<H4>UNITED STATES </H4>
<H2>Warburg shows a slimmer profile </H2>
After months of delays, the New York Federal Reserve Bank is close to approving
Swiss Bank Corp's merger with SG Warburg in the US. But there will be a
lot less left to merge than originally expected. Uncertainty about the future
of the US piece of Warburg, combined with a post-integration reorganization
at SBC Warburg, has led to an exodus of investment bankers and analysts
in New York. <BR>
<BR>
The upshot is that Warburg now has a much smaller US equities presence.
Among those who have left are two high-profile members of the management
team, investment bankers Mike McCarty and Philip Keevil. The two had been
recruited in 1991 to build up the US investment banking effort and co-headed
the firm for a time. <BR>
<BR>
Swiss Bank confirms that Warburg New York has lost almost two-thirds of
its investment bankers, down from 64 to 25, and the number of equity analysts
has also declined dramatically, from 32 to nine. Total headcount is down
from nearly 500 to about 280. That may suit the Fed, which, say former Warburg
executives, has been uneasy about the extent of Swiss Bank's securities
operations in the US ever since it bought aggressive US derivatives dealer
O'Connor &amp; Partners. <BR>
<BR>
Adding in a relatively large Warburg equities business - at one time
it ranked ninth in trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange -
would be likely further to antagonize the regulator. Before Swiss Bank's
purchase of Warburg, says a former US Warburg executive, at least half of
Warburg's US and Canadian annual revenues of about $300 million came from
the US equities business. He estimates revenues have declined to about $100
million over the past year. An SBC Warburg spokesman in London says that
is speculation since the firm no longer breaks out its revenues along geographic
lines. <BR>
<BR>
In March, Swiss Bank paid a $3.5 million fine to settle charges from the
Fed, which claimed it was in violation of Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall
act, which separates commercial and investment banking. Section 20 limits
the types of securities business commercial banks can undertake in the US.
They are required to separate their securities business into a Section 20
subsidiary, and 90% of the revenues in that subsidiary have to come from
what are considered &quot;eligible&quot; securities, primarily those issued
by state and federal governments and municipalities. Only 10% can come from
ineligible securities, including equities, corporate bonds, derivatives,
and commercial paper. <BR>
<BR>
At issue, says a Swiss Bank spokesman in New York, was how to calculate
revenues from complicated capital markets instruments that contain derivatives,
and whether they can be broken into separate parts, some of which would
be considered ineligible. Although neither Swiss Bank nor the Fed would
go into detail, Swiss Bank has agreed to recalculate its revenues to suit
the regulator. <BR>
<BR>
The recent agreement between Swiss Bank and the Fed is seen as paving the
way for Fed approval of the Warburg merger. Former US Warburg executives
say that as part of making the deal work, Warburg would have to convince
the Fed that the foreign securities it sells in the US, a huge portion of
its US business which has been expanded, should be considered eligible securities.
<BR>
<BR>
A Swiss Bank spokesman says the New York retrenchment has nothing to do
with meeting the Fed's Section 20 requirements, but is part of a broader
global reorganization since integration. &quot;SBC Warburg made a decision
to focus on certain sectors, such as mining and telecoms, not the whole
waterfront. Most of our focus is in Europe and Asia.&quot; Now that the
global focus is on a few sectors, he explains, &quot;that has in effect
recast the corporate finance operation. It made it smaller in the United
States and smaller globally.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Previously the US bankers would call on anyone, but not now,&quot;
says the spokesman. <BR>
<BR>
The remaining senior member of the corporate finance group is Anthony Durrant,
head of the global mining group and a long-term Warburg employee in New
York. Besides McCarty and Keevil, other heavy-hitter investment bankers
who have left include Ralph Eads, who has taken his entire energy group
to Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, BJ Megargel, who has gone to BZW, Kim
Scott, who left for an LBO firm called American Enterprise Associates, and
Howard Grace, who has gone to Union Bank of Switzerland. Former chief financial
officer and chief administrative officer David McGirr, another ex-member
of the management committee, has also left. McCarty is now at NatWest's
Gleacher &amp; Co, an M&amp;A boutique, and Keevil has joined Salomon Brothers.
<BR>
<BR>
The other remaining members of the management team include chairman Tom
Wyman, who had planned to retire last summer but stayed on until the merger
was completed, at which time he will continue to be an adviser; counsel
Robert Errico; Ed Olsen, who is now running equities; and new member Nick
Millwood, head of the Latin American group. <BR>
<BR>
The handful of analysts left are primarily supporting investment bankers,
and their diminished number was also part of the reorganization design,
says the spokesman. Among those who have departed are Bill Duthridge, who
took his telecoms team to Bear Stearns last summer. Noted market strategist
Gail Dudack went to UBS. Among those who left after bonuses were announced
in March was Latin American analyst Carlos Patrinina, who has landed at
JP Morgan. <BR>
<BR>
As much as Swiss Bank protests, former New York Warburg investment bankers
say not all of the departures were of corporate design. Many US Warburg
executives had been excited about the merger, which they considered a good
strategic fit. But they quickly became disillusioned. &quot;It took me about
three months to figure out it wasn't gong to work,&quot; says one. &quot;The
interest the Swiss [bank] has in the United States was limited. They were
obviously focused on Europe.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The regulatory snafu didn't help, since it meant that Swiss Bank and Warburg
could not do anything together in the US. Swiss Bank made its application
to the Fed last July, and originally expected approval by September. The
date was moved to November, then January, then March, and insiders were
hoping it would occur by the end of April. <BR>
<BR>
But Glass-Steagall limitations were not something Swiss Bank was considering
when it originally purchased Warburg last spring. At that time, the US act,
which inhibits European universal banks from building a strong presence
in the US, seemed destined for death - finally. But once again, attempts
to dismantle Glass-Steagall failed in Congress last summer. Most recently,
SBC Warburg chief executive Marcel Ospel, in the bank's annual press briefing
in Basle in March, said the bank would consider buying additional US firms,
focusing on &quot;smaller-scale acquisitions aimed at filling niches in
our already strong US presence.&quot; Specifically, he mentioned building
corporate finance and research - interestingly the two areas now truncated.
And should Glass-Steagall disappear, former Warburg execs say, watch for
SBC Warburg being on the prowl for a bulge-bracket firm such as Lehman Brothers.

EXOTIC CURRENCY SWAPS </H4>
<H2>Swings and round-a-bahts </H2>
Stagnant forex markets in the US and Japan, and the push for a single currency
in Europe, will force banks to take a keener interest in the exotic currencies
of the Pacific Rim. &quot;G-10 currencies are over-researched and over-broked
and it is increasingly difficult for corporates and investors to be involved
in them profitably,&quot; says Avinash Persaud, head of currency research
at JP Morgan in London. &quot;Asian currencies have for some time become
increasingly important but I think 1996 will be their year of full emergence,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
The Malaysian ringgit will be the year's star among Asia's exotic currencies,
largely as a result of the US-Malaysian interest rate differential. A 1.45%
gap in the three-month rate has sparked an inflow of short-term funds. But
even in Malaysia, few commercial bank lenders will take longer-term risk
onto their own books. <BR>
<BR>
As ever, export financiers are blazing a trail with the shield of a sovereign
guarantee, the banking equivalent of an asbestos suit. The UK's Export Credit
Guarantee Department (ECGD) is set to announce its first credit denominated
in Malaysian ringgits. <BR>
<BR>
And even when such guarantees are hard to find, bankers are now exploring
techniques for using exotic currency swaps to transfer export credit agency
(ECA) support from hard-currency credits to subsidize loans made in emerging-market
currencies. Fixed-rate exotic-currency loans can be created through the
use of these swaps, enabling banks to offer competitive funding in currencies
not officially supported by ECAs. <BR>
<BR>
The received wisdom is that export-credit deals are so susceptible to delay
that using swaps within them is too risky. But the financial alchemists
at Standard Chartered, arranger of ECGD's first ringgit credit, tell a different
story. The bank has integrated its export-finance unit with its treasury
and derivatives units and has even gone so far as to put its export-finance
staff through a derivatives training programme. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Project sponsors and lenders in emerging countries will inevitably
be faced with large exposures in local currencies to cover local construction
costs and where the project revenue is denominated in local currencies,&quot;
says Graham Smith of Standard Chartered's structured-finance unit in London.
&quot;Overseas suppliers can gain a competitive advantage by offering medium-term
finance in local currency.&quot; Bolting a derivative onto a deal makes
this viable, while also reducing the cost of funds to borrowers if they
wish to borrow in their own currency. It also earns handsome margin for
the bank selling the derivative. <BR>
<BR>
Take the case of a Thai borrower which wants to borrow in Thai baht at a
five-year fixed rate to fund the purchase of equipment from a UK company.
If local commercial loan rates are prohibitively high, the borrower could
turn to the swap markets for an answer. The borrower first avails itself
of a sterling export credit in which there is generally a large subsidy
implicit compared with commercial sterling rates. A swap may be used to
convert the borrower's sterling obligation into one in Thai bahts. <BR>
<BR>
It's not an easy process because the markets for swaps between OECD and
exotic currencies are sometimes very thin. As the market for sterling-baht
trades is limited, two swaps must be undertaken. The first swap changes
the Thai company's sterling obligation into a US dollar obligation through
the swap bank paying the Thai borrower a rate of interest equivalent to
that which it is obliged to pay under the sterling export credit, receiving
in turn a repayment stream in dollars. The subsidy implicit in the sterling
export credit is stripped out and used to reduce the dollar interest rate
payable under the first swap. <BR>
<BR>
This dollar rate serves as the basis for a fixed-rate Thai baht loan with
an unusually low interest rate. In the second swap, the swap bank pays the
Thai borrower an equivalent rate of dollar interest to settle the obligations
created in the first swap, leaving the Thai borrower with an obligation
to pay in Thai baht at a fixed interest rate. The end result is that the
Thai borrower pays the swap bank a fixed rate in Thai baht that could be
about 60 basis points below the lowest rate available on the Thai commercial
loan market to the strongest borrowers and 1.25% below the rates previously
quoted to it for a similar loan. <BR>
<BR>
Borrowers can remove all foreign-currency risk by borrowing in their own
currencies. Money is also being lent at a lower interest rate and for longer
tenors than would be available on the local money markets. The swap bank
is arbitraging between two perceptions of the cost of the same currency
exposure and perhaps siphoning off up to 1% for itself. <BR>
<BR>
It is not yet a widely accepted technique. Some bankers wonder whether the
swap bank in this example is cashing in on a loophole in the ECA loan covenant.
&quot;We are not necessarily aware of all the deals that go through, but
we are monitoring the situation closely&quot;, says a spokesman for ECGD.
&quot;All the fixed-rate export finance deals are based on OECD consensus
rates and these can only be 1% over the relevant government bond rate. The
scope for making much through this supposed loophole is very limited.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Most bankers remain cautious. &quot;Using derivatives presents enormous
breakage risks,&quot; says Anne Aurileus, an export financier at Barclays
in New York, &quot;especially if you're faced with a seven-year drawdown
on a 15-year loan.&quot; Rival bankers agree. &quot;The use of derivatives
in developing markets is limited by the credit capacity of banks,&quot;
says Bruno Mejean, head of export finance at SocGen in New York. <B>Ronan

<H4>EUROPEAN EQUITIES </H4>
<H2>Big ambitions for smaller companies </H2>
Visionaries have long dreamed of trading European equities with equal ease
across the continent in a single super-exchange. They picture a market for
the continent's biggest blue chips. London's SEAQ International might once
have claimed to be that market. Continental exchanges have made ambitious
plans to link up. But it now seems a smaller companies exchange will be
Europe's first unified market. <BR>
<BR>
The ambition of the European Association of Securities Dealers came closer
to being realized last month. Its vision of a liquid pan-European stock
market for smaller companies, Easdaq, looks increasingly viable. Easdaq
now has 43 shareholders, which together have invested over &#163;4 million
($5.9 million) in the venture. This represents over half Easdaq's intended
starting capital. Just as important though, it also means Easdaq has raised
enough to satisfy the recognition requirements of the Belgian authorities,
with which the company is registered. Backers include UK insurer and pension
fund Equitable Life, which has put up $250,000, ING Bank and UBS Securities.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The trading patterns, regulatory bodies and settlement systems are
either in place, or will be soon,&quot; says Tony Preece, Easdaq's head
of market development. &quot;We hope to open trading by late September -
but it will be tight.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Isma (the International Securities Markets Association), based in London's
Docklands, will run the automated-quotation trading system. This will be
modelled on its existing trade-confirmation system (Trax) for the Eurobond
market. The exchange will be quote-driven by market-makers but includes
&quot;an in-built ability for periodic order-matching of securities&quot;.
Clearing and settlement will be performed internationally by Intersettle,
a subsidiary of Swiss company Sega. &quot;Intersettle is a young and lively
firm, like us, and functionally very advanced,&quot; adds Preece. &quot;Transactions
can be settled in real time - trade plus a matter of minutes, if need
be.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
As its name suggests, Easdaq is modelled on Nasdaq (the North American Securities
Dealers' Automated Quotation system), which started operations in 1971 and
is now the second-largest US market after the New York Stock Exchange. <BR>
<BR>
Easdaq hopes to provide a similar service - helping bring high-growth
companies to a market of wider European investors. Preece states that &quot;20
or 30 companies have already expressed an interest in listing with Easdaq&quot;.
Companies cannot confirm their intentions to list until May, when the regulations,
confirming Easdaq's status as an exchange officially registered with the
Belgian authorities, are complete. Of those firms that have shown &quot;genuine
interest&quot;, over half are European companies already listed on Nasdaq.
Preece also notes that some US domestically registered firms have made enquiries
about listing with Easdaq to reach a wide range of European investors. <BR>
<BR>
Nasdaq itself is a small shareholder in Easdaq but no formal business link
exists beyond that. As Preece points out: &quot;We see Nasdaq as an experienced
uncle - someone to turn to for advice. But in many ways we are in competition
with them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Easdaq is not the first company to create a pan-European equity exchange.
Euroquote attempted a co-operative venture of listing between various domestic
European exchanges in the 1980s -- in an attempt to curtail expensive dual
listing. Preece points out that it had two disadvantages. First, the EU's
Investment Services Directive (ISD) wasn't operating, so brokers had also
to register in each of the countries in which they wished to deal. This
meant, secondly, that a standard trading pattern couldn't be agreed. &quot;It
never really took off,&quot; says Preece. &quot;Now the ISD is in place
Easdaq has a perfect opportunity.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Then again, so do rival companies. Current operating exchanges could also
benefit from the chance of attracting investors from across Europe given
by the ISD and accompanying prospectus directive. No longer do security
dealers authorized by one member state have to register in each country
in which they wish to operate. <BR>
<BR>
A second piece of EU legislation allows a prospectus acknowledged by one
EU-recognized body to be authorized throughout all member states. Both directives
have been effective since January. Easdaq, although doubtless welcomed by
the EU, is not linked with the EU at all. Preece accepts this: &quot;Essentially,
if we don't do it someone else will.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Indeed competition already exists for Easdaq. A London Stock Exchange spokeswoman
points out the success of the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment
Market (AIM). This LSE subsidiary began operations last June with 10 smaller
companies listed. It has already achieved its first-year target of 140 listings,
trading volume has exceeded &#163;692 million and over &#163;243 million
of new equity capital has been raised by AIM companies. <BR>
<BR>
Recently the Paris Bourse also set up Le Nouveau March&eacute; to cater
for high-growth companies. Preece notes, though, that many companies interested
in listing on Easdaq are &quot;new firms which wish to raise equity through
a wider base than on their domestic bourse&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Easdaq must differentiate itself from established European exchanges. This
is because, in theory, thanks to the two recent EU directives, these domestic
bourses can list the young companies Easdaq wishes to attract, and offer
them an equally wide European investor base. Easdaq's success will depend
on how well it markets its special characteristics. Preece notes this when
he says: &quot;We are registered in Brussels. We didn't want to be in London,
Frankfurt or Paris for obvious competitive reasons.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
One difference is that Easdaq has no obligation to list domestic companies,
unlike national bourses. Another is that Easdaq allows equal access, regardless
of nationality, to both investors in and issuers of equity, throughout Europe
and beyond. <BR>
<BR>
Attempts have been made to link domestic European bourses, smaller than
London, on one electronic platform, since the EU directives came into force
at the beginning of the year. Notably, the Deutsche B&ouml;rse and Paris
SBF circulated a letter of intent last October to create a common trading
platform. However, this has been delayed by technical problems and trouble
harmonizing rules for double listing. Walter Allwicher of the Deutsche B&ouml;rse
says this project &quot;moves in the same direction as Easdaq&quot; but
refers principally to larger companies already listed on either exchange.
<BR>
<BR>
Although Easdaq may be, as the LSE spokeswoman suggests, &quot;hardly off
the ground yet&quot;, if high-growth companies, attractive to investors,
emerge as firms which will list with Easdaq after May, the launch could
then rocket in September. <B>Christopher Spink</B> <BR>

<H4>UK SYNDICATED LOANS </H4>
<H2>Scratching around for good deals </H2>
Syndicated loan arrangers were given pause for thought when UK trade secretary
Ian Lang blocked National Power's agreed bid for Southern Electric on April
24, just a day after its &#163;2.2 billion three-year acquisition financing
had entered syndication. One banker said: &quot;We had all asked ourselves
at the beginning of this year, how we were going to keep busy and had all
said: 'M&amp;A finance.' That has worked, so far. But I am already wondering
what on earth we are going to do next year.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Banks in the syndicated loan market are, as ever, struggling to make a decent
return. Margins on loans to good-credit borrowers remain obstinately low
- sometimes near the so-called psychological limit of 10 basis points
over Libor and 5bp in commitment fees. It is almost impossible for banks
to lend at lower rates without losing money. Although margins have little
room to decline further, &quot;rates available on the capital markets mean
high margins are unlikely to return&quot;, says a banker at Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell. <BR>
<BR>
And with so many corporates obtaining vanilla loan finance at last year's
favourable rates, volumes are low. Arranging banks cannot rely on a steady
stream of fee earnings to compensate for low margins. <BR>
<BR>
Total volume for this year in the European loan market reached $40 billion
by the end of the first quarter, from 152 deals. The corresponding figures
for the first quarter of 1995 were $95 billion from 468 deals. <BR>
<BR>
The one bright spot for 1996 is M&amp;A financing, with a handful of large
deals, such as those in the UK utility sector, keeping volumes up. It also
offers higher margins. In late April, bankers were buzzing with rumours
of the likely pricing for the &#163;8 billion loan for The Southern Company
of the US, to fund a takeover bid for UK power generator National Power.
Bankers say that decent-quality credits which might command margins in the
low teens for standby credits may pay closer to 30bp on takeover loans.
<BR>
<BR>
It's just as well that banks receive some decent spreads because participating
in conventional loans brings a poor mix of return and risk even for lenders
to top-quality credits. For some time now, UK and European companies have
been requesting weaker covenants packages. If banks don't agree to these,
they risk losing market share to less-cautious lenders. Pricing grids -
which allow for margins to rise if a borrower's credit rating falls -
are still rare outside the US, although National Grid has allowed for this
on its latest &#163;800 million revolver. That's slim compensation for banks
being asked to commit funds at 12bp over Libor with a 6bp commitment fee
on the first five years of a loan to a borrower that offers limited prospect
for more profitable ancillary business. <BR>
<BR>
Chris Scott, assistant general manager of syndications at Sumitomo Bank,
says the bank considers each case individually. But he emphasizes that &quot;numerical
guarantees [in covenants included in loan documentation] are an Anglo-American
tradition&quot;, and that many continental borrowers don't expect to have
to give them. <BR>
<BR>
One solution is to cede some market share among high-grade borrowers seeking
loose-covenant packages but to gain through yields on other higher-return
deals. Now banks are looking to two sources of new assets in 1996: takeover
finance, and structured deals for lower-rated or more complex borrowers.
<BR>
<BR>
Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) recently raised $310 million for Angolan
oil and gas company Sonangol, with a margin of 2% to 2.13% over Libor. The
deal was significantly oversubscribed and was increased from $250 million.
Yet UBS claims to be tough on credit quality: &quot;Our policy is to maintain
credit standards,&quot; says Brenda Mills, a vice-president at UBS. &quot;Each
loan is done on a case-by-case basis, but we have a responsibility to extract
appropriate guarantees. If we miss out on a few deals as a result, then
so be it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It is only a matter of time before more banks start chasing this kind of
business. Mills says lower-rated borrowers will be able to drive margins
down as more banks turn their attention towards them. <BR>
<BR>
Greater competition is becoming evident in management buy-out (MBO) financing,
where pricing on smaller deals can be 100bp and more. The eight-year, &#163;165
million ($243 million) loan arranged by Bank of Scotland for the buy-out
of British Alcan from ALCOA pays 200bp over Libor. In April, Credit Suisse
began syndicating a &#163;95 million buy-out financing, also paying 200bp
over Libor, for Newsquest Media, the KKR-backed vehicle which bought Reed
Elsevier's regional newspaper business. <BR>
<BR>
More and more Japanese and European commercial banks are hiring staff and
hoping to compete with the longer established MBO loan arrangers: Bank of
Scotland, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Fuji Bank, NatWest Markets and Royal
Bank of Scotland. The latter's head of syndications, Christopher Elliot,
says: &quot;There doesn't appear to be any shortage of liquidity for MBOs.
It's a very active market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In M&amp;A financing, even though returns may be higher, traditional lenders
face unwelcome competition from investment banks. These have tried to expand
into syndicated loans, starting in the growing secondary market in participations.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Unfortunately, we are sometimes perceived as a threat, because we
go for leading roles in prestigious deals,&quot; says Simon Parry-Wingfield,
executive director of the European loan group at Goldman Sachs. Investment
banks, with their high cost of capital, are leaving the simpler deals alone
- they can't keep large volumes for long. But these firms advise companies
on complex issues like M&amp;A deals, so it's a natural step for them to
be more involved in leading precisely the higher-margin takeover financings
which traditional bank lenders covet. <BR>
<BR>
On occasion they can claim to have expanded the market, rather than stolen
market share from others. The &#163;210 million loan for North &amp; South
Railways, financing the buy-out of British Rail's freight business by a
US investor group led by Wisconsin Central Transport, might not have happened
had Goldman Sachs not been prepared to take it on. That loan was split into
a &#163;155 million senior portion paying 200bp over Libor for six-and-a-half
years and a &#163;55 million, eight-year subordinated piece. <BR>
<BR>
Goldman is not the only investment bank to cross between capital markets
and syndicated loans. Nomura has also made a place for itself. In March,
it launched a multi-tranche asset-backed Eurobond for rolling-stock company
Angel Trains, secured against flows of lease income to the borrower from
19 UK train operating companies. It also began arranging a &#163;400 million
credit facility to finance additions to the company's rolling stock. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile traditional commercial bank lenders with investment banking subsidiaries
are also keen to promote their full service skills. A case in point is BZW.
It now incorporates the loan syndications team which previously operated
separately within BZW's parent, Barclays Bank. <BR>

<H4>LETTER </H4>
<H2>IDB answers back </H2>
Sir, <BR>
<BR>
We were surprised to see that <I>Euromoney</I>, a respected and widely read
magazine, would publish a story (March 1996) on the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB), the region's major source of multilateral finance, without verifying
the facts. The story combined misleading information with innuendo to construct
a picture of the Bank that is not consistent with the image our shareholders
have, judging from the support they continue to demonstrate for the Bank,
most recently and eloquently expressed by them at our April 1996 Annual
Meeting in Buenos Aires. <BR>
<BR>
The IDB is working closely with our borrowing members in many challenging
areas that are new both for the Bank and the countries. This has required
the Bank to become a leaner, more flexible, and more dynamic institution.
To that end, a serious effort of organizational restructuring, and revision
of policies and procedures, has taken place in recent years, drawing on
experience and on best practice from inside and outside the Bank, and with
the full participation of our Board, of management and of staff. We are
proud of the process and the outcome of our modernization effort. <BR>
<BR>
It is regrettable that your reporter did not take the opportunity to meet
with the Bank's president, or apparently, with any senior managers currently
in the Bank. The president, the vice president, our shareholders and their
representatives on our board of directors, are committed to the path taken
with our 1994 reorganization, and are enthusiastic about the prospects for
the region and the Bank in the years ahead. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Muni Figueres de Jim&eacute;nez</I> <BR>
<I>External Relations Advisor</I> <BR>
<I>Inter-American Development Bank</I> <BR>
<I>Washington, DC 20577</I> <BR>
<BR>
The author, Steven Irvine, replies: <I>Euromoney</I> was surprised by the
content of the external relations advisor's letter. I did see the people
she says I didn't see, and was in fact accompanied by a member of her department
to the office of the vice-president and the bank's general counsel. I also
saw several executive directors and a large selection of senior managers.
Unfortunately the president was not in Washington during my visit. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Euromoney</I> further notes that at the IDB's annual meeting in Buenos
Aires in April 1996, criticism was publicly levelled at the chief economist
by shareholders, including Brazil, Mexico and the US, and by the IMF. <I>Euromoney</I>
stands by its story. <BR>

<H1>Pace starts to slacken </H1>
IT WAS a lacklustre week for new issues in the international debt markets
as many of the major issuers and intermediaries gathered in London for the
Euromoney Global Borrowers and Investors Forum. <BR>
<BR>
After the hectic pace of last month, this week's sparse activity may be
the start of one of the longest summer slowdowns ever, with few major deals
in the pipeline. <BR>
<BR>
One long-awaited new issue that did emerge was the debut global <I>Pfandbrief
</I>for RheinHyp. Lead managers Commerzbank, Merrill Lynch and UBS reported
strong demand for the DM2bn five-year transaction, but other syndicate managers
reported limited interest for Deutschmark product in a quiet week. The debut
issue for Bankgesellschaft Berlin could be put on ice awaiting better conditions.
<BR>
<BR>
Short-dated paper in the dollar sector remained the flavour of the week,
with the notable exception of a $750m 10-year subordinated issue for ABN
AMRO Bank, via ABN and Salomon Brothers. Again views on the deal were mixed,
although syndicate officials reported some strong demand from the US. <BR>
<BR>
The IFC is expected to take bids shortly for a $500m five-year bond -- price
talk for any such deal is around 10bp-12bp over Treasuries. <BR>
<BR>
The 10-year sterling deals for the Halifax and JFM emerged as anticipated.
Halifax raised &#163;400m of subordinated debt to rejig its balance sheet
ahead of demutualisation. <BR>
<BR>
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale is said to be looking at a
&#163;100m subordinated perpetual with a spread of around 100bp over to
the 10-year step-up, and Bristol &amp; West is expected shortly with a sterling
FRN. <BR>
<BR>
The most interesting issues were seen in the equity-linked market, where
the Republic of Italy raised Lit1.8tr and $1.17bn of bonds exchangeable
into shares or ADRs of insurance group INA. Both tranches were lead managed
by Goldman Sachs and IMI. <BR>
<BR>
And in the emerging markets, the United Mexican States is raising a whopping
$3bn with a loan-style five-year floater lead managed by JP Morgan and SBC.

<H3> <B>MARKET MONITOR</B> </H3>

 <P> <B>Edited by Peter Lee </B>

<H3> <B>US CREDIT CARDS</B> </H3> <H3> <B>Plastic profits approach meltdown</B>
</H3> <P> Few lines of US bank business have proved as profitable or as seemingly
failure-proof as consumer lending through credit cards. After all, what other
loans carry interest rates close to 20% and a 50% return on equity? Bankers all
wanted to get a piece of the action. As a result, there are 7,000 US bank card
issuers. Over the past two years these have mailed out an astonishing 5 billion
card offers &#173; many of them "pre-approved"&#173; to college and high-school
students, as well as to the unemployed. Now credit card profitability has been
almost halved and might even vanish altogether.

<P> In many cases, bankers have brought the problems on themselves. The US
economy may be in a recovery phase, but the boom in credit card lending over the
past two years has led to a 15-year high in delinquencies and rising
bankruptcies. The banks' second quarter earnings figures indicate that loss
ratios of credit card portfolios had risen by an average 40 basis points (bp)
during the quarter, notes bank analyst George Salem of Gerard Klauer Mattison in
New York.

<P> "Credit cards will clearly be the most troubled loan category for US banks in
1996 and 1997," Salem wrote in an prescient report published in June. In the
past, the credit card business boasted an average 300bp return on assets (ROA).
Since the second quarter rise in charge-offs, Salem estimates ROA is down to
160bp and is likely to deteriorate further. The veteran banking analyst, who has
a reputation for sounding alarm bells long before other analysts and even
regulators take notice, says "the profit will collapse" if there is a recession.

<P> The report has attracted the attention of the regulators and Salem believes
these may ask the banks to assign more capital or reserves to cover card risk,
particularly for bank loans that have been securitized and are off balance sheet
but still carry residual risk for the issuers. Banks currently reserve few, if
any, funds for losses there.

<P> Among the major banks most vulnerable to a downturn in profitability are
Citicorp, which Salem calculates earned 30% of its total income from net credit
card receipts in 1995, First Chicago, which earned 27%, Chase Manhattan Bank
(19%) and Bank of New York (18%).

<P> Regulators have also begun to speak out. In a speech to the New York State
Bankers Association in June, comptroller of the currency Eugene Ludwig stated
that the credit card issue was a "real problem that neither regulators nor the
banking industry can ignore". He noted that Federal Reserve data showed card debt
rising at an alarming 20% annual rate in April, three times faster than income
growth.

<P> However, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan played down the risks in
response to a question after his semi-annual speech on the economy before the
Senate banking committee last month. He argued that interest rates on cards are
still sufficiently high to cover large losses and that the Fed's loan-officer
surveys indicate that banks are beginning to rein back on marketing. But the
extent to which this is a response to the debt build-up is questionable. Analysts
acknowledge that, as the escalating bankruptcies seem to indicate, the market may
be saturated. Salem's research concluded that, on average, every American between
the ages of 18 and 64 was offered about $130,000 in credit lines during the
two-year marketing blitz.

<P> Greenspan's sanguine view echoes those of the bankers. A Citicorp spokesman
noted that while costs and charge-offs were up during the second quarter, growth
in the US portion of the portfolio has slowed &#173; to 12%. The leading credit
card issuer reported that credit losses in the US rose by $55 million and the
loss ratio rose to 4.99% during the quarter, up from 4.38% in the first quarter.
In line with Greenspan, Citicorp argues that the rates charged for its cards are
high enough so that there is "a lot of room for bankrupties".

<P> But Salem argues it's precisely this philosophy that has created problems.
"You're heating up the risk," he says. Moreover, high rates are being charged to
those with the least capacity to pay. Salem found that card usage by lower-income
families (incomes under $25,000) has almost doubled over the past decade, while
it has been flat for those with incomes of between $25,000 and $50,000. In
families with incomes above $50,000, card usage has declined. Bankruptcy lawyers
interviewed by Salem attributed the rise in bankruptcies to excessive card debt,
often amounting to between 50% and 150% of annual income. His research indicates
that bankruptcy filings are likely to increase by 31% this year. Yet his survey
of bankers shows that many lenders fail to verify or even ask for employment
status or annual income. One banker, claimed this was "'too expensive to verify".

<P> Why worry about underwriting when you can securitize your loans and, at least
theoretically, turn the loans over to investors? Few have done this more
aggressively than Citicorp, which has securitized 62% of its $42 billion credit
card portfolio. Salem believes this makes it particularly vulnerable to questions
about the adequacy of reserves for these loans.

<P> Securitization is a murky area that could cause banks unforeseen problems.
For accounting purposes and so that securities can gain an AAA rating, the
securities are considered a sale. But critics have argued that securitization is
merely an off balance sheet financing that enables banks to avoid posting capital
for the loans and to finance credit cards at lower rates of interest, by virtue
of the AAA rating offered through third party financial guarantees. Salem argues
that securitization is the "glue that has prevented credit card profitability
from deteriorating sooner", and thinks a decline in securitization that is bound
to follow rising credit card delinquencies will "adversely affect capital
adequacy and costs of funds for the banks".

<P> As the rating agencies see it, whether securitized cards belong to the bank
or investors is a question of semantics. "The securitization is a temporary
transfer of risk," notes Ed Bankole, a securitization analyst at Moody's
Investors Service. Adds Standard &amp; Poor's bank analyst Tanya Azarchs:
"Securitization does not wind up off-loading a lot of the business risk of
managing these accounts or the credit risk." Citicorp, however, insists that the
ultimate risk lies with the investor. But, admits the Citi spokesman, "he's
clearly got a lot of things to enhance the credit".

<P> When card receivables are securitized, the bank still manages the individual
account: it can increase the credit limit, change the interest rate and so on.
The pool of securities, known as a master trust, is a complicated structure that
is constantly being replenished by new loans, so that its outstanding level
remains stable. Likewise, to keep paying investors, charge-offs must be
compensated for with new loans.

<P> For example, according to Citicorp, its master trust had a total yield of
18.6% in June. But the weighted average coupon investors received was only 6.57%.
The trust had a net principal loss of 5.82% in June and paid fees to the bank of
0.79% for total expenses of 13.18%. The bank's spokesman says Citi does not set
aside reserves to cover losses in its securitized portfolio. But the excess cash
of 5.5% is the "investor's protection", he explains. The excess cash is recorded
on the bank's statement as fee income. Should the trust have to use some of that
cash to pay for additional charge-offs, there would be a charge against income.
"For this trust to go under water, the losses would in effect have to double," he
argues.

<P> Citi's yield of 18.6% is above the industry average, making it relatively
immune to major problems. Azarchs says that the trusts, which control $162
billion of securitized credit card loans, now have an average 16% yield, compared
with 19% two years ago, since competition between issuers is lowering rates
charged to consumers. But that also lowers the margin for error. The greatest
problems are likely to surface at monolines (banking institutions whose sole
business is credit cards), which securitize about 80% of receipts and have been
the most aggressive in cutting rates. But analysts say it is hard to predict the
effect that their woes would have on the rest of the industry.

<P> Bankers are trying to put the matter in the best light, many arguing that the
second quarter's increase in charge-offs was the peak. But Azarchs doesn't think
the second quarter was "much reassurance". She notes that charge-off levels are
currently around 5.5% for seasoned portfolios (most charge-offs don't occur until
the borrower has had the card for at least two years), which was the same level
experienced during the 1991 recession. "And," she says, "we haven't got a
recession."

<H3> <B>INTERNATIONAL EQUITY</B> </H3> <H3> <B>Honesty is the best policy</B>
</H3> <P> Investors in British Energy, holding company for the UK's nuclear power
generators, suffered a nasty surprise at the climax of the company's
privatization in July. Just hours after the retail offer for shares had closed
over-subscribed, the company announced that two of its eight sites had been
completely shut down for safety inspections.

<P> The company had long scheduled routine inspections at Hinkley Point in
south-west England and Hunterston in Scotland. One of the two sister reactors at
each site was due to be closed. On July 4, a tiny crack was found in a steam pipe
at Hinckley and, following advice from engineers, the company's safety committee
decided late on July 9, the eve of closure for the retail offer, to shut down the
other two reactors for inspection.

<P> That news was not made public for another 12 hours while a board meeting was
convened, and a statement drafted and circulated to armies of investment bankers,
lawyers and public relations advisers working for the company and for the UK
Department of Trade and<B> </B>Industry. By the time the BBC broadcast the news
on the afternoon of July 10, the retail offer had been closed for two hours.

<P> The affair reminded some investors of the second sale of stock in the UK's
conventional power generators, National Power and PowerGen, in 1995, when an
aggressive announcement by electricity regulator Stephen Littlechild, on the day
after the deal closed, hammered the share price.

<P> Amir Eilon, co-head of equity capital markets at BZW, a global coordinator on
both deals, dismisses the comparison: "The Littlechild announcement raised the
possibility of a real change in the operating environment for the regional
electricity companies (RECs) and got investors worried about possible knock-on
effects for the generators. By contrast, these shut-downs did not indicate any
change. They show what the business of British Energy is all about. This company
operates middle-aged kit which it regularly closes down, inspects, repairs and
gets running again."

<P> At the board meeting on Wednesday morning, bankers had had to decide whether
or not the closures were a significant enough event to require a rewriting of the
share sale prospectus. They decided they did not.

<P> Nevertheless a tumbling US stock market and nervous UK share traders
undermined the British Energy issue. Partly-paid shares fell quickly from 105p to
89p on massive turnover in a wave of selling which hit the deal in the first 20
minutes of trading. BZW traces this to three sources: two institutions sold out;
a number of retail brokers began selling immediately on behalf of small investors
hoping to stag the deal; and, most overwhelmingly, London-based market-makers,
worried about the direction of the UK market, used the liquidity of the new issue
to set up short positions.

<P> BZW stepped back from this plummeting market. But in the following days its
efforts at stabilization looked more successful. By the end of July, partly-paid
shares had recovered to 99p in a volatile, generally weak UK stock market. Eilon
says: "The price is now 1% to 2% off the UK market since the time of the float,
and no institution will worry about that. As for those who hoped to make a quick
killing &#173; that's not what privatizations should be all about."

<P> Rival bankers say institutions received higher allocations of British Energy
shares than they really wanted or expected, and this contributed to frantic early
trading. In most successful privatizations, stock is scarce and institutions
inflate their orders, expecting to receive no more than 40% of what they request.
In this case, they received fuller allocations and then sold out. Eilon says that
some institutional orders evaporated late in the bookbuilding due to market
volatility and news of the reactor shut-downs. For those who remained,
allocations varied widely, depending on the global coordinator's view of the
quality of investors. "Some received zero, some 25% of their orders, some took
75% plus," says Eilon. "There was very little cutting and running in the
after-market."

<P> BZW had already priced the deal at 203p fully paid, the bottom of its
indicated range of between 200p and 230p. This reflected a variety of investor
concerns, including the scale of future liabilities for decommissioning reactors,
reprocessing spent fuel and disposing of waste. It's a complicated company to
value, with operating cash flow perhaps more important than reported earnings.

<P> Because of its high fixed costs, British Energy will only be a good
investment if it can increase its output by either extending the operational life
of its power stations or reducing the number of unscheduled shut-downs. The
company has increased its stations' available generating time from 52% in 1991 to
71% in 1996.

<P> So the unscheduled closures, though a fact of life for British Energy, marked
a poor start to life as a privatized company.

<P> Still, the unscheduled inspections turned up nothing unpleasant. The safety
record at British Energy is good. The International Atomic Energy Agency uses a
scale of 1 to 7 for nuclear events: 1 signifies an anomaly; 5 a serious accident
with off-site risks (as at Three Mile Island in 1979); and 7 a major accident (as
at Chernobyl). Since 1990, British Energy has only reached level 2 (incident) on
three occasions.

<P> A spokesperson for British Energy says that the decision to close the
reactors at such a critical moment in the share offer shows the company's regard
for safety and its openness with the public. "It would have been easier to sit on
it. But if we had, that might really have rebounded on us later." Nice to know
they considered all the options.

<H3> <B>INTERNATIONAL BONDS</B> </H3> <H3> <B>Angry boycott mars triumphant bond
issue </B> </H3> <P> On July 11 Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais, with Merrill Lynch and
Morgan Stanley, launched a Ffr40 billion bond for special-purpose vehicle
Cyber-Val 07-96, the largest ever bond issue in the international capital
markets. Despite the size &#173; equivalent of $7.74 billion &#173; the bonds
sold out by launch.

<P> But jubilation threatened to turn to dismay as an acrimonious row broke out
over allocations of bonds. Three French banks &#173; Banque Nationale de Paris,
Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts et de Consignations and Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale &#173; boycotted the issue, citing meagre allocations of
just 1% of the issue each. While the syndication policy was the sticking point,
the ire sprang from wider concerns, including the role of state aid to
Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais and the prominent role played by two US houses.

<P> The Cyber-Val transaction still marks a considerable achievement. Employing
the technology of securitization, it parcelled up part of a loan made at the end
of last year by Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais to the Etablissement Public de Financement
et Restructuration, a quasi-governmental body charged with managing the sell-down
of soured assets from the troubled French bank. The trick: to harness the zero
capital adequacy risk weighting of the loan to create an attractive asset that
could be marketed to external investors and thereby free up liquidity for
Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais.

<P> That loan &#173; originally Ffr145 billion but amortized down to Ffr118
billion by the time of the launch &#173; had been advanced as part of the 1995
restructuring agreement between Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais and the French government:
a crucial element was that the loan was made at just 85% of the TME overnight
money market rate &#173; well below Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais' blended cost of
funding &#173; in exchange for government participation in the restructuring.

<P> Selling off part of the loan meant carving it into two separate tranches
&#173; a Ffr40 billion A loan with market coupon rates to back the Cyber-Val
bonds and a B tranche with rates adjusted downwards to arrive at an over-all rate
equivalent to 85% of the TME rate. The Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais securitization team
had to convince the French Tr&eacute;sor that these terms would not invite
objection from the EU's competition authorities, who had agreed to the original
restructuring.

<P> The B loan effectively remained on the balance sheet of Cr&eacute;dit
Lyonnais; but selling the A tranche through the Cyber-Val vehicle allowed it to
free up Ffr40 billion of cash, so it was important the overall transaction was
not seen to give undue competitive advantage to the bank.

<P> Despite being below market rate of interest, the underlying loan was always
going to prove attractive raw material for a securitization &#173; the
quasi-governmental nature of the borrower allowed the bonds to be constructed
with a triple-A rating from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. By the time of the
issue's launch, the bonds had already received a zero-risk weighting from France
and Luxembourg, and a 10% weighting in the UK.

<P> Carving the cash flow from the underlying loan to fashion a capital market
superstructure on top of the loans then became the key to the transaction. The
bonds were divided into four tranches, ranging in maturity from one to five
years. The five-year tranche was twice the size of the others &#173; at Ffr16
billion rather than Ffr8 billion &#173; but with half of that amount paid down
early in year four. "It was important to avoid cannibalization of the investor
base," says Michael Dee, head of syndicate at Morgan Stanley in London. The
deal's lead managers had judged that buyers would be wooed first by the near-cash
nature of the one-year tranche and the juicy yields on the five-year bonds. Only
then would attention turn to the intermediate classes.

<P> During marketing in the week immediately preceding the July 11 launch, demand
did in fact build broadly as expected, although the relative sluggishness of the
intermediate tranches led to the hiking of their price by 1 basis point over the
indicated price range. That was sufficient to ensure the deal was fully sold by
the deal's official launch.

<P> Domestic buyers dominated at the shorter end of the maturity spectrum;
overseas investors were more tempted at the longer end.

<P> Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley had already been chosen to add distribution
clout; the domestic banks' relatively junior role in such a potentially lucrative
transaction rankled all the more. "We were invited in for a very small amount
&#173; only 1% &#173; and that was not really serious," says Philippe Guyot, head
of new issues at Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts. "One per cent was a ridiculous
amount," agrees the syndicate head at another of the French banks that turned
down the deal.

<P> In domestic syndications, the main French banks typically receive between 5%
and 10% each of the issue to sell. But Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais and its two
co-leads said that the deal was too large to syndicate in the traditional manner
and that it was in any event a securitization, which had never been sold in
France with a conventional syndicate.

<P> "We recognize that this operation was quite special," responds Caisse des
D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts' Guyot. "We understand that the syndication could be more
like a Eurobond syndication than a domestic one &#173; we have no problem with
that &#173; but even in a Eurobond, you are not invited in for just 1%."
Syndicate officials at all three absentee banks privately indicate that
allocations of 3% &#173; maybe even 2% &#173; would have been enough to tempt
them in.

<P> Syndicate members estimate that fees on each 1% of bonds sold at the re-offer
could have garnered between Ffr250,000 and Ffr360,000. "We wanted more paper and
we wanted more fees," says one official. That was something they were entitled
to, they argue. "The primary market is based on reciprocity," says Guyot,
pointing out that French banks had continued to include Lyonnais in syndicates
throughout its troubles. For the private banks the background of state aid for
the troubled Lyonnais will have added to the rancour.

<P><P<br><br> <center><B>Corrections to June's Bank Atlas</B></center>

<P> The way we calculate equity figures for German banks led to some confusion.
We have always included profit participation certificates,
<I>Genu&szlig;scheine,</I> in our calculations; had we excluded them, Dresdner
Bank would have come second in the rankings and Commerzbank third. Eurastar,
which analyzed the data, will canvass German banks to gauge their opinion on
this, and next year's rankings will reflect the outcome.

<P> As a result of a mistake on our part, several banks were left out of the Top
200 rankings, despite appearing in their country lists. These banks were Republic
New York Corp, with a shareholders' equity of $3.0 billion, putting it in 132nd
place, CERA Bank of Belgium, ranking at 188 with $2.0 billion, and five German
banks: Bayerische Vereinsbank, with $8.0 billion in 45th; Bayerische Landesbank
($5.8 billion, 67th), Staatsbank Berlin ($5.0 billion, 82nd), Berliner Handels-

<H3>KERR'S PEOPLE  </H3>
<b>Ian Kerr </b>
<H2>Chris Goekjian </H2>
<H3>Chief executive, Credit Suisse Financial Products </H3>
In the family's native Armenia, the name means &quot;man with blue eyes&quot;.
Chris Goekjian admits to having trouble with his name. &quot;Within the
firm I was sometimes known as &quot;The Goat&quot; and my secretary used
to take many calls for Mr Gekko who was the villain arbitrageur and corporate
raider in the film <I>Wall Street</I>.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Goekjian wasn't enamoured with either name but his own has since become
synonymous with the continuing success of Credit Suisse Financial Products.
Is csfp the greatest City of London success story in the 1990s? Certainly
there are few companies which could match its earnings performance. The
company was founded by Allen Wheat and a team of nine derivatives specialists
from Bankers Trust. Wheat's reputation as a prodigious money-maker was already
established. At bt he was one of the rising stars within the bank. But Wheat
wanted independence, a chance to run his own show. He had talks with several
interested parties and, in early 1990, he struck a deal with Hans-Joerg
Rudloff, the then chairman and chief executive of Credit Suisse First Boston.
<BR>
<BR>
It was a perfect opportunity for both sides. Rudloff could sense the slowing
momentum of csfb as its core businesses, especially the international fixed
income group, matured or became increasingly commoditized. Derivatives would
provide a new profit surge. For Wheat the cs First Boston group offered
a better name than Bankers Trust. There was also the balance sheet muscle
offered by Credit Suisse, and access to the bank's worldwide client network
and commercial banking relationships. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Pilgrim fathers</B> <BR>
<BR>
The founding team which moved with Wheat from Bankers Trust included Goekjian,
Brady Dougan, Ben Weston, Dan McGanty, Jean-Christian Cheysson, Trevor Price
and Shinji Yamada. When Credit Suisse Financial Products was formed in February
1990, they were joined by Marcus Everard and Jim Healy from csfb. <BR>
<BR>
Having obtained the necessary banking licences, csfp began to trade in July
1990. The company made an instant impression in the young and booming derivatives
industry. Perhaps more importantly for Wheat and his team, csfp made almost
instant profits. By the end of 1990, after only five and a half months of
operation, csfp reported a profit after taxes of $14 million. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Start-up businesses in the financial services industry don't expect
to break even until year three, but csfp was probably profitable by the
end of the first month,&quot; comments a First Boston director in New York.
<BR>
<BR>
The best was yet to come. Despite breakneck expansion and recruiting -
the number of employees rose from 12 to 180 in the first year - csfp's
earnings soared. In 1991 the company earned $121 million net after tax,
in 1992 $137 million, in 1993 $304 million, in 1994 $248 million and in
1995 $270 million. In six years, with an initial starting capital of just
$150 million, csfp has earned in excess of $1 billion after tax. In each
of the last three years, csfp with just 900 employees, has earned more than
the whole of the cs First Boston group with around 5,500 employees. <BR>
<BR>
Not surprisingly the shareholders of csfp are delighted. When the company
was formed, the ownership was split equally between Credit Suisse and cs
First Boston. In 1994 both shareholders sold 10% of their equity to Swiss
Re. Credit Suisse retains control of csfp with 56% of the voting shares.
<BR>
<BR>
Wheat no longer has an executive role within csfp although he remains on
the board and is a senior adviser. In 1995 he handed csfp's reins to Goekjian
who was appointed chief executive. Out of the original Bankers Trust staffers
who moved with Wheat and the two cs First Boston staff, four - including
Goekjian - are still with csfp. Five have moved over to cs First Boston,
including Wheat who is president and chief operating officer. Only Dan McGanty
and Tony Illya (who resigned last month) are no longer with the group. <BR>
<BR>
Will csfp continue to be a gold mine for its lucky shareholders? The self-assured
Goekjian has no doubts about the future growth potential. He points out
that when csfp started in 1990, the main competitors were Bankers Trust,
jp Morgan, Paribas, Citicorp and Salomon Brothers. Today csfp, jp Morgan
and Merrill Lynch lead the field with sbc Warburg improving in fourth place.
The commanding position gives the company a definite marketing advantage.
Lower sales volume in the United States, reflecting reduced demand for the
most sophisticated derivatives products after the adverse publicity surrounding
Bankers Trust, has been compensated for by increased demand from east Asia.
csfp was able to avoid the Bankers Trust-type pitfalls by much tighter marketing
management and paying better attention to customer requirements. In the
few instances which have resulted in litigation, the disputes have been
settled out of court. <BR>
<BR>
While cs First Boston's high turnover of senior executives has been making
press headlines, key defections from csfp have been rare. csfp's attraction
as a work place is its own success and, of course, the rewards which accompany
that success. Management does not directly own any csfp equity but staff
enjoy performance-related awards and bonuses. The compensation of Goekjian,
Marcus Everard and other members of the management committee will certainly
match that of comparable senior executives at cs First Boston whose total
pay last year averaged around $2.5 million each. <BR>
<BR>
Goekjian enjoys skiing and running, and his family. His wife Kim has just
given birth to a baby girl, Lily Victoria. <HR>
<H2>Nick Cournoyer &amp; Mark Evans </H2>
<H3>Managing directors, Montpelier Asset Management </H3>
&quot;Psst! Wanna buy a bond fund?&quot; In most instances the response
would be a long yawn. Bond funds are dull. Bond funds are for the birds.
Bond funds are for people who can't think for themselves. <BR>
<BR>
But what about a bond fund which has risen by 21% in the first six months
of the year? Surely 21% sounds too high? Has there been a mistake? Are we
talking about an equity fund? Even if it's true, where's the catch? <BR>
<BR>
There isn't a catch for those investors who like a little adventure and
want to put some fizz into their fixed income portfolios. Enter the world
of Montpelier Asset Management started by Nicholas Cournoyer who cut his
teeth on Latin American debt restructuring with Chase Manhattan in New York.
There he formed Chase's acclaimed debt trading team before moving to London
in 1986 to create a similar operation for the bank. Mark Evans, 31, joined
Montpelier via the emerging markets debt group at Morgan Grenfell and ing
where he became managing director of ing (uk) Capital Limited when he was
only 29. <BR>
<BR>
To find Montpelier's office, forget a trek to the City or - heaven
forbid - Canary Wharf. Instead, tell the driver to swing past Harrods,
take a right into Montpelier Street and a second left into the chic Knightsbridge
backwater of Cheval Place. For the international set this is familiar stamping
ground. On the corner is top restaurant Montpeliano (no credit cards) and,
on Cheval Place itself, there is Shezan, which has been drawing the rich
and famous for 26 years. <BR>
<BR>
What's the secret of Montpelier's success among its small group of funds
with total assets at $100 million? The answer is not significantly different
from the basic Warren Buffett investment philosophy of &quot;find an undervalued
asset, buy it, hold it and watch it grow&quot;. But while Buffett bought
Cap Cities and Coca Cola, Cournoyer and Evans snapped up debt issued by
Bulgaria and the Ivory Coast. His first purchases of Bulgarian debt were
in 1991 when he paid seven to eight cents on the dollar. By late 1992 the
price had doubled to 15 cents and the Bulgarians, who know a bargain when
they see one, offered to buy back the entire debt at 10, with a view that
they would realistically have to pay as much as 12.5. However, the attention
which this attracted backfired on the Bulgarian bargain hunters and a wave
of speculative buying carried the bonds to between 27 and 28. When the Brady
agreement was reached in November 1992, the bonds soared again to more than
40%. Even Buffett might have been impressed. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fundamentalists</B> <BR>
<BR>
An eye for distressed sale opportunities allowed Cournoyer and Evans also
to score heavily on Ivory Coast bonds which traded as low as 4% in 1990,
rose to 30% in the emerging market boom of 1993 and currently trade <U>
</U> at around 20%. In addition, they made many new friends by anticipating
the improving position of Poland long before Moody's assigned an investment
grade baa3 credit rating to the country this January. <BR>

Cournoyer and Evans are fundamentalists first and opportunistic traders
second. Through Cournoyer's long involvement with the underlying debt, Montpelier
has become a recognized authority on the Bulgarian and Ivory Coast economies.
Last December the company launched its own specialist Bulgarian debt fund.
In the recent Micropal survey Montpelier's Consulta emerging markets fund
ranked sixth out of similar funds, with a 21.2% gain for the first six months
of the year. Can such a performance be maintained? Cournoyer and Evans see
no lack of future opportunities. &quot;The market perceives emerging market
debt either as sovereign credits which will never disappear or as toxic
waste - but they rarely differentiate correctly between the two,&quot;
comments Cournoyer. <HR>
<H2>Alexander Bridport </H2>
<H3>Managing partner, Bridport &amp; Cie, Geneva </H3>
&quot;Are you sure that there aren't too many financial service companies
in Switzerland already?&quot; In 1990, this was the question which friends
and potential investors asked Alex Bridport and his partners as they sought
to raise capital to form their own agency bond broking company in Geneva.
<BR>
<BR>
Even in the recession-affected markets of those days, Alex Bridport was
adamant that his business plan was viable. &quot;Perhaps one third of the
world's savings outside their country of origin are held in Switzerland.
Around 50% of that amount is held in bonds. Investors view their bond holdings
in Switzerland simply as an alternative to long-term deposits. Given the
size of that bond pool, we knew that there was a role for a totally independent
house which could provide strategic advice and reliable execution to the
managers of that pool.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Institutional investors as well as some wealthy private individuals shared
Bridport's enthusiasm. The initial subscribers, all of whom remain investors
today, included gni Limited, Cook &amp; Cie, Edgar de Picciotto (chairman
of Union Bancaire Priv&eacute;e), Laskarin sa (controlled by Pierre Mirabaud),
Harry Ferguson Holdings, Hon. Andrew Fraser, Kobe Steel, Sorbier (owned
by Syz family), Hunter &amp; Co and Edward Mayer (the well-known us lawyer
and motor racing enthusiast). The outside investors originally controlled
51% of the capital with the Bridport working partners holding 49%. Following
a recent buy-back of stock, these ratios have now been reversed. <BR>
<BR>
Alex Bridport also chose his partners well. He had been managing director
of Lehman Brothers (Suisse) after beginning his career at Kleinwort Benson
in London. Francois-Marie Monnet, head of research and of the firm's key
&quot;monitoring and surveillance&quot; group, was with Morgan Stanley and
Unigestion. Thomas Bartholdi, head of trading, worked for Deutsche Bank
(Suisse), Chase Manhattan and Samuel Montagu. Enrico Chincarini, head of
administration and operations was the European budget and reporting manager
for Union Carbide Chemical and Plastics (Europe).&quot;We have never had
to change our letterhead,&quot; comments Bridport. <BR>
<BR>
Why should portfolio managers turn to an agency broker? &quot;They like
the firm's independent position in the market and because we don't assume
risk positions, act as underwriters or make markets in securities,&quot;
says Bridport. <BR>
<BR>
What's the future of Bridport &amp; Cie? Because it takes years to break
properly into the Swiss portfolio manager community, there are probably
several us investment banks and European commercial banks which would covet
b &amp; Cie's network and profitability. But are suitors likely to meet
some stiff resistance from Bridport and his partners? A friend in London
says: &quot;Remember that Alex's family is directly descended from Lord
Nelson of Trafalgar and that his own names are Alexander Nelson Hood which
sounds like the advance Royal Navy flotilla at the Battle of Jutland.&quot;
Potential bidders should take care not to be blown out of the water.

<H4><B>Credit squeeze threatens defaults</B></H4>
Mortgages are like wines, they have vintages. Deciding which mortgage is
most at risk of default largely consists of looking at its age, because
default rates rise steadily over the first four years, before tapering off.
<BR>
<BR>
Over the past six months, however, higher default rates have been creeping
up on US mortgage lenders and on the holders of the mortgage-backed securities
(MBSs) they issue. A study published in March by the New Jersey-based Mortgage
Research Group (MRG) provides the bleakest evidence yet that a credit squeeze
is under way. <BR>
<BR>
Mortgages issued in 1994 and 1995 are showing higher rates of default than
anyone had previously suspected. &quot;The trend was so pronounced,&quot;
says Gordon Monsen, president of MRG and a former head of mortgage research
at Bear Stearns, &quot;that 1994 originated loans, which were 17 months
into seasoning, were defaulting at rates comparable to 1992 loans with more
than 40 months of seasoning.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Western states are suffering the most. Mortgage default rates in California
have climbed to 0.6% as cash-strapped consumers, caught by the negative
equity on their homes, are assuming more debt than they can afford to service.
<BR>
<BR>
Rising credit card bills provide early-warning signals to holders of MBSs.
&quot;When some guy is running up a massive credit card bill, it often means
that he's out of work and ultimately that he might have to sell his house,&quot;
says Monsen. &quot;But more and more homeowners have decided to walk away
- to default - because their houses are worth less than their mortgages.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The signals could hardly be more ominous. Outstanding credit card receivables
in the US have risen from $680 billion to over $1 trillion over the past
18 months. <BR>
<BR>
The study, however, does more than cast light on deteriorating consumer
creditworthiness. More worryingly, it exposes a policy shift by lenders
on the guidelines they use to decide who to lend to. They are increasingly
including a borrower's mutual fund holdings when they evaluate whether he
or she has sufficient savings to service the debt. The problem with mutual
fund holdings is that they cannot be liquidated quickly by borrowers to
cover for unemployment and other financial mishaps. <BR>
<BR>
The realization is slowly dawning on MBS issuers and bondholders that guidelines
may have been stretched to drum up business. &quot;In 1994, when rates backed
up, there were very few good borrowers,&quot; says one MBS analyst, &quot;but
lending wasn't curtailed.&quot; The rating agencies agree. &quot;Monsen's
conclusions are valid,&quot; says John Raiter, a managing director at Standard
&amp; Poor's in New York. &quot;We have also observed a relaxation in guidelines
to maintain loan volumes, which makes higher levels of default inevitable.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
It seems that lenders have developed a blindspot. &quot;The presumption
was that all of these loans were underwritten to government-agency standards,&quot;
says Raiter. &quot;But A-quality loans have been made to people behaving
like B-quality borrowers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The MBS market flourished because of support from Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac. These government-sponsored agencies act as intermediaries, purchasing
bank loans and issuing mortgage securities on Wall Street. The Office of
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight has been studying the resilience of
agency-backed mortgages and drawing similar conclusions to Monsen, but investors
remained impassive as the bonds carry government guarantees. <BR>
<BR>
Higher levels of default will feed through to the private-label market -
non-agency backed mortgages - by pushing down bond prices. Mortgage insurance
companies, which enhance the credit quality of MBS issues by providing insurance
&quot;wrappers&quot;, are set to take the biggest hit. &quot;Perhaps now
would be a good time to start shorting mortgage insurers,&quot; says the
MBS analyst. <BR>
<BR>
The home equity-backed securities market should also brace itself for troubled
times ahead. Consumers are using their homes as the major source of collateral
for raising debt, creating a burgeoning market for home equity lending and
a new type of asset-backed security (ABS). But the mounting credit squeeze
could kill the fledgling market. &quot;As mortgage defaults increase, the
loss severity on home equity loans is almost 100%,&quot; says Monsen. <BR>
<BR>
Consumers have been lured into a credit spiral by refinancing credit card
bills using their homes as collateral. Lenders have been drumming up business
by sending out mailers to people with big credit card bills, offering to
refinance the bills, carrying interest rates of 12%-18%, with home equity
loans at rates of 8%-10%. <BR>
<BR>
But house prices have remained stagnant or fallen in most parts of the country,
which means the value of a house may not to be enough to raise a loan. Lenders
have accepted appraisals overvaluing houses to maintain volumes of business.The
home-equity loan sector, which generated $12 billion in ABS issues in 1995
- out of a total of $430 billion - already had its sceptics among investors.
&quot;Home-equity securities are unappealing because they lump together
a spectrum of investment types - from A-quality loans to more risky B and
C investments,&quot; says Paul Ullman, co-manager of the mortgage securities
portfolio of Alliance Capital Management. &quot;Given that range, it's difficult
to get a handle on the risks. That's why we've stayed away.&quot;  <B>Ronan

<H4>SPAIN </H4>
<H3>Will Popular buy BCH? </H3>
The David and Goliath story is being re-enacted in the Spanish banking world
with Banco Popular - the smallest but most profitable of the big five banks
- setting its sights on a much larger takeover candidate, which the market
believes could be the stumbling giant Banco Central Hispano (BCH). <BR>
<BR>
Banco Popular fired the first warning shots after the announcement of its
results in January, when its chairman, Luis Valls, said he did not rule
out the possibility of acquiring or merging with another bank. At the same
time, Banco Popular's general secretary, Manuel Mart&iacute;n, said that,
in addition to its Pta200 billion ($1.6 billion) in free capital, the bank
could raise another Pta400 billion &quot;within 24 hours&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We realized in January that we needed to assure long-term growth to
offset tighter margins that would affect the entire banking system,&quot;
says Mart&iacute;n. &quot;This implied a shift in strategy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Not that the bank is under any immediate pressure to embark on a radical
shake-up. Last year's results showed that its niche business - as a medium-sized
provider of retail services and corporate lending, with a focus on the Spanish
hinterland - remains a valid strategy. Banco Popular's pretax profit as
a percentage of total assets was 2.94%, about four times that of its closest
rival. Return on equity, at 21.42%, was well ahead of the industry average,
but reflected the sector's steady decline over the past five years. The
bank's ROE has often exceeded 25% in the past decade. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the short term we will meet margin pressure by expanding our customer
base and scaling down unproductive assets,&quot; says Mart&iacute;n. &quot;In
the longer term we do not rule out taking advantage of any worthwhile opportunity,
including an acquisition.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But Mart&iacute;n stresses that any takeover or merger must comply with
two preconditions: it must not dilute the bank's level of profitability
and Banco Popular's management must remain in control of the enlarged group.
<BR>
<BR>
This view is echoed by Valls, who says: &quot;Size is important but we are
not going to leap into anything blindly. We would only go this route if
it were good for our shareholders, customers and employees. All mergers
are characterized by two factors, price and fear. We have never been motivated
by the fear of being a takeover candidate ourselves and we have never entertained
any doubts about the correctness of our future management strategy.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Banco Popular has considered acquisitions on several occasions in the past
few years. It failed to agree a price on Banco Herrero, which eventually
went to the Catalan savings bank La Caixa and, in 1994, was on the verge
of joining in the battle for Banesto, the collapsed bank that was eventually
taken over by Banco Santander. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Banco Popular cannot carry on for ever growing its loan book faster
than its deposit base,&quot; says Jos&eacute; Sevilla, head of research
at Spanish broker FG Inversiones. &quot;The two alternatives are to acquire
another bank or continue to expand the client base. But the second option
implies cutting charges to clients and a deterioration in profitability,
which is contrary to the bank's philosophy. If they go for an acquisition,
there is not much to be gained by taking over a small or medium-sized bank.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The choice of large candidates is limited to four. But of these, any bid
for Banco Santander, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya or Argentaria (which is still
nearly 50% state-owned) would have to be launched on a hostile basis - an
option which Banco Popular has ruled out and which would incur the Bank
of Spain's wrath. The three are highly profitable banks with no obvious
benefits to be gained from a merger with Banco Popular. <BR>
<BR>
That leaves BCH, a cumbersome merger of two ailing giants put together in
1991 during the depths of Spain's recession. The appointment of Angel Corc&oacute;stegui
- one of the bright sparks of Spanish banking - as chief executive has done
little to shake the old-style board out of its lethargy, as is reflected
in the bank's results. Its 8.6% capital adequacy ratio is the sector's lowest,
the bank is lumbered with Pta185 billion of zero-yielding assets and, last
year, it had to set aside Pta95 billion in provisions for bad and doubtful
debts. BCH's Pta25.6 billion pre-tax profit just managed to cover its dividend
payout. &quot;This should be a crucial year of transition for BCH, but the
board will never give Corc&oacute;stegui the free rein he needs to restructure
the bank,&quot; says a Madrid analyst. <BR>
<BR>
Enter Banco Popular? <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Given the precedent of Banesto, it is unlikely that Banco Popular
would go for BCH unless it had assurances of a similar government bail-out
of BCH's bad and doubtful debt portfolio and a significant shrinkage of
its industrial portfolio,&quot; says Mariano Colmenar, banking analyst at
BZW in Madrid. BCH's industrial group, which contains a number of profitable
companies, accounts for about 20% of the group's total Pta500 billion book
value. Banco Popular's Mart&iacute;n says that, in its present state, BCH
would excessively dilute the group's profitability. <BR>
<BR>
Banco Popular is confident it could extend its successful tight management
methods to an enlarged group but it knows that, in the short term, its share
price would take a hammering after any major acquisition. Hence the bank's
almost obsessive concern to ensure long-term shareholder value, a key factor
for foreign investors who hold 54% of Banco Popular's equity - the highest
proportion of foreign investment in any Spanish bank. <BR>
<BR>
With Spanish markets still reeling from the March 3 general election, which
put an end to almost 14 years of socialist rule but failed to provide the
Popular Party with a clear majority, major corporate activity is unlikely
to happen over the next few months. &quot;Politicians as well as the Bank
of Spain are taking an interest in the future of BCH, but any decisive move
involving state aid is going to be difficult to achieve given the government's
current weakness,&quot; says Sevilla <BR>
at FG Inversiones.  <B>Jules Stewart<BR>

<H4>EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK </H4>
<H3>Karsenti's first year </H3>
The first thing the new director general of finance did when he arrived
at the European Investment Bank almost a year ago was to ask his four division
chiefs about their strategic approach to markets. Barbara Steuer, who covers
Germany, Switzerland and Austria, and who had joined only a few months earlier
from CS First Boston, replied that she favoured a flexible approach that
might involve large, negotiated benchmark transactions. <BR>
<BR>
This was the answer Ren&eacute; Karsenti was looking for. His predecessor,
Philippe Marchat, who had been in charge for 13 years, was less flexible.
He liked competitive bidding. As a result, the EIB had an aggressive reputation
in the market. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;One of my objectives,&quot; says Karsenti, &quot;is to communicate
even better with investors. I want them to say, 'With the EIB, the issues
are correctly priced and well handled afterwards'. That is the image we
must continue to develop. We have excellent placement with European retail,
but we must strengthen our appeal in the institutional world.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In this respect Karsenti's debut did not disappoint. Last July, the EIB
launched its first-ever negotiated deal, a successful Dm1.5 billion five-year
bond, lead managed by Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, launched
at a spread that was almost certainly tighter than a competitive bid would
have achieved. <BR>
<BR>
Banks prefer negotiated deals because they use a price-discovery process
which means, theoretically, that the deal's spread should not widen and
the lead managers should not be left with bonds on their books. This contrasts
with competitive bidding where banks bid - sometimes suicidally - for a
mandate that leaves them with overpriced bonds they are unable to sell -
sometimes for months. <BR>
<BR>
A new mentality is gradually emerging at the EIB, say lead managers, characterized
by a greater responsiveness to ideas, and a greater sense of market responsibility.
&quot;There is much more face-to-face contact,&quot; says one banker. &quot;And,
even if they do have a competitive bidding, there is much more conversation.
They don't want to do deals that don't work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In the first three months of 1996, the EIB has raised Ecu6.2 billion ($7.75
billion) in 14 different currencies. But the bank has a long way to go,
since it expects to raise between Ecu16 billion and Ecu18 billion this year.
Karsenti's strategy is to do two-thirds of its issuance as large liquid
benchmarks, a third as opportunistic, retail-targeted deals and the remainder
as structured deals off the still to-be launched Euro-MTN programme. <BR>
<BR>
So far this year the EIB has issued benchmarks in sterling, guilders, French
francs and Ecu. But, of these, only the &#163;400 million ($621 million)
sterling issue used the price-discovery process. This was all the more remarkable
given that sterling borrowing is the responsibility of Jean-Claude Bresson
- and the deputy director of capital markets is the closest thing in Luxembourg
to a Marchat prot&eacute;g&eacute;. <BR>
<BR>
Karsenti is quick to quell any suggestions of dissent, however, and points
to the funding strategy submitted to the board in January. He says the paper
represents the views of all his senior colleagues. &quot;I will not hide
the fact that at the beginning there were naturally some 'show me first'
type questions,&quot; he says, indicating that there aren't any now. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Mr Karsenti's predecessor followed the more traditional school,&quot;
says Ulrich Damm, the director of capital markets and 10 years at the EIB.
&quot;The emphasis of our activity is now on institutional investors.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The move towards benchmarks has a simple objective. &quot;He wants to be
the premier non-domestic borrower in all European markets,&quot; says one.
<BR>
<BR>
Karsenti's vision of the EIB is heavily associated with Europe. &quot;I
think there is a real political will in Europe for European monetary union
to happen in time,&quot; he says. And as he well knows, this has important
consequences for the EIB. <BR>
<BR>
Karsenti estimates that 80%-90% of the EIB's funds - after swaps - are borrowed
in European currencies. This means that at least Ecu10 billion (or, rather,
Euro10 billion) will be raised in the new single currency after monetary
union. That figure would rise depending on how many countries join. &quot;Over
that time I want to consolidate the EIB as the leading complement to European
government bonds.&quot; The EIB might even have primary dealers, he thinks.
<BR>
<BR>
This underpins the strategic changes Karsenti is making. &quot;We cannot
raise Ecu18 billion in opportunistic deals. We must use benchmarks,&quot;
he says. By the time of monetary union he will already have set up a yield
curve in all the currencies that will join the first stage of EMU: Deutschmarks,
guilders and French francs. He is also talking of issuing a dollar global
- an instrument he helped to invent when at the World Bank, but that Marchat
disparagingly called a &quot;semantic&quot; exercise. Should he do so, his
posse of devotees will probably triple overnight. <BR>
<BR>
With Karsenti's first anniversary approaching, most bankers give him full
marks for his performance, even if this has been a touch less dashing this
year than last. But many also suspect that the old spirit lurks beneath
the new investor-friendly face of the bank, and that Karsenti is not always
in harmony with some of his staff. (Karsenti can't fire his internal opponents
because the EIB's employment practices are those of a government organization.)
<BR>
<BR>
As a sign that Karsenti's strategy is slipping, bankers point to a Dm1 billion
bought deal in mid-January. &quot;We were sorry,&quot; reacted one banker.
&quot;It was a step back in disciplined market behaviour. I blame it on
the league tables.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Despite its size, this was a purely opportunistic trade, and not a benchmark
issue. It was apparently targeted at Swiss retail investors, which explained
the presence of CS First Boston and UBS as lead managers. But observers
note that Salomon Brothers - another of the leads along with West LB - is
not a retail house and that Far East institutions were invited to buy bonds.
This was not, therefore, simply a retail-targeted deal. <BR>
<BR>
The decision to bundle four lead managers together - because they submitted
&quot;identical proposals&quot;, says the EIB - was also a recipe for trouble.
This formula rarely works in volatile markets, since each lead manager is
tempted to sell bonds back to the others via the brokers. In the absence
of a syndicate, this explains why the bonds widened from 20 basis points
over the Bobl (five-year German government bond) to about 26bp over. <BR>
<BR>
Karsenti recognizes that there are legitimate concerns about the transaction.
&quot;Are we sending out the wrong signals?&quot; he asks. But he believes
not. &quot;For large benchmarks, negotiated pricing is the best way to issue.
But I am not giving up other techniques. In this issue we had the opportunity
of a targeted deal which complements the benchmark.&quot; He thought the
structure, with four lead managers, sent out a clear signal that this was
not a benchmark. &quot;We did have a long debate, particularly on the issue's
size,&quot; he says. &quot;Will we do it again? Yes. It was mainly targeted
to a specific group of investors.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
However, in its most recent retail-targeted Deutschmark issue, the size
was more modest. The Dm300 million issue launched at the end of March was
altogether less confusing, its size more in keeping with expectations.&quot;The
fact that they did that deal,&quot; says one banker, &quot;underlines their
strategy. The world isn't black or white. There's lots of grey areas.&quot;

<H4>EMERGING CURRENCY EUROBONDS </H4>
<H3>What a lot of zloties </H3>
The opening of zloty-linked and zloty-denominated international bond markets
suggests that Poland might replace the Czech Republic as the standard-bearer
for eastern and central Europe in the capital markets. <BR>
<BR>
Until recently, fixed-income investors looking to gain exposure to the appreciating
zloty have been largely limited to Polish government bond markets. Polish
T-bill yields have been as high as 24% in recent months, but convertibility,
settlement and credit risk have deterred many international investors. <BR>
<BR>
In late January the EBRD offered $30 million of dollar-denominated one-year
bonds carrying a 20.5% coupon payable in dollars but with the overall return
linked to the performance of the zloty. The proceeds of the deal were swapped
into floating-rate dollars. <BR>
<BR>
According to syndicate officials at the deal's lead manager, Chemical Investment
Bank, assuming a stable zloty/dollar exchange rate performance from the
launch date, the deal offered an effective yield of some 20.62% over its
one-year tenor. Although the transaction offered no protection on the principal
should the zloty fall in value, the high interest rate carried by the deal
would nevertheless still guarantee investors a healthy return. In Chemical's
worst-case scenario, were the zloty to fall by 10.5% in value versus the
dollar this year, the issue would yield 10.12%. This still represents a
significantly higher level of return to investors compared with those offered
by plain-vanilla dollar issues and is in line with the yields on Czech koruna-denominated
Eurobonds, the only east European currency in which Eurobonds have been
issued. <BR>
<BR>
The deal shows the level of demand for exposure to Poland's economic boom.
Estimates for economic growth this year are 5.5%, after 6.5% last year,
with annual inflation forecast at 18%-20%, down from the nightmare level
of 447% in 1990. Since 1991, the National Bank of Poland has devalued the
currency through a crawling peg. But heavy foreign currency inflows meant
that the zloty appreciated by 3%, last December. <BR>
<BR>
In February, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) inaugurated the
Euro-zloty bond market when it offered Z100 million of two-year bonds with
a 18.5% coupon via JP Morgan Securities. Unlike the dollar-denominated but
zloty-linked deals, the IFC's zloty bond carries convertibility risk, but
JP Morgan calculates that the zloty would have to fall to Z3.50 to the dollar
from its current level of about Z2.50 before international investors would
be out of the money. <BR>
<BR>
The deal also offered investors the chance to lock in current Polish interest
rates for two years at a time when Polish rates are falling. Richard Luddington,
vice president at JP Morgan, says: &quot;Market sentiment towards the issue
was definitely improved by Moody's upgrading of Polish Brady bonds to Baa3
investment grade. The deal also benefited from investors switching out of
Euro-rand and Euro-koruna bonds.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In a near carbon copy of the IFC deal, GECC offered Z100 million of two-year
bonds in a deal once again lead-managed by JP Morgan Securities. GECC's
transaction carried a 18.25% coupon, some 25bp tighter than the IFC's issue
the previous week. Luddington says: &quot;The pricing on the GECC issue
simply reflected both falling yields in the Polish T-bill market and the
strength of investor demand we have identified for this product.&quot; Although
the zloty is not yet convertible and Euro-zloty bonds carry restrictions
requiring all flows to be managed in US dollars, international investors
will diversify into this new sector out of other high-yield markets for
as long as strong Polish economic data offers hope for zloty appreciation.

<BR>
The sector received a boost in March when Ford Credit Europe announced a
Z200 million commercial paper programme. <B>Guy Norton<BR>

<H3>EDITORIAL</H3>
<H2>A star in the east - or west </H2>
You could call it the end-of-a-bumper-year phenomenon. <BR>
<BR>
Institutional investors during November suddenly stopped investing. Most
have produced such good results this year that they have no need for further
returns, and they are scared of giving back any of the money they have made
so far. Indeed, this has been a year when it was very hard not to make excellent
returns. Since the start of 1996, the Morgan Stanley Capital International
index (covering 22 major stock markets) is up 15.7% in dollar terms. Fixed-income
investors should have done almost as well. Yields on long-term bonds in
all major countries have fallen considerably over the past 12 months. <BR>
<BR>
The investment slow-down has affected the new-issue markets over the past
few weeks. Eurobond issuance has been almost entirely limited to retail-targeted
deals - particularly to Japan. Privatization issues have generally struggled
to find investment demand. Two blue-chip offerings - for Italy's Eni and
Indonesia's PT Telkom - had to be considerably scaled back to make them
work. <BR>
<BR>
Some investment bankers have concluded from this that 1996 will be a difficult
year for equity issues. They fret that institutional investors have become
fed up with buying privatization stocks - particularly telecoms - and that
next year's headline-making sell-offs, including Deutsche Telekom and Italy's
Stet, will be hard to get away. On the bond new issues side, the bankers
worry that the volume of deals could shrink too. The borrowing requirements
of European countries continue to fall as they bring their budget deficits
under control. The corporate sector shows little promise: companies are
still reluctant to borrow because many are cash-rich and almost all predict
an economic slowdown in Europe and the US. In addition, international investors
remain wary of buying corporate debt. Unlike their American counterparts,
most are unsoph-isticated when it comes to judging credit risk and evaluating
hybrid instruments, such as preferred stock, which corporates like to issue.
<BR>
<BR>
The saviour of the financial world in 1996 - which many investment bankers
have missed - could be the emerging markets. Investors in emerging markets
have, in general, had a lousy year in 1995. Of the top 24 emerging stock
markets, only eight have produced positive returns (in dollar terms) in
the first 11 months of this year. And many of the winners - Venezuela and
China, for example - rose only because they fell so far in 1994. Some of
the institutions' previous favourite markets have produced dismal results:
the Czech Republic is down 17%, Mexico down 29% and Taiwan down 36%. <BR>
<BR>
But fund managers, surprisingly enough, have not been put off. Despite the
recent ups and downs, many still believe in the fundamental arguments in
favour of investing (over the long term) in emerging markets. A revealing
poll in this issue of <I>Euromoney</I>  suggests that investment will continue
to flow into emerging markets next year, in particular into Latin America.
<I>Euromoney</I> received replies from 86 fund managers, with $865 billion
under management, detailing their investment plans for 1996. Only one investor
said he planned to reduce his exposure to emerging markets; 70% said they
would increase exposure. <BR>
<BR>
Paradoxically, the Mexican crisis last December and January has made investors
feel more comfortable about putting their money in Latin America. Despite
the pressure on the region's leaders - especially in Argentina, Mexico and
Brazil - to back-track on their tough stabilization programmes, none has
done so. Indeed, Brazil's Fernando Enrique Cardoso won the presidential
election at the end of last year almost entirely because of his success
in conquering inflation. Suddenly, painful economic measures have become
electorally popular. <BR>
<BR>
Investors' second reason for liking emerging markets is that they look cheap
by comparison with other asset classes. US and European stock markets appear
vastly over-valued by most conventional measures. Even the Japanese stock
market - despite its five years of stagnation - still looks expensive by
western yard-sticks: the average price/earnings ratio (based on forecast
earnings) is almost 60. Interest rates are close to historical lows in most
developed countries. That is one reason why retail investors - in Japan
and Germany especially - are becoming important players in international
capital markets. Investing in Lithuanian Eurodollar bonds at 10% (to take
one deal rumoured to come to the market in December) looks attractive for
Japanese investors who receive less than 1% for similar-maturity instruments
in yen. <BR>
<BR>
The risks are high, though. Emerging markets have proved themselves particularly
fragile over the past two years. They are vulnerable both to internal shocks
(political upheaval, for example) and external ones (movements in US interest
rates, say). The last week of November demonstrated their volatility. In
five days, the Turkish stock market fell 11.1%; at the same time, the Mexican
market was up 6.8% and the Philippine market 6.2%. <p>

<H3>FINLAND</H3>



<H2> <B>Single currency, double whammy</B> </H2> 

<H4>
<B>Finland's membership of the EU's exchange rate mechanism looks imminent and
the country will be well placed to join monetary union. But Finnish banks, just
coming out of recession, will need to cut costs and probably merge to keep their
heads above water in the new, more competitive environment. John McGrath
reports</B> </H4> 

<P> On September 16, Finland's prime minister, Paavo Lipponen,
said his country would soon join the EU's exchange rate mechanism (ERM). He would
not specify a date. Other ministers have been equally reticent, both in public
and private. Speculation has already taken the likely entry date through to this
month and it's looking as if the move will come after the European parliament
elections on October 12. Juha Ahtola, chief economist at Merita Bank, dismisses
the date game as distracting: "The important thing is that Finland will be
joining and the markets have taken this on board. Picking the day is politics."

<P> When Finland does join the ERM it will be better placed than most of the
neighbouring EU members to qualify for European monetary union (EMU) if, as seems
likely, a decision is made to go ahead with this in 1998. Finland will by then
have had close to two years' ERM membership. Its interest rates are low enough to
satisfy the convergence criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty. Its debt/GDP
ratio is only just above the 60% limit and, according to economists at Finland's
leading banks and the finance ministry, will be below it by 1999. Only the OECD
(in a country report published in August) has poured cold water on the notion
that Finland will meet the targets for monetary union.

<P> For at least one banker Finland's strong position is no accident. "The
single-currency question in Finland is not the same as in London or Copenhagen or
Stockholm. Finland does not have a choice to make about whether or not the single
currency is a good thing or a bad thing at a theoretical level," he says,
"Finland's choice is different. The Finnish government is saying: 'There is going
to be a single currency. Given that fact should Finland be in or out?' There is
only one answer to that question."

<P> The questions facing bankers in Finland are also different to those facing
their peers in Frankfurt, London or Paris. The talk in the boardrooms of
Helsinki's financial district is not about the difficulties of creating a
pan-European retail network or necessarily about how much extra floorspace a
trading room will need in order to compete head to head with Deutsche Bank on
Ecu/dollar cross rates. Many leading analysts suggest that the question facing
Finland's banks should be: "How can we survive?"

<P> <B>Unseasonable weather</B>

<P> "Emu will affect Finnish banks like cold snow falling in summer," says a
Helsinki-based banker. At a time when Finnish banks are just gaining confidence
after the debt crisis, Emu could damage their market share. Although not all
Finland's bankers expect a devastating snowstorm, all expect some precipitation.
"Finns are used to snow. We have learnt to cope with it." says Arto Elomaa, the
economist at the Finnish Bankers Association (FBA) who prepared its contribution
to the European Banking Federation study on Emu. "If you look back, we have made
mistakes in the 1980s and have tried hard to overcome them in the 1990s. We will
be ready for monetary union. It may be that our past makes us ready in a
different way to a country where banking has progressed smoothly."

<P> The state of Finnish banking after the recession is the background to this
assertion. At the beginning of 1996 Finnish banks still owed the government over
Fmk6.5 billion ($1.4 billion) for support loans made during the crisis. This year
interest on that amounts to almost Fmk400 million. On top of this, Finnish banks
are still feeling the bite of the recession. GDP fell heavily between 1991 and
1994 and that helped generate a high level of low-yield financial and real
assets. This has kept net interest income below 2% in Finland compared with
around 3% in the other Nordic countries.

<P> Banks are also still waiting to pick up on a feel-good effect generated by
falling interest rates and GDP growth in 1995 and 1996. "Net interest income will
probably stay low for some time now," says Heikki Koskenkyl&auml;, an adviser to
the board of the central bank. "The recession has made companies and households
keenly aware of the dangers of overindebtedness. They have been and still are
wary of new loans."

<P> The relatively high level of markka-denominated loans is another indication
of low confidence among borrowers. Central bank calculations show outstanding
loans in foreign currency totalling Fmk100 billion in 1991. Now the total is
Fmk30 billion. Koskenkyl&auml; says: "Most firms have chosen to pay back
foreign-currency debt because of the weak markka."Although banks are repaying
relief and the number of low-yield assets is falling, these problems still have
an adverse effect on profits. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, many banks reported
strong profits in 1995. Den Danske Bank, for example, made a net profit of
Dkr3.63 billion ($589 million). In Finland the situation is different. Some
Finnish banks returned to profit in 1995, but their profits were weak by
comparison with those of their Nordic rivals. Merita made just Fmk59 million in
1995. But even that is healthy compared with some of its local competitors.
Postipankki Group reported losses of Fmk509 million in the same period.

<P> Banks are doing better this year. Treasury operations have generated good
profits. Central bank figures for deposit banks as a whole show a small operating
loss in 1995 and forecast a small profit in 1996. Some will outperform. Merita,
for example, reported profits of Fmk418 million on its ordinary operations
between April and August.

<P> Even so, banks will have their work cut out to maintain profitability. While
bankers in other countries reduced operating costs in the late 1980s and early
1990s, Finnish banks did not. Those cuts are being made now, with Merita taking
the lead. The bank reduced its staff by over 3,000 between June 1995 and June
1996 and further retrenchments are planned. The half-yearly statement to June
1996 includes a Fmk150 million provision for severance packages relating to 600
agreed redundancies. The cuts are bringing the bank into line with its Nordic
competitors. Merita had over 17,000 staff last year. Svenksa Handelsbanken, a
larger Swedish bank with similar operations, has only 12,000. The cuts are
contributing to a drop in operating costs. The January-June figure for 1996 is
Fmk3.3 billion, down more than Fmk200 million on the combined total for the
corresponding period last year of the Union Bank of Finland and Kansallis Osake
Pankki groups which merged to form Merita.

<P> Those banks that have downsized may find the savings are similar to the costs
of preparing systems and staff for Emu. The initial FBA estimate put the cost of
Emu at around Fmk1 billion. Most of this will be expended on new information
technology (IT) systems and re-educating staff. The FBA's Elomaa believes the
estimate is on the high side. The actual cost of preparation is likely to be
lower. Merita, which holds over 40% of Finnish retail deposits, roughly estimates
its likely costs at Fmk200 million. When pressed, Elomaa puts the likely overall
figure at between Fmk500 million and Fmk700 million. However the FBA will not
issue authoritative new figures until the banks have completed their own detailed
internal assessments. At the major banks these will not be ready until the new
year.

<P> The central bank's Koskenkyl&auml; is also wary of high estimates. "Much of
this money will have to be spent on updating systems whether or not there is
Emu," he says. Elomaa reckons that Finns' willingness to spend on technologically
advanced systems is already  holding down costs and will give Finns a competitive
edge when Emu is instituted. Among the innovations mentioned is the Avant card, a
cashless payment card to be launched in 1997. Remote-access banking is another
area where Finnish banks are hoping to be at the forefront, although when
Koskenkyl&auml; looks for an example of a good system he points to Swedbank's
experiment with Internet-based share trading.

<P> Some bankers are tempted to seek to limit these costs by asking for
compensation from the state. Kaija Erjanti at the FBA says there have been no
formal discussions between the association and the government on this. However,
the association has not ruled out the possibility. Rauno Niinim&auml;ki, who
heads the Emu project at the finance ministry, thinks this could lead to demands
from other sectors. "Costs will spiral," he says, "if the banks ask for and are
paid compensation then industry will say to us: 'Emu is expensive for us too, why
don't we get compensation.' If we pay them too then the public will want
something."

<P> <B>Even tighter margins</B>

<P> Mergers could help limit staff training costs and systems upgrades. Merita's
experience is encouraging. Pre-merger estimates prepared by Kansallis Osake
Pankki and Union Bank of Finland show that Emu would have cost the banks almost
double what Emu will cost the merged bank. Pertti Voutilainen, president of
Merita Bank, explains the circumstances that led to the savings: "As far as
technology and machines are concerned both banks are very much up to date. The
adjustment to the new payment system and new common currency is very much a human
capital investment and not a physical capital investment. In that sense one plus
one would have been very close to two."

<P> Systems updates and savings on group expenses will not, however, be the most
important factors determining post-Emu market share.  Emu will have a serious
adverse effect on most key areas of business. Voutilainen says: "At first Emu is
bound to have a negative effect on the balance book." With the markka gone,
Finnish banks will no longer have a monopoly on providing essential services to
Finnish customers. For example, Finnish markka lending will be replaced by
lending denominated in euros.

<P> Keith Baird, banking analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London, says: "The larger
European banks will be able to make economies of scale that are not open to the
smaller banks and so will be able to offer tighter margins." Kari Mannola,
managing director at Banque Indosuez in Helsinki, says: "A similar process has
already occurred with lending to large corporations. These companies request
rates from global banks. Margins are the finest on the market. Emu will allow a
similar competitive situation to develop with regard to loans for more
medium-sized corporations and maybe household and personal loans in situations
where excessive pricing is practised."

<P> Elomaa believes, though, that Finnish banks are capable of coping with low
margins since interest rate margins in Finland are already relatively thin. The
central bank's Koskenkyl&auml; says: "If you look at the gap between the average
deposit rate and the average loan rate, Norway has the narrowest margin at just
3.5%. The margin in Finland is around 4.2%." It is tighter still in some areas.
Both Baird and Elomaa estimate the margins across the corporate sector to be
between 1% and 2%. All of those contacted expect there to be further tightening.
Elomaa is cautiously optimistic about this trend. "It may mean that Finnish banks
will be able to take advantage of the euro loan market at the expense of banks
that have traditionally operated in countries with high margins," he says.

<P> Other market participants are less sanguine, concluding that Finnish banks
will quickly be squeezed into offering negative margins if the bulge-bracket
banks decide to offer low rates on euro-denominated loans to a wide customer base
in Finland. With assets close to $460 billion, Deutsche Bank has nearly eight
times the asset base of Merita, Finland's largest bank. Merita itself has almost
double the asset base of its nearest Finnish competitors, Postipankki and
Okobank. Finland's banks clearly risk being outgunned.

<P> The demise of the markka also threatens to snuff out treasury operations.
Ilkka Salonen, an analyst at Postipankki, expects the loss of markka-based forex
trading to cost about $500 million a year. Ari M&auml;kinen, economist at
Handelsbanken Markets in Helsinki, says: "If we exclude Swedish krona and US
dollars, 70% of Finnish foreign trade will be done in euro currencies. That will
have an impact on earnings." Income will be lost both from currency operations
and payment transfer fees.

<P> Niinim&auml;ki's team at the finance ministry has already begun to prepare a
timetable for the state to begin issuing euro-denominated bonds from the
beginning of 1999. "Once this happens," says Salonen, "Finnish banks will cease
to be market-makers for Finnish bonds. Banks will still be trading bonds and the
government will continue to issue, but they will have lost their dominant
position as Finnish markka traders that gives them the edge in the local bond
market." There will be new markets to focus on but the important question is
whether Finnish banks are well positioned to dominate those markets.

<P> Few in the Finnish markets feel that local banks can hold on to a large share
of this sort of business. "It will go. we are aware of that," says Voutilainen.
"The loss will not devastate us." M&auml;kinen says: "There is not really very
much that the local banks can do to keep this business." As one trader in
Helsinki puts it: "Who is going to call a Finnish bank for euro/dollar
cross-rates when they can talk to Merrill Lynch or Citibank in London at the
touch of a button. Now it is worth calling Finnish banks because they are ahead
of the market in Finland and they can give the best quotes. But they will not be
able to do so in London."

<P> Representatives of some global banks confirm that they plan to take advantage
of this market shift. Stephen McClintlock, managing director of Citibank in
Helsinki, says: "Monetary union could be a very strong revenue generator for
global banks." The sort of services that might be offered include global cash
management services and currency dealing services.

<P> To an extent Finland's largest retail banks are not too concerned about such
developments since a large amount of high-level corporate business is already
done abroad. Indeed most top-tier companies are already represented by foreign
bankers on major projects. Thus the consortia bidding for the government's first
private-finance contract, for the construction of a road between Helsinki and the
lake district town of Lahti, are represented by foreign banks that include
Hambros, NatWest and BZW and a number of local banks.

<P> Moreover, even though this business goes to foreign banks it alone will not
encourage more to open in Helsinki. Anneli Brummer, vice-president of the
financial institutions group at Citibank Helsinki, says: "The single currency is
unlikely to influence or encourage further new foreign bank entrants.  Since
foreign banks first opened here in 1982, every year there is a rumour that this
bank or that bank is coming. Very few have actually <BR> done so."

<P> The fact that the sort of wholesale operations Citibank's Helsinki office is
offering to local banks can be done just as well remotely is a deterrent to other
global banks exploring this market. Another is the low returns available in
Finland on this kind of niche business. Bjorn Undin, senior vice-president of the
Nordic countries banking group at Svenska Handelsbanken's head office in
Stockholm, explains: "When you open in a new country your first target  is
corporate business. It is only after this operation is established that a bank
can begin to think about winning other business."

<P> Despite the low returns, some Nordic banks have risked opening Helsinki
offices targeted at niche corporate business. Such banks want more than a toehold
for providing  wholesale treasury operations or advising on complex international
transactions. Their long-term plan is to offer the same universal service across
the region. Svenska Handelsbanken moved in first, then Enskilda. Den Danske Bank
is the latest.

<P> Handelsbanken, which plans to move in and poach business Finnish bankers
regard as their own, poses a bigger problem than the global banks. Those, like
the FBA's Elomaa, who think home-bred Finnish banks will weather Emu well see
their strength deriving from the depth and breadth of local knowledge that can
only be acquired by a bank that has a locally staffed universal operation.
Salonen indicates the sort of operations that help to build such knowledge when
he points to large-scale retail banking and domination of the small corporate and
household markets as characteristic strengths of Finland's universal banks that
will survive Emu. He also suggests that private banking and asset management will
be growth areas.

<P> <B>Determined to grow</B>

<P> Handelsbanken is the only foreign bank now trying to compete with Finnish
banks on any of these fronts. The bank has been in Finland since 1989. It began
by operating a corporate banking office in Helsinki but now has 10 branches and
wants to challenge for market share in retail banking. The bank bought the
healthy 40% of Skopbank in 1995. The purchase price of Fmk585 million was high
but the acquisition has boosted Handelsbanken's Finnish assets to Fmk25 billion,
making it the fourth-largest bank in Finland by assets. Undin says that although
the bank is "consolidating" its position at the moment, there will be further
growth.

<P> "Handelsbanken is determined to grow," says one banker. "It can really only
take market share from the big three Finnish banks." Voutilainen cuts down such
talk down to size by pointing to Bank of Finland statistics: "Look at retail
deposits. The three largest Finnish banks between them have over 95% of the
market. Handelsbanken has 10 branches, we have several hundred. It is not
worrying us at the moment. Who knows what the position will be in five or 10
years' time?"

<P> Others consider that Handelsbanken's limited business is to its advantage.
The bank likes to offer a personal service to clients and as far as possible
wants branch managers to be able to make all decisions relating to client needs.
Such objectives are easier to meet with a small branch network. Postipankki's
Salonen says: "Until very recently, Finnish banks simply haven't been interested
in, or able to offer, that kind of service. Now banks that can offer high-level
service will be well positioned to hold on to business in 1999." Another banker
points out the difficulties faced by major Finnish banks because of their size:
"They thrive because they offer the same standard of service to everybody. They
can't suddenly have one plush counter for the Countess van Linden and an ordinary
counter for Ilkka Tuonenen, the plumber. When England's National Westminster
wanted to do a similar thing, it had to buy Coutts." However Salonen does believe
his bank will offer a credible personal banking service in the near future and
thinks the other majors are not far behind.

<P> Whether or not this is so, Salonen says Handelsbanken's push into
service-oriented personal banking shows the kind of strategy needed to survive
Emu. "Banks must fight to establish market strengths in areas that will thrive
after Emu and at the same time separate themselves from their competitors," he
says.

<P> To some extent the structure of Finland's largest banks already gives them
just such a clear market share. The full name of Okobank's supervisory company,
Osuuspankkien Oy, can be loosely translated as the association of Finnish
cooperative banks. In fact the bank is an amalgamation of Finland's local
cooperative banks. According to one banker: "The banks are very strong in rural
areas. Their customers are fiercely loyal and are not likely to desert simply
because it finds itself unable to offer services as cheaply as other banks."

<P> Postipankki is still 100% state-owned and at branch level operates as part of
the Finnish postal service. Although the government has made it clear that the
bank will be privatized, this does not imply that a strategic stake will be
offered to the highest bidder. To date Finland's privatization programme has been
cautious, characterized by sales of small stakes in state enterprises to the
public. Cross-holdings between Merita and its largest clients have sometimes led
to suggestions that it is a sort of Finnish Deutsche Bank. How seriously such
suggestions should be taken is debatable, but there is no doubt Merita aims to be
the bank of choice for corporate Finland.

<P> But if banks do not move now to protect it, this market share could be eroded
by the negative effects of Emu before the growth-enhancing effects of lower
interest rates and a wider currency area begin to present new opportunities. "If
Okobank's customers find that it is simply unable to provide the level of service
that they get from another bank, they may well begin to leave," suggests Salonen.
"If Merita is unable to offer the same rates as its international competitors,
corporate Finland may do business with those competitors." Postipankki could be
radically altered by privatization.  The sale of Skopbank occured in a different
context but it clearly showed that the government would break up a non-performing
bank into profitable and unprofitable elements in order to push through a sale.

<P> If such speculation is accurate, the search for Emu-proof new markets could
lead to more mergers and takeovers in Finland.  Building up new strengths and
reinforcing old ones, as well as preparing for the technical impact of Emu is
both expensive and necessary.  The cost savings offered by the right merger make
economic sense. That is why Salonen and others are willing to go on the record as
saying that after Emu there will be one Swedish bank and two Finnish banks doing
retail banking in Finland. They believe changes in wholesale banking may well be
wider and less predictable. "Moreover", says Salonen, "banks will have to act
soon if they want to make maximum savings."

<H2>Citi's night at the opera </H2>
<H4> Edited by Steven Irvine </H4>
Senior Citibankers might be in for something of a shock on May 17. That's
the date the new Glyndebourne opera season starts - and the first performance
of the new production of Handel's <I>Theodora</I>, sponsored by Citibank.
<BR>
<BR>
Citi had enormous success with the last opera it sponsored at Glyndebourne,
an exclusive venue in the English countryside near Brighton. <I>Porgy and
Bess</I> was conducted by Simon Rattle and had an all-black cast including
world-famous bass Willard White. Many regular opera-goers rate it the best
they've ever seen. <BR>
<BR>
This season, Citi was given a choice of two new productions. One was a non-starter:
<I>Lulu</I>, a fairly hard-going, avant-garde opera by Alban Berg. <BR>
<BR>
So that leaves <I>Theodora</I>. If you haven't heard of it, don't worry:
it was last performed in Britain in 1966. In fact, it's not an opera at
all, but an oratorio. And the director is Peter Sellars. <BR>
<BR>
Peter Sellars is the <I>enfant terrible</I> of the business. His 1990 <I>Zauberfl&ouml;te</I>
at Glyndebourne was, according to one buff who's been to every season since
1952, &quot;the worst production ever&quot;. Set in a Los Angeles of grubby
T-shirts, it was seen as a travesty of Glyndebourne's beloved Mozart. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Theodora </I>isn't a much-loved opera: it's all but unknown. But 18th-century
opera does tend to attract fanatics: those who like it tend to be keen on
authenticity. This production is being conducted by an early-music specialist,
William Christie, with the orchestra playing on original instruments. <BR>
<BR>
Peter Sellars, however, certainly won't make many concessions to authenticity.
He will offend a lot of people - he always does. <BR>
<BR>
Citibank says the bank's first priority is to support the arts, and that
this is a &quot;new and exciting&quot; production. It just remains to be
seen what their staff and clients think of it. <B>Felix Salmon</B> <BR>

<H2>New Chase, new office, new clothes </H2>
The new Chase has opened its first office since the Chemical Bank merger
- in Tashkent. For once, it has beaten Citibank to a location, setting up
the first office of a US bank in the capital of the former Soviet republic
of Uzbekistan. <BR>
<BR>
It's not surprising, then, that the cocktail party thrown to celebrate the
opening was a lavish affair held in the grand Museum of Applied Arts. Beneath
the museum's 100-year-old hand-painted dome, guests were entertained with
a mix of western classical music and traditional Uzbek songs. Such was the
stir the opening caused that the television news programme <I>Akhborot</I>
showed footage of the event several times. <BR>
<BR>
No-one was more concerned to show affinity with the local culture than Chase's
head of Europe, Middle East and Africa, Charles Bauccio, who was the bank's
most senior representative. He received the office's accreditation from
the central bank just half an hour before the party. He was also presented
with an Uzbek <I>tun</I>, <I>duppi</I> and <I>belbogh</I> (robe, cap and
belt) which he immediately put on and wore to the party. <BR>
<BR>
As a result, Bauccio's speech won a rapturous round of applause. &quot;People
felt, after he put on the clothes, more comfortable. [It was] like 'I respect
your country, I am one of you',&quot; says Chase's deputy branch manager,
Tokhir Sultanov, who formerly worked for the central bank and is one of
the three locals in an office of four. <BR>
<BR>
The office, which opened 10 days after the merger of the two banks, is centrally
located in the Turab Tula Plaza office block. This is Uzbekistan's international
financial centre, a glistening new building among the grey Stalinist blocks.
It also houses Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development. <BR>
<BR>
It took just three months to open the office, Chase's first in central Asia.
&quot;It shows our commitment to the country and the prospects we think
it has,&quot; says Murat Talayhan, vice-president for central Asia and the
Caucasus. He adds that Chase has completed lots of transactions in Uzbekistan,
for example a $40 million cotton pre-export financing for US commodity trading
company Dunavant. He says there are many more deals in the pipeline. <BR>
<BR>
Uzbekistan, while not as large as neighbouring Kazakhstan (which is as large
as the whole of western Europe), is also rich in minerals and resources,
especially gas. In addition, it has a reputation for respecting legal contracts.
There are 19 EBRD projects under way in the country. <B>Steven Irvine</B>

<H2>http://www.ABN-Amro/overload </H2>
It seems ABN Amro employees have been protecting themselves against misfortune
with chain mail - not the stuff that deflects slings and arrows, but those
insidious chain letters that are these days mostly sent by e-mail. <BR>
<BR>
Eleven ABN Amro employees in the US and the Netherlands in departments including
global clients, structured finance, equity merchant banking and treasury
received a chain e-mail message in early April forwarded either to their
ordinary e-mail boxes or to internal ccMail or Lotus Notes addresses. At
least eight of these people forwarded the demanded 10 copies to other personnel
within the bank. Soon the total number of recipients was over 100; it would
have required only six generations of the message before 40,000 people received
it. But angry systems managers stepped in and via a stiff e-mail message
(what else?) demanded a stop to the whole silly business. The chain letter
appears to have entered the ABN Amro system via someone working in the bank's
Chicago treasury. <BR>
<BR>
Claiming to originate in New England, from an Asian missionary signing herself
Diana Li, the e-mail promises: &quot;You will receive good luck within four
days of receiving this message provided you, in turn, send it on. This is
no joke. You will receive good luck in the mail...send copies to people
you think need good luck...this message must leave your hands in 96 hours.
Please send 10 copies and see what happens.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A source at the bank says an earlier chain e-mail was traced back to an
official in the Amsterdam automation department. &quot;We think we have
stopped this new one. But you cannot be sure unless employees report it
to you.&quot; <B>Nigel Ash</B> <BR>

<H2>David Band </H2>
<B>David Band, chief executive of BZW, died on March 28 at the age of 53.
A colleague writes this tribute.</B> <BR>
<BR>
The son of an Edinburgh surgeon, David Band was educated at Edinburgh Academy,
Rugby and St Edmund Hall, Oxford. He began his career in 1964 with JP Morgan.
<BR>
<BR>
After various posts in London, Band ran the firm's south-east Asian operations
in Singapore in 1976. He was then promoted to head the firm's Paris office
for three years until 1981 when he was posted to New York as senior vice-president.
He returned to London in 1986 and the following year became head of JP Morgan
Securities, heading Morgan's operations in Europe. <BR>
<BR>
Band was recruited to head BZW in 1988, two years after the firm was formed.
In his eight years at BZW, he developed and transformed it from its UK stockbroking
roots into a powerful investment bank. <BR>
<BR>
Befriending all who came within his ambit, Band cared deeply about unifying
the firm by breaking down the parochial barriers between products. He was
someone who let others take the credit, though his was often the industrious
and invisible hand achieving harmony. <BR>
<BR>
A determined fighter and a natural winner, he possessed a deep understanding
of the investment banking business and a clear vision of its future. As
a friend and a leader David Band is greatly missed. <BR>
<BR>
He leaves a wife, Olivia, and two children, Ben and Isabelle. <BR>

<H2>Merrill: not for the athletic </H2>
An ex-Merrill Lynch banker captained Cambridge University to victory in
the boat race <BR>
against Oxford last month. But why did he leave Merrill to go back to university?
<BR>
<BR>
It seems the 15 stone 5lb rower decided he couldn't hack the Merrill diet
of burgers and late-night takeaways, and a regime that kept him in the office
until 11pm most nights. &quot;It was a radical lifestyle change for me,&quot;
laughs Ethan Ayer, the ex-Harvard rower who worked for Merrill's 20-person
structured finance group. &quot;After two years at Merrill I thought I should
move on.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He left Merrill last July. Since then, a diet of pasta and the wholesale
commitment to fitness the boat race demands have helped him lose over 30lb.
Despite this, the Cambridge number five was still the heaviest oarsman in
the race. Celebrating victory afterwards, the 25-year old - who is studying
English literature - had his first alcoholic drink in 10 weeks. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Oxford and Cambridge boat race has been in my mind for over eight
years,&quot; says Ayer, &quot;although I can see that, to many people, what
I have done might appear in career and financial terms a pretty irresponsible
move.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But not in health terms. Mike Normile, head of the structured finance group
at Merrill, was delighted for Ayer. &quot;He came in with a strong interest
in athletics,&quot; he recalls. &quot;And in a short space of time we turned
an athlete into an overweight analyst. It's kind of a badge we wear,&quot;
he jokes. <BR>
<BR>
Cambridge won the four-and-a-quarter mile race on the River Thames very
easily, but the only record broken on the day was again set by Ayer. He
is the tallest man - at six feet eight and three-quarter inches - ever to
row in the annual race. <B>Steven Irvine</B> <BR>

Board of low pay and their licence to kill </H2>
German executives have started to compare their pay with US levels - and
found it wanting. J&uuml;rgen Schrempp, chairman of Daimler-Benz, has taken
the lead by initiating a share-option scheme for the group's 170 top executives
- the board included. <BR>
<BR>
Previously, a percentage of board pay at Daimler was linked to the company's
dividend. Now, strictly in the interests of shareholder value, according
to Schrempp, executive pay will be linked to the share price, which happens
to have rallied this spring, while the dividend has been cancelled altogether.
<BR>
<BR>
A similar scheme has been introduced for Deutsche Bank's top 200 executives
in Germany, perhaps to lessen the hurt of seeing Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
executives in London signing up for million-dollar pay packets. <BR>
<BR>
Serving on the board of a German corporation is not a job anyone can do,
according to the traditionalists. Indeed, the law on joint-stock corporations
lays down a probationary period of two years. <BR>
<BR>
Deutsche Bank's Tessen von Heydebreck has just been named a full member
of the board after the waiting period. In German banker's parlance, he's
been awarded his <I>Jagdschein, </I>which might loosely be translated as
&quot;licence to kill&quot; and is a fair description of how many German
bankers and directors used to regard their authority. <BR>
<BR>
German companies aren't obliged to disclose directors' earnings in detail,
but only to give a total sum for the full board. At Deutsche Bank, for instance,
that suggests an annual salary of Dm1.8 million ($1.18 million) per board
member. <B>Laura Covill</B> <BR>

<H3>FRANCE </H3>
<H2>Breaking the foreign taboo </H2>
<H4>French banks have given up their global ambitions with mere survival
occupying their minds. The task of slimming down and restructuring is made
more difficult by French aversions to job losses and hostile takeovers.
But, like it or not, brash Anglo-American ideas about markets and management
are being taken on board, reports Jonathan Ford </H4>
It is a measure of the crisis gripping France's banking sector that two
of the country's most respected financial institutions, Paribas and Banque
Indosuez, have recently turned to US management consultancy McKinsey to
advise them on restructuring their businesses. &quot;This is breaking a
taboo in a country as anti-American as France,&quot; jokes one investment
banker. &quot;They must have been pretty desperate to take such a step.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Both banks are struggling with low profitability and the costly legacy of
over-ambitious expansion strategies in the 1980s. But their decision to
tackle these problems with restructuring plans designed by American consultants,
stressing such Anglo-Saxon<B> </B>virtues as focus, profitability and management
accountability, is seen as a sign that the ill-health of the financial sector
is finally forcing French bankers to rethink the way they do business. <BR>
<BR>
Last year was another bad year for French banks and this one promises to
be little better. Their profits continue to be low, provisions against bad
loans remain high, rating agencies have been busy lowering their assessments
across the sector and domestic competition is more intense than ever. <BR>
<BR>
Hardly had the 1995 results season got under way at the end of February
when confidence was dealt another blow as Paribas reported a Ffr4 billion
($800 million) loss for the year, far greater than most analysts had anticipated.
The losses arose for a host of familiar reasons - property provisions of
more than Ffr3 billion, a large write-down in the value of the group's 30%
stake in Navigation Mixte (acquired during the late 1980s), and losses at
the investment banking arm caused by poor trading results. This did nothing
to lift the market's gloom. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Downturn prompts changes</B> <BR>
<BR>
Against this stark background, bankers are beginning to accept that they
can no longer wait for an upturn in the economy to bail them out. &quot;People
are starting to realize that even the largest banks in France &shyp; the
universal banks like Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale and Banque
Nationale de Paris (BNP) &shyp; shouldn't try to do the same job and cater
for the same customers,&quot; says Jean Jacques Ogier, director in charge
of corporate planning at Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale. &quot;There
is room for differences in focus, and for different strategies.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Focus was the key to the Banque Indosuez restructuring plan announced at
the end of January. It involved the closure of offices in 15 countries,
including commercial banking operations in the US &shyp; something of a
departure from the bank's traditionally expansionist approach. &quot;I think
this represented an admission that they could not compete with the global
players like the Anglo-German investment banks in London and the American
bulge-bracket firms,&quot; says one analyst. Instead, Indosuez announced
a new, more modest objective &shyp; that of becoming a leading integrated
investment bank in France, the Middle East and Asia. <BR>
<BR>
Other banks are toying with similar ideas. At Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale,
the poor profitability of the group's retail banking operations is forcing
it to concentrate on building up its capital markets and investment banking
operations. &quot;We are looking at business lines where we have a competitive
advantage,&quot; says Ogier, citing FIMAT, the group's futures broking operations
as well as its derivatives business. Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
is also looking to develop organically its presence in investment banking.
&quot;We have tried to build this up over the last few years, but we aren't
ready for a sudden evolution like an acquisition,&quot; he says. Hence the
bank took no interest in the merchant bank auctions going on in London last
summer. <BR>
<BR>
There are also implications for the retail-banking business. &quot;If conditions
continue to deteriorate,&quot; warns Ogier, &quot;we may become convinced
that there is no future in retail banking for an institution like Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale. This would be a thunderbolt decision. But you can't
exclude it. Maybe not tomorrow, but in the future it could happen.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
French bankers are being forced to contemplate dramatic changes of direction
because of the persistent downturn in their domestic market. The sector's
ills, one banker says, are akin to a bout of flu that the sufferer finds
impossible to shake off. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the problems are cyclical. Mounting corporate losses during France's
long recession, increasing numbers of client companies going bust, and falling
demand for consumer-credit, have conspired to drive down their profitability.
These woes have been compounded by downturns in capital market activities
around the world. <BR>
<BR>
There has also been the banks' heavy involvement in real-estate development,
much of it conceived during the economic boom at the end of the 1980s. Even
today, while there are faint signs that the French housing market may be
recovering &shyp; partly boosted by zero-interest loans introduced by the
government in recent months &shyp; there is no sign of any corresponding
turnround in commercial property. Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's recently
estimated that the banks' unrealized losses on property could still be as
high as Ffr200 billion. <BR>
<BR>
There are also the high-profile problem loans, such as those to Eurotunnel,
the Channel tunnel operator. In October, the company exercised its right
to suspend interest payments on its Ffr60 billion of junior debt, more than
a quarter of which was held by French banks, thus triggering a further round
of provisions. <BR>
<BR>
There seems to be no end to this cycle of woe. The most recent signs suggest
that recovery is still some way off. Economic indicators point to a renewed
slowdown in consumer spending, while anecdotal evidence shows low public
expectation of any upturn in the economy. Most observers agree that things
were not helped by the wave of strikes in the public sector over the Christmas
period. &quot;People in France are still frightened of debt,&quot; says
Michelle Debonneuil, chief economist at Banque Indosuez. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Curbed privileges </B><BR>
<BR>
In the retail sector, the main response has been intensifying competition,
and fierce fighting over interest rates. Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Cr&eacute;dit
Lyonnais, felt justified last summer in complaining about the activities
of some banks, notably France's mutual and savings banks, which he said
were undermining the profitability of the sector by offering uneconomic
loans. <BR>
<BR>
The effect can be seen in the return on equity achieved by the country's
leading retail banks. Even Cr&eacute;dit Commercial de France (CCF), regarded
as the country's best big bank because of its limited exposure to property,
struggles to achieve a return on equity of 10%, half the level achieved
by the UK's leading banks. As one analyst puts it: &quot;The biggest problem
for retail banks is one of revenue. Costs are certainly a problem, too,
but the main problem is a lack of revenue.&quot; This assessment is borne
out by figures produced by the Association of French Banks, the trade association
representing most of the country's retail and commercial banks. In 1994,
the association's members' total revenues fell for the first time in 50
years &shyp; down 5.5% to Ffr238 billion. In the same year, they reported
losses between them of more than Ffr12 billion. <BR>
<BR>
In corporate banking, the situation is little better. Corporate credit demand
has been shrinking since 1992, having grown at a rate of 16% per annum over
the five preceding years, while new equity issue activity has been tailing
off, because of the poor performance of the stock market and the fading
momentum of the government's privatization programme. The latter tailed
off sharply last year, with the government raising only Ffr25 billion from
the sale of corporate assets, less than half the Ffr60 billion achieved
in 1994. This year, with troubled giants such as Air France and Renault
notionally on the block, the prospects for early and remunerative privatization
business seem even more remote. <BR>
<BR>
Investment banks have turned to proprietary trading to offset the decline
in other areas of their business. &quot;Paribas in particular has become
very dependent upon proprietary trading for its profits,&quot; says Jacques-Henri
Gaulard, banking analyst at James Capel in Paris. The risks inherent in
this approach were seen recently when Ffr250 million in unauthorized trading
losses were discovered in the group's Spanish government securities trading
subsidiary, leading to the dismissal of two traders. &quot;This is just
one of a number of <I>casseroles</I> [cock-ups] at Paribas,&quot; says Gaulard.
&quot;They are giving the market the impression that they have very poor
controls.&quot; Poor controls were also blamed for a Ffr700 million loss
on swaps earlier in the year, which contibuted to Banque Paribas reporting
an overall loss of Ffr551 million for the year. These results, say analysts,
are not unconnected with the departure in January of the bank's capital
markets chief Patrick Stevenson. <BR>
<BR>
For Ogier, of Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, the main worry
is the situation in the retail-banking sector. &quot;It's acceptable for
us to be in a market where there are public and private institutions, as
long as the rules of the game are the same for everybody,&quot; he says.
&quot;Unfortunately, this is not the position at present in France.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Here he is echoing the strong reaction of the private-sector banks to practices
they regard as unfair competition. Most notably, this involved a concerted
public protest last year by Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale,
BNP, and CCF, against the amount of taxpayers' money that may be required
to rescue Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais. Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
has also been among the leaders in protesting against two special state-backed,
tax-free deposits: the Livret Bleu reserved by the state solely for Cr&eacute;dit
Mutuel and the Livret A for the post office and the Caisse d'Epargne savings
banks. CCF's chief executive, Charles de Croisset, likens this privilege
to &quot;a supermarket having a monopoly on the sale of red meat&quot; and
Ogier insists that its reform is a prerequisite for restoring the banking
sector to health. <BR>
<BR>
In pursuing their demands, the protesters have been partially successful.
The government recently agreed to some reform of the system, paring away
part of the monopoly, and creating a new tax-free deposit to be distributed
by any bank. But this did not appease the private-sector banks. They say
they would have preferred to see the system abolished entirely. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tough questions </B><BR>
<BR>
Ogier believes that if retail banking is again to become an attractive business
for Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, it needs radical restructuring.
<BR>
<BR>
Bank mergers are needed to reduce some of the overcapacity. France is one
of the most overbanked markets in Europe, second only to Germany, with 800
branches per million inhabitants. In recent months there has been much talk
about putting certain banks on the market. Andr&eacute; L&eacute;vy-Lang,
chairman of Paribas, has said the group intends to dispose of its troubled
retail-banking subsidiary Cr&eacute;dit du Nord unless the bank achieves
satisfactory profit levels this year. And insurance giant GAN, which is
slated for privatization, has said it will sell its banking subsidiary Cr&eacute;dit
Industriel et Commercial (CIC), France's seventh largest bank. <BR>
<BR>
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale has said it is interested in
buying CIC, but Ogier remains sceptical whether any deal GAN would accept
is likely to make commercial sense. This is partly because any acquisition
would involve rationalizing branch numbers and sacking staff. However, archaic
working practices, and restrictive labour laws dating back to the days when
most banks were state-controlled, make this very difficult to achieve. &quot;This
is the problem,&quot; says Ogier. &quot;If two banks try to merge, the French
system is pretty much blocked. No-one wants to fire thousands of people
under current circumstances.&quot; Few people expect any meaningful reforms
of the labour laws while unemployment remains a major political issue in
France. <BR>
<BR>
Given these impediments, Ogier says Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
is likely to continue focusing on the development of its commercial and
investment banking activities. Following a similar path is BNP which has
recently set itself up as a competitor to Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
in the derivatives markets. <BR>
<BR>
But it is at Paribas and Indosuez that perhaps the most significant changes
have taken place. Both have found themselves threatened by the dramatic
changes taking place in investment banking, as global players have started
to emerge from among the larger US firms and from the mergers of UK merchant
banks with continental universal banks. Five years ago, Paribas and Indosuez
were up there with the pack. In 1989, Indosuez even challenged Deutsche
Bank in the auction of Morgan Grenfell. Now they are perceived as also-rans.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Global pretensions</B> <BR>
<BR>
Dominique Hoenn, a member of the management board at Paribas, admits that
his bank was shaken up by the sudden spate of merchant bank takeovers in
London last year. &quot;It was certainly a worry for us,&quot; he says.
&quot;These UK merchant banks were our main European competitors, and now
they don't exist. They have been taken over by huge commercial banks whose
strategy at present seems to be simply to chase market share.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This factor has driven home to Paribas how difficult it will be for the
bank genuinely to compete as a global investment firm, one of its pretensions
until it became beset with problems. &quot;We do see ourselves as a global
player,&quot; says Hoenn. &quot;But if you mean by global investment bank
that we must provide every type of product for clients anywhere in the world,
I would say that is not what we are going to do. In the US, for example,
we have no desire to be a competitor to Merrill Lynch, selling US products
to US clients.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Hoenn explains that the bank's strategy is to achieve global coverage in
certain areas, while pursuing other business streams on a more ad-hoc basis.
The bank tends to stick to regions where historically it has enjoyed strength.
&quot;The main business stream for Pari-bas is in fixed income,&quot; he
says. &quot;Therefore, we intend to be a global player in treasury bonds,
with a presence as a primary dealer in all the major markets.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, there will be less emphasis placed on expanding the firm's
equity business. &quot;There is a focus in equities and that focus is Europe,&quot;
he says. &quot;We are committed to being able to distribute equity products
to any European customers.&quot; Outside Europe, there are a few other regions
where the firm has a presence which it intends to maintain. These areas
include Asia and Latin America, though these are, Hoenn says, &quot;more
related to history than any other choice&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Paribas has already undergone an internal transformation of its organization,
courtesy of its McKinsey exercise in 1994. The bank's management structure
has been reorganized globally along product lines, in place of the traditional
system which involved local offices managing their own affairs. Now the
bank is taking this a stage further, with the introduction of what it calls
the &quot;senior banker principle&quot;. This involves the creation of a
small group of managers &shyp; 20 in total &shyp; who are not attached to
any product area. These managers are assigned to handle certain of the bank's
clients, and their job is to promote the selling of all the bank's services
to those clients. <BR>
<BR>
Yet while these reforms seem individually impressive, many analysts question
whether Paribas has changed all that much. There are, they say, a great
deal of unanswered questions about the group. <BR>
<BR>
One concerns the group's unwieldy structure. Although Andr&eacute; L&eacute;vy-Lang
has promised to sell the weak retail-banking sub-sidiary Cr&eacute;dit du
Nord unless it comes right in the near future, analysts remain perplexed
by the group's odd mix of businesses. Compagnie Bancaire, the 47%-owned
specialist financial services subsidiary, is a curious rag-bag of companies,
including a large number of property subsidiaries which have been heavy
loss-makers. &quot;If you look at Compagnie Bancaire,&quot; says Gaulard
at James Capel, &quot;it has one really good asset, the leading French consumer
finance house Cetelem. That firm made all the money in the group last year,
and in 1993, and in 1992.&quot; He believes that Paribas should break up
Compagnie Bancaire, keeping only Cetelem and selling off all the other parts.
<BR>
<BR>
Another conundrum is Paribas Affaires Industrielles (PAI), Ffr40 billion
portfolio of equity investments beneficially owned by Paribas, which seems
semi-detached from the rest of the group and exceeds in value its market
capitalization by nearly Ffr10 billion. Traditionally, the investments existed,
in theory at least, as a way for Paribas to buy banking business &shyp;
other banks were then not allowed to be active investors in industry and
the bank sought to make money out of the relationship by selling banking
services to those companies in which it had an investment. But this arrangement
broke down in the 1980s and, ever since, although PAI has been a steady
(and in recent years the biggest) profit contributor to the group, analysts
have questioned whether the capital would not be better used elsewhere.
<BR>
<BR>
Hoenn refuses to be drawn on the question of PAI. &quot;We still maintain
that investing in corporations is a good thing for us to do,&quot; he says.
But following the group's poor results, which saw a write-down of Ffr2.1
billion in its 30% shareholding in Navigation Mixte and only Compagnie Bancaire
contributing profits from elsewhere, Paribas announced the disposal of Ffr15
billion of unspecified assets. Analysts see this as a first step to unwinding
PAI and reinvesting the capital in the group's core business. <BR>
<BR>
Paribas is likely to have the luxury of dealing with problems in its own
way because it is protected by what analysts call the &quot;spaghetti system&quot;
of cross-shareholdings, with 35% of its capital tied up by four shareholders,
including insurance giant Axa, Navigation Mixte, and Pargesa. No-one expects
these shareholders to take a hostile stance in shaking the company up. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A crippled bank</B> <BR>
<BR>
Banque Indosuez, on the other hand, has been less fortunate. It had to contend
with a single troubled shareholder &shyp; the industrial and financial holding
company Suez &shyp; and its new restructuring plan perhaps reflects the
brisk approach of its parent's new chairman, Gerard Mestrallet. <BR>
<BR>
Indosuez was a crippled bank. Weighed down by almost Ffr10 billion of property
loans and investments, more than half of which were doubtful or bad, the
bank was in no position to weather the prolonged downturn in the banking
sector. In 1994, Indosuez reported a net loss of Ffr1.1 billion, following
write-offs for property loans and investments of Ffr2.4 billion. Suez was
forced to inject Ffr1.1 billion of new equity just to allow the bank to
meet the minimum international banking standards. The situation put Suez
into an acute dilemma. <BR>
<BR>
Despite its capital injection, Indosuez clearly required further restructuring
and doubtless additional capital. The parent had to decide whether to stand
by its subsidiary or cut its losses and sell. Disastrously, Suez followed
both these courses. Under its previous chairman, G&eacute;rard Worms, the
group held discussions about the possible sale of Indosuez. Then Worms was
forced out and Mestrallet, the incoming boss, quickly gave a categorical
assurance that Indosuez was an integral part of the Suez group and was not
for sale. <BR>
<BR>
Mestrallet admits that the uncertainty caused what he describes as &quot;trouble
at the heart of the bank&quot;. There were defections of both staff and
clients. &quot;The entire Forex team walked out and went to Cr&eacute;dit
Lyonnais,&quot; says Gaulard at James Capel. &quot;This was very damaging
because foreign exchange was a big earner for the bank.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But having given his assurance that Indosuez would remain within the Suez
group, and effectively agreeing to put up further capital to allow the bank
to rebuild its damaged business, Mestrallet had every incentive to exact
some tough conditions for the refinancing. The Indosuez restructuring is
perhaps the most radical and Anglo-Saxon of any overhaul to be attempted
so far. <BR>
<BR>
It has been effectively cleansed of its property exposure, with Suez taking
over Ffr5.6 billion of Indosuez's more risky assets. &quot;Indosuez is the
only French bank completely relieved of [this involvement],&quot; says Mestrallet.
Suez has also disposed of its 75% stake in the UK fund management company,
Gartmore to NatWest Markets, for &#163;472 million, a decision taken partly
because it competed with Indosuez Asset Management for clients, but mainly,
analysts say, in order to raise the finance needed to recapitalize Indosuez
&shyp; Suez has promised a contribution of Ffr1 billion. <BR>
<BR>
The fresh capital, however, comes with strings attached. The bank has agreed
to cut operating costs by Ffr250 million to recapitalize Indosuez and to
achieve a return on equity of 9% within three years. &quot;It's a pretty
stiff task when you think that Indosuez has never achieved this,&quot; says
one analyst, who remains sceptical about the bank's ability to meet its
targets. <BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, Mestrallet has taken a scalp &shyp; that of Francois Lepetit,
the deputy chairman of the bank. &quot;I think when organizations go through
a new phase in their existence, you have to have a new patron,&quot; he
recently explained. &quot;The more significant the change, the more important
that is. Ten years ago in France it was not the case, but now France is
becoming more Anglo-Saxon. We needed a breath of fresh air.&quot; Lepetit
has been replaced by Christian Maurin, who was formerly head of Suez's Sofinco
subsidiary. <BR>
<BR>
In attempting to meet its targets, Indosuez will have less territory to
play. A key aspect of the agreement with Suez is that the bank will shrink
its markets to those regions of the world where it already has a strong
presence. Indosuez has thus abandoned any ambitions to be a global player
in investment banking. &quot;We are of medium size, we have to admit it
and we have not always done so in the past,&quot; says Maurin. <BR>
<BR>
A final aspect of the agreement with Suez relates to credit quality. Downgradings
in recent years have led average ratings for the leading French banks to
fall to the brink of investment grade. This damages their derivatives business
and other capital markets activities. But most banks need to be able to
offer derivatives products, for instance, if they are going to be able to
bid for bond mandates from their clients <BR>
<BR>
Indosuez will be forced to inject almost all of the ffr1 billion from Suez
into a ring-fenced vehicle responsible for the bank's market activities,
to ensure an AAA credit rating. <BR>
<BR>
It is perhaps too early to assess the significance of many of the changes
going on at French banks. While the downturn since 1992 has forced changes
of direction on some of the less fortunate players, much of the architecture
of earlier years remains in place. <BR>
<BR>
Although Gerard Mestrallet at Suez and Andr&eacute; Levy-Lang at Paribas
each claims that it no longer matters which school the bank's employees
attended, there is still evidence that the system of <I>pantouflage &shyp;
</I>whereby civil servants and political advisers shuffle between the public
and private sectors &shyp; is only slowly being abandoned. Evidence of this
can be seen in the case of Cr&eacute;dit Commercial et Industriel, which
recently appointed a new chief executive to guide it into the private sector.
Despite coming under considerable pressure to appoint Pierre-Matthieu Duhamel,
a 39-year-old former adviser to French prime minister Alain Jupp&eacute;,
the company surprised the markets by appointing a banker, Bernard Yoncourt.
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Pantouflage</I> and the spaghetti system continue to hold French banks
back. Analysts point out that by protecting managements from the consequences
of their actions, such systems simply promote the status quo and negate
the need for managers to take tough decisions. &quot;How can managers claim
to speak for all the shareholders when they are hiding behind a <I>noyau
dur </I>[core block of shareholders],&quot; asks one analyst. <BR>
<BR>
The reality is that only when shareholders have real power &shyp; as they
do in the case of Banque Indosuez &shyp; can radical changes be effected.
The same cannot yet be said of Paribas.

<H3><B>EMERGING MARKETS  </B></H3>

<P>

<B>Edited by Brian Caplen</B>

<P>
<B>LATIN AMERICA</B>

<H2>
<B>New moves by old conquistadors</B>
</H2>
<P>
Spain's leading banks are taking markedly different approaches to their Latin American expansion. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and Banco Santander, each of which lays claim to being Spain's biggest bank, are busy chasing returns on equity in Latin America well above domestic rates. And they both expect Latin American profits to contribute substantially to overall results. But their strategies for realizing these gains diverge sharply, with BBV going for joint ventures and Banco Santander looking for majority control or outright ownership. 

<P>
BBV's director general Gonzalo Terreros says: "Acquiring minority stakes in banks or taking the joint venture route means we do not have to go it alone in these markets which, although they share a common language with Spain, may require quite different strategies that are better understood by local partners.

<P>
"This approach also helps to limit our exposure to any one market. It would have cost us double the $1.2 billion we've invested so far had we gone for majority control of each bank." Terreros estimates total investment of $1.8 billion to $2 billion will be required to cover BBV's initial Latin American ambitions.

<P>
Juan Rodriguez Inciarte, Banco Santander's chief financial officer, points out that the time and effort involved in managing an overseas operation should be rewarded with a maximum return on investment. "If you value the work you've put into a venture you want to pass on as many of the benefits as possible to your shareholders," he says. "A majority shareholding or outright ownership also gives you an adequate level of management control over the business."

<P>
Where the two banks do agree is on the high level of returns they expect to reap from their Latin American investments. Both are confident that the region is on course for a stable political and economic future. "These countries have implemented serious and plausible reform programmes," says Terreros. "It is worth bearing in mind that Argentina meets all the Maastricht criteria."

<P>
Terreros says that BBV's decision to expand into Latin America was a simple and logical one. "We saw that what we did well in our core business could be successfully exported to our natural overseas markets. To a certain extent we are seeing in Latin America a repetition of what took place in Spain a few years ago: privatization, deregulation, sharper competition and a globalization of their economies."

<P>
Banking analyst Mariano Colmenar at BZW in Madrid points out that the relatively loose grip on the regulatory banking framework by most Latin American governments and the increasing number of privatizations have provided an impetus for Spanish expansion. "The operating outlook for banks in Latin America is similar to that prevailing in Spain some 10 years ago," says Colmenar. "Superior economic growth combined with high interest rates in an environment of restricted remuneration on deposits is the perfect combination for banks to show above-par financial spreads."

<P>
BBV has set itself a minimum target of 20% return on equity (ROE) for its Latin American investments, compared with the 15% it earns at home. Terreros says that, in some cases, such as Peru's Banco Continental in which BBV holds 38%, ROE has soared from 11% to 30% in 18 months. Mexico's Probursa, in which BBV holds 80%, is still well short of target, but Terreros expects the Mexican economy to return to what he terms its "cruising speed" next year.

<P>
So far, BBV has spent some $1.2 billion on its Latin American expansion. This includes shareholdings in banks in Colombia, Panama, Argentina and Puerto Rico, as well as Peru and Mexico. This year it expects to make about $400 million pretax profit from these operations, equivalent to about 30% of its estimated consolidated group profit. "Once our investments have reached a level of maturity Latin America's contribution to group profits should increase to 40%," says Terreros.

<P>
Banco Santander has also set a minimum 20% ROE in Latin America compared with 16% for the Spanish group. Rodriguez Inciarte says the bank is obtaining this in all operations except Puerto Rico's dollar-denominated economy. Banco Santander aims to boost Latin American profits from a current 14% to 20% of its $11.07 billion equity. The bank has set 20% of its consolidated equity as the maximum amount of capital it plans to invest in the region. The current book value of its investment is $1.55 billion.

<P>
"We consider ourselves <I>insiders</I> in Latin America," says Rodriguez Inciarte. "We have had a physical presence there for 40 years and the bank was, in fact, founded in 1857 to finance trade between Latin America and the port of Santander." 

<P>
"For us there is no such place as Latin America &#173; each country is a different market, although they nearly all share the same language and that is a crucial factor. I can send 30 people from Madrid to negotiate in Latin America and going through the books of any bank would not pose a problem for them."

<P>
BBV's Terreros agrees that language gives Spanish banks an edge over international rivals. "We negotiated our shareholding in Argentina's Banco Franc&eacute;s in only 18 days," he says. "It might not be so easy to perform a due diligence in Indonesia or North Africa, for example."

<P>
The acquisition of 30% of Banco Franc&eacute;s, Argentina's third largest bank, makes BBV the most exposed Spanish player in that country. BBV is also the only bank to take a serious plunge into the Colombian market by acquiring a 40% stake in Banco Ganadero, the country's largest financial institution.

<P>
Banco Santander's big play is Chile, where its merger and 75% holding in Banco Osorno y la Uni&oacute;n, for which it paid 2.8 times book value, makes it the country's largest bank with total assets in excess of Pta1 trillion. The bank's holding company is setting a $219 million capital increase to fund the acquisition, of which $120 million to $125 million will be raised through an initial public offering of 12% to 15% of the bank's shares. 

<P>
Banco Santander's Mexican exposure is largely through its investment banking operations, although it has just acquired a majority holding in Banco Mexicano. BBV is heavily exposed via its participation in Probursa and acquisition of two smaller retail banks.&#009;<B>Jules Stewart</B>

<B>CUBA</B>
</H4>
<H2>
<B>Bypassing Helms-Burton</B>
</H2>
<P>
On October 28 EU foreign ministers announced a regulation that will allow European companies penalized under the so-called Helms-Burton Act to claw back damages in European courts. It was the latest in a long line of international measures designed to undermine the deeply unpopular American act, which punishes companies deemed to be "trafficking" in expropriated US property in Cuba.

<P>
Few people though expect Helms-Burton to go in the short term, even if the Democratic Party &#173; less rabidly anti-Cuban than the Republicans &#173; wins the US presidential elections. Under the terms of the current waiver, liability for any transgression starts to accrue from the beginning of November; law suits are prohibited until next February. In the meantime, foreign banks in Cuba appear to be treading carefully &#173; even clandestinely. 

<P>
"When Helms-Burton first appeared [in March], it certainly scared a few banks and a number of them disappeared below the parapet," says Peter Scott, chairman of Beta Gran Caribe, which invests in Cuban assets through its subsidiary, Havana Asset Management. "I suspect that one or two cut their lines of credit temporarily, others reorganized through different channels."

<P>
The Dutch banking group ING &#173; which set up the first representative office of a foreign bank in Havana in 1994 &#173; has grown cautious, announcing in July that it was pulling out of financing the Cuban sugar industry, which uses plantations once owned by Americans. "We came to the conclusion that we couldn't ignore the legislation however much we disagree with it," says an ING spokesman. "But we will maintain our presence in Cuba and are fully committed to growing our business there."

<P>
The pullout of banks is leading to greater involvement of trading groups such as ED&amp;F Man Sugar, which was prominent in financing specific provinces in last year's sugar harvest. Alternatively, banks wishing to do business in Cuba are developing circuitous routes using off-the-shelf companies in the Caribbean and Central America to disguise their actions.

<P>
"It's easy enough to buy companies off-the-shelf in countries with closed ownership registers and create a trail of money transfers which is extremely difficult to track," says Scott. "Drug dealers and criminals have been doing this for the past 50 years. It's a matter of the banks taking a leaf out of their book."

<P>
Cuban government sources confirm that a lot of behind-the-scenes activity is taking place. They say 44 foreign financial institutions are involved in Cuba, although the vast majority have never been publicly identified. In addition, the government owns companies in countries such as Switzerland through which it can obtain financing for state projects. The Cubans have also been assisted by laws in Canada and Mexico which make it illegal for companies, including banks, from those countries to comply with Helms-Burton.

<P>
Foreign banks are perhaps encouraged by the fact that the US interest section in Havana has so far not demonstrated noticeable eagerness to pinpoint transgressors. The US authorities appear far less concerned with financing than with the purchase of assets. Only two companies have received letters under Title IV of Helms-Burton (which bars executives of the offending company from entering the US): the Domos Group from Mexico, which was involved in purchases in the telecommunication sector, and Canada's Sheritt International Corporation, which operates an expropriated US nickel mine. 

<P>
Nonetheless, banks with substantial US interests feel the need to watch their step. The revenues to be made in Cuba &#173; estimated in the region of $10 million for most of the 13 banks with representative offices in Havana &#173; are peanuts in relation to the profits from US operations.

<P>
Offshore banks such as NM Rothschild, which advised the Domos Group prior to the passage of Helms-Burton, and is now acting for a foreign mining company interested in acquiring a Cuban property, are taking a cautious view. "There are many cases where it is difficult to be sure whether the property has been expropriated or not," says Keith Palmer, managing director of corporate finance at Rothschild in London. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, which also advised Domos, is simply "watching and waiting", according to one of its London corporate financiers.

<P>
But institutions such as Beta Gran Caribe, which created the first investment fund for Cuba in February, believe there is a living to be made providing short-term finance to smaller companies with no outstanding US claim. "Helms-Burton doesn't affect us at all except marginally positively," says Scott. "One or two deals have become available to us which wouldn't have been available before, and interest rates have gone up a bit, which helps."

<P>
Meanwhile, two Russian banks, Stolichny Bank and Inkom Bank, are negotiating full banking licences. Observers say these are unlikely to be granted until the revolution in domestic Cuban banking, led by central bank governor Francisco Soberon and senior executive Jose Julio Rodriguez, is more complete. 

<P>
Three years ago the Cuban banking system was virtually non-existent. Che Guevara, who assumed the presidency of the Banco Nacional in 1961, turned it into a Soviet accounting tool. The state banks have since been divided into more logical units with fairly autonomous and reasonably efficient management. 

<P>
The Banco Nacional will lose its current multifunctional form later this year, to be replaced by a central bank charged with monetary policy and a development bank to take deposits and foster small business.

<P>
In the meantime, all the indications are that the Cubans are obtaining finance from foreign banks in spite of US efforts to deny them. A World Trade Organisation panel due to meet on November 20 to rule on EU complaints that the Helms-Burton Act is extra-territorial is likely to increase the pressure for the act to go.<B>&#009;Philip Eade</B>

<H4>
<B>KAZAKHSTAN</B>
</H4>
<H2>
<B>No murders please, we're Kazakh</B>
</H2>
<P>
The restructuring of Kazakhstan's banking sector may have reached a watershed with the failure of KRAMDS Bank, the largest casualty to date and one of the top five banks. The National Bank decided to pull KRAMDS' licence after a year-long struggle to rescue it. 

<P>
But regulators are claiming that the worst is over in a two-year long crisis that has seen the number of banks cut in half, with 55 forced to close or merge in 1995 alone and 30 more whittled down since January. 

<P>
As in many post-communist economies, Kazakh banks have suffered from imprudent lending, sometimes prompted by political pressures, in other cases due to speculative excesses. 

<P>
Most observers pinpoint gross financial mismanagement as the main cause of KRAMDS' collapse, starting with the $5.7 million Almaty headquarters, a $3.5 million office in Dzhambul and resort developments along the Black Sea and in Bulgaria. Unfortunately, the real estate market proved less than ideal when it tried to shed these holdings to raise quick cash. The bank also lost the chance to participate in the EBRD's small business development programme last year, when shareholders refused to raise the bank's capitalization, says EBRD deputy resident representative in Almaty, Michel Maries.

<P>
Yet KRAMDS' fall was also caused by conditions inherited from the Soviet era, when credits were given to enterprises regardless of the prospect of repayment. Local bankers says the government still puts pressure on banks to offer risky loans to prop up faltering factories. In KRAMDS' case, non-performing loans amounted to 60% of its credit portfolio. Many of the loans on KRAMDS' books belong to enterprises that no longer exist. 

<P>
But now the National Bank is getting tougher on such credits which may curb political lending. Since introducing new regulations in April 1995, the National Bank has stepped up efforts to force banks to reach higher levels of accountability or move aside. Capitalization requirements were raised to $1.5 million, and reserve demands set at 20%. Banks must now provide quarterly reports on performance, and the National Bank is sharpening training for its inspectors. 

<P>
The failure of KRAMDS was a major test for the regulators and one they seem to have passed reasonably well. "In most cases, you don't liquidate such a bank," says Grigory Marchenko, deputy director of the National Bank. 

<P>
Branches were closed, employees laid off and a frantic search for foreign investors undertaken. When a Singapore businessman was unable to agree immediately to a proposal in early October, the National Bank decided to call it a day, promising to pay off individual depositors starting in early 1997. Corporate clients, including 17 embassies and a number of international aid organizations, will have to wait longer to find out if, and when, they can expect to see any of their savings. Total deposits amount to Kt3 billion ($42.8 million). Despite extensive local press coverage of the liquidation, the National Bank managed to quell fears among depositors in other banks and kept panic withdrawals to a minimum.

<P>
The National Bank is claiming that Kazakhstan's other leading banks are safe, but the same may not be true of smaller institutions whose poor capitalization could yet bring them down. Once local banks increase their capitalization and tighten up, the future looks bright, says ABN Amro Kazakhstan's head of structured finance, Noman Siddiqui. "There's a lot of potential here that local banks can focus on." 

<P>
In the meantime, Kazakh bankers are breathing a bit easier than their Russian colleagues for at least one reason &#173; the murder rate among bankers is still zero. Although some attribute this to tighter government controls on law and order, one banker ventured: "We're very cautious about importing Russian banking culture." &#009;<B>Rachel Katz</B>

<B>ASIA&#009;&#009;</B>
</H4>
<H2>
<B>Seeing is not yet believing</B>
</H2>
<P>
Behind the euphoria that greeted the $1.9 billion three-tranche global bond, issued in early October by Malaysian oil company Petronas, there lies another story. The fine spreads and strong demand unleashed by the deal have led to declarations that interest in Asian credits has reached a new plateau.

<P>
But there is a different school of thought. This declares that Asian issuers are still the poor cousins of Latin Americans, when it comes to occupying the high-yielding exotic portfolios of US and European investors. A number of negative experiences has made investors shy and banks' due diligence of issuers has taken hold only recently. Before that banks would often agree to waive due diligence to attract an issuer on board, according to bankers in Hong Kong. Investors' concerns were a secondary consideration to getting the deal away. 

<P>
One deal that provides the counterweight to Petronas-inspired bullishness is a $200 million 10-year yankee for Indonesia's Sampoerna led by CSFB.

<P>
The US institutional investors who took these bonds in June thought they were buying into a company making clove cigarettes. Given their popularity with Indonesia's millions of smokers, this seemed a fairly safe bet. They were less happy come October when Sampoerna and its president director acquired a 12.5% holding in Astra International, Indonesia's premier car manufacturer, and intended to build its stake to 25%. The state secretary intervened with a decree to limit holdings to 10%. Then it was revealed that president Suharto and his associates were buying shares in the company. The auto business is highly political in Indonesia and one that passive debt investors might prefer to steer clear of. 

<P>
 Moody's has placed Sampoerna's long-term debt under review for a possible downgrade. "The latest annoucement in Moody's view clearly indicates that Sampoerna intends to pursue a much more aggressive diversification strategy away from the company's original plan as well as its willingness to use a higher level of debt capacity for this purpose," says a report by the rating agency. 

<P>
A spokesman for CSFB in New York says that full due diligence was done before the Sampoerna issue and points out that several months elapsed before the purchase of Astra shares. 

<P>
Due diligence for new credits is vital if the market is to mature, says Rosa Wong, executive director of financing and risk management products at UBS Singapore. The subject has dominated the monthly meetings of the debt market practices committee of the Hong Kong Capital Markets Association (HKCMA) over the past year or so. Although the committee, made up of the leading new issue banks in the region, could not agree unanimously on five proposed recommendations for due diligence criteria for issuance in the Asian time-zone, its chairman, Mark Bucknall, head of Asian new issues for HSBC, reckons its discussions were a catalyst for change. 

<P>
"It raised the debate about due diligence, and now 95% of deals undergo the process," he says. Banks are increasingly aware that they might be held liable if an issuer is not quite straight &#173; and even if it avoids punishment in the courts, its reputation will suffer. Yet it is impossible to create a template which can apply to, for example, the EIB and an Indonesian or Thai corporate borrower. 

<P>
Another banker points out that two years ago, agreeing to forego due diligence for a borrower gave a bank an edge over its rivals. "An Indonesian company would ask for a quote for a new bond issue, and then ask if you would conduct due diligence. If you said 'yes', then he would give his business to the competition." 

<P>
Concern first focused on the expanding FRN market. Because many investors were the same regional banks that bought CDs, which do not require due diligence, issuers of FRNs (and fixed-rate bonds too) managed to escape the rigorous examination that their counterparts in the Eurobond market were subject to under International Primary Market Association rules. Questions were raised, however, when innocent US and European investors came in to buy them. 

<P>
For several years, multilateral agencies and investment banks have promised a feast of Asian issuance to finance the region's structural development. But the story has started to sound a little jaded, plenty of jam tomorrow and a few crumbs today. Too often, the risk/reward ratio on offer just doesn't add up. Borrowers find cheaper funding in the syndicated loan market, and when they do issue bonds, yields are too low to compete with the staple Latin American offerings. And there are plenty of sharks to watch out for. Small wonder investors are cautious. 

<P>
"US and European investors still hold little Asian debt," says Patrick O'Brien, head of emerging market bond sales at SBC Warburg. Biggest buyers are Japanese and Korean banks, and many private deals end up in Taiwan swapped into dollars. "Name recognition is a problem with European investors," says Joe Cunningham, assistant director for new issues at ANZ International. 

<P>
But O'Brien is one banker who believes the Petronas deal does mark a departure for Asian issuers. Petronas, an A+/A1 rated credit, 51% owned by the Malaysian government, issued five-, 10- and 30-year bonds at 38, 57 and 85 basis points respectively over the US treasury curve. CSFB led the issue. "Petronas was a hugely impressive deal. There is always a bid for quality sovereign and quasi-sovereign issues." 

<P>
But will this demand filter down to lesser credits? At present, the answer is uncertain. Last month, JP Morgan took 25 US investors, representing assets worth $1.2 trillion on a tour of the region. According to Adam Howard, managing director of Asian capital markets for the bank, they were impressed with what they saw. But increasingly, corporate borrowers will need to satisfy the due diligence practices mainstream investors are used to. Then seeing will be believing.

<A NAME="faith"></A>Belgium's leap of faith </H2>
<H4><BR>
Belgium's economic plans rest on successful entry into European monetary
union. It's well on its way - but it doesn't meet Maastricht's debt criteria.
Laura Covill reports </H4>
There is a sense of now-or-never in Brussels. The Belgian government believes
that without fundamental reforms its small economy will not operate effectively
in a Europe which has introduced a single currency and thrown open regional
marketplaces to foreign competition. Limited ambitions which were realistic
10 years ago now look inadequate against the economic and market changes
Belgium is about to face. <BR>
<BR>
Belgium's economy and local capital markets stand to lose substantially
from Emu unless they change now. The Belgian government, led by prime minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene, has realized that, if Belgium does not act quickly, its
economy could fall so far out of step with the rest of Europe that Belgium
will not be able to join European monetary union. If this happens the Brussels
stock exchange would lose business so fast that it might not survive. Even
the country's bond market could collapse in the face of speculation against
the Belgian franc. <BR>
<BR>
But the present Belgian government is noteworthy for its apolitical and
single-minded approach to monetary union. After eight years in the job,
finance minister Philippe Maystadt is moving fast. A commission of strategists
- the Maystadt Commission - is working on further market deregulation; the
finance ministry has introduced innovations such as the X-N tax exemption
scheme; and privatization is progressing more quickly. The Belgian government
is also trying to lure investors with the Belgian franc's rock-steady exchange
rate against the Deutschmark, low inflation, better management of the country's
debt and more efficient financial markets. <BR>
<BR>
Behind all this is a profound belief that economic and monetary union in
Europe is the only way to greater economic stability for a small country
that sees itself at the heart of Europe. In turn, secure finances will enable
the government to seal the new political and economic arrangement for the
two main national groups, the French-speaking Walloons and the Dutch-speaking
Flemish community. <BR>
<BR>
There is no time to lose on any count: &quot;If Emu doesn't start in 1999,
we'll have to wait another 20 years before we're back in the same situation,&quot;
says Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian National Bank. <BR>
<BR>
This survey looks at the likelihood of Belgium being allowed into monetary
union, and the implications for the country's banks and capital markets.
<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H2><A NAME="emu"></A>Belgium needs Emu: the political solution to its economic
problems </H2>
<H4>Will Belgium turn its economy around in time for European monetary union?
Without Emu, the Belgian government fears that Belgian franc and government
debt issues will be punished by the markets </H4>
&quot;Nineteen ninety-six will be a special year for Belgium,&quot; prime
minister Jean-Luc Dehaene told international investors recently. &quot;Our
country will reach the 3% target for the budget deficit. This will end our
15-year journey through the fiscal desert.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Talk of Emu has scarcely been off premier Dehaene's lips since his centre-left
coalition returned to power in the May 1995 elections. Compliance with the
Maastricht criteria is more important to the Belgian government than any
other objective during this four-year term of office. Dehaene is passionately
keen to ensure that Belgium is included in the first group of countries
to adopt a single currency - perhaps as early as 1999. <BR>
<BR>
Belgium's achievements on three standards - price stability, interest rates
and stable exchange rates - are so solid they are dull. Consumer prices
rose by just 1.5% last year, and the Belgian franc is so closely aligned
with the Deutschmark that the Belgian National Bank is in danger of losing
its credibility as an independent entity. The National Bank has scarcely
broken step with the Bundesbank over the past year as the Germans have eased
their repo rate downwards in many tiny steps. The Belgian franc moves within
a band of plus or minus 0.5% against a central rate of Bfr20.6255 to the
Deutschmark. <BR>
<BR>
Because their currency has been pegged to the Deutschmark for the past six
years, the Belgians' room for manoeuvre is in fiscal planning and not in
monetary policy. In frequent statements about steadfastness, credibility
of policy and limiting inflation risks, National Bank governor Alfons Verplaetse
speaks the language of the Bundesbank with fluency. <BR>
<BR>
The Belgian authorities' greatest fear is over the exchange rate - an unstable
franc would leave Belgian government debt open to speculative attacks. The
National Bank and finance ministry are already dreaming of the third stage
of Emu, which will &quot;make this country part of the monetary area from
which all exchange rate risks will be permanently banished,&quot; in the
words of Verplaetse. <BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, the government has cut state spending so dramatically that
it is confident it can reduce the budget deficit to 3% of gross domestic
product (GDP) by the end of this year - &quot;barring excessive cyclical
or interest rate setbacks&quot;, says finance minister Philippe Maystadt.
This is remarkable given that the budget deficit amounted to 13.5% of GDP
in 1981, and was still 7.4% as recently as 1993. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our economy is based on solid fundamentals,&quot; says Dehaene. &quot;It
fulfils the basic requirements to benefit from any international recovery.
What is lacking is a revival in consumer confidence.&quot; To restore this
confidence the government has set three objectives: to moderate wages and
incomes so as to create jobs and remain competitive, to stimulate employment
(the jobless rate is 14.5%) and to make the social security system affordable.
<BR>
<BR>
But the Belgian people are already seething at the pace and ruthlessness
of spending cuts. Strikes and demonstrations have become commonplace. Yet
Maystadt draws encouragement from this: &quot;Foreign investors should take
comfort from the resilience of the Belgians.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The authorities recently used water cannon to shift demonstrators against
the latest cuts. But it will be far less straightforward to budge the government's
debt burden, which is nowhere near the Maastricht level of 60% of GDP. <BR>
<BR>
The overall public-sector debt burden in Belgium is colossal: it has topped
130% of GDP for the past eight years. It peaked at 137.9% of GDP in 1993,
caused by years of sluggish economic growth and excessive government debt.
The estimated debt figure for 1995 is 133.8% of GDP. <BR>
<BR>
The finance ministry tries to paint a brighter picture by pointing out that
Belgium's debt is expanding less rapidly every year. Nevertheless last year's
increase of 3.6% was substantial. And total debt at the end of 1995 amounted
to Bfr9.5 trillion ($302 billion) compared with Bfr7.6 trillion four years
earlier. <BR>
<BR>
But investors remember that the government's commitment to cut spending
and debt has been half-hearted in the past. As the National Bank itself
says: &quot;Over the past 15 years, periods of successful rehabilitation
alternated with periods when budget correction faltered, mainly because
short-term political and economic considerations gained the upper hand.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The government argues that it has adopted a new policy of discipline since
1993 (even though the same finance minister, Maystadt, has been in power
since 1988). This time, Dehaene's government has made Emu its number one
political objective. The 1996 budget includes cuts in spending and increases
in tax amounting to Bfr112 billion, or 1.5% of GDP. The extra charges include
a 0.5% rise in value-added tax to 21%, a tax on energy consumption and petroleum
products, and an increase from 13.39% to 15% in withholding tax . <BR>
<BR>
All these austerity measures are sure to have an effect. Economists believe
Maystadt will succeed in reducing overall indebtedness by 10 percentage
points by 1998, as promised. Moreover, the government also promises it will
spend any windfall income from improved economic conditions to reduce the
debt burden. But Belgium is unlikely to reach the 60% debt-to-GDP target
required for union under Maastricht's terms; certainly not by the beginning
of 1998. <BR>
<BR>
After tough talk on the economy Dehaene has revealed a more pliant approach
to getting over the last hurdle. He points out that Maastricht does not
insist on a ceiling of 60%, merely that &quot;the ratio is diminishing sufficiently
and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace&quot;. In fact,
Brussels' plan is to reduce debt gradually until the 60% level is finally
reached in 25 years' time. <BR>
<BR>
Konrad Aigner, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt, believes
EU heads of government will need &quot;extended discussions on whether the
reduction of Belgium's debt ratio can be regarded as satisfactory in Maastricht
terms&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Maystadt and Dehaene are confident that EU partner countries will allow
Belgium to join Emu immediately. &quot;We accepted the text [of the Maastricht
treaty] because it's formulated in such a way that we have a good chance
of joining the union. I wouldn't have signed it otherwise,&quot; Maystadt
says. &quot;The evaluation [of national economic performance] in 1998 involves
a degree of latitude.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, it becomes clear that Dehaene and Maystadt are talking politics.
&quot;I always make the comparison with German monetary union,&quot; the
prime minister says. &quot;On the technical advice [the Germans] shouldn't
have had reunification and monetary union in Germany, but on political criteria
there was a decision to pursue a monetary union.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In the end Belgium may rely on the argument that Emu will be viable only
if a core group of countries qualifies for membership. Those countries,
in Dehaene's view, include not only Germany and France, but Benelux too.
No wonder the Belgian government is keen to follow the precedent of German
unification. It is the ultimate political solution to an economic problem.

<BR>
After eight years as Belgium's finance minister, Philippe Maystadt is said
to be the leading candidate to replace Michel Camdessus as director of the
International Monetary Fund in Washington. Those who know him well think
he may stay to win Belgium a place in European monetary union. <BR>
<BR>
In spite of his country's various economic crises over the past decade,
Maystadt has won widespread respect as a reformer of the Belgian financial
markets. In his early days as finance minister, Maystadt reorganized the
government bond market and money market, established a system of primary
dealers and carried out the first reform of the stock exchange. <BR>
<BR>
In September 1990, <I>Euromoney </I>named Maystadt Finance Minister of the
Year. Since then, his name has been given to the Maystadt Commission, which
has been working on a range of further reforms of the Belgian financial
system. <BR>
<BR>
Maystadt is not an unexpected candidate for the directorship of the IMF.
He has been chairman of its interim committee since 1993 and has lobbied
for that committee to &quot;remain the body for political deliberation on
IMF policies and financing&quot;. He sees no need to change the role of
the IMF. &quot;The Bretton Woods institutions have successfully adjusted
to the evolving needs of their members,&quot; he argues. <BR>
<BR>
In particular, Maystadt has no time for the recent suggestions that the
IMF should restrict its authority to monetary systems and short-term macroeconomic
stabilization so that the World Bank can concentrate more on the structural
problems of the poorest developing countries. &quot;I don't believe it would
be wise to introduce such a strict separation of responsibilities... Even
for the industrial countries, it should be borne in mind that stable monetary
relations depend equally on sound macroeconomic and structural policies.
The IMF must thus definitely keep its say on countries' structural policies,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
But would Philippe Maystadt be prepared to move to Washington? <BR>
<BR>
Belgian financiers who know him well say that if Maystadt were offered the
prestigious IMF position, he might turn it down anyway. The 48-year-old
from Belgium's French-speaking region of Wallonia is happy close to home,
they say. Apart from a brief spell at business school in the United States,
he has spent his entire career in and around Brussels, first as an assistant
professor at the famous Catholic University of Louvain, then as a professional
politician since 1977. <BR>
<BR>
Maystadt is fond of life as a Brussels politician, and close associates
say he has a strong personal ambition to win Belgium a place in the first
round of Emu. &quot;His dream as finance minister is to bring Belgium to
the 1999 deadline for European monetary union. So he would hesitate about
quitting now,&quot; says one. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, Maystadt is so patriotic he threatened to resign last year when
Sabena, the national airline, planned to relocate 480 pilots to neighbouring
Luxembourg in order to save social insurance costs. Maystadt won: a loophole
in the law was created so that Sabena paid fewer contributions. The pilots
stayed at home, and Maystadt remained in the government. <BR>
<BR>
It will be difficult for Maystadt to leave while Belgium's economic future
hangs in the balance. If he does go to Washington, his greatest regret may
be that a finance minister's reputation is only as good as the economy he
helps to run. His most likely replacement is the present budget minister,
Herman von Rompuy. <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H2><A NAME="survival"></A>Survival of the biggest </H2>
<H4>Finance minister Maystadt has told Belgium's main banks they will have
to merge to survive in post-Emu Europe. But the idea of a &quot;Grande Banque
Belge&quot; is beset with difficulties. Some banks think they're strong
enough to go it alone and others are restrained by powerful shareholders
</H4>
Over the past nine months Belgian bankers have been hounded by the idea
of a Belgian super-bank. Those who are tired of constant speculation know
exactly who to blame. <BR>
<BR>
Last August Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer, chief executive of Banque Bruxelles
Lambert (BBL), advertised his search for a partner capable of lifting BBL
out of the regional Benelux market and into the international banking league.
&quot;I would like to leave the bank at the end of 1996 having set in motion
an alliance with one of the world's banking giants,&quot; he said. <BR>
<BR>
It was an attractive idea. A merger between BBL and the nation's largest
bank, Generale Bank, would have created an institution with assets of more
than Bfr11 trillion ($350 billion) that would have ranked among the world's
top 15 banks by assets. This captured the imagination of the local financial
community, which tagged the scheme Grande Banque Belge, or GBB for short.
<BR>
<BR>
The government is concerned that a single currency will eliminate Belgian
banks' business advantage in Belgian francs. &quot;Belgian banks will lose
the protection and supremacy the Belgian franc currently gives them,&quot;
says Elio di Rupo, economics minister. <BR>
<BR>
In Belgium's small economy, trade with neighbouring countries is particularly
significant. The banks have traditionally earned well from forex business.
At the same time, the Belgian franc is so stable against its main reference
currency that there are few opportunities for arbitrage. The Belgian Bankers'
Association estimates that Belgian banks will lose between Bfr15 billion
and Bfr20 billion from lost foreign exchange commisssions if the single
currency is introduced. &quot;We are losing forex earnings and at the same
time we have to make investments in systems,&quot; says Ren&eacute; Myncke,
capital markets head at Generale Bank. &quot;So we get hit on both sides.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Finance minister Maystadt is impressed by the Dutch banks' example and points
out that ABN Amro, the largest bank in the Netherlands, is as large by assets
as five of the largest seven Belgian banks combined. But Ferdinand Chaffart,
chief executive of Generale Bank, is unimpressed. &quot;He has this fixation
that big is beautiful,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
However, the finance minister was probably trying to support Cardon, too.
Nine months after his first initiative, it is becoming embarrassing for
Cardon that no foreign banks have shown any interest in buying BBL. <BR>
<BR>
At first it seemed BBL would merge with Cr&eacute;dit Communal (CCB), the
nationwide savings bank network and 12% shareholder in BBL. But after months
of speculation, CCB has decided to link up with Cr&eacute;dit Local de France
in a 50:50 cross shareholding arrangement. There are rumours that the CCB
shareholding in BBL may be up for sale. <BR>
<BR>
Cardon of BBL had hoped another large foreign bank would be interested in
his plan. The prime candidate was another of his major shareholders, ING
Bank of the Netherlands. (In fact ING had already made an unsuccessful bid
for BBL in 1992.) For weeks there was no sign of activity. <BR>
<BR>
Then in early April a third powerful shareholder revealed that a plan to
merge BBL and Generale Bank had been thwarted by ING. Etienne Davignon,
chairman of Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Belgique and
thus a 30% shareholder in Generale Bank, made it known that ING refused
to accept the plan because it aspired to create a rival to ING. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers in Brussels say the Belgian banks have so many important shareholders,
each with different interests, that the GBB plan is impossible. Moreover,
cross-holdings in Belgium are so tightly interwoven that any merger plan
would attract the attention of the competition authorities. <BR>
<BR>
Enough is enough, says Chaffart of Generale Bank, who is now trying to stamp
out further speculation about the bank's future by promising that the bank
will go it alone. <BR>
<BR>
It has announced several new schemes to increase the bank's reach. Under
the terms of a recent agreement with Belgium's postal service, the bank
will market savings and loan products via the 1,800 post offices and the
post office will be able to upgrade and broaden its range of financial products.
Generale Bank has also bought the Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais subsidiary in the
Netherlands and is looking for a partner in North-Rhine Westphalia in Germany.

<H2><A NAME="art"></A>The art of rekindling foreign investment </H2>
<H4><BR>
International investors in Belgian government bonds retreated in 1993 and
many have yet to return. The finance ministry was thrilled when 400 investors
and analysts turned up at a bond road-show in Brussels recently. But there
are still deterrents for would-be investors </H4>
Just how seriously does the Belgian government take its debt management
programme? Deadly seriously, discovered 400 analysts and investors invited
to question prime minister, finance minister and National Bank governor
at a recent roadshow. <BR>
<BR>
It's seven years since the Belgian government first took a professional
approach to borrowing. In 1989, the finance ministry set up competitive
auctions for the monthly sale of public debt (Obligation Lin&eacute;aire
Obligatie - OLOs) and treasury certificates (CTs). A new system of primary
dealers followed in 1991. This introduced proper market-making and improved
liquidity for Belgian government bonds. Smaller changes have been made since,
including regular investor roadshows and the appointment of an interprimary
dealer. <BR>
<BR>
The ministry was rewarded with better liquidit and transparency, more foreign
investors and, above all, cheaper funding. Finance minister Philippe Maystadt
reckons the reform and development of the government bond market cut debt
management costs by around Bfr70 billion ($2.2 billion) each year. <BR>
<BR>
The auction system eliminated commission paid to intermediaries, saving
Bfr71 billion between 1991 and 1995. Over the same period, the liquidity
premium on outstanding OLOs - although not eliminated - was reduced by 25
basis points, making borrowing cheaper. The facility of call options on
long-term debt enabled the ministry to refinance one third of its domestic
debt with a discount of up to 200bp over the past three years. There is
enormous potential for further savings. <BR>
<BR>
Last year, Maystadt relaxed tax policy and allowed international and institutional
investors to trade, free of withholding tax, any fixed-income security issued
in Belgium. Moreover, a number of European institutional investors, such
as German insurance companies, have been freed from restrictions which previously
banned them from buying foreign sovereign debt. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately no-one told the international investors. Several years ago,
the percentage of outstanding OLOs owned by non-residents of Belgium was
up to around 20%. Now it's back down to between 4% and 5%. The ministry
is disappointed. &quot;Foreign ownership of OLOs and treasury bills has
been between 5% and 10% for a while. A good range is between 5% and 15%,&quot;
says a ministry source. &quot;Foreign investors bring liquidity and sophistication.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The road-show, held in late March, tried to impress investors with promises
of Teutonic monetary discipline plus a higher yield than Bunds - the main
reference point for Belgian debt. &quot;We've had convergence with Germany
already. It's basically like a German market with a spread attached,&quot;
says Sylviane Delcuve, trading room strategist at Generale Bank, expressing
exactly the view the ministry wants to put across. <BR>
<BR>
Traders in Brussels say foreign investors left when the exchange rate with
the Deutschmark became too volatile during the 1993 currency turbulence.
Investors decided that, although Belgian government bonds still offered
a yield pick-up over Bunds, it was no longer sufficient to cover the currency
risk. But the Belgian franc has scarcely moved against the Deutschmark for
over a year. To emphasize this renewed stability, the finance ministry describes
the exchange rate as &quot;clinically dead&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Still, Belgium has ambitious targets for economic convergence over the next
two years - if it does not achieve these, it may not be accepted as a member
of Emu. For Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, everything else takes second
place to meeting the Maastricht goals. <BR>
<BR>
The paradox is that the more international investors buy and hold Belgian
bonds, the more the spread will decrease: the lower the spread, the less
attractive an investment in Belgian debt becomes. &quot;With an improving
perception of the interest-rate risk there's a lower incentive to bring
foreigners in to narrow the spread,&quot; acknowledges the finance ministry
source. <BR>
<BR>
But what is the right yield for Belgian debt? The ministry and investment
community disagree about the nation's economic prospects. The picture has
been confused further by speculation over Emu. The spread over Bunds has
been falling consistently since the Belgian franc was pegged to the Deutschmark
in 1990. At that time Belgian 10-year debt yielded around 200bp over Bunds;
after Dehaene's coalition government was confirmed in power last year the
spread narrowed to 40bp. Since then, the government has introduced further
austerity measures, spending cuts and debt reduction plans. Now the Kingdom
of Belgium's Dm1 billion bond with a maturity date of 2001 is trading at
between 20bp and 25bp over Bunds. <BR>
<BR>
While the interest rate differential between Germany and Belgium has almost
disappeared in the short term (the three-month Belgian interbank offered
rate is only 15bp over Frankfurt's interbank offered rate), many market
participants believe the long-term spread is not high enough. <BR>
<BR>
Sources at the Belgian finance ministry believe the current spread is split
equally between credit risk and exchange-rate risk. The ministry is convinced
the former is decreasing - the latter should by rights have disappeared
already. <BR>
<BR>
Delcuve of Generale Bank disagrees. She thinks Belgium's credit risk is
worth as much as 25bp to 30bp and that this gap will remain even after Emu
and the elimination of currency risk. &quot;If you believe in Emu the spread
should be 20 to 30 [basis points above Bunds],&quot; Delcuve says. &quot;For
current circumstances, 40 to 50 points is right.&quot; Keith Edmonds, an
analyst at Industrial Bank of Japan in London, believes the 10-year spread
will soon advance to 50bp over Bunds. <BR>
<BR>
Ben Weekers, head of bond trading at Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais in Brussels,
identifies a liquidity risk on Belgian bonds. He compares two Deutschmark
issues maturing in 2003: the 6.25% Eurobond from the Kingdom of Belgium
and the 6.00% Bund. Over the past 18 months the spread between the two stayed
between 15bp and 25bp which, Weekers says, &quot;represents the different
creditor and liquidity risk attached to the two bonds&quot;. Weekers argues
that the yield spread between Germany and Belgium would drop below 15bp
if Emu went ahead. But judging by the yield curve investors remain uncertain
over Belgium's economic future - the longer the maturity, the higher the
premium. The Belgian yield curve is already the steepest in Europe. <BR>
<BR>
Emu cannot come early enough for Dehaene, who insists that Belgium will
meet the Maastricht criteria in time to be accepted into the union from
the beginning. Few observers doubt Dehaene's political will to make the
necessary cuts in spending, however painful they will be for the local economy.
<BR>
<BR>
But there are questions over Belgium's complex relationship with its currency
ally, Luxembourg, with or without Emu. For Belgium the most frightening
notion is that the markets may anticipate a break-up of the currency union
between Belgium and Luxembourg and speculate against the Belgian franc.
If the franc falls, Belgian debt yields will rise. <BR>
<BR>
Two possible outcomes could induce Luxembourg to abandon currency union
with Belgium. The first is if Emu goes ahead in 1999 without Belgium. Alternatively,
if Emu is postponed, Luxembourg may decide to link up with Germany. Although
neither scenario is likely, the markets are beginning to speculate. The
more speculation, the more traders will be willing to create a price differential
between Belgian and Luxembourg debt. <BR>
<BR>
In the currency swaps market, there has been a yield gap between Luxembourg
and Belgian francs for some time. Luxembourg already fulfils the Maastricht
criteria easily, and its economic performance is superior to Belgium's on
every count. So although the two currencies are officially at par, the Luxembourg
version of the franc is perceived by the derivatives market to be worth
more in the long term. According to Anne Leclercq, local currency manager
at Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais in Brussels, there's a clear differential of roughly
12bp to 25bp between swaps in the two currencies. <BR>
<BR>
Leclercq points out that Belgian banks are happy to trade the difference
because it gives them opportunity to build up assets in Luxembourg francs,
thus matching the Luxembourg franc liabilities they have accumulated in
their balance sheets. The Belgian National Bank is unhappy with the situation.
But Leclercq doubts the National Bank will intervene to prohibit quotes
of swap rates for Luxembourg francs. &quot;That would increase the rumours
about a possible break between the Belgian and the Luxembourg francs. The
National Bank would not do anything that would encourage rumours,&quot;
says Leclerq. <BR>
<BR>
Needless to say, the ministry refuses to acknowledge any real danger of
a schism with the Luxembourg franc. It will also not consider issuing debt
in Luxembourg francs - even though it would cost less. &quot;There is no
other scenario for us,&quot; says a ministry source. &quot;We have begun
to implement measures for Maastricht. Any possible contingency planning
and our sound debt management planning are one and the same thing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Debt management for the Belgians is based on three main objectives. First,
the ministry is converting debt into longer-term borrowing. &quot;We want
to lengthen maturities because there's an even and long repayment which
will enable us to control the budgetary constraints on the state, and there's
a limited refunding risk,&quot; says the finance ministry. The government
is buying back short-term foreign currency debt as the Belgian franc appreciates.
Whereas short-term borrowing comprised 31% of Belgian debt five years ago,
it is now only 20%. Moreover, the finance ministry plans to introduce 30-year
debt when market conditions are right. <BR>
<BR>
A second goal is to reduce the share of foreign currency debt, which has
fallen from 14% to 11% over the past year. &quot;This trend reflects the
fact that domestic saving can supply us with enough capital to meet our
needs,&quot; Maystadt says. Finance ministry sources point out that &quot;Belgium
has a current account surplus, so there's no point borrowing in foreign
currencies. Why run a currency risk?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The ministry is also dampening further speculation against Belgian franc
denominated debt by leaving open whether it will convert its existing debt
into euros immediately after monetary union in 1999. This could involve
recalling all Belgium's outstanding debt, and reissuing it in euros. In
these circumstances, Belgian franc debt might be treated as short-term paper.
This, in turn, could leave it vulnerable to speculation from hedge funds.
<BR>
<BR>
Here, the finance ministry makes a distinction between the 80% of outstanding
debt which is in the portfolios of professional investors, and the 20% held
by individuals (known as la <I>dette grande publique</I>). Says a source
at the ministry: &quot;We intend to consult professional investors and especially
the primary dealers to ensure that when we convert to euros there'll be
no technical problems. &quot;With the <I>dette grande publique</I> we need
to consider that the public needs educating about the euro. Everything which
concerns the public has to be handled with the greatest care.&quot; By contrast,
new Belgian government debt will be issued in euros &quot;as soon as possible&quot;
- even if Belgium is not among the first countries in Emu - to take advantage
of the absence of currency risk for investors in monetary union countries.
<BR>
<BR>
But even then the Belgian franc's troubles will not be over, because Belgian
investors still prefer other European currencies to their own. &quot;The
Danish kroner is still considered the second-best after Luxembourg francs
because of the good economic situation in Denmark,&quot; says Jacques Romainville,
head of syndication and new issues at Generale Bank. In his experience,
up to 75% of Danish kroner issues are placed in the Benelux countries. Like
Luxembourg franc issues, Danish kroner issues offer superior economic performance
to Belgium's for a similar spread over bunds. <BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, the finance ministry and the primary dealers in Belgian
government debt need to make the market more liquid. But Delcuve of Generale
Bank argues that if foreign investors did return <I>en masse</I>, volatility
would also increase. That would be a dangerous development in a situation
where the market is still small and volatile. A step in the right direction
was the appointment last year of De Posson as an inter-primary dealer broker
(IPDB), in an attempt to win back volume from the London market. De Posson
is charged with bringing down bid/offer spreads - particularly when the
market is illiquid. It will be responsible for trading between the 15 primary
dealers. Previously, in times of volatility, these primary dealers stopped
quoting if they couldn't stick to a corridor of 5% to 10% either side of
the spread. <BR>
<BR>
Yet the IPDB system has its limits too. At the end of last year Generale
Bank's own-account traders sold substantial amounts of government bonds.
Opinions are divided on whether the move was conventional profit-taking,
or an attempt to improve the bank's profit and loss account before the end
of the financial year. As a result of that single initiative, according
to one senior trader in Brussels, the spread over Bunds temporarily climbed
from 45bp to 80bp. It's not the kind of incident that will encourage foreign
investors to return. <BR>

<P> It is a sad parting of the ways for both sides. Hermon openly admits that his
nine years at the bank were extremely enjoyable. "Fleming is a very special
institution which manages to be aggressive and successful but also highly
civilized," he says. "Perhaps only Lazards has those same qualities."

<P> And Fleming will miss Hermon. In order to maintain its earnings momentum the
group has come to rely upon a major profit contribution from Jardine Fleming, its
money-spinning Far Eastern arm owned 50:50 with Jardine Matheson. JF's profits
peaked in 1993 and UK-based Robert Fleming has been unable to take up the
earnings slack.

<P> Fleming's "crown jewels" are its asset management business and Jardine
Fleming. The money management business is rock-solid but unlikely to grow faster
than the industry as a whole; Jardine Fleming is the in-house "shooting star",
the most highly regarded and most profitable major investment bank in the
Asian-Pacific region. To lose the key producer in your star division will cause
concern in the Fleming boardroom.

<P> In his three years in Hong Kong, Hermon's name became synonymous with the
success of Jardine Fleming's capital markets business in Asia. The consistent
flow of equity and equity-related bond issues lead-managed by Jardine Fleming
became the bank's best calling card. Many of those offerings provided investors
with huge profits as the Pacific region stock markets surged. Some rose by 200%
to 300%. "There were relatively few disappointments," agrees Hermon.

<P> In a career which began with Kidder Peabody &#173; where Stanley Ross and
Hans-Joerg Rudloff posted him to the firm's Hong Kong office &#173; and included
seven years with Lehman Brothers, Hermon worked mainly with fixed-rate bonds. The
move to Fleming in 1987 was essentially to become an equities specialist. "The
bank was a pure equity house. If they owned any fixed-rate bonds it was either by
mistake or on a client's instructions," recalls Hermon. In particular he
developed a highly successful partnership at Fleming with the brash Ian Hannam,
who joined the bank from Salomon Brothers in January 1992. "Ian Hannam in London
and Colin Hermon in the Far East proved to be a dream-team combination for the
bank," says a managing director of Peregrine.

<P> Hermon was the consummate business-getter, with an instinctive feel for
uncovering new mandate opportunities. He criss-crossed the region, bringing back
lucrative financing assignments from India (where he is regarded as one of the
foremost capital-raising experts), Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and
the Philippines. Although Fleming was expanding rapidly in other regions,
including Latin America and Africa, the Hong Kong connection with Hermon produced
the lion's share of the bank's capital markets business and profits.

<P> Why has such a successful and rewarding partnership come to an end? It's no
secret that Hermon wanted to return to the UK to take responsibility for some of
his old coverage areas and to become involved with emerging markets in Europe.
Recently divorced, he wanted to be able to see more of his two young children,
Freddy and Angelica. Was there some disagreement with his colleague, Ian Hannam,
who had been appointed to Fleming's main board of directors? Was there an
objection to the recruitment of Michael Hammond from SBC Warburg to work with
Hannam? Did Fleming not offer Hermon the territorial coverage areas which he had
requested?

<P> <B>An amicable parting</B>

<P> Probably there was some dissension, but both sides claim that the parting is
entirely amicable. What else would you expect from close-knit, gentlemanly
Fleming &#173; Hermon himself went to Eton, as did most members of the Fleming
family &#173; who would never lower themselves to arguing in public?

<P> Two points immediately emerge from Hermon's departure. First, Fleming has to
find a replacement for him as soon as possible. Within Fleming there are no
easily identifiable candidates, so look for a high-profile (&#163;500,000 plus
compensation package) from outside. Secondly, Hermon becomes a very hot property
himself.

<P> "Colin can take his pick of the main investment banks, but if he wants to get
out of the pressure cooker he could join a niche organization or even one of his
corporate clients," says a former colleague from Lehman Brothers. A close friend
from Hong Kong adds: "The real attraction of Colin is that he has produced all of
his business essentially with just himself and one assistant and we all know that
he could do it again, even without the Jardine Fleming umbrella."

<P> Don't expect Hermon to be idle for very long.

<H3> <B>Henri Calame</B> </H3> <P> <B>Chairman and managing partner Coges &#173;
Geneva</B>

<P> Turn the clock back 12 years. It's 1984 and you are in Geneva. What's the
talk of the town in the elegant bars of the Hotel Des Bergues, the Beau Rivage
and Le Richemond?

<P> The gossip is about political and financial affairs in France, now governed
by the Socialists. The most immediate impact to be felt by the Geneva banking
community is that Paribas (Suisse), employing more than 800 people and totally
independent from French influence, is to be sold back to its Paris parent. Merde!

<P> If the Geneva bankers were aghast, think about Paribas' clients, the majority
of whom were French. The prospect of their Swiss assets being scrutinized by the
French authorities was not acceptable. What to do? They could have simply
transferred the assets to another Geneva bank but they were comfortable with
Paribas, and their portfolios had performed well. To provide a solution, a number
of them asked Henri Calame, the head of the private banking division, to create a
safe haven for their funds.

<P> Calame, a highly experienced Swiss banker who had been trained by Hambros in
London and Paris during the 1960s, rejected the idea of forming a new bank. With
commendable foresight he advised his clients that there were already too many
banks in Geneva. Instead, with 11 other former colleagues and friends he founded
Corrateri Gestion (Coges), which would act as a private portfolio management
company.

<P> A pure portfolio management company, however, could not provide all the
banking services required by his clients. Calame found the answer by forming an
association with the prestigious private banker Lombard Odier &amp; Cie, which
subscribed and took a majority interest in the capital of Coges.

<P> Today, Coges is one of Geneva's most successful medium-sized money managers.
Lombard Odier still has a substantial minority shareholding and continues to
provide clearing, settlement and safe-custody facilities for Coges, as well as a
full range of banking services for the firm's clients.

<P> Has the association been happy, rewarding or even, at times, frustrating? "As
in any good marriage," says Calame, "we have experienced all of those. However,
the result has been a total success."

<P> But have there recently been some ripples in the normally still waters of
private Swiss asset management? Certainly the Geneva financial community senses a
wind of change. As in London and New York, asset management companies are hot
properties. In Geneva, the highly regarded Cook &amp; Cie was bought by MC
Securites and an investor group associated with financier Hans-Joerg Rudloff for
an undisclosed sum which is thought to have been a dizzy 3% of total assets under
management.

<P> <B>Boutique intrigue</B>

<P> Along the bars and restaurants of the Quai des Bergues there have been dark
rumours concerning the intentions of a new financial boutique &#173; de Pury,
Pictet and Turrettini. These are names to conjure with. David de Pury is a
skilled diplomat who represented Switzerland in the GATT talks and was, until
recently, co-chairman of Asea Brown Boveri. Guillaume Pictet is a scion of the
great Genevese private banking family. Henri Turrettini is one of four well-known
brothers in Swiss property and banking. Has Calame's Coges found itself the
target of unwanted attention?

<P> Guillaume Pictet in fact worked for Calame at Coges. By all accounts the two
enjoyed an entirely amicable and enjoyable working relationship. Sources in
Geneva say that strains appeared only when Pictet suggested to Calame that he
might relinquish some of his responsibilities and shareholding over a specified
period. When Calame declined (one of his two sons might eventually wish to enter
the business), the Geneva sources say that he was presented with an effective
ultimatum: the new de Pury group would combine with Coges and leave Calame with
vastly reduced influence and responsibility in the enlarged company. The normally
imperturbable Calame may have been astounded, but in true Coges corporate style
(the firm doesn't disclose even its total assets under management) said nothing.

<P> Among Swiss private bankers and money managers the rumours were greeted with
amazement and some incredulity.

<P> The de Pury group certainly received an answer from Calame: "No way."
Guillaume Pictet is no longer with Coges. Henri Turrettini suddenly departed from
swanky private bankers Mirabaud &amp; Cie. So the de Pury camp has been rebuffed?
It looks that way, but the implacable Calame remains coolly aloof. "At Coges we
have always applied a strategy of continuity," he says. "This strategy and the
growth potential of the company remain valid and unchanged."

<H3> <B>George Ugeux</B> </H3> <P> <B>Group executive vice-president
international (elect) &#173; New York Stock Exchange</B>

<P> "Georges is on the hoof again." This was how one senior Luxembourg banker
relayed the news that Georges Ugeux had accepted a newly created position heading
the international marketing and liaison group for the New York Stock Exchange.

<P> Certainly Ugeux has gained a reputation for being peripatetic. "He is Belgian
banking's number one rolling stone," says a former colleague at Generale Bank in
Brussels. But Ugeux has not only enjoyed his career as an itinerant. He has also
prospered. The promise of a glittering career at Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Banque (also known as Generale Bank) in Brussels was
marred by only one consideration. The pay was abysmal.

<P> Ugeux remembered Dick Whittington's advice that the streets of London were
paved with gold and decamped to Morgan Stanley, then in offices in the Commercial
Union Building rather than Canary Wharf. His arrival couldn't have been better
timed. Morgan Stanley went public. He had some stock and, more important, some
options. Virtually overnight he made more money than in his entire working career
with his old bank in Brussels.

<P> Having made his name and fortune as a Morgan Stanley investment banker, Ugeux
returned to Brussels at the request of Etienne  Davignon and Herv&eacute; de
Carmoy to assist in sorting out the Generale Group's labyrinthine affairs, and in
particular its industrial holdings portfolio. This is a period of Ugeux's career
which received little publicity but of which he is proud.

<P> "We essentially sold or regrouped businesses with a value well in excess of
$8 billion," he says.

<P> Perhaps missing those munificent Wall Street year-end bonuses, he came back
into the investment banking limelight as president of Kidder Peabody
International (KPI). KPI was a suitable case for treatment. In Europe all the
Kidder Group's money was made by Kidder Peabody Securities in sales and trading.
KPI was the investment banking arm with a long and mainly undistinguished record.
Kidder in New York had fallen so far down the league tables it had almost
disappeared.

<P> <B>Kidder's Mr Europe</B>

<P> Even if Ugeux never succeeded in making KPI into a Morgan Stanley, he was
like a lucky charm for the Kidder Group. Profits, mainly due to domestic
mortgage-backed trading and Kidder Peabody Securities in Europe, recovered
strongly. As a member of the key New York executive committee, he was seen as
Kidder's Mr Europe, and was rewarded accordingly.

<P> But Kidder was a house of cards. In April 1994 Joe Jett's "false" trading
profits of $350 million were discovered. By the end of 1994 Kidder was bust, a
victim of inept management and huge losses in its mortgage business.

<P> PaineWebber, which purchased the Kidder carcass, had no suitable position for
a high-flyer like Ugeux. He quickly emerged as president of the European
Investment Fund in Luxembourg, where he excelled, and with a very small group
completed transactions worth more than Ecu1 billion ($1.27 billion) in just over
a year.

<P> The call from the New York Stock Exchange, however, proved irresistible to
Ugeux. He was intrigued by the challenge of the new position and his status as a
member of the office of the chief executive (Richard Grasso). He'd also never
lived in New York.

<P> In his new role he will promote new listings for the NYSE, maintain
relationships with the existing listed non-US companies and liaise with other
stock exchanges, particularly on regulatory change. That would keep anyone busy
&#173; but Ugeux says he is not perturbed. Perhaps at last the rolling stone will
come to a halt?

<H3>THE MOORGATE SAGA </H3>
<H2>Cash for the loveable chubbie </H2>
<B>Coutts &amp; Co., 440 Strand, London WC2R 0QS (Established 1692 - bankers
by appointment to HM The Queen)</B> <BR>
<BR>
I am standing around in this financial mausoleum where the morticians wear
frock coats, when I hear voices raised and a mahogany door slams open and
out bursts this redhead, yelling: Any more of this expletive deleted from
you and I'll take my overdraft elsewhere. <BR>
<BR>
Now I can see why Bob Alexander asks me to look in here, apparently this
is the home of the NatWest's up market brandname, you might figure it offers
taxidermy as a sideline but Bob says the clients find the atmosphere soothing,
it lends money to royalty and gentry since time immemorial and sometimes
gets repaid. <BR>
<BR>
<B>B</B>ob is persuasive, he takes me aside at this banking reception to
say farewell to Mr Sayonara or some such and asks if he can call in a favor,
he has this kinda wayward client who is in need of financial advice and
my name comes to mind. <BR>
<BR>
I figure at once who he means, on account NatWest is lead banker to Eurotunnel,
but Bob says no, not Alastair, he is really quite rational some of the time,
or least by comparison, Bob says, and keeps his account in good order, the
only trouble is his sums do not add up, what they do instead is multiply.
<BR>
<BR>
It appears Bob's problem client is a single parent, or semi-detached, who
is active in work for good causes that pay her expenses, but has to get
by on a small private income, which she supplements by writing children's
stories, about a poor little private jet called Chubbie, which has trouble
with its payload ratio, and gets into scrapes and almost crashes, but somehow
it bounces, or at least its checks do. <BR>
<BR>
All this never quite covers her outgoings, try as she may, she lives in
rented housing and buys her clothes in wholesale quantities and takes her
children on self-catering holidays in rural France, and also she makes major
cutbacks, she dispenses with her second manicurist and insists that her
dresser and tiara fly sub-sonic. <BR>
<BR>
At this Bob lowers his voice and explains to me about his client's mother-in-law,
who bails her out from time to time, tho' when the overdraft gets up into
the stratosphere, word of this leaks out into the blatts, maybe his client
breaks the habit of a lifetime and looks at her bank statement, but the
mother-in-law asks if she guarantees this account, and all she has to say
is: We are not amused. <BR>
<BR>
Well, of course, this brings down the creditors like missiles, ladies who
give our client money from the goodness of their heart now claim that these
are loans, and behind them come the caterers and hairdressers and tennis
professionals and other tradesmen, and the bank would not mind having some
of its money back too. <BR>
<BR>
Herbie, Bob murmurs, maybe she listens to you, she has American financial
advisors before now and they start her off on the right foot, just get us
out of this hole and we never forget it, and someone else does not forget
it either, you can expect a friendly gesture from the mother-in-law, in
time for New Year's Day. <BR>
<BR>
Mom, to an old hand like your boy this is like handing candy to a baby,
first of all we set up a corporation, with good wide articles, which issues
reams and reams of stock to this mystery client, and options, too, of course,
in exchange for exclusive rights to her services, or some of them, and also
rights in Chubbie, the loveable jet. <BR>
<BR>
Then we put the word around how Lear Jet is about to sponsor Chubbie, and
Disney is in an auction for the rights, bidding up against the guys from
Looney Tunes, and Andrew Lloyd Webber is working on <I>Chubbie: The Musical</I>,
plus all the usual merchandizing deals and personal promotional appearances,
and maybe here and there some kid actually buys the book and reads it, I
try this myself, it is not too demanding. <BR>
<BR>
On top of this a 24-carat no-brainer deal is now on offer in the markets,
this comes courtesy of the Banco Central do Bulimia, I pick the tale up
at the Comex dinner, all the traders there are bragging how much business
they do with this guy in South America, he sells them options on his country's
gold reserves, and between them they figure this Bulimian banker pledges
his reserves to each and all of them, a few times over. <BR>
<BR>
This is a good deal for him so long as the price of gold does not go up,
and since it falls into a haunted sleep some years ago this does not worry
him, and besides, if it wakens up he can always borrow some more gold and
sell it, and friendly Swiss banks stand by to help him out with this. <BR>
<BR>
Finance this imaginative does not get seen in the markets since Nick Leeson
goes on sabbatical, but if the Bulimian guy is this short, then the long
side is the side to be, I buy a few ingots for the Last National and they
perform very nicely, so the guy is obviously passing thru the wringer, now
the hedge funds come in I figure on selling to them but maybe I sell to
the Chubbie corporation. <BR>
<BR>
<B>T</B>hen we take it to Vancouver or some such undemanding stock exchange
and launch it on the world, it sells for zillions, I even ask Bob whether
his client's children's settlement is able to subscribe for stock, he says:
No, Granny had it drawn too tightly, good try tho' Herbie, he says. <BR>
<BR>
So I put all this in draft and take it down to Charing Cross, where Bob
operates this banking theme park, we both figure we have the solution but
we neither of us reckon with his client, she makes a personal promotional
appearance right there in the manager's office, to tell him how she and
some us advisors make a magic deal for her, worth megabucks, she says, so
stop being so tiresome and give me more money. <BR>
<BR>
Bob and I look at each other, I ask if he still has the billions he gets
for Bancorp, he says it does not all come in yet, Well, I say, when it does,
don't lend or spend it all at once, I figure you are going to need it, much
love from <BR>
<BR>
Your advisory son <BR>
<BR>
Herbie <BR>

Herbie is advised by Christopher Fildes <BR>

<HTML> <HEAD><TITLE>Emerging Markets </TITLE></HEAD> <BODY>


<H3> <B>Emerging Markets  </B> </H3> <P> <B>Edited by
Brian Caplen</B>

<H3> <B>RUSSIAN BONDS</B> </H3> <H3> <B>Greed is good for gekkos</B> </H3> <P>
The Thursday before the election they yielded 215%. One week later they yielded
130%. In July they breached 80%, before jumping to 94% one week later. At the
time of writing, the central bank had allowed them to come down to an average in
the low 80s. Welcome to the Russian government's domestic debt market, nicknamed
the gekko market after its abbrevation GKO.

<P> Not surprisingly, foreign investors have been desperate to get a piece of
this volatile, high-yield action. But so far the Russian government has not been
so keen to oblige, fearing only the hottest of money will arrive.

<P> Until president Boris Yetsin's re-election the government's one concession
was to offer a derivative product through Paris-based Eurobank. This guaranteed
dollar returns of 19%, which the government optimistically expected would bring
in foreign money to ease the cost of financing the government debt, the size of
which has grown from $13 billion at the beginning of the year to $36 billion in
July. Understandably, risk-hungry investors saw this as a little tame compared
with the real thing.

<P> The government's latest concession, post-election, will hardly whet their
enthusiasm either. The Russian authorities have set up a new investment account
called the "S" account. This means that investors can buy gekkos direct from a
Russian commercial bank &#173; rather than go through a derivative structure in
Paris. But it will still mean that while rouble gains will approach 80%, this
yield will be quartered after the central bank has stepped in. Gekko profits made
by foreigners will have to be converted into dollars using a three-month forward
rate which is set by the central bank. This will reduce the dollar return to 19%
&#173; so no change there.

<P> The next step, says Andrei Kozlov, the deputy governor of the central bank,
is to allow large foreign commercial banks to become official dealers using
remote terminals in Frankfurt, London, Paris and New York. He adds that with the
planned launch of a Eurobond this autumn, it is not in the interest of the
government to allow foreigners in on equal terms with domestic players.
Otherwise, many foreign investors will just buy gekkos rather than the Eurobond.

<P> But the full-scale opening of the gekko market is less likely to be
frustrated by this sideshow in the international capital markets than by the
Russian banking system's need to keep it closed. Russia's debt market is
constructed as a means of supporting the profitability of Russia's 2,000 banks,
many of them spurious, by offering them tremendous yields of around 80%, at a
time when the monthly inflation rate was 1.2% in June.

<P> To foreign investors the legal purchase of pure gekkos with full dollar
convertibility represents something of a holy grail, especially now that
Yeltsin's new term has been confirmed. Investors know that the default risk on
gekkos is non-existent.

<P> There is also very little chance of mass devaluations sapping yield gains
(Kozlov's forward rate aside). The currency showed itself to be remarkably
resilient, even through the elections, and the government has set a target of
devaluing by only 1.5% per month.

<P> So it should come as no surprise that investors have paid rapt attention
every time a western bank has mentioned a scheme to get around the rules and let
them invest directly. Unfortunately very few of these schemes obey the letter of
the law and even those that are cleverly structured contravene its spirit.

<P> "The structures are grey at best," confesses a Moscow-based trader.
Typically, an investment company will be set up in Cyprus, which has a
double-taxation treaty with Russia. Cyprus does not, however, make you any less
foreign, just very tax-efficient. A standard tax rate of 4.25% is paid to the
Cypriot authorities on monies channelled tax-free from investments in Russia.

<P> The first thing is to get the dollars into Russia. This tends to be done with
the help of a Russian financial intermediary which has a subsidiary branch abroad
and at which you deposit the dollars. This bank then brings the funds onshore and
buys the gekkos (for a fee). The problem arises, however, when the investment
company's auditors discover it has no physical ownership of the gekkos. Kozlov
says he wants to encourage intermediaries to push their clients into legal
schemes and he says he knows on which doors to knock. "We may punish
intermediaries in the autumn. But we will not punish foreign investors, only the
intermediary," warns Kozlov.

<P> The only apparent alternative to the illegal schemes is offered by Regent and
ANZ bank which set up a closed-end gekko fund of $106 million in July. They had
the foresight to start setting up a Russian company in April, long before the
result of the election was a foregone conclusion and nearly four months later,
the company is operational. As a result, it can invest as a domestic investor.

<H3> <B>THAILAND</B> </H3> <H3> <B>Bumper money from Thai traffic</B> </H3> <P>
More than 600 new cars hit the traffic-choked streets of Bangkok every day. And
ING Barings is banking on the fact that there is very little the Thai government
can do to stall the onslaught.

<P> Jim France is based in Hong Kong, but his structured finance team at ING
Barings has put together what they are claiming is the largest international
securitization from an Asian issuer &#173; floating-rate notes backed by Thai
auto-lease receivables.

<P> The originators of the leases are Thai companies Tru-Way, which offers hire
purchase for luxury imported cars, and TISCO Leasing, which provides leasing
finance for similar cars, as well as for office equipment.

<P> After months of fine-tuning the Thai Cars structure, ING Barings finally
received the nod from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's on the triple-A rating
requirements and from US specialist insurer MBIA Insurance before launching at
the end of July. The deal raised $250 million on underlying leases of $310
million. The floating-rate notes were issued at par with a margin of 22 basis
points over three-month US dollar Libor payable quarterly in arrears.

<P> France says the deal was well oversubscribed, with most interest from
European banks. The notes were issued by the Cayman Islands-registered Thai Cars
special purpose vehicle and are being listed in Luxembourg. They have an expected
average life of 1.5 years, a final maturity of six years and an expected final
maturity of three to three-and-a-half years. The notes were not offered in
Thailand.

<P> The issues faced by the arrangers were numerous and complex, as would be
expected in the first such international deal from the Thai jurisdiction. The tax
and legal considerations had to be considered in tandem with the country's
macroeconomic issues, but on top of that, Bangkok's horrendous traffic situation
was also a factor in structuring and selling the paper.

<P> As the congestion worsens, the Thai government is being forced to address its
traffic issues. Bangkok's deputy prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, dubbed the
city's "traffic tzar" for his pledge to solve the urban nightmare, has threatened
to ban new cars completely on some roads during peak hours.

<P> But future legislation should not effect the transaction because there will
be no substitution in the existing pool of car loans, argues France.

<P> "Even though the government wants to reduce vehicles on the road, it probably
won't be that successful in terms of preventing people from buying new cars," he
says. For example, drivers could switch registration plates from their old cars
on to their new ones to circumvent any new restrictions.

<P> Nevertheless, any serious clampdown on new cars, coupled with the country's
inflation worries, could put pressure on leasing companies such as TISCO Leasing
and Tru-Way.

<P> The history of the deal goes back over a year when Tru-Way was working with
Bankers Trust to put together a $75 million structured loan collateralized by the
hire purchase contracts. But the deal took longer than anticipated, the costs
were higher than expected and Tru-Way felt the deal was not really big enough to
satisfy its funding objectives.

<P> At that point ING Barings stepped in with a proposal for a full-scale
securitization and was mandated in February, initially putting in place a $75
million bridging facility using the same structure as the securitization, which
has now become a public FRN issue incorporating TISCO Leasing assets as well.

<P> Thai withholding tax of 15% led to the use of a fixed-rate yen loan<B> </B>to
on-lend the proceeds of the dollar notes from Thai Cars to an intermediate Thai
company, Tru-Lease, which is assigned rights and interest over the underlying
hire purchase and lease payments, which remain on the originators' balance
sheets. The lower absolute interest rate on yen loans meant such a structure was
the best way of minimizing withholding tax.

<P> Tru-Lease will then on-lend the proceeds by buying baht-denominated notes
from TISCO Leasing and Tru-Way.

<P> After Tru-Lease has been in existence six months, in November, the baht notes
will be redeemed and replaced by a baht loan. The baht notes and loan carry a
fixed coupon, payable monthly and are cross-guaranteed by TISCO Leasing and
Tru-Way. This mechanism avoids the baht loan incurring a 3.3% specific business
tax on lending by companies which are not banks or approved finance businesses.
Related parties are exempt from the tax if the affiliates have been in existence
for six months.

<P> The legal status of securitization in Thailand was also a hurdle. "The
reaction we kept hearing was that it couldn't be done," says France. The main
issue was to ensure there was clear legal transfer of the rights to the
receivables underlying the hire purchase and lease contracts. ING Barings also
had to structure the transaction to ensure bankruptcy of either of the
originators would not prejudice payments to investors.

<P> When ING Barings started marketing to companies in Thailand, it met with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and Bank of Thailand, but they are still some
way off producing final guidelines for domestic securitization. However, they
were keen to encourage an offshore deal.

<P> Such offshore structures are likely to remain, even once a domestic framework
is in place, because of the limited local appetite for such paper and the
government restrictions on lending to such businesses.

<H3> <B>ASIAN CAPITAL MARKETS</B> </H3> <H3> <B>The battle for Asia</B> </H3> <P>
John Howland-Jackson, deputy chief executive of NatWest Markets, will be posted
to Hong Kong next month. He is only the most recent (and probably the most
senior) of a stream of top executives sent out to run their firms' Asian
operations in the past few months. He joins, among others, John McNiven, former
head of European debt markets for Merrill Lynch, and Dan Tyree, former chairman
of Lehman Europe. What's the sudden attraction of Asia?

<P> The truth is that a battle is raging to dominate the fast-growing Asian
capital markets. The US market is dominated by, arguably, six or seven firms; the
top tier in Europe probably comprises 12 to 15. But Asia is still wide open: as
many as 25 firms can justifiably call themselves leading players. These range
from the big US investment banks to British banks (Schroders, BZW) to European
universal banks (notably Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and ING Barings) and to local
firms (Jardine Fleming, Peregrine). Says Howland-Jackson: "The fact is that no
investment bank owns the region. Outside Japan, there are no domestic firms which
have a monopoly. And maybe nobody will ever own Asia like they own the US or
Europe."

<P> An analysis of league tables and polls shows just how wide open the field is.
The table on the previous page demonstrates the fragmented nature of the
business. Jardine Fleming, for example, dominates convertible issues from Asia
but hasn't led a straight bond issue in the past 18 months. Nomura has won lots
of bond mandates, but few equity ones. Perhaps only Morgan Stanley and Lehman can
be said to have a stong presence across the board. Add equity research to the
equation and the ranking changes again. As the Asian brokers survey in this issue
shows (see page 90), institutions which invest in the region go to a different
set of firms for their research: Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Securities Asia, Crosby
and James Capel all figure prominently in the research poll, but come nowhere in
capital markets business. Only Jardine Fleming, ING Barings and Merrill Lynch are
strong in both the primary and secondary categories.

<P> Stirring up the competition is the fact that the nature of the business in
Asia is changing. Until now, it has been possible to make good profits from
equity broking in Asia. Jardine Fleming and Barings built up costly Asia-wide
networks of branches and equity analysts which still generate lucrative business
purely from stockbroking. But some bankers believe that, as fixed commissions
disappear, the margins that can be made from straight broking will narrow. The
brokers will then have to develop capital markets (for example, new issues)
business to make those networks pay their way.

<P> A further problem is that both JF and Barings are going through difficult
times. Baring's merger with ING still seems to have unsettled the firm's Asian
operations. JF has been the subject of an investigation by the UK's Investment
Management Regulatory Organization for allegedly allowing unethical practices by
its fund managers. Its relations with Robert Fleming, its London-based
half-owner, are said to be difficult. Rumours in Asia suggest the firm (and some
of the other locally founded independent houses) may be up for sale.

<P> Investment banks in Asia planning their strategy face several dilemmas.
Should they try to build a pan-Asian network or instead concentrate on two or
three major centres? Goldman Sachs, after some dithering, has rooted for the
second option. It concentrates on big-ticket capital markets deals, its research
is focused on pan-Asian sectors and written by analysts in Hong Kong and
Singapore, and it is developing niches in private banking and direct investment.
For firms that decide to build a network, problems abound. In many countries
&#173; notably Indonesia and Thailand &#173; foreign firms are by law required to
bring in a local partner. Finding the right partner and maintaining that
relationship is invariably difficult.

<P> Who to hire to head your Asian operation is equally a dilemma. While NatWest
and others have opted to send a senior executive from London, others have decided
to find a well-connected local. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, for example, appointed
Simon Murray, former managing director of conglomerate Hutchison and a resident
of Hong Kong since 1966, to run its Asian operation. BZW's Asian chairman, John
Richardson, was also formerly with Hutchison.

<P> Which firms are likely to emerge victorious from the battle? Much will depend
on how quickly the domestic markets in the region liberalize. If they remain
closed and fail to restructure, the firms with operations on the ground will be
at an advantage. But if Asian governments understand the need to attract more
foreign capital to fund infrastructure projects, it is more likely that the big
global firms will emerge the winners.

<H3> <B>KAZAKHSTAN</B> </H3> <H3> <B>Gulf state on the Black Sea</B> </H3> <P>
Kazakhstan's president Nursultan Nazarbayev apparently enjoys the many pleasures
available during his regular trips abroad in the company of foreign government
officials and businessmen. This autumn, however, it is the attractions of his own
country which will be paraded in front of international investors, when ABN Amro
launches Kazakhstan's inaugural Eurobond issue.

<P> The Dutch bank won the mandate in June against competition from 17 rivals,
helped no doubt by its presence, for the last two years, in the capital Almaty,
as the only fully licensed foreign bank in Kazakhstan. According to Noman
Siddiqui, head of structured finance and commercial banking for ABN Amro in
Almaty, the oil-rich former Soviet republic is likely to raise $100 million with
a three-year maturity in November. ABN will first act as a rating adviser and
coordinate presentations to the three main agencies in September or October.
Other sources at the bank reckon Romania's recent BB minus rating should provide
a guide, while the market's early talk suggests pricing between 400 basis points
and 450bp over Libor, which was where Lithuania issued last year.

<P> Investors will be encouraged by the resolution of a four-year dispute between
Kazakhstan, Russia and Oman over their participation in the Caspian pipeline
consortium. They now need to be convinced that the pipeline, connecting the
Tengiz oilfield to the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea, will
actually be built. Its cost is estimated at $1.5 billion and will be met by eight
international oil companies: the first delivery of oil is expected to be made in
1998. But, as 300 delegates heard at a conference promoting Kazakhstan, organized
by London's Adam Smith Institute at the beginning of July, the country
experiences problems common to other CIS states &#173; an unreliable and
untrustworthy government bureaucracy, and a poorly developed infrastructure.

<P> ABN will hope to side-step such concerns by focusing on the country's
potential as a putative "Gulf state", containing vast oil and gas reserves &#173;
the Tengiz field contains 800 million tons of extractable oil reserves. Last year
inward investment flows to Kazakhstan increased 38% to $2.6 billion, with nearly
half directed to the mining sector (predominantly oil and gas), which has taken
90% of the total since 1991, according to figures published by the UN Economic
Commission for Europe. Mobil's intention to buy half the government's stake in
the Tengiz field for $1.1 billion and the interest shown by other US oil
companies in different fields suggest the increasing trend will continue this
year. Says ABN's Siddiqui: "Kazakhstan has tremendous potential and the risk
profile of the region as a whole is improving. The issue of a Eurobond will raise
the country's profile even more."

<P> UBS forecasts 2% growth this year, rising to 4% in 1997, and points out that
a likely decline in the annualized inflation rate to 43% this year will mean
that<BR> Kazakhstan has one of the lowest inflation rates in the CIS.

<P> Capital markets, however, are still embryonic; a stock exchange with listed
shares exists but they are not actively traded. Treasury bills for three and six
months are available, but that is the extent of the debt market.

<P> But the financial sector is starting to develop. Peter Phelps moved from the
Moscow office of Framlington Asset Management in August 1995 to run Kazakhstan's
first investment bank called Global Kazkommerts Securities. It is a joint venture
between the country's largest private bank, Kazkommertsbank (which holds a stake
in ABN Amro in Almaty, along with the IFC) and the Turkish Global Securities
investment company. Already it has advised the government on the privatization of
Kazakhstan Telecom and raised finance for Coca-Cola's Almaty bottling factory,
and acted for several companies in acquisitions in the food processing and
brewing sectors. Peter Phelps is enthusiastic about his move: "Kazakhstan is more
centralized and considerably more stable than Russia," he says.

<H3>GLOBAL CUSTODY </H3>
<H2>Shackling the custodians</H2>
<H4>The Maxwell and Baring scandals turned the spotlight on the relative
freedoms enjoyed in the UK by global custodians. Now tighter regulation
is in prospect, heralding a further contraction in the industry as compliance
costs bite. <BR>
Nick Kochan reports </H4>
Global custodians are becoming nervous. For the last six months they have
been making representations to the UK Securities &amp; Investments Board
about its demands for tougher regulation following the Barings and Maxwell
affairs. Now they must await the SIB's findings to discover the form of
regulation likely to be demanded. <BR>
<BR>
The industry accepts that some form of regulation is virtually inevitable.
&quot;The odds are better than even that we will become a regulated industry,&quot;
says Mike Devine, director of securities services at Royal Bank of Scotland
(RBS). &quot;I am convinced it will happen,&quot; agrees James Economides,
custody director at Citibank. &quot;But we support it. We have decent internal
controls and we are regulated by every authority round the world, so it
is very unlikely someone is going to come to us and say that more controls
are needed.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
As part of its initial guidelines for regulation, the SIB indicated three
categories where tougher rules might apply. First, it proposed to enhance
regulatory standards for custody providers; second, it flew a kite for tighter
segregation of customer investments from those of the firm; third, it expressed
a &quot;provisional view&quot; that the law should be changed to require
custodians to be authorized. <BR>
<BR>
The SIB appears confident that it can push through the first two categories
of regulation, but a spokeswoman was less confident about implementing the
third. Authorization under the act is &quot;probably the most contentious
part&quot;, she says. &quot;It is most likely to cause problems and difficulties
because it might require changes in law. It is not as straightforward as
it might appear.&quot; The doubts now surfacing may suggest that the custody
industry will receive fairly lenient constraints when the SIB eventually
reports. <BR>
<BR>
This will be in line with the view taken by professor Roy Goode after the
Maxwell debacle in which the late Robert Maxwell was found to have been
raiding his employees' pension fund to support his business empire. In his
report Goode advised that pension fund trustees only review their custody
and investment arrangements to see if segregation was appropriate. Those
demanding tougher controls were disappointed, says Citibank's Economides.
&quot;Some people were hoping that there would be more onerous restrictions
to safeguard the interests of the beneficial owners.&quot; Terry McCaughey,
the director of Midland Securities Services, puts it much more strongly:
&quot;From a custodian's perspective the Goode committee didn't go far enough.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
McCaughey believes the regulators should now act to impose strict segregation.
He argues that fund managers should be required to segregate investments
owned by the firm from those they are managing for customers. &quot;If you
are dealing with a fund manager with pooled funds, how do you know what's
yours? If a bank's nominee holds your shares together with the bank's own
shares, you have to rely on their definitive record to identify ownership.
And if trouble arises, who's to say that the liquidator will not take possession
of the whole lot?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Deposits of cash are particularly at risk when a pooling system is in operation,
says McCaughey. &quot;In most cases, you can segregate your securities from
those of the beneficial owner. But cash is fungible, and that makes it difficult
to protect yourself if the bank goes belly up and a liquidator comes in.
I don't think everyone has quite understood the lessons of Barings.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The concern for protecting cash is also shared by Economides, who saw the
Barings debacle at first hand - Citibank was a custodian for Baring
unit trusts. &quot;None of the underlying unit holders had a problem, as
the securities were controlled by trustees. But those institutional investors
with cash and assets with Barings found that their cash was not safe as
it was on the books of Barings when the bank hit the rocks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
While the custodian cannot provide fullproof protection against fraud, McCaughey
argues that the separation of fund manager and custodian will give comfort
to the pension fund trustee anxious about the security of his investment.
The three-way reconciliation between fund manager and custodian, custodian
and customer, and fund manager and customer provides a check and balance
on abuse in any of the three parties. &quot;A pension fund trustee looking
at two sets of records should have some comfort that there is a clear segregation
of duties and responsibility,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Super-league custodians</B> <BR>
<BR>
The expected arrival of tougher regulation will undoubtedly speed up the
current consolidation in the custody industry, says Economides. The contraction,
spurred by the cost of compliance and advances in technology, began in earnest
in the middle of last year when such stalwarts of the industry as JP Morgan,
Bank of America, Nations Trust, US Trust and National Westminster announced
they were selling their operations. The first three portfolios were picked
up by the fast-growing Bank of New York, while the latter two were bought
by Chase Manhattan and Lloyds. <BR>
<BR>
The contraction has probably not stopped. Observers believe that within
five years most British custodian tasks will be controlled by a handful
of highly rated American and British commercial banks. <BR>
<BR>
The greatest force for consolidation and outsourcing is the cost of entry
and the cost of technology needed to stay up with the leaders. &quot;The
investment hurdle in global custody is rising year-on-year,&quot; says Devine
of RBS. Citibank's Economides expects the industry to segregate into five
big global players, a tier of medium-sized regional players, and some specialist
operators. As much as 80% of custody assets could now settle with one-fifth
of the banks, claims one contender. <BR>
<BR>
Two of the banks in the top tier are not in doubt. Citibank and Chase have
wider global networks than any other banks and they have led the field in
service and technology developments. Other contenders for the top slot are
harder to guess. Deutsche Bank, for example, is making a play and ABN Amro
is sometimes tipped as a bank with custody staying power. Midland Securities
Services is also bidding for a place, although its move to prominence is
recent. Midland made the leap to global status following its acquisition
by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank. <BR>
<BR>
With HSBC came one of custody's brightest sparks, New Zealander McCaughey.
As he reorganized the custody operation on geographical rather than functional
lines, costs and fail rates fell and productivity rose. The bank has pursued
business aggressively and McCaughey now calculates it has &#163;300 billion
of assets against &#163;40 billion three years ago. &quot;This is a spectacular
growth rate and we have to make sure we keep the wheels on the trolley,&quot;
he says, admitting that there have been hiccups along the way. <BR>
<BR>
Over the last three years the global content of Midland's portfolio has
climbed from a quarter to over a third, but McCaughey is adamant it has
achieved this expansion without tapping the strong east Asian franchise
controlled by HSBC. As sub-custodian to a number of major global custodians,
HSBC cannot offer preferential terms to Midland without jeopardizing its
existing businesses, he says. &quot;Midland Security Services gets no preferential
treatment from HSBC group's Asian securities operations by being a member
of the group. As soon as they start offering me concessions, it would be
goodbye to a number of their clients. We run completely separate operations.&quot;
It is possible that once the industry has consolidated still further, the
two operations may combine their strengths and trade under a single global
operation. Midland received a considerable fillip earlier in the year when
it took over Prudential's massive investment portfolio. <BR>
<BR>
The consolidation at the top has opened up larger niches for specialist
providers in geographical or product areas which do not offer the returns
demanded by the majors. Northern Trust, for example, has built up a loyal
pension fund clientele on both sides of the Atlantic, and Brown Brothers
Harriman has created a niche in the custody of private banking assets. <BR>
<BR>
Royal Bank of Scotland has built up a leading regional position in Europe
by spending heavily on technology. Devine says a four-year investment programme,
investing &#163;30 million in communications technology, has just been completed.
The bank went on the acquisition trail recently with its purchase of NatWest's
registration arm. <BR>
<BR>
Another set of custody players snapping at the heels of the majors are the
central securities depositories (CSDs). They have sharpened up their act
in line with the suggestions of a paper JP Morgan produced two years ago
which recommended that CSDs improve their efficiency and provide custody
services. Now those institutions are taking on the individual banks by offering
a plain, core service. <BR>
<BR>
McCaughey emphasizes the limitations of the CSDs. &quot;If everybody had
the same disciplines and accounting systems then you could offer a stock
product. But if you are running a very complex derivatives book, with multi-currency
exposure and stock lending, then this will not be helpful.&quot; According
to one custodian, the impact on the industry of leading CSD Cedel was likely
to be muted because of its ownership structure. Cedel is owned by the banks
themselves. &quot;The banks are not going to let them get into industries
that will hurt them,&quot; the custodian said. The European banks in particular
have a very strong say in the running of Cedel. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fees bottom out</B> <BR>
<BR>
As the industry settles down to consolidation and restructuring, fees and
commissions have started to bottom out. Prices of standard custody services
dropped by 15% a year over the last five years as competition intensified.
Now the decline is a more manageable 7% to 8% a year, says Economides. McCaughey
is even more bullish, arguing that prices are no longer falling and in certain
markets may &quot;ever so slightly be ticking back again&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
McCaughey says custody providers have stopped giving away the service as
a loss leader for other banking products. This is confirmed by Paul Molloy,
a vice-president at Chase, who argues that &quot;with the industry's consolidation,
the need to take on loss leaders is not quite so pressing. Although there
are plenty of competitors, no-one offers custody for free any more. Customers
are beginning to realize there is an irreducible minimum.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Yet bankers complain some custody prices are still remarkably low. For example,
custody of UK assets for a UK institution may be no more than 0.2 basis
points, making the price of a trade &#163;8 to &#163;10. &quot;It's sometimes
not worth producing the invoice,&quot; says a custodian. <BR>
<BR>
However, the economics are complicated by fees for services that go with
custody, such as stock lending and portfolio valuation. &quot;If you rely
on custody, you cannot survive,&quot; says Devine. &quot;You make money
on cash balances. That's why you have to get into value-added products.&quot;
He says RBS is seeking to differentiate the product mix. &quot;We tell clients:
'If you want more, you have to pay more'.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In fact, guaranteed lending income often offsets a superficially low price
for basic custody services, and complex custody accounts still yield 30
basis points or more even today. Paper-based clients - and there are
still plenty of them in London - will always have to pay more than
that. Most UK custodians are seeking between 60 bp and 80bp for a middle-sized
UK portfolio. In emerging markets, between 30bp and 40bp is routine, and
some markets, such as India, yield exceptionally high returns. Only a handful
of custodians are serious contenders in these markets, and although competition
is increasing, especially in Latin America, margins as yet are not seriously
being eroded. <BR>
<BR>
As the number of providers of full-service custody diminishes, the amount
of business is growing. The mushrooming of mutual funds and pension funds
on both sides of the Atlantic - said to have grown by $50 billion over
the last six years alone - has provided an unprecedented wall of money
for the custodians and the fund management industry. <BR>
<BR>
Even some of the largest mutual fund managers and pension funds now want
to rid themselves of the problems and difficulties of custody. Hence the
decision of the Prudential, the UK's largest industrial life assurance company,
to send its custody businesses outside to its house bank, Midland, whose
securities services teamed up for the deal with Mellon Bank and Trust. <BR>
<BR>
Other notable instances of outsourcing in the last year have included leading
London fund manager Henderson Administration, which awarded a &#163;7 billion
custody account to Royal Bank of Scotland Securities Services. Pharmaceuticals
company Zeneca and chemicals group ICI handed control of their pension administration
to Chase Manhattan and Midland Securities Services, respectively. <BR>
<BR>
The rising infrastructural costs associated with the failed London Stock
Exchange Taurus electronic clearing system and with its successor, Crest,
have pushed funds to outsource investment services, says Devine. The cost
of installing an interface with Crest is between &#163;250,000 and &#163;500,000,
and efficient use of the new technology requires retraining of staff. &quot;Crest
has been a catalyst for outsourcing,&quot; says Devine. <BR>
<BR>
Changes in the industry now force the question: Where is the limit to growth?
&quot;Are there limits to the economies of scale?&quot; asks one custodian.
&quot;How big is big?&quot; He concludes that investment in technology will
proceed so long as margins sustain it. That should mean that the survivors
will find the rewards huge; those that fail will lose their shirts and regret
they ever started. <BR>

<H3>Western Europe</H3>
<B>Best Bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank was top of the <I>Euromoney </I>forex poll in May, for the 18th
consecutive year. Citibank is represented in every western European country,
with 500 branches, 1,000 offices and 13,000 employees. The bank's revenue
for 1995 was $3.5 billion and it has assets of $256.8 billion. With a presence
in corporate, consumer and private banking as well as dominance in foreign
exchange - especially in the emerging market currencies - it is
difficult to look beyond Citibank for this award. It is the strongest of
the foreign banks in at least three western European countries, and with
a growing strength in the old eastern bloc countries, Citi is still the
institution that can best lay claim to being a truly pan-European force
in banking. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>SBC Warburg </I><BR>
<BR>
SBC Warburg ranks top in <I>Euromoney's</I> European brokers' poll, for
pan-European equity research. Warburg was always highly regarded for its
research skills, but until the merger, was possibly lacking in execution
skills and this was reflected in <I>Euromoney's </I>polls. SBC brought the
trading skill and capital that Warburg was lacking, and together, the two
institutions make a good combination. The merger has been costly in financial
terms, but seems to be continuing to work well. <BR>
<BR>
SBC Warburg was top of May's <I>Euromoney</I> unweighted Eurobond trading
poll and was also the bookrunner for the largest percentage share of Eurobond
issues - 5.95% worth $24.63 billion - since our last awards. <HR>
<h4><A NAME="eeurope"></A<H3>Eastern Europe </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>ING </I><BR>
<BR>
ING won best foreign bank in Poland, Russia and Slovakia, and is widely
represented throughout the area, with offices from the Baltic to the Black
Sea. It is the largest foreign financial services employer in the region
and is particularly strong in Poland where it was the first foreign bank
to receive a banking licence. In 1995 ING acquired holdings in Bank Slaski
and Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy (BPH). It remains innovative: it was the first
bank in Poland to perform a zloty currency swap. <BR>
<BR>
ING is diversified in its activities as well as its coverage. In Hungary,
where it has acted on behalf of McDonald's with a three-year debt issue,
it is the only foreign bank to have a retail commitment as well as a corporate
banking presence. It is the also largest issuer of commercial paper in the
country, a Ft15 billion ($120 million) programme. <BR>
<BR>
In the Slovak republic, ING is the only foreign bank with representation
outside the capital, in Kosice. ING was the first bank for 20 years to open
a branch in Romania. ING's diversification and coverage are the key to this
award. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>Creditanstalt</I> <BR>
<BR>
A broad geographical spread within the region gives Creditanstalt the edge
over its competitors. The bank does not cover Africa or South America, and
so its efforts are concentrated on central and eastern Europe - the
only niche market in which it is involved. Creditanstalt's strategy is one
of expansion, with $200 million invested over the last five years. It has
a combined total of 1,600 employees in the region and claims to offer the
widest range of services of any foreign-owned institution: investment-banking,
commercial banking and corporate finance work. The investment banking subsidiaries
in Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak Republics are particularly strong.
<BR>
<BR>
In January 1996, the Czech privatization fund run by Creditanstalt was sold
to Czech Agrobank. The fund was the first of its kind in the Czech republic
and, at the time, held stock in 130 companies. <BR>
<BR>
In the first five months of 1996, Creditanstalt AG's operating profits grew
by 40% to $241.3 million - in no small part due to its strength in
the eastern European capital markets. The Austrian government is hoping
to sell its 70% stake in Creditanstalt in the near future and Creditanstalt's
strength in the eastern European capital markets must be one of the factors
that will attract potential buyers. <HR>
<H4><A NAME="asia"></A></H4>

<H3>Asia </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank's presence in the Asia-Pacific region is the most extensive and
the most profitable of any financial institution. With Asia generating $2.7
billion of revenues and $781 million of net income in 1995, Citibank has
already achieved what most banks can only aspire to in terms of truly globalizing
its operations. A 90-year history in Asia has helped to cement key relationships
at government and corporate levels, while its localization policy -
with 97% of its 15,000 staff being local hires - allows it to present
a genuine Asian face. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>ING</I> <BR>
<BR>
Those who wrote off Barings in the aftermath of Leeson apparently spoke
too soon. Still the best at research-led stockbroking in Asia, it has leveraged
off its extensive branch network throughout the region to increase turnover
and profitability. It has similarly lost none of its vim in equity capital
markets and finished creditably high in the league tables in what was a
difficult year for all. The merger with ING has proved surprisingly painless
with most key personnel so far remaining on board. <HR>
<H4><A NAME="lamerica"></A></h4>

<h3>Latin America </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank is the closest thing there is to a regional Latin American bank.
It has been in the region more than 80 years and operates in 22 countries,
where it employs nearly 12,000 people in 152 branches. It serves about 4,700
corporate clients and 4 million retail accounts. In most of these countries
it is perceived to be the brand leader. No other bank in the region has
comparable coverage, depth of experience or breadth of relationships. <BR>
<BR>
Citibank's strength is based partly on its long history in the region, where
US multinationals are major investors, partly on preferential treatment
- in some countries it was the only foreign bank allowed to operate
until recent liberalization. It is also based on a policy of local recruitment
and promotion (attracting talented people); an impressive network of business
and government contacts; a reputation for safety, efficiency and discretion
and an ability to exploit rapidly changing local conditions, from volatile
economic and financial trends to complex tax, legal and regulatory developments.

<H4><A NAME="africa"></A></h4><H3>Africa </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank remains pre-eminent in Africa, mainly because it is the only bank
which shows continued commitment to the whole region. From north to south
of the continent, the bank is strengthening its hand, whether it be through
hiring a greater number of employees in Tunisia or by its commitment to
opening an office in Angola in 1996 (scheduled for July). Citibank has also
opened an office in Tanzania. Such pioneering work in the less developed
- or completely undeveloped - markets of the continent is a Citibank
hallmark. However, its grip on the more sophisticated markets in Africa
also remains strong. This was demonstrated by the roles Citibank played
in the privatization of Kenyan Airways. It was domestic adviser to the Kenyan
government and global coordinator of the whole issue, which was Kenya's
most successful ever. 
<H4><A NAME="meast"></A></h4>

<h3>Middle East </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank's dominance of the forex market in Bahrain is the key to its Middle
Eastern operation, the most extensive of any bank's. The opening of Citibank
Islamic bank, exclusively geared to Islamic investment and meeting Islamic
investors' requirements, is typical of Citibank in the Middle East. Even
in countries with no private foreign banking presence, such as Saudi Arabia,
Citibank has a 30% stake in the Saudi American bank which is ru under a
management contract by Citicorp. A Citibank representative office in Algeria
is further evidence of exactly how far the Citibank tentacles reach in the
area. <BR>
<BR>
Once again, the key to the regional awards is the breadth and depth of a
bank's regional coverage, and in this department, Citibank can't be touched.

<H4><A NAME="europea"></A>Austria </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Bank Austria </I><BR>
<BR>
In 1995 Bank Austria's net income totalled Sch2.2 billion ($212.4 million)
and net profits were Sch658 million ($63.4 million). Both figures are an
improvement on 1994's performance. It is the largest of the Austrian banks
by equity, and its hand has been strengthened further by a strategic alliance
with WestLB, signed in April 1996. Germany's third largest bank, which now
holds a 9.1% stake in Bank Austria, will ensure a much stronger position
for Austria's premier bank in south-east Asia and the Pacific, where previously
they had been weak. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm</B> <I>Bank Austria</I> <BR>
<BR>
Bank Austria maintains a tight grip on the Austrian equity market, continuing
to arrange over 50% of primary equity issues. It is also significantly ahead
of all rivals in co-lead manager roles in flotations, with the help of the
group-affiliated GiroCredit clearing bank. Bank Austria came top in equity
research and equity execution for Austria in<I> Euromoney's</I> European
broker's poll last November. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Deutsche Bank Austria</I> <BR>
<BR>
Deutsche Bank Austria continues to lead the league table of foreign banks
in trading Austrian schilling bond issues and is well enough thought of
to be used by the Austrian government as an adviser on debt issues. 
<H4><A NAME="europeb"></A>Belgium </H4>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>Generale Bank </I><BR>
<BR>
The biggest bank in Belgium has pursued business aggressively this year,
leading some analysts to suggest that its competitors are continuing to
lose market share to it. Generale<I> </I>Bank comfortably won this May's
<I>Euromoney</I> government bond traders poll but the recent recruitment
of additional equity-related staff suggests the bank believes equities will
become increasingly important this year. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm</B> <I>Petercam</I> <BR>
<BR>
Petercam has an unrivalled knowledge of Belgian institutions and instruments.
It headed the table for equity research, equity execution and economic research
for Belgium in the <I>Euromoney </I>European brokers poll last November.
The firm has consistently handled the largest volume of business on the
Brussels stock exchange and is developing its bond-trading operation. The
firm's management is now planning an evolution to bank status. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>JP Morgan </I><BR>
<BR>
JP Morgan has had a presence in Belgium for 76 years. Including the Euroclear
operation which JPM invented and now runs under contract, it has over 1,000
employees there. It is a primary Belgian government bond dealer and further
bolstered its fine reputation for M&amp;A by successfully advising Tele
Danmark during the $2.5 billion Belgacom flotation.
<H4>Bulgaria </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Bulbank </I><BR>
<BR>
Stoyan Alexandrov, president of Central Cooperative Bank and former finance
minister, told Euromoney's <I>Central European </I>magazine this year: &quot;Of
the 44 banks in Bulgaria, I would trust only six.&quot; Five of those are
western. Bulbank (Foreign Trade Bank) is the one Bulgarian bank of any international
standing. In 1995 it continued to pursue a cautious but successful expansion
and a restricted investment policy, with end of year profits of Lev3.1 billion
($45.5 million). Bulbank has representative offices in London, Frankfurt
and Vienna, and owns 97% of Litex Bank in Lebanon, which it is soon to sell.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Raiffeisen Bank Bulgaria</I> <BR>
<BR>
Austrian Raiffeissen Zentralbank's operation in Bulgaria is the main channel
for all foreign - not just from Austrian - investment. Raiffeisen
also continues to increase its share of the Bulgarian domestic market, as
it has done each year since 1989 when it became the first western-based
bank to open there. <HR>
<H3><A NAME="europec"></A>Czech Republic </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Komercni Banka</I> <BR>
<BR>
Komercni is well funded and has a strong branch network. In a sector heavily
affected by bad debt, it has been able to keep its bad-loan provision low.
It has total reserves of Kr28.5 billion ($1.06 billion) and is considered
aggressive: &quot;It's the only domestic bank that I lose business to,&quot;
says one US banker. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm</B> <I>Atlantik Finanhi</I> <BR>
<BR>
When market participants were asked by <I>Euromoney</I> to name the Czech
broker that provided the best service, Brno-based Atlantik was mentioned
most often. There is not much competition in terms of efficiency and reliability
from other domestic brokers but Atlantik is bigger than foreign brokers
as well, with a turnover of Kr28 billion ($1.04 billion) in 1995. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank's most notable achievement over the last year was the placement
of commercial paper for Coca-Cola, the first multi-national to borrow in
the Czech market. Citibank came top in the <I>Euromoney</I> foreign exchange
poll for Czech koruna trading, in May.
<H4><A NAME="europed"></A>Denmark </H4>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>Den Danske Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Den Danske has emerged from its restructuring even stronger than before,
boasting profits for 1995 of $654 million, nearly double those of its nearest
competitor. Its return on average equity was 17.5%, again the best figure
for any of the top seven banks. In April the bank was global coordinator
for the largest Danish privatization of 1996 - that of Copenhagen Airport,
worth Dkr1.0885 billion ($188 million). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm</B> <I>Den Danske Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Den Danske was not as dominant in this year's <I>Euromoney</I> bond-trading
poll (published in May) as it was in last year's, but still remains on top.
Den Danske topped the five-year Copenhagen Stock Exchange share issue league
table, and, in June, brought Tryg Baltica, the largest Danish insurance
company, to the market. The company was valued at Dkr1.2 billion ($207 million).

<H4><A NAME="europef"></A>Finland </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Merita</I> <BR>
<BR>
Merita, the product of a merger between Union Bank of Finland (last year's
winner) and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, is Finland's largest bank and the third
largest in Scandinavia. In size and product range, Merita is vastly superior
to its competitors, and well placed to consolidate its position in an overbranched
and overstaffed industry. In 1995, four of the largest six banks lost money
but Merita managed a $14 million profit. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm</B> <I>Alfred Berg</I> <BR>
<BR>
Alfred Berg is the leading Nordic securities house and has an unmatched
reputation for research and service. It dominates the region's securities
market and was placed top in last November's <I>Euromoney</I> European brokers'
poll, for equity research, execution and economic research in Finland. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
The Finnish Guarantee Board gave Citibank the award for the &quot;most pro-active
bank&quot;, and Finnish bankers consider it well ahead of other foreign
banks in the country. Since our last awards, Citi has won 90% of global
custody business from Finnish corporates and has been the lead arranger
on 75% of Finnish domestic bond issues. Of the Finnish equities traded in
the US, 95% are traded by Citi. 
<H4>France </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</I> <BR>
<BR>
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale has baseline operational profits
that beat the other large French banks on all ratios. In 1995 it posted
a net income of Ffr3.82 billion ($748 million) and a return of average equity
of 7.94%. A cautious strategy and a good control of costs paid off during
the property slump, because SocGen was not hit as hard as its competitors.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts et Consignations</I>
<BR>
<BR>
CDC participated as co-lead manager in the privatization of French tobacco
company Sieta, and manufacturers Uniscor Sacilor and Pechiney, placing a
combined total of Ffr2.24 billion ($458 million) since July 1995. It was
also lead underwriter for the Ffr880 million Club Med share issue. For the
second year running, CDC came out well ahead in the French section of May's
<I>Euromoney</I> government bond traders' poll. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank<I> </I></B><I>JP Morgan</I> <BR>
<BR>
JP Morgan was voted top foreign bank in the French Eurobond market and also
top foreign bank in the French government bond market in May's <I>Euromoney</I>
bond traders' poll. The opinions of JP Morgan's peers are bolstered by the
bank's appearance at the top of the bookrunner league table, having run
the books on over 5% of the issues since June 1995. 
<H4><A NAME="europeg"></A>Germany </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Deutsche Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Deutsche Bank is implementing a cost-reduction strategy. It is Germany's
largest bank by asset base and after the unfortunate episode of absconding
property tycoon J&uuml;rgen Schneider, it bounced back with a return on
average equity of 9.1% in 1995 - by far the highest of any of the top
10 German banks. At Dm1.524 billion ($1 billion), its 1995 profits were
more than twice those of its nearest rival. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</I> <BR>
<BR>
In May's <I>Euromoney</I> bond traders' poll, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell scored
more than twice as many votes as its nearest rival for Deutschmark Eurobond
trading and nearly three times the number of votes for German government
bond trading. In last November's <I>Euromoney </I>European brokers' poll,
it was voted first for equity research, equity execution and economic research.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Morgan Stanley</I> <BR>
<BR>
Morgan Stanley was the leading non-German bookrunner in the Deutschmark
market in 1995, with issues including Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, KfW and
a World Bank issue for Dm3 billion, widely regarded as the Deutschmark deal
of the year. Morgan Stanley also trades more German equities than any other
foreign house and advised on M&amp;A transactions worth more than $16 billion
over the past year. <HR>
<H3>Greece </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Alpha Credit Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Alpha Credit Bank is the largest private commercial bank in Greece, with
175 branches and around 10% of retail deposits. Although its assets are
much smaller than those of some of the state banks that dominate the sector,
it has a better cost structure and so is able to undercut them. Its return
on average equity for the year to June 1996 fell a little but is still an
impressive 31%. Alpha is looking beyond the domestic market and is run by
a dynamic and forward-thinking management team. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>Sigma Securities</I> <BR>
<BR>
Sigma Securities is the largest broker in Greece, with the best quality
assets and earnings. Its profits have risen 120% since 1994 and turnover
has more than doubled. Sigma is well represented in neighbouring countries
and is the only Greek broker with a presence in Cyprus. It participated
in the OTE telephone company privatization and is itself expected to list
on the stock exchange in 1997. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank continues to feature prominently in all aspects of Greek banking
from consumer services to shipping finance and the fledgling drachma derivatives
market. It is a leading player in the Greek government bond and foreign
exchange markets. It also instituted the first ever asset and currency swaps
for its institutional customers. Citibank employs 870 people and has 21
branches across the country. <HR>
<H3><A NAME="europeh"></A>Hungary </H3>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>CIB Hungaria</I> <BR>
<BR>
CIB Hungaria is the onshore subsidiary of the Central European International
Bank in which the National Bank of Hungary will sell its 34% stake in 1997.
CIB posted a profit for 1995 of Ft5.1 billion ($36.6 million) with a return
on average equity of 39.3%. It is a respected and active bank which showed
its capabilities when arranging a loan facility through the international
markets for Westel 900 GSM, a private telephone company. This will be used
to finance the infrastructure for the Hungarian cellular telephone network.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>Concorde Securities</I> <BR>
<BR>
Concorde is the largest Hungarian securities house. It recently advised
on the Mol (oil and gas) privatization and helped float the big chemical
company BorsedChem. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm </B><I>Creditanstalt <BR>
<BR>
Securities</I> <BR>
<BR>
Austrian firm Creditanstalt is the only foreign-based securities house with
a solid presence in Budapest, including a full complement of traders and
analysts. This has enabled it to consolidate its position as a leading broker
on the exchange and to offer performance that is reckoned superior to foreign
competitors who operate from abroad. <HR>
<H3><A NAME="europei"></A>Ireland </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Bank of Ireland</I> <BR>
<BR>
For the second year running Bank of Ireland has produced an improved pre-tax
profit, up to I&#163;362 million ($593 million). Its return on average equity
was an impressive 24.44%, which was much better than any of its competitors.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>Davy</I> <BR>
<BR>
Davy is still the largest brokerage house in Ireland, with a customer base
that includes many of the top corporations and richest individuals. It handles
a third of the equity business by volume. Once again it topped May's <I>Euromoney</I>
bond traders' poll for Irish government bonds, a sure sign of its continuing
market dominance. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank has a 15% market share in domestic bonds and a 30% share of the
market for foreign bonds. The only foreign bank which is an official market-maker
in the punt, it is well placed in the foreign exchange market. <HR>
<H3>Italy </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Credito Italiano</I> <BR>
<BR>
Milan-based Credito Italiano was, in December 1994, the first of the state-owned
commercial banks to be privatized and has continued to perform strongly.
In 1995 it acquired Bologna-based Credito Romagnolo. Last year its profits
grew by 211% to $123 million. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>Istituto Mobiliare Italiano </I><BR>
<BR>
In 1995, Istituto Mobiliare Italiano's return on equity, at 7.4%, was the
largest of Italy's top 10 financial institutions and it made an improved
profit of $336 million. It was selected to coordinate the Italian part of
the highly successful flotation of state oil company ENI. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B><I> CS First Boston</I> <BR>
<BR>
CS First Boston was the most profitable foreign bank operating in Italy
in 1995 - in large part because of its global coordinator role in the
flotation of state oil company ENI. Worth $3.95 billion, this proved to
be the largest ADR issue in 1995. <HR>
<H3><A NAME="europel"></A>Luxembourg </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Banque G&eacute;n&eacute;rale du Luxembourg</I> <BR>
<BR>
Banque G&eacute;n&eacute;rale du Luxembourg has had the Luxembourg market
wrapped up for a long time. The largest of the principality's banks, it
is the dominant player in the Luxembourg franc bond market and has lead-arranged
22 issues since our last awards. None of its rivals can match it for volume
of business or sway in the market. 
<H4><A NAME="europen"></A>Netherlands </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>ABN Amro</I> <BR>
<BR>
ABN Amro is the largest bank in the Netherlands by equity and assets, and
made a profit in 1995 of $1.6 billion. It has an impressive return on average
equity of 13.7%, which is better than most of its competitors with an asset
base of comparable size. During 1996 the bank has lead-managed two Eurobond
issues for the European Investment Bank and has further bolstered its human
resources by luring staff from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and elsewhere. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>Mees Pierson</I> <BR>
<BR>
Mees Pierson is part of the ABN Amro group, but is independent and is entirely
responsible for its own strategy and research. In November's <I>Euromoney
</I>European broker's poll, it was voted top for equity execution, and second
(ABN Amro was first) in equity research and economic research. This was
the best aggregate result in the Dutch section of the poll. Mees Pierson
has an excellent record for bringing companies to the market, their latest
being the hi-tech design company, Axxicom. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>SBC Warburg</I> <BR>
<BR>
The Netherlands is a tough marketplace for any foreign bank, so it is impressive
that SBC Warburg is so highly regarded by Dutch banks. Since our last awards,
SBC Warburg was noteworthy for leading the successful placement of $500
million of shares in Nutricia (a babyfood company) on behalf of Unigate.
<HR>
<H3>Norway </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Union Bank of Norway</I> <BR>
<BR>
Norway has recovered from the Nordic region's property slump and banking
crisis. Few banks escaped unscathed, and in a period of reconstruction,
Union Bank is doing best. In 1995 its profits more than doubled to $439
million, the largest of the Norwegian banks. Its return on average equity,
at 41.7%, was also more than double that of its nearest rival. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm</B><I> Alfred Berg</I> <BR>
<BR>
Alfred Berg is dominant in securities across the whole region and in Norway
was global coordinator for the partly refloated Fokus Bank. Alfred Berg's
research and execution are universally considered impeccable, as was demonstrated
by its showing in last November's <I>Euromoney</I> European brokers' poll
where it was top in equity research, equity execution and economic research.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B><I> Svenska Handelsbanken</I> <BR>
<BR>
Svenska Handelsbanken had to tough out the banking crisis after a period
of expansion throughout the region which could have led to its to being
overstretched. Its extensive presence in Norway should now pay dividends.
It has 60,000 customers and more branches than any other foreign bank, and
has a reputation for keeping costs in check without reducing the quality
of its service. <HR>
<H3><A NAME="europep"></A>Poland </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Bank Handlowy w Warzawie</I> <BR>
<BR>
Bank Handlowy remains dominant in the Polish market, but partly on the back
of state support which renders it somewhat bureaucratic and slow-moving.
In 1995 it maintained its position at the top of the league tables of assets
and profits ($141 million) and posted an impressive 40% return on average
equity. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm</B><I> Polski Bank Rozwoju</I> <BR>
<BR>
In a market mostly controlled by the big custodian banks, where foreign
money is usually channelled through foreign banks, Polski Bank Rozwoju is
growing in reputation. It demonstrated its willingness to innovate by being
the first institution to offer options on the Warsaw stock exchange index.
It is also attracting business from foreign clients. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>ING</I> <BR>
<BR>
ING has a strong market presence in the Polish market and is the leading
foreign institution there in corporate banking. It has diversified into
other financial services including selling insurance through a locally-based
insurance company it owns and it hasn't been timid about involving its clients,
both domestic and foreign, in the Polish capital markets.
<H4>Portugal </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Banco Comercial Portugues</I> <BR>
<BR>
Banco Comercial Portugues has spent the year consolidating its acquisition
of Banco Portugues do Atlantico and solidifying its international presence
in such places as Macau, Mexico and Spain. Innovative, modern-minded and
aggressive, BCP has pioneered a branding policy for different market sections,
including its 19% share of the loans market. Founded as recently as 1986,
BCP is the largest private-sector bank in Portugal. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm</B> <I>Banco Portugues de <BR>
<BR>
Investimento</I> <BR>
<BR>
BPI restructured in the last half of 1995, creating a new holding company
that would give a greater focus to the separate investment and retail arms
of the group. In 1995 BPI's profits rose by 30%, to $65 million. In January
1996 it proved its ability for free thinking by making a bid for the large
state-owned development bank, Banco de Formento e Exterior (BFE). After
much deliberation, the government decided not to sell to the first bidder,
but put the bank out to tender. Prior to the BPI bid, there hadn't been
any talk of the government privatizing the bank. It is thought that BPI
will succeed at its second attempt to acquire BFE, creating at least the
fourth largest bank in Portugal. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign banks </B><I>Banco Santander de <BR>
<BR>
Negocios/Banca Bilbao Vizcaya</I> <BR>
<BR>
In investment banking Banco Santander has a strong local presence. It advised
on, structured and syndicated a $120 million loan for gas company Transgas,
the largest international financing of a Portuguese company so far in 1996.
The most active foreign retail operation is Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, which
bought up the long-established Lloyds operation in 1979 and has kept on
expanding. Recently its hundredth outlet was opened, giving BBV more than
1.5% of the retail market. 
<H4><A NAME="europer"></A>Romania </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Romanian Bank for Development </I><BR>
<BR>
Romanian Bank for Development will be the first bank to be privatized once
the long-awaited enabling legislation is passed. Privatization is an IMF
condition for granting development loans and the Romanian government has
until the end of June to enact it. The Development Bank, which has capable
management and a far-sighted strategy, has been ready for privatization
for some time. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Chase</I> <BR>
<BR>
There is a good deal of competition between investment banks to become the
predominant bank in Romania, such are the infrastructure and other investment
opportunities. This year's award goes to Chase, which in its guise as Chemical,
and before that Manufacturers Hanover, has had a presence in Romania for
22 years. (It was the first western Bank to set up there.) It is this level
of market expertize built up over time that gives Chase a head start against
competitors who entered the market only a year or two ago. As the market
becomes more sophisticated, it will be seen whether Chase can be knocked
from its perch. <HR>
<H3>Russia </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Unexim Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Unexim, which also won this category last year, is considered by a broker
active in Russia to be &quot;undoubtedly the strongest of the Russian corporate
banks&quot;. This institution's links to, and influence over, the government
are a central reason for this. Several of its senior executives used to
work for government bank IBEC. Also important is the bank's association
with nickel company Nerilsk (which has rights to 30% of the world's nickel
deposits) through its financial industrial group IFCI. In 1995 Unexim's
total assets were $3.82 billion and profits for the year were $56.2 million.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>Troika Dialog</I> <BR>
<BR>
Troika Dialog is the largest and most successful domestic Russian securities
house, and the one most foreign analysts and brokers polled had greatest
the confidence in. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm</B> <I>Brunswick</I> <BR>
<BR>
Brunswick has continued to expand at the pace the Russian capital markets
have demanded. A New York office opened in May 1996 to trade and manage
Russian securities held by Brunswick's growing number of US clients, and
this brings the number of Brunswick's offices to three. Brunswick remains
strong on sales and research and is acknowledged by market watchers to be
the leading team in the Russian capital markets. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>ING</I> <BR>
<BR>
ING was the first bank to execute a dollar-rouble swap, and the first foreign
bank to win a successful M&amp;A mandate, buying a Russian babyfood company
for a foreign investor. <HR>
<H3><A NAME="europes"></A>Slovakia </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Tatra Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Tatra Bank's association with Austrian bank Raiffeisen Zentralbank, which
has a minority stake, is a major advantage. The Austrians have given advice
and financial support to Tatra, which has continued to build on the reputation
for reliability that helped it win this category last year. Tatra is the
smallest of the Slovak banks, but is stronger in information technology
than any other. It achieved a return on average equity of over 30% for 1995
- its nearest rival achieved less than 9%. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B><I> ING</I> <BR>
<BR>
ING offer the most comprehensive service of any of the foreign banks with
representation in Slovakia, including corporate finance and capital markets.
It counts the largest and most successful of the Slovak corporations among
its customers. It was the first to introduce electronic banking and is the
only foreign bank to have expanded outside the capital, having an office
in Kosice as well as in Bratislava. <HR>
<H3>Spain </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Banco Popular Espa&ntilde;ol</I> <BR>
<BR>
Banco Popular made a profit of $474 million in 1995 from an asset and equity
base considerably smaller than most of its competitors. It won this award
last year because of its efficient use of resources, and it remains a well-run
bank and analysts' favourite. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>Santander Investment Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Spain's largest bank by assets is strong in Asia, North America and has
links with the UK through the Royal Bank of Scotland. Recently, it has concentrated
on building its Latin American operations and on July 1 completed its acquisition
of Banco Sorno, Chile's fourthlargest bank. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>JP Morgan</I> <BR>
<BR>
JP Morgan has an active and well-managed operation in Spain with over 200
employees offering a comprehensive range of services. It is a primary government
bond dealer and is general strategic adviser to Telefonica, the Spanish
telephone network. A recent deal of note was JP Morgan's bookrunning of
the $300 million offering by the conglomerate Repsol SA, the first yankee
issue by a Spanish corporation. It was the top foreign bank in a bookrunner's
league table in July 1995 and now. Its private banking facility is also
highly regarded and much used by Spain's high net worth individuals. <HR>
<H3>Sweden </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Svenska Handelsbanken</I> <BR>
<BR>
All Swedish banks went through a difficult period at the beginning of the
1990s but all had returned to profit by 1995. Svenska Handelsbanken's profits
nearly doubled to $636 million in 1995 and it was the only one of the main
banks that had been strong enough to survive without massive amounts of
public money being pumped in. The bank has continued to expand abroad -
moves this year included the opening of a representative office for the
Baltic states in Tallinn, Estonia. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>Alfred Berg</I> <BR>
<BR>
In last November's <I>Euromoney</I> European brokers' poll Alfred Berg came
top in equity research, equity execution and economic research. It remains
the foremost securities house in Sweden. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank is the leader in the Swedish forex and derivatives markets, and
was one of the first to offer an emerging market capability in Sweden. It
is also strong in American Depositary Receipts, playing an important role
in allowing Swedish corporations to tap into the US and international capital
markets. It manages over two-thirds of Swedish ADR programmes, including
those for Scania and Nordbanken. It is also one of the top banks in Sweden
for syndicated loans and gives the most comprehensive service of any of
the foreign banks. <HR>
<H3>Switzerland </H3>
<B>Best bank and securities firm </B><I>SBC Warburg</I> <BR>
<BR>
SBC Warburg saw group profits rise by 30% to Swfr 1,053 million ($880 million)
in 1995. The return on equity was 7.52% over the same period. On the downside,
operating expenses climbed 38% and administrative costs by 29%, but this
can be put down to consolidation of SBC with SG Warburg, and the full integration
of the two is now said to be complete. This award in some part goes to SBC
Warburg by default, after the fiasco of the Credit Suisse/UBS merger attempt,
in April 1996. <BR>
<BR>
That is not to say that it doesn't deserve the award. In the Swiss capital
markets arena, SBC Warburg has shown innovation. Leader in Japanese issues
in the Swiss market for 1995, and for 1996 so far, SBC Warburg also brought
a rare newcomer to the Swiss market in the shape of Henkel, a German cosmetics
company. SBC was also the co-bookrunner of choice for Deutsche Bank, for
the first ever synthetic convertible bond issued in the Swiss market. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Merrill Lynch</I> <BR>
<BR>
Of all the foreign banks with significant operations in Switzerland, none
is more significant than that of Merrill Lynch. Alone among the foreign
banks, it can compete with the big three Swiss banks. Merrill is the foreign
bank with the greatest involvement in the Swiss franc new issue market,
accounting for 11.5% of volume in 1995, as well as 13.7% of all AAA-rated
issues for the same period. Also very strong in Swiss franc-dollar swaps,
Merrill Lynch is way ahead of its foreign competitors in the Swiss market
place. 
<H4><A NAME="europet"></A>Turkey </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Turkiye Garanti Bankasi</I> <BR>
<BR>
Despite not being the largest bank by equity or assets in Turkey, and therefore
perhaps not the strongest, Garanti takes this award for another year because
of its high return on equity of 45%. The bank is trying to improve its international
credit rating through a policy of transparency and straightforwardness that
some other Turkish banks would do well to emulate. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>Finansbank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Finansbank's impressive growth figures (120% on assets) and return on equity
(48%) make Finansbank the choice for yet another year. Heavy expenditure
on the firm's equity research department has paid off, enabling it to track
investment opportunities in 100 companies in 17 sectors. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Chase</I> <BR>
<BR>
Chase has the biggest presence of the foreign banks in Turkey in foreign
exchange and government securities. It is also the largest global custodian,
with responsibility for assets of over $800 million in May 1996. Chase is
very active in pushing the build-operate-transfer (BOT) project finance
concept and has acted as financial adviser and arranger on the Birecek dam
and hydro-power project, and the dam for an improved water supply to Istanbul
and Izmit. These were the first such BOT-based financing deals closed in
Turkey. 
<H4><A NAME="europeu"></A>UK </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>HSBC</I> <BR>
<BR>
HSBC has been bookrunner on over 7.5% of bond issues in the UK since July
1995, totalling $41 billion in value. If the issues in which it played the
role of co-lead manager or joint lead manager are included, the figure mushrooms
to $145.2 billion - an involvement in 26.67% of all UK issues since
July 1995. It is the largest of the UK-based banks by assets, with an ROAE
of 15.6% for 1995 and profits of $3.82 billion. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm </B><I>BZW</I> <BR>
<BR>
Another good year for BZW, the securities arm of Barclays Bank which, since
our last awards, has played a role in a greater number of UK issues -
559 issues worth $142 billion - than any other institution, domestic
or foreign. In 1995 Barclays Bank - the third largest in the UK by
equity - made a profit of &#163;1.4 billion ($2.1 billion), making
it the second most profitable UK bank last year. BZW accounted for 14% of
this profit ($294 million). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank </I><BR>
<BR>
Largest of the foreign banks in UK, with 4,000 employees, Citi is pre-eminent
in forex, coming top in the<I> Euromoney </I>forex poll for May 1996 and
laying claim to as much as 9% of the London market. Citi opened its first
retail branch in 1995, but remains predominantly an investment bank with
a selection of products that revolve around its unsurpassed foreign exchange
and cash management services. Among its London employees, Citibank can boast
the chairman of Liffe and a member of the chancellor of the exchequer's
city advisory panel. 
<H2>Asia </H2>
<H4><A NAME="asiaa"></A>Australia </H4>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>MacQuarie</I> <BR>
<BR>
Australia's strongest locally-owned bank, MacQuarie has continued to achieve
a combination of market leadership and impressive profit performance. Its
dominant foreign exchange position also continues to be enhanced by a strong
presence in derivatives. Its traditional strength in infrastructure finance
- with A$6 billion ($4.7 billion) of transactions completed in the
past four years - has been further developed with the establishment
of an infrastructure fund management division. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>JB Were</I> <BR>
<BR>
Comfortably on top of the league tables for both research and sales capabilities,
JB Were continues to enjoy the distinction of being Australia's foremost
securities house. As the only independent full-service broker of note, it
also remains pre-eminent in private client business. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B><I> Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Now effectively out-muscling Australia's big four commercial banks, Citibank
relies on a combination of product innovation, technology and creativity
in retail service to comfortably outpace its foreign rivals. Landmark deals
in 1995 included arranging Pacificorp's A$1.325 billion revolving credit
facility, acting as issuing and paying agent for GE Capital Australia's
A$2 billion commercial paper programme and becoming global custodian for
Colonial Mutual's A$500 million securities business. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm </B><I>County NatWest</I> <BR>
<BR>
A growing reputation for specialist research together with an all-round
strong showing in sales and execution helped County NatWest to maintain
a comfortable lead on its foreign rivals in 1995. 
<H4><A NAME="asiac"></A>China </H4>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>Bank of China</I> <BR>
<BR>
In a class of its own, ahead of China's other specialized banks, Bank of
China is comfortably the most advanced and sophisticated. Backed by superior
credit and financial strength ratings, it has also continued to expand abroad
while its forays into investment banking are making an increasing contribution
to the bottom line. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>Shenying Securities</I> <BR>
<BR>
Its merger with former giant Shanghai International Securities has created
the only serious contender in China's confused securities markets. Its size,
reach, distribution and product line dwarf those of its rivals. A growing
commitment to research also makes it the only house with a true institutional
following. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Using its 94-year links with China as leverage, Citibank has become the
major bank to most multinational companies operating there as well as the
only foreign bank engaged in direct investment. It also leads the league
tables in providing advisory services to large projects and joint ventures,
and has bolstered its relations with China's specialized banks. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm </B><I>Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Securities
Asia (CLSA)</I> <BR>
<BR>
Despite the patchy nature of the Chinese securities markets, CLSA wins applause
for refusing to reduce either its excellent research commitment or profile
in Shanghai. Consistently the biggest broker of B shares, it has also pulled
off notable corporate finance coups in a year which saw few deals of note.

<H4><A NAME="asiah"></A>Hong Kong </H4>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>HSBC</I> <BR>
<BR>
The emergence of HSBC Markets as a top-tier investment bank in its short
two-year existence has added to the bank's entrenched reputation as the
biggest and best in Hong Kong. Apparently untouchable in the domestic retail
market, it has also dominated in the Hong Kong dollar debt markets. Banker
to the colony's business elite, its wholesale operations remain unmatched
in scope and penetration. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>Peregrine</I> <BR>
<BR>
Indifferent earnings have not been sufficient to eclipse Peregrine's growing
reputation as the best-connected and most agile house in Hong Kong. Three
rapidly executed placements for CITIC Pacific (HK$3 billion), Hongkong Telecom
(HK$3.63 billion) and Cheung Kong (HK$5.3 billion) in quick succession at
the start of the year confirmed its standing. Its large investment in Peregrine
Fixed Income should also begin to bear fruit as it builds the biggest regional
debt team in Asia. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
The bank enjoyed its best ever results for 1995 with double-digit net income
growth despite a generally sluggish economy. Comfortably the largest banking
corporation in the territory outside the three note-issuing banks, it continues
to provide first grade services across a full range of retail and commercial
banking products. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm </B><I>Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Securities
Asia (CLSA)</I> <BR>
<BR>
Its research continues to be innovative while exhaustive and its highly
successful Hong Kong-based Investors Forum - which attracted 680 top
institutional investors and corporate clients in May - attests to its
growing reach. Its lead management of highly successful listings for both
New World and Henderson Land's China Investments also boosted its corporate
finance profile.
<H4><A NAME="asiai"></A>India </H4>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>State Bank of India</I> <BR>
<BR>
Both the oldest and the largest commercial bank in the country, the State
Bank of India has parlayed its venerable reputation into one aggressively
seeking to consolidate its position as the leading deposit holder. Backed
by a strong BIS capital ratio of 12.75%, it has also made strong inroads
into the securities industry where its wide geographic representation promises
to reap considerable profits. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>SSKI</I> <BR>
<BR>
It overcame the defection of inspirational sales director Rajesh Kalra to
Morgan Stanley to establish itself as the only serious local house to compete
with the traditionally strong foreign brokers. It wins particular praise
for its well-informed research product. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm</B><I> Jardine Fleming</I> <BR>
<BR>
A slow year in corporate finance - where few houses shone - meant
that Jardine Fleming's well-established superiority in research and sales
kept it easily ahead of its foreign rivals. <HR>
<H3>Indonesia </H3>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>Bank Internasional Indonesia </I><BR>
<BR>
BII impressed all by becoming Indonesia's most profitable bank in 1995 with
a return on assets of 2%. It has calmed fears of excessive intergroup lending
by significantly reducing such loans in line with government regulation,
while its increasingly prudent provisioning levels have also pleased analysts
and investors. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>Bahana Pembinaan Usaha Indonesia</I>
<BR>
<BR>
The state-owned but entrepreneurially run Bahana has quickly earned the
distinction of being Indonesia's most solid and reputable securities house.
Starring roles in such high profile deals as the privatization of PT Telkom
have also enhanced its corporate finance capacity, while the interaction
of foreign and domestic staff has been smooth. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank </I><BR>
<BR>
A strong all-round showing in commercial, investment and consumer banking
earns Citi the laurels. Its 1,000 staff make it the best represented foreign
bank, while its 30% market share of the credit card business is testament
to its local penetration. It also won praise as the lead arranger and facility
agent on the $633 million project financing for the Cilacap Pertamina oil
refinery. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm </B><I>BZW</I> <BR>
<BR>
Though its timing and execution were unfortunate, BZW's role as global coordinator
of the $224 million privatization of tin mining company Tambang Timah through
an IPO listed in Jakarta and London in October was a notable success for
its increasingly high profile corporate finance operation. Its refusal to
play the first family card - paying for close relationships with members
of president Suharto's family - favoured by others is also a plus.
A solid reputation in sales and research also stands it in good stead. 
<H4><A NAME="asiaj"></A>Japan </H4>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>Sumitomo Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Unconventional - by Japanese standards - the Osaka-based Sumitomo
was the first city bank to bite the bad loans bullet and report a loss.
The bank deserves credit for its resilience in bouncing back from the latest
in a long line of scandals and setbacks by stressing profitability above
market share. Its refusal to accept <I>amakudari</I> - former ministry
of finance officials who look for lucrative private sector jobs upon retirement
- has also helped its reputation in a year when the ministry has suffered
its own share of brickbats. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>Nomura Securities</I> <BR>
<BR>
With the vicissitudes suffered by others among the traditional big four
securities houses, Nomura has consolidated its position as the unquestioned
leader in Japan. Increasingly facing a foreign rather than a domestic challenge
to its hegemony, Nomura has impressed all with its increasingly objective
research. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Boasting both the largest retail branch network among foreign banks in Japan
and the most extensive product line, Citibank alone among its peers has
succeeded in persuading the nation's notoriously selective consumers of
its value. Last year also marked the eighth in a row that Citi ranked first
among foreign banks in the Nikkei Opinion Survey of banks and securities
firms. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm </B><I>Merrill Lynch</I> <BR>
<BR>
Its &#165;9.8 billion operating income was the highest of all foreign securities
houses in Japan in the six months to September 1995 and was backed by its
receiving the most votes in the <I>Nihon Keizai Shimbun'</I>s annual survey
as the best foreign securities firm for the ninth year in a row. Merrill
also became the first non-Japanese house to be sole lead-manager for a Japanese
domestic bond - Itochu's &#165;10 billion issue in December 1995. 
<H4><A NAME="asiak"></A>Korea </H4>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>Shinhan Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
With bad news dogging Korea's banking industry throughout 1995 - mainly
occasioned by non-performing loans and questionable asset quality -
Shinhan did very well to be the country's most profitable bank while maintaining
a solid balance sheet and minimizing its exposure to bad debts. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>Ssangyong Securities </I><BR>
<BR>
Led by the flamboyant and dynamic Milton Kim, Ssangyong weathered well the
storms that afflicted all in Korea's stock markets in 1995. The appointment
of highly-rated Steven Marvin from Jardine Fleming as head of research should
bolster an already improving research division. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
The largest foreign bank in Korea and the only one with a retail branch
network, Citibank also operates a successful wholly-owned securities company
and a joint venture leasing entity. Its wide product range and 29-year history
in the market have augmented its position as market leader. It also achieved
the notable first in 1995 of arranging the first MTN programme in Korea
with a $500 million global MTN structure for Chohung Bank. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm</B><I> Jardine Fleming</I> <BR>
<BR>
The mercurial leadership of Philip Smiley continues to keep Jardine Fleming
at the head of the pack in Korea. It is the top-ranked foreign house with
post-tax profits of Won4 billion ($5 million) last year and it also managed
to increase commission income by 30% in a year when turnover was down by
35%. It guarantees strong coverage and distribution through its eight dedicated
Korean market specialists in Hong Kong, New York and London. 
<H4><A NAME="asiam"></A>Malaysia </H4>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>Malayan Banking</I> <BR>
<BR>
At more than twice the size of its nearest competitor, Malayan Banking is
the giant of the industry in Malaysia. It deserves extra praise, as a result,
for its record in 1995 of both increasing profitability - with a healthy
return on equity of 15.7% - and reducing overheads. An enterprising
but prudent move into foreign markets has also seen overseas earnings increase
from scratch to more than 15% of total earnings in less than two years.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>Rashid Hussain</I> <BR>
<BR>
Probably the best-connected house in Malaysia, Rashid Hussain continues
to win friends and diversify its product base. Growing corporate finance
revenues are backed by a strong research product and an innovative approach
to Islamic financial services to make it very much the local house to beat.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
The bank's $102 million in profits before tax with a 3.9% return on assets
in 1995 amply demonstrate its market leadership. It also overtook American
Express as the leading credit card issuer with over 25% of the market in
1995 after entering the business from scratch in 1990. The bank also earned
plaudits with a $125 million bond issue for AAF-McQuay in February 1996,
marking the prestigious Hong Leong group's debut in the US capital markets.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm </B><I>Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Securities
Asia (CLSA)</I> <BR>
<BR>
A concerted effort to boost its research product has propelled CLSA to the
top of the league tables in Malaysia while complementing its status as one
of the most profitable branches in Asia. Enjoying a reputation as the best
connected foreign house in Kuala Lumpur, its move into futures and options
should garner even greater rewards. 
<H4><A NAME="asian"></A>New Zealand </H4>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>Bank of New Zealand</I> <BR>
<BR>
Comfortably the largest bank in the country, Bank of New Zealand's $14.4
billion asset base is over twice as a big as that of its nearest rival.
Fast-paced loan growth of close to 25% during 1995 reflected an aggressive
strategy during a boom year for economic growth, while its 33.1% return
on equity was one of the highest in the Asia-Pacific region. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>Buttle Wilson</I> <BR>
<BR>
A strong showing in both sales and trading, and research has enabled Buttle
Wilson to leap-frog over traditional favourites Doyle Paterson Brown and
Hendry Hay McIntosh to win this year. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>CS First Boston </I><BR>
<BR>
By augmenting its established strengths as both stockbroker and investment
bank, CS First Boston continues to hold sway at the top of the league tables
for both foreign and domestic houses. 
<H4><A NAME="asiap"></A>Pakistan </H4>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>Faysal Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Though relatively small, with total assets as of December 1995 of $400 million,
Faysal enjoys the benefits of strong and stable backing in a country where
banking can be extremely volatile. Its loan growth of 84% in 1995 was stellar
and both its return on assets (2.3%) and return on equity (25%) were reasons
for celebrations. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>KASB</I> <BR>
<BR>
Still the most prominent among of the local houses, KASB alone is capable
of rivalling the growing number of foreigners seeking purchase in this emerging
market. A commendable research effort offers valuable local insight while
its sales and trading team is one of the best in the country. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm</B><I>WI Carr</I> <BR>
<BR>
One of the few WI Carr operations to escape the ravages of internal turmoil
in the Indosuez-owned house's Asian business, the Pakistan branch provided
top quality research backed by strong sales and trading capabilities. Cr&eacute;dit
Lyonnais is hot on its tail, and 1996 should prove to be a highly competitive
year. <HR>
<H3>Philippines </H3>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>PCIBank</I> <BR>
<BR>
PCIBank has done well to ward off growing competition in the face of the
10 new foreign banks licensed last year. It deserves credit for diversifying
its product base while remaining the most profitable bank in the country.
A Ps5 billion ($190 million) increase in its capital base in 1995 has given
it an industry-leading BIS capital ratio of 23% which should allow it to
become the country's first full-service commercial bank. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>Exchange Capital</I> <BR>
<BR>
Strong leadership from Luis Virata and Danilo Feliciano make Exchange Capital
the most influential and innovative house in the Philippines. It racked
up a number of corporate finance firsts during 1995 including the first
zero coupon exchangeable note for an Asian company with its $142 million
deal for Ayala Corporation, and the first Euroconvertible bond issue for
a Philippine bank with Metrobank's $100 million transaction. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>ING</I> <BR>
<BR>
Known locally as 'Bing Bank' in recognition of branch manager Renato de
Guzman's nickname and prominence, ING achieved a record profit of $16.2
million during 1995. Trading volume, largely in the bank's forte of Brady
bonds, rose to $3.4 billion during the year while increased revenue from
expansion into project finance and capital markets signalled a clear success
for its diversification strategy. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm</B><I> Asia Equity</I> <BR>
<BR>
Led by top-ranked research head Matthew Sutherland, Asia Equity blazed a
trail up the league tables in 1995. With sales and trading improving in
line with the consistency and professionalism of its research product, it
has become the rising star of foreign houses in the Philippines. 
<H4><A NAME="asias"></A>Singapore </H4>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>United Overseas Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
UOB now places ahead of all comers in profitability, with industry-leading
returns on assets and equity of 1.59% and 17% respectively. Its domestic
edge continues to be its prominence in the consumer loan market while it
has also expanded overseas. UOB now makes 30% of its profits from foreign
business. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>GK Goh</I> <BR>
<BR>
At last dislodging rival Kim Eng from pole position in the domestic market,
GK Goh is reaping the rewards of an improved research division. In following
the many Malaysian stocks which are returning to their home base in Kuala
Lumpur, GK Goh has also made great inroads into the Malaysian market where
its ranking has increased from 15th to 7th in the past year. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
The bank's 94-year history in Singapore has enabled it to build the best
full-service franchise and significant market share across its consumer
banking, corporate finance and fund management operations. Its versatility
was apparent in the S$2.7 billion ($1.9 billion) of corporate finance transactions
completed in 1995 which included the S$700 million refinancing of Republic
Plaza and the lead advisory position in Orchard Parade Holdings' successful
takeover of Yeo Hiap Seng. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm </B><I>Crosby</I> <BR>
<BR>
Though still trailing ING in certain league tables, Crosby earns distinction
as the most improved house in Singapore. Its specialist research product
is highly valued by investors and its impartiality in an often difficult
operating environment also wins praise. 
<H4><A NAME="asiat"></A>Taiwan </H4>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>United World Chinese Commercial Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Institutional investors are keenly awaiting the proposed listing of UWC
to gain access to one of Taiwan's most profitable banks. Despite a relatively
short 21-year history, the bank has built up both a substantial branch network
and a commanding position in the fast-growing consumer banking market. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>Grand Cathay</I> <BR>
<BR>
Well connected and increasingly entrepreneurial, Grand Cathay has broken
away from the pack of Taiwanese brokerage companies. Its comprehensive and
insightful work in the local debt markets also distinguishes it from its
more equity-reliant competitors. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
From a standing start in 1994, Citibank has become the largest foreign bank
in Taiwan in terms of assets, profits, business scope, number of branches
and number of employees. With a staff of 2,000, a retail customer base of
over 100,000 and 1,500 corporate clients, its numbers have quickly become
compelling. It also snared the lion's share of high-profile syndicated loan
mandates with a $300 million facility for Winbond Electronics and a $400
million loan for TI-Acer signed in March and February respectively. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm </B><I>ING</I> <BR>
<BR>
Of all the Asian countries where ING's first-rate research is highly valued,
it is in Taiwan where it is the most entrenched and best exploited. Its
uncontested reign at the top of all relevant league tables continues unabated
and its much respected management will be hard pushed to resist the lure
of higher-paid employment elsewhere. 
<H4>Thailand </H4>
<B>Best domestic bank</B><I> Bangkok Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
From its Bt4 million ($159,000) registered capital base upon inception in
1944, the bank has grown into the largest bank in south-east Asia with a
total asset base of Bt928 billion - about 25% of Thailand's GDP -
and equity of Bt80.2 billion as of March 1995. It accounts for about 24.2%
and 22.5% respectively of the Thai banking sector's total loans and deposits.
It has coped well with increasing competition and new managerial blood has
increased its share of capital market business. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best domestic securities firm </B><I>Phatra Thanakit</I> <BR>
<BR>
Well positioned to take advantage of increased deregulation, Phatra Thanakit
offers a wide range of capital market products. Particularly strong in the
rapidly growing domestic debt markets, its prominence in the secondary market
should translate to its bottom line. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
In less than 10 years of activity in Thailand, Citi has become one of the
largest and most diversified banks in the country. Dwarfing the growth rates
of its foreign bank competitors, it now ranks first in terms of deposits
and commands strong market share in the international bank card (29%), auto-financing
(5%) and residential home loan (3%) markets. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm </B><I>WI Carr</I> <BR>
<BR>
Though hotly pursued by ING, WI Carr continues to occupy top position in
most rankings of research and sales in Thailand. Good corporate connections
in the local market combined with a run of accurate stock-picking enhance
its profile with corporate treasurers and investors alike. <HR>
<H3><A NAME="asiav"></A>Vietnam </H3>
<B>Best domestic bank </B><I>Saigon Bank for Industry and Trade</I> <BR>
<BR>
Public confidence in Vietnam's banks has taken many batterings, with systemic
collapses in 1975 and the late 1980s all too fresh in most depositors' minds.
Saigon Bank has done much to rebuild and educate, as indicated by its burgeoning
asset and deposit bases. Much credit is due to its visionary deputy director
general Huynh Buu Son. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>ING </I><BR>
<BR>
The gentle but authoritative Jurg Vontobel's stewardship of ING in Ho Chi
Minh City has shaped a bank well positioned to take advantage of scheduled
deregulation and market liberalization. One of the few foreign banks in
Vietnam to have successfully completed deals, it also enjoys strong relationships
at government level which should help in the potentially lucrative corporate
restructuring market. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm </B><I>Peregrine</I> <BR>
<BR>
Alhough it is difficult to act as a securities house in the absence of a
stock exchange, Peregrine's opportunist approach has earned it many fans
in Vietnam. Much is due to the entrepreneurial Nguyen Trung Truc, its managing
director, whose extensive web of local contacts has enabled him to avoid
government interference. His wide-ranging automobiles-to-real-estate ventures
should pay off if allowed to continue, while Peregrine is excellently placed
to take advantage of the proposed establishment of a stock market. 
<H2>North America </H2>
<H4><A NAME="namericac"></A>Canada </H4>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>Royal Bank of Canada</I> <BR>
<BR>
Royal Bank of Canada is the country's largest bank and has the strongest
retail franchise. Analysts say it has the critical mass and technological
capability needed to maintain a competitive edge while driving down costs.
It has the potential to become the industry's lowest-cost producer and price
leader. Considered by some in the market to be Canada's prime bank credit,
it is the top-ranked dealer in foreign exchange and currency swaps. Like
Canada's other big banks, it is currently focusing on international growth
opportunities, especially in the US. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm</B> <I>CIBC Wood Gundy</I> <BR>
<BR>
CIBC Wood Gundy is the investment and corporate banking arm of CIBC, Canada's
second-largest bank, which has led the way in marrying commercial and investment
banking operations as the financial sector has consolidated in recent years.
It is the leader in domestic fixed-income research and in arranging Euro-Canadian
dollar bond offerings. In addition to vigorous growth in underwriting and
brokerage, recent expansion has targeted loan securitization, derivatives
and proprietary trading, primarily in North America. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank has long maintained an important presence in Canada, where US multinationals
play a large role in the economy, but has been handicapped by discriminatory
restrictions on foreign banks. These constraints are currently under review
by the Canadian government. Meanwhile, in addition to serving large US and
Canadian corporate clients, Citibank offices in Toronto, Scarborough, Montreal,
Calgary, Richmond and Vancouver offer corporate real estate, credit card,
consumer and private banking services. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign securities firm</B> <I>Goldman Sachs</I> <BR>
<BR>
Goldman Sachs is one of the leading managers of yankee bond offerings by
Canadian borrowers and last year's calendar included two notable high-yield
issues in the US for Canadian clients, one of them the first by a real-estate
company. In addition, Goldman acted as joint global coordinator and US and
international lead manager for the sale of shares in Canadian National Railway
Company, Canada's largest-ever privatization. 
<H4><A NAME="namericau"></A>United States </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank is the largest US bank in terms of revenues and earnings, but not
now in assets or equity. Its robust recovery of recent years continues,
with mounting profitability, improving asset quality and stronger capital
ratios. Based in the world's most competitive financial services market,
but operating worldwide, Citibank has a unique brand name and franchise.
This, combined with enviable technological and marketing skills, often enables
it to set standards for the industry as a whole. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm</B> <I>Merrill Lynch</I> <BR>
<BR>
Merrill Lynch is by far the largest and most diversified US securities firm,
providing an unrivalled array of financial products and services to a huge
customer base of individuals and institutions. Consistently the leading
underwriter of US debt and equity, with a growing market share, it is on
track to achieve its goal of over $1 trillion of private-client accounts
by 2000. Thanks in part to the long-running US bull market in stocks, and
vibrant investment banking activities, Merrill's average pre-tax return
on shareholders equity has exceeded 35% over the last five years. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Union Bank of Switzerland</I> <BR>
<BR>
Currently celebrating its 50th year in New York, Union Bank of Switzerland
boasts a rapidly expanding US client base, in part reflecting the fact that
it is one of the few international banks that still has a triple-A credit
rating from both major rating agencies, a significant competitive advantage
in lending and credit enhancement. Following an aggressive recruiting drive,
UBS is also active on a variety of other fronts, including arranging and
underwriting debt and equity financings, merger-related advisory work, fixed-income
and asset-backed debt trading, and private banking and asset management.

<H2>Latin America </H2>
<H4><A NAME="lamericaa"></A>Argentina </H4>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>Banco Frances del Rio de la Plata</I> <BR>
<BR>
One of the oldest private banks in Latin America, Banco Frances has traditionally
served the largest companies in Buenos Aires but in recent years has extended
its franchise to smaller businesses and individuals. Despite difficult economic
conditions, the bank's conservative management continues to achieve high
levels of efficiency and profitability while maintaining superior asset
quality and a solid capital base. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank is the second-largest private-sector bank in terms of revenues
and the third-largest in deposits, far ahead of any other foreign bank.
It is also one of Argentina's most efficient and profitable, offering services
from upmarket consumer banking to structured cross-border financings incorporating
swaps and hedges. Its strength is based in part on having been in Argentina
over 80 years. 
<H4><A NAME="lamericab"></A>Bolivia </H4>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>Banco Industrial</I> <BR>
<BR>
A former development bank which still counts among its minority shareholders
the International Finance Corporation, the Corporacion Andina de Fomento
and German financing agency Kreditanstalt f&uuml;r Wiederaufbau, Banco Industrial
is known for its prudent management and strong balance sheet, together with
consistent high credit quality and profitability. The bank benefits from
valuable corporate relationships and its superior ability to tap lines of
credit from foreign correspondent banks. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank is Bolivia's leading foreign bank, with a continuous presence for
over 30 years and a focus on corporate and commercial lending. Recent business
growth has not matched that of other Citibank operations in the region,
partly because the Bolivian economy has lagged behind. The bank remains
well regarded in the local marketplace, however, and there are plans to
boost consumer banking.
<H3>Brazil </H3>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>Banco Bradesco</I> <BR>
<BR>
Banco Bradesco is the largest private-sector bank in Latin America and a
dominant force in Brazilian retail banking, largely because of its vast
branch network. It is also the country's leading underwriter. Renowned for
its highly conservative collegial management and strong capital base, reinforced
by hidden reserves in the form of industrial holdings, the bank has <BR>
<BR>
continued to generate strong earnings despite difficult recent economic
conditions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best securities firm</B> <I>Banco de Investimentos Garantia</I> <BR>
<BR>
Garantia is the largest independent brokerage house in Brazil, with the
strongest capabilities in trading, underwriting and distributing local debt
and equity. The well-managed, highly profitable partnership also has an
impressive track record investing for its own account. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>ING </I><BR>
<BR>
After only 13 years in Brazil, ING has managed to develop a leading wholesale
banking, trading and brokerage operation, with about 220 employees in Sao
Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Its activities cover a broad spectrum, from trade
finance and foreign exchange to trading and underwriting international debt
and equity issues and advisory work related to project finance and privatization.
Recent highlights include several export prepayment and securitization transactions.

<H4><A NAME="lamericac"></A>Chile </H4>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>Banco O'Higgins</I> <BR>
<BR>
In recent years, Banco O'Higgins has expanded rapidly beyond its traditional
focus on large companies and trade finance to include middle-market corporate
clients and wealthier individuals. Known for its strong and conservative
management, the bank now plans to merge with Banco de Santiago, which would
create the country's leading consumer and corporate bank. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Banco Santander</I> <BR>
<BR>
Santander is by far the largest and most profitable foreign bank, as a result
of a long campaign to build its Chilean operation into a market leader,
serving both retail and corporate clients. This quest is likely to be significantly
advanced later this year when the Spanish bank is expected to acquire control
of Banco Osorno, creating the country's largest or second-largest bank.
<HR>
<H3>Colombia </H3>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>Banco Industrial Colombiano</I> <BR>
<BR>
BIC is known for its sound management, strong capital base, high asset quality
and outstanding profitability. It has one of the highest efficiency ratios
in Latin America. The bank, which caters to blue-chip companies, middle-market
businesses and affluent individuals, has also lead the way in modernization
and improving service quality. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Chase Manhattan</I> <BR>
<BR>
Chase Manhattan has carved out a valuable niche by providing advice, arranging
financing and sometimes even contributing equity participation to a growing
number of infrastructure projects in power generation, telecommunications
and oil and gas recovery. In the past year, it has managed several other
notable financings, including a $225 million five-year syndicated loan for
Colombia.
<H4><A NAME="lamericae"></A>Ecuador </H4>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>Banco Popular</I> <BR>
<BR>
Banco Popular is rated the best-managed bank in Ecuador by some analysts,
partly on the strength of the reputation of its high-profile chief executive,
Nicolas Landes. A leading player in corporate, treasury and asset management
activities, the bank has recently concentrated on boosting the efficiency
and productivity of its domestic operations. Recognizing that its home market
is small, it is also in the process of building a regional network by acquiring
institutions in neighbouring Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
In the last few years, Citibank has transformed its Quito presence from
near dormancy to an active and profitable franchise. Its image was hurt
by the fact that Citibank led the recent debt-restructuring negotiations
between Ecuador and its foreign bank creditors, but it retains excellent
relationships (the current finance minister is a former Citibanker) and
has been able to grow partly by providing services to multinationals and
Latin American companies that have recent arrived in Ecuador and are its
customers elsewhere. 
<H4><A NAME="lamericam"></A>Mexico </H4>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>Banco Inbursa</I> <BR>
<BR>
At a time when most Mexican banks are struggling to keep their heads above
water, Banco Inbursa stands out for its remarkable recent performance. Founded
three years ago by Carlos Slim, often described as Mexico's richest man,
Inbursa is one of the country's smallest banks, with four branches and less
than 200 employees. Lending mainly to industrial companies, it is part of
a larger financial group which includes an insurance company and a brokerage
house. Last year, when Mexico underwent a severe recession, Inbursa was
by far the leading bank in terms of profitability, efficiency and capital
adequacy, with extremely low leverage and minimal reported exposure to risky
and non-performing loans. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Long the only foreign bank licensed to operate in Mexico, Citibank remains
a powerful contender, even though others have now been let in. Special treatment
in the past allowed it to develop a consumer franchise with affluent clients,
forge close ties with some of Mexico's leading companies and play an important
role as an arranger of cross-border financings for Mexican borrowers. It
is still the only foreign bank with a branch in Monterrey, the northern
town home to many major companies.
<H4><A NAME="lamericap"></A>Peru </H4>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>Banco de Credito</I> <BR>
<BR>
Banco de Credito is the country's largest bank, with the most extensive
branch network and the leading market share in loans and deposits. Part
of the Credicorp financial group controlled by the Romero family, it has
maintained a high level of asset quality and is credited with the most imaginative
approach to marketing, targeting the lucrative middle market and consumer
market most effectively. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank has operated a branch in Peru for over 70 years and was the only
foreign bank which chose not to leave in the economic and political turmoil
of the 1980s. Its patience is now being rewarded in the form of strong business
growth, especially in commercial and investment banking.
<H4><A NAME="lamericav"></A>Venezuela </H4>
<B>Best bank</B> <I>Banco Provincial</I> <BR>
<BR>
Banco Provincial has successfully weathered the recent economic and financial
crisis in Venezuela and probably benefited from a flight to quality during
the upheaval. The country's largest bank, with around 25% of total loans,
it enjoys the strong backing of the controlling Mendoza group (with plentiful
cashflow from brewing interests), sound management and adequate capital.
Highly regarded in its home market, the bank counts among its clients the
local affiliates of several European multinationals. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank</B> <I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank was for many years the only foreign bank allowed to operate a fully-fledged
branch in Caracas, where it has been for decades. The small, conservatively
run franchise was mainly focused on wealthier individuals and the local
offices of US multinationals. More recently, Citibank has been a major beneficiary
of Venezuela's economic turmoil. Perceived as a safe haven, it has been
able to boost market share in consumer and corporate banking. 
<H2>Africa </H2>
<H4><BR>
<A NAME="africag"></A>Ghana </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Merchant Bank of Ghana</I> <BR>
<BR>
A small bank that is 70% owned by the state, Merchant leads the way in providing
local corporates with an efficient service. 
<H4><A NAME="africak"></A>Kenya </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Kenya Commercial Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Kenya Commercial Bank is the largest of Kenya's domestic banks. In 1995
its return on equity was nearly 40% and its profits $43 million. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank far outshines any of the domestic banks, as was demonstrated by
its role as domestic adviser to the government in the privatization of Kenya
Airways. This was the largest-ever domestic share issue, and the first time
a Kenyan company was successfully sold to international investors -
14% was bought by emerging market funds in the West. >
<H4><A NAME="africam"></A>Morocco </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Banque Marocaine du Commerce Ext&eacute;rieur</I> <BR>
<BR>
BCME's profits rose by 25% in 1995 to $36 million. Return on average equity
was a healthy 11.3%. But the award goes to BCME mainly because of its recent
innovative privatization programme. The bank also launched a global depositary
receipt scheme this year, the first not only in Morocco, but in the whole
of North Africa. 
<H4><A NAME="african"></A>Nigeria </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Nigeria International Bank (NIB)</I> <BR>
<BR>
NIB is run under contract by Citibank. It remains the undisputed leader
in the areas of technology, service and profitability. It was the first
bank to introduce electronic banking and cross-border trade financing. In
a country where many of the banking regulations are rather liberally interpreted,
NIB has a reputation among market watchers as compliant and professional.
NIB's net income in 1995 was N1,098 million ($13.7 milllion). Return on
average equity was 125%. 
<H4><BR>
<A NAME="africas"></A>South Africa </H4>
<B>Best bank/securities firm </B><I>Standard Bank/Standard Corporate Merchant
Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Standard Bank Investment Corporation, the parent of these two institutions,
posted consolidated 1995 profits of R1.15 billion ($263.6 million), and
a return on equity of 19.2%. It is the largest bank in South Africa in terms
of market capitalization. Profits in 1995 grew by a greater proportion than
those of any of the other four main South African banks and Standard is
consolidating its position in southern Africa. Having recently bought a
40% stake in Banco Standard Totta de Mocambique, Standard is fully represented
in the region except in Angola, which is under consideration. In 1995 Standard
Corporate Merchant Bank was involved in structuring and implementing the
two largest structured forward and option-based gold producer hedging strategies
to date, involving an aggregate 10.2 million ounces.
<H4><A NAME="africat"></A>Tunisia </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Tunisienne de Banque</I> <BR>
<BR>
Of the larger Tunisian banks, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Tunisienne de Banque
has posted the best return on average equity for 1995 - 14.4%. The
bank is still state-owned, but boasted profits of $15 million, the highest
for any Tunisian bank. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank is unrivalled among foreign banks in Tunisia. Strong in the foreign
exchange market and dominant in trade finance, it has shown commitment to
the country, and the region, by augmenting its local staff.
<H2>Middle East </H2>
<H4><BR>
<A NAME="meastb"></A>Bahrain </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Arab Banking Corporation</I> <BR>
<BR>
Banks in Bahrain have had a difficult year but Arab Banking Corporation,
an offshore banking unit but the largest of the institutions working in
Bahrain, has weathered the storm. The bank grew in terms of equity ($1.54
billion), assets ($21.27 billion), and profits ($116 million) in 1995. By
comparison, four of the other top six banks lost ground in terms of profit
and in some cases assets. ABC's return on aveage equity was 7.8%. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank is the dominant player in the foreign exchange markets, and the
acknowledged leader in derivatives, introducing risk management structured
finance products into the region. <HR>
<H3><A NAME="measte"></A>Egypt </H3>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Commercial International Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Commercial International Bank has long been regarded by analysts as Egypt's
leading private bank. However until July 1996 a 42.6% stake was held by
state-owned National Bank of Egypt. But 20% of CIB's stock is to be sold
by the National Bank to international investors this month. This global
depositary receipt issue will be the first international share offering
by an Egyptian company. CIB had another successful year in 1995, with profits
of $64 million and a return on average equity of over 25%. CIB is rated
highest of the Egyptian banks by international credit rating agencies, and
is Egypt's most profitable bank. It has the second-largest market cap of
companies listed on the Cairo stock exchange. 
<H4><A NAME="measti"></A>Israel </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Bank Hapoalim</I> <BR>
<BR>
Bank Hapoalim's profits rose by 13.25% last year to $215 million. It has
retained its position as the country's leading bank by assets which were
$43.52 billion in 1995. It also offers the highest rate of return on average
equity of any of the larger Israeli banks, at 13.25%. There is no other
large bank that challenges Hapoalim's supremacy on any measure. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Lehman Brothers</I> <BR>
<BR>
Lehman Brothers opened an office in Tel Aviv as recently as 1994 and has
shown impressive growth. In 1995 it did business worth $2 billion, more
than than all the other foreign banks put together. 
<H4><A NAME="meastk"></A>Kuwait </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>National Bank of Kuwait</I> <BR>
<BR>
National Bank of Kuwait is the only bank in Kuwait internationally recognized
as capable of holding its own in the top flight. It has always been superior
to other domestic institutions by equity, asset and profit value, and 1995
also enjoyed a return on average equity of nearly 20%. 
<H4><A NAME="meastl"></A>Lebanon </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Bank Audi</I> <BR>
<BR>
Bank Audi is not the highest rated of the Lebanese banks and wins this award
for its innovation. In October Audi issued a global depositary receipt which
raised $34 million. This was the first equity issue by any Lebanese institution,
and the first use of such an instrument in the entire Middle East. Banque
Audi made profits of $13 million in 1995. 
<H4><A NAME="measts"></A>Saudi Arabia </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Saudi American Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Saudi American Bank continues to perform well despite the boom days being
over. Its return on average equity was Saudi Arabia's most impressive at
27.8%. Profits of $286 million were also the highest in the kingdom and
in the Gulf Cooperation Council. One black cloud is the bank's possible
over-exposure to consumer debt (credit cards). Saudi American Bank pioneered
this market, but it is one that has recently required a high degree of provisioning.

<H4><A NAME="meastu"></A>United Arab Emirates </H4>
<B>Best bank </B><I>Mashreq Bank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Mashreq Bank is by no means the largest of the Emirate banks but it is the
only one that is independent of government. This, as so often, has led to
a tighter-run operation, and in the key category of return on equity, Mashreq
- at 23.8% - leaves the field trailing. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Best foreign bank </B><I>Citibank</I> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank has had a presence in the UAE since 1964 and is strong in both
corporate and retail banking. Citibank led the global financing of the first
Boeing 777 for Emirates. On the retail side, it is the only bank in the
UAE to offer an automated payment system, Paylink. <BR>

<H3>EDITORIAL</H3> 
<H2>Manipulative French... </H2>
In his New Year's Day address this year, president Jacques Chirac talked
about the &quot;grandeur de l'&eacute;tat fran&ccedil;ais&quot;. It's a
concept the French worry about a lot: they are determined to hang onto their
position in the world. <BR>
<BR>
That determination shows itself most clearly in the success the French have
had in winning influence in international financial organizations. Three
of the IMF's last four managing directors have been French. Jean-Claude
Paye runs the OECD. And, at the EBRD, the disastrous Jacques Attali (who
left in disgrace after his lavish spending was revealed), was replaced by
another Frenchman, Jacques de Larosi&egrave;re. De Larosi&egrave;re moved
from being governor of the Banque de France, which he'd joined after a spell
as managing director of the IMF. <BR>
<BR>
Not a bad tally. France is, after all, only the world's fourth largest economy.
The Americans have placed considerably fewer of their nationals in international
institutions. And the Germans and Japanese are almost entirely absent. The
only Japanese to head a major world body is Hiroshi Nakajima, president
of the World Health Organization. And the Germans? The only senior German
we can recall in such a job was Ernst-G&uuml;nther Br&ouml;der, president
of the EIB from 1984 to 1993. <BR>
<BR>
With the sort of power the French have won, comes great responsibility.
The French heads of world bodies must not only run their institutions efficiently
and fairly, they must also be clearly seen to be doing so. Unfortunately,
that is not always the case. <BR>
<BR>
An article in this issue details some of the apparent abuses at the EBRD,
which is increasingly becoming a French fiefdom. We do not doubt that its
president, de Larosi&egrave;re, is an honest man. But he has surrounded
himself with too many senior French advisers, and allowed the bank to transact
deals which at least appear to involve blatant conflicts of interest. <BR>
<BR>
The general reputation of French officials working for international institutions
is not good. Officials at the European Commission, for example, complain
that the French commissioners and staff too frequently take their orders
from Paris. By contrast, German and British commissioners often publicly
row with their national governments. <BR>
<BR>
The nature of French public servants is at the root of the problem. The
French establishment is much smaller and more homogeneous than that in other
countries. Heads of big companies and banks, cabinet ministers and civil
servants mostly went to school together - usually to the Ecole Nationale
d'Administration. The problem is exacerbated by the <I>dirigiste</I> nature
of the French government. French fears of being swamped by Anglo-Saxon culture
and paranoia about German power don't help. <BR>
<BR>
This system has the merit of producing high-quality, cosmopolitan civil
servants, with excellent intellectual abilities. But, unless the French
realize that being an international civil servant requires dropping national
allegiances as far as is possible, the country's reputation will suffer.
The <I>grandeur</I> of the French state could be as damaged by having too
much power and misusing it, as by losing power. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>...and sensible Germans </H3>
Rarely will such a momentous decision have been made by one man. <BR>
<BR>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany will, over the next 12 months, decide
almost single-handedly whether to go ahead with European economic and monetary
union (Emu) in 1999 or postpone it. <I>Euromoney</I>'s editors discovered
on a recent trip to Germany that the consensus in that country - at least
among the Wnance community - is that Kohl will choose to postpone it. <BR>
<BR>
Kohl agreed to Emu in 1990, the theory in Germany goes, as a <I>quid pro
quo</I> for French president Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand's approval of German
reuniWcation. The French were nervous that a united Germany would represent
too strong a concentration of power; tying them into a monetary union with
the French franc is meant to control that power. <BR>
<BR>
Kohl is a man who does not like to shift his position. He also wants to
go down in the history books as the champion of both German and European
union. But he is increasingly unable to ignore public opinion in Germany.
Most observers believe that, if a referendum were held (which it won't be
because Germany's constitution doesn't allow it), Emu would win only about
30% of the votes. <BR>
<BR>
The question now, as economist David Roche argues in his column in this
issue, is not <I>whether</I> Emu will be postponed, but <I>how</I>. <BR>
<BR>
For Kohl to switch his position unilaterally would involve a big loss of
faith for all concerned. More likely is that Kohl, Chirac and Italian prime
minister Lamberto Dini will coordinate an announcement. For various reasons
all would prefer one. The next hurdle: deciding on the length and terms
of the delay.<p>

<H3> HUNGARY</H3>


<H2> <B>Taking shareholder value on board</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>The concept of
shareholder value is transforming the way Hungarian companies communicate with
investors &#173; at least it is for the 50 or so companies traded on the Budapest
Stock Exchange. By Henry Copeland</B> </H4> 

<P> Spencer Jakab picks up a copy of
the 1993 annual report for Zalakeramia, a Hungarian building tile manufacturer.
He thumbs through its drab pages and winces.

<P> Jakab, an equity analyst at CS First Boston Budapest, raises his eye-brows
when he passes a page which features the pictures of the company's board of
directors. Filled with mug shots of alternately glum or grinning men and women,
this could be the faculty page from a junior high school yearbook. Further back
in the report is an organizational chart generated by a dot matrix printer.

<P> Jakab turns to the company's slick 1995 report. Gone are the board photos and
the dishevelled organization chart. "Now, it's one of the best looking annual
reports in Hungary. It's very nice looking. A huge difference," Jakab comments.
Of even greater interest, the report contains the news that turnover doubled in
1995 and profits were up 85% over the prior year.

<P> Annual reports for many companies traded on the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE)
have come a long way in just a few years. Their new sophistication reflects a
more fundamental change &#173; management's new-found respect for the
shareholder, say analysts and investors. As investors in other parts of eastern
Europe and the CIS struggle for control of &#173; or even information about
&#173; the companies they own, some international fund managers who have bought
Hungarian equities have the luxury of worrying about what their companies' next
quarterly IAS (international accounting standard) earnings will look like.

<P> Many of the nearly 50 companies traded on the Budapest Stock Exchange have
set up a shareholder relations department. Stock option packages for management
are increasingly common, motivating managers to think in the shareholder's
interest. And CEOs who once thought talking to investors was a distraction, now
know it's part of the job. Of course, corporate governance in Hungary is still
far from perfect, particularly outside the rarefied circle of companies traded at
the Budapest Stock Exchange. The government's control over its own companies is
shaky. And a corporate code that was the pace-setter for the region a decade ago
is growing creaky and antiquated (see box below).

<P> Still, all in all, Hungary's publicly-traded companies are among the best
behaved in the region. Gabor Sitanyi, an analyst at ING Barings, says: "As far as
the whole region is concerned, they are geniuses." He says: "If you look at the
15 to 20 most important companies on the Budapest Stock Exchange, 90% have IAS
audited cashflow, profit and loss, the full accounting balance sheet &#173;
normally all in English &#173; and some are even preparing quarterly [results]
such as Pannonplast." These companies, he concludes, "are in line with western
European standards".

<P> CS First Boston's Jakab goes one step further, saying that "to some extent
things are a little better than western Europe. The companies here would all be
small cap companies in major western countries. The access you can get as a
shareholder is much better. I can call the CEO of the biggest drug company in
Hungary and ask him a question. But if you are an analyst covering IBM, your
chances of doing more than shaking [chairman] Lou Gerstner's hand are pretty
small."

<P> <B>Years of resistance</B>

<P> The shift in management attitude has been dramatic. Sitanyi remembers that in
the early 1990s, as the government was pushing companies into publicly-traded
ownership, "the attitude [among executives] was, 'I'm not going to publish
anything, I'm not going to see investors, I'm just doing my job. I get a bonus on
performance, not on share price'". Before 1990, companies were nominally owned by
the state, but effectively were private fiefdoms of the management. Even after
privatization, managers bred under this system "still thought that the company
was owned by them, that it was their baby and everyone else should shut up",
Sitanyi says.

<P> He offers an example: when companies first began compiling IAS accounts, they
found that the results were normally worse than those indicated by Hungarian
standards, since IAS frequently requires higher provisioning and depreciation.
"Many of the Hungarian companies happily published their results in Hungarian,
but wouldn't publish the IAS. What is the point to pay for the audit and stick it
into your cupboard? They told us, 'It's management information, you shouldn't ask
for that.' We pointed out that, yes, management had asked for it, but the
shareholders had paid for it."

<P> "That sort of attitude has changed substantially," says Sitanyi, though not
necessarily out of altruism. In part, management stock option schemes have
motivated executives to focus on share prices. And managers have also watched as
the market rewarded well behaved companies with more capital. "A couple have
raised more than two times. They realize that it is in their best interest and
that when they come to the market again, investors will remember," he says.

<P> Finally, investors have rewarded cooperative managers with higher stock
prices. Krisztina Kozma, a manager of CS First Boston's Central European Growth
Fund, suggests that an uncommunicative but fundamentally good company might add
10% to its stock price simply by improving its shareholder relations. Her fund,
which had $242 million in assets at the end of June, had 30.9% of its money
deployed in Hungary.

<P> Good corporate governance doesn't simply mean a communicative management,
however. To earn the market's respect, management in turn has to be in control of
its company's affairs. In this regard, oil and gas company Mol, Hungary's biggest
enterprise, has seen some of its executives' attempts at openness backfire.

<P> After flotation a year ago, the company created a shareholder relations
department and now generally gets high marks for its openness. But the company
has handed foreign investors and investment bankers some rude shocks. The first
surprise came last summer after investment bankers had scoured the company in
preparation for the state's sale of 20% of the company to international
institutional investors.

<P> <B>Out of the ballpark</B>

<P> When analysts visited the company, managers said that it had made Ft8.1
billion in the first half of the year, recalls Jakab. "Then they said 'No, no,
no, we made Ft6.7 billion' and then during the issue they said it was Ft4.1
billion. It's a huge difference." Double counting of revenues from one division
accounted for much of the error.

<P> December brought another shock, says Jakab. Zoltan Mandoki, president of the
company, said he "was expecting net earnings of between Ft6.5 and Ft7 billion for
1995. He didn't specify Hungarian or IAS." By the time the numbers were totted
up, earnings were actually Ft1.07 billion. "Between Ft6.5 billion and Ft7 billion
is not in the general ballpark of Ft1.07 [billion]," recalls Jakab. "So you ask
yourself how can a company, eleven and a half months into the year, predict it
would make that much? What kind of controls do they have, what kind of
accounting?"

<P> Companies listed on the BSE may be at the cutting edge in the region, but
that doesn't mean that institutional investors don't occasionally get mugged in
Budapest. There is little legal protection for minority shareholders and the
securities regulators in Budapest lack teeth.

<P> Fotex has been foreign investors' roughest ride. Three year's ago, it was an
emerging market darling, attracting early investments from everyone from George
Soros to the US government-funded Hungarian American Enterprise Fund. Fotex
offered a sophisticated pitch: glossy annual reports in English, full of pithy
comments about the company's prime positioning &#173; as a retailer of up-market
consumer goods &#173; to partake in an expected boom in the Hungarian economy.
Fotex's huge retailing real estate holdings further stoked investor interest.
Backed with such stories, the company did a large offering of shares at Ft500
apiece in April 1994.

<P> It was downhill from there. The company's ambitions for profit were
slaughtered by an 11% contraction in average real earnings in 1995. Moreover,
some investors lost faith in management. A report issued by Nomura Research
Institute in January 1994 highlighted a series of ambiguous transactions between
Fotex and its biggest shareholder, a company owned by Fotex president Gabor
Varszegi. Varszegi's behavior at the AGM last year reinforced shareholder
uneasiness, when he engineered a series of measures which meant that without 75%
of the company's shares no one could turn out the company's board. With Varszegi
controlling roughly 30% of the company, the move effectively "cemented" Varszegi
and his board in place, says Jakab.

<P> Investors have voted with their feet, stampeding out of Fotex shares. At
Ft120 a share (one tenth the issue price in hard currency terms) as of late
August, Fotex trades at a deep discount to its potential value. It now trades at
just twice net cash per share, notes Jakab. It has a very strong balance sheet
and "the value of its real estate and leaseholdings probably makes the stock
worth in the region of Ft400 at least. But then again what kind of value is going
to accrue to the shareholder?"

<P> If board machinations helped torpedo investor confidence in Fotex, they also
hold the key to the further development of Hungarian corporate culture, analysts
say. "To find somebody who is really good and is not sitting on any board, and
fulfils all the requirements is a hell of a job," says Andras Simor, head of
Creditanstalt Securities Budapest. Executives at banks and brokerage houses are
forbidden by law from participating in the boards of companies traded on the
exchange. Beyond, the pool of potential board candidates is considerably smaller
than it might be in the west. Because of the recent transition, "in Hungary there
are few people who have a long, successful track record in this environment",
says Simor.

<P> The pool is further drained by the realities of Hungarian education which
funnels most bright young people through just a few universities. By the time
they reach 30, most Hungarians feel like they know, all too well, everyone in
their respective sphere of interest.

<P> "Hungary is a small country with few experts in every field and so there is
no competition for these [board] positions," says Peter Mihalyi, formerly the
chief economist at the State Privatization and Holding Company (APVRt) and now
chief economist at Bank Austria-GiroCredit Budapest. "So how can you get someone
on the board who is independent? People who are qualified technically, have the
management experience, [and] have the financial experience &#173; they are deeply
entrenched in the lobbies and industry structures."

<P> Putting a good board in place is not the end of investors' worries. Who
teaches a board what its job is? Simor says board members must, like everyone
else in Hungary in the new economy, "learn by doing".

<P> "Everything we learnt in the last six years was by making mistakes and
hopefully doing better the next time," he says. Some boards, unfortunately, have
erred on the side of doing nothing. "It happens all over the world. The board
member says, 'I've got a nice relationship with the management, I get my board
fees, I get my cigars every three months at the board meeting.'"

<P> Simor notes that the board of Ibusz, the first company floated on the BSE in
June of 1990, didn't lift a finger as the travel company's management steered the
company from disaster to disaster in subsequent years and the company's price
fell from its initial offering price of Ft4,500 to Ft950. "For me it was an
obvious case for the responsibility of the board to stand up and say, 'We either
need a serious change in strategy or we need a new management'," he explains.
"But it lasted six years before something happened and it wasn't the board that
did it." The board and management were finally turned out only after Ibusz was
taken over by another Hungarian company.

<P> <B>Last hurdle</B>

<P> Few experiences are so bad, but Simor notes that "boards in Hungary in public
companies and companies without controlling shareholders really haven't started
to function in earnest.... I think a lot more time will have to pass before
boards function more effectively."

<P> In theory, board members of Hungarian companies are liable up to the full
extent of their personal wealth. In practice, no one interviewed for this article
had ever heard of that happening. "It is too strict and because it is so strict
it's unrealistic," says Mihalyi.

<P> There's a final hurdle in the transformation of Hungary's corporate culture.
Even as the number of private  and foreign companies in Hungary swells, a core of
companies ranging from media to utilities, to key manufacturers, to agriculture
remain in state hands.

<P> That leads to a problem. Board memberships at state-owned companies are a key
perk for mid-and low-level government officials. While the top three tiers of
ministry officials are forbidden from serving on company boards, the salaries of
more junior staffers are often almost doubled by pay from board memberships
handed out by their minister, Mihalyi says. A head of a ministry department may
make Ft90,000 ($600) monthly, with several board memberships each adding an
additional Ft30,000 to Ft40,000 to that base. Or the person might serve on the
board of one large company, earning Ft100,000 monthly, Mihalyi says. Such board
membership may carry other perks like a car, a portable phone  or a secretary.

<P> The practice creates incompetent boards, since board memberships are often
distributed willy-nilly among ministry staffers, says Mihalyi. "It doesn't really
matter [what your area of expertise is], they put you where there is a place. So,
that of course creates all sorts of confusion. A guy lands in a totally different
industry that he doesn't know anything about. He is not even interested, so he
just goes to the meetings and gets the money."

<P> But the situation has a flip side. Board members from a given ministry may
become too interested in their company, says Mihalyi. "After two or three months,
these people start to love the company and they become the lobbyist of the
company with the government. So a Mol board member [for example], who is a
ministry official, will do everything he can to lobby the government for Mol,
rather than lobbying for the government in Mol."

<P> But Gabor Baranyai, who has attended two board meetings since he was elected
to serve as one of two board representatives of foreign shareholders on Mol's
11-person board, says he's been pleasantly surprised by his experience so far.
"The biggest surprise is that those 11 people are really committed," he says.
"After two months, I found that people are competent. Everybody has a special
field that makes a contribution to the board."

<P> Baranyai, a systems engineer, worked for Mol, attended business school in the
US and then worked for the International Finance Corporation (IFC), before taking
his current job at a telecom investment fund created by IFC. With all that
preparation, however, the 40-year-old still says he's nearly overwhelmed by the
challenges of serving on Mol's board.

<P> "Right now, I spend half my time preparing [for meetings]," he says. "The
board meetings are like a university exam. You make notes, you study. Sometimes
[afterwards] you feel like you did well. Other times you feel like you should
have focussed more on something else in your studying." There is at least one
difference between university tests and board meetings, says Baranyai. "In
university, you get a grade quickly. But in a company, you have to wait years to
see if you made the right decisions." Hungary, too, will have to wait several
years to receive its grade in Corporate Governance 101.                          
                     *

<H2> <B>Flawed but functional laws</B> </H2> <P> Hungary suffers from being ahead
of its time. Like a manufacturer which adopts a new technology early on, only to
watch its competitors install newer, better versions soon after, Hungary &#173;
once a regional leader in legal innovation &#173; now finds itself making do with
antiquated laws.

<P> Andras Simor, head of Creditanstalt Securities Budapest, confronts this daily
in dealing within his country's securities laws. He laments that short-selling,
securities lending and nominee trading are all still forbidden by Hungary's
securities law, which was passed in early 1990.

<P> "In 1989 and 1990, Hungary was a pioneer in establishing and reforming its
legal system, preceding events of the market. That helped the market grow very
fast. In terms of the securities legislation, the market has now overtaken the
system and the system is hindering further development."

<P> That law was part of a long crescendo of legislation that constituted
Hungary's transition to free market democracy. In 1984, the government issued a
decree giving greater autonomy to its companies; in 1988, it introduced the
corporate act and an act permitting foreign investment; in 1990, laws on
securities trading and privatization; and in 1991, laws codifying bankruptcy and
accounting.

<P> <B>Left to bureaucrats</B>

<P> But the legal innovations slowed soon after 1991. Having helped launch
capitalism, the aggressive young men and women who had pushed the government
along from the inside gravitated to the private sector's big money and
excitement, leaving the law-writing to bureaucrats. Simor left the National Bank
to run Creditanstalt. Zsigmond Jarai who, as deputy minister of finance, helped
draft the act which permitted a stock exchange, went to work as an investment
banker for James Capel. Today Jarai is chairman of the Budapest Stock Exchange.

<P> With many flawed but functional laws on the books, the temptation has been to
stretch and fiddle, rather than rebuild. Why fool with <I>de jure</I> when<I> de
facto</I> works? Such <I>sub rosa</I> innovation comes naturally to Hungarians.
In the most tolerant regime of the Soviet bloc, the rule was very often simply,
"don't get caught". During the 1970s and 1980s, the authorities increasingly
turned a blind eye to capitalist innovations in the hope that such flexibility
might save their system. (The state's often schizophrenic approach to law
enforcement persists. Even today, the state radio station regularly broadcasts
the location of police speed traps.)

<P> Corporate law is still, in the large part, governed by the 1988 Act on
Corporations. For its time, the act was revolutionary. In a country that was
still nominally communist, the act laid down western-style rules for everything
from takeovers to the election of corporate boards. Now, however, corporate
lawyers in Budapest are churning out a growing body of practice that either
stretches or contradicts the law. Companies &#173; at least those who understand
the problem &#173; are holding their breath to see when and how the courts will
rule.

<P> For example, the company law of 1988, in theory, obligates one Rt (the
Hungarian equivalent of Ltd) buying a majority of another Rt's shares to offer
the same price and terms to all minority shareholders. In the last 18 months, the
big question has been, should this be taken literally and applied only to
Hungarian companies, or should Rt be translatable and thus apply to all Ltds. If
so, the law would apply to foreign companies which purchased more than $1 billion
of privatized companies last year, obligating the foreigners to buy out minority
shareholders. Although the purchases took place nine months ago, a final court
ruling may not come for yet another year.

<P> "The law is clearly deficient," says Simor. "If an Rt takes over another Rt,
you have this obligation. But if a private person buys a company, then there is
no duty. So it would be very easy to avoid the problem. Even a 10-year-old could
find the solution to this problem."

<P> With the exception of a few clauses, Hungary lacks a full takeover code. A
comprehensive code was included in early drafts of a new securities law, but as
the number of drafts now approaches 20, takeover provisions have dropped out,
much to the brokerage community's dismay.

<P> Last winter, Creditanstalt advised Bristol-Myers on its purchase of
Pharmavit, a Hungarian drug company. Side-stepping any apparent ambiguities in
the law, Bristol-Myers simply applied UK takeover rules, which are far more
stringent than those now in place in Hungary, and bid for the whole company.

<P> Even as corporate law remains stuck in 1988, practice is creeping forward
every day in law offices around Budapest. In many cases, the innovations come in
something as basic as a company's articles of association, which determine a
company's corporate governance and must be registered at the court of
registration. Many articles of association currently in use create new mechanisms
which are not necessarily encompassed in the current law, says a Budapest
corporate lawyer.

<P> <B>Untested</B>

<P> This creates a hazard. "Even if the court of registration registers special
rules, they haven't been tried in normal court," the lawyer says. Given the
chance, a conservative judge might well throw the practice out,  he says. The
attorney spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he did not want to be seen to be
discouraging any potential investors in Hungary.

<P> The court of registration only registers a company's articles of association
six to 18 months after they are filed. If the court requests a change in the
articles, an applicant faces a choice: appeal and wait another two years or
simply change its articles of association to make the court happy. Lawyers
recommend biting the court-ordered bullet. Asked how long an appeal would take,
the lawyer laughs. "I've never tried it. One year for sure, maybe two or three,"
he says.

<P> With corporate lawyers and the companies they advise taking the path of least
resistance &#173; judges are not challenged to broaden and interpret the law. A
gap is opening between the law as recognized by the courts' practice and as
implemented by corporations, the lawyer said. Sooner or later, a new law will be
written that validates corporate lawyers' innovations, the lawyer says.

<P> Asked if eight years of innovations might simply be overturned, the lawyer
replies, "that's impossible". <B><I>&#173; HC</I></B>

<H2>Banking's real climbers </H2>
Not content to climb simply within their own organizations, a growing number
of bankers are to be found digging their crampons into the ice of some of
the world's most perilous mountains. <BR>
<BR>
Standard Chartered's chief executive Malcolm Williamson managed to squeeze
a week off work in 1994 to climb Africa's highest summit, 5,900-metre (19,400-foot)
Kilimanjaro. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I had to go into a fax-free zone for a week,&quot; says 56-year-old
Williamson. &quot;This would not have made me too popular with my chairman
had there been a bid for the bank in my absence.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He says he found it a liberating experience: &quot;There were few opportunities
to worry about the bank on Kilimanjaro. I came back physically exhausted
but mentally recharged. You need to have a real break, even if it's only
a week.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mark Warham, 34-year-old corporate finance director at Schroders, has been
climbing for the past 14 years. He recently returned from an ascent of 4,900-metre
Mount Vinson, Antarctica's highest peak, where temperatures were as low
as minus 30oF - without taking account of the wind-chill factor. <BR>
<BR>
Warham's summit record is Nepal's 7,200-metre Pumori, although he climbed
higher on Everest before having to retreat with pulmonary oedema. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You can draw some analogies between success in business and mountaineering,&quot;
he says. &quot;In both activities, you have to be focused and able to cut
away the periphery. People who are successful in business are driven people
and that translates itself into drive in another environment.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Stephen Bell, director of UK-based Himalayan Kingdoms, takes an increasing
number of bankers on mountaineering expeditions. Bell's guided tours have
even placed one banker on the 8,848-metre summit of Everest. Scott McIvor,
an executive with National Commercial Bank in Jeddah, paid $20,000 to exchange
Saudi Arabian sand for a view from the top of the world. <BR>
<BR>
Michael Pitcher, Barclays' 53-year-old deputy managing director of UK banking
services and another Kilimanjaro summiteer, also believes there is a link
between the conquest of mountains and business success. &quot;There are
a lot of similarities,&quot; he says. &quot;For one thing, a mountaineer
is the sort of person who is constantly seeking the next challenge in life.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Pitcher's next goal is Europe's highest peak, 5,600-metre Elbrus in the
Caucasus. &quot;It's really a function of time,&quot; he says. &quot;It
normally requires two or three weeks but, looking at my time-constraint,
it will have to be done in a week or so.&quot; <B>Jules Stewart<BR>

<H2>CS First Boston's football field </H2>
CS First Boston, never one to run with the crowd, is set to move to an area
of New York not normally associated with investment banking. In fact, there
are no other banks in the Flatiron district where CS First Boston will move
in 1996 when the lease runs out on its Park Avenue Plaza building. <BR>
<BR>
The new building, called the MetLife, is in Madison Avenue, territory where
red braces and cufflinks are less common than berets and telephoto lenses.
The area houses some of New York's most chic caf&eacute;s and also boasts
a number of model agencies, including Elite, which has on its books most
of the world's supermodels. <BR>
<BR>
A helpful secretary at one top international modelling agency describes
the district as &quot;a nice trendy area with a good mix of apartment blocks,
fashion houses and furniture stores&quot;. She couldn't recall ever having
seen any investment bankers. <BR>
<BR>
The attraction for CS First Boston is the prospect of being able to redevelop
the 28-storey MetLife Building. &quot;Yes, we are staking out new territory,&quot;
says an enthusiastic spokesperson, &quot;but we are also creating one of
the world's biggest private trading floors.&quot; The renovation process
will cost $300 million. <BR>
<BR>
The move was engineered by Dom Prezzano, the senior vice-president who heads
MetLife's corporate property group. At first he received little encouragement
from a banker he knew at CS First Boston who responded: &quot;I don't think
we could ever get our investment bankers to go to midtown south.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But Prezzano made the bankers change their minds when he showed them the
potential: &quot;I stood them underneath these holes we had cut and told
them to look up, and I was able to show them clear ceiling heights of 16
feet eight inches. I then had them stand in the middle of the floor and
we looked from Madison Avenue to Park Avenue and from 24th to 25th street.
And they couldn't believe it. If this were a football field, you're looking
at one that is 140 yards long and 64 yards wide. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's really what whet their appetite for the building.&quot; <B>Steven
Irvine<BR>
<BR>
</B><BR>
<H2>Rich man, poor man </H2>
Kichinosuke Sasaki delights in flouting convention. So what if his property
company, Togensha, has debts of &#165;389 billion ($3.83 billion) and for
the past four years has rung up net losses totalling another $2 billion?
His Japanese creditors may be pulling out their hair but not Sasaki. &quot;There's
been no change in my lifestyle. None at all,&quot; he breezes. <BR>
<BR>
Just as during the heyday of Japan's bubble, when <I>Forbes</I> ranked him
as one of the world's billionaires, Sasaki is still chauffeured to work
in a pink Mercedes. His office carpet is also pink. Bottles of expensive
brandy line one wall. <BR>
<BR>
The secret of his equanimity is that &quot;I'm too big to fail&quot;. Sasaki
gets to keep his 104 buildings and a golf course because the likes of Mitsui
Trust and Banking (owed $259 million by Togensha), Industrial Bank of Japan
($233 million), Long-Term Credit Bank ($219 million) and Mitsubishi Trust
and Banking ($13.5 million) are terrified of adding to their bad-loan books
by foreclosing on their loans. <BR>
<BR>
In 1991 Sasaki unilaterally announced to his 46 creditors that he would
&quot;pay only a sliver of interest&quot; on his debt. &quot;I am paying
two-fifths of the prime rate,&quot; he confides. The prime rate itself is
now only 2.8%. <BR>
<BR>
Even more brazen is the criminal law suit Sasaki has brought, together with
seven other strapped Japanese tycoons belonging to his Association for the
Rebuilding of Japan's Economy, against the Bank of Japan and the ministry
of finance (MoF). They are demanding $876 million in damages from the Japanese
government for destroying their fortunes or, as Sasaki prefers to put it,
&quot;violating our right, under Article 29 of the constitution, to own
assets&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Sasaki argues that Japan's 1980s bubble was engineered by the government
and that it was the MoF'S U-turn in suddenly tightening monetary policy
which caused land prices to collapse and nearly forced firms like Togensha
to the wall. <BR>
<BR>
A medical postgraduate of the prestigious Keio University, Sasaki ran his
own Tokyo clinic - specializing in &quot;brain metabolism&quot; - before
catching the property fever and starting Togensha in 1980. During the bubble,
he drove a jeep up Italian mountains to pick marble personally for his Tokyo
buildings. <BR>
<BR>
Sasaki himself will admit to no misjudgements. He remains proud of his greatest
failure, the 10-floor Kamata Building which runs alongside Kamata railway
station in southern Tokyo and whose exterior is finished in polished marble
and gold trim. The building cost $916 million to construct and was finally
sold in April 1994 to a consortium of creditors for $384 million. For the
past three years, it has stood empty. Sasaki still considers it a visionary
achievement. <B>Peter McGill<BR>
<BR>
</B><BR>
<H2>Australian elephant </H2>
The proposed sale by the Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB) of Japan of some distressed
assets it inherited in Queensland has caused tempers to flare in the Australian
senate. Liberal Party senator John Tierney of New South Wales terms it a
&quot;threat to national interests&quot; and a ploy to &quot;change, by
stealth, higher education policy&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The publicity-shy Japanese bankers of LTCB never intended to become embroiled
in the rough-and-tumble of Australian politics. By default, though, LTCB
has become landlord of Bond University, Australia's first private university,
which it wants to sell as quickly as possible. <BR>
<BR>
Blame Harunori Takahashi, the flashy Japanese property developer and former
head of EIE International, for LTCB's embarrassment. Also blame LTCB for
lending Takahashi billions of dollars during Japan's bubble, then pulling
the plug in 1993 leaving EIE with a mountain of unpaid debts. <BR>
<BR>
It all started 10 years ago when Takahashi formed a partnership with the
equally flamboyant Australian speculator Alan Bond. The Queensland parliament
passed the Bond University Act, allowing Bond and Takahashi to set up a
joint A$200 million ($148 million) development with the university as a
centrepiece. This was supposed to drive up the value of surrounding pine
forests for residential and commercial development. <BR>
<BR>
But, by 1989, when Bond University opened to fee-paying students, Bond had
moved from trophy acquisitions to fire-sales in a desperate bid to stay
afloat. Takahashi generously helped to stem Bond's cash haemorrhage, including
paying A$55 million to buy the university. Soon afterwards, Bond was imprisoned
in Australia on fraud charges. Takahashi spoke dismissively of Bond University
as a &quot;white elephant&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Takahashi is also now in police detention and is charged with a breach of
trust in a loan scandal. <BR>
<BR>
LTCB's past efforts to sell the Bond University campus have failed. A young
LTCB banker dispatched to Australia to try to sell it and other EIE assets
died in January 1994. <BR>
<BR>
This time, LTCB was confident it had sold the campus to the neighbouring
public University of Queensland for the knock-down price of A$109 million.
But Bond University itself, where Takahashi is still a council member, is
strongly opposed to the sale. Powerful Australian business backers - including
BHP, ICM and Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd - have joined a consortium with Bond
University to block the sale in the courts and make a counterbid. Along
with the white elephant, LTCB now has enemies it could do without. <B>PMcG<BR>

</B><BR>
<H2>The Euro-Euro </H2>
The politicians who decided on it couldn't have been expected to know, but
the forthcoming European single currency, the Euro, will pose a serious
problem to the Euromarkets. <BR>
<BR>
It could kill the Eurobond - in name, at least. <BR>
<BR>
Come 1999, if monetary union happens (a big &quot;if&quot; admittedly),
European currencies such as the Deutschmark, French franc and sterling will
die, as will Euro-Deutschmark, Euro-French franc and Euro-sterling bonds.
<BR>
<BR>
The single currency will result in three main categories of international
bonds: dollar bonds, yen bonds and Euro bonds (ie, bonds in Euros). Could
they be called Euro Eurobonds? It sounds unlikely. <BR>
<BR>
The change will also mean that, when bankers talk about the Euromarket,
the term will cover only bonds issued in Euros. In future, will a Euro-currency
imply a currency held in accounts outside its country of origin or the currency
of the European Union? <BR>
<BR>
Inevitably, it seems, the term Eurobond will have to be dropped. Replacement
candidates include the unsnappy &quot;international bond&quot;. Or what
about submitting to the obvious and calling it an MTN? <B>SI </B><p>

<HTML> <HEAD><TITLE>Vanuatu</TITLE></HEAD> <BODY>


<P> <B>A SUPPLEMENT TO EUROMONEY/AUGUST 1996</B>

<H3> Vanuatu: the serious side of paradise</H3>
<p> <H3>Time to get better known </H3>
<p> <H4><B>Since independence in 1980, Vanuatu has established a reputation as one of
the most stable Pacific island countries. Its government is now promoting 
the islands as a tourist destination and offshore financial centre. Ben Davies reports from
Port-Vila</B> </H4> 

<P> When prime minister Maxime Carlot Korman took power in
Vanuatu in February, he inherited what should in theory be one of the brightest
economic stars in the Pacific. Vanuatu not only plays host to the
longest-established offshore financial centre in the region, but also boasts some
of the biggest tourist attractions. These factors together with political
stability have ensured steady growth.

<P> Last year, GDP rose by an estimated 2.5%. This year, according to the Reserve
Bank of Vanuatu, it is projected to increase by 3%. There is plenty of other
potential. More than 2,500 companies are now registered under the favourable
terms of the International Companies Act. Together with offshore banking,
insurance and the trust business, these directly contribute over Vt280 million
($200 million) to government revenue.

<P> Nevertheless Vanuatu remains heavily reliant on overseas aid. Last year,
according to the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu, it totalled Vt3.5 billion, some 15% of
GDP. This year it is likely to be at a similar level. And although the budget is
balanced, financial constraints could hinder development.

<P> "Vanuatu has fantastic potential, but it hasn't been promoted enough," says
Garry Tunstall, managing director of ANZ, Vanuatu's largest bank in terms of
assets. "We are a magical tourist destination. The finance centre could also be
the tip of the iceberg."

<P> Formerly known as the New Hebrides, the 84 islands that make up Vanuatu
("Land Eternal") were until 1980 jointly governed by the French and British under
a system which involved two official languages, two police forces and two
administrations. Vanuatu's common law is based on the British model but it has
two languages of administration which rank as official &#173; French and English
&#173; and a third official language, Bislama.

<P> Since independence on July 30 1980, Vanuatu has been administered by a
democratically-elected government. After national elections in November last
year, the previous ruling party, the Union of Moderate Parties, formed a new
government under prime minister Serge Vohor. But following the decision by a
coalition partner to switch sides, he resigned. A new coalition is now in place
headed by the previous prime minister, Maxime Carlot Korman.

<P> This administration has got off to an inauspicious start to its four-year
term, with the prime minister facing two lawsuits, one over a political issue and
the other relating to an expatriate lawyer who was asked to leave the country. On
top of this there is the possible fallout from a $100 million swindle said to
have been inflicted on the government by an Australian posing as an investment
manager. On the promise of high returns, senior government leaders were persuaded
to issue letters of credit that are now circulating internationally. The expected
profits never came through. In a report on the incident, national ombudsman
Marie-No&euml;lle Ferrieux-Patterson urged the president to sack the reserve bank
governor, the finance minister and the finance secretary, and to reprimand
Korman.

<P> Nevertheless the government has set itself ambitious goals. These include
rapid growth through stimulation of investment in export-oriented ventures and
commercialization of the public sector.

<P> "The government would like to see Vanuatu placed at a world-class level,"
says attorney general Oliver Saksak. "Up till now they have been in the process
of settling down. But in future they will be implementing laws and policies to
strengthen the economy."

<P> Those policies are likely to have continuity with the National Development
Plan (1992-96), which sought to strengthen the key agricultural sector. The
government will also be looking to encourage foreign investment in tourist
facilities as well as developing the financial services industry, which is in
need of an overhaul.

<P> Vanuatu already has laws favourable to foreign enterprise, including
exemptions from income tax, corporate tax, estate duty, gift duty and capital
gains tax, and there are no restrictions on repatriation of funds. The challenge
will be to build on this legislation to compete with other offshore
jurisdictions.

<P> "The absence of taxes, duties and controls, coupled with state-of-the-art
communications and highly-developed professional services, makes Vanuatu an ideal
centre for foreign investors to base their surplus funds for investment or to
base offshore companies forming part of a wider international or financial
network," says a recent report by accountants Stafford &amp; Associates. "The
Vanuatu government is extremely active in its support of the Financial Centre
Association [a local professional body] because of its importance to the Vanuatu
economy and is committed to making the country the Pacific's foremost tax haven."

<P> Developing the economy on other fronts is likely to prove more difficult.
Vanuatu has a population of 160,000 spread over 70 inhabited islands. Its total
land area is 12,173 sq km. The scattered population and land mass have made
infrastructure development difficult. Many of the rural areas are served by poor
roads and an intermittent electricity supply. Vanuatu's isolation from large
markets has also limited its ability to develop manufacturing.

<P> At independence the new government inherited a country with few hospitals,
schools, telecommunications or other vital social infrastructure. Worse still,
the dual administration bequeathed a bloated public sector that successive
governments have been unable to trim down. Although the government would like to
raise educational standards, strengthen healthcare and improve infrastructure, it
has been held back by lack of funds. "Politically we were ready for independence,
but financially we were not," says Kalpokor Kalsakau, a former minister of
finance, now manager of Cabinet d'Affaires du Pacifique, a domestic think-tank.

<P> Agriculture and fishing are the most significant economic sectors, providing
work for more than 80% of the population. In 1994, 24,000 tons of copra were
produced, representing an estimated 6% of GDP. Despite recent price declines,
copra production is still the largest employer.

<P> The country's second-largest source of foreign exchange is beef, accounting
for more than 20% of commodity exports by value in 1994. Customers include Japan,
New Caledonia and Papua New Guinea. Following the completion of new abattoirs,
the country is gearing up for export to the EU.

<P> Other export commodities include cocoa, coffee and timber.  The government is
keen to promote manufacturing, with special emphasis on import substitution and
export promotion. Key areas reckoned to have potential include soap production,
food processing and timber industries. Expensive electricity and
telecommunications are not compensated for by a buoyant domestic market, which is
small. As a result much of the manufacturing sector has traditionally been
supported by government subsidies.

<P> "The present cost structure is not conducive to rapid expansion in the
future," says a report by Bank of Hawaii published in late 1995. "Under
conditions which include artificially high wages, only those segments of industry
that cater to domestic demand tend to perform well."

<P> Indeed the main component of government revenues is import and export duties
together with business licence and company registration fees. As of 1995, these
contributed around 60% of GDP and as much as 40% of total public spending. The
government also earns substantial revenue from turnover taxes from hotels,
licensed premises and casinos. These revenues are backed up by foreign aid,
especially from Australia and France.

<P> By pursuing stable economic policies, successive governments have placed
Vanuatu in a relatively healthy financial position. After recording a budget
deficit of 8.7% in 1989, the gap fell to 5.9% in 1991. Since then the government
has been able to balance its budget. Inflation reached a high of 8.7% in 1988 and
is currently around 3%.

<P> Mining could have a major economic impact. Vanuatu's location along the
Pacific volcanic belt has long prompted hopes for gold and copper production. But
until recently, prospecting for base and precious metals was sporadic and on a
small scale. Now, following the discovery of gold deposits at other locations
along the Rim of Fire, exploration has been stepped up.

<P> Companies prospecting in Vanuatu include Placer Pacific, Aberfoyle Resources,
BHP, Union Mining, Wattle Gully Mining and Minerals International. "If one or two
prospectors strike, it could provide a windfall in government revenues," says
Stafford.

<P> It could also help provide much-needed employment  &#173; population growth
reached a high of 3.1% between 1967 and 1979, slowed to 2.4% between 1979 and
1989, but is now up again to 3.1%.

<P> Balancing the budget is also likely to prove increasingly difficult as aid
money and technical assistance decline, and demand for funds to improve roads and
schools increases.

<P> One way to preserve valuable funds would be to do away with the expensive
system of two main official languages, which affects education and administration
of justice. Another means of tightening expenditure would be to trim the public
service, which employs more than 4,500 people.

<P> By far the most controversial issue is taxation. Since independence, the
government has relied on indirect taxes for most of its revenues. However, high
indirect taxes have squeezed a small proportion of the population, while high
subsidies have led to inefficiencies in other areas. "Recent studies suggest that
an overhaul of the tax system is needed to include new direct personal and
corporate income and sales taxes especially if the government is to achieve the
goals outlined in the Third Development Plan," says a report by Bank of Hawaii.

<P> Lack of resources is already forcing the government to take a more pragmatic
view of the financial services industry. "Historically the government was too
busy with independence and with the immediate job of governing to come to grips
with the financial industry," says Adrian Sinclair, a partner at accountants BDO
Barrett &amp; Sinclair. "Now it realizes that if tourism and the financial
industry are to contribute larger amounts to revenues, then it must provide more
active support to them."

<P> Sinclair believes there is a broad consensus within government to promote the
industry: "In the past, we have had a highly-regulated finance sector and
virtually no problems. But we have not really been going anywhere. Now we have an
experienced finance minister and a commissioner determined to get on with
things."

<P> Like Sinclair, the business community in Vanuatu is pinning its hopes on new
finance minister Barak Sope. Sope has considerable experience of running private
businesses and is believed to be far more committed to developing Vanuatu as a
financial centre than some of his predecessors. Furthermore he is backed up by
the respected head of the financial services commission, Julian Ala.

<P> Outside Australasia, most people have never heard of Vanuatu. Of those who
have, few realize that it has been an offshore financial centre for 25 years.
"When I visit the United States most people say Vana who?" says Juris Ozols, of
law firm Juris Ozols &amp; Associates. "That is good because we don't get the
scams of the Caribbean. But it also means we don't get the business."

<P> Better marketing of tourism and more investment in it could pay big
dividends. There were some 43,000 tourist arrivals in 1995 but poor government
funding and limited air links have been major constraints. "Tourism offers
instant capital," says Rick Graham, manager of Iririki Island Resort. "If you
spent an extra million dollars on it, you would probably get more than four
million back."

<H3> Room for growth offshore </H3>
<p><H4><B>Having lost out on business to other offshore financial centres, Vanuatu is
pinning its hopes on new legislation to restore its competitive edge</B> </H4> 

<P> Ask most people about offshore financial centres and they may come up with the British Virgin Islands or the Bahamas. Mention
Vanuatu and it's more than likely to draw a blank. Yet Vanuatu began offering
offshore financial services before both of these    better-known jurisdictions.
And though growth may have slowed, Vanuatu continues to attract new players
because of the broad scope of its offshore products. "In terms of revenue we are
extremely successful," says Julian Ala, head of the financial services
commission. "Compared with other jurisdictions we are flexible, competitive and
relatively low-priced."

<P> Since 1971, when the financial services industry was established by the
British colonial administration, it has grown into a significant component of the
economy, second only to tourism. Vanuatu now plays host to leading international
accountants such as KPMG Peat Marwick and BDO Barrett &amp; Sinclair, as well as
eight law firms and close to a dozen trust companies. Furthermore it ranks as a
pure tax haven &#173; both residents and non-residents are exempt from personal
and corporate income tax, estate and gift duties, capital gains tax and exchange
controls.

<P> "Vanuatu is not internationally known like the British Virgin Islands," says
Geoffrey Gee, a lawyer at Geoffrey Gee and Partners. "But we have the laws in
place, we have an infrastructure that is growing and we are moving in the right
direction."

<P> At the core of Vanuatu's offshore legislation is the International Companies
Act, which came into force in March 1993 after strong lobbying from the financial
community. Under it, a Vanuatu international company (IC) can have a single
incorporator as well as a single member. ICs are not required to hold annual
general meetings or to lodge annual returns. Furthermore, there is no requirement
to maintain a register of directors in Vanuatu. Funds may be moved freely in and
out. To register under the legislation, companies or individuals are simply
required to supply details of the company's name, its objectives, its registered
office and agent.

<P> According to local officials, there are plenty of other attractions. An IC
may transfer its assets to trustees acting on behalf of third parties. It may
issue share warrants in registered or bearer form as well as purchasing or
redeeming its own shares without court approval. Indeed the only major
requirement for an IC is that it should remain solvent.

<P> Compared with other jurisdictions, Vanuatu's IC is also cost-competitive.
Companies incorporating in Vanuatu are charged $150 on registration. Every year
they pay a further government registration fee of $300. That compares with a fee
of between $150 and $1,000 in the British Virgin Islands, which is at present the
most popular corporate domicile. "Unlike the British Virgin Islands we have no
par value or authorized capital," says Thomas Bayer, executive chairman of
Pacific International Trust Company (Pitco). "We don't have subscribers. We have
incorporators and the incorporator is deemed to be the shareholder."

<P> Pitco was incorporated in 1972 and has become Vanuatu's most successful
financial services company, with activities ranging from trustee services and
private banking to company formation and management, fund management and maritime
shipping. Today, besides its operation in Vanuatu, Pitco has offices in Hong
Kong, Kuala Lumpur, London and New York. "Our legislation is as competitive as
the British Virgin Islands, but it has not been successfully marketed," says
Bayer.

<P> Bayer sees other advantages. No double-taxation agreements have ever been
made with other countries. And breach of confidentiality is considered a criminal
act. "So long as I am assured that my client is bona fide, I can offer complete
confidentiality," says Juris Ozols, an attorney at Juris Ozols &amp; Associates.
"That is not always the case in other jurisdictions."

<P> Ozols, who has been practising in Vanuatu since 1992, believes that Vanuatu's
company legislation is backed up by political stability as well as highly
professional service from banks, lawyers and accountants. "The International
Companies Act is as flexible as any other companies act around the world that
works within the common law system," he says. "Vanuatu does not have [special]
ties with any one government so it remains independent."

<P> Vanuatu also offers a favourable regime for banks. Under the Banking Act,
exempted banks approved by the financial services commission can carry out
banking transactions or money-lending operations outside Vanuatu. Exempt banks
must have a minimum capital of $150,000 and a designated principal office in
Vanuatu. Furthermore they must submit audited financial results to the
commissioner every year.

<P> Captive insurance also offers considerable potential. Under the Insurance
Act, exempted insurers are subject to minimal capital requirements and net asset
requirements. Captives may be used to underwrite 100% of risk. "The Vanuatu
legislation permits exempted insurance companies to be easily formed, allowing
for complete flexibility and with no restriction on the captive's investment
policy," says a report by accountants Stafford &amp; Associates.

<P> Vanuatu's financial services industry has been successful in tapping new
sources of revenue but it has failed to live up to expectations. As of June 1996,
only 2,500 companies were registered in Vanuatu along with 80 exempt or offshore
banks. That compares with the 176,000 international business companies registered
in the British Virgin Islands. "Vanuatu had a head start, but it has lost
momentum," says Bayer. "Historically the government has not put money into
promoting the financial centre. Now other jurisdictions have taken the lead."

<P> Marketing has not been the only problem. Vanuatu's legislation has also
failed to keep up with the times. Aside from the International Companies Act,
which was enacted in 1992, many of the other laws concerning the offshore
business date back more than a decade. The laws may be sound, but in many cases
they lack the flexibility of other jurisdictions.

<P> Typical has been the case of the International Trust Law. In 1994, a new law
was drafted to improve existing legislation, making it more attractive for
overseas parties to operate trusts. But although the draft law has been widely
circulated and reviewed, it has become bogged down in the Vanuatu parliament.

<P> "Considering that the financial centre has been up and running for almost 25
years, the volume of business should be considerably higher," says the head of
one foreign institution. "But when every politician wants to debate every point,
you can't get anywhere."

<P> It's a criticism that is accepted by Ala. Since taking over as head of the
financial services commission in February 1994, he has lobbied hard for new
legislation and for more frequent parliamentary sessions in order to accelerate
the legislative process. "The political will is there, but it takes time," says
Ala, who was previously attorney general. "Over the next few years we will be
more proactive."

<P> Ala is determined to implement changes designed to revitalize the offshore
industry. Those include amendments to the Banking Act and new trust and company
management legislation. "Currently our products are already on the shelf," he
says. "People want new products and if you offer them, they will buy."

<P> Ala's stance is backed by the Vanuatu Financial Centre, an association
created by bankers, lawyers, accountants and trust companies to present a unified
voice to the government. Recently the association, which is chaired by John
Ridgeway, the representative of Clayton Utz, agreed to undertake a marketing trip
to Asia towards the end of the year to promote Vanuatu's financial services
capabilities. Members will visit Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan and other
prospective centres, possibly with the finance minister.

<P> Progress has already been made on some fronts. Following a plea from the
association and the financial services commission, the government has agreed, in
principle, to allocate resources to marketing the financial centre &#173;
something it has never done before. And although no figure has been made public,
it is believed to be in the region of Vt100 million ($71.4 million) per annum.

<P> If members have their way, the passage of key legislation may also be speeded
up. "We are now pursuing legislation with new vigour," says Adrian Sinclair,
partner at BDO Barrett &amp; Sinclair. "We virtually have the go-ahead from the
finance minister and we have never had quite that relationship before."

<P> Other revisions could also be in the offing. In the medium term,
company-management legislation is under consideration which would give the
government greater regulatory control over financial providers. In the longer
term, there may even be new legislation for mutual funds and other new products
designed to put Vanuatu on a par with other jurisdictions.

<P> "Our message to investors is this," says Sinclair. "We have been around for a
long time. We have a good reputation and an experienced group of people. We have
between two and four hours' time difference with Asia. Our legislation is
competitive even as it stands now. And we will see to it that our legislation is
more competitive in the near future." Vanuatu also has efficient
telecommunications. It now has worldwide direct-dial telephone and fax services,
telex and telegraph services and Internet connections.

<P> But although the authorities are undoubtedly keen to increase the number of
international companies registered in Vanuatu, they remain wary of misuse of the
jurisdiction. "We go for quality not quantity," says Ala. "We want to attract the
best companies and we pride ourselves on being the best centre in the Pacific."

<P> The commitment of the regulatory authorities to maintaining the country's
high standing was demonstrated in 1994 when a money-laundering incident was
uncovered. The funds, which had been laundered through a real-estate transaction
in Australia, were quickly confiscated following a decision of the Vanuatu
supreme court.

<P> Knowing the client remains a key principle that is embraced by banks, trust
companies and legal firms alike. Due diligence is carried out before any company
incorporation takes place and is then applied repeatedly throughout the
relationship. The four commercial banks have introduced new account-opening
requirements despite opposition from professionals fearing loss of business.

<P> "If our clients go wrong and we have not taken proper steps, we suffer," says
Gee. "The government is very concerned about due diligence and that is one reason
Vanuatu has never had a major problem with scandals or money-laundering."

<H3> A tighter rein on banks </H3> 
<H4> <B>The recent closure of Olilian Bank and concerns about new commercial 
banking licences have prompted revisions of Vanuatu's regulatory system. This could lead to stronger,
more transparent banking</B> </H4> 

<P> In many ways the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu operates like any other  central bank. Its responsibilities include overseeing
the banking system and currency issuance, monitoring the economy, fixing the
value of the vatu against an undisclosed basket of currencies and holding
deposits for commercial banks. But it is not the formal regulator and does not
award banking licences.

<P> Those responsibilities are the purview of the financial services commission
and the finance ministry. Under the Banking Act, they grant new commercial
banking licences, and regulate both onshore and offshore banks. This may be
changing. Following an IMF visit, moves are under way to amend the laws so that
each institution has specific roles. Under the new regulations, which are
expected to be approved by the end of the year, the reserve bank will supervise
commercial banks and the financial services commission will supervise offshore
banks.

<P> "The amendments will clarify our respective roles," says Legesse Tickeher,
director of the research department at the reserve bank. "In the past there has
been a slight overlap between the various regulatory authorities. The aim is to
address those issues and to strengthen the banking system."

<P> In the wake of recent troubles, other changes may also be in the offing for
commercial banking. These could include higher capital requirements, possibly
leading to more detailed capital adequacy regulations at a later stage. The
changes stem in part from the closure of Olilian Bank, whose licence was revoked
in July 1995 after it failed to fulfil statutory regulations laid down by the
Banking Act. Awarded a commercial banking licence by the finance ministry in
February 1995, Olilian operated for just six months.

<P> Critics claim that Olilian Bank should never even have been granted a licence
in the first place and that it used depositors' money to run the bank. "At no
stage did Olilian Bank fulfil [reasonable] capital requirements," says one
banker. "The promoters simply ingratiated themselves with the right people."
Following the collapse, the bank's Taiwanese owner absconded. With liquidation
under way losses may exceed Vt11 million ($7.9 million).

<P> "It was an extremely unfortunate incident," says Julian Ala, who as head of
the financial services commission is responsible for handling the liquidation.
"In my view Olilian Bank was just fraud."

<P> The incident has taught the regulators valuable lessons. In future, they will
reject applications from individuals wanting to set up banks. They will also
monitor more closely newly-established financial institutions. "It has made us
more wary," says Ala.

<P> In future, the spotlight may also fall on the award of a commercial banking
licence to Dragon Bank International. This was granted by the finance ministry,
despite the bank's lack of a track record. It recently had its regional
representative office licence revoked in Jakarta, Indonesia, following fraud
allegations. This decision is likely to lead to further pressure to impose more
stringent requirements and scrutiny on banks.

<P> The Olilian affair and concerns about Dragon may have strengthened the
credibility of Vanuatu's more established commercial banks. ANZ and Westpac now
account for more than 60% of domestic banks' total assets and deposits. In
December 1993 they were joined by Bank of Hawaii, which purchased an 80% stake in
the former operation of Banque Indosuez. The Vanuatu government initially held
the other 20%, but this has since been sold to Bank of Hawaii. Indosuez's
decision to withdraw from Vanuatu did not stem from poor local operating
conditions but was part of a general withdrawal from the Pacific.

<P> Besides providing retail and commercial banking services, Westpac is active
in forex and trade finance. Offshore banking is important. "We are a large lender
to businesses as well as providing other bread-and-butter products," says Westpac
manager Cliff Smith. "The only thing we don't do is foreign currency loans."

<P> ANZ, the largest bank in Vanuatu, now employs 120 staff and is active in
commercial, retail and offshore banking. The bank is also looking to strengthen
its presence in other areas. "ANZ's philosophy is to try to drill down [corner]
the retail market, and we are doing so quite successfully," says managing
director Garry Tunstall.

<P> National Bank of Vanuatu (NBV) emphasizes the provision of a more extensive
retail banking network. Since being set up by the government in December 1991 as
the only real home-grown Vanuatu bank, it has expanded dramatically. Within its
first year of operation it managed to triple its assets. Now it has 26 branches
administered almost entirely by locals. "This is not a bank with a specific
mandate, but we certainly aim to provide a banking service to the whole of
Vanuatu," says Nestor Ellinopoullos, who is an adviser to the state-owned bank.

<P> But despite considerable achievements in rural areas, the bank has not been
an unqualified success. Earlier in the year rumours surfaced that it was
experiencing financial problems. These followed the sacking of two staff members,
including the senior loans officer. The finance minister then issued a statement
confirming government support for NBV and reiterating its confidence in senior
management. The government has now agreed in principle an increase in capital
&#173; the first in NBV's history &#173; which will enable the bank to continue
expanding throughout the islands.

<P> In the longer term there is even a possibility that NBV could be merged with
the Development Bank of Vanuatu (DBV). DBV was established in 1983 soon after
independence and has fostered economic development by providing financial and
advisory services to agriculture, industry and tourism.

<P> However, shortage of funds and more difficult operating conditions have led
to major changes. Whereas DBV formerly lent almost exclusively to small-scale
Vanuatu-owned enterprises at well below market rates and with maturities of up to
15 years, it is now moving into more mainstream commercial transactions. That has
led to a major overhaul of the bank's network. As recently as 1988, DBV had seven
branches in rural areas. Now it has just two and these have since been
transformed into regional offices.

<P> A merger would create a stronger domestic institution better placed to
compete with international banks. "Maybe that <I>is</I> the way forward," says 
DBV managing director Augustine Garae. "The market is too small and we can't
compete on an even footing."

<P> A merger might be bad news for the indigenous population. Currently DBV
continues to assess the long-term viability of projects rather than simply
looking to short-term returns. It also onlends funds at 14%, a rate that is still
marginally lower than its competitors'. And while the existing commercial banks
are keen to expand their coverage, this is unlikely to include far-flung rural
areas where returns are doubtful. "They lend almost exclusively to expatriates
and to businessmen around Port-Vila," says Garae.

<H3> Tourism needs room to breathe </H3> 

<H4><B>With 84 islands, palm-fringed beaches and coral atolls, Vanuatu should be onto a winner with tourism. But there are
capacity constraints in the air and on the ground</B> </H4> 

<P> Linda Kalpoi's office in Port Vila is almost within earshot
of the Pacific breakers. This dramatic backdrop is just one reason the acting
general manager of the National Tourism Office (NTO) should have one of the
easiest jobs on earth. Vanuatu offers visitors more than 80 unspoiled islands,
palm-fringed beaches, spectacular bays and coral atolls, and one of the few live
volcanoes in the world to have easy access. "People come to Vanuatu because we
are still an unknown exotic destination," says Kalpoi. "We have sandy beaches and
coconut palms as well as adventure tours, traditional villages and one of the
world's largest intact shipwrecks."

<P> But although both Kalpoi and the government of Vanuatu have been keen to
promote these charms, their efforts have yielded only limited results. Last year
some 43,700 tourists arrived in Port Vila, compared with 42,000 in 1992. It's a
modest upward trend, but the total is still small compared with neighbouring
destinations. On average, tourists stayed 9.3 days, a marginal increase over
1992.

<P> Shortage of accommodation is one reason for the lack of crowds. Lack of
marketing and the small budget allotted to the NTO are other factors that have
impeded development of the industry. For 1996, the NTO has been awarded a budget
of Vt42 million ($30 million). That compares with Vt60 million in 1995. As a
result, the NTO employs just 12 staff and has no offices outside Vanuatu.

<P> But by far the biggest reason for slow growth is the limited number of
flights. Bauerfield Airport, Vanuatu's primary point of entry for tourists, is
relatively small and can only accommodate Boeing 737- and 727-type aircraft
without incurring runway damage.

<P> As of June 1996, the airport was served by six operators. Air Vanuatu, the
national carrier, flies to Australia six times a week and to New Zealand once a
week. Air Nauru, Air Niugini, Air Pacific, Air Caledonia and Solomon Airlines
also serve Bauerfield. Although Qantas and Air New Zealand have reciprocal
landing rights, they have so far chosen not to exercise them.

<P> "If the airport was improved, we could upgrade our planes to bring in more
passengers," says Rick Graham, manager of Iririki Island Resort and the head of
the Vanuatu Hotels Association. "That would lead new airlines to use Vanuatu as a
stopover."

<P> It's a message echoed throughout the industry and even by former government
officials. "Building a new airport should be a priority," says former finance
minister Kalpokor Kalsakau, who is now manager of the think-tank Cabinet
d'Affaires du Pacifique. "With better airport development, we would eliminate the
de facto monopoly of Air Vanuatu."

<P> Discussions have recently been held with the aim of breathing life back into
a 16-year-old proposal to build a new airport on Espiritu Santo Island. However,
donors argue that tourist traffic might not be sufficient to underwrite the costs
of an international airport, which are projected at around $25 million.

<P> "Our advice has always been that it would be unwise to raise the funds
commercially to build a new international airport," says Legesse Tickeher,
director of research at the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu. "It would be difficult to
service the loans."

<P> One option favoured by the government is to expand the existing facilities at
Bauerfield. However, mountainous terrain could make take-off technically
difficult for larger aircraft. Another option would be expansion on Espiritu
Santo Island, although currently the airport there lacks the necessary support
facilities.

<P> According to KPMG Peat Marwick, just 24,000 visitors arrive in Vanuatu every
year from Australia out of a total of 2.4 million outbound tourists, so there is
clearly room for tourist expansion. More significantly a new airport would open
up new markets and reduce dependence on Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia,
which have traditionally accounted for nearly 80% of the total.

<P> Several investors have bought land. Club Mediterrann&eacute;e has leased a
site on a small island off Efate, although it has made it clear that it will not
go ahead with development until airport facilities are improved. Another major
project is planned on Kukula Island. One businessman has plans for a casino and a
500-room hotel on Moso Island.

<P> The big projects are likely to remain on hold for the foreseeable future but
there are at least some hopeful signs. In December 1993 Le M&eacute;ridien
purchased the Radisson Royal Palms Resort and Casino in Port Vila. The hotel has
since been transformed into a four-star international resort hotel with 150
rooms. Le Lagon Park Royal, Vanuatu's largest resort, has also completed a major
refurbishment. Iririki Island Resort, which has 72 bungalows overlooking
Port-Vila harbour, is undergoing renovation.

<P> Running a hotel in the current environment is no easy task. At the Windsor
Hotel International, which largely caters to the business market, occupancy
levels are in the region of 45%, barely high enough to break even. And while
hotel owners are pinning their hopes on the airport to boost arrivals, in the
short term they see little cause for celebration. "It's an extremely tough
market," says Tony Burns, general manager at Windsor Hotel International. "There
is absolutely no assistance from the government." The high cost of food is one
problem. Sales tax and import duties have also eroded margins. "We can't even get
tax exemption on uniforms."

<P> At the luxury Iririki Island Resort, occupancy levels run on average at 85%.
Veteran hotelier Rick Graham, however, is far from ecstatic. "Business in Vanuatu
is not easy. This is a small country with only limited infrastructure. To do
well, you have to be exceptionally well run and operated."

<P> Graham says one problem is lack of government funding. Another is Air
Vanuatu's lack of capacity. "It's a Catch-22 situation," he says. "We are putting
pressure on Air Vanuatu to expand services, but they are saying if we do that,
how will we fill them?"

<P> Jean Paul Virelala, managing director of Air Vanuatu, argues for his part
that it is the hotel industry which must build the new capacity. "There have been
many times when we have been inhibited by the lack of rooms," he says. "There is
no point in Air Vanuatu putting on extra capacity in the air when there is not
sufficient capacity on the ground," he says.

<P> So far Air Vanuatu's view has prevailed. Nonetheless the airline, which last
year recorded profits of Vt206 million, is gearing up for new services. With the
opening of the Blue Water Island Resort, it plans to open a new route to Sydney
in July 1997. It may also lease a second plane from Qantas. "We already spend
more than A$1 million [US$790,000] a year promoting Vanuatu and we don't receive
any grants," says marketing manager Ted Drew. "We also encourage other airlines
to make use of the airport."

<P> A draft of the tourist development masterplan published in 1994 suggests the
government is pinning its hopes on big increases in hotel rooms and visitors.
Using a medium-growth projection, it expects tourist numbers to reach 63,000 in
the year 2000, rising to 85,000 by 2004. A high-growth projection suggests the
figure could be as high as 126,000. Both look over-ambitious for the time being.

<H4><b> Convenience with competence </b></H4>
<P> Vanuatu's maritime centre is situated on a gently curving bay a short
distance from Port-Vila. On a typical day, one large cargo vessel will be moored
at the quayside together with a handful of yachts and pleasure boats. But the
small number of big vessels in port is misleading. Vanuatu now has 423 vessels on
its shipping register with a total displacement of  2.8 million gross tons. What
is more, it is increasingly recognized as one of the most respectable of
international open registries, with a central office in New York and 260
inspectors based around the world.

<P> "Vanuatu is at the top end of the open-registry market," says Thomas Bayer,
chairman of Vanuatu Maritime Services, which has the sole concession from the
government to operate the registry. "We are extremely proud of the reputation we
have acquired."

<P> The good name is built on the rigorous safety requirements imposed on vessels
sailing under the Vanuatu flag, and a record of proper manning and effective
inspection. Vanuatu is a member of the International Maritime Organization (IMO)
and has acceded to all its major conventions. Furthermore its Maritime Act is
based on US maritime law.

<P> Boats that register in Vanuatu are required to undergo examination based on
the requirements of the US coastguards. In accordance with generally-accepted
practice, they cannot normally be registered if they are more than 20 years of
age.

<P> The relatively stringent features of Vanuatu's shipping registry have meant
higher costs than in some jurisdictions. But they have not led to a slow-down in
the number of applications. Despite costs that are almost triple those of Panama,
Vanuatu continues to record strong growth. Says Bayer: "If you want to drive
around in a BMW, it costs you more, but you get less problems. That is what we
are saying about Vanuatu."

<P> Vanuatu offers additional advantages to shipping businesses. Through its
offshore financial centre, it can provide company registration for shipowners or
operators, ship management companies and, in some cases, even ship financing. "We
can provide a complete package," says Bayer. "And that is a major incentive for
our clients."
