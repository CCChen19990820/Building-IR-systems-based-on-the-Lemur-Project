</ul>

<p>JAMES THURBER left his own monument. He created it between 1927 and 1947 in the pages of the <i>New Yorker</i>. Anyone attempting to build another is inevitably reduced to the status of the Late Arrival or the Also Ran (alongside such other small burrowing Thurber creatures as the Hopeless Quandary and the White Lie). Thurber understood Thurber as nobody else did, and wrote about himself with reckless transparency. His readers did not doubt that the Thurber male, endlessly hen-pecked, baffled by modern machinery, finding fierce courage only in liquor, was Thurber himself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He was born in 1894, "on a night of wild portent and high wind", in Columbus, Ohio. His fate was sealed seven years later, when his brother half-blinded him with a toy bow and arrow. Like a near-contemporary, James Joyce, Thurber found escape from his trauma by becoming a bookish child, immersed in fantasies and word games; in middle age, tall and angular and with glasses "as thick as binoculars", he also came to resemble Joyce physically. By 1953, almost totally blind, he delighted in having parts of "Finnegans Wake" read out to him by his secretary.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For most of his career, however, near-blindness gave Thurber his comic inspiration. At parties, he knocked over fruit bowls and lampshades; in hotels, he wandered into wrong rooms; when writing, he would dip his pen into his scotch. Behind the driving wheel, "flecks of dust and streaks of bug blood on the windshield look to me often like old admirals in uniform, or crippled apple women, or the front ends of barges and I whirl out of their way, thus going into ditches and fields and up on front lawns, endangering the life of authentic admirals and apple women who may be out on the roads for a breath of air before retiring." Undoing a woman's girdle "is likely to lead to a grave and determined effort, in which the gentleman goes about the process much as if he were trying to fix a gasoline engine." Out of this murky and fumbling world came "Villanelle of Horatio Street, Manhattan", his first published piece for the <i>New Yorker</i>, which concluded:
<ul><font size=-1>If your eyes lift up to greet<br>The stars you fall on, sure as hell,<br>Rusted bed-springs in the street,<br>All in a clutter at your feet.</font></ul>
His handicap had another outcome, too. According to his biographer (who does an exhaustive and fairly convincing job of proving it), Thurber developed a savage dislike of the weaker side of himself, all that seemed to him feminine and dependent; and this led on to savagery against "the weaker sex" in general. His drawings seem to make the point. The women in Thurber's cartoons are either daisy-plucking airheads or emasculating harridans, giants before whom the timid Thurber male cowers and flees away. Only his loyal and equally nonplussed dog offers him comfort against them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thurber's series of articles, "The War Between Men and Women", drew heavily on his miserable first marriage, in which much of his time was spent in enforced separation in the Algonquin Hotel surrounded by unlaundered shirts. But it continued even during his happy second marriage to a woman who understood, encouraged and humoured him. He once explained that what made the male fear the female was "the look one woman gives another when observing what she is wearing." This fear apparently never left him, just as he never lost his terrifying irascibility when drunk, or his contrition the morning after.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thurber was not a political animal. Indeed, the early <i>New Yorker</i> was determinedly frivolous, its staff--on the evidence of these pages--spending most of their time half-legless in speakeasies. In 1933, his blithe advice for dealing with what he called "The Inflation" began: "Don't shout over the phone." In 1936, during the terrible dust storms, he joked to a friend "My God, this nation is rapidly being covered by sand!" Only the rise of fascism and later McCarthyism kindled a political conscience in him. In 1950, in an essay entitled "Look Out for the Thing", he tackled anti-communist hysteria head on:
<ul><font size=-1>The Thing can blacken a man at a distance of 10,000 miles, by using one or another of its many stings: the thundering charge, the sweeping generalisation, the bold assumption, the mysterious record, the secret testimony, the overheard insinuation, the patriotic gesture, the enormous lie, the fearful warning ... Do not attempt to take the Thing single-handed. It is armed and dangerous, what is worse, it has a lot of friends.</font></ul>
Thurber also has a lot of friends: people who have warmed over time to the cuddly man in a derby, writhing in an armchair, whom they have taken him to be. This book, sadly, will not win him any more.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Harrison Kinney plainly dotes on his subject, but his doting proves fatal. For all his diligence and hard work, he does not understand that Thurber's stories are ruined by paraphrasing, as a fine tune by a crass arrangement. Nor does he understand that much of his analysis is, in the end, irrelevant. Dealing with the famous brawl in "The Dog that Bit People", in which the dog's owner ends up on the table among the silverware while the dog sails across the room, Mr Kinney brings in Thurber's brother to say exactly who bit whom first, and whether the dog would have bitten anyone at all, or "maybe just snarled and snapped". At such times the reader would like to bury his teeth deep into Mr Kinney's leg, and worry him to death.

</p><p><p>ROD</p>
</p><p>DILAS: Gospodine i prijatelju Zulfikarpasicu! Nisam novinar - ne intervjuisem. Mada sam se pre mnogo godina bavio politikom - nisam politicki aktivan. Ali, buduci da se Vi jos uvek aktivno bavite politikom, necemo moci izbeci politicke teme, pogotovo ne savremene - u tome ce nam pomoci gospoda Gace, koja je i bolje informisana.
</p><p>Vi mene u prvom redu interesujete i privlacite kao pisca. Vasi politicki pogledi su mi poznati uopsteno. Ali Vi ste za mene licnost koja u sebi sadrzi i izrazava, izrazitije nego bilo ko koga znam, nekoliko epoha Bosne. Moja je namera i zelja da Vas podstaknem, pitanjima, da se iskazete kao licnost: to ima siri znacaj i trajnu vrednost, jer Vi ste, verovatno, poslednja licnost koja u sebi spaja najznacajnija vremena Bosne, a ja, mozda, jedini pisac koji nastoji i da to iskazete - a Vi to mozete i umete.
</p><p>Napominjem da istoriju Bosne poznajem malo, uopsteno - onu islamsku Bosnu jos manje, pa o tome nema smisla ni da govorimo. No to ne bi trebalo da nam smeta, buduci da moj prilaz Vama nije istoricarski, nego, kao sto sam rekao: knjizevni.
</p><p>Uostalom, Vas rod je istorija, izrazi istorije - ako ne svih Bosanaca, svakako njihovog znatnog dela.
</p><p>Pa, da pocnemo od Vaseg roda, odnosno, kako bi Bosnjaci rekli - od odzaka.
</p><p>Iz ranijih razgovora sa Vama, znam da ste Vi iz sireg bratstva Cengica. To je jedna od najpoznatijih aristokratskih porodica u Bosni, koja je igrala prilicnu u]ogu i u crnogorskoj istoriji i veoma je prisutna u epskoj srpskoj narodnoj poeziji. Nije lako biti prisutan u pesmama, makar to bilo i kod protivnika, u protivnickim pesmama. I to treba zasluziti. A nije lako biti ni od znamenitog roda: podsticaj i nadahnuce, a]i i teska obaveza i brizna savest. Otkad ste vi Zulfikarpasic i zasto ste napustili prezime Cengic?
</p><p>ZULFIKARPASIC: Familija Cengica grana se na vise dijelova. Od moga neposrednog predka Zulfikar-pase poticu Zulfikarpasici, focanski Alajbegovici i focanski Pasici, koji su izumrli. Zulfikar-pasa Cengic, ded moga oca bio je zvornicki sandzak-beg, poznati junak i pasa. Jedno je vrijeme bio i u Srbiji, u Valjevu, a onda u Zvorniku i-Foci. Vodio je vojsku i pacificirao Drobnjake, kada su drobljanski uskoci u mirno doba napadali na Bosnu, uzimali stoku i ubijali stanovnistvo. Onda je Zulfikarpasa Cengic, zvani Miljevina - po kuli i mjestu gdje je stanovao krenuo u proljece 1812 s vojskom od Foce preko Crkvica i Jezera na Komarnicu. Smail-aga udari s drugom vojskom Bosnjaka od Gacka preko Pive na Dubrovsko. Ova godina prozvana je "Miljevina" i "o njoj se i sad s uzasom govori u Drobnjaku", kaze Andrija Luburic' u svom djelu "Drobnjaci", objavljenom 1930 u Beogradu. Taj dogadaj i to veliko junastvo Drobnjaka i Zulfikarpase, kaze Luburic, opjevali su i muslimani i pravoslavni. Ocuvana je do Drugog svjetskog rata i Zulfikarpasina korespodencija s knezom Milosem2 i vladikom Petrom II Petrovicem3. Po Zulfikarpasi Cengicu njegovi su potomci dobili prezime Zulfikarpasic-Cengic. Moj otac se potpisivao s oba prezimena. Jos svjedodzba iz moje osnovne skole ima obadva prezimena. S vremenom, jos u mojoj mladosti, ovo smo Cengic izostavili. <br>

</p><p><p>Punishment in Europe: Perceptions and Commonalities</p>
</p><p>Joe Sim, Vincenzo Ruggiero and Mick Ryan
</p><ul><font size=-1>The New Penology ... is concerned with techniques for <br> identifying, classifying and managing groups assorted <br> by levels of dangerousness. It takes crime for granted. <br> It accepts deviance as normal. It is sceptical that liberal <br> interventionist crime control strategies do or can make <br> a difference. Thus its aim is not to intervene in individuals' <br> lives for the purpose of ascertaining responsibility, making <br> the guilty 'pay for their crime' or changing them. Rather it <br> seeks to regulate groups as part of a strategy of managing <br> danger. (Feeley and Simon 1994:173)</font></ul>
<p><ul><font size=-1>Of course we must make it easier for our people to travel <br> throughout the Community. But it is a matter of plain common <br> sense that we cannot totally abolish frontier controls if we <br> are also to protect our citizens from crime and stop the <br> movement of drugs, of terrorists and of illegal immigrants. <br> (Margaret Thatcher 1988, cited in Gordon 1989:8)</font></ul>
<p>In October 1993, there were 300,000 individuals confined in the prisons of the twelve member states of the European Union (EU). Eighty-five per cent of these individuals received no work or training during their detention. In four states - France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom - the prison population was over 50,000. These bare figures, published by the European Employment Group (Guardian 18 October 1993), are part of a much larger package of statistics and studies which have appeared since the mid 1980S comparing different aspects of imprisonment in Europe. The biannual statistical bulletins published by the Council of Europe, various United Nations surveys and a range of sociological work have raised a number of important theoretical and empirical questions about the place of the prison within nation states and the differences between prison systems in terms of structure, organization, regimes and populations. The profound economics political and cultural developments which have taken place in Western and Eastern Europe since the late 1980s have only added to the significance of the questions asked within the literature, particularly in respect of the complex relationship between crime, punishment, social change and the maintenance of order. (See, for example, Downes 1988; Cain 1989; Whitfield 1991; Pease and Hukkila 1990; Muncie and Sparks 1991; Heidensohn and Farrell 1991; Smit and Dunkel 1991; Hudson 1993; Young and Brown 1993; Vagg 1994; Thomas and Moerings 1994; Tomasevski 1992; 1994; Pease 1994; Powell 1994; South and Weiss forthcoming).
</p><p>However, despite the insights developed within this burgeoning literature there are still a number of gaps which remain to be filled. This collection of essays seeks to fill some of them by providing one of the first detailed studies of a range of Western European penal systems. The word 'penal' is important here for we have sought to ensure that contributors have focused on, and analysed, not only prison systems in their respective countries but also the various alternatives to custody which are available and the place of these alternatives in the business and distribution of punishment. The collection, therefore, provides a critical anatomy and empirical overview of the full range of penal sanctions utilized in each country and analyses how these sanctions are organized. Contributors have been asked to pinpoint the nature of the penal population in relation to sentence disposition, their class, gender and racial composition and the nature of the offences for which individuals have been confined. This last issue is particularly apposite when set against the (non) policing and (non) punishment of the crimes committed by the powerful in Western Europe (both economic and otherwise), a point we shall return to below.
</p><p>Finally, we have also asked contributors to critically evaluate trends in the philosophy, practices and politics of punishment and to locate these trends within the broader processes of social change taking place within nation-states. Individual authors have identified a number of significant trends, many of which began in the mid 1970s, intensified in the 1980s and became institutionalized in the 1990s. In particular, the intensification and interpenetration of disciplinary discourses within the state and civil society, the drive towards authoritarian law and order solutions for social problems and the rolling back of national and international welfare states are key themes identified in this volume. <br>

</p><p>This unique and original text offers undergraduates and interested professionals a much-needed description of how the penal system, including both prisons and alternatives to custody, is organized in eight major Western European countries.
</p><p>Each chapter provides readers with a critical anatomy and empirical overview of the full range of penal sanctions used in each country and an analysis of how these sanctions are implemented. Using statistical data which are often not yet widely available, contributors examine the nature of the penal population in relation to sentencing, to its class, gender and racial composition, and top the nature of the offences for which individuals have been confined.
</p><p>While highlighting several common trends in penal policy and strategy across Europe, and seeking to assess to what extent these commonalities are begin generated by the wider process of political integration, Western European Penal Systems also demonstrated that each of the eight countries has to an important extent its own culture of punishment which is constantly being reinterpreted and reworked.
</p><p>Reaffirming a commitment to a critical academic tradition which goes beyond the generally accepted definitions of crime and deviance, this clear and integrated text will provide readers with an invaluable introduction to Western European penal systems. <br>

<p>EVERY new society, wrote Nathaniel Hawthorne in one of his cheerier moods, is soon in need of a graveyard and a prison. The glum tale of western punishment, as told in the excellent "Oxford History of Prisons", a set of essays by social historians and penal experts, would seem to bear him out: prisons are wasteful, unjust--and indispensable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Penal reform and counter-reform have followed each other through recent times in a melancholy cycle. Enlightenment reformers devised the modern prison and swifter execution as humane alternatives to branding, maiming or brutally prolonged death. Anyone wanting a refresher course in ancient and medieval pain-infliction can get it from this illustrated volume. It includes the Roman <i>culleus</i> (a drowning sack for kin murderers filled also with monkey, dog and snake) and ingenious later torments. Though the book will do nicely as a coffee-table Chamber of Horrors, it is serious history with a clear, pertinent thread.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jails were once just for civil debtors, for those sent to trial and for felons awaiting execution. From the 18th century semi-solitary confinement replaced the whip, the wheel and the pillory as the public theatre of bodily pain gave way to a shut-away world of internal banishment. That new world did not look like progress for long. By early this century prison itself--not to mention execution of any kind--had come to seem barbarous. Efforts were made to lighten sentences, to limit or end the death penalty, to empty jails and generally to lessen the cruelty of the criminal-justice system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, as if by Hawthorne's law, penal fashion in America and much of Europe has swung hard the other way. Norval Morris, an eloquent advocate of alternatives to prison, ends the "Oxford History of Prisons" with a particularly depressing essay on contemporary America, where the number of prisoners has more than doubled since 1980. It is now over 1m and disproportionately many are black. All but 13 states have brought back the death penalty since 1976, when the Supreme Court, after a four-year suspension, deemed it constitutional again. Prisoners on death row are being gassed, poisoned, electrocuted or shot at a rate of 30-40 a year. In Alabama, chain gangs are back.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No nation in Europe now punishes on this scale or with such ferocity. The gallows, the firing squad and the guillotine have disappeared, as have the penal colony and the stone quarry. Yet, under pressure from lawmakers and prosecutors, who seem to believe that this is what the public wants, European courts have been passing longer sentences, with less easy parole. German judges, who doggedly question the point of long sentences, are an exception. Italy's authorities are trying to reduce the country's inmate population but more than anything because there is no room left in its prisons--or public money for new ones.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This harsher European climate is looked into in "Western European Penal Systems", a dry though useful set of nine country studies. Its editors could have been less timid about spotting common trends. They themselves say that national patterns of criminal justice are blending as travel increases and economies mesh. They point to the high number of foreigners (many of them illegal immigrants) in Europe's jails--perhaps 25% of France's 52,000 prisoners. History recurs. As the Oxford prison history notes, Europe has always put away immigrants and people with the wrong colour or beliefs more readily than others.</p>
<p><b>Neither fair, effective nor affordable?</b><br>The crime rate is a poorly understood and sensitive variable. Readers of these books are wisely and repeatedly warned that it can go down as well as up. In the 1980s America's crime rate first fell and then rose. It now seems to be falling again, but the prison population rises inexorably. Attempts in Europe to show a link between harsh penalties and less crime (or vice versa) have also faltered. The prison population went up in post-war England and Wales, down in the post-war Netherlands, while crime rose in both places. Nor, if prisons are failing at their job, are they failing cheaply. America is spending $25 billion a year on them and many European countries are investing expensively in new ones.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But what is prison's job? A generation ago most people would probably have said it was to deter or prevent crime and to rehabilitate criminals. Nowadays a likelier reply is that it gives the wicked their deserts. Is it sensible to expect prison to do all that? Can punishment be effective for society as well as fair to villains and victims?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A Reader on Punishment" edited by Antony Duff, a philosopher, and David Garland, a criminologist, is a collection of 14 recent essays or book-chapters on the whys, whos and hows of punishment that it would be hard to better. Its scope is both philosophical and practical, English and American. It questions the fashionable "futility thesis" that neither prison nor penal reform work. Interesting alternatives to prison--supervision (perhaps electronically monitored), community service, heavy fines--are seriously and intelligently canvassed. Its bolder contributors ask why the criminal law or the state's monopoly on criminal justice should be kept at all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Historically, the criminal law emerged as central authorities took over the exaction of compensation and infliction of punishment from church courts, feuding clans and vigilante posses. Herman Bianchi's contribution explores replacing criminal penalties with debt liability, leaving prison as a "sanctuary" for perpetrators of heinous deeds. You could go further. It is possible to imagine a system without state-controlled criminal justice in which people could buy the private security and victim insurance they wanted. The rich or educated, naturally, would buy more cover than the poor as their property and their persons (valued by life earning-power) are worth more, though it is doubtful many would find that "just" in any normal sense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A virtue of the Duff-Garland collection is to take zero-based approaches to punishment seriously. Forget for a moment the expensive misery of today's prisons. How can any state-inflicted pain be justified? There are two standard answers. Abstract as they sound, understanding them helps keep more practical issues straight.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The utilitarian answer judges punishment by its consequences: does it help or harm general well-being? Punishment's minus--pain to criminals--must be outweighed by its pluses: deterring or preventing crime, turning crooks into non-crooks. As with most "consequentialist" attempts to mark out right from wrong, trouble comes when punishment stops delivering good consequences (as many believe it has done): safer streets, less car theft, fewer repeaters, cheaper law enforcement. Is punishment still justified? Some robust utilitarians say it is not. Instead of vainly trying to police unneeded laws, they propose a sweeping decriminalisation of sanctioned conduct, starting with drugs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if useless practically, punishment may be needed for principle's sake. Punishment, argues the "just deserts" or "retributivist" school, is what criminals deserve, victims merit and society has to inflict if it is not to condone wrongdoing. A big change over the past 20 years, Messrs Duff and Garland note, is how far "consequentialism has been abandoned and retributivist ideas revived". This is not a fight with knock-outs. Utilitarians and retributivists have been at each other for centuries and are not likely to stop now. Ringside theorists can get more in "Punishment", a set of strictly philosophical essays.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In line with "just-deserts" theory have come mandatory sentences, strict sentencing guidelines and less elastic parole. "Same-for-all" sentencing sounds good in theory. Tough-on-crime politicians love it. But no system lives up to it. "Punishment" ends with a lively exchange about sentencing bias in capital punishment. If death is a just desert for brutal murders can it be just to execute only a few of the brutal murderers? This is an extreme example of a broader point. Fair punishment depends not just on its severity but on how it is shared out. You need not be a Marxist to ask why, in practice, rich or educated criminals are at less risk of jail than poor or ignorant ones. A hard-nosed answer, heard on left and right and found at places in these books, is that real-world law enforcement is as much to do with "rabble control", to put it savagely, as with justice or fairness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another live issue involving fairness is "due process", from arrest to trial. Some, like Harold Rothwax, a New York state criminal judge feared for his quick lip and stiff sentencing, think it has become a crook's charter. He attacks the build-up of defendants' rights in America since the 1960s. His bugbears, familiar to watchers of American court dramas, include the exclusion of wrongly obtained evidence, the Miranda warning to suspects, the speedy-trial right, the defence's one-sided access to prosecution evidence and the rule that silence from the accused is not incriminating (a rule relaxed, controversially, in England and Wales). Judge Rothwax would roll all that back, though his actual proposals, some of them sensible, amount to less of a counter-revolution than that sounds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In the Name of the Law" is a stimulating polemic from the other side of the Atlantic (and of the political divide) by David Rose of the <i>Observer</i> newspaper. English criminal justice, he argues, cannot avoid grotesque miscarriages such as the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven. His prime suspect, plausibly, is not the police (better trained and less corrupt than in the past) but bad prosecutors. More speculatively, he favours a more inquisitorial system of justice on continental European lines.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After reading these books, a betting person would still have to expect nastier, more crowded prisons for the time being. Set against the weary, aggrieved public mood about law and order in America and Europe, these books have a theoretical flavour. The final two apart, none can be recommended to speech-writers for candidates to high office. Still, they are full of provocative questions and vigorous argument: just right for stirring up sharper debate.

</p><p><p>Introduction: Thinking about Punishment</p>
</p><p>R. A. DUFF and D. GARLAND
</p><p>1. Philosophical and Sociological Perspectives on Punishment
</p><p>This volume brings together writings on the philosophy of punishment, penology, and the sociology of punishment. All too often these different ways of writing about punishment are treated as if they are separate disciplines which can proceed independently of one another. The result is that philosophical discussions are often far removed from the realities of penal practice, while penology and the sociology of punishment are frequently crude or evasive in their handling of complex normative issues.
</p><p>Our collection aims to show the value of establishing a dialogue between these closely related endeavours. We have made no attempt to survey the whole range of penal topics. Instead, we have focused on some central themes in penal jurisprudence--concerning the proper aims and justification of the practice of state punishment--and tried to show that these issues can be adequately considered only when normative and empirical issues are combined. Serious thought about punishment must focus on 'working social categories' (HIRST: 267)1 and institutional practices, rather than on merely abstract ideas or disembodied theories: but that focus must be informed by an adequate understanding of normative theories. .
</p><p>Philosophies of punishment must therefore be assessed not merely as they appear on the page, but as they are (or could practicably be) realized in specific practices. Pragmatic penology must be subjected to close moral and political scrutiny as well as to rigorous empirical testing. And sociologists of punishment must remember that what they are trying to describe, analyse, and explain is itself a normative practice which must be understood accordingly. State punishment is a practice that claims to be structured by certain definite aims and values. Its officials justify the institution, and their activities within it, by reference to those legitimating aims and values, and often draw on normative philosophical theories of punishment to do so. Philosophy thus enters directly into this practical context, though rarely in a very coherent or elaborated way, and any sociology which disregards this normative dimension, or treats it as mere rhetoric, is liable to misunderstand the nature of the institution. No doubt there is usually some discrepancy between the declared aims of a practice and its actual operations; no doubt there are often latent objectives which officials are reluctant to articulate. But any adequate analysis of penal practice will still need to understand the normative rationales which structure official conduct; and any serious critique will have to articulate and defend normative arguments of its own.
</p><p>The division of academic labour might try to set them apart, but philosophers and sociologists need each other if they are to make sense of the world. And anyone with a practical interest in penal matters-- whether as policy-maker or as practitioner; as someone subject to penal measures, or as a member of the public in whose name state punishments are imposed--will need to draw upon a whole range of relevant materials, rather than on just one particular specialism. In this Introduction, and in the brief remarks which precede each of the collected essays, we offer a philosophical and sociological framework which should enable readers to relate the essays to each other, and to the intellectual and practical contexts from which they emerge. <br>

</p><p><p>JEFFRIE G. MURPHY 	Marxism and Retribution</p>
</p><ul><font size=-1>Punishment in general has been defended as a means either <br> of ameliorating or of intimidating. Now what right have you <br> to punish me for the amelioration or intimidation of others? <br> And besides there is history--there is such a thing as statistics <br> --which prove with the most complete evidence that since <br> Cain the world has been neither intimidated nor ameliorated <br> by punishment. Quite the contrary. From the point of view of <br> abstract right, there is only one theory of punishment which <br> recognizes human dignity in the abstract, and that is the theory <br> of Kant, especially in the more rigid formula given to it by Hegel. <br> Hegel says: "Punishment is the right of the criminal. It is an act <br> of his own will. The violation of right has been proclaimed by <br> the criminal as his own right. His crime is the negation of right. <br> Punishment is the negation of this negation, and consequently an <br> affirmation of right, solicited and forced upon the criminal by himself."</font></ul>
<ul><font size=-1>There is no doubt something specious in this formula, inasmuch as <br> Hegel, instead of looking upon the criminal as the mere object, the <br> slave of justice, elevates him to the position of a free and self- <br> determined being. Looking, however, more closely into the matter, <br> we discover that German idealism here, as in most other instances, <br> has but given a transcendental sanction to the rules of existing society. <br> Is it not a delusion to substitute for the individual with his real <br> motives, with multifarious social circumstances pressing upon him, <br> the abstraction of "free will"--one among the many qualities of man <br> for man himself? . . . Is there not a necessity for deeply reflecting <br> upon an alteration of the system that breeds these crimes, instead of <br> glorifying the hangman who executes a lot of criminals to make room <br> only for the supply of new ones?</font></ul>
<p><ul><font size=-1>Karl Marx, "Capital Punishment," <br> New York Daily Tribune, 18 February 1853</font></ul>
<p>Philosophers have written at great length about the moral problems involved in punishing the innocent--particularly as these problems raise obstacles to an acceptance of the moral theory of Utilitarianism. Punishment of an innocent man in order to bring about good social consequences is, at the very least, not always clearly wrong on utilitarian principles. This being so, utilitarian principles are then to be condemned by any morality that may be called Kantian in character. For punishing an innocent man, in Kantian language, involves using that man as a mere means or instrument to some social good and is thus not to treat him as an end in himself, in accord with his dignity or worth as a person. <br>

<p>On Christmas Eve 1968, ten-year-old Pamela Powers was attending an event with her family at the Des Moines, Iowa, YMCA. She excused herself to go to the bathroom and never came back.
</p><p>About half an hour after Pamela left her family, several people saw a man leave the YMCA building carrying a blanket wrapped bundle, which he placed on the front seat of his car. A boy who helped him open the door (his hands were full) told police he "saw two legs in it and they were skinny and white." The police suspected that the bundle contained Pamela's body, but the suspect was already gone, heading across Iowa on Interstate 80. Police later found his car abandoned in Davenport, 160 miles away, containing heartbreaking evidence-- the blanket and some of Pamela's clothing.
</p><p>Two days later, a man named Robert Williams telephoned Henry McKnight, a Des Moines lawyer, because he knew the police were looking for him. On McKnight's advice he surrendered to the Davenport police. A judge ordered that he be transported back to Des Moines.
</p><p>Des Moines police captain Leaming and another officer drove to Davenport to collect Williams, with a warning from McKnight: "Don't talk to him. Don't question him. He's represented by counsel now; he's been arraigned; so you mustn't talk to him." The officers nodded. They knew the law full well. Once a defendant had been arraigned and was represented, the police couldn't question him outside the presence of his attorney.
</p><p>They started off on the 160-mile journey to Des Moines. As they drove, it began to snow, and midway through the trip, the snow was coming down very hard and piling up along the road.
</p><p>Captain Leaming was aware he could not question Williams, but he also knew that Williams was a fragile man of conscience--an escaped mental patient with strong religious tendencies. Very casually, Leaming turned to Williams and said, "Reverend Williams, you know I'm not supposed to question you and I'm not going to question you. But I have something I want to mention. It's a concern of mine. <br>

</p><p>Why we punish, who we punish, and how we punish are central elements of any discussion of the role of law in modern society.
</p><p>In this impressive collection, two leading experts on the theory of punishment have selected a range of articles which have made important and influential contributions  to the way in which punishment is understood in contemporary society. The collection is prefaced by an original introduction setting out the issues to be discussed.
</p><p>Throughout the book the aim of the editors is to demonstrate that normative and empirical questions about punishment are deeply interrelated, and to show the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to understanding this vital social institution. <br>

</p><p>"The essays make original contributions to the debate, which is not easy on a subject that has received as much attention as punishment has in philosophical and ethical literature over a considerable period of time. The authors of the collected papers are among the leading philosophers working in ethics and political philosophy generally, and a number are leading contributors to this debate in particular." <br> --Dan W. Brock, Director, Center of Biomedical Ethics, Brown University
</p><p>The problem of justifying legal punishment has been at the heart of legal and social philosophy from the very earliest recorded philosophical texts. However, despite several hundred years of debate, philosophers have not reached agreement about how legal punishment can be morally justified. That is the central issue addressed by the contributors to this volume. All of the essays collected here have ben published in the highly respected journal Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs. Taken together, they offer not only significant proposals for improving established theories of punishment and compelling arguments against long-held positions, but also original and important answers to the question, "How is punishment to be justified?"
</p><p>Part I of this collection, "Justifications of Punishment," examines how any practice of punishment can be morally justified. Contributors include Jeffrie G. Murphy, Alan H. Goldman, Warren Quinn, C.S. Nino, and Jean Hampton. The papers in Part II, "Problems of Punishment," address more specific issues arising in established theories. The authors are Martha C. Nussbaum, Michael Davis, and A. John Simmons. In the final section, "Capital Punishment," contributors discuss the justifiability of capital punishment, one of the most debated philosophical topics of this century. Essayists include David A. Conway, Jeffrey H. Reiman, Stephen Nathanson, and Ernest van den Haag. <br>

</p><p>Brace yourselves for the rush of anger as Guilty throws open the dark curtain that has shielded the criminal justice system from public scrutiny. Why should technicalities allow convicted murderers and rapists to walk free? What really went wrong in the O. J. Simpson trial? In story after story, Guilty lays bare a system where truth is treated like an outmoded relic. This is a remarkable book. written compellingly by a judge who has devoted his life to a system that, he now realizes, often serves the cause of injustice. If you are concerned about criminal justice in America, you should read Guilty." --PHILIP HOWARD, author of The Death of Common Sense
</p><p>Judge Harold J. Rothwax is renowned in legal circles for his sharp mind, candor, and tough rulings. (Quivering lawyers refer to him as "the Prince of Darkness.") Now Rothwax has written a brilliant and controversial book that puts our criminal justice system on trial. His verdict, after twenly-five years as a judge and after close scrutiny of the O. J. Simpson trial: Guilty.
</p><p>Rothwax takes us inside his courtroom and tells talles of justice gone awry that only a seasoned judge could disclose. We are in his chambers as he does battle with lawyers more interested in their personal ambitions than justice. We are at a judicial conference where Rothwax stumps fifty appeals court judges, who admit they don't understand the Supreme Court's latest search-and-seizure rulings. We are in the courtroom, where Rothwax must sit patiently and allow lawyers to willfully obfuscate the truth.
</p><p>According to Rothwax, America is fast becoming a nation of bad laws, in which criminals and defense attorneys hide behind a morass of poorly conceived statutes, procedures, and rulings that prevent courts from resolving the paramount question at hand: Did the accused commit the crime? In trial after maddening trial, Rothwax sees the truth sacrificed at the altar of an increasingly arcane process designed to protect the rights of criminals.
</p><p>Drawing on a career's worth of experiences and using the Simpson trial as an example, Rothwax makes his case for ten major reforms of the criminal justice system, including the end of unanimous jury verdicts, the elimination of Miranda rulings, and a new interpretation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. For example, Rothwax believes that defendants (like O. J. Simpson) should tell their story and that judges should allow juries to draw adverse inferences if they don't.
</p><p>Judge Rothwax's stories will provoke outrage. His ideas will challenge assumptions about law and society. At a time when truth and justice have become estranged, Guilty demands to be read. <br>

<p>BOOKS and television documentaries seeking to explain the violent break-up of Yugoslavia are legion. But they are mostly by onlookers. Books by participants have a special value, hard as it is for ex-Yugoslavs to come to terms with their terrible recent war.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among Serb writers the big issue is who "lost" Yugoslavia. Borisav Jovic wrote an absorbing diary covering 1989-92. Though not a principal, he was an important supporting player. In the critical 12 months after May 1990, he was president of Yugoslavia's eight-member federal presidency. On May 15th 1991 he chaired, in effect, its last meaningful session. On the agenda was the choice of his successor. It was Croatia's turn in the chair and normally the 12-month job would have passed to the Croat member, Stipe Mesic. But the Serbian republic and its allies contrived to block his appointment, which provoked a constitutional crisis and opened the way to civil war.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Jovic was never the equal of Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, but he had a voice that counted on the little-known though influential Council for the Protection of the Constitutional Order. His insider's diary suggests that Serbian policy in those critical early months was more fluid and less under Mr Milosevic's control than was generally supposed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Jovic claims to have tried (and failed) to prod into action General Veljko Kadijevic, who was defence minister from 1988 to 1992. In March 1991 he even resigned as head of the presidency, which under Yugoslavia's constitution commanded the armed forces. His aim, he says, was to create a vacuum into which the generals might step by staging coups against the democratically-elected governments of Croatia and Slovenia. But, on Mr Jovic's account, Mr Kadijevic and the senior generals hesitated, fearful as they were of armed resistance in those republics and anxious about the West's reaction to the use of force, so missing the best moment for decisive action.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In his own book, which came out before Mr Jovic's, General Kadijevic anticipates and defends himself against any charge of "losing" Yugoslavia. He blames, rather, the shortsightedness and irresponsible jockeying of Yugoslavia's politicians, the high number of desertions among Serb conscripts and the rapacious insubordination of Serb paramilitary bands sent in to cause trouble or worse in Bosnia and Croatia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;General Kadijevic, a true Tito man, mistrusted and despised Mr Jovic's raw Serb chauvinism. Like him, however, he has an animus towards the Slovenes, and especially to <i>Mladina</i>, a satirical Slovenian news magazine, which he accuses of going out of its way to humiliate the Yugoslav armed forces as far back as the mid-1980s. His other fixed idea, surprising perhaps in someone who knows West Point so well, is that western powers plotted the break-up of Yugoslavia--when the West strove too long or not effectively enough to keep it together.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Croatia, by contrast, arguments tend to take the malign intent of Serbia, or of its nationalists, for granted and to concentrate instead on the tactics of Croatia's president, Franjo Tudjman. Mr Mesic has written a vivid account of the events of 1991 as seen from the Croat side. But for outright criticism of Mr Tudjman, Zdravko Tomac's is the book. He was a top Croatian Communist who lost to Franjo Tudjman's party in the 1990 election, then joined Mr Tudjman's war-time coalition as vice-premier in 1991, only to fall out with his boss over Bosnia, outraged as he was by Mr Tudjman's eagerness to carve it up with Serbia. In the second volume of his well-documented book, appropriately sub-titled "Who killed Bosnia?", he judges Mr Tudjman's policy in Bosnia a disaster, not least for Croatia, and the main cause of the war between Croats and Muslims in Bosnia, which nearly left the Serbs there outright victors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Croatia and Slovenia seceded, poorly armed Bosnians had a miserable choice: live with nationalist Serbia or fight. Could the Bosnian government have avoided war, with its attendant massacres and flights of people, by accommodating the Serbs? Milovan Djilas discussed this question in Budapest shortly before his death in 1995 with Adil Zulfikarpasic, a businessman and philanthropist who lives in Zurich.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Djilas, a Montenegrin, was one of the great figures in post-war Yugoslavia. During the second world war he fought as a partisan with Tito, Yugoslavia's long-time leader, who had him jailed for dissent in the 1950s. In the late 1980s, when Serb nationalism replaced communist orthodoxy in Belgrade, Djilas derided that too. Mr Zulfikarpasic, who comes from an old Bosnian Muslim family, was also a partisan, but no Communist. Having made a fortune abroad, he returned to Bosnia in 1990 to promote a non-confessional liberalism. Few listened. Bosnia's voters split on sectional lines--Muslim, Serb and Croat. Disappointed, he left again to build up an institute of Bosnian learning and culture in Zurich.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Zulfikarpasic did try to reach a peaceful accommodation for Bosnia with Mr Milosevic. Significantly, he believes that it might have succeeded but for the wrecking tactics of Bosnia's Muslim president, Alija Izetbegovic. Mr Zulfikarpasic also had a wide-ranging and often scintillating debate, published now as a book, with three members of the opposition in Croatia: Ivo Banac, a Yale historian, Vlado Gotovac, an ex-dissident, poet and leader of Croatia's Social-Liberal Party, and Miko Tripalo, a reform Communist from the Tito era (who died late last year). Their book defies fashionable "Bosnia-pessimism" and ends with an affirmation of faith in a liberal, non-confessional and multicultural Bosnia.

</p><p><p>MRTVI POKAPAJU ZIVE</p>
</p><p>1. BUDUCNOST KAO SJECANJE NA PROSLOST
</p><p>Zagreb, 2. kolovoza 1992.
</p><p>Bezbroj puta se pitam postoji li cvrst vremenski redoslijed: proslost, sadasnjost, buducnost, jer mi se cesto buducnost cini kao sjecanje na proslost. U nas umjesto da zivi pokapaju mrtve, sve vise mrtvi pokapaju zive. U besanim nocima proteklih godinu dana, kada se nije moglo pomoci onima koji su trazili pomoc, kada se nisu mogli sprijeciti zlocini, ubojstva i bezbroj nesreca, cesto sam razmisljao o nasoj proslosti, sadasnjosti i buducnosti. Neprestano su mi se vracale neke slike koje su me progonile i koje su bitno odredivale moje ponasanje. Osjecao sam cesto kao da nam brojne generacije moga naroda, koje su se stoljecima jednako casno borile kao i ova nasa generacija, ali nisu uspjele stvoriti vlastitu drzavu, daju snagu da izdrzimo i da vjerujemo u uspjeh i onda kada racionalno ne mozemo pronaci razloge za optimizam. I osobno zivotno iskustvo i moja proslost bitno su utjecali na moje ponasanje, jer se kroz moj fivot na stanovit nacin prelamala, kao i u vecine Hrvata, sudbina moga naroda. Golema kolicina nesrece mojim kolegama u Uzem kabinetu Vlade i meni u najtezim trenucima, kada smo trenutno morali donositi odluke o divotu i smrti, davala nam je neku posebnu snagu, jer smo znali da mladi Ijudski zivoti koji su ugradeni u novu drzavu zahtijevaju da svaki od nas ucini mnogo vise od onoga s-to moze. Zato smo bili spremni na sva ponizenja i zrtve, kako bi ipak na kraju uspjeli. Bili smo spremni raditi sve ono sto u normalnim uvjetima nikad ne bismo radili. Znali smo da jedino nacelo Wjedan za sve, svi za jednoga~~ vodi uspjehu. To je zapravo i bila poruka brojnih generacija iz nase proslosti sadasnjem narastaju. testo u proslosti nismo uspjeli jer je uvijek bilo snaga u hrvatskom narodu koje su se oslanjale na neku silu izvan svoga naroda, bilo na Beograd, bilo na Veneciju, bilo na Bec ili Budimpestu.
</p><p>Danas, 2. kolowza 1992., upravo na dan novih izbora je godisnjica formiranja Vlade demokratskog jedinstva. U tih godinu dana mi iz Uzeg kabineta ostarili smo barem za pet godina, jer smo u tim zgusnutim povijesnim zbivanjima prezivjeli takve stresove i lomove kakve covjok ne prezivi u cijelome svom zivotu. Svi smo pomalo i bolesni i istroseni. O svemu tome razmisljam dok se vracam na dan izbora s Braca i iz Splita i dok gledam nase more i nase otoke, koji tu stoje i koji ce iduce tisucljece stajati, bez obzira na to kakva ce biti nasa buducnost i sudVina. Osjecam prazninu jer ovim izborima na danasnji dan sigurno zavrsava za mene jedna od najburnijih i najtezih, ali i najoasnijih godina u mom zivotu, kao i u zivotu svih nas koji smo bili u Vladi demokratskog jedinstva.
</p><p>Toliko se toga dogodilo, pa osjecam potrebu da o svemu pisem onako kako sam to dozivio. Svjestan sam subjektivnosti i "rasomonske" situacije, tj. razlicitih dozivljaja istih dogadaja. Zato ne pretendiram da je jedino moje stajaliste istinito. Tekst u ovoj knjizi moja je subjektivna istina. To je istina kakvu sam ja dozivio i prezivio. Vec duze vrijeme osjecam kako je doslo vrijeme da podvucem crtu ispod onoga sto je bilo i da pokusam ocijeniti proslost i radi istine, ali i radi nase sadasnjosti i buducosti, jer borba za proslost uvijek je i borba za sadasnjost i buducnost.
</p><p>Ovih dana, kako intenzivno radim na knjizi, sve viDe uvidam koliko proslost predodreduje buducnost, kako pojedinog covjeka tako i cijelog naroda. Sve vise sam uvjeren da su neki dogadaji bitno utjecali na sve ono s-to sam radio i uradio. Is to tako sve vise vjerujem da se neke stvari jednostavno nisu mogle promijeniti, usprkos nastojanju svih nas da se ne dogode. Pomalo sam i fatalist. Vjerujem u sudbinu, vjerujem da je vrijeme relativno i da postoji buducnost koja se vec dogodila, samo je mi jos ne znamo. Zivot covjeka je kao snimljeni film. On ima pocetak i kraj, a mi smo gledatelji koji ne znaju kraj filma, iako on vec postoji. U ovom ratu, kao nikada dosad, cesto sam razmisljao o smislu zivota. Pitao sam se kako je moguce da Ijudska bica cine sve to sto su u ovom ratu cinila i sto jos cine. Nisam vjernik, ali vjerujem u ljudsku dusu, cak vjerujem da dusu imaju i oni koji cine najteze zlocine. testo se u svojim razmisljanjima vracam na Huxleyjev esej wRaj i pakao", u kojem poznati pisac govori da raj i pakao postoje u dusi svakog covjeka, da nisu neko mjesto izvan nas nego su u nama, kao i da u svakom covjeku postoji neprestana borba izmedu dobra i zla. Opisujuci bit raznih religija Huxley tvrdi da je smisao zivota u pripremi za smrt, odnosno da je trenutak umiranja najvazniji trenutak, jer ovisno o stanju duse, je li u stanju raja ili pakla, ona u vjecnosti ostaje u onom stanju u kojem je bila prilikom same smrti. Zato sve religije zapravo pripremaju covjeka da u trenutku umiranja bude u stanju mira, blazenstva, u stanju raja, a ne u stanju pakla. Svi oni koji su izazvali ovaj rat, koji su krivi za zlocine, koji su cinili zlocine i jos ih cine, morat ce se suociti s istinom i paklom u kojem ce se naci kad budu umirali. Zato sam stalao nastojao da uvjerim hrvatski narod kako je najvaznije u ovom ratu, s jedne strane, cvrsto braniti vlastitu slobodu, ali kako je jos vaznije cvrsto sacuvati svoju dusu i ne dopustiti pojedincima da na zlocin odgovore zlocinom. Nazalost, u tome nismo potpuno uspjeli, usprkos svim mjerama koje smo poduzimali. Zato mi je najvece priznanje koje sam dobio bilo upravo priznanje Ijudi vjernika, svecenika, casnih sestara i drugih, koji su mnogo pridonijeli da u ovom krvavom ratu nas narod sacuva svoju dusu, da ne podlegne napastima osvete i zlocina. <br>

</p><p>KONTINUITET ILI DISKONTINUITET HRVATSKE POLITIKE PREMA BOSNI I HERCEGOVINI
</p><p>1. DILEME I RASKRIZJA ERVATSKE POLITIKE
</p><p>U hrvatskoj politici, u svim razdobljima borbe za stvaranje i priznanje hrvatske drzave i u njezinoj obrani od agresije, postojalo je nekoliko kljucnih dilema na kojima je dolazilo do velikih politickih raskola i sukoba. Pa i u vrijeme kada je izgledalo da postoji puna suglasnost svih bitnih snaga hrvatskoga drustva o strategiji hrvatske politike, bilo je mnogo strateskih razlika pa i raskola koji su se prikrivali od javnosti. Medutim, razlike, kolikogod bile velike, nikada nisu dovodile u pitanje visok stupanj sloge i odlucnosti u hrvatskom narodu, u domovini i dijaspori, da se slom komunizma u svijetu iskoristi za konacno stvaranje suverene i samostalne hrvatske drzave, te da se to nastoji postici sa sto manje zrtava. Medutim, od pocetka postoje razlike u pitanju kako to ostvariti. Treba li odmah izaci s jasnom platformom stvaranja samostalne hrvatske drzave ili ici korak po korak, u skladu sa uvjetima, taktizirati, te u pocetku, dok se ne stvore uvjeti, ne isticati konacni cilj. Mislim da su bili u pravu oni, a u njih se i ja ubrajam, koji su, vodeci racuna o odnosima snaga u svjetskoj politici koja je dugo vremena htjela po svaku cijenu sacuvati Jugoslaviju, inzistirali na postupnom ostvarivanju konacnog cilja i na tome da se on ne smije odmah javno potpuno definirati. To je znacilo da je bilo- ispravno nakon Titova odlaska i Miloseviceva pokusaja da SKY pretvori u svoje glavno oruzje uspostavlyanja centralisticke Jugoslavije koMa bi bila optimalna Velika Srbiya, inzistirati na obrani A VNOJ-a i Ustava iz 1974. godine, te teziste politicke borbe usmMeriti na razbijanje Saveza komunista JugoslavEje kao instrumenta u rukama Slobodana Milosevica. To razdoblVe zavrseno je XIM kongresom ISaveza komunista Jugoslavije.
</p><p>U drugoj fazi, nakon sloma Saveza komunista Jugoslavije na XIV. kongresu trebalo je sto je prije moguce osigurati promjenu ustavnog uredenya i s-to mirniji prijelaz s jednopartijskog na visestranacki parlamentarni sustav te od komunisticwBog u gradanski sustav. To je ucinjeno raspisivanjem prvih tisestranackih izbora i mirnom predajom vlasti. Zatim je trebalo uspostaviti sto je moguce cvrsci antivelikosrpski i antimilosevicevski savez, te s odredenim taktickim potezima uz Sloveniju i Bosnu i Hercegovinu dobiti i Makedoniju kao saveznike koji ce prihvatiti model konfederacije nasuprot MilosevicevoJ koncepciji federacije. Iako je bilo jasno da je konfederacija takticki potez kojim ce se dobiti na vremenu igra se morala igrati ozbiljno; Milosevica se moralo dovesti u poziciju da on i Srbija odbace ideju konfederacije. To nije bilo tesko ni predvidjeti ni izvesti, jer kriza je i pocela kada je Milosevic, provodeci Memorandum SANU, odlucio srusiti Ustav iz 1974. godine, koji je imao neke elemente konfederacije Dakle, bilo je jasno da Srbija nece prihvatiti konfederaciju, jer nije prihvacala ni Ustav iz 1974. godine; bili su uvjereni da imaju vojnu silu i podrsku medunarodne zajednice da, ako je potrebno, i silom odrze Jugoslaviju kao cjelovitu drzavu u kojoj ce svi Srbi ne samo zivjeti u jednoj drzavi, nego i ostvariti punu dominaciju. Tek kada Srbija odbaci ideju konfederacije, trebalo je izaci s jasnim cilyem: stvaranje suverene i samostalne Hrvatske, sto je pravodobno i ucinjeno.
</p><p>Nasuprot takvom postupnom ostvarivanju naseg glavnog cilja, stvaranja samostalne i suverene Hrvatske u njezinim medunarodno priznatim granicama na osnovi Ustava iz 1974. godine, i u Hrvatskoj su bile jake nacionalne snage koje su bile nestrpljive, koje su odmah zeljele u borbu za konacni cil; - samostalnu i nezavisnu Hrvatsku, ali ne samo u granicama po Ustavu iz 1974., nego i u njezinim povijesnim i prirodnim granicama, te su isticani zahtjevi o hrvatskoj zastavi na Romaniji i o granici na Drini. tak se stvorila i euforija kako je to lako ostvarivo. Takvo euforicno raspolozenje pridobilo je vecinu naroda za radikalan program, a protiv taktiziranja i postupne borbe za samostalnu i suverenu Hrvatsku. Mislim da su predsjednik Tudman i HDZ ispravno ocijenili situaciju i vrlo uspMesno odigrali dvostruku igru. Da bi dobili podrsku vecine naroda i da bi na velikim cilyevima uyedinili hrvatski narod, deklarativno su u predizbornoj kampanji prihvatili radikalan program Hrvatske do Drine, i na njemu su dobili izbore. A stvarno, prihvatili su realan program postupne borbe za samostalnu Hrvatsku, korak po korak. U praksi su provodili realan program onih snaga koje su izgubile izbore jer nisu bile dovolyno radika, Ine, jer su nudile postupnost i oprez. <br>

</p><p>Ideja za knjigu koja je upravo pred vama rodila se pocetkom 1994., u jednom od onih dramaticnih trenutaka koji se u valovima, jos od 1991., srucuju na Bosnu i Hercegovinu, nekadasnju republiku ex-Jugoslavije, a danas zemlju cija je sudbina krajnje neizvjesna. Iako punopravna clanica Ujedinjenih nacija, drzava priznata od mnogih zemaLja, Bosna i Hercegovina jos uvijek, u teskim i, najcesce, dramaticnim prilikama, trazi novi drzavni i politicki entitet, jer joj ovaj postojeci gotovo svi, i unutar i izvan nje, osporavaju.
</p><p>Razapeta unutarnjim civilizacijskim, religijskim, kulturnim i drugim razlikama, Bosna i Hercegovina je svoju drzavnu i politicku samosvojnost ostvarivala s mukom i sukobima, njena se povijesna putanja sudarala s razlicitim interesima, cesto i onima koji su se doimali dalekima i nestvarnima. Takva Bosna i Hercegovima, svojom unutarnjom slozenoscu, istovremeno izlozena budnom oku planera strateskih pomicanja u evropskim sredistima politicke i ekonomske moci, uvijek je bila predmet zanimljivih politickih i znanstvenih rasprava.
</p><p>Knjiga OKOVANA BOSNA nastavak je toga nepreglednog niza tragalackih napora, i s hrvatske strane, da se bosanskohercegovacka situacija odmjeri iz jos jednog kuta i tako pripomogne iznalazenju demokratskih i humanih rjesenja za ovaj prostor, prepun boli, ljudske patnje i stradanja. Ovo je zapis susreta na Bledu, u proljece 1994., gdje su se uz Adila ZulfikarpaKic'a, jednu od najmarkantnijih licnosti u politickom zivotu Bosne i Hercegovine, okupili istaknuti hrvatski intelektualci i politicari prof. Ivo Banac, Miko Tripalo i Vlado Gotovac; Mladen Malocwa, hrvatski novinar i izdavac, bio je moderator diskusije i priredivac knjige.
</p><p>Njihov razgovor, na trenutke polemican i, ocigledno, u mnogim pitanjima prozet razlikama, primjer je kako se i o tim, naizgled nerjesivim pitanjima, i razliditim stajalistima usprkos, moze razgovarati s dignitetom, otvoreno i demokratski.
</p><p>Iako, zbog stjecaja razlicitih okolnosti, do objavljivanja ove knjige dolazi gotovo godinu i pol kasnije, ona je u mnogim svojim dijelovima aadrzala svjezinu i aktualnost. Na svoj nacin, i ta spoznaja govori da problemi s kojima se u ovom trenutku suocava Bosna i Hercegovina nisu od jucer, nego su duboko uronjeni u njeno bice. Rjesenja koja su se do sada nudila za Bosnu i Hercegovinu u nacelu nisu previse vodila racuna o toj cinjenici, i to je, vjerojatno, razlog sto su mnoga od njih tako kratko potrajala. Nastojeci odrediti Bosnu, jedan knjizovnik jednom rece: Bosna, to je covjek! - pokazujuci tako svima koji kroje karte njene sudbine i njene buducnosti, zbog cega se Bosna ne moze dijeliti. Sudionici bledskih razgovora nastojali su se voditi tom cinjenicom i to je, izmedu ostaloga, njihovim razmisljanjima dalo ne samo svje&#163;inu nego i utvrdilo crtu kojom bi se, mozda, trebalo kretati u traganju za demokratskim rjesenjima bosanskohercegovacke krize.
</p><p>Posljednji dogadaji, u vrijeme predavanja ove knjige u tisak, a narocito Zenevski-dogovor ministara vanjskih poslova Hrvatske, Bosne i Hercegovine i ostatka Jugoslavije, potvrdili su koliko su bile opravdane strepnje, iskazane u ovdje predstavljenom proslogodisnjem razgovoru, strepnje za politicku sudbinu Bosne i Hercegovine i opstanak Bosnjaka-muslimana. U svoj svojoj brutalnosti, u trenutku kada se nazirao konacan uspjeh oslobodilacke borbe, pristupilo se konacnom komadanju i razaranju hiljadugodisnjega bica Bosne, iskustva i tradicije, na kojima se stoljecima zasnivao zajednicki zivot triju naroda. Tim se cinom nastavlja tragedija Bosne i njenih naroda, a prije svega Bosnjaka- muslimana.
</p><p>Poruka iz ove knjige, da samo jedinstvena i samosvojna Bosna i Hercegovina moze biti faktor stabilnosti i mira na ovim prostorima, po svoj prilici ne odgovara trenutnim politickim interesima i ambicijama onih koji u ovorn momentu odlucuju o njenoj sudbini. MesIutim, to ne umanjuje vrijednost ove poruke, niti otvara sumnju u njenu trajnost, nego ponajvise govori o politickoj kratkovidnosti, sebicnosti i zaslijepljenosti onih do kojih ta poruka ne dolazi. Posljedice takva politickog sljepila i neodgovornosti mjere se stotinama tisuca zrtava i novom nadolazecom katastrofom nesagledivih razmjera, ako se genevski dogovor pocne tstvarivati.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
<p>
</p><p><p>BEFORE CHRISTIANITY</p>
</p><p>At the beginning of the Christian era, the region which we now call the Middle East was disputed, for neither the first nor the last time in the thousands of years of its recorded history, between two mighty imperial powers. The western half of the region, consisting of the countries round the eastern Mediterranean from the Bosphorus to the Nile delta, had all become part of the Roman Empire. Its ancient civilizations had fallen into decline, and its ancient cities were ruled by Roman governors or native puppet princes. The eastern half of the region belonged to another vast empire, which the Greeks, and after them the Romans, called 'Persia', and which its inhabitants call 'Iran'.
</p><p>The political map of the region, both in its outward form and in the realities which it represents, was very different from the present day. The names of the countries were not the same, nor were the territorial entities which they designated. Most of the peoples who lived in them at that time spoke different languages and professed different religions from those of today. Some even of the few exceptions are more apparent than real, representing a conscious evocation of a rediscovered antiquity rather than an uninterrupted survival of ancient traditions.
</p><p>The map of southwest Asia and northeast Africa, in the era of Perso- Roman domination and rivalry, was also very different from that of the more ancient Middle Eastern empires and cultures, most of which had been conquered and assimilated by stronger neighbours long before the Macedonian phalanx, the Roman legion, or the Persian cataphract established their domination. Of the older cultures that had survived until the beginning of the Christian era, retaining something of their old identity and their old language, the most ancient was surely that of Egypt. Sharply defined by both geography and history, Egypt consists of the lower valley and the delta of the Nile, bounded by the eastern and western deserts and the sea in the north. Its civilization was already thousands of years old when the conquerors came, and yet, despite successive conquests by the Persians, the Greeks, and the Romans, Egyptian civilization had preserved much of its distinctive quality.
</p><p>The ancient Egyptian language and writing had, in the course of the millennia, undergone several changes, but show a remarkable continuity. Both the ancient hieroglyphic script and the so-called demotic, a more cursive style of writing which succeeded it, survived into the early Christian centuries, when they were finally supplanted by Coptic - the last form of the ancient Egyptian language, transcribed in an alphabet adapted from the Greek, with additional letters derived from demotic. The Coptic script first appears in the second century BCE and was stabilized in the first century CE. With the conversion of the Egyptians to Christianity, it became the national cultural language of Christian Egypt under Roman and then under Byzantine rule. After the Islamic Arab conquest and the subsequent Islamization and Arabization of Egypt, even those Egyptians who remained Christian adopted the Arabic language. They are still called Copts, but the Coptic language gradually died out and survives at the present day only in the liturgy of the Coptic Church. Egypt had acquired a new identity.
</p><p>The country has had many names. The name used by the Greeks, the Romans, and the modern world, though not by the Egyptians, is 'Egypt', a Greek adaptation from an ancient Egyptian original. The second syllable is probably from the same root as the name 'Copt'. The Arabic name is Misr, brought by the Arab conquerors and still in use at the present day. It is related to the Semitic names for Egypt found in the Hebrew Bible and other ancient texts.
</p><p>The other early river valley civilization of the Middle East, that of the Tigris and the Euphrates, may be even older than that of Egypt, but it shows neither the unity nor the continuity of Egyptian state and society. The south, the centre, and the north were often the seats of different peoples speaking different languages, and known by a number of names Sumer and Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia. In the Hebrew Bible, it is called Aram Naharayim, Aram of the Two Rivers. In the Graeco-Roman world, it was called Mesopotamia, which conveys much the same meaning. In the early Christian centuries, the centre and the south were firmly in the hands of the Persians, who indeed had their imperial capital at Ctesiphon, not far from the present site of Baghdad. The name Baghdad itself is Persian, and means 'God gave'. It was the name of a village at the place where, centuries later, the Arabs established a new imperial capital. <br>

</p><p>
</p><p>The birthplace of three religions and many civilizations, the Middle East was for centuries a major centre of knowledge and ideas, of techniques and commodities and, at times, of military and political power.
</p><p>In this immensely readable and wide-ranging book the historian Bernard Lewis charts the successive transformations of the Middle East, beginning with the two great empires, the Roman and the Persian, which disputed the region two thousand years ago; the development of monotheism and the growth of Christianity; the astonishingly rapid rise and spread of Islam over a vast area; the waves of invaders from the east and the Mongol hordes of Jengiz Khan; the rise of the Ottoman Turks in Anatolia, the Mamluks in Egypt and the Safavids in Iran; the peak and decline of the great Ottoman state, and the changing balance of power between the Muslim and Christian worlds.
</p><p>Bernard Lewis describes the forces which shaped the history of the Middle East: the Islamic religion and legal system; the traditions of government; the immense variety of trade and the remarkably wide range of crops; the elites - military, commercial, religious, intellectual and artistic - and the commonalty, including such socially distinct group as slaves, women and unbelievers.
</p><p>In the final section of the book Professor Lewis looks at pervasive impact, in modern times, of Western ideas and technology, and the responses and reactions they evoked. Rich in vivid detail and the knowledge of a great scholar, this brilliant survey of the history and civilizations of the Middle East reveals the huge Islamic contribution to European life, as well as the European contribution to the Islamic world. <br>

<h1>Middle East without prejudice</h1>

<p><b>A sweeping new history of the Middle East shows the diversity of its past and smashes many current stereotypes</b></p><ul><li><a href="3ex25.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> M<font size=-1>IDDLE</font> E<font size=-1>AST</font></a>: 2000 Y<font size=-1>EARS</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> H<font size=-1>ISTORY</font> <font size=-1>FROM</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> R<font size=-1>ISE</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> C<font size=-1>HRISTIANITY</font> <font size=-1>TO</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> P<font size=-1>RESENT</font> D<font size=-1>AY</font>&nbsp; By Bernard Lewis.<br>
</ul><ul></ul>

<p>THE term "Middle East" is a 20th-century creation, given currency by an American admiral and writer on geopolitics, Alfred Thayer Mahan, in 1902. But the countries it encompasses have a history that spans millennia. More pertinently, the Middle East includes a much greater variety of society and culture than common stereotypes allow. Despite all attempts to freeze or enforce an identity, be it imperial, religious or ethnic, the states and peoples of the Middle East have always learnt and taken from each other.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What gives the region unity, and justifies writing a broad history, is this story of interaction. Bernard Lewis has chosen an even wider canvas than his subtitle suggests: one of his themes is that before even the rise of Christianity and Islam, the region was being shaped by Iran, by Egypt and by the settled civilisations of southern Arabia. Beneath later appearances of uniformity, diversity continued: the spread of the Islamic armies in the seventh century was at first comparatively light, leaving religious and administrative structures intact, and regional attempts to create a single political entity were disrupted by conflicts within the Muslim empires.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anyone wanting support for the idea that in "Islam" the spiritual and the secular are fused, or for the idea that Islamic states have in some fundamental way been different from other states, will be disappointed--but also freed from pointless argument. For history's answer to so many current quarrels--Does Islam permit separate states or secular rules? Is Islam compatible with nationalism?--is an emphatic "yes". The realism in the words of a ninth-century <i>wazir</i> in Baghdad has a modern ring: "The basis of government is jugglery. If it works, and lasts, it becomes policy."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Lewis is also concerned to balance a view of the region as essentially an Arab civilisation. Again and again Iran appears as a source of influence. The rise of the Turks in the 11th century produces a third major contribution, and one that lasted, in its imperial Ottoman form, until this present century.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Europe is present as a target of invasion up to the 17th century and as an encroaching economic and political force thereafter. But, on Mr Lewis's time-scale, more weight is given to the influence of Central Asia and China. Commercially, west and east Asia were linked by silk and pottery. Militarily, it was the comparative strength of China in the east that pushed the Huns, Mongols and Turks to the west.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The impact of European modernity forms the main subject of the book's last part, which goes up to the present day. Mr Lewis's concluding judgment is that, for better or worse, the peoples of the Middle East are now on their own. They can, he says, no longer count on outside support for propping up or getting rid of dictators and they have no grounds any more for blaming their problems on outsiders. This bracing message needs stating, and stating again, for it is sinking into the political discourse of the Middle East all too slowly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Without footnotes, this is by intention a general book. The lucid narrative is backed up by maps and by a rich chronology. But it is no bland summary. Mr Lewis engages openly in many controversies. He includes assessments and throw-away lines that will intrigue and infuriate. Mr Lewis's judgment that "In the earnestness and seriousness of their loyalty to Islam the Turks are equalled by no other people" is likely to make some of the faithful elsewhere sit up. His stress on the importance of Sufism, a popular and critical belief linked to mysticism, brings out a dimension of Islamic life that outsiders too often miss. Sufism is indispensable to an understanding of the thought of Ayatollah Khomeini, as it is to the politics of contemporary Turkey and the Caucasus, and perhaps to Bosnia too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Lewis is particularly good on shifts in religious belief and in the language of politics and power. Summaries of political and economic history are combined with detailed expositions of the meaning of <i>jihad</i> and of terms of authority. On other questions he is less sure and less successful. His chapter on the ruled, as opposed to their rulers, is entitled "The Commonalty". Yet women rate but a paragraph and the mass of the labouring population scarcely more. The account of the Iranian revolution misses the degree to which its highly politicised ideas drew on western concepts: no Koranic <i>sura</i> (chapter) enjoins revolution, economic development or independence. The judgment that, in the Arab-Israeli dispute, outside powers should be blamed for stopping one side from defeating the other rings oddly at a time when some Israelis and some Palestinians, though haggling, are at least trying to work out a way of living together.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This overview invites comparison with the brilliant work with which Mr Lewis began his professional writing career over four decades ago, "The Arabs in History". Yet while it covers much of the same ground, with undiminished erudition and fluency, there are, in addition to a broader geographical and temporal scope, some differences. It is perhaps significant that, while in the earlier book the overthrow of the Ummayad empire in the ninth century was described as a revolution, comparable to those of France and Russia, it is the rise of Islam itself which is now cited as revolutionary, and the comparison with the events of 1789 and 1917 is reserved for the Islamic Revolution of Iran.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A summary of a life's reading and reflection, this is, quibbles apart, a fine and challenging book. It gently corrects many illusions about the Middle East and restores to Mr Lewis a calm authority that his engagement in certain over-heated recent controversies seemed to have ruffled.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Above all, it is a historian's tribute to the people of the Middle East, which refutes on almost every page the common image of social stagnation or cultural irrationality. This book will remind every reader, including those from the Middle East itself, how diverse and ever-changing this region has always been.

</p><p><p>* The Anglo-Zulu War seen from the Zulu perspective</p>
</p><p>* Essential reading for all interested in the Zulu military force
</p><p>In January 1879 the forces of the independent Zulu kingdom inflicted a devastating defeat on the invading British army at Isandlwana. Yet the Zulu army was not a regular professional one like its British counterpart; it was in fact the manpower of the Zulu state, mobilised temporarily in the military service of the king. The Anatomy of the Zulu Army describes how this army functioned, and examines its role in the broader context of Zulu culture and custom.
</p><p>After surveying the Zulu army from its creation during the wars of Shaka in the early nineteenth century onwards, Ian Knight focuses in detail on the structure and condition of the Zulu army on the eve of war in 1879. Through the means of age-regiments (the amabutho), Zulu men were called up regularly to serve the king, for non-military purposes as well as to fight his wars. Ian Knight explains how these men were enlisted, trained and housed, what they wore, what weapons they carried, their ornate ceremonial costumes, what duties they performed, and what rewards they expected. He considers how the army was viewed by its colonial neighbours, and how misconceptions contributed to the confrontation with the British. And, most importantly, he reveals how the Zulu army functioned in wartime, from complex preparatory rituals to battlefield tactics, and the shock of battle itself. <br>

<h2>Blood on the veld</h2><ul><li><a href="3ex36.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> A<font size=-1>NATOMY</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> Z<font size=-1>ULU</font> A<font size=-1>RMY</font> <font size=-1>FROM</font> S<font size=-1>HAKA</font> <font size=-1>TO</font> C<font size=-1>ETSHWAYO</font></a>: 1818-1879&nbsp; By Ian Knight.<br>
</ul>

<p>IN A desperate appeal for annexation, Mohesh described his people as "the lice in the Queen's blanket". The plea won the Basutho chief sympathy in Victorian London but also amiable contempt. The British recruited compliant Africans to help them run the empire. They reserved their admiration for the proud warrior tribes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fearsome Masai of East Africa, with lion-killing as a rite of passage, excited the British imagination. So did the Matabele of southern Africa, who gave Cecil Rhodes a run for his pots of money. And, after they broke a British square, Kipling wrote a famous bit of doggerel in praise of the Fuzzy-Wuzzy: "So 'ere's to you Fuzzy-Wuzzy, at your 'ome in the Soudan; You're a pore benighted 'eathen but a first-class fightin' man." But no Africans were more noble in the eyes of imperial Britain than the Zulu.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Ian Knight shows, the prowess of the Zulu was no myth. In 1879, at the battle of Isandlwana, Zulu warriors armed mainly with knobkerries, throwing spears and assegais, and protected by shields made from animal hides, wiped out a modern British army equipped with artillery, rockets and Gatling machine-guns.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The descriptions of battle, particularly of close combat where "the killing achieved levels of stark primeval savagery", are not for the squeamish. Unlike Stephen Taylor in his much broader "Shaka's Children: A History of the Zulu People" (HarperCollins; 1994), Mr Knight is interested only in how the Zulu kingdom created such a magnificent army, and what made the army tick. He examines how Zulu warriors were enlisted, trained and accommodated, how they were led and fed, and what they believed, what they wore and how they were equipped. His account provides a mesmerising read for those who like their history concentrated and straight.

<p>
</p><p><p>Breaking the Rope</p>
</p><p>There is an old story told in Zululand, even today, about the rivalry between the British empire and the independent Zulu kingdom on the eve of the 1879 Anglo-Zulu War. Like all good stories, it is almost certainly apocryphal, and it seems to have gained its greatest currency in the last years of the nineteenth century, when the full impact of the Zulu military defeat had become obvious to all levels of society. The story refers to a time before the war, which even then was assuming all the mythic status of a vanished golden age; King Cetshwayo kaMpande was on the throne, and the kingdom had never seemed richer or more powerful. Yet the true situation was very different, for in fact the balance of regional power had already shifted south across the Thukela river, to the neighbouring territory of Natal, where the British had ruled since 1843. The British and the Zulus were being propelled into conflict by deep political and economic rivalries, the full implications of which were scarcely recognised in the Zulu heartland. When the first tensions arose, so the story has it, King Cetshwayo sent a container of millet, uphoko, to Natal's Secretary for Native Affairs, Theophilus Shepstone. It was a gesture which implied both a boast and a veiled threat, a warning not to interfere in the affairs of a strong nation: 'If you can count the number of grains in this uphoko', the king's message ran, 'then you will have counted the number of the Zulu people.' Shepstone, who was never one to shirk a theatrical gesture himself, immediately sent back to the king a bullock hide. 'Ah,' he is said to have replied, 'but if you can count the hairs on this hide, then you will know how many are the English.'
</p><p>It is, of course, a story that is only poignant with hindsight, for by the time it became widely believed, the bitter underlying truth of the parable was all too apparent. Tension had given way to military confrontation, and the Zulus, whose military prowess had been renowned across southern Africa, had been broken and humiliated. On no less than three occasions, their army had defeated the British in the field: once, at Isandlwana, that defeat had been as spectacular as any endured by the imperial power in the nineteenth century. Yet in the end, the courage of the Zulu people had proved an ineffective armour against the might of European industrial technology. The grand heroic charges of the massed amabutho, the king's regiments, had withered before the storm of shot and shell, and the invaders, thrusting right into the heart of the Zulu country, had defeated the king on the very threshold of his royal homestead. The great settlements which embodied the power of the Zulu royal house were razed to the ground, and Cetshwayo himself captured and sent into exile. Few Zulu families escaped without a father, brother or son being struck down or wounded in the struggle. In the bitter years that followed, the country fell apart into civil war, and the people were drawn increasingly into a colonial system which dismissed their culture and traditions and valued them only as a source of cheap labour. King Cetshwayo's container of millet was indeed spilt upon the ground, and the hairs on the hide of European ascendancy grew more luxuriant than ever.
</p><p>The coming of the whites Ironically, early relations between the British and the Zulu kingdom had been good. European settlement in the sub-continent dated back to 1652, when the Dutch East India Company had occupied the Cape peninsula establishing a victualling station for their ships on the long haul from Europe to the profitable markets of the Indies. Although the company proved reluctant to expand into the hinterland, it was unable to contain its own settler population, that mixture of Dutch, German and French religious refugees who came in time to think of themselves as Afrikaners - white Africans - or, with simple pride, Boers - farmers. As the settler community expanded slowly eastward, so it clashed with the robust African societies who inhabited the rolling downland of the eastern Cape. In 1806 as part of the fall-out from the wide-ranging conflicts in post- Revolutionary Europe, Britain took over control of the Cape from the Dutch, inheriting a complex and tense situation which deteriorated still further over the next half-century. <br>

</p><p>'This was a country of corpses and orphans and terrible absences. This was where the spirit withered.' So begins Fergal Keane's powerful account of the Rwandan genocide, in which more than a million people have been killed. Keane's book is a memoir of what he calls a terrible voyage: a deeply personal account of an encounter with evil. 'I had seen war before, l had seen the face of cruelty,' he writes, 'but Rwanda belonged in a nightmare zone where my capacity to understand, much less rationalize, was overwhelmed.'
</p><p>He tells the story of a journey in which he and his BBC colleagues tracked down one of the most notorious mass murderers of the conflict and escaped massacre by Hutu extremists. He examines how tens of thousands of ordinary Hutus were mobilized by their political leaders to massacre members of the Tutsi minority, as well as moderate Hutu politicians. Keane rejects the widely held perception that Rwanda's slaughter was the simple consequence of tribal antagonisms. Instead he blames unscrupulous politicians for fomenting ethnic rivalry and planning a systematic campaign of genocide. Season of Blood is a harrowing story told by a reporter who travelled into the heart of the horror. 'It changed everybody. The survivors most of all of course. But also the doctors, the aid workers, the priests, the journalists. We had learned something about the soul of man which would leave us with nightmares long into the future.'
</p><p>This is not a comfortable book. It will shock and disturb. But it is a necessary book, telling a story that must be told. <br>

</ul>



<p>DOES the world need to know where the knife went in? How many times the axe chopped through flesh and bone? Yes, says the journalist. Usually. Rwanda was different.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In April 1994 the South African election had drawn every journalist in Africa southwards (many thought the voting would end in violence). The aeroplane crash at Kigali on April 6th 1994 which killed the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi did not distract them. Nor did the reports of subsequent killings in the Rwandan capital. Editors did not want to hear about a nasty war between two groups with silly names in a tiny African country.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the story came out in dribs and drabs and did not quite get told for a long time. When the journalists did arrive, they soon ran out of words and images. Up close the story was untellable. Some even found their motivation to go on telling it began to dry up. The adrenalin which normally drives their search for the story and getting it out suddenly dissipated.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But they had nightmares for weeks after. One journalist described how she kept dreaming about finding friends lying dead around her house. Another went home saying he did not want his wife and children, he did not want anyone, to read about what he had witnessed. The rest of the world simply did not need to know about this.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fergal Keane went to Rwanda in the aftermath of the genocide to make a television programme. The flyleaf of his "Season of Blood" describes it as: "A necessary book, telling a story that must be told." For whom? Certainly for Mr Keane. He describes how the immensity of the evil has destroyed something in him, how Rwanda keeps a hold on his consciousness as no other story ever has done.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His flowing prose describes the bodies bobbing in the Kagera river and the piles of corpses at Nyarubuye parish, but he fails to discover why almost all the Hutus in Rwanda participated in the methodical murder of their Tutsi neighbours. (In many instances when they grew tired and hungry from so much chopping and stabbing and slashing, they slit the Achilles tendons of their victims and returned to kill them after lunch.) The book that comes closest to answering the question why remains G&eacute;rard Prunier's "The Rwanda Crisis: History of Genocide" (Columbia University; Hurst; 1995).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sudan is also a state which has a deep ethnic divide. In fact it has several but the one which has grown into war is between the Arabic-speaking, Islamic north and the black African, animist or Christian, south. Francis Deng, a Sudanese foreign minister turned academic, has written an excellent analysis of this division that actually offers some solutions. An assertive and intolerant Islamist government in the north will never be able to unite the country, says Mr Deng. He accepts that the huge gap between north and south, cultural, political and religious, means that "partition may be the only option".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike Rwanda, Sudan could be partitioned, although it would leave large numbers of non-Muslims in what would, on present trends, become an Islamist state. There are some 2m southerners in and around Khartoum, already vulnerable to the whims of state officials. If Sudan broke up, they would need some international protection or Sudan could become an even more ghastly place than it is today.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the Rwanda crisis broke there was hardly a recent book in French on the country and no book in English. Perhaps that neglect contributed to Rwanda's isolation and the inability of the world to understand and respond to the crisis there. In which case, Mr Deng has done Sudan a great favour. The world has been told.

</p><p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p>
</p><p>Travellers
</p><p>The road south is narrow and endless. We have been driving since early morning, and the green hill country has begun to lose focus. It is a blur on to which have been painted occasional villages in shades of muddy brown and the burned yellow of banana thatch. At each Ugandan village small boys run to the edge of the road, offering cokes and bananas for sale. Some of them thrust skewers of burned meat, rancid and charcoal black, through the window. At first we found them entertaining, almost dancing in front of us, cheering excitedly as we approached. Now, seven hours later, they are tiresome, another hazard of the road along with the cattle and goats. Any journey, even towards war, becomes a matter of routine if it goes on long enough. In the distance I see mountains slowly revealing themselves as the rain clouds retreat into the east. Appearing out of the countless smaller hills, these mountains appear fantastically large. 'Those mountains are Rwanda,' says Moses, his head hunched over the steering wheel. Moses Baale is one of our two drivers. He is forty-five years old and once served as a soldier in the army of Idi Amin. 'I was made to go into the army,' he told me apologetically. When the Tanzanians invaded Uganda and overthrew Amin, Moses deserted, hiding his uniform in the bush and running as fast as he could back to his family. From the outset Moses has made it clear that he does not want to go to Rwanda. But his job is to drive people wherever they want to go, and he has accepted this mission because it is his job. 'Me, I have the wife and two children back in Kampala. The kids are going to school,' he says, 'and I need to get money. I am not here otherwise, believe me.'
</p><p>Having survived the madness of the Amin years, Moses feels that he deserves better than dying in Rwanda. We have spent much of the morning reassuring him, but I sense he does not believe us. His partner Edward is driving the second Land Rover. Edward is younger, around twenty-five or twenty-six, and much less worried about the danger. He constantly asks about money. How much did the cameras cost? How much do we get paid? He likes to wear a bowler hat and walks with the half slouch, half prowl of a city boy. Tall and handsome and impulsive, Edward does not like taking instructions. Already we have clashed with him over his driving, urging him not to shoot ahead of Moses. He listens to us with an expression that is balanced somewhere between contempt and a grudging acceptance of our authority. 'Fine, fine, that's just fine,' he says, and proceeds to drive even faster. But Edward has an advantage over the rest of us. He his been into Rwanda twice. Just the previous week he drove down as far as Kigali, through the ruined towns and the empty villages. <br>

<p>
</p><p><p>Chapter 1</p>
</p><p>Overview of the Conflict
</p><p>Highlighting the salient elements in the Sudanese conflict may help to illustrate the complexities of the nation's situation. Foremost of these is the historical process that has dichotomized the country into North and South. Historians have argued that without the South there would be no North. This is even more true of the South; without the confrontation with the North, the still vivid history of rapacious invasions by northern slave raiders, and the more recent attempts by the post-independence governments to dominate the southern peoples, there would be no South as a viable political entity. A corollary of the process is the polarization that has afflicted the country with a crisis of national identity. This crisis has in turn led the parties to adopt extreme positions, which are now represented by Islamic fundamentalism in the North and a radical counterforce in the South. Together these factors pose important policy considerations on which rest the prospects for conflict resolution and the choices the parties will have to make in addressing the critical issues involved.
</p><p>HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
</p><p>The historical process that has separated the Arab Muslim North and the African South has its roots in the Arabization and Islamization of the North and in the resistance to those forces in the South. The assimilation processes favored the Arab religion and culture over the African race, religions, and cultures, which remained prevalent in the South.
</p><p>Sudanese contact and interaction with the Middle East via Egypt date back thousands of years before Christ, taking the form of trade in ivory, gold, and other commodities. Arab traders settled among the indigenous population and integrated themselves. They had the advantages of wealth, with which the Sudanese wanted to associate, and eventually the Sudanese identified with the Arabs. The process intensified after the advent of Islam in the seventh century. The Arab Muslim empire invaded the Sudan, and, in the seventh and ninth centuries, concluded peace accords with the northern peoples of Nubia and Beja. These accords established remote Arab controls over the country, opened the channels of communication with the Arab world, guaranteed freedom of movement for the Arabs, protected Arab trade, and safeguarded Arab settlement, but otherwise left the Sudanese in relative peace, autonomy, and independence. Although the Arab settlers were traders and not rulers, their privileged position, their more cosmopolitan and universalizing religious culture, and their superior material wealth, combined with the liberal assimilationist Arab-Islamic tradition, opened gates to universal brotherhood and made them an appealing class for intermarriage with the leading Sudanese families. As Arabs did not come with their wives, and as Islam did not permit the marriage of Muslim women to non-Muslims, intermarriage was a one-way street. It is generally accepted that the descendants of the Arabs succeeded to the leadership positions of their maternal families through the system of matrilineal succession then prevalent in the North. The patriarchal system then took over and perpetuated the Arab-Muslim male line. The children identified with the paternal line, and, in the course of time, the Arab element predominated. The pre-Islamic system was not so much overthrown as "turned inside out."
</p><p>Arab migration and settlement in the South, in contrast to the situation in the North, were discouraged by natural barriers, the difficulties of living conditions, including the harshness of the tropical climate for a people accustomed to the desert, and the resistance of the warrior Nilotic tribes. The few Arab adventurers who engaged in slave raids were not interested in Arabizing and Islamizing the southerners, as that would have taken their prey from dar al-harb (land of war) and placed them in the category of dar al-lslam (land of Islam), thereby protecting them from slavery.
</p><p>In 1820-21 joint Turkish and Egyptian forces invaded and took over the northern regions of the Sudan. The Islam practiced by these rulers was hardly recognized as such by the Sudanese, who characterized them as foreign infidels. <br>

</p><p>
</p><p>The civil war that has raged intermittently in the Sudan since independence in 1956 is a conflict of contrasting and seemingly incompatible identities in the Northern and Southern parts of the country. Identity is seen as a function of how people identify themselves and are identified by others in terms of race, ethnicity, culture, language, and religion. The identity question relates to how such concepts determine or influence participation and distribution in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the country.
</p><p>War of Visions sheds light on the anomalies of the identity conflict and presents competing models: the Arab-Islamic mold of the North, representing two thirds of the country in territory and population, and the remaining Southern third, which is indigenously African in race, ethnicity, culture, and religion, with an educated Christianized elite. But although the North is popularly defined as racially Arab, the people are a hybrid of Arab and African elements, with the African physical characteristics predominating in most tribal groups.
</p><p>This configuration is the result of a historical process that stratified races, cultures, and religions and fostered a "passing" into the Arab-Islamic mold that discriminated against the African race and cultures. The outcome of this process is a polarization that is based more on myth that on the realities of the situation. The identity crisis has been further complicated by the fact that Northerners want to fashion the country on the basis of their Arab-Islamic identity, while the South is decidedly resistant.
</p><p>Francis M. Deng presents three alternative approaches to ending the long, raging conflict of identities: establishing a new basis for creating a common identity; creating a framework of diversified coexistence within a loose federal or confederal arrangement; or partitioning the country along justified borders. <br>

<p>THE Beardstown ladies are an only-in-America phenomenon. A combination of real appeal and media hyperbole has turned these mostly elderly members of a successful Illinois investment club into celebrities. In popular imagination, they rival even Warren Buffett, a famously folksy and sage long-term investor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since 1983, when their present investment club was formed, the 16 ladies have had an average annual return of around 23%--well above the 16% return on the overall stockmarket in which they invest. Few professional money managers have done as well. Even so, their financial shrewdness might have gone unnoticed but for equal canniness with the press.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1994 the group published "The Beardstown Ladies' Common-sense Investment Guide", which mixed investment advice with homespun wisdom and jokey recipes (for instance, stockmarket muffins that are guaranteed to rise). A bestseller, it helped launch thousands of new investment clubs. These days the ladies schmooze so much on talk-shows, it must be hard scheduling investment meetings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Folksiness, however, should rarely be taken at face value. Most of the ladies have professional backgrounds and are far more sophisticated than they let on. Nor is it deemed polite to note that they owe their success to a couple of exceptional shares, and that their portfolio is worth not millions but something over $100,000.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Their new book is a well-intentioned attempt to cash in on fame. It contains advice on investing ("we like stocks and stock mutual funds for long-term retirement planning") but is mainly an easy-to-read guide to financial planning. The book taps the puritanical meanness that is deep-rooted in American culture, yet at odds with today's consumerism. Readers will no doubt be thrilled to save a few dollars a year by making their own sandwiches, by taking coffee to work in a thermos flask and by making a few dollars from recycling lazy colleagues' soft-drink cans. Invest all this money in the stockmarket, wait for it to grow and then buy that dream ranch. In effect, the ladies are doing their bit to boost America's feeble personal savings rate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All in all, the ladies' advice is not startling: investing is not the mystery it seems and it is never too late to save for retirement. What is clever is to serve up these commonsense truths with recipes and anecdotes to make them more homely and palatable.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It was a complete surprise to each and every one of us. All we set out to do was write a book about how our investment club picks good-quality growth stocks and show people how they can do the same.
</p><p>All of a sudden, we were famous.
</p><p>It started in December 1994 when, except for Shirley and Hazel who remained home for health reasons, we all flew to New York to be on Donahue. Only three of us had ever visited New York (a wonderful place, but where do they learn to drive like that?), and two of us, Ruth and Elsie, had never even flown.
</p><p>"I'd lived threequarters of a century and never been on an airplane," Ruth says. "I always wanted to but never thought I'd get the chance."
</p><p>Just a couple hours before the show, we almost lost three members of our club. Margaret, Carol, and Buffy decided to go shopping, searching for Oakley sunglasses and Polo purses. They were havingso much fun they nearly forgot why they were in New York in the first place. Two enormous white limousines were to arrive any minute to take them to Donahue! So they jumped in a cab and headed back to the hotel.
</p><p>As the cab driver raced through the city streets, nothing looked familiar.
</p><p>"It was hard to communicate," Carol says. "He didn't speak much English, and we were stuffed in the backseat with packages up to our chins."
</p><p>Margaret told him, "Just take us to Lincoln Center."
</p><p>"Where?" the cab driver asked.
</p><p>"Lincoln Center!" Margaret exclaimed. "The cultural arts capital of America!"
</p><p>As it turned out, we were all on time for Donahue - those sunglasses and Polo purses are quite stunning - and the rest is history. At least it's history in Beardstown. <br>

<p><b>The German chancellor</b></p>

</ul>

<p>HE SEEMS to get bigger and bigger in every way. It is not just a matter of girth, though in writing a cookery book jointly with Hannelore, his wife, Helmut Kohl indicated that he was not looking for any slowdown in growth there; in two bites he will demolish a hamburger that takes a lesser mortal ten. His stature as a world leader seems to grow bigger too as Margaret Thatcher, Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand and others of his political stature depart and as his commitment to a federal Europe looks an increasingly lonely pursuit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Maybe the years also set him apart from other leading politicians. Come November he will have been chancellor for longer than Konrad Adenauer was--14 years and one month. But there is another reason for his remoteness which Karl Hugo Pruys rightly dwells upon in his biography in German of this political "monster" (the author's word, and one that somehow shocks because Mr Pruys served as Mr Kohl's parliamentary spokesman). The chancellor has no intimate friends.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He is above friendship, except of the world-ordering kind with such people as Boris Yeltsin or Bill Clinton. With them, his strong sense of history brings out a sentimental streak larded with goodwill. Embracing them is to embrace huge notions like reconciliation, security and the destiny of Europe. Otherwise, as it is with friends, so it is with would-be heirs. The worst thing that can happen to a rising politician in his Christian Democratic Party is to be touted as a potential successor to Mr Kohl. Pretty soon he is not. The chancellor sees to that. He seems ever more solitary too in German foreign policy, making it himself. Since the retirement of Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the job of German foreign minister has seemed increasingly redundant.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kohl's monster-quality is his obsession with politics. He does precious little else, save indulge in the pleasures of the table. He positioned himself in his surprisingly lean mid-40s (some of the photographs in this book are a treat) to become conservative candidate for chancellor after discovering that he was quick to make decisions. And he has been quick--sometimes embarrassingly so, as when he took Ronald Reagan to a war cemetery where it turned out that some <i>Waffen-</i><font size=-1>SS</font> men were buried. More impressively, he jumped at the chance of German unification when others hesitated; he swapped the D-mark for East Germans' worthless Ost-marks to sustain unification; and he laid down the principles of Maastricht with Mitterrand to advance his vision of European integration, starting with a common currency.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A shortcoming of Mr Pruys's biography is that he does not reach big conclusions or draw the big picture. His insider's account is a compendium of a thousand Kohl-bites. He could plead that it is too early for any measured analysis of Mr Kohl. But for ordinary Germans the "monster" does seem to have pulled off an extraordinary feat at the end of a horrifying century. He has put things right with Russia, Israel, Poland, France, the Netherlands and the other nations which, in their different ways, had most to hold against Hitler's Germany. They had still not quite come around to accepting Germany's good intentions until Helmut Kohl came along.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
<p>
</p><p><p>1. Kindheit und Jugend 1930-1950</p>
</p><p>Lob der Herkunft
</p><p>Der Vater, und der Grossvater muetterlicherseits, waren Beamte, nicht in herausgehobenen Stellungen, sondern Manner, die bei ihrer Berufsausubung unmittelbaren Kontakt mit den Leuten hatten. Auf beide ist Helmut Kohl ein Leben lang mit einer familiaer bedingten, voreingenommenen Dankbarkeit stolz.  Mit den haeufigen lobenden Erwahnungen vornehmlich dieser Ahnen mochte sich der augenscheinlich staatsloyal erzogene Buerger, den die Geschichtsbuecher einmal als den langstdienenden Kanzler der Bundesrepublik Deutschland verzeichnen werden, ab ovo in ein guenstiges Licht stellen.
</p><p>Grossvater Kohl dagegen bleibt in ein merkwuerdiges Dunkel gehuellt. Wir erfahren aus einem Bericht, den der Politiker Kohl fuer einen Sammelband mit Beitraegen ueber die Elternhaeuser prominenter Zeitgenossen verfasst hat, dass sein Vater einer ,,baeuerlichen Dreizehnkinderfamilie entstammte, die im Unterfraenkischen ansaessig war" . Mehr nicht. Sein Vater, dem er den abgekuerzten Vornamen ,,Hans" verpasst, vermutlich dessen Rufname, wurde auf ,,Johann Kaspar" getauft und verliess das Elternhaus offenbar schon mit vierzehn Jahren, um bei einem Muellermeister und dessen Ehefrau unterzukriechen, die ihn an Sohnes statt annahmen. Der elterliche Hof war zuvor niedergebrannt, und die dadurch in Armut gestuerzte Familie offenbar froh, eines der vielen Kinder andernorts untergebracht zu wissen. Der ,,Kindersegen", von dem fromme Familien in jenen Tagen noch zu sprechen pflegten, hatte sich zu einer ziemlich ausweglosen Situation fuer einen Bauern ohne Haus und Hof gewendet. Fuenf Kinder erlebten ihren zehnten Geburtstag nicht, zwei starben im fruehen Alter von kaum zwei Jahren. In Greussenheim nahe Wuerzburg besuchte Hans die Schule, einige Jahre nach Adam Stegerwald, dem beruehmten Sozialpolitiker der Weimarer Republik und spaeterem Leitbild der Christlich-Demokratischen Arbeitnehmerschaft, wie Sohn Helmut spaeter nicht ohne beziehungsreichen Hintersinn berichtet. Danach diente Hans in einem bayerischen Regiment, und nach dem Kriege zog es ihn in den sicheren Staatsdienst. Als Finanzsekretaer sah sich Hans Kohl nach einigen Jahren beruflich hinreichend ausstaffiert, um 1921 die zweite Tochter des Lehrers Peter Josef Schnur, der aus dem Hunsrueck kam, zu heiraten.
</p><p>Die Verhaltnisse, in die Helmut Joseph Michael am 3. April des unruhigenJahres 1930 als drittes und letztes Kind von Caecilie Elisabeth und Hans Kohl in der Chemiestadt Ludwigshafen hineingeboren wird, sind von Luxus weit entfernt, aber auch nicht unkomfortabel. Sie sind im besten Sinne geordnet: man hat ein eigenes Dach ueber dem Kopf, verfuegt ueber sieben Zimmer, dazu Kueche und Keller, allerlei Nebenraeume und einen voluminoesen Speicher. Der Garten bietet alles, was die Hausfrau an Kartoffeln, Gemuese und Kraeutern in der Kuche benoetigt. Grossvater Peter Josef Schnur, in dessen Haus im Ludwigshafener Ortsteil Friesenheim die Eltern gezogen sind, hat vierzig Obstbaeume hinterlassen, die meisten von ihm noch selbst okuliert. Helmut lernt den Alten nicht mehr kennen, weil der kurz vor seiner Geburt gestorben ist. Die Erinnerung an den Paedagogen mit musischen Leidenschaften wird im Elternhaus wachgehalten. Peter Josef Schnur, einer Lehrerdynastie entstammend, liebte das Orgelspiel und leitete den Kirchenchor. Er war, wie  man noch lange nach seinem Tode zu berichten weiss, im Orte angesehen, ja geliebt. Ob er tatsaechlich ein ,,begnadeter" Paedagoge gewesen ist, darueber gibt es allenfalls muendliche Zeugnisse wohlmeinender Ludwigshafener Buerger, die unterdessen Gelegenheit hatten, ,,ihren" grossen Sohn Helmut Kohl zu feiern. Solche Urteile fallen nur allzu oft in das Reich besonnter Vergangenheit. Tatsache bleibt, dass sein Enkel Helmut ihn als ,,Inbegriff eines Lehrers"  empfindet, sobald er sich in die Lage versetzt sieht, Gedanken ueber seine Vorvater anzustellen. <br>

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
<p>
</p><p><p>TOWARDS A NEW ROUND 1979-86</p>
</p><p>In November 1979, the governments of 99 countries formally completed the Tokyo Round of negotiations, held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). These had been the most ambitious worldwide trade negotiations ever undertaken up to that time. Launched in Tokyo in September 1973, with the probably unrealistic expectation that the Round could be completed within 27 months, the negotiations had taken more than six years of work in Geneva to bring to conclusion. Their success, often in doubt, had demanded a degree of political attention and commitment from world leaders for which there was no precedent in international trade relations. Several participants declared that the experiment of negotiating on so many trade issues at once should never be repeated. Even those who were convinced that the Tokyo Round's results could only have been won as a package deal looked forward, in 1979, to a long respite from major negotiations. The 1980s were seen as the years in which GATT, now reshaped to meet the current needs of international trade, could peacefully bring into effect the tariff reductions agreed to in the Round, apply and extend the new disciplines negotiated for non-tariff distortions of trade, and work out the implications of the agreements reached on the role of developing countries in the trading system and on the settlement of trade disputes. Many developing countries, disappointed at what they saw as meagre results from the GATT bargaining process, turned their attention to negotiations among themselves, and to the more congenial forum of the United Nations. Trade negotiations threatened to slip off the agenda of international policy makers, already grappling with the direct consequences of the second great oil-price shock, and soon to be faced by the debt crisis of Africa and Latin America.
</p><p>Exactly six years later, on 28 November 1985, GATT member governments took the key decision to start preparations for a new and even more ambitious round of multilateral trade negotiations. This chapter traces the steps by which the international community moved from the Tokyo Round to the Uruguay Round.
</p><p>Aftermath of the Tokyo Round
</p><p>The end of the Tokyo Round left GATT members with no lack of work to be done. The results had to be put into force-a far more substantial task than with previous GATT negotiations. Earlier GATT rounds had been largely devoted to reducing import duties, a task which, once agreed, fell on the individual governments concerned. The Tokyo Round also achieved large tariff cuts: the industrialized countries agreed to reduce their import duties by an average of about one-third. However, the core of the Round's results consisted of separate multilateral agreements whose main aim was to reduce or control non-tariff distortions of trade. These "codes" were not self-executing; they had to be brought into effect by their signatories (for the most part, the developed countries) and steered by their individual management bodies. Seven such agreements were to come into effect at the beginning of 1980, and two more in January 1981. Further new "framework" agreements called for regular review of developments in the trading system, and in particular of protective measures affecting the interests of developing countries. Moreover, part of the agreed bargain in concluding the Tokyo Round, and in accepting the tariff-cutting results, the codes and the framework agreements was that the door should be kept open for later action on issues which had not been dealt with effectively. Thus negotiations were to continue on reform of the GATT rules on safeguard action (the use of temporary restrictions against imports that are disrupting domestic producers), an issue generally agreed to be the main piece of unfinished business of the Tokyo Round. Countries heavily dependent on exports of agricultural products, who had obtained little from the Round, won agreement that GATT should look more closely at how greater progress could be made in future in this sector. "Structural adjustment", at that time a code- name used primarily for policy proposals that would encourage a shift of some industries from developed to developing countries, was to be studied. All these matters were embodied in an agreed work programme, with a final promise that GATT's Consultative Group of Eighteen, a small but representative group of senior trade officials, could look into such other proposals for future work as might be put forward by governments. <br>

Introduction: City of Dreamers and Doers
<p>WHEN Louis Sullivan arrived in Chicago from the East to begin his architectural career, he felt he had been chosen for a special destiny and that this rejuvenated city was "the place"- for him. Ashes and debris still covered much of the city in 1873, but no one wanted to talk about the ruins. All interest centered on the rebuilding. The past seemed to have no meaning to these incessantly forward pushing people, and civic patriotism was the prevailing religion. "Big"--or rather, "biggest"--was the word on every Chicagoan's lips, Sullivan recalled in his autobiography. Chicago was the "biggest" livestock, lumber, and grain market in the world and the "biggest" railroad center. Chicagoans even boasted that theirs had been "the biggest conflagration 'in the world."' But the Chicago "shouters," as Sullivan called them, were not spinning tales. There were powerful builders and visionaries in this city of superlatives, and seventeen-year-old Sullivan "thought it all magnificent and wild: A crude extravaganza: An intoxicating rawness."</p>
<p>After apprenticing for seven months in a firm headed by William Le Baron Jenney, Sullivan left for Paris to continue his studies, and when he returned in 1875, work was hard to find because the city was in the grip of an economic depression. So for Sullivan this became a time of preparation, a chance, as he put it, "to get the lay of the land." Every day he would walk twenty miles or more around Chicago and out into the yellow prairie that stretched beyond it. What explained this raw, robust place? That gave it its impelling drive, the "sense of big things to be done" and the will to carry them through?</p>
<p>Nature gave him the first clue. She had favored Chicago with an unrivaled agricultural hinterland, which Sullivan had first seen from the window of his inbound train from Philadelphia "stretching like a Hoor to the far horizon." "Here," he thought, "was power--power greater than the mountains." Then there was the inland sea, silver blue Lake Michigan, born, like the prairie, of the slow advance and retreat of ancient ice sheets. It opened Chicago to the lumber lands to the north, to the ports of the East, and from them, to the world. On occasions when bad weather kept the lumber fleet in port, Sullivan would watch, as the skies cleared, the long lake schooners "pour in a stream" from the mouth of the Chicago River, "spread their wings, and in a great and beautiful flock, gleam in the sunlight as they moved with favoring wind, fan-like towards Muskegon and the northern ports." Without the lake, "born companion" of the prairie, there would be no Chicago, he realized. But Sullivan saw the key to it all in the old portage, a narrow ridge of marshland, long since built over, between the Chicago River--the city's busy harbor--and a prairie river, the Des Plaines, that reached the Mississippi via the Illinois. That low divide over which Indians and French traders had portaged their canoes linked Chicago to the vast, resource- rich midcontinent. Nature had thus set the stage for Chicago, "offspring," Sullivan called it, "of the prairie, the lake and the portage."</p>
<p>Nature had not created Chicago, however; she had merely made it possible. The city would not have been set on its course had not men of energy and empire first envisioned and then cut a canal through the portage. While Chicago's earliest historians insisted that geography had determined the city's future, Sullivan, the architect, saw city building as a supremely human art. Nature provided opportunities as well as constraints, but cities and civilizations were the work "of proud people and their power to create." If ever there was a place shaped by the actions of "big men," surely it was Chicago, Sullivan thought. </p>

The rise of Chicago is a great American story. Chicago grew from a desolate
fur-trading post of some thirty settlers to the most dynamic city in North
America, if not the world, in the lifetime of one of its early residents. In the
1830s Chicago barely existed, but by 1893 it had beaten out New York as the
site of the World's Columbian Exposition, with its still-famous "White City."
Chicago then was a center of power and culture, the metropolis of the new and
the revolutionary, a place people visited to see the shape of the future. It was
the city of the century.
<p>The epic of Chicago is the story of the emergence of modern America. The same forces and personalities that created Chicago helped make America the most powerful national in the world by 1900. Chicago was widely considered the most typically American of the nation's big cities, a scene of boiling economic activity and technological ingenuity, American industrialism's supreme urban creation. "Here of all her cities," wrote the novelist Frank Norris, "throbbed the true life--the true power and spirit of America."</p>
<p>Chicago was also a city of extreme, even violent contrasts. Although it was the most "American" of cities, more than three quarters of its residents were of foreign parentage in 1893. Garden city of parks and tree-bordered boulevards, it nevertheless had most of its streets filled with uncollected horse manure and putrid animal corpses. Temperance capital of the country--headquarters of Frances Willard's Woman's Christian Temperance Union--it had one saloon for every two hundred persons, and its world-famous vice district operated around the clock with police protection. Home of the empire-building capitalists Philip Armour, George Pullman, and Marshall Field, Chicago was the center of the nation's trade-union and anarchist movements and the site of some of the most violent labor disturbances of the industrial age. A city supposedly given over entirely to money-making, it produced some of the finest young writers and reporters of the late nineteenth century, as well as an amazing group of architects and engineers--Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, William Le Baron Jenney, and John Welborn Root--who invented modern urban architecture and with it the steelframe skyscraper, the most audacious engineering achievement since the Gothic cathedrals.</p>
<p>Theodore Dreiser thought Chicago a symbol of a "tremendous" American future; Rudyard Kipling said that having seen Chicago he urgently desired never to see it again. But no matter how observers differed in their reactions, few disputed Henry Adams's conviction that nineteenth-century Chicago was the best place to observe "the new energies" of the age. A city ahead of its time, Chicago foretold the major conflicts and challenges of the new world of science, technology, and rapid social change that Americans anticipated with fear and fascination.</p>
<p>City of idealists and dissenters, builders and visionaries, thieving aldermen and plundering capitalists, nineteenth-century Chicago was the site of some of the greatest achievements and failures of American urban life. The story of its unresolved struggle between order and freedom, growth and control, capitalism and community, remains instructive for our time, as we seek ways to build and maintain cities that retain their humanity without losing their energy.</p>
<p>Donald Miller's powerful narrative embraces the entire urban drama-- Chicago's wild beginnings, its reckless growth, its natural calamities (especially the Great Fire of 1871), its raucous politics, its empire-building businessmen, its world-transforming architecture, its rich mix of ethnic cultures, its community of young writers and journalists, and its staggering engineering projects--which included the reversal of the Chicago River and raising the entire city from prairie mud to save it from devastating cholera epidemics.</p>
<p>Beautifully written and filled with fresh insights, City of the Century throbs with the pulse of the great city it brilliantly brings to life. </p>

</ul>


<p>AMAZED by Berlin's late-19th-century building boom, Mark Twain joked that the German capital made "even Chicago seem old". More than 100 years on much of downtown Chicago looks positively historic. The torch of newness long since passed elsewhere. While Berlin is again a giant building site, Chicago's developers are taking a break for digestion. Even its 110-storey Sears Tower, once a symbol of over-reaching modernity, has lost the tag of the world's tallest building to the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The briefest tour of Chicago takes you back to a classic era of modern architecture, to offices by Louis Sullivan, low houses by Frank Lloyd Wright and a justly famous mid-century skyline. This was a time of brimming confidence in new design, when nature, technology and society, or so it seemed, all worked in harmony. A local newspaperman and poet-patriot, Carl Sandburg, voiced this hopefulness when he said that the city's soaring buildings would need "hinges on the top two storeys to let the moon go by".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not for lack of moonlight that Ross Miller takes a dark view of his subject--the past 30 years or so of city development in Chicago. The story begins in the 1960s when the city administration of the late Richard Daley encouraged huge building projects as a way to revive Chicago's downtown area. It continues as the uncelebrated Amoco, Hancock and Sears skyscrapers duly rise up and ends with the hog-fest of commercial over-building in the 1980s for which Chicago is still paying. As an emblem of these failures, Ross Miller focuses on a three-acre chunk of downtown land known as "Block 37"--a boarded-up site that was razed for construction but perversely never built on.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though Ross Miller's angry disillusion makes for a lively read, his judgments are often overbroad and the book bogs down in wearisome details of deals and double-crosses among Chicago's big developers. It could have said more about city planners and given wider scope to Ross Miller's eye as an architectural critic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Quite different in tone is "City of the Century" by a historian, Donald Miller. His topic is the city's growth, in all its variety, from 1830 to 1893. Inspired by an earlier urban historian and mentor, Lewis Mumford, he seeks to use the buildings of Chicago as an archival historian would use documents. Though even for "city biography" this method has its limits, Donald Miller lovingly describes the work of the great builders of late-19th-century Chicago, Daniel Burnham, John Root and Sullivan, who brilliantly exploited the steel frame, powerful lifts and effective central heating. Though this ground has been covered before, Donald Miller deals more widely with the changing material face of the city, describing its railways, canals, meatpacking plants and steel mills. Engaging character-sketches break up a book whose rollicking, celebratory tone would otherwise grow tiresome (there is too much "biggest" this and "most dynamic" that).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Urban history is a stream and cut-offs are arbitrary. Chicago's World Fair in 1893 makes as good an end-point as any. But Donald Miller ignores it when he chooses, squeezing in marginally 19th-century figures like Thorstein Veblen, a social critic who started at the University of Chicago in 1892, as well as clearly 20th-century ones such as the novelist Theodore Dreiser, who grew up partly in Chicago, and Wright himself. Wright worked as a young draughtsman in Sullivan's office, and mocked his survival-of-the-fittest political theories as so much "baying at the moon". That was when you could still see it.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
1 LORD OF THE LOOP
<p>Richard J. Daley, six-term mayor of the city of Chicago, rose early every morning to survey his domain. The five-mile trip to City Hall was a chance to see firsthand how he was doing. A new fire station, lights for a schoolyard basketball court, a nice spring planting of trees, were all palpable signs of progress. Daley was right in the middle of things, calculating: adding each success and subtracting every nagging imperfection. His commissioner of Streets and Sanitation would hear before noon about the broken streetlight on Cermak and State, the plugged gutter at Roosevelt and Harrison, even the paper swirling in the wind outside the mayor's bungalow at 3536 South Lowe. Every new building was his triumph, every errant gum wrapper a personal affront. Before arriving at the office, he had many a time ordered his driver to stop so that he could get out and set right an overturned garbage can.</p>
<p>Problems he could see, go and fix, were his pleasure. Attending to those areas of governance that rewarded his direct involvement, and avoiding the rest, Daley produced results. He practiced human accounting: a ledger he kept himself that froze in place Chicago's violent competing interests from the day he first took office. The ins stayed in, the outs out. You were either on "good paper" with the mayor or out of business, permanently; Chicago was so neatly divided, in his mind, between the parts he controlled and those he didn't. Right up until the end, when the mayor died on the job December 20, 1976, it was hard to believe that Chicago, like every other older American city, was suffering steady decay. So efficiently had Daley hidden the city's problems behind a fa,cade of efficient leadership that it took two strokes in 1974 and a prolonged hospitalization in his last full term for the public to see that this madly personal system was truly breaking apart. Not until that late date, almost twenty years into his long reign, did the courts successfully attack the city's shameful segregated housing and public schools, its apartheid unions, dismantle the machine's extensive patronage system, and put many a Democratic regular in jail. Until then, Daley's Chicago was a gray Oz with one man fully in control. Under the mayor's spell, the city of Chicago was paradoxically open and closed at the same time. In his own person, he captured the city's mixture of rough and plain dealing, direct and roundabout. No use in trying to reconcile opposites. "The manifest Mayor Daley was incoherent and sometimes vulgar. There was another Mayor Daley, who was infinitely knowledgeable and subtle," longtime Chicago resident Saul Bellow concluded. "Both of these Daleys were real."' </p>

In the heart of downtown Chicago, on a square block surrounded by major civic
landmarks, there stands absolutely nothing. Why this desolation where there
should be a fabulous skyscraper, a vertical money machine? How did this three-
acre chunk of prime urban real estate, at one time the hub of a down-at-heel hut
bustling commercial district, become a blank eyesore, unused and unprofitable?
And what does this sad vacancy tell us about the fate not only of Chicago but of
nearly every American city in the aftermath of the Age of Excess?
<p>Here's the Deal is urban historian Ross Miller's hard-hitting, no-holds-barred answer to these troublesome questions. The redevelopment of Block 37, a richly historic site in the heart of the North Loop, was conceived by Mayor Richard J. Daley, his successors in City Hall, and an astonishingly brazen crew of schemers, speculators, pols, and operators as the way to transform an area of "urban commercial blight"--old, low-rise buildings filled with marginal if not seedy businesses--into a glittering tower that would not only be architecturally worthy of its neighbors (City Hall, Marshall Field's, the State of Illinois Building), but would, with its 2 million square feet of office space, throw off millions of tax and rental dollars annually. For twenty years, through five mayoral administrations, public officials and real estate entrepreneurs of every stripe wheeled and dealed. The three biggest developers in the Midwest were involved; the glamorous architect Helmut Jahn came up with a truly sensational design. "Here's the deal," they all told each other, while the booming eighties steamed ahead. But in the end, when the boom went bust, when credit dried up and downtown office space became the single thing the American city had too much of, then the "deal" was all there was.</p>
<p>Ross Miller, author of American Apocalypse: The Great Fire and the Myth of Chicago, knows Chicago, past and present, down to its paving stones. In writing Here's the Deal he talked to virtually everyone involved, both private citizens and municipal officials--and all of them talked to him, opened their files for him, and gave him access to the inside story. The result is investigative history at its finest, filled with the telling details and revealing anecdotes that bring an era and a neighborhood to life and then show us the tragedy of its decline.</p>
<p>The ruination of Block 37 is a quintessential Chicago story, and Ross Miller tells it with the passion of a native and the blistering honesty of a classic muckraker, laying the blame for this debacle squarely at the feet of those who should have cared most for the wellbeing of a great city. But he goes beyond "location" to show that this is a quintessential American story as well, one that holds important lessons for all of us. Block 37 is at once the site of a compelling human drama of overweening greed, backroom dealing and rampant neglect of the public weal--and an emblem of the perhaps irremediable disaster that has overtaken our urban society. Only by understanding what went wrong there can we hope to prevent "Block 37" from happening elsewhere. </p>

Fourth Galaxy, 4 November 2052: in the black sparkle of deep space a figure in
a blue coverall tumbles over and over as it drifts towards the planet Badr al-
Budur. No space suit, no helmet, no oxygen. He can't be alive, can he? But he
is. First Navigator Fremder Gorn is the only survivor when the Corporation
tanker Clever Daughter disappears. Nobody knows how he did it and
everybody, including Fremder himself, wants to know. Caroline Lovecraft,
Head of the Physio/Psycho Unit at Newton Centre, Hubble Straits, finds that
intimacy doesn't lead to answers. Pythia, the 23.7 billion-photoneuron Data
Evaluator at the Ziggurat, London Central, is free with sexual favours but gives
away none of her own secrets. Interwoven with Fremder's quest is the strange
history of his mother, Helen Gorn, inventor of flicker drive, and her brother
Isodor. Katya Mazur, Pythia's Tech 7, is drawn into Fremder's quest but he
must achieve the full realisation of who and what he is alone and in deep space
aboard Clever Daughter 11. Fremder's name means stranger, and his story, as
one would expect from Russell Hoban, is full of strangeness and brilliant
imagery.

</ul><ul></ul>

<p>ONCE upon a time readers consulted a biography, an encyclopedia, a historical textbook or some other source of factual information when they needed to know about something that had really happened--some deliciously scurrilous detail of a famous life, say, or an important political event. But many novelists are now treading the path pioneered by Norman Mailer and writing faction (definition: an artful mingling of fact and fiction). Read them and you can be informed and entertained at the same time--without always knowing which is which.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of this summer's biggest and most ambitious English-language novels--from America, Nigeria and England--are books of this kind. And one of the best of them is "The Last of the Savages", a dissection of the turbulent 1960s and their aftermath by Jay McInerney. His is the story of an unlikely friendship between Patrick, an Irish-Catholic boy from a dull New England mill town, and Will Savage, the flamboyant and unpredictable scion of a family from the Old South who is trying to put behind him his forebears' associations with slavery. The boys grow up together--at prep school and later at Yale. Patrick slips easily into a career as a corporate lawyer; his old friend Will, promoter of the new sound of soul and a kind of priest of the higher hippiedom, spins out of control.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This book, the fourth by this young New York writer, is intelligently paced, consistently funny and delightfully unpredictable. It is sensibly and believably anchored in historical fact, but the factual references never weigh too heavily on the reader's mind or interrupt the flow of the narrative.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The principal impediment to a fuller enjoyment of past novels by Ben Okri, the Nigerian who won the Booker Prize in 1991 for "The Famished Road", has been his tendency to indulge in vapidly rhapsodic writing. It has often been hard to tell whether he was describing dream or reality--and it did not seem to matter much anyway.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such acts of self-indulgence seldom mar Mr Okri's "Dangerous Love", which is a story of compound life in the straggling outskirts of Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital. This time he has given us credible characters--the painter, Omovo, for example, who is hopelessly in love with another man's wife; the girl herself, Ifeyiwa, and her cruelly pathetic and tyrannical husband.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The novel is set in the 1970s, and therefore in the aftermath of civil war between Odumegwu Ojukwu's Biafra and the forces of the federal government. Some abiding sense of the continuing destructiveness of that war, both physical and psychological, imbues the story with a special atmosphere from start to finish, and adds an almost indescribable feeling of tension, anxiety and hopelessness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it is in the descriptions of Lagos and the wretchedness of compound life itself that Mr Okri has really excelled himself this time. Note, for instance, how this subject matter gets absorbed into Omovo's paintings: "Metal. Hot road. Copper sun. Sweating drivers. Busy hawkers. Policemen accepting bribes. Lights on painted metal..."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Babel Tower" is by A. S. Byatt, an English novelist who won the Booker Prize a year before Mr Okri. At its heart is the story of a relationship between the clever daughter of a Yorkshire schoolmaster and the son of a "country" family whom she marries. The marriage is a disaster: the husband finds it inexplicable that his wife, who has experienced the social and sexual freedoms of university life in the 1960s, should be dissatisfied by a future of child-care and country idleness. He beats her. She runs away, taking their only son with her. The whole thing comes to trial: an acting out of the battle between the new freedoms of the 1960s and the older order represented by the judiciary.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Running in parallel with this story is another: the tale of another novel, "Babble Tower", which recounts the rise and fall of a Utopian community. The work is brought to trial for obscenity. Regrettably, large and tedious sections of archaic language from "Babble Tower", the book within a book, are quoted in the novel itself. Another fault is to dwell on the "issues" of the 1960s--sexual liberation, the pill and so on--in a pedagogical way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The subject of "I Was Amelia Earhart", a short first novel by Jane Mendelsohn, a young American author, is much as its title suggests: it is an ingenious elaboration upon the story of Amelia Earhart's last flight, which took place July 1937, as if spoken by that "goddess of flight" (as the press described her) herself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best bits are the details of Amelia Earhart's life: physical appearance and personal mannerisms that the novelist must have gleaned from her researches into the subject. The worst bits are the fanciful descriptions of what may "really" have happened to the aviatrix and her navigator after they lost radio contact and disappeared into the Pacific.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mary Kay Zuravleff's "The Frequency of Souls" is a much more praiseworthy first novel--if only because its setting is unusual, and must have demanded a lot of original research. Ms Zuravleff has delved into the world of refrigerator designers, an unexciting profession on the face of it but one which is just as likely to exhibit signs of real human life as any other.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;George Mahoney, her man, can see nothing beyond the plain, honest facts of the physical world until Niagara Spense, his new research colleague, arrives. Niagara may look outwardly unattractive, but her strange beliefs about the ability of souls not only to survive but also to communicate with the living, at first appals and then begins to fascinate stolid George. The novel does not travel far in the terms of its plot, but it is rich in humour and in its cunning observation of human behaviour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russell Hoban, an American long resident in London, has always written fiction which has been extremely difficult to categorise. And it is again so with "Fremder", a fascinating cocktail of futuristic fantasy and science fiction set in the middle of the 21st century.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difficulty with many sci-fi novels is that they are vehicles for interesting ideas--usually scientific or sociological--but such matters as characterisation or topography get too little attention. This is not the case with Mr Hoban's new novel. It introduces an earth transformed by decades of pollution and social unrest. Fremder himself is the lone survivor of an interplanetary expedition but nobody knows why or how he survived, not ever Fremder himself. The novel is the unravelling of this secret.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To fall at the 46th fence is regrettable, but Doris Lessing has managed to do it. Two years ago she wrote "Under My Skin", one of the most remarkable autobiographies to have appeared since the second world war. Now she has written one of the weakest and least plausible novels by an eminent writer within recent memory.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Love, Again" is a relentless tale of love, and of how an older woman can be in thrall to passion almost to the point of self-destruction. The woman in question is the director of a small London theatre company which is staging a play about a young woman who dies for love. The novel crawls along at the pace of a sun-struck snail, and as it does so it works its theme of star-crossed love <i>ad nauseam</i>. There are passages of great brilliance, especially in the opening pages when the reader is gulled into thinking that this is yet another remarkable book by Mrs Lessing, but the writing disappoints all too soon, and then it goes on and on and on disappointing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And finally from this recent crop of fiction comes something quite unexpected. Roddy Doyle, a fine comic novelist from Dublin, and yet another winner of the Booker Prize, has written something sad and moving. It is the story, told by herself, of an ordinary, 39-year-old working-class Dublin woman whose husband abuses and batters her. Reading "The Woman Who Walked Into Doors", which has no stylistic adornments whatsoever, is a sobre experience. It is all the more affecting for that--and more true to life than any biography, encyclopedia or historical textbook.

The capacity for friendship is God's way of apologizing for our families. At
least that's one way of explaining my unlikely fellowship with Will Savage.
<p>Though we hadn't spoken in weeks, maybe months, I thought of him the moment two New York City police detectives showed up at my office. I was taken aback, naturally, when my secretary announced them. The kind of law we practice here doesn't bring us in contact with the police. But their visit had nothing to do with Will Savage--they wanted to ask me about Felson. Ah, yes, officers. Please, sit down.</p>
<p>Saul Felson was in the tax department at my firm. Family man, active member of his temple, a doggedly brilliant lawyer who, even by the conservative standards of our white-shoe firm, was so colorless as to seem virtually transparent. Kind of a geek. We occasionally worked together, but I didn't know him well--I don't think anyone did--and nothing I could tell the detectives might explain how he'd ended up dead of multiple stab wounds in a seedy motel in the Bronx. Everyone's quite shaken, of course, and the partners will all be attending the funeral. I have to admit the whole affair has given me an acute intimation of mortality. At forty-seven, he was just a year older than me. Lately I've been wondering if Felson had a best friend. The visit from the detectives reminded me of the day the FBI came to interview me about mine. </p>

Omovo was emerging from a long dry season. When he looked at his face in
the mirror, and saw that his hair needed cutting, he didn't know that he was
emerging from a long dry season. The barber's shed was next door and when he
went there an apprentice told him that the master had gone home to Abeokuta
for a few days. Omovo asked whether he could still have his hair cut and the
apprentice replied enthusiastically:
'What kind of a question is dat? I have cut about five heads today. I cut them
well.'
<p>Omovo dozed offduring the haircut. When he woke up he found himself looking like a newly recruited policeman. He told the apprentice to cut his hair shorter. And as his hair got progressively shorter he thought he looked progressively worse. Exasperated, he told the apprentice to shave offthe whole damn thing. When the barber had finished, his head looked bony and angular in the large mirror. At first he was terrified. Then gradually the freshness of the experience grew on him. After paying the apprentice he gathered up the dark masses of his hair that were scattered on the floor, tied them in a cellophane wrapping, and went home amid taunts of 'Afaricorodo, shine-shine head' from the children around.</p>
<p>The next morning he went for one of his walks through the ghetto of Alaba. He had only gone a few hundred yards from home when an unexpected fine shower of rain started to fall. The flesh of his head tingled. He resolved not to run for cover and went on walking. He passed a building that had been burnt down in a fire the night before. Not far from the building some men were cutting down branches of a withered tree to use for firewood. Near the tree poorly dressed children were hitting a goat with sticks. He stopped and stared at the children and at the same time felt a shiver, which started from his head, run through his being. Something froze and then flashed within him. Something shimmered in the sky. He suddenly shouted: 'Leave the goat alone!'</p>
<p>The children stopped. They stared at his bony angular head. The goat they had been hitting trotted slowly towards the tree. The men looked at one another: one of them threw down a branch with dead leaves and the other one shouted: 'What's wrong? </p>

1.Facts on File
<p>Ever since he had built his first radio set from glass tubes and a spool of lead, George Mahoney remained convinced that the universe was soldered together with logic. That, in essence, was his philosophy, though there were corollaries, too: all supernatural phenomena, including what passed for miracles, were explicable; the dead were no longer among us; stars contained no truths for our future; and so on. This dogma had sustained him through such head trips as the Vietnam era, college during the early seventies, and sixteen years of marriage. Lately, however, in the slow afternoons when he was supposed to be advancing the cause of refrigerator design, George found himself watching his new office mate and reviewing his belief system.</p>
<p>Niagara Spense swiveled away from her computer and looked at George with an arched eyebrow that let him know he had been staring. For a number of reasons--her eyes, her size, her hearing aid--it was hard not to stare at the gangly girl scientist stationed at the next computer. Their assistant, Bev, had pointed out to George that Niagara sewed her own clothes, a dozen variations of a single prototype. Today she was wearing one in a gold paisley that was better suited to basement couches. George hadn't known women Niagara's age still sewed. It was a perfectly acceptable dress, maybe even one his wife, Judy, would wear. Short sleeves, no collar or buttons or belt. Each of the dresses had a tendency to slip off her left shoulder.</p>
<p>Before Niagara, George had only ever had one office mate, a bitter man with the personality of a snapping turtle. After forty winters on the project, the Veteran still said "icebox," and the one story he enjoyed telling, which George remembered like an earache, was how he had invented self-defrosting refrigerators to the surprise and betterment of the world. As the bells rang in 1992 and Coldpoint accounted for another slow year, the meanspirited pioneer had been forced to resign amid talk of massive layoffs. Scarcely a week after the Veteran's retirement lunch, Niagara Spense was brought in to take his place.</p>
<p>This cloudy spring morning that was sure to end in scattered showers, Niagara extracted a filament of hair from the temple of her glasses, where broken strands often hung like fishing line, and returned George's stare with a personal question. "How did you come to be in Rockville, Maryland, designing refrigerators?"</p>
<p>George thought that if he told Niagara his story, she might be more chatty. Despite their sharing a fifteen-by-fifteen-foot windowless office, George knew little about her other than what he had gleaned from her personnel file. Even that was sparse. She was twenty-eight years old to his thirty-nine; her parents were concert pianists; while her Caltech transcript shone with A's, she had left without a doctorate. Shackelford, their boss, had interviewed her by phone. His notes consisted of "Smart kid" and "Nice voice," each underlined until the lead broke through the paper. </p>

<p>In the deep chill and the darkness of the Fourth Galaxy, in the black sparkle of deep space, oh so lonely, see a figure in a blue coverall tumbling over and over as it comes towards you: no space suit, no helmet, no oxygen. Is he dead? He can't be alive, can he? What's in his mind now? Are there pictures frozen in his mind?</p>
<p>Pictures in the mind! Words also. Again last night I had the dream, the one in which it was made known to me, perhaps by a written message, perhaps by the sound of distant weeping, that the rats were lamenting the removal of their sacred objects. I have never dreamed this dream on the planet Badr al-Budur but perhaps one night I shall.</p>
<p>Badr al-Budur (everybody calls it Badru) in the Fourth Galaxy is a little off the beaten track: because of El-Nino variables in that sector you can't flicker to it, you have to go to Hubble Straits and jet from there. Badru is a place you stop at on the way to somewhere else, an in-between place, a middle-of-the-night scene change where you breathe bottled air that smells like LavaKleen and wait for the next jet to Erehwon or Xanadu or wherever.</p>
<p>There's nothing on Badru but the spaceport which is mostly empty except for robot sweepers humming through the echoing silence under dim blue noctolux lamps. Clocks, too, that tell you what day and time it is in London, Tokyo, New York, and so on. There's MIKHAIL'S QWIKSNAK, a multilingual cafeteria in pink, purple, red, blue, green, and yellow neon (with missing letters) where you can get GALAKT K MIKS, SPUDNIK FRY, KRASNAYA K LA, and indigestion or worse. Nearby is Mikhail's Bistro where you can get a better class of indigestion. Next to it is a gift shop where robots fluent in twenty currencies will sell you clockwork orreries made in New Taiwan, models of the Stephen Hawking, pornoscopes featuring the Arabian Nights Princess Badr al- Budur with her lover Qamar al-Zaman, key rings with bits of polished budurite, and tea towels that say, 'I'VE BEEN THRU BADRU. HAVE YOU?' Not surprisingly, Badru orbits the planet Qamar al-Zaman which is the rubbish tip for that sector.</p>
<p>There are a mini-cine and a cybercade in the spaceport but my favourite night spot on Badru is the Q-BO SLEEP that beckons in purple neon, SLEEP &amp; SHOWER IO CR. PER HOUR: each cube with its high-mileage futon, shower, sink, and toilet. The blankets have a grey prison look and the towels are only a little thicker than the toilet paper. To check in you insert your card and punch in your hours, then you get your Hi-REM or Dropout tab from the dispenser and you're bye-bye until your jump to Erehwon or Xanadu or wherever. </p>

<h2>L<font size=-1>OVE</font>, A<font size=-1>GAIN</font>.<br></h2>
<p> By Doris Lessing. <br>
<i>Flamingo; 340 pages; &#163;15.99. HarperCollins; $24</i>.<br>
</p><br>
<p><b>Extract</p></b>
EASY TO THINK this was a junkroom, silent and airless in a warm dusk, but
then a shadow moved, someone emerged from it to pull back curtains and
throw open windows. It was a woman, who now stepped quickly to a door and
went out, leaving it open. The room thus revealed was certainly over-full.
Along one wall were all the evidences of technical evolution - a fax machine, a
copy machine, a word processor, telephones - but as for the rest, the place could
easily be some kind of theatrical storeroom, with a gold bust of some Roman
female, much larger than life, masks, a crimson velvet curtain, posters, and
piles of sheet music, or rather photocopies that had faithfully reproduced
yellowing and crumbling originals.
<p>On the wall over the word processor was a large reproduction of Cezanne's Mardi Gras, also the worse for wear: it had been torn across and put together with sellotape.</p>
<p>The woman next door was energetically attending to something: objects were being moved about. Then she reappeared and stood looking in at the room.</p>
<p>Not a young woman, as it had been easy to imagine from the vigour of her movements when still half seen in the shadows. A woman of a certain age, as the French put it, or even a bit older, and not dressed to present herself, but wearing old trousers and shirt.</p>
<p>This woman was alert, full of energy, yet she did not seem pleased with what she looked at. However, she shook all that off and went to her processor, sat down, put out a hand to switch on a tape. At once the room was filled with the voice of the Countess Die, from eight centuries ago (or a voice able to persuade the listener she was the Countess) singing her timeless plaints:</p>
<p>I must sing, whether I will or not: I feel so much pain over him whose friend I hold myself, For I love him more than anything that is . . .</p>
<p>The modern woman, sitting with her hands ready to attack the keys, was conscious she felt superior to this long-ago sister, not to say condemning. She did not like this in herself. Was she getting intolerant?</p>
<p>Yesterday Mary had rung from the theatre to say that Patrick was in emotional disarray because he had fallen in love again, and she had responded with a sharp comment.</p>
<p>'Now, come on, Sarah,' Mary had rebuked her.</p>
<p>Then Sarah had agreed, and laughed at herself.</p>
<p>Feeling disquiet, however. There seems to be a rule that what you condemn will turn up sooner or later, to be lived through. Forced to eat your vomit - yes, Sarah knew this well enough. Somewhere in her past she had made a note: Beware of condemning other people, or watch out for yourself. </p>

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
I was told by a Guard who came to the door. He wasn't one I'd seen before, one
of the usual ones. He was only a young fella, skinny and with raw spots all over
his neck.
<p>--Missis Spencer?</p>
<p>He couldn't have been more than twenty. He looked miserable.</p>
<p>--Missis Spencer?</p>
<p>I knew before he spoke. It clicked inside me when I opened the door. (For years opening that door scared the life out of me. I hated it; it terrified me. We had this screeching bell like an alarm that shook the walls when anyone rang it. It lifted me off the floor, the kids started bawling; it was fuckin' dreadful. You were caught, snared, caught in the act. You looked around to hide whatever you'd been caught with, things that Charlo had left in the hall, things he'd robbed and left there. He changed the bell, after I chewed his ear and nearly wet myself five or six times a day. Nicola, my oldest, wouldn't come round the back to get into the house. She wanted to come through the front door; it was more grown up. She rang the bell ten times a minute.</p>
<p>--Forgot me jacket.</p>
<p>--Forgot me money.</p>
<p>--Don't like these jeans on me.</p>
<p>I hit her--she was thirteen, or twelve, much too old to be smacked--the hundredth time she rang the bell one Saturday morning. I hit her the way a woman would hit another woman, smack in the face. I was a bit drunk, I have to adrnit. I regretted it, tried to stop my hand after it had smashed her cheek and come back. She held her hand up to her cheek. It was red where I'd got it. She was stunned; she hadn't noticed me getting more annoyed. They never do at that age--at any age. I was sorry for her but she'd deserved it. I was sorry I was drunk, ashamed, angry; I usually made sure that no one noticed. I couldn't cope; it was only a stupid bell. She said she hated me, slammed the door and ran off. I let her away with it. The new bell was a nice bing-bong one but it made no difference. I still died a bit whenever someone rang it. The Guards looking for Charlo, teachers looking for John Paul, men looking for money. It's hard to hide in a house full of kids, to pretend there's no one there. Bing-bong. Only bad news came through that door; my sister, my daddy, John Paul, Charlo. Bing- bong.) It clicked inside me when I opened the door and saw the Guard. It was his face that told me before I was ready to know it. He wasn't looking for Charlo; it wasn't the usual. He was scared and there was something he had to tell me. I felt sorry for the poor young fella, sent in to do the dirty work. The other wasters were out in the car, too lazy and cute to come in and tell me themselves. I asked him in for a cup of tea. He sat in the kitchen with his hat still on him. He told me all about his family. </p>

<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
His ancestors may have owned and mistreated slaves in the Mississippi Delta,
but Will Savage was working off his historical debt through a lover affair with
black soul music. He arrived grooving at his New England prep school in the
mid-sixties, to the awed fascination of Patrick, his Irish-Catholic room-mate
from a dreary New England mill town. Theirs was an unusual friendship that
was to last for decades.
<p>While Patrick aspired to all that the Ivy League and convention had to offer, Will defied his white Southern family's wishes, especially his father's, in marrying a beautiful black woman. He became a dedicated scout and promoter of Soul, a pioneer of haute hippiedom and eventually an underground legend. From a mid-life point of affluent Park Avenue domesticity, the lawyer Patrick would look back on his intense friendship with Will and the single most daring and unpredictable choice he allowed himself in his studied course of upward mobility.</p>
<p>The Last of the Savages is a dazzling novel about friendship, music and race relations, and about family for better of worse. It embraces an interracial love story, an overview of American social changes circa 1965 to 1995 and the portrait of an abiding male intimacy that is funny, profound and unforgettable. </p>

<h2>D<font size=-1>ANGEROUS</font> L<font size=-1>OVE</font>.<br></h2>

<i>Phoenix House; 325 pages; &#163;15.99.</i><br>
</p><br>
<a href="7bt181.html">Biography</a>
<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
Dangerous Love, an epic of daily life, is Ben Okri's most accessible and most
disarming novel. In simple terms it is a love story, set against the background
of seventies' Nigeria in the aftermath of the civil war, among young people
forever marked by the experiences and memories of a people torn apart. As the
title implies, it is a story of doomed love, of two 'star-crossed' lovers, separated
not by their families, but by the very circumstances of their lives.
<p>It is also a story of a dangerous time, of a nation painfully finding its identity in a post-colonial age, saturated with corruption and with selfdoubt, struggling to reconcile the old ways with the new. And yet through it all runs a strange spirit of hope, for it is also a celebration of ordinary lives lived under impossible conditions. Somehow, in the midst of helplessness and decay, love can still flourish and flower.</p>
<p>Full of the sound and smell of Africa, Dangerous Love is Ben Okri's most personal and most political work and it is without doubt one of his most beautiful. </p>

Anne Tyler or John Irving - yet utterly unique.
<p>George Mahoney is a refrigerator designer wedded to facts and the physical world, with more than a passing interest in dinosaurs. Niagara Spense, his new colleague, spends her spare time seeking electrical evidence of life beyond the grave - via an old valve wireless. Niagara is six foot tall, with cloth-brown hair, a hearing aid, and glasses thicker than George's own. George cannot stop thinking about her, despite his solid marriage, pretty wife and two children.</p>
<p>George's behaviour becomes unpredictable. He lunches out, wears different clothes - and contemplates adultery. His wife Judy, a trim and dynamic real estate agent, picks up some of the signals but fortunately for George she's too busy worrying about their twelve-year-old son, Harris, who may be a genius or just a troublesome child with a weight problem. Harris plots the science project which he hopes will get him out of going to 'fat' camp, while Niagara, like a force of nature, turns George's world upside down.</p>
<p>Full of surprises, witty and compelling, The Frequency of Souls tells a wickedly original story which traces the mysterious sparks and enduring currents of love. </p>

'My name is Paula Spencer. I am thirty-nine years old. It was my birthday last
week. I was married for eighteen years. My husband died last year... He was
shot by the Guards. He left me a year before that. I threw him out. His name
was Charles Spencer; everyone called him Charlo.'
<p>Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, Roddy Doyle's last novel, won the 1993 Booker Prize and went on to become a phenomenal international bestseller. The Woman Who Walked Into Doors is his finest achievement to date, the heart-rending story of a woman struggling to reclaim her dignity after a violent, abusive marriage and a worsening drink problem. Paula Spencer recalls her contented childhood, the audacity she learned as a teenager, the exhilaration of her romance with Charlo, and the marriage to him that left her poweriess. Capturing both her vulnerability and her strength, Doyle gives Paula a voice that is real and unforgettable.</p>
<p>Lean and sexy, funny and poignant, The Woman Who Walked Into Doors shows, yet again, that Roddy Doyle has an unparalleled gift for transforming ordinary life into great literature. </p>

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"I know a fine way to treat a Steinway," goes Irving Berlin's song "I Love a Piano." By 1915 Berlin didn't need to explain the word Steinway: it had been the preeminent American piano for more than fifty years. After 1860 most pianos were copies of Steinways. Chickering, Weber, Mason &amp; Hamlin, all came and went; Steinway stayed at the top. Steinway &amp; Sons is about the family that manufactured and marketed that instrument.
</p><p>Starting in 1853, the Steinways saw their piano company through the strains of competition, strikes, and temperamental artists, as well as depressions and wars. Their saga extends from the factory bench to the showroom floor to the concert stage and international trade fairs.
</p><p>The Steinway story began in Germany in 1835 and went on to span capitalism in America from the days when a weekly wage was $5 to the days when $5 was an hourly wage. The Steinways slogged through the recessions of the 1850s, amassed huge fortunes in the 1880s, were devastated by the financial slump in the late 1890s, recovered with the rest of American business by the turn of the century, and accumulated great wealth before the radio, the phonograph, the automobile, and the Great Depression all but wiped them out. They limped along for the next twenty years and in the 1960s again began to prosper. But when Yamaha captured the world's piano market in the early 1970s, Steinway &amp; Sons' then president, Henry Z. Steinway, decided to sell the company to CBS.
</p><p>What is astounding is how the Steinways maintained this family business for so long, while all around them privately owned businesses were consolidating into larger stock companies. Few family-owned and operated businesses have lasted long enough to pass to a new generation, yet Steinway persisted under six different family members spanning five generations. This longevity was in large part achieved by having a partnership of an artist and a businessman at the helm. That mix of craft and commerce at the tiller was crucial in establishing the standards and style of Steinway &amp; Sons. Based on a cultural icon, it was not the type of enterprise that could be run by just a merchant or just a maestro. The family was unusually fortunate in having the right mix of skills in generation after generation but ran into trouble when half the mix was missing.
</p><p>In the 1930s and 1940s responsibility fell solely to an artist with no business sense, who lived more in Steinway's golden past than in its dreadful present. Theodore E. Steinway, grandson of the founder, was forced into the job of president against his will and found himself alone at the top. It was the first time in Steinway's history that the president didn't have a partner. Heinrich Steinway, founder of the company, could not have managed the business without his sons; when William emerged as top man, he called his brother Theodor back from Germany to work with him; after William died, the new president, Charles, consulted daily with his brother Frederick; and when Frederick took over, he had his older cousin Henry Ziegler at his side. But during the Depression and World War II, Theodore had no such support. His older brother Billie was more skilled at making friends and spending money than managing a business, and all Theodore's male cousins and nephews - women were not considered eligible as business partners - were too young. As a result, he made mistakes. He ignored the new, small upright piano market in the 1930s and wasn't astute enough to make money on military contracts during World War II. Lack of collaboration remained a problem into the 1950s and 1960s when his son Henry, who was not an artist but a businessman, ruled the company, again without that other half.
</p><p>Another reason for Steinway's unusual longevity as a family business in my view is that only twice did a son succeed his father. The presidency usually passed to a talented nephew, brother, or cousin. When the boss died, his eldest son was typically either too young or too incompetent to take over. This meant that the common family business predicament of sons succeeding talented, powerful fathers was circumvented.
</p><p>But, more than anything, Steinway's resilience was based on the quality of its piano, whose superiority was such that the flow of piano innovations in the late nineteenth century was from New York to Europe. At a time when America was still viewed as a frontier society, better at manufacturing plows than pianos, it was thought, Europeans were shocked to find Steinway &amp; Sons, an American manufacturer, making one of the finest pianos in the world. <br>

</p><p>The Steinway - once called the "instrument of the immortals" - is more than the preeminent American piano. It is also a symbol of Old World craftsmanship combined with American capitalism, of technological innovation, and of remarkable family management. This authoritative and entertaining book tells the story of the Steinway piano company and the people behind it.
</p><p>The first book based on the rich archive of Steinway business and family papers at LaGuardia Community College in NewYork, as well as on interviews with family members and company employees in the United States, Germany, and England, Steinway &amp; Sons describes the making and marketing of an American cultural icon. Founded in New York in 1853 by a German immigrant, the Steinway company quickly rose to prominence on the strength of the distinctive "Steinway sound." For five generations Steinways steered their company in the face of vigorous domestic and foreign competition, bitter labor disputes, temperamental musicians, a fluctuating economy, and wars. Members of the Gilded Age elite, the family also contended with adultery, alcoholism, emotional depression, and long court battles over money. Lieberman discusses the company town the Steinways built in Queens in the 1870s to "escape the machinations of the anarchists and socialists" in the city; the decision to manufacture in both NewYork and Hamburg, which led to Steinway factories supplying both sides in World War II; the improvements in piano technology that made Steinway the envy of other piano makers; the company's creative marketing techniques, such as booking celebreated European pianists into American concert halls; the competition from the Japanese-owned Yamaha company; and the sale of the financially troubled company to CBS in 1972. Weaving together themes from social, music, business, labor, and immigrant history; and lavishly illustrated with pictures from the Steinway archives, Steinway &amp; Sons is a rich narrative that casts new light on American cultural history and on a unique family enterprise. <br>

<p><b>Making pianos</b></p>
<h2>Wrong tone</h2><ul><li><a href="3ex21.html">S<font size=-1>TEINWAY</font> &amp; S<font size=-1>ONS</font></a>&nbsp; By Richard Lieberman.<br>
</ul>

<p>HOW distressing it was for snooty Europeans to find that the best pianos on display at the Paris Exposition in 1867 were made in America. New-world businessmen had set about perfecting the instrument with a modern technical flair completely absent in Europe and they marketed it as roguishly as Jefferson Brick, Lafayette Kettle or any of Dickens's other unscrupulous Americans. Not that anyone in America seemed to mind. The wealthy American public was only too eager to buy the 19th-century equivalent of a station wagon and park it prominently in the parlour window. Calvin Coolidge, America's 29th president, was later to say that he never imagined "a model New England home without a family bible on the table and the piano in the corner".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among American piano-makers none stands out like Steinway, the firm which virtually put the "grand" into "grand piano". The first of the line, Heinrich Steinweg, was an instrument-maker from Brunswick in Germany whose lone bugle call was supposed to have rallied the troops when Bl&uuml;cher and Wellington marched on Napoleon at Waterloo. Arriving in America aged 53 in 1850, Heinrich set up the family firm and anglicised his name.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Heinrich was a skilled craftsman, but the family's technical genius was Henry, one of his sons who was to die of tuberculosis in 1865 aged only 34. Within a few years, through a mixture of judicious borrowing and outright invention, Henry had sorted out how a piano should be strung, how to match a resonant soundboard with a metal frame, and how to make an action that was more responsive to the pianist's fingers. At the Vienna exhibition 16 years after Paris, more than two-thirds of the pianos on show had the "Steinway system".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Steinway did not rely on quality alone to sell pianos. Competition judges, performers and journalists were all bought off. At its most innocent, the understanding involved nothing more than an endorsement from the artist in exchange for the use of Steinways wherever needed. For Paderewski, Rubinstein, Horowitz and other star pianists, the company organised tours, covering all costs and guaranteeing the pianists a generous income. In extreme cases, such as the centennial exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, the company bribed the judges to try to ensure that its pianos eclipsed the competition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By the end of the 19th century, Steinway had a hold on the market and the first years of the 20th brought the family incredible wealth. Until the 1970s, if you wanted the best piano, you had a Steinway, just as surely as your chauffeur drove you about in a Rolls-Royce. But after the Depression, even if the pianos never failed, the Steinways' business acumen too often did.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This was partly because the Steinways, always tough and paternalistic, failed to adjust to an age when unions held more power. This mattered little while prosperity lasted. But in harder times, the family managers seemed stuck in their towers of ivory. Two world wars did not help. And not only because it distracted loyal citizens from buying pianos. During the second world war, Steinway, which tried in desperation to make a living building coffins, found itself suspected of being Nazi in America and Jewish in Germany.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the real blame lies with the family's poor strategic judgment and its dangerously complacent overvaluation of the Steinway tradition. It was a blunder not to grasp the popular appeal of the humble upright until too late. Even when Steinway's "pianinos" were introduced in 1937, they were costly to make and unremarkable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The family bungled also the restructuring of its factories, concentrating its American production on an old family site in the New York borough of Queens instead of building a modern factory which would have brought down costs and allowed for increased capacity. As a result, when demand for pianos at last picked up in the 1960s the company achieved an unenviable double: not only was there a backlog of unfilled orders, but margins were low. The end of Steinway began in the late 1960s when the firm failed to respond to the cheap, reliable pianos being made by Yamaha, first in Japan and later America. In the absence of radical measures, quality declined and the firm sought tariff protection from the Nixon administration. When that failed, Steinway in 1972 sold out to the <font size=-1>CBS</font> television network.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is something familiar here. Innovation, dominance, labour unrest, complacency, uncompetitiveness and Japanese brilliance were later to cripple cars, steel and other American industries. Yet the comparison is not examined in this book. Indeed, nowhere does the author really place the Steinways in America's corporate history.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Were the story told more compellingly this might not matter. But Mr Lieberman leaves too many loose ends. Drunkards, unfaithful spouses and family misfits appear intriguingly only to disappear without trace. "Like the keys on a piano, this book was played upon by many people," he writes in a preface. The result sadly lacks the rich tones of a Steinway.

<p><b>Sociobiology</b></p>
<h2>Gene's-eye view</h2><ul> <li><a href="7ex182.html">N<font size=-1>ARROW</font> R<font size=-1>OADS</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> G<font size=-1>ENE</font> L<font size=-1>AND</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By W.D. Hamilton. <br>
</ul>

<p>ON A spring afternoon at the Berlin zoo in 1989, a small crowd was gathered in front of the turkey enclosure. For there, just in front of the cage, a tall man with a large head, craggy features and a shock of white hair was flapping his arms, tapping his feet, and emitting "gobble gobble" noises: he was dancing a turkey mating dance. And the turkeys were joining in.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Few in the crowd would have known that they were looking at W. D. ("Bill") Hamilton, one of the greatest evolutionary biologists since Darwin. Publishing infrequently (the curriculum vitae that he sends out has a list of publications that is a single page) and almost always alone, he rarely had his work accepted by <i>Nature</i> or <i>Science</i>. But he revolutionised biology.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a postgraduate at the University of London, he worried about altruism: when, if ever, should an organism put itself at risk for another? His answer, published in two parts in the <i>Journal of Theoretical Biology</i> in 1964, inadvertently founded the field of research now known as sociobiology. Roughly, his idea is that if apparently altruistic behaviour carries a big cost--such as death or sterility--then it will happen only if the two organisms in question are near relatives. Such organisms have a high proportion of genes in common. If gene-spreading is the aim, helping to rear a sister's children can sometimes be more effective than having children of your own.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This explanation of altruism has surprising power. It explains, for instance, why females in so many species of ant and bee work tirelessly to bring up their sisters instead of having nests of their own: because of a peculiar genetic system, the sisters share more genes with each other than they would with any of their children. Nor was it just the treatment of altruism that was radical. The gene's-eye view of the world has taken on even more importance now it seems that different genes within an organism can have different "interests" and that these in turn can affect evolution.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From the questions of why babies die and of why creatures get old (and why some of them have a menopause--humans are not alone in this, some aphids have one too), to whether animals are ever spiteful, to the advantages of being in the middle of a herd, to the sex lives of the bugs that live on dead wood, Bill Hamilton turned to whatever he found interesting.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He is revered by students and often envied by colleagues, and everyone who has met him has a story to tell. (A favourite: his youngest daughter was once heard to exclaim, "Hey, Dad, look. There's a really interesting weevil in the sugar bowl!"). But perhaps the best person to tell such tales is Mr Hamilton--and in this volume he does so. Each of 15 papers is preceded by a specially written introduction. In these short essays, he tells anecdotes, muses on scientific questions and ponders what, if anything, his work can reveal about people.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Erudite, funny, sometimes moving, occasionally strange, he tells of himself as a young man so lonely that late at night he worked out algebra on the benches of Waterloo station, of getting his first job as a lecturer because the only other applicant turned the offer down, of dressing up in a baker's costume to acquire a colony of rare ants from a biscuit factory, of plotting with a colleague to trick<i> Nature</i> into accepting their papers, of watching and quietly cheering as two stag beetles fought on (but not over) his boots. Readers with little knowledge of biology may find this collection difficult in places--but it will entertain and, perhaps, inspire.

SHOULDERS OF GIANTS
The Evolution of Altruistic Behaviour
<p><ul> There be many shapes of mystery. And many things God makes to be, Past hope and fear. And the end men looked for cometh not, And a path is there where no man sought, So hath it fallen here. EURIPIDES</ul></p>
<p>UP to 1963 my only 'published' writings were a story written when a child and filling a half page in Sevenoaks Preparatory School Magazine and a review of a popular book on dolphins for a New Zealand literary journal. The review was done when I was already a graduate student in London. The reasons why the editor of Landfall requested a review from a biology student so far away are, probably, first, that he did not know other biologists, second, I was his godson, and, third, that he knew from my rare letters that I was working on something to do with social behaviour. Even then the lives of dolphins had a reputation for being unusual and complex. My ideas about them, as about the book, were very lightweight and my review does not merit inclusion in this book. However, the topic of dolphins and my godfather's 'nepotism' in sending me the task are relevant in an odd way to the paper that follows. They hint at matters beyond biology, even a line of escape from the theory my paper describes. Dolphins indeed come near to defying Darwin himself by an act of a kind of which he said that, if a single instance could be convincingly documented, it would annihilate his theory completely. It seems that sometimes a dolphin may push a drowning human--a mammal from a world almost as alien to theirs as a world of Martians would be to ours--to the sea surface where the human can breathe or, perhaps still more inexplicably appropriate, may push or carry him or her towards the shore, as first recorded in numerous Greek legends, such as the one concerning Arion.</p>
<p>Just as Homo, the taxon of humans, is unrelated to Tursiops truncatus--that of the seemingly most foolishly anthropophilic of the dolphins--so I, within Homo, was unrelated to my New Zealand godfather Charles Brasch, who gave me my first chance of a publication. Yet my parents named him my godfather and he acknowledged me as his godson: I thus received a kind of pseudonepotism from him--and in fact I received this on many occasions besides the one mentioned. Was this just a stupid mistake on his part, as biologists are inclined to interpret the dolphin's act to be? If not, what aberration or extension of the normal run of nepotism is here? That 30 years before Charles Brasch had hoped to marry my mother but since that time had- stayed single and, living as he did in New Zealand, had hardly a hope even to see her, certainly cannot, via biology, help to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Doubtless I was seeing these problems from a somewhat different perspective when I was twenty-seven, but one thing has not changed--this is my dislike for the idea that my own behaviour or behaviour of my friends illustrates my own theory of sociality or any other. I like always to imagine that I and we are above all that, subject to far more mysterious laws. In this prejudice, however, I seem, rather sadly, to have been losing more ground than I gain. The theory that I outline in the paper has turned out very successful. It certainly illuminates not only animal behaviour but, to some extent as yet unknown but now being actively researched, human behaviour as well. Clearly, the fact that I devoted several papers to expanding its implications and had proceeded initially unaware of most of the tentative approaches of various Neodarwinian forerunners means I was more hopeful of the idea's explanatory power than had been the forerunners--the three great pioneers of modern evolution theory, J. B. S. Haldane, R.A. Fisher, and Sewall Wright, who, as shown in the references in the paper, gave to altruism at most a few lines. </p>

Why is 'blood thicker than water'? Are we--are out genes--violent or pacific?
What is the best sex ration? Why do we grow old and die? Over what to our
chromosones quarrel?
<p>Such questioning, born from a love of nature, has motivated the life work of W.D. Hamilton, widely acknowledge as the most important theoretical biologist of the 20th century. His papers continue to exert an enormous influence and they are now being republished for the first time. Each one is introduced by an autobiographical essay written for this collection.</p>
<p>This first volume contains all of Hamilton's publications prior to 1981, a set especially relevant to social behaviour, kinship theory, sociobiology and the notion of 'selfish genes'. It includes several of the most read and famous papers of modern biology. A forthcoming volume will be devoted to the second half of Hamilton's life's work, on sex and sexual selection.</p>
<p>Narrow Roads of Gene Land will be welcomed by professionals, graduate students and undergraduates from a wide range of disciplines, from evolution, population genetics, animal behaviour and evolutionary ecology, to genetics, social anthropology, sociology, psychiatry, psychology, philosophy, economics and the history of science. But the readership will by no means be restricted to an academic one. The introductions are wholly accessible to non-specialists and they will fascinate and entertain any general reader with an interest in science, providing them with a unique insight into what the life and the enthusiasms of a modern scientist/philosopher are like. </p>

When the twentieth century opened, Jerusalem was an outpost of the Ottoman
Empire, a provincial town ruled from Constantinople. As the century closes it is
a major city, the capital of an independent nation, and still a vital centre of
religious worship for three world religions.
<p>The story of those hundred years, from the twilight of Turkish rule to the advent of the twenty-first century as Jewish Jerusalem celebrates the 3000th anniversary of its foundation - is fascinating, often tragic, always gripping, and vital to our understanding of the Middle East.</p>
<p>Martin Gilbert's earlier volume, Jerusalem: Rebirth of a City, was an acclaimed history of the city in the nineteenth century. This new study comprises a vivid and authoritative history of the crucial years which followed. Rooted in contemporary sources and scholarship, it springs from his intimate knowledge of the city and its people.</p>
<p>Here is Jerusalem's dramatic modern story, including the city's liberation from the Turks by the British army in 1917, the Balfour Declaration with its promise of a Jewish National Home, the years of the British Mandate - when the rapid growth of a modern city was frequently disrupted by violence - the Second World War, the British withdrawal on the eve of the battle for Jerusalem in 1948, the creation of the State of Israel, the division of the city into two disparate parts, the Six Day War of 1967, the city's reunification, the rebuilding that followed, the Intifada years, and, finally, the uneasy yet hopeful agreements of the nineties between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Lucid, readable, essential history, Jerusalem in the Twentieth Century covers every facet of Jerusalem's life - political, cultural, architectural, intellectual, religious and social. The conflicts, traumas, aspirations and achievements of an often disputed yet always vibrant city, and of a whole region, are reflected in its pages. </p>

<p><b>Cities: Jerusalem</b></p>
<h2>An obstacle in the path of peace</h2><ul> <li><a href="7ex188.html">J<font size=-1>ERUSALEM</font> <font size=-1>IN</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> T<font size=-1>WENTIETH</font> C<font size=-1>ENTURY</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Martin Gilbert. <br>
</ul>

<p>THE end of the second world war, writes Martin Gilbert, "left Jerusalem stranded like a beached whale on the shores of conflict". Not, to be sure, how most people see the golden city. Yet, now more than ever, Jerusalem is a large immobile obstacle in the path of a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli who understands the Palestinians and who was once a deputy mayor of the city, was putting it correctly when he wrote: "There is no other place where one feels the tragedy of two nations fighting for their homeland more than in Jerusalem."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sir Martin is a brilliant chronicler of Jerusalem's conflicts, at least in the first half of the 20th century; his feeling for its tragedy is less in evidence. Having described the 19th-century city in an earlier book, he now carries the story on to the last days of the Ottoman empire and the British mandate, through the bloody rush of events that led to Israel's birth and the city's division and reunification, down to its less-than-certain present. He is a master at bringing complicated history briskly alive through anecdote and quotation, plundering newspapers and letters for contemporary viewpoints.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He packs in the main events but lightens the narrative with telling detail. Here, for instance, is an old man commenting on the execution of an Arab nationalist by the Turks: "He was a good man, greatly respected; therefore we all assembled to see him hang." A Christian Arab writes to the military governor, "I do beseech Your Excellency to grant my request, for the sake of J. Christ, Esq; a gentleman whom Your Honour so closely resembles."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1917 the mayor and elders of the city, ceremonially bearing its keys, sought out a British conqueror to hand them to but found only "two wandering and bewildered cockney sergeants from Camden Town". This anecdote foreshadows another, 30 years later and not told in this work, of how a British high commissioner, on Britain's way out, was asked to whom he would give the keys and replied that he would probably leave them under the mat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The struggle for those keys, or at least the side-door key to East Jerusalem, is the city's continuing story--and Martin Gilbert narrates it scrupulously. His sympathies, however, are openly with Israel. In the countless battles, the terrorism and the counter-terrorism, the dead are numbered but the Jewish dead are more likely to spring from the statistics with little labels making each death a sadness. He accepts Israel's territorial need to build an unbroken circle of new Jewish suburbs around Arab Jerusalem. And he gives the Israelis, in particular Teddy Kollek, who was Jerusalem's mayor for 28 years, too much credit for making life better for the city's Arab residents. Mr Kollek, a great publicist, may have had good intentions but they did not work out in practice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although this history ends with the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's murdered prime minister, and the outburst of Islamist suicide-bombings, the author remains hopeful. The city of Jerusalem, he writes, can feel pride in "a century of creativity and satisfaction, exuberant life, determination, civic achievement". Rabin is quoted as saying, shortly before his death: "Jerusalem has a thousand faces, and each one of us has his own Jerusalem." So be it. Sir Martin depicts one Jerusalem; the city has other faces, too.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Awakenings,
1900-1909
<p>A young Christian Arab, Mousa Kaleel, who lived in the town of Ramallah, fifteen miles north of Jerusalem, made his first visit there, by horse-drawn carriage, at the turn of the century. 'We saw no smoke coming out of tall chimneys, as we do on approaching cities in Western countries,' he later recalled. 'We saw spires of churches, bell-towers, minarets and square houses; we saw the wall girdling the city proper. We saw everything which reminded us of chivalry, religion and age, awakening the poetic in our natures.'</p>
<p>Yet the streets of Jerusalem were, Kaleel wrote, 'mean and narrow, and the private buildings are not imposing, but their humble appearance is effectively offset by the grandeur of the numerous churches, mosques, minarets, and public buildings'. From the minarets came the muezzins' call to the Muslim faithful: 'God is greatest; there is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is His messenger. Come to prayeL Come to salvation.'</p>
<p>On this first visit Kaleel also saw, to the north of the Old City, 'the "new Jerusalem", about twice as large as the city proper, and decidedly more modern looking. Here dwell the Jews who are assisted to return to the city by the Zionist Society. As a result of this immigration, the population has tripled in the last twenty years.'</p>
<p>Jerusalem, which had mouldered for so many centuries, had become a thriving city by 1900. No month passed without a new public building being started. On 7 October 1900 the first stone was laid for one of the most striking of all the city's buildings, the Church of the Dormition, on Mount Zion. This was a project of the Lazarist Fathers, favoured and supported by the German Kaiser, Wilhelm II, who had visited Jerusalem two years earlier, and wanted the Imperial German style and presence to be an important feature of the city. Within a year a second substantial German building was under construction, the St Paul's Hospice, outside the Damascus Gate. Another builder in Jerusalem in the first decade of the century was the Ethiopian Empress Taitu, who commissioned a substantial church just off the Street of the Consuls, and built nearby an elegant twostorey residential building for Ethiopian residents and visitors.</p>
<p>The narrow-gauge, single-track railway from the coast, opened eight years before the turn of the century, brought a steady stream of visitors, most numerous being Russian and Greek Orthodox pilgrims, and Jewish settlers. The train travelled at the slowest of paces. In 19O1 a Western missionary in the city, E. A. ReynoldsBall, wrote: 'It requires only an ordinary amount of activity to jump out and pick the flowers along the line, and rejoin the train as it laboriously pants up the steep ascent - a feat I myself have occasionally performed.'</p>
<p>Even less reliable than the railway was Jerusalem's water supply. At the turn of the century the city's population depended on rainwater collected in cisterns. Although most houses had cisterns, these were almost always extremely old, and often unsanitary. Water was also carried into the city in large goatskin bladders by itinerant watersellers, who drew it from the biblical Gihon Spring in the Kidron Valley. In 1901 the Turkish authorities laid an iron pipe from Solomon's Pools south of Bethlehem more than twelve miles across the hills to Jerusalem, converting an ancient tunnel under the Hill of Evil Counsel into a reservoir. But this water supply was dependent upon gravity flow over a terrain that, despite the Turks' best efforts, had upward as well as downward sections, and the quantity of water reaching the city through this pipe, never much more than about 20,000 gallons a day, decreased after a few years and was not improved. </p>

A remarkable firsthand account, by turns hilarious, heartbreaking and thrilling,
of a small band of Amazonian warriors and their battle to preserve their way of
life from the scourge of civilization.
<p>Joe Kane, author of the bestselling Running the Amazon, returns to the river to search for the Huaorani, a nation of 1,300 nomadic warriors so remote that their language is unrelated to any other on earth; so fierce that for millenia they have turned all comers away from their land, a territory in the middle of the Ecuadorian Amazo the size of Wales.</p>
<p>But now, the Huaorani are besieged by hell-bent oil companies, dogged missionaries, zealous indigenous bureaucrats and strarry-eyed environmentalists intent on helping them 'better' themselves.</p>
<p>Kane's account of the efforts of the Huaorani to vault from Stone Age to Petroleum Age, to move faster than the forces of change, brings us face-to-face with the nature of our built-in need to develop the world willy-nilly and our inability to acknowledge to basic purpose of development. </p>

<h2>A right to a past</h2><ul> <li><a href="8ex225.html">S<font size=-1>AVAGES</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Joe Kane. <br>
</ul>


<p>IF YOU belong to a remote tribe living on top of millions of barrels of oil in a heavily-indebted country, you might as well give up and get ready to move. The Huaorani people of central Ecuador, 1,400 semi-nomadic semi-warriors, refused. "Savages" is an account of how they tried and failed--it seems inevitably--to hang on to their lands and their way of life.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The savages intended in the title are not the Huaorani, despite their penchant for naked spear-wars. Their lives have been so remote from the rest of the world for so long that their language has no terms for counting: "enough" and "not enough" are sufficient. Until recently, the typical Huao would meet just 70 or 80 people in the course of a lifetime.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Joe Kane is not dewy-eyed about the Huaorani, however. Hunting and gathering, he learns the hard way, is no picnic. The Huaorani live short and often sick lives in which hunger and violence are strong features. And when his Huao friends visit him in Quito, they are the houseguests from hell. That clash of cultures aside, they come off rather well. It is hard not to like a fellow like Moi, who swore never to return to Los Angeles after a trip to drum up support exposed him to his first vegetarians: "Barbarians," he shuddered.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Huaorani seem afraid at the prospect of companies tapping the riches beneath their soil. To understand why, Mr Kane visits Lago Agrio, where the Cofan Indians live. Their village, too, had the misfortune to be seeping with oil. During its exploitation, there were six major spills, which the companies cleaned up by hiring workers to scoop up the filth with their hands and then put it into hundreds of open waste pits. For this, they were paid a dollar a day, with most of that then taken back to pay for rent and incidentals. Promises not to exploit a wildlife reserve were broken, and no one tried hard to limit land-seizures in this crowded country. The result for the Cofan Indians: "They are a listless and defeated bunch."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though depressed, Mr Kane is not a Luddite. He understands that pumping oil is what oil companies do. But he is persuasive that it could be done less brutally. The companies themselves agree, to a point. One firm did not want to go into the Oriente, as the region is known, until it had the public approval of a respected environmental group. A noble thought, and one that betrays a different sensibility from that of 19th-century buccaneers on the economic frontier. Unfortunately, this led mostly to political in-fighting of the most unseemly kind, as the oil companies sought out tame tribal folks and various western environmental groups waded in.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kane saves a special contempt for Robert Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defence Council, who jetted to Ecuador for five days, then cut a deal with the oil company he thought would do the least damage. No doubt his heart was in the right place, but these "environmental imperialists", as an Ecuadorean memorably terms them, butted in to make bad decisions for people who were able to articulate their own desires perfectly well.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kane has the intellectual courage--too rare among rainforest activists--to ask: Do the Huaorani have the right "to be protected from change"? The answer he seems to come to is no--but they should be given a large say in how they make the adjustment. A group of Cofan Indians who are running eco-tours in the rainforest is an example of what he has in mind.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The larger question is whether today's powers-that-be are willing and able to accommodate themselves to this outlook. In the Huaorani case, they were not. There was much sound (from the government and oil companies) and much fury (from the Huaorani and their allies) but never a meeting of minds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Joe Kane has done something unusual: he catches a moment--the end of a small, ancient civilisation--in a kind of amber. The Huaorani will never be the same. But it is some compensation at least that their memory has been recorded for outsiders in the pages of this excellent book.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
THE PORT OF Coca sits on the north bank of the broad, brown Napo River, in
the very heart of the Oriente, which may well be the richest biotic zone on the
planet. But as I entered town for the first time, bouncing on the back of a
flatbed pickup, what I smelled most strongly was raw petroleum. Coca is ringed
by oil wells, and every few days its dirt streets are hosed down with waste
crude. Oily mud splashed across my clothes and pack. Down along the
roadside, oil had spattered chickens, mules, pigs, barefoot schoolchildren, and
peasants slip-sliding along on rickety bicycles. It even slopped up onto the
spanking-new four-wheel-drive trucks that now and thencame- blasting down
the road at breakneck speed.
<p>Some of these trucks bore the insignia of the state oil company, Petroecuador, but most of them did the work of American companies: Texaco, Occidental Petroleum, ARCO, Unocal, Conoco, Maxus Energy, Mobil, Oryx Energy, all of which have, or had, oil developments in the otherwise sylvan wilderness that surrounds Coca for hundreds of square miles. Indeed, though Coca was small, with a permanent population of less than five thousand, there were always Americans around. The truck dropped me outside a restaurant called El Buho. The menu featured such jungle fare as tapir, capybara, paca, venison, caiman, and peccary, but you could also get a cheeseburger and fries, which is what the four white men sitting across the room ordered, in English, in accents unmistakably southern. The Mission, Coca's only hot-water hotel, was booked solid with Occidental Petroleum executives in from the States, and at dawn the next day, when a squad of Ecuadorian soldiers jogged down the main street in earnest formation, what caught my attention in the sea of brown Latin skin were the blond hair and blue eyes of the man leading them: His uniform identified him as an officer in the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>If oil was the first thing you noticed in Coca, the second was the suggestion of Aucas, the people indigenous to the vast and mostly uncharted stretch of the Oriente that begins across the Napo and extends over a hundred miles south and east, to the Peruvian border. Trinket shops sold Auca blowguns and spears, tour guides promoted river trips to the Auca homeland to see "naked savages," and on the walls of the Hotel Auca, in the center of town, hung black-and-white photographs of Aucas dressed in, at most, bellybands and earrings, their short, powerfully muscled torsos painted and tattooed, their earlobes perforated and hugely distended. If you happened to mention that you were heading into Auca territory, you were likely to be told that the Aucas regularly killed travelers, other Indians, and their own people, and that they would not only kill you but eat your flesh. Without a doubt you would hear the story of a Capuchin missionary named Alejandro Labaca.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, Labaca, then the bishop of Coca, crossed the Napo and made the first sustained contact with several Auca bands living deep in the forest. The Aucas robbed him blind. (They survive mainly by hunting and by gathering forest crops, and they regarded his belongings much as they would ripe coconuts.) But Labaca kept returning, and over the years he came to feel comfortable with his new friends. Then, in 1984, an oil crew succeeded in killing Taga, the notoriously fierce leader of the Tagaeri, the most reclusive of the Auca clans. The other Tagaeri managed to escape deeper into the forest, but in 1987 an oil exploration team investigating the Auca territory by air spotted a clearing they believed to be the clan's new home. Labaca was worried that the company would track the Tagaeri down and kill them, and he asked permission to attempt friendly contact first. A helicopter crew dropped him in the clearing. It returned a few days later to find him pinned to the ground, spread-eagled, by seventeen palm-wood spears, each of them about ten feet long, which jutted like porcupine quills from his throat, chest, arms, and thighs. His corpse was punctured in eighty-nine places. </p>

A PROMISED MOON
<p>One summer night in 1980, I sat in a Manchester garden with Hanh, watching the moon rise up into a dark, clear sky. The air smelled of honeysuckle, and was warm enough for us to be wearing light cotton dresses. At the time, I was a teacher at a Reception Centre for Vietnamese refugees. Hanh was one of my students; she had also become my friend. She didn't usually talk much about her experiences, and bore her self-imposed exile with a quiet dignity. But the balmy night seemed to draw her out. In her smattering of English, she told me of how she, her husband Tuyen and their small children had escaped by boat from Vietnam. There were some grisly details: weeks at sea, food and water running out, attacks by pirates, old people dying and their bodies being put overboard. Then she spoke of all the relatives she had left behind in Vietnam, and who she would never see again. We were both silent for a while, gazing at the moon. Hanh began to weep. I held her hand, knowing there was little other comfort to offer her.</p>
<p>'In Vietnam, moon very beautiful,' she said sadly. 'One day,' I told her, 'you'll go back there.'</p>
<p>'No,' she sighed. 'Never go back.'</p>
<p>'Then I'll go,' I joked, in an effort to cheer her, 'and bring back the moon for you.'</p>
<p>We laughed a little, then talked of other things, neither of us dreaming that I would in fact go to Vietnam, and see the moon rise there, fourteen years later.</p>
<p>Time passed. I moved to Canada, married Dag Goering, and began a new career as a writer. Hanh and Tuyen settled in Birmingham. Their lives were changing fast. Each time I visited them, they would have more acquisitions to show me: a television, a video, a car, a Walkman. Their children acquired strong Birmingham accents and began to forget their Vietnamese. But some things remained the same. Dotted around their small council house were shrines where joss sticks burned and offerings were left. Like most Vietnamese, Hanh and Tuyen were Buddhists, whose religion was underpinned by animistic beliefs. They told me about spirits who lived in rivers and the sea, in stones and in trees. One watched over things in their kitchen, another guarded the entire house. If placated with offerings, these spirits brought them good fortune; if not, they could wreak havoc in their lives. Hanh and Tuyen also worshipped their ancestors. In their front room was a shrine dedicated to the spirit of Tuyen's mother, where money and tidbits of her favourite food were left, so that she would be as comfortable in death as she had been in life. It is the men of Vietnamese families who tend to their ancestors, and Tuyen expressed concern to me that his Westernized sons might not look after him so well when he was in the afterlife. If they disregarded their duties, he explained, he would become a lost spirit, wandering around and causing trouble. In Vietnam, special altars and temples were built to appease these wandering spirits; in Birmingham, however, no such provisions were made, and his spirit would be destined unhappily to roam forever. </p>

There was an air of expectancy and excitement: everyone was waiting for the
moon. Heralded by a halo of soft light, it appeared, huge, yellow and majestic,
rising above the palm trees. 'Chi Hang' - Sister Moon - was greeted with cries
of delight, with offerings tossed into the water, with fire crackers and clapping.
<p>Three full moons rose over Vietnam as Maria Coffey and her husband Dag explored the country's spectacular coast from the great Mekong Delta in the south to Halong Bay in the north. Determined to see the 'real' Vietnam, they traveled aboard leaky fishing boats, in tiny sampans and coracles, on rickety bicycles and battered buses.</p>
<p>Straying far off the tourist routes, they were dogged by petty officials, hid in small boats to avoid arrest and encountered wandering spirits and snakes in bottles. Their tough, exhilarating journey carried them through a country in flux between doctrinaire socialism and a free-market economy, where ancient traditions persist alongside terrible memories of the 'American War', and where people survive with dignity and humour.</p>
<p>Maria Coffey chronicles this haphazard adventure in a frank, engaging and often hilarious style. She movingly portrays an unexpected encounter of the heart, and the forming of an emotional bond which will last for many moons to come. </p>

</i>



<p>VIETNAM is no longer just for the nose-pierced hard-core traveller; neither is it yet suitable for the blue-rinse set. Still, enough Vietnamese have enough English, and moxie, to enable reasonably intrepid visitors to get where they want to go with no more hassle than in any other poverty-stricken dictatorship.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So it is not surprising that travel writers are descending on the place. One of these is Christopher Hunt, a former financial writer for <i>The Economist</i> who went to Vietnam to research a novel and instead rode a Russian motorbike along as much of the Ho Chi Minh trail as he could find. He is a genial and unpretentious sort who does not pretend to Great Thoughts on things Vietnamese. But he is good company. For example, he gets to Hue, and realises he just does not give a damn that it is Vietnam's cultural capital. So he skips seeing the emperors' tombs, and buzzes off to make a date with a waitress. She stands him up. He moves on.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Hunt is also refreshingly free of guilt about the war--he was 12 when Saigon fell--and this spares the book the pointless agonising that too many writers on Vietnam seem compelled to affect. The war is obviously an important piece of the puzzle that is Vietnam, and the Ho Chi Minh trail is a relic of it, but Mr Hunt uses the trail as a way to get to today's Vietnam, not as a vein-opening pathway to an exquisite angst<i>. </i>The device works nicely. All kinds of rogues seem to find him, from gangster wannabes to pimps to the more pathetic kind of American Vietnam vet, and the result is an evocative, funny book that rings true. There are worse places to see Vietnam from than Mr Hunt's pillion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Travel books written by unfunny, miserable people, however, are a slog. Zo&#145; Schramm-Evans's falls into this category. She admits she did not know much about Vietnam, and several weeks there obviously did not help much. "The Lonely Planet Guide" seems to be her main reference source. And though Vietnam has 70m people, half of whom are practising their English at any given time, she meets few of them. The ones she does meet tend to be guides or drivers, and too often she ends up screaming at them--bad strategy in Asia, and rotten manners anywhere.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Maria Coffey is much better company in an account of a journey she and her husband Dag made via boat and bike along the Vietnamese coast. Before this sounds too worthy for words, it is not. They are not the kind of travellers who are not happy if they are comfortable; in fact, they bitch rather nicely about smelly buses, foul hotel rooms and grasping officials. They chose to go by boat because, well, Dag likes them, and Maria likes Dag, and they thought they would meet lots of locals. In the event, they did, including a boat handler whose favourite author is Nietzsche, a Vietnamese-American hustler, and two remarkable children.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Mr Hunt and Ms Coffey found, Vietnam is full of graceful, generous and charming people. But there is a dark side as well. Take the treatment of children born to Vietnamese mothers and American fathers. Such children were routinely maltreated and often expelled from their homes. When America decided in the 1980s to allow these Amerasians to come to America, Vietnam was happy to see them go. Their story is told by Thomas Bass. From being despised, Amerasians suddenly became the hottest of commodities: a free ticket to America. Many were sold to the highest bidder. With fraud so rampant, American officials became cynical, and deserving cases were shut out. In the end, 20,000 Amerasians and 60,000 purported family members came to America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a variety of reasons, Utica, a dilapidated industrial city in upstate New York, got a lot of them, and Mr Bass follows the Amerasian story there. There are some happy endings, but many more ambiguous ones. Some have formed gangs; some have gone on welfare. Others are doing better. Local industries see the Amerasians and their families as docile and hard-working and have been willing to hire them. Younger kids are adapting to school. But it is hard to see many of the Amerasians, whose average schooling lasted three years, ever realising the American dream. They are the final casualties of the American war, and a reminder that travelling away from home is the best way to gain a perspective on it.

GETTING THERE
<p>In the autumn of 1994, having just handed in the manuscript of my first book, I decided to take a journey long promised in my imagination, a journey to Vietnam. Because my final decision to head east was sudden and near to Christmas, all direct flights into Vietnam from London were full at the time I wanted to leave. Having telephoned dozens of travel agents, I finally acknowledged that my only option was to fly to Hong Kong, with a connecting flight back to Ho Chi Minh City four days later. This news was bad enough, but I then learnt that the only carrier with seats available was Aeroflot which, empirical evidence suggested, would invariably mean several fuel stops, a great deal of chicken and no film between London and the soon-to-be-Chinese colony. It did suggest a new itinerary, however, and I began to plan my return journey from Vietnam, traveling north and east through China and back to Hong Kong by land. So, my book and visa purchases included not only Vietnam but China too.</p>
<p>Attempting to counter some of my own assumptions about Vietnam, I read what I could in the time between deciding to leave and departure. Although hundreds of books have been written on Vietnam since 1965, very few have been about the country or the people. The focus of such books is war - from an almost exclusively US perspective. However, reading Michael Herr's Dispatches (the book which reputedly inspired the seminal Vietnam war film Apocalypse Now), followed immediately by Bau Nin's novel The Sorrow of War, was profoundly enlightening. Herr's book is a spectacular, journalistic tour-de-force which I could barely put down. Place names remembered from my childhood, like Da Nang and Khe San, echoed as I read into the early hours of the morning. Herr had been there, he'd seen it. His words and those of men like him had made the news I heard as a child. My reading was enhanced by the fact that I had recently met a character in Herr's book, photographer Tim Page, who had brought names like 'I Corps' and 'DMZ' (Demilitarized Zone) vividly to life for me at his home in Kent and had given me what were to be useful contacts in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Dispatches fascinated me, but it was only as I read The Sorrow of War that I wept. Nin is a veteran of the Ha Noi side, the winning side, but his expression of loss and failure is intense and sensitive in its continual questioning of the purpose of war and the ephemeral nature of victory. Nin was really there, unable to fly in and out of the war as Western journalists did, and that 'thereness' is in every line of his novel. I found The Sorrow of War unremittingly depressing, but it moved me in a way Herr's brilliant, controlled writing could not. I was shocked to discover how deep my own prejudices had been, how I had unconsciously retained those stories of 'goodies' and 'baddies' where inscrutable 'gooks', 'dinks' and 'slopes' were always bad, and tall, square- jawed and invariably white college boys good. The experiences of Nin's hero Kien in the 'Jungle of Screaming Souls' taught me that I should already have known that there is no occidental monopoly on emotion, on romanticism, on sentimentality, or on the expression of those things, though we in the West have occasionally tried to convince ourselves that there is. Kien's 'sorrow' became more real to me than the entire Vietnam oeuvre of Hollywood. It also made me more nervous. </p>

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Looking for the Mohawk Valley Resource Center for Refugees, I drive into
downtown Utica, New York, in the summer of 1990. I park my car and am
standing in front of the Florentine Pastry Shop, when I stop someone to ask for
directions.
<p>He is a tall young man with red hair. He wears blue jeans and walks with a streetwise prowl. His exposed teeth are all I get by way of an answer. I look into his broad beaming face and realize the young man doesn't speak a word of English.</p>
<p>I meet a whole crowd of Amerasians across the street. They are milling beside a storefront window that bears a hand-lettered sign announcing the location of the refugee center. The former Brescia's Furniture Store is an eighteen-thousand- square-foot windowless cave that functions as Utica's Ellis Island. Played out here is what it means to migrate from the old world to the new. In some ways the passage is quicker than it used to be. In others, slower. Instead of sailing into New York Harbor, refugees now touch down at night into Oneida County Airport. As soon as they step off the plane they become supplicants placed in the hands of social workers who dress and feed them.</p>
<p>The famous "six-second medical" at Ellis Island lasted only long enough for doctors to chalk on one's sleeve an E for suspected eye diseases, ht for heart problems, Pg for pregnancy, X for mental retardation, or X with a circle around it for insanity--all disqualifying conditions. The process today is longer, but no less intimidating. Arriving refugees submit to blood tests, TB tine tests, fecal exams, X-rays. They get three months of "services"--welfare, food stamps, clothing, counseling, a furnished apartment, "survival" English classes--and then they get a job.</p>
<p>About forty refugees a month arrive in Utica. These include Amerasians, their mothers and other family members, former Vietnamese reeducation camp prisoners, Byelorussian Pentecostals, and the odd Libyan, Eritrean, or Croatian Muslim. Founded by a Jew and staffed predominantly by Catholics, the Utica refugee center is affiliated with Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services. LIRS is one of the dozen voluntary agencies, or "volags," that resettle displaced persons in the United States under State Department contracts. </p>

The West has long had a fascination with Vietnam; and yet this fascination has
focused so much on the war that the reality of contemporary Vietnam and its
culture is all but obscured.
<p>In this thoughtful, informative and very personal account of a journey from Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta to Hanoi and Halong Bay, Zo&euml; Schramm- Evans delves behind the cliche-ridden images of Vietnam, to discover a country poised on the brink of the most remarkable social and economic change. On her journey she meets former Viet Cong fighters, students, journalists, civil servants, street children, prostitutes, entrepreneurs and, of course, fellow travelers.</p>
<p>Throughout her travels she observes with humour, and occasional despair, the energy, the excitement, the struggles and the sometimes surreal juxtapositions of old and new, East and West, which are Vietnam. </p>

VIETNAMERICA
The War Comes Home
<p>THOMAS A. BASS</p>
<p>The Vietnamese called the Amerasian children of U.S. servicemen bui doi, "the dust of life." Half American and half Asian, they had been abandoned by their fathers to a xenophobic society that ostracized them. Nor was the U.S. government anxious to acknowledge their paternity and assume responsibility. With the passage of the Homecoming Act, however, the Congress finally, after many years, opened the door to their immigration. Any child who could demonstrate American parentage--if only by the simple evidence of Western features--would be welcome. Relatives too. By then the children's average age was 19.</p>
<p>The federal authorities settled the Amerasians in cities like Rochester and Utica, provided them with temporary housing in dilapidated asylums and meager vocational training in jobs like motel housekeeping. Ironically, a good many began their new lives accompanied by bogus relatives who had alleged kinship in order to escape their homeland, using the Amerasians like human tickets to America for their own families and themselves.</p>
<p>Reunions with fathers were rare. The majority of young adults after a very few months were on their-own again. Little had changed for them except that in America they were illiterate in two languages and knew virtually no one. The transition was not easy for any but if the Amerasian children are anything they are survivors, however damaged. </p>

Award-winning novelist Joe O'Connor's passion for America began during
childhood holidays in the beautiful west of Ireland wilderness of Connemara,
populated exclusively by Gaelic speakers, sheep and, above all, American
tourists. His growing love affair with all things American led to an
extraordinary tour across the United States, to visit the nine different towns,
within nine different states, called Dublin and the great cities and tiny hamlets
in between. Along the way he wittily deconstructs the legends of a whole
pantheon of Irish American heroes, from John F. Kennedy to Billy the Kid, and
explores the deep connections between the most powerful country in the world
and the tiny island nation from which forty-four million Americans claim
descendancy.
<p> His journey begins in Boston, the city the Irish Americans made most profoundly their own and moves on through Dublin, New Hampshire, then the Dublins of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Indiana and Ohio. From Dublin, Georgia he makes a detour to Memphis to answer that most important question: was Elvis really Irish. He continues via Dublin, Texas, Las Vegas and San Francisco to Dublin, California. Interspersed with his travels are vivid accounts of the Irish immigrant experience and a rich exploration of the intertwined roots of American music, from Irish ballads to jazz, country, blues and gospel.</p>
<p> Sweet Liberty is a hilarious, poignant and utterly unforgettable coast-to-coast tour of the United States, a journey which celebrates the breathtaking diversity of the Irish influence on America, uncovers the secret relationship between William Butler Yeats and The Everly Brothers and actually manages to find a town called Dublin, somewhere on the planet, that doesn't have one single pub within its limits. </p>

<h1>Searching for strangers</h1>

</ul><ul></ul>

<p>NORMAN LEWIS has already proved that he is peerless as a travel writer. The enigmatic smile behind the easy prose, the controlled passion of his observation, the delicious asides have won him a world of readers. In the classic paradox of his genre he goes to the ends of the earth to find people that seldom move, whose culture accrues around them with the slowness and intricacy of coral. "I am looking for the people who have always been there and belong to the places where they live. The others I do not wish to see."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His quest for the indigenous may border on the quixotic in the fast-unravelling world, but this second volume of his autobiography begins just before the second world war when many cultures were still intact and some so beguilingly bizarre or beautiful it is hard to avoid a sense of sadness at the loss of such cherished paradises. He saw it before; we have it after.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the Costa Brava he could gain the trust of the unspoilt fishing village (Farol) by helping people tot up their sums at the village shop and by tracking down the right kind of fishing hooks (the ancient Roman type with no eyes). In the forests just north of Saigon in the era before saturation bombing, "once in a while a boar came trotting down the track, kicking up deep purple butterflies", buffalo worshippers were still around and also the Mois, a supposedly Malayo-Polynesian people who had been there almost as long as the trees themselves. In Laos, the unflinching polygamy of the royal family filled the streets of the capital with princesses all carrying parasols of five tiers. Ah, could we have but seen it. And it is easy to imagine the tall Englishman in Thailand quietly noting down the droll translation of a notice in Thai which was on display during one of their festivals:
<ul><font size=-1>All hat wearing. Brassi&egrave;res also to wear.<br>
All to dance.<br>
Partners to touch. Not walk behind.<br>
Ladies hair curl in permanent way.<br>
Low-caste no umbrella-ing.<br></font></ul>

<br>On the personal front he remains inscrutable: not for him the steaming entrails of selfhood laid out on the page. You learn that his ex-wife had re-married: "I therefore married Lesley, an old friend who had been helping me with my books." They settle in Essex, but their arrival in the early 1960s coincided with the ending of an era. Farmers annihilated weeds, wild plants, thrips, weevils, but also butterflies, moths and bees. Their poisoned corpses wiped out birds and hedgehogs who fed on them. Owls vanished. Swallows ceased to nest. "The year of our arrival the swifts had practically to queue to pass through the gap giving access to their nests in the attic. Three years later none remained. Worst of all the skies of Essex emptied of their larks. "My children..." (children?--if recollection is right, this is the only time they are referred to) "reached their teens before seeing a frog."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But one friendship is confessed--with Oliver Myers, an English archaeologist, whom he met on an Italian train in 1937--a friendship which lasted several decades until Myers's death. The attempts at supernatural communication Mr Lewis then took part in could not be a more powerful demonstration of this sceptic's depth of affection for his lost friend.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He goes to Peru happy to have the likeable Tony Snowdon tag along as his photographer but soon gets padlocked into royal ridiculousness. While purporting to pine for anonymity the photographer's luggage labels gave the game away: Right Honourable the Earl of Snowdon. In Mexico a shaman leads Mr Lewis to the top of the Sierra Madre where the Huichol custom is for the women to dip in the freezing river before dawn to promote sexual coldness, much appreciated by the males. Later the shaman invites Mr Lewis to come on a pilgrimage during which peyote would be hunted with bows and arrows because peyote were once deer who had magically changed themselves into the sacred cactus; the peyote would be prayed to and sung to before being eaten. But the shaman is murdered and Mr Lewis, now back in England, is haunted by the adventure he never took.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the years roll by the stories become sadder, notably when Mr Lewis returns to Farol and sees the municipal car park where all that beauty had been before and, even worse, when he goes to the brothel that is Thailand. On Brazilian Amazonia he highlights the massacres, land thefts and genocide, writing as one lucky to have witnessed an earlier world.</p>
<p><b>Old-age travellers</b>
<br>The search for the altogether "other" can take on a panicky flavour when the travel writer realises that the way of life he or she wishes to explore is on its last legs, as is the case with the Rabari nomads of Rajasthan in India. Robyn Davidson has produced two previous books, a somewhat fetid novel set in the rainforests of Queensland, and a newsworthy account of her travels by camel across the Australian outback. But neither is in the same league as "Desert Places", which is dazzling. Ms Davidson travelled in Rajasthan for months and grew up, quite violently, in the process.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She starts as a romantic; a dreamer haunted by schlock images of sunsets on rippling desert sands; she ends shriven, with new stature as a person and as a writer. Ms Davidson goes to extraordinary lengths to tag along with the Rabari on their next great move and there is wonderful drollery in the way she muddles through the muddle that is India. When she finally gets what she wants, with the help of a well-connected mentor, Narendra, it is not just the lack of sleep, the mangy goats and sheep on or under her bed, but the loneliness of being unable to communicate that almost drives her mad. She struggles with "Teach Yourself Gujarati", which contains sentences such as: "The lock of your musket is rusty", "You will be hanged tomorrow" and "A sepoy shot himself".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If she stops for even a second in the middle of nowhere she has to cope with the subcontinental stare; as faces instantly cram the windows, the windscreen, poking, tugging, for after all she is an attractive white woman. Someone says: "You have rupees, a jeep, why do you want to live with poor people? Why do you want to walk?" Once she confides to Narendra about her need to be alone. He orders three black goat-hair mats for her to sit on. He himself sits on another mat approximately 15 yards away. A shepherd brings marigolds and strews them about her, backing away. A woman brings incense. Another water. She sits on her mat surrounded by dust, wind, rats, scrawny, tottering sheep, donkeys with ribs like washboards and 15 yards away 50 smiling people are watching with silent respect the white woman being alone.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During the great trek she escapes from the hot grit and the hour upon hour of boredom waiting to shift camp by reading Proust, entering his cool privileged world. He lay in white sheets; she has women blowing snot, spitting and belching all around her. Men shivering with fever. Baby goats covered in sores drinking from her water pots and urinating on her mats. The air is dust. The horizon promises nothing but dust. "Where was I? Why was I here?"
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet she comes to deeply admire their use of laughter as a survival tactic and the way they always pass on truthful information to other nomads. She develops a particular warmth for them, especially for some of the women and children, but the jeep which she usually tries to avoid using is too much of a temptation to these people, although it does help immeasurably when they have to scout ahead to check the quality of the terrain. It is the same old song: 50% less land for grazing than there was ten years ago. Simply no room left in India and the nomads, despite all their flexibility, pragmatism and skills will be the first to be squeezed out. She arrives in some small and unutterably lovely place on the day the first ugly cement temple opens for celebrations. Once more the unique is being devoured by the homogenous.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In her worst moment she feels everything she is doing is fraudulent and absurd. "I knew nothing about the Rabaris and, even if I did, it would mean nothing to them, make no difference to them. I had understood nothing of where I was. And I would perpetuate the fraudulent by producing yet another useless artefact for western consumption, another bit of noise for a culture drowning in noise--an article for a glossy magazine with beautiful photos of beautiful India, beautiful noble Rabari." Ms Davidson has produced a most distinguished travel book full of a strange, tough beauty; gritty with the struggle to survive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Quite different are the appeals of "Sweet Liberty". The idea of visiting all the places in the United States called Dublin must have got a laugh in the pub. And there is a buoyancy and freshness to Joseph O'Connor's comical investigation of all nine Dublins. He writes with a poetic touch about his childhood holidays in Connemara where he fell in love with American tourists. But nothing he writes about America has the same impermeable sense of place. His American quest, being mad, is what is called a learning experience and his hyperbolic brightness sees him splendidly through the escapade. Needless to say most of the Dublins are duds and about as Irish as a Laotian princess's parasol.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His best moments are <i>en passant</i>. A guard at the Grand Canyon tells him how often people fall in: "I guess people are basically dumb...you gotta hole in the ground, folks are gonna fall in the sucker." Santa Fe is full of goodie-goodie veggies, fainting if you mention booze or fags. There is no Dublin in Tennessee but he does visit Elvis Presley's house, listening to tapes in the same little room where "the King" did his vocal tracks. The hair on the back of his neck does not so much stand up: "it was practically going for a walk round the block". He reacts to pop music with a buff's passion that might alienate the aged; the street beat bounces about in the prose like the songs. But he gets the ramshackle funkiness of it all. Classic travel writers may search out fast-disappearing strangeness, but Mr O'Connor finds a touching strangeness in the raw and the new.

Chapter One
<p>ALTHOUGH IT WAS years before I realised this had happened, the direction of my life changed in 1937 with the sudden appearance of a breathless young Englishman who dropped into the dining-car seat facing me on an Italian train. I was to learn that he had missed the earlier express he had intended to take, and had only caught this by the skin of his teeth. The seat he now occupied, moreover, had been the only one left vacant. Fortune had committed us inexorably to each other's company on our journey to Rome. Later a shared sense of victimisation drew us even closer together and we exchanged smiles of exasperation when a flustered waiter dumped before us plates of food we had not ordered. By the time the spaghetti came he was telling me about himself. His name was Oliver Myers and he was a archaeologist on his way back from a two-year dig in the Egyptian desert. This explained the deep tan and the slightly faded quality of the blue eyes exposed over long periods to the sun. Now came the coincidence that we should both be reemerging from the Islamic scene, for I was homeward bound from the Middle East where with two companions I had spent three months exploring the coasts of Southern Arabia.</p>
<p>Studying Myers I was forced to admit that, by comparison with his experiences, mine had been superficial. Apart from his dark skin and pale eyes, I noticed the cramped way four fingers were gathered to hold his fork, as if he had become accustomed to eat with his hand. I had confronted the almost impossible task of learning enough Arabic to get by. Myers spoke it fluently, although it was Arabic of the kind picked up in the course of working with illiterate fellahin. We both tried what we had to offer on each other, but there were vast areas of incomprehension. Myers was somewhat theatrical and the stream of debased arabic was accompanied by a repertoire of arm-waving and facial contortions, many seerning to reflect the shrewdness, the cunning and the fear of the browbeaten peasantry from whom he had learned them. He seemed proud of the two years he had spent sunk deeply in the primitive world, drawing my attention to a gap where a tooth that had troubled him had recently been knocked out by a hammer. Half a forefinger had gone - crushed under falling masonry. However, even sharing of interests in a language can provide a little of the social cement with which human relationships are bound together. By the time the cheese was served we were firm friends and it was a friendship that lasted thirty years, terminating only with Oliver's death. </p>

And arrived in India on the day of the worst communal violence since
Independence.
<p>The images I retained from the previous visit were tourist images: festivals, chiffon-clad women, decaying castles, peacocks settling in dusty trees. Or they were of 'old friends', stuck in improbable settings like those cardboard carnival cartoons behind which you place your face for the photograph: Narendra being lathered and shaved as he sits on a chair on his lawn; Minu covering her face with blue silk while she talks about the rights of women. The India I had constructed from books was tolerant and rational - a country where algebra, geometry and astronomy had been studied while Europe sank into its Dark Ages, where chess and the decimal system were invented, where great men and women had sacrificed themselves to an ideal and built a functioning democracy on the ruins of colonialism, where different intellectual opinions and religious beliefs could co-exist in peace - an India that bore little relation to what was going on outside this room.</p>
<p>The hotel television showed angry crowds running through streets, lathi- charging policemen, religious fanatics shouting at the camera.</p>
<p>As part of its effort to garner a vote bank, a right-wing Hindu chauvinist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had organized a march across India to Ayodhya, a small northern town revered by Hindus as the legendary birthplace of Lord Ram. There they intended to build a temple on the exact spot where there happened to be a fifteenth-century mosque - the Babri Masjid. The BJP leader Advani, who headed the ten-thousand-kilometre procession, disported himself in a giant saffron-coloured vehicle designed to look like Ram's chariot. Huge crowds of Hindu devotees had gathered, often attacking Muslim neighbourhoods along the way. Advani was arrested before he arrived at the site where a hundred thousand kar sevaks (Hindu holy volunteers) were waiting. Some of them attempted to storm the mosque. Police opened fire. The country erupted.</p>
<p>Pushkar festival was a fortnight away but people were being advised not to attend populous events and anyway, there was a public transport strike. It was impossible to buy a jeep in Delhi as they had all been requisitioned by the army. I paced the hotel room, devouring newspapers and television reports, until Narendra rang. He had to return to his farm in Jodhpur, two days' drive west into Rajasthan. He could drop me off in Pushkar on the way. We arrived there just in time to see herds of camels and their Raika owners dispersing in small groups, as ordered by batteries of armed police.</p>
<p>As for the Land of Enchantment . . . Where once little markets had cobbled together, selling everything from inlaid camel saddles to cantilevered bras, there were now rows of portable western latrines done up to look like maharajahs' tents and shops selling I'VE BEEN TO PUSHKAR T-shirts. Foreign tourists appeared to outnumber locals, most of whom had to depend on public transport which was still strike-bound. The Agriculture Ministry and the Tourism Ministry had set different dates for the fair. The nomads came early and the pilgrims came late. Any hope of heading off with the Raika was defunct.</p>
<p>Narendra went on to Jodhpur. I waited to meet the photographer Dilip Mehta who had been commissioned by the magazine to illustrate the Raika story. I already knew him and liked him. I also knew that writers and photographers belonged to different species and when push came to shove, which it inevitably did, relations between them could get a little strained. </p>

A Good Ride in Boston
<p> In America] the labourer can earn as much in one day as will support him for a week. The richest land in the world may be purchased here . . . for $1.25 an acre - equal to 5s 3d .. . If I could show them [in Ireland] the splendid prairie I am looking on, extending in wild luxuriant verdure far as the eye can reach- how different would their situation be from what it is! How gladly they would fly with their families!</p>
<p> Letter from Irish immigrant, name unknown, January 1848</p>
<p> After some stormy weather, the shores of the new world hove into sight. The port of Boston was our disembarking place, and the wharf in East Boston where we landed was of a miserable forbidding aspect. Dire poverty was to be seen all round, such wretched, horrible tenements with ragged, dirty, hungry-looking children playing in the ash heaps of a nearby railroad. It created a bad impression on me on the spot. Thinks I to myself: 'Is this the great country of "peace and plenty" there is so much talk about?'</p>
<p> From the diary of Tim Cashman, Irish immigrant, 1840s</p>
<p> It is a curious thing, but I was raised an Irish Catholic, and yet the only time I ever pray these days is on an airplane. It is odd. On terra firma I am a pagan and hedonistic rationalist who can dismiss millennia-old belief systems with a scarcely discernible raising of one eyebrow. In the air I am saying the rosary with a mumbling whiteknuckled fervour which even His Holiness the Pope would find a tad eerie. Soon as those wheels leave that tarmac my sangfroid deserts me and I am wearing the glaze off those beads. Being on an airplane is a thing I find profoundly scary. I'm not just talking about the bright orange skin foundation worn by air hostesses the world over. I'm talking about the actual flying. Hey, I know it doesn't make sense. I know airplane travel is safe. I know you have a statistically higher chance of being kicked to death by a donkey or battered into the next world by fundamentalist Armenian terrorists than you do of dying in an air crash, but still, this is not much consolation when you're plummeting towards the earth in a metal box travelling at eight hundred miles per hour and you haven't even had the chance to open your duty-free purchases.</p>
<p>So what I'm saying is, usually I pray on airplanes.</p>
<p> But I felt relatively safe on the flight from London to Boston that day. This was because the plane was full of nuns. That was the weirdest thing about the journey over. Sixty or seventy or seventyfive nuns on the plane, all in full uniform, if that's what you call it. I mean wimples, you know, and dark grey cardigans and sandals. They were all wearing wimples, and laughing together.</p>
<p>Wimple: it sounds like something you should be eating for breakfast, with maple syrup or melted butter poured over it, but no, it is actually the garment a nun wears on her head. And, hey, if you ever get close to a nun and you never know, the Catholic Church is changing a lot these days - the very last thing I suggest you do is ask permission to eat her wimple first thing the following morning. Say that to Mother Teresa of Calcutta some time and see how she responds. A swift knee in the solar plexus from the world's only living saint is certainly something a person could eat out on. But anyway. </p>

JACKDAW CAKE, Norman Lewis's first volume of autobiography, was
published to enormous acclaim. 'As a witness to his own times--the good, the
bad and the ludicrous--he is unmatched,' said the Sunday Times, while
Auberon Waugh hailed him as 'one of the best writers and most unusual
characters of our day'.
<p>Now Norman Lewis has written a further collection of memoirs that is a rich and funny and fascinating as the first. A wartime career in the Intelligence Corps, bachelor life in a crumbling fortress off the Pembrokeshire coast, reminiscences of Ian Fleming and Hemingway, travels in Guatemala, Vietnam, Burma, Spain, Cuba, Sicily, Brazil, Peru and India, rural seclusion in Essex-- Lewis describes them all with his characteristic humour, eye for detail and delight in the absurd. As Anthony Burgess said of Lewis's last book, An Empire of the East, 'His prose is almost edible...he is writing better than ever.' </p>

<p><b>Biography</p></b>
Norman Lewis was born in London. He has written thirteen novels and eleven
non-fiction works. A Dragon Apparent and Golden Earth are considered
classics of travel literature, and Naples '44 has been described as one of the ten
outstanding books about the Second World War. He relaxes by his travels to
off-beat parts of the world, which he prefers to be as remote as possible;
otherwise he lives with his family in introspective, almost monastic calm in the
depths of Essex.

<h2>D<font size=-1>ESERT</font> P<font size=-1>LACES</font>.<br></h2>

In 1978 Robyn Davidson visited, quite by chance, a camel fair in Pushkar,
Rajasthan. There she found herself amidst the pastoral nomads of north-west
India, thousands of whom had congregated to buy and sell their animals. She
was on her way to England to write her celebrated book, Tracks, about
traversing the deserts of Australia through tribal Aboriginal land - a journey
that left her obsessed with nomadism, a way of life that has been with us since
our origins but was about to disappear. As soon as she saw the Rajasthani
nomads, she wanted to accompany them on a year's migratory cycle through the
Thar Desert. The wish took the form of an image - sand-dunes, sunsets, men in
red turbans and women in pink muslin decorated with silver- a romantic ideal.
A decade later she was given an opportunity to live out that wish. But it was to
take years, and a series of false starts, before she was able to join a dang on
migration.
<p>For the Rabari, who had always survived harsh conditions, life had become increasingly grim. The loss of grazing lands, new political boundaries, and the constant threat of thefts, murders and arrests meant that migration had become a treacherous business. Some herders had decided to sell most of their animals and not migrate, others to travel without women, still others to abandon their traditional means of livelihood, drift to the cities and find jobs. All were nervous about the responsibility of having a white woman with them. But in 1992 Robyn Davidson was finally accepted into a group in Gujarat and they set off.</p>
<p>She was determined to live as they lived, to 'enter the frame'. Which meant that she too slept among five thousand sheep, drank Guinea-worm-infested water, survived on goats' milk and roti. But it was not so much the physical discomforts which exhausted her as the isolation imposed by the lack of a common language. Yet solitude was denied her too and crowds gathered wherever she went. It became a journey of extremity and sickness and frightening rages. Sometimes the countryside was beguiling, sometimes brutalized, but always a place in which desperate people fought over few remaining resources. Any lingering romanticism concerning Indian rural life was destroyed. But a profound respect and affection for her hosts was forged. She could return to comfort and security; for the nomads, it was real life.</p>
<p>In this brave and moving journey, Robyn Davidson travels the last pathways of the last pathways of the Rabari, the 'keepers of the way', and in so doing explores, with ruthless honesty, her own desert places.

</p><p>L'Ile et une nuit. Le cyclone se derige vers la Guadeloupe. Partout, on s'enferme, on cloue portes et fenetres. Il va falloir resister toute la nuit aux elements dechaines.
</p><p>Marie-Gabriel veille, seule dans la maison barricadee de Flamboyants, la &lt;&lt;maison-mre&gt;&gt;. Antillaise Sheherazade, elle parle pour apprivoiser  la peur, trouver force et courage, pendant les sept heures que dure le cyclone. Sept heures, sept chapitres, sept modes ou la voix humaine, le telephone, l'ecriture, la musique se conjugent a d'autres voix plus anciennes que l'homme: murmures des dieux, parole de l'ouragan, de la case et du manguier. A la fin, le narrateur se demasque, reprenant les contes creoles et les grands mythes fondateurs de l'Amerique latine pour les meler a une Histoire generale du deluge, dans une eblouissante re-creation du monde. Ce roman s'inscrit dans la continuite de L'Isole Soleil et de Soufrieres, et conclut l'histoire de Marie-Gabriel, une jeune Antillaise d'aujourd'hui. It est aussu l'affirmation d'une energie litteraire dont la Caraibe serait le creuset, Mediterranee tropicale ouverte a tous le metissages, dans toutes ses langues d'election: creole, francais, espagnol, anglais. <br>

HE winter's literary phenomenon in France is Andre&iuml; Makine's "Le Testament Fran&ccedil;ais". A bolt from beyond the Urals, this novel by an almost unknown writer who came to France from Siberia eight years ago won both of the most prestigious French fiction prizes at the end of last year, the Prix Goncourt and the Prix M&eacute;dicis. Although the M&eacute;dicis was shared with "La Langue Maternelle" (a similar book by an exile from Greece), "doing the double" was until now unheard of.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Makine has ruffled the smooth surface of French publishing in other ways. The big Paris houses expect to get the big literary prizes in rotation, much as the large French banks once each took their agreed ration of the government-bond business. The Goncourt almost invariably goes to one or other of "Galligrasseuil", the collective name for the Paris "Big Three": Gallimard, Grasset and Le Seuil. But this time for once the Goncourt and the M&eacute;dicis both went not just to an unknown author but to a pippin-sized offshoot of Gallimard: Mercure de France.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The shock of all this to the tight world of French literary prizes should not obscure the fact that Mr Makine has written an agreeable novel, or rather an agreeable book that hovers between fiction and family biography. "Le Testament Fran&ccedil;ais"is the story of the narrator's French grandmother in self-chosen Siberian exile. The background is Russia's civil war, Stalinism and France, an ever-distant promised land imagined as a vivid place of sensuality and revolt, "where the cobbles of the streets had the extraordinary capacity to rise up as ramparts". This is an old-fashioned, linear narrative which tells a classic tale of personal growth. Its weeks high on the best-seller list (see box on next page) may be due as much to the story of the book as to the story in the book: a "Goncourt of the steppes" by a poor, solitary Russian, ignored by the big boys and now loaded with success.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"La Quarantaine" by J.M.G. Le Cl&eacute;zio, one of the dominant figures of contemporary French fiction, is set on Flat Island, a quarantine station for passengers on the way to Mauritius. The narrator tells of his grandfather L&eacute;on's quarantine, his fight for survival, his isolation on this island-cemetery, and also of the young L&eacute;on's awakening to love with Suryavati, a young woman born on the island. L&eacute;on himself then becomes a narrator, deciding to break with his biological family and join the family he has chosen for himself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His story frames that of Ananta, Suryavati's mother, who has come down the Ganges to end up on this island in the Indian Ocean. In some way each narrator finds a meaning to life through telling the story of an unknown, a real or imagined ancestor to whom he lends his voice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Daniel Maximin is one of the new generation of French-speaking authors from the Caribbean, where French writing seems to be finding exciting new resources. In "L'Ile et une Nuit" a hurricane makes its way towards the home of a young Caribbean woman, Marie-Gabriel, who must deal with it as she can. Though put together with strict respect for the unities--time, place and action--this novel is poetically written and has a sensual intensity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An island, metaphorically, is somewhere you cannot run away from and where you have to face whatever is coming. For Marie-Gabriel, who appears in turn as character and narrator, the hurricane is a test. She must decide about what is essential: her life, her love. Gradually her speech sheds its everyday artifice and becomes an expression of naked desire. Measuring herself against the elements, Marie-Gabriel finds her mark, and her voice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With "Ici", by contrast, readers are back with the severe charms of the <i>nouveau roman</i>. Nathalie Sarraute is one of the grand figures of this now venerable genre of semi-philosophical fiction in which nothing much happens but a vast amount is noticed, imagined or thought about. The crux of Ms Sarraute's new book is what gets said, its source, its moment of articulation. "Ici" (Here) is where words and phrases are uttered: not the bed or the bar but somewhere far more cerebral. A name on the tip of the tongue, a polite phrase, a stupid question, a silence even. Where do they come from? These seeming commonplaces she makes abstract and unfamiliar, writing, in her words, "to show what is there" in speech. On such questions Ms Sarraute focuses much analytical subtlety but, true to the rules of philosophical fiction, gives nothing so mundane as answers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"L'Enigme" is different again. The Knigh (sic) family's yacht, adrift at sea, is the stage for a literary mystery. The members of this singular family--poets, novelists and philosophers--have come together for a reading cruise. Suddenly, silence. The family has gone. The texts break off. What happened? That is the enigma for the novel's three sleuths: an academic theorist versed in the Knigh family's works; a poetical criminologist, skilled at literary clues and motives; and a marine investigator, who understands the sea's emotional power. The half-finished works on the deck of this intellectual <i>Marie Celeste </i>are evidence for a clever, crossword-like inquiry.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russia and France, two islands, a yacht, even Ms Sarraute's "here" are all places, some real, some imagined. But does anything happen in them? Unenthusiasts for recent French fiction complain that too many novels written in France have no real action or subject-matter: they are not about anything. Mr Makine's book aside, this list might seem to bear them out. But the tradition of the reflective novel is an old one in France, much older than the <i>nouveau roman</i>. The theatre of the mind is treated there as a perfectly normal subject of fiction. In the proper hands--and these authors are each in their way strong writers--it can even be readable.

</p><p>Encore enfant, je devinais que ce sourire tres singulier representait pour chaque femme une etrange petite victoire. Oui, une ephemere revanche sur les espoirs decus, sur la grossierete des hommes, sur la rarete des choses belles et vraies dans ce monde. Si j'avais su le dire, a l'epoque, j'aurais appele cette facon de sourire &lt;&lt;feminite &gt;&gt;... Mais ma langue etait alors trop concrete. Je me contentais d'examiner, dans nos albums de photos, les visages feminins et de retrouver ce reflet de beaute sur certains d'entre eux.
</p><p>Car ces femmes savaient que pour etre belles, il fallait, quelques secondes avant que le flash ne les aveugle, prononcer ces mysterieuses syllabes francaises dont peu connaissaient le sens: &lt;&lt; pe-tite-pomme... &gt;&gt; Comme par enchantement, la bouche, au lieu de s'etirer dans une beatitude enjouee ou de se crisper dans un rictus anxieux, formait ce gracieux arrondi. Le visage tout entier en demeurait transfigure. Les sourcils s'arquaient legerement, l'ovale des joues s'allongeait. On disait &lt;&lt;petite pomme &gt;&gt;, et l'ombre d'une douceur lointaine et reveuse voilait le regard, affinait les traits, laissait planer sur le cliche la lumiere tamisee des jours anciens.
</p><p>Une telle magie photographique avait conquis la confiance des femmes les plus diverses. Cette parente moscovite, par exemple, sur l'unique cliche de couleur de nos albums. Mariee a un diplomate, elle parlait sans desserrer les dents et soupirait d'ennui avant meme de vous avoir ecoute. Mais sur la photo, je distinguais tout de suite l'effet de la  &lt;&lt; petite pomme &gt;&gt;.
</p><p>Je remarquais son halo sur le visage de cette provinciale terne, quelque tante anonyme et dont on n'evoquait le nom que pour parler des femmes restees sans mari apres l'hecatombe masculine de la derniere guerre. Meme Glacha, la paysanne de la famille, arborait sur de rares photos qui nous restaient d'elle ce sourire miraculeux. Il y avait enfin tout un essaim de jeunes cousines qui gonflaient les levres en essayant de retenir pendant quelques interminables secondes de pose ce fuyant sortilege francais. En murmurant leur &lt;&lt; petite pomme &gt;&gt;, elles croyaient encore que la vie a venir serait tissee uniquement de ces instants de grace...
</p><p>Ce defile de regards et de visages etait traverse, de loin en loin, par celui d'une femme aux traits reguliers et fins, aux grands yeux gris. D'abord jeune, dans les albums les plus anciens, son sourire s'impregnait du charme secret de la &lt;&lt; petite pomme &gt;&gt;. Puis, avec l'age, dans les albums de plus en plus neufs et proches de notre temps, cette expression s'estompait, se nuancant d'un voile de melancolie et de simplicite. <br>

</p><p>Dans la salle enfumee, eclairee par les quinquets, il est apparu. Il a ouvert la porte, et sa silhouette est restee un instant dans l'encadrement, contre la nuit. Jacques n'avait jamais oublie. Si grand que sa tete touchait presque au chambranle, ses cheveux longs et hirsutes, son visage tres clair aux traits enfantins, ses longs bras et ses mains larges, son corps mal a l'aise dans une veste etriquee boutonnee tres haut. Surtout, cet air egare, le regard etroit plein de mechancete, trouble par l'ivresse. Il est reste immobile a la porte, comme s'il hesitait, puis il a commence a lancer des insultes, des menaces, il brandissait ses poings. Alors le silence s'est installe dans la salle.
</p><p>Je pense a la facon dont mon grand-pere a vu Rimbaud, la premiere fois. C'etait au debut de l'annee 1872, en janvier ou fevrier. Je peux determiner la date a cause de la mort d'Amalia, et de la visite du Major William dans le magasin de bondieuseries et pompes funebres au rez-dechaussee de son immeuble de la rue Saint-Sulpice. Apres la rupture avec le Patriarche et leur expulsion de la propriete d'Anna, leur depart de Maurice, a la fin de l'annee 71, Antoine et Amalia s'etaient installes a Paris, dans le quartier de Montparnasse. Il faisait cet hiver-la un froid mortel a Paris, la Seine charriait des glacoons. Amalia etait mal remise de la firvre qui s'etait declaree apres la naissance de Leon. Peut-etre que la dispute avec Alexandre l'avait rendue encore plus fragile. Elle est morte d'une pneumonie dans les derniers jours de janvier. Leon n'avait pas un an. Mon grand-pere Jacques avait tout juste neuf ans. C'est en accompagnant son oncle William qu'il a du entrer dans le cafe, a l'angle de la rue Madame et de la rue Saint-Sulpice. L'oncle a pense que ca n'etait pas de l'age deJacques d entrer dans le magasin pour choisir une couronne. Il l'a laisse dans le bistrot, attable devant un bol de vin chaud. <br>

<h2></i>L'I<font size=-1>LE ET UNE </font>N<font size=-1>UIT</font><br></h2>

</p><p><p>L'autre cyclone du siecle est annonce.</p>
</p><p>L'energie-desespoir prend des forces depuis trois jours sur l'ocean de septembre, preparant son menu d'iles-Caraibes a devaster au hasard.
</p><p>Nous allons laisser vivre la catastrophe jusqu'a la satiete de sa violence, brasser reves et cauchemars sans dormir, pour avoir une chance d'arriver jusqu'a sa fin, qui aura bien degage le ciel pour le premier soleil, afin qu'il seche vite le pain, les yeux, l'espoir et les matelas.
</p><p>Nous allons chercher ensemble les mots qui disent a la fois la tragedie de la lumiere coupee et la resistance de la derniere bougie, jusqu'au relais du jour qui finira la veillee.
</p><p>Ensemble, nous aurons tres soif de paroles enracinees, nous allons reveiller en nous la franchise et l'invention des conteurs des soirs de mortalite. Seuls, entre nous, sans le voisinage occupe a ses propres deuils. Sauf que la maison ne passera pas la nuit ouverte pour laisser l'ame du mort s'en aller tranquille hors de son cercueil.
</p><p>Ce sera une veillee sans contes ni chansons, ou il nous faudra pourtant sans cesse caresser nos peurs et nos silences pour ne pas engourdir les gestes de survie, sortir toutes nos reserves de paroles les plus fortes, les plus belles, les plus imaginees vraies.
</p><p>Une veillee non pour celebrer la mort (pas de suicide pendant une nuit de cyclone), mais pour soutenir ensemble la resistance de nos maisons et de nos arbres, et surveiller sans relache les bougies, car on ne saurait laisser bruler la case sous pretexte de laisser le vent dehors.
</p><p>Qui marche seul n'avance pas. Qui meurt tout seul ne seme pas. Qui espere seul n'attend rien. La Guadeloupe est plus qu'un arbre. Meme sans racines elle peut fleurir. Notre ile est une vraie case, edifiee par notre grande famille d'orphelins fiances. Assez fertile en cas de cyclone, seisme ou eruption pour preserver des grains de sable et des gouttes d'ecume et recolter des racines. <br>

</p><p>Il va revenir, il n'a pas disparu pour toujours, c'est impossible, il etait la depuis si longtemps... c'est cette silhouette frele, legerement voutee... presque effacee... c'est elle qui l'avait amene ici pour la premiere fois, il etait arrive porte par elle et il etait reste ici plus solidement implante qu'elle.
</p><p>Il y avait en lui quelque chose d'insolite, de frappant qui l'avait fait s'incruster ici plus fortement, n' en plus bouger... Et voila que tout a coup la ou il etait, ou c'etait sur qu'il se trouverait, cette beance, ce trou... &lt;&lt; Un trou de memoire &gt;&gt; comme on dit negligemment, insouciamment, sans vouloir s'y attarder davantage... Si ce n'est pas indispensable, a quoi bon se fatiguer, s'abrutir a s'efforcer de le remplir, ce trou, pourquoi perdre son temps ? Mais ici ce qu'il a laisse derriere lui, cette ouverture, cette rupture disjoint, disloque, fait chanceler... il faut absolument la colmater, il faut a tout prix qu'il revienne, qu'il s'encastre ici a nouveau, qu'il occupe toute sa place...
</p><p>Mais rien n'est reste de lui, rien par quoi l'accrocher, le tirer, pas le moindre signe distinctif, pas le plus vague signalement. Meme de parcourir, pourquoi pas ? tous les prenoms du calendrier ne permettrait pas de le reconnaitre...
</p><p>Et cependant il ne doit pas etre loin, il est surement tout pres, il peut a tout moment se manifester... Peut-etre vaut-il mieux ne plus s'agiter, prendre patience, esperer, toutes les forces vives d'ici mobilisees, concentrees, maintenues constamment en etat d'alerte... <br>

<h2>L'E<font size=-1>NIGME</font><br></h2>

</p><p>
</p><p>L'Enqueteur du Domaine maritime et le Theseur descendent vers le port. <br> Coupant a travers les entrepots, ils gagnent la cale seche ou l'Ouranos se dresse, <br> bleute par le soir qui doucement l'efface.
</p><p>- Rien n'est plus surprenant qu'un cabin-cruiser, tel que l'Ouranos, lorsqu'on le decouvre en cale seche, dit l'Enqueteur du Domaine maritime, alors qu'ils grimpent tous les deux le long de l'echelle de fer qu'un tracteur avait avancee et appuyee contre le flanc lisse. Voyez comme la ligne de flottaison se distingue par une quantite de griffures teintees de sang, dit l'Enqueteur au moment ou ils parviennent a mi-hauteur, ils se sont tous acharnes sans reussir a trouver la moindre asperite pour remonter a bord. Mais nous examinerons mieux au jour ces traces, d'autant que nous avons fait une etrange et bien surprenante decouverte. Venez, traversons le pont et descendons visiter les cabines. Tout est reste en l'etat. A part les manuscrits que mon ami le Criminologiste et moi avons fait enlever des differentes cabines, rien n'a ete touche dans le poste de commande pas plus que sur le pont. La bibliotheque est intacte, ainsi que la cuisine. Seules les provisions perissables ont ete jetees apres inventaire. Passons par cette coursive, continue l'Enqueteur, montrant le chemin au Theseur. Ici, vous avez la cabine de Karl Knigh, la plus spacieuse avec son bureau en bois de teck, la les deux lits, le sien et celui de Lotte Knigh, sa jeune femme. Les manuscrits de Karl Knigh, nous les avons trouves impeccablement ranges sur le bureau, et aussi dans les tiroirs. Ceux de Lotte Knigh, plutot ses carnets - vous pourrez les examiner tout a l'heure-, ont ete decouverts derriere ses robes, dans la penderie. Quant au reste, le desordre a ete scrupuleusement respecte; tout a ete photographie, repere, comptabilise, afin que le dossier concernant l'enigme de l'Ouranos soit bien net et au complet. Maintenant, poursuit l'Enqueteur, passons, voulez-vous, par cette porte, ainsi vous pourrez jeter un coup d'ceil dans la cabine qu'occupaient Rosa Zhorn- Knigh, Kurt Knigh et Gustav Zhorn. A part le meme desordre que dans la cabine du vieux Knigh et sa jeune femme, rien de particulier, sauf cette feuille de papier epinglee sur la paroi, avec les vers que voici. Nous les supposons de Kurt Knigh.
</p><p>Cain deja ! voyez l'instant fulgurant la lame se leve <br> s'abat sur la tombe verdatre <br> Luit le bronze avant         qu'il ne perce    la terre <br> se releve mat poisseux noir <br> Premier sang humain nuit sur le monde - <br> fils de Cain notre pere !
</p><p>Et au verso ces vers encore, de la meme ecriture:
</p><p>La triple deesse gouverne le monde quand du chaos <br> surgit Ouranos dieu obscur <br> Aux fentes secretes de la Terre-Mere il incline la pluie <br> en rivieresclaires <br> Herbes fleurs arbres oiseaux naissent dans les creux <br> ainsi que les premiers etres <br> Mi-chair mi-ame - nous aux abysses par Arno jetes !
</p><p>- Ouranos ? Croyez-vous qu'en affichant ces vers comportant le nom du <br> bateau de son pere, Kurt Knigh aurait voulu nous donner une indication <br> posthume sur le sens de l'enigme ?
</p><p>- Si ces vers m'etaient parvenus avant que ne paraisse ma these sur la <br> famille Knigh, j'aurais ete heureux de pouvoir les y inclure, dit le Theseur. <br> Puisje garder cette feuille ? <br>

</p><p>
</p><p>&lt;&lt; Je me souvenais qu'un jour, dans une plaisanterie sans gaite, Charlotte m'avait dit qu'apres tous ses voyages a travers l'immense Russie, venir a pied jusqu'en France n'aurait pour elle rien d'impossible [...]. Au debut, pendant de longs mois de misere et d'errances, mon reve fou ressemblerait de pres a cette bravade. J'imaginerais une femme vetue de noir qui, aux toutes premieres heures d'une matinee d'hiver sombre, entrerait dans une petite ville frontaliere [...]. Elle pousserait la porte d'un cafe au coin d'une etroite place endormie, s'installerait pres de la fenetre, a cote d'un calorifere. La patronne lui apporterait une tasse de the. Et en regardant, derriere la vitre, la face tranquille des maisons a colombages, la femme murmurerait tout bas: "C'est la France... Je suis retournee en France. Apres... apres toute une vie." &gt;&gt;
</p><p>Ce roman, superbement compose, a l'originalite de nous offrir de la France une vision mythique et lointaine, a travers les nombreux recits que Charlotte Lemonnier, &lt;&lt; egaree dans l'immensite neigeuse de la Russie &gt;&gt;, raconte a son petit-fils et confident. Cette France, qutexplore a son tour le narrateur, apparait comme un regard neuf et penetrant sur le monde. <br>

</p><p>&lt;&lt; Que reste-t-il les emotions, des reves, des desirs quand on disparait? L'homme d'Aden, l'empoisonneur de Harrar sont-ils les memes que l'adolescent furieux qui poussa une nuit la porte du cafe de la rue Madame, son regard sombre passant sur un enfant de neuf ans qui etait mon grand-pere?  Je marche elans toutes ces rues, j'entends le bruit de mes talons qui resonne dans la nuit, rue Victor-Cousin, rue Serpente, place Maubert, dans les rues de la Contrescarpe. Celui que je cherche n'a plus de nom. II est moins qu'une ombre, moins qu'une trace, moins qu'un fantome. Il est en moi, comme une vibration, comme un desir, un elan de l'imagination, un rebond de coeur, pour mieux m'envoler. D'ailleurs je prends demain l'avion pour l'autre bout du monde. L'autre extremite du temps. &gt;&gt; <br>

</p><p>The Wage Curve David G. Blanchflower and Andrew J. Oswald
</p><p>The Wage Curve casts doubt on some of the most important ideas in macroeconomics, labor economics, and regional economics. According to macroeconomic orthodoxy, there is a relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages. According to orthodoxy in labor economics and regional economics, an area's wage is positively related to the amount of joblessness in the area. The Wage Curve suggests that both these beliefs are incorrect.
</p><p>Blanchflower and Oswald argue that the stable relationship is a downward-sloping convex curve linking local unemployment and the level of pay. Their study, one of the most intensive in rhe history of social science, is based on random samples that provide computerized information on nearly four million people from sixteen countries. Throughout, the authors systematically present evidence and possible explanations for their empirical "law" of economics. <br>

<p>WHAT sets pay levels? Why do people who want jobs not find them? Few markets match the labour market in complexity and importance. Frustratingly, few markets are so poorly understood. Standard economic theory treats the labour market like any other: the demand curve for labour slopes down, its supply curve slopes up and where they cross is the market-clearing or "equilibrium" wage at which anyone wanting work gets hired. Pushing up wages artificially--a minimum wage, for example--must, in this framework, leave some people without jobs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These two books dispute the standard theory, and in a novel way. Economists tend to posit theories first and test them later. These authors gather evidence that seems to puncture conventional wisdom and then suggest alternative theories.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Messrs Card and Krueger look at minimum wages. Their evidence, they believe, shows that raising minimum wage rates need not lower employment and may even at times increase it. Raising minimum wages, they add, can reduce inequality, by raising the relative pay of low-paid workers. This is a contentious topic and the Card-Krueger argument has caused glee on the left, horror on the right. But reactions on each side are probably overdone. Colleagues have questioned the methods and scope of the Card-Krueger findings. Nor is their suggestion that at the low end firms may be able to push wages below market levels likely to win universal approval.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The Wage Curve" is more ambitious. Its authors aim to establish a negative correlation between wage rates and unemployment that does not change with time or place: be she American, British or C&ocirc;te D'Ivoirean, they argue, someone hired in a region of high unemployment must earn less than an identical worker in an area of low unemployment. Their finding, if correct, is more startling than it sounds. The standard theory, assuming flexible wages, predicts that the labour market will clear at the appropriate wage level. But the world works differently, according to the authors: where unemployment is high, wages are simply stuck at low levels. The book's sheer quantity of observation makes it difficult to deny that high unemployment means low, not falling, wages. The hard question is why.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Messrs Blanchflower and Oswald deny that their curve is a mislabelled variant of the Phillips Curve (which claimed a negative link between wage inflation and joblessness). Nor, they say, does it reflect movements along an upward-sloping labour supply curve. Instead they propose alternatives including a "bargaining" model, in which high unemployment weakens workers' bargaining power and so depresses wages.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Blanchflower-Oswald findings pose a problem for the standard model. On the other hand, their alternatives are not wholly convincing either. Labour ececonomics is in ferment. This book is a good point of entry to the argument.</td></tr></table>

<p>WHY do economies grow? What fixes the long-run rate of growth? These are some of the simplest, but also hardest, questions in economics. Growth or lack of it has huge consequences for a country's citizens. But for various reasons, growth theory has had long fallow patches. Happily, this is changing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1956 Robert Solow developed what became the standard neo-classical model of economic growth. Countries grow, on this theory, by accumulating labour and capital. Adding either obeys diminishing returns: the more labour or capital you already have, the more you need for a further given jump in output. One consequence is that an economy with less capital ought to outgrow one with more. Generally, they do. Another is that growth should eventually drop to zero. Awkwardly, it stays positive. To save the theory, long-run growth was explained by an outside factor, technical innovation, which is not in the growth function itself--hence the label "exogenous" for the Solow family of models.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Partial as it was, the Solow model won wide acceptance and growth theory slumbered for three decades. Then came two changes. One was an attempt to add technical change and other factors to labour and capital within the growth function so that the model might predict long-run growth without leaning on outside "residuals"--the so-called "endogenous" approach. The other was a huge number of factual studies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The authors explain all this and more with admirable clarity (and much demanding maths) in the first modern textbook devoted to growth theory. The main theories are examined. The stress throughout is on linking theory to fact. One of three chapters on empirical work suggests how much each of several possible factors would be needed to explain differing international growth rates--not an explanation itself, but an indispensable set of empirical benchmarks.

By Joseph Stiglitz.<br>
<i>MIT Press; 352 pages; $32.95 and &#163;27.50</i><br>
<a href="3ex51.html">Extract</a> - <a href="3jb51.html">Jacket Copy</a> - <a href="3bt51.html">Biography</a><br>


<p>THIS title causes needless confusion: for the author, as for most people, outdated socialism is going nowhere. Mr Stiglitz writes, in addition, stodgy prose. Yet "Whither Socialism?" is to be recommended. It offers deep new thinking on a big subject: the role of the state. It is rigorous and accessible, a rare combination.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The book sets out to examine how the countries of Eastern Europe should reform their economies. The advice comes late, but this hardly matters. The book's strength is its criticism of standard accounts of market economics. Mr Stiglitz deals briskly with the empty dispute about whether there can exist a "middle way" between socialism and capitalism. Obviously there can, since every successful modern industrial economy has taken one. The pertinent, forward-looking question is how far, and in which ways, the state should now intervene.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The balance between state and market which Mr Stiglitz proposes will not seriously distress free-market liberals. But the reasons he advances are interestingly different from the common "markets-know-best" ones. "Whither Socialism?" makes good use of the best and newest work in several branches of economics, but pays particular attention to the economics of information. Gathering information is costly, which causes frictions in the smoothness with which markets adjust. Developing this insight, Mr Stiglitz sheds exciting light on what is perhaps the key issue of political economy in our time.

</p><p><p>Introduction</p>
</p><p>This book uses data from many countries to explore the workings of the labor market. It attempts to document the existence of an empirical "law" of economics. The law features two of the variables that most interest policymakers, namely, the level of unemployment and the level of wages. These are linked, it is argued here, by a curve or formula described by figure 1.1. Because the wage curve is not part of conventional economics, most of the chapters to come are designed as collections of new evidence for it. Data on approximately three and a half million people, from twelve countries, are used in the analysis. Secondary evidence, drawing upon others' recent work, is also discussed. Some of this covers further nations.
</p><p>The relationship captured in figure 1.1 raises obvious questions. What does this curve mean? Is it not unrealistic to believe in laws of behavior in a subject such as economics, which studies human beings? How, in a field where experiments are almost impossible, could there be any convincing scientific basis for this wage curve? Why does the figure look like a Phillips curve with the vertical axis mislabeled? How does the relationship fit into existing knowledge? What causes the curve? What, if anything, does all this imply for policymakers and their economic advisers?
</p><p>These are some of the questions tackled in the next several hundred pages. The book's modus operandi is to draw upon random samples of workers and establishments from various nations. It uses the sarne statistical methods on each sample and aims to demonstrate that these intemational samples all reveal approximately the same curve. This book describes the search for a common pattern in data. To be convincing, such an approach needs data of high quality. In the natural sciences such data would normally be collected as part of controlled experiments, and a proposition would not normally be thought of as proved until many different investigations replicated the essential finding. However, much science, especially medical science, proceeds in a less orderly way. A good example is the discovery - usually attributed to the Oxford researcher Sir Richard Doll - that smoking raises the probability of contracting lung cancer and other diseases. This fact emerged from an examination of survey information on British individuals. The data contained a "natural experiment": some people smoked and some did not. With the help of simple statistical methods, it could be shown that, other things being constant, there seemed to be a relationship between smoking and ill-health. Since then the same pattern has, of course, emerged in many other studies, and most Western governments have brought in policies to discourage smoking. Doll's discovery provides an illustration of how nonexperimental methods can uncover relationships. Although the topic covered in this book is far from those tackled in medical science, there are certain similarities in the underlying methods. <br>

</p><p><p>CHAPTER 1</p>
</p><p>Introduction and Overview
</p><p>There are two excesses to avoid in regard to hypotheses: the
</p><p>one of valuing them too much, the other of forbidding them
</p><p>entirely.
</p><p>- The Encyclopedie of Diderot and D'Alembert
</p><p>NEARLY 50 YEARS AGO, George Stigler implored economists to be "outspoken, and singularly agreed" that increases in the minimum wage reduce employment. The reasoning behind this prediction is simple and compelling. According to the model presented in nearly every introductory economics textbook, an increase in the minimum wage lowers the employment of minimum-wage workers. This logic has convinced most economists: polls show that more than 90 percent of professional economists agree with the prediction that a higher minimum wage reduces employment. Such a high degree of consensus is remarkable in a profession renowned for its bitter disagreements. But there is one problem: the evidence is not singularly agreed that increases in the minimum wage reduce employment. This book presents a new body of evidence showing that recent minimum wage increases have not had the negative employment effects predicted by the textbook model. Some of the new evidence points toward a positive effect of the minimum wage on employment; most shows no effect at all. Moreover, a reanalysis of previous minimum wage studies finds little support for the prediction that minimum wages reduce employment. If accepted, our findings call into question the standard model of the labor market that has dominated economists' thinking for the past half century.
</p><p>Our main empirical findings can be summarized as follows. First, a study of employment in the fast-food industry after the recent 1992 increase in the New Jersey minimum wage shows that employment was not affected adversely by the law. Our results are derived from a specially designed survey of more than 400 restaurants throughout New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania, conducted before and after the increase in the New Jersey minimum wage. Relative to restaurants in Pennsylvania, where the minimum wage remained unchanged, we find that employment in New Jersey actually expanded with the increase in the minimum wage. Furthermore, when we examine restaurants within New Jersey, we find that employment growth was higher at restaurants that were forced to increase their wages to comply with the law than at those stores that already were paying more than the new minimum. We find similar results in studies of fast-food restaurants in Texas after the 1991 increase in the federal minimum wage, and of teenage workers after the 1988 increase in California's minimum wage.
</p><p>Second, a cross-state analysis finds that the 1990 and 1991 increases in the federal minimum wage did not affect teenage employment adversely. The federal minimum increased from $3.35 per hour to $3.80 on April 1, 1990, and to $4.25 per hour on April 1, 1991. We categorized states into groups on the basis of the fraction of teenage workers who were earning between $3.35 and $3.80 per hour just before the first minimum-wage increase took effect. In high-wage states, such as California and Massachusetts, relatively few teenagers were in the range in which the minimum-wage increase would affect pay rates, whereas in low-wage states, such as Mississippi and Alabama, as many as 50 percent of teenagers were in the affected wage range. On the basis of the textbook model of the minimum wage, one would expect teenage employment to decrease in the lowwage states, where the federal minimum wage raised pay rates, relative to high-wage states, where the minimum had far less effect. Contrary to this expectation, our results show no meaningful difference in employment growth between high-wage and low-wage states. If anything, the states with the largest fraction of workers affected by the minimum wage had the largest gains in teenage employment. This conclusion continues to hold when we adjust for differences in regional economic growth that occurred during the early 1990s, and conduct the analysis with state-level data, rather than regional data. A similar analysis of employment trends for a broader sample of lowwage workers, and for employees in the retail trade and restaurant industries, likewise fails to uncover a negative employment effect of the federal minimum wage.
</p><p>Third, we update and reevaluate the time-series analysis of teenage employment that is the most widely cited evidence for the prediction that a higher minimum wage reduces employment. When the same econometric specifications that were used during the 1970s are reestimated with data from more recent years, the historical relationship between minimum wages and teenage employment is weaker and no longer statistically significant. We also discuss and reanalyze several previous minimum-wage studies that used crosssectional or panel data. <br>

</p><p><p>MYTH AND MEASUREMENT</p>
</p><p>THE NEW ECONOMICS OF THE MINIMUM WAG E
</p><p>DAVID CARD ALAN B. KRUEGER
</p><p>David Card and Alan B. Krueger have already made national news with their pathbreaking research on the minimum wage. Here they present a powerful new challenge to the conventional view that higher minimum wages reduce jobs for low-wage workers. In a work that has important implications for public policy as well as for the direction of economic research, the authors put standard economic theory to the test, using data from a series of recent episodes, including the 1992 increase in New Jersey's minimum wage, the 1988 rise in California's minimum wage, and the 1990-91 increases in the federal minimum wage. In each case they present a battery of evidence showing that increases in the minimum wage lead to increases in pay, but no loss in jobs.
</p><p>A distinctive feature of Card and Krueger's research is the use of empirical methods borrowed from the natural sciences, including comparisons between the "treatment" and "control" groups formed when the minimum wage rises for some workers but not for others. In addition, the authors critically reexamine the previous literature on the minimum wage and find that it, too, lacks support for the claim that a higher minimum wage cuts jobs. Finally, the effects of the minimum wage on family earnings, poverty outcomes, and the stock market valuation of low-wage employers are documented. Overall, this book calls into question the standard model of the labor market that has dominated economists' thinking on the minimum wage. In addition, it will shift the terms of the debate on the minimum wage in Washington and in state legislatures throughout the country. <br>

<p>
</p><p><p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</p><p>I.1 THE IMPORTANCE OF GROWTH
</p><p>The real per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States grew by a factor of 8.1 from $2244 in 1870 to $18,258 in 1990, all measured in 1985 dollars. The increase in real per capita GDP corresponds to a growth rate of 1.75 percent per year. This performance gave the United States the highest level of real per capita GDP in the world in 1990 (with the possible exception of the United Arab Emirates, an oil producer with a small population).
</p><p>To appreciate the consequences of apparently small differentials in growth rates when compounded over long periods of time, we can calculate where the United States would have been in 1990 if it had grown since 1870 at 0.75 percent per year, one percentage point per year below its actual rate. A growth rate of 0.75 percent per year is close to the rate experienced in the long run - from 1900 to 1987 - by India (0.64 percent per year). Pakistan (0.88 percent per year), and the Philippines (0.86 percent per year). If the United States had begun in 1870 at a real per capita GDP of $2244 and had then grown at a rate of 0.75 percent per year over the next 120 years, then its real per capita GDP in 1990 would have been $5519, only 2.5 times the value in 1870 and 30 percent of the actual value in 1990 of $18,258. Then, instead of ranking first in the world in 1990, the United States would have ranked 37th out of 127 countries with data. To put it another way, if the growth rate had been lower by just 1 percentage point per year, then the U.S. real per capita GDP in 1990 would have been close to that in Mexico and Hungary and would have been about $1000 less than that in Portugal and Greece.
</p><p>Suppose. altematively, that the U.S. real per capita GDP had grown since 1870 at 2.75 percent per year, 1 percentage point per year greater than the actual value. This higher growth rate is close to those experienced in the long run by Japan (2.95 percent per year from 1890 to l990) and Taiwan (2.75 percent per year from 1900 to 1987). If the United States had still begun in 1870 at a real per capita GDP of $9244 and had then grown at a rate of 2.75 percent per year over the next 120 years, then its real per capita GDP in 1990 would have been $60,841 - 27 times the value in 1870 and 3.3 times the actual value in 1990 of $18,258. A real per capita GDP of $60,841 is well outside the historical experience of any country and may, in fact, be infeasible. We can say, however, that a continuation of the long-term U.S. growth rate of 1.75 percent per year implies that the United States will not attain a real per capita GDP of $60,841 until the year 2059. <br>

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
<p>
</p><p><p>The Theory of Socialism and the Power of Economic Ideas</p>
</p><p>We have come to learn in this century of the power of economic ideas. It is not just in the debating halls of academe that rival views of how society should organize itself have been contested but on the battlefields of Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Central America. To be sure, in each case, more than just economic ideologies were at stake. The guerrillas in Vietnam or Honduras would not have cared about, even if they had understood, the debates over the labor theory of value or other tenets of Marxian economics. Still beliefs in an alternative economic system that held promise of a better life in this world held sway over their actions no less than beliefs in alternative religious systems--as holding out the promise of eternal salvation in the next world--held sway over those who fought so fiercely in the religious battles in the aftermath of the Reformation. Those beliefs have been dealt a hard blow by the events in Eastern Europe during the past couple of years, particularly with the collapse of the Soviet government within the last year.
</p><p>But if we were to seek a date at which socialism ceased to be viewed as a viable alternative to capitalism, we have to look before the emancipation of the Eastern European countries in 1989. Besides, their rejection of socialism was as much a political statement, a rejection of an economic system that had been forced upon them by an occupier, as it was a statement about the virtues of that ideology. We must look, I think, to the privatizations within France beginning in the early 1980s, by an avowedly socialist government, reversing a pattern of nationalization which that government had instituted but a few short years before. There were inklings that the faith in the socialist ideology may have been crumbling in the years before: Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, another avowed socialist, took as one of the main goals of his government the "socialization of the nationalized enterprises," recognizing explicitly that the older view, that nationalizing an enterprise would ensure that the goals of the enterprise would be  coincident with "national interest," however that was defined, had no basis in reality, at least in the context of Greece. The collapse of socialism as an economic ideology was as remarkable in many ways as the almost contemporaneous collapse of the Soviet bloc, representing the culmination of an economic experiment of a half century's duration. It was an experiment that was conducted with considerable forethought, based as it was on an ideology of more than a century's standing. The ideology had withstood the scrutiny of time. Its premises and conclusions had been widely debated, and it included among its adherents some of the greatest minds over a period of more than a hundred years. Even today the Marxist ideas and ideals that underlay the economic ideology remain alive, not only within the third world but in other disciplines. A full and coherent account of the rise, persistence, and partial fall of this set of beliefs would be fascinating but would take me beyond the scope of these lectures. But one of the themes that I do hope to develop is that, indirectly and unintentionally, neoclassical models of the economy played a central role in promulgating and perpetuating a belief in market socialism--one of the central variants of the socialist model-- as an alternative to capitalism. I argue in these lectures that if the neoclassical model (or its precursors) had provided a correct description of the economy, then market socialism, would indeed have had a running chance of success. Thus the failure of market socialism serves as much as a refutation of the standard neoclassical model as it does of the market socialist ideal. In these lectures I attempt to explain more precisely what is wrong with that model and to provide the basic ingredients of an alternative paradigm.
</p><p>By most accounts the results of the experiment with socialism are unambiguous: The experiment was a failure. Like most social experiments it was not a controlled experiment, so there is controversy about exactly what inferences are to be made--to what extent were the basic ideas (if not the ideals) of socialism at fault and to what extent were the failures attributable to the manner in which the ideas were implemented, to what may be referred to as "specific design features"?" <br>

</p><p><p>Whither Socialism?</p>
</p><p>Joseph E Stiglitz
</p><p>The rapid collapse of socialism has raised new economic policy questions and revived old theoretical issues. In this book Joseph Stiglitz explains how the neoclassical, or Walraisian, model (the formal articulation of Adam Smith's invisible hand), which has dominated economic thought over the past half- century, not only may have provided an inadequate framework for understanding market economies but may have wrongly encouraged the belief that market socialism could work. Stiglitz proposes an alternative model, based on the economics of information, that offers greater theoretical insight into the workings of a market economy, further understanding into the failures of socialism, including market socialism, and clearer guidance for the setting of policy in transitional economies.
</p><p>Stiglitz sees the critical failing in the standard neoclassical model, and in models of market socialism derived from it, to be its assumptions concerning information, particularly its failure to consider the problems that arise from lack of perfect information and from costs of acquiring information. Going beyond the standard criticism centering on incentives and property rights, he also identifies problems arising from assumptions concerning completeness of markets and from the failure to focus on innovation. Stiglitz argues that not only has the existing paradigm failed to provide much guidance on the vital question of the choice of economic systems, the advice it has provided is often misleading. <br>

</ul><ul></ul>

<p>IN THE autumn of 1965 a group of intellectuals, most of them New Yorkers, launched a new journal called the<i> Public Interest</i>. Most of the group at the time would have called themselves liberals: Irving Kristol, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Daniel Bell, Seymour Martin Lipset and James Q. Wilson among them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By the magazine's tenth anniversary, Mr Moynihan was admitting that its adversaries now called its editors and writers not liberals, but "neo-conservatives". The senator himself has now moved closer to a liberal position again. Others, especially Irving Kristol, have become avowed conservatives, <i>tout court</i>. But what matters more than the intellectual trajectory of individuals is that the <i>Public Interest</i> suddenly made it respectable (for the first time since the appearance of the <i>New Republic</i> in 1914, it could be argued) for a New York intellectual to be something other than on the left.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Together with <i>Commentary</i> magazine, which started to move in a similar direction at about the same time, the<i> Public Interest</i> helped to change the political orientation of a large part of the American intelligentsia. That transformation has had vast consequences not just for the United States but for the world. Although, of course, a handful of intellectuals had this mighty influence only because millions of thoughtful Americans did not like what they saw when they looked at the effects of the liberal policies that were collectively intended to produce a "Great Society".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Liberal" in the United States had become a euphemism for "left" or "social democrat". The instinct of American liberals, in opposition under Eisenhower, and in government under Kennedy and Johnson, was invariably to send for government. You identified a problem. You called in the social scientists to propose a programme to solve it. You called on the government to finance the programme: and the desired outcome would result.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What the neo-conservatives began to say was exactly the opposite of this. There probably wasn't a problem. If there was, social scientists probably misunderstood it. It was probably insoluble, and in any case efforts on the part of government to solve it would probably make it worse. That is a caricature: but it expresses the essential nature of the intellectual revolution launched by the neo-conservatives, and what made a difference was that in general they were in the habit of making their case with intellectual rigour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet in a collection of essays, "What to Do About...", Norman Podhoretz, the editor of <i>Commentary</i> who took it to the right, reminds his readers that almost 50 years ago his own teacher, Lionel Trilling, had said that liberalism was "not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition" in America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Podhoretz reversed Trilling's proposition. Conservatism would now be the dominant, if not the sole intellectual tradition--were it not for the malign, vestigial hold on cultural institutions of "an intellectually necrotic class that is less and less able to provide a defence of its own ideas that seems persuasive to anyone but itself".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the past 20 years the neo-conservatives, helped by skilfully targeted foundation funding, have begun to create cultural institutions of their own: foundations, publishing houses, magazines, radio and television talk shows, journals, research institutes, think-tanks, some of them--like the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute, or the editorial page of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>--serious rivals to their once all-powerful liberal competitors. This has become, as Sidney Blumenthal put it, a "counter-establishment".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will success spoil American conservatism? A trawl through some recent books suggests that the conservative intellectual movement may be passing from its Golden to its Silver Age. Certainly neo-conservatism, now big business in publishing, seems to be showing a tendency to look back to past triumphs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One publisher, for example, has brought out Irving Kristol's essays as "Neo-Conservatism: The Autobiography of an Idea". (This identification of author and idea, by the way, is not as vainglorious as might be imagined: Mr Kristol's friend Daniel Bell once said, "that isn't neo-conservatism, that's just Irving!")
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another publisher has come out with "The Essential Neo-Conservative Reader", a compendium of the movement's sacred texts. And "What to Do About..." has essays from <i>Commentary</i> offering solutions by eminent neo-conservative pundits on topics such as abortion, education, health care, welfare and the like, predicated on the assumption that Newt Gingrich would be running America by now.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These are on the whole impressive volumes. Irving Kristol's autobiographical memoir is a fascinating account of an intellectual journey from left to right. "The Essential Neo-Conservative Reader" is a reminder that neo-conservatives may know one another, but that does not mean they agree. Compare, for instance, two essays in "The Essential Neo-Conservative Reader": Mr Podhoretz's "My Negro Problem--and Ours", with its conclusion that "the wholesale merging of the two races is the most desirable alternative", with the paper from Mr Moynihan, "The Negro Family: the Case for National Action", which, ironically, makes a classical liberal case for massive government action to restore the African-American family structure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other memorable milestones are Mr Moynihan's ringing <font size=-1>UN</font> speech denouncing the "Zionism is racism" resolution (1975), and the pioneering essay by Richard John Neuhaus and Peter Berger, "To Empower People" (1976), which restates the importance of "mediating structures"--neighbourhood, family, church--in resolving the dilemma of the welfare state: people want the benefits without the big taxes needed to deliver them. Both of these are also in "The Essential Neo-Conservative Reader".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You do not have to agree with all, or any, of these essays to be convinced that the neo-conservatives (as a loose, often divided group) did bring formidable intellectual energy to attacking some of modern society's most intractable problems. In a brief but penetrating foreword to "The Essential Neo-Conservative Reader", a criminologist, James Q. Wilson, explains how neo-conservatism evolved. At first, he says, neo-conservatives wrote "in reaction to the less plausible ideas of the Great Society". Since then, he notes, in the absence of an activist government, neo-conservatives have had even less to agree about.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He does identify some common ground. One is the neo-conservative belief in the Law of Unintended Consequences; the conviction, that is, that things in general, and government policies in particular, never work out quite the way they are meant to. Another is the idea that neo-conservatives (by implication, unlike liberal intellectuals) share the general convictions of the average American.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Running an eye farther along the shelf, you are reminded that not all neo-conservatives share this populist instinct. Just like "liberalism" a generation ago, "neo-conservatism" is in danger of becoming a brand image used to market some pretty cliquish products. For example, a volume called "Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing", edited by David Brooks, formerly of the editorial page of the<i> Wall Street Journal</i>, contains essays of varying quality on such subjects as the conservative attitude to dogs, the Washington property market, childbirth, child abuse and other columnists' favourites.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One does not have to be a sockless populist to notice that several of these essays are written by the children of men who spoke out as conservatives when that was a brave thing to do: son of Buckley, son of Kristol, son of Podhoretz. Many of these papers, too, spend a lot of energy on denigrating the rival brand, often in ways that, if put out on television, might violate the advertising code of conduct. William Kristol, for example, unsubtly compares liberals to communists in the Soviet Union.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sons of neo-conservatives call themselves conservatives. Neo-conservatism was the philosophy of a transitional generation, and the time has come, perhaps, for an audit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Several of the neo-conservative shibboleths belong in the debit column. Neo-conservatives bang on about a number of ideas which do not, perhaps, bear close examination. The Law of Unintended Consequences is not, after all, a scientific law, merely a clever name for a prejudice against government intervention. The End of Ideology means little more than "the end of all ideologies except this one". Another favourite neo-conservative slogan is "the New Class". Listed as members of the "New Class" by Irving Kristol are "...city planners, social workers, educators, criminologists, sociologists, public health doctors, and so on": a rather precise description, as it happens, of the founders of the <i>Public Interest</i>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The neo-conservatives can also be faulted for some polemical journalism dressed up as scholarship. They show, in particular, little awareness of the contradiction between the libertarian/free market stream of right-wing thinking and the authoritarian/traditionalist stream. More serious is the contradiction between their optimism about the United States when comparing it with other countries and their pessimism when considering the United States by itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet, this remarkable band of publicists did change the world. For what they did understand, to borrow the title of a very different conservative intellectual (the southern reactionary Richard Weaver), is that ideas have consequences. For better or worse, the ideas of the New York neo-conservatives have had consequences which include the decline of liberalism, the rehabilitation of capitalism and the respectability among intellectuals everywhere of the idea that socialism is dead. Not bad for a few founders of little magazines.

What to Do About
<p>The Children</p>
<p>WILLIAM J. BENNETT</p>
<p>William J. Bennett served as Secretary of Education under President Reagan and as director of National Drug Control Policy under President Bush. He is now co-director of Empower America and a John M. Olin Fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Among his recent books are The Book of Virtues and The De-valuing of America: The Fight for Our Culture and Our Children.</p>
<p> At the dawn of the 20th century there was every reason to believe that ours would be (in the tide of a best-selling book at the time) "the century of the child." From the early part of the 1900's through the 1950's, despite ups and downs, despite Depression and war, things got better in almost every area touching the welfare of American children: economic security improved, material earnings increased, medicine progressed, family structure was stable, children occupied a valued place in society, and our civic institutions were strong and resilient. In retrospect, it seems as if the midpoint of the century was a high point for the well-being of children.</p>
<p>By the 1960's, however, America began a steep and uninterrupted slide toward what might be called decivilization. Although every stratum of society has been affected, the worst problems have been concentrated within America's inner cities. No age group has remained untouched, but the most punishing blows have been absorbed by children.</p>
<p>In assessing conditions today, it is important to keep perspective: America is not in danger of becoming a third-world country; the vast majority of children do not live in sewers of disease and depravity; and most are not violent, sexually promiscuous, or drug-takers. At the same time, however, there is no question that as we approach the end of the last decade of this "American century," the condition of too many of our children is not good. The indicators are well known: low educational achievement, the decline of the two-parent family, moral confusion, and, for a sizable and increasingly large minority, abuse, neglect, and very bleak prospects for the future. </p>

An Autobiographical Memoir
<p>Is there such a thing as a "neo" gene? I ask that question because, looking back over a lifetime of my opinions, I am struck by the fact that they all qualify as "neo." I have been a neo-Marxist, a neo-Trotskvist, a neosocialist, a neoliberal, and finally a neoconservative. It seems that no ideology or philosophy has ever been able to encompass all of reality to my satisfaction. There was always a degree of detachment qualifying my commitment.</p>
<p>One "neo," however, has been permanent throughout my life, and it is probably at the root of all the others. I have been "neo-orthodox" in my religious views (though not in my religious observance). This is something of a puzzle to me, for my own religious background was not at all conducive to such a perspective. It is true that my parents' household in Brooklyn was Orthodox Jewish, but only in observance--belief seemed to have nothing to do with it. My father would go to synagogue only once a year, on the High Holidays; my mother never went, though she kept a strictly kosher household. We took notice of the other main Jewish holidays too, but we never "celebrated" them. I received absolutely no Jewish instruction at home, nor did my parents seem to care very much about my own observance. It is true that they dutifully sent me to an old-fashioned yeshiva--two afternoons a week and Sunday mornings--so that I could learn to read the prayer book and qualify for my bar mitzvah. There we also read the first five books of the Bible, translating from Hebrew into Yiddish--two langruages I didn't know. (My parents spoke Yiddish to each other, but only English to the children.) I dutifully participated, leaning to read the Hebrew and memorizing the Yiddish translations. Discipline was strict--if we misbehaved in any way, the rabbi would order us to stand up and then give us a stinging slap in the face. He also taught us to hate the goyim and to spit whenever we passed a church. </p>

l. Liberalism Confronts Simplicity
<p>In the 1950s, the liberal anti-Communists, later to be neoconservatives, were fierce opponents of Communism--which they believed to be a totalitarian evil, the irreconcilable enemy of any honest brand of liberalism. As the liberal anti- Communist editor Melvin Lasky wrote in 1952, "The historical uniqueness of Nazism should not blind us to the fact that morally and politically it is identical with Stalinism." These thinkers unleashed bitter condemnation of liberals whom they saw as blind to the great power of Communism to destroy liberalism. Irving Kristol published what is probably his most controversial essay, "Civil Liberties, 1952--A Study in Confusion," assailing liberals for choking on their greatest strength, tolerance, in approaching a dedicated adversary. He unleashed something of a fury in the intellectual world with words that would spark controversy for half a century: "For there is one thing that the American people know about Senator McCarthy: he, like them, is unequivocally anti-Communist. About the spokesmen for American liberalism, they feel they know no such thing And with some justification."</p>
<p>The liberal anti-Communists had no faith that liberalism would take the necessary steps to ensure its own survival. In a 1957 essay Norman Podhoretz accused liberalism of being unable to "take a sufficiently complicated view of reality," characterizing it as "a conglomeration of attitudes suitable only to the naive, the callow, the rash: in short, the immature. " The liberal anti- Communists considered the dominant branch of liberalism--what they sometimes called "revisionary liberalism" or "Doughface Progressivism"--to be an undignified, indeed dangerous philosophy for the leading nation in the West to entertain. Unable to condemn enemies on its Left when that enemy was as forthright an opponent as Communism, what would liberalism do with more subtle adversaries, those that made an effort to co-opt it? This mistrust of liberalism is evoked in numerous early neoconservative writings, but two from the early period of neoconservatism stand out as especially telling.</p>
<p>The first is Norman Podhoretz's "My Negro Problem . . . and Ours," an essay inspired by a discussion with James Baldwin that sparked a literary firestorm when published in February 1963. Though a supporter of civil rights from the beginning, Podhoretz explains--by recounting and interpreting childhood experiences--how little a political movement can accomplish in the arena of race relations. This essay is followed by a 1993 postscript and is slightly revised for this volume.</p>
<p>In a very different mode, Daniel Patrick Moynihan comes to a similar conclusion in "The Negro Family: The Case for National Action" widely known as the "Moynihan Report," published in 1965. In this controversial government document, Moynihan, then an aide to President Johnson, speaks of the cultural pathologies--rather than the political deprivations--that lay at the root of many of the problems of black America. </p>

"Nothing works" could have been the frustrated cry of the voters' movement
that swept the country in the midterm elections of November 1994, overturning
the Democrats' control of Congress. That movement has transformed the face
of American politics. Voters all over the country decided that the solutions put
in place by liberal policy-makers not only had ceased working but in many
cases had made matters worse.
<p>For decades, Commentary, one of the nation's most distinguished magazines of ideas, has taken the lead in criticizing liberal solutions. But what can and what will take their place? In 1994, months before there was any prospect of a political shift, the editors of Commentary commissioned the country's leading conservative thinkers to consider afresh the pressing issues of our day, with a view toward framing workable solutions and policies.</p>
<p>Crime, welfare, national defense, affirmative action, education, the arts, health care, the CIA, abortion, immigration, free speech, the children--in each of these areas, an expert who has lived with and studied the problem in depth reexamines it, analyzes what is wrong with the conventional way of approaching it, and then proceeds, boldly and succinctly, to propose "what to do about" it.</p>
<p>The definitive essays in this book, written by some of the most eminent figures on the American intellectual scene, are hard-hitting and fearlessly critical. They are also prescient, foreshadowing and setting the agenda for conservative politicians in the 1996 presidential campaign and beyond. </p>

Neoconservatism is the movement that has provided the intellectual foundation
for the resurgence of American conservatism in our time. And if
neoconservatism can be said to have a father or an architect, that person is
Irving Kristol.
<p>Kristol was an unlikely candidate for the mantle of a conservative leader. Schooled in radical socialism as a student at City College in the 1930s, Irving Kristol was soon disillusioned with the Left and thereafter rose swiftly to become an intellectual bulwark of the anticommunist movement. But he was much more than just an ideological foe of the Soviet Union. As an active editor and publisher, as well as a prolific writer in his own right, Kristol was instrumental in moving a generation of intellectuals to the conservative cause, and through them countless others.</p>
<p>Neoconservatism is the most comprehensive selection of Kristol's influential writings on politics and economics, as well as the best of his now-famous essays on society, religion, culture, literature, education, and--above all--the "values" issues that have come to define the neoconservative critique of contemporary life.</p>
<p>In the post-Cold War era, Kristol remains one of America's most prescient and important social critics. No narrow political partisan, Kristol champions pragmatic solutions to social problems while never straying from a deep grounding in ethics and religion. Whether addressing academic topics, crafting political strategy, or expounding on economics in the pages of The Wall Street Journal, Kristol writes with forceful clarity and ease; those who bemoan the disappearance of America's "public intellectuals" need look no further than this vital collection.</p>
<p>These essays provide an unparalleled insight into the 50-year development of Kristol's social and political ideas, from an uneasy socialism tempered with religious orthodoxy, to a vigilant optimism about the future of the American experiment. Those already familiar with Kristol's work will especially enjoy the new autobiographical essay that introduces this volume; it is sprinkled with personal recollections about such luminaries as Lionel Trilling, Leo Strauss, Saul Bellow, Sidney Hook, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and historian Gertrude Himmelfarb (who is also Mrs. Kristol). Those relatively new to Kristol's writings will be treated to some of the most lucid, insightful, entertaining, and intellectually challenging essays of our time. </p>

influential essays by its most noted figures--among them Irving Kristol,
Norman Podhoretz, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Gertrude
Himmelfarb, and James Q. Wilson.
<p>The word "neoconservative" was first used as a term of derision for disgruntled ex-liberals of the 1960s. Perhaps because of this, there has never been a central credo or organization unifying neoconservatism as a movement. With this collection, however, neoconservatism is cast in a new light, portrayed as a comprehensive outlook on economics, politics, society, and culture linked by common principles and a distinctive vision.</p>
<p>This anthology captures in the leading neoconservatives' own words the essence of this vision. Ranging in scope from the crisis in the black family to liberals' failure to grasp the importance of religion in America, some of the famous essays included here are Norman Podhoretz's "My Negro Problem--and Ours"; Irving Kristol's "Pornography, Obscenity, and the Case for Censorship"; Nathan Glazer's "The Campus Crucible"; and Daniel Patrick Moynihan's now legendary response to Idi Amin's infamous "Zionism Is Racism" resolution.</p>
<p>With a foreword by James Q. Wilson, this new anthology is both stimulating reading and a valuable historical compendium, destined to become the sourcebook for the history and ideas of neoconservatism. </p>

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Point of Crisis: the Bank and the Fleets
<p>The year 1797 by tradition is a dark year in British history. It was viewed as exceptional while it was under way. When The Annual Register shortly afterwards surveyed the events, it found them 'more striking and alarming than those of any year' in its four decades. "'Without were fightings, within were fears": Not only the British constitution trembled on the pivot of fortune, but the political balance of Europe.' The Register held Burkean overtones, as it had done from the start.' But this impression was very widely shared. Of course there had been plenty of alarms in recent times: in 1795, in the midst of dearth and discontent, Pitt was said to have expected 'a civil broil', and thanks largely to the subsequent measures there were fewer riots and meetings now. But the public events in I797 were of a different order. A year which saw a run on the Bank of England, two major mutinies in the fleets, the final collapse of an Allied Coalition, was exceptional indeed.</p>
<p>The sense of alarm was the keener because the events followed one another closely. The crisis for the Bank came in February, the mutinies lasted from April into June, Preliminaries of peace between France and Austria were signed at Leoben in April. The worst in point of fact was over, though it scarcely seemed so, in the middle of the year. Nor was the domestic danger in retrospect as great as it seemed at the time. The seamen's actions, if frightening, held their own constraints, and while the financial pressure was dramatic it proved not to have represented a basic economic threat. That does not mean that the crisis was unreal: its reality lay in the feeling of crisis, aroused easily enough in a period of uncertainty and growing doubt. For the state of the war as seen from London in the New Year was bleak. The attempt at peace talks, pursued since October, had failed in December, and the envoy Lord Malmesbury, sent packing from Paris, brought a tale of frustration when he dined with Pitt on the day of his return. Spain, once 1. The Annual Register. . .for the Searr7g7(17g8), iv.

Prussia, once an ally, was unreliably neutral. Our partners in Italy- Sardinia and the The Two Sicilies, which geographically meant Piedmont and Naples - had laid down arms, and the ports of convenience in Tuscany and Genoa were likewise under threat. By the end of January there was no British naval force in the Mediterranean. And of our two remaining allies, Russia seemed likely to stay on the sidelines, after some belated signals of effective co-operation; while Austria, the only real hope of a further Continental campaign, might need little more, despite some recent successes, to push her into a unilateral peace. '</p>
<p>If that were to happen, it would be the worst reverse so far. In the first place, it would undermine the chance of a joint Allied settlement. It would also mean that Britain would be confined to sustaining the war immediately by sea alone, which might well not be enough against a Power itself 'not possessing the command of the sea'. 'This country had never so successfully combated [France] as when its maritime strength had been aided by the judicious application of a land force on the continent'; and our own army, needing friendly bases in any case, could not carry the bulk of that burden. Such a strategy, which had finally crowned the last of our victorious wars, under Chatham, and to which his son had been turning, without much forethought, after the first year of the current war, appeared no less desirable as its prospects declined. If Austria withdrew, we would doubtless seek to resuscitate some action in Europe, presumably by turning once more to Russia and even Prussia. But the prospects in either case were hardly promising, our own attempts at landings had proved disastrous, and in the short term we would have to rely on blockade and colonial gains. This last policy would find some favour with the public, for a time; and also in some influential quarters, including now the Secretary of State for War, Henry Dundas. No doubt we could 'make our party good' on that basis. But the problems were evident. The neutral Baltic Powers, Sweden and Denmark, might think it wise to join the hostile combination, with serious effects on our naval supplies and capacity for blockade itself. And experience of operations in distant waters was mixed: the war in the East had gone satisfactorily on a minor scale, but expensive efforts in the West Indies had not produced lasting results and were notoriously severe in losses from disease. </p>

<p><b>Mexican economy</b></p>
<h2>Downgraded</h2><ul><li>T<font size=-1>HE</font> M<font size=-1>EXICAN</font> S<font size=-1>HOCK</font></a>&nbsp; By Jorge Castaeda.<br>
</ul>



<p>THERE are few more tragically compelling stories than the rise and abrupt fall of Carlos Salinas. Before he stepped down as Mexico's president in 1994 he had dominated the country's political stage with bold policies to open up a sheltered economy, culminating with the North American Free Trade Agreement (<font size=-1>NAFTA</font>). Then a bungled devaluation of the peso by his successors ruthlessly exposed the weaknesses in his legacy, and had central bankers fearing, briefly, for the stability of the world financial system. The United States stepped in, organising a $40 billion loan to bail Mexico out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today Mexico is suffering an economic slump, high unemployment and banking troubles. Its stability is threatened by political violence and drug trafficking. Mr Salinas himself is in exile as almost a fugitive, and prosecutors investigating cases of murder and embezzlement are questioning his jailed brother.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Officials in both Mexico and the United States think the tardiness of the devaluation, and political shocks, including assassinations and the Zapatista rebellion in Chiapas in 1994, go far towards explaining Mr Salinas's failures. They are confident that the Mexican economy will swiftly recover as Ernesto Zedillo, Mr Salinas's successor, persists with market-based economic policies (as the terms of the bailout require).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jorge Castaeda, a Mexican political scientist, disagrees. In this collection of essays, he argues that Mr Salinas's policies were doomed to fail--and so is the system of benevolent despotism that has kept the Institutional Revolutionary Party (<font size=-1>PRI</font>) in power for almost 70 years. The ex-president's liberal trade policies, and his obsessive search for foreign capital through <font size=-1>NAFTA</font>, are seen by Mr Castaeda as improvisations to maintain an over-valued exchange rate in order to placate Mexico's fractious middle class with cheap imported luxury goods. And he sees the shocks that rocked the Salinas regime in its final year as self-inflicted. The government, he says, swept away many of the <font size=-1>PRI</font>'s proven procedures for the settlement of conflicts among the political elite without replacing them with the modern representative democracy that Mexico needs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Castaeda's suggested alternatives to Mr Salinas's economic policies are half-baked, which is a pity because he is right about several important things. The failure of free-market policies to deliver much growth in Mexico (despite huge inflows of foreign money) before the devaluation should indeed worry policy-makers in Washington as much as it does those in Mexico city. So should the inequalities that persist in Latin America, and that Mr Castaeda thinks threaten the region's democracies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This study's conclusion is gloomy: with its weak, divided opposition Mexico is condemned to a slow decline of the existing system, accompanied by rising crime. Perhaps, but further instability could yet force change.

In this new biography, Donald Thomas reveals Lewis Carroll as a man who
faced what Robert Browning described as 'The Dangerous Edge of Things',
closer to the twilit underworld of psychopathology, crime and vice than his
admirers thought possible, yet closer still to the golden afternoon of
Wonderland.
<p>Despite the apparent seclusion of his life in an Oxford college, Lewis Carroll as the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson had strong political views and was unusually well informed about the vices of his age. He saw mid-Victorian London at its most raffish, while his library contained books on prostitution and the criminal underworld. He showed a sustained interest in law, crime and madness, counting the most eminent advocates and judges among his friends. Alice in Wonderland may appear as a spontaneous tale told on a summer afternoon. Donald Thomas shows it as the fruit of Dodgson's classical education and a reflection of momentous changes in mid-Victorian law and society.</p>
<p>Though a recluse in his later years, Dodgson in the 1860s was an inveterate theatre-goer, a friend of young actresses, a guest in the bohemia of the Pre- Raphaelites, and photographer of the famous. His summer months were spent in the elegance and comfort of the fashionableVictorian seaside.</p>
<p>This most paradoxical of Victorians was an opponent of vivisection and blood sports who teased his readers with the humour of cruelty. He was importunate in persuading 'little nudities' to pose before his camera, yet described any attempt to overcome their reluctance as 'a crime before God'. Dodgson, the anxious prude, left to the world the unfettered imagination of Lewis Carroll in Alice and The Hunting of the Snark. Within forty years of his death, his progeny had escaped the nursery to rub shoulders with Swift and Sade, Freud and Surrealism. </p>

<p><b>Charles Dodgson's alter ego</b></p>
<h2>A good likeness</h2><ul> <li><a href="9ex268.html">L<font size=-1>EWIS</font> C<font size=-1>ARROLL</a>:</font> <font size=-1>A</font> P<font size=-1>ORTRAIT</font> <font size=-1>WITH</font> B<font size=-1>ACKGROUND</font>.&nbsp;  By Donald Thomas. <br>
</ul>

<p>AFTER the compendious biography published last year by the Carroll authority, Morton Cohen, and another this summer by Michael Bakewell, readers might be forgiven for wondering--why another? And yet it could be argued that Lewis Carroll, or rather Charles Dodgson, was so odd a fish that the masses of material surrounding him--the thousands of letters, the nine volumes of diaries and scores of reminiscences--warrant several trawls.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Donald Thomas contends that Dodgson "is one of those figures who appear most clearly when seen against a background of the years through which he lived"--hence his title. This could probably be said of anybody, but it has the merit of letting the biographer off the psychological hook, which in Dodgson's case is perhaps best left to the men in white coats.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here was a man who took train journeys with games and puzzles to tempt chance-met ten-year-olds into conversation, and who brought safety pins to the beach to help them pin up their little skirts. At the end of his summers, he would make lists of his conquests, entering their names and ages and birthdays; he would beg kisses, hold hands, and send flirtatious letters with teasing threats of a good spanking. Any modern parent would have turned him in. But our age is at once too sophisticated and too crude.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dodgson was the soul of correctness, fondly recalled by his Beatrices and Violets as a fascinating and wholly unembarrassing friend. No child was ever coerced. Chaperones were always invited. Principle and religion governed his life, and he outdid even Mrs Grundy in spotting "coarseness". When he protested to the actress Ellen Terry that some stage business of hers had shocked his small companion, she retorted that she thought he only brought "nice" girls to the theatre.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In order to avoid the psychiatrist's chair, Morton Cohen was inclined to find Dodgson a pedestal instead. There he stands a little unconvincingly, a tragic figure burdened with a guilt he could neither name nor understand. Donald Thomas is cooler. He is less interested in Dodgson's paedophilia than in its special Victorian flavour: both innocent and coy, robust and sentimental, prudish and prurient.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inevitably, this biography often coincides with Mr Cohen's, down to the same quotations and anecdotes (though, oddly, Mr Thomas does not mention the earlier book). But it makes a real contribution in regrouping much of the material, making connections, opening it up. Dodgson's theatre-going is well known, but Mr Thomas threads his way through the West End streets, thick with whores, whose greeting, incidentally, was "Hello Charlie". He was a serious photographer, but Mr Thomas recalls that he shared the new art with the porn merchants whose shops he passed by.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This pervasive sense of contextual irony in Dodgson's life saves Mr Thomas's story from chronological fatigue. Towards the end he connects Mrs Grundy with an unwitting ally, Professor Krafft-Ebing, the exponent of the <i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i> science of sexual pathology. Society was becoming more knowing, and Dodgson's innocence more watchful. The celebration of Lewis Carroll by the French Surrealists, described in a fascinating chapter on his posthumous reputation, is somehow a fitting conclusion to the bizarre life of Charles Dodgson.

The Prisoner of Conscience
<p><ul> The little girl was walking along with her two sisters, when the clergyman, who was passing in a car, stopped beside her and invited her to get in. A few kilometers further on, he dragged her into a field, undressed her, and then photographed her. The kidnapper admitted having behaved with children in the neighbourhood in a similar way twice before.</ul></p>
<p>'I wonder how many people who knew something about Lewis Carroll thought of him when they read that,' wrote Jean Gattegno four years after the report of the incident, one of three in Sarthe and Mayenne, appeared in Le Monde in July 1972. 'Carroll's relationships with little girls undoubtedly represent the most sensitive problem his biographers have to tackle.'</p>
<p>The greater sensitivity belonged to the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, whose reputation on the evidence of such comments now lies somewhere between that of the public creator of Alice and the private admirer of Lolita. Even in photography, he was neither seducer nor intriguer, refusing to act against the wishes of parents or their daughters. Perhaps in a labyrinth of emotional compulsions there lay desires not essentially different to those of 'the clergyman, who was passing in a car'. If so, they were drilled into submission by conscience, conviction and intellect.</p>
<p>His true failings showed him to be as much a subject of his time as any man or woman a century later. He was, for example, a snob who described as 'roughs in the gallery' those unable to afford a seat in the theatre stalls where he sat. He was in public a political reactionary, who was awkwardly kind and humane in private. </p>

<h2>A<font size=-1>CCOUNTING</font> <font size=-1>FOR</font> G<font size=-1>ROWTH</font>.<br></h2>

The first edition of Accounting for Growth was published in 1992. Unusually
for a book on accounting, it made the bestseller lists and was engulfed in
controversy. It examined whether much of the apparently good corporate
performance of the 1980s was in fact the result of accounting sleight of hand,
and analysed twelve different techniques of 'creative accounting'.
<p>Each of the techniques was illustrated with extracts from the accounts of public companies, enabling readers to perform their own analysis. The protests from some of the companies identified led to Terry Smith's dismissal from his post as Head of UK Company Research with UBS Phillips and Drew.</p>
<p>Since that date the work of the Accounting Standards Board has closed the door on some of these methods, but creative techniques have been developed. This new edition, completely revised and with eight new chapters, looks at events since 1992 and gives readers an up to date guide to surviving as investors in the accounting jungle. </p>

<p>DAZED by depreciation? Perplexed by provisions? Then this guide, recently published in a revised second edition, is for you. In it, Terry Smith analyses in a concise and straightforward manner the ways in which British companies use "creative" accounting techniques. The first edition of the book, published in 1992, caused the heads of several big blue-chip firms cited in it to lose their tempers--and Mr Smith to lose his job as an analyst at a leading stockbroker in London. The latest version is unlikely to endear him to <font size=-1>UK</font> plc either.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unrepentant, Mr Smith argues that although new accounting standards in recent years have made it somewhat harder for companies to cook their accounts, there are still enough legal leftovers (and new ones appearing) to enable finance directors to "simmer" them. Among other things, he neatly dissects lawful but potentially misleading practices, such as using restructuring provisions to improve the appearance of a company's cashflow, and points to anomalies, such as the lack of a consistent standard for valuing brands. Hanson, Trafalgar House and <font size=-1>BTR</font> are among the firms whose accounts are shaken through his sieve.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are flaws in Mr Smith's approach. For instance, he states the obvious when he tells investors always to read the small print in company accounts and not to rely on a single financial ratio when assessing a firm's value. But this is nit-picking. His book is a boon for investors and a bane for bosses with something to hide.

<p>IN EXAMINING the powers of institutional investors in Australia and Britain, this lecturer in law at Melbourne University comes up with some modest but interesting ideas to make companies more accountable to their shareholders. He persuasively argues, for instance, that the listing rules of the London and the Australian stock exchanges should require all directors (ie, executive as well as non-executive ones) to be subject to retirement and re-election by rotation at least every three years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As provocatively, he also recommends that the rules of the two exchanges be amended to empower three-quarters of the co-directors to dismiss the directors of a listed company. Provisions against such sackings, he says, are inappropriate "given that it is now recognised widely that an important function of the board is to monitor--and thus, by implication, to make any necessary changes to the composition of--the executive management (which includes executive directors)". But, in the light of recent American regulatory experience, he is dubious about calls from the British Labour Party for shareholder voting by the trustees (or fund managers) of pension funds to be made compulsory.

<p>"WHILE Churchill might quote Disraeli...and John Kennedy might quote Tennyson, Leo Melamed quotes...Leo Melamed". Thus the chairman of a financial symposium in 1988 introducing the man who considers himself the progenitor of the world's financial futures markets. Mr Melamed has many qualities, but modesty is not one of them, as this autobiography demonstrates. Nor is brevity. Even though he has had the help of an experienced journalist, he often uses ten words where one would do.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That said, Mr Melamed's book contains some fascinating insights into the markets that he helped create while chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (he retired in 1991). Intriguingly, he is worried about the risks that a few convoluted trading strategies involving futures and options could pose to financial stability. Coming from the "father of financial futures", that is a warning financial folk would be foolish to ignore.

<p>WINSTON CHURCHILL once referred to Russia as "a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma". Students of financial markets feel much the same way about Warren Buffett, the boss of Berkshire Hathaway, an American investment firm that owns stocks in firms engaged in an eclectic range of industries. Roger Lowenstein provides some clues for solving the riddle and unwrapping the mystery that surrounds one of the world's greatest investors. But at the end, its subject remains an enigma.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Buffett fascinates because Berkshire Hathaway has consistently outperformed the stockmarket by picking "undervalued" equities. This flies in the face of "efficient market theory"--a belief among financial economists that, at any given moment, all the publicly available information about a company is reflected in its share price. On this view, those investors who do manage to outperform the market are lucky rather than skilful.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Lowenstein, however, argues that Berkshire Hathaway's success has more to do with judgment than luck. As well as a knack for spotting undervalued stocks, Mr Buffett has an uncanny eye for spotting talented individuals who run their firms as if they were owners, not just managers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of this is well known to those who peruse Berkshire's annual reports, which Mr Buffett uses to convey his investment wisdom in a witty and self-deprecating style. Less well known is the personal history that shaped this philosophy. Thus the book probes Mr Buffett's past to find out what makes him tick. The picture that emerges is of a self-absorbed genius, who sometimes appears emotionally detached from his family; of a creature of habit, who is unwilling to experiment with the unfamiliar; and of an outsider who prefers to work from Omaha, Nebraska, rather than Wall Street. In short, if Mr Lowenstein is right, the secret of Mr Buffett's success may well have more to do with the man than his methods.

A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE PUBLISHERS
<p>Hollow vessels make the greatest sound Anon</p>
<p>That plus 10 cents and you get a ride on the subway New Yorkers' saying</p>
<p>It may help to bring readers up to date about this book if I begin with some of the extraordinary events in the summer of 1992. After the original research report in early 1991, preparation of the book and publication went ahead uneventfully and do not deserve comment. It was not publication that caused the excitement in 1992, but the attempts to suppress the book completely.</p>
<p>I have already explained in the first edition how I was prompted to write the book by the even more extraordinary events in the UK economy and stock market in 1990-92. In my opinion, these events were due to more than just the impact of a ferocious recession given additional impetus by the reaction to events in Kuwait in the summer of 1990. UK quoted companies had begun to drop like ninepins, and I was struck by the extent to which investors, even professional fund managers and analysts, were quite naive in thinking that published company accounts were in some way a protection against losing money in this maelstrom. I am producing a second and updated edition because I am not much less impressed by their naivete today, as you will see from the BTR example which I quote in Chapter 4 and on page 189.</p>
<p>I wrote the book in a particular format: with lots of examples taken from company accounts. There had been works on creative accounting before, such as Ian Griffiths' Creative Accounting but they had generally failed to name names, relying instead upon using examples of 'Company A' and 'Company B'. I felt that readers should be able to use the book to look at live (and dead) company examples in order to give them a realistic guide as to what to look for. This presented an obvious problem. </p>

The Corporate Governance Systemsin the UK and Australia
<p>A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This book contrasts the role of institutional shareholders in corporate governance in the United Kingdom and Australia. Corporate governance is the system by which companies are directed and controlled. 9 The companies of present concern are quoted public companies. The comparative aspect of the book is novel: the UK system of corporate governance has (along with that of the US) been contrasted commonly with the systems of continental European countries (especially Germany) and Japan, but not with that of Australia. The UK and US corporate sectors are characterized by a relatively large number of quoted companies, a liquid capital market where ownership and control rights are traded frequently, and few inter-corporate equity holdings. The corporate sectors of Germany and Japan are, in contrast, characterized by a relatively small number of quoted companies, an illiquid capital market where ownership and control rights are traded infrequently, and many intercorporate shareholdings. As a result, the UK and US corporate sectors have 'outsider' systems of corporate governance, whilst the German and Japanese systems of corporate governance are 'insider' systems. The Australian corporate sector has traditionally been considered to possess the same basic characteristics as those of the UK and the US, and the Australian system of corporate governance is regarded as an outsider </p>

This book examines the role of institutional shareholders in corporate
governance, which is the system by which companies are directed and
controlled. This is a subject of great concern to public companies, their
management, their shareholders and their employees. The recent concern about
the effectiveness of corporate governance in a number of different countries has
produced an outpouring of books and other publications including the Report of
the Cadbury Committee in the UK. The unusual feature of this book is that it
compares the system of corporate governance operating in Australia with that
operating in the UK, while at the same time also looking carefully at US,
German and Japanese experiences. The significance of the subject matter of
this book lies in the fact that institutional investors collectively hold a very
large proportion of the equity capital of the UK corporate sector and a sizeable
proportion of the equity capital of the Australian equivalent. In addition
domestic companies occupy an extremely significant position in the UK
economy and a significant one in the Australian economy. How these
companies are directed and controlled is of very great significance to the
economies of these countries.

Peace and War
<p>Aboard a screaming train somewhere in Siberia, I learned my first lesson in strategy. I was eight years old, peering over the shoulder of my father who had encouraged me to do so. He was engrossed in a game of chess. His opponent was a brooding old man with hunched shoulders and long white fingers constantly stroking a bushy gray beard. Slowly the old man shifted forward in his seat, muttering to himself and showing a measure of passion.</p>
<p>"Shach!" he blurted in Yiddish as his knight snatched a pawn checking my father's king. The pause seemed forever. My father sat there, he later explained to me, searching for the best strategy between three options.</p>
<p>I do not remember how my father countered or who claimed victory. What struck me, however, was the calmness of the men and their focus as each methodically took his turn. They did not seem to hear the rattle of the train's wheels that vibrated through the car's frail underbelly. Nor were they bothered by the sleet slamming against the windows, then moving slowly down in rivulets.</p>
<p>Looking back to that day in late 1940, the scene seems almost surreal: Two men playing chess, leisurely pondering each move as if they had all the time in the world, nowhere to go, and nothing to worry about except the chess game when, in fact, time was quickly running out. We were a train of nomads driven by a sense of survival, escaping for our lives from the Nazis. Ironically, we were pawns in someone else's game.</p>
<p>The scourge that had swept Europe turned everything upside down, severing the tether of genes, language, ideas, and ideologies and sending families like mine into exile. We were among the fortunate ones. The main part of my family was still together--my mother, father and I--and we were healthy though sometimes cold and hungry. I wondered about my grandmothers, my favorite Aunt Bobble, and friends who had stayed behind in Bialystok, unwittingly taking their chances with what the gods of war had to offer. </p>

He is one of the most powerful figures in the world of finance-- a visionary
who pioneered the modern futures industry and launched the International
Monetary Market (IMM). Yet, Leo Melamed was not born to wealth and
influence. His is an extraordinary rags-to-riches tale of intelligence, drive,
savvy, timing, and the overpowering force of a uniquely charismatic
personality. Now the inside story of the remarkable life and career of Leo
Melamed is revealed in this long-awaited autobiography.
<p>A Holocaust survivor, Leo Melamed had barely begun the first grade in 1939 when he and his parents fled their native Poland one step ahead of the oncoming Nazi juggernaut. Crossing Siberia en route to a brief stay in Japan-- just months before Pearl Harbor--the family arrived in the United States to begin life anew. They settled in Chicago, where young Leo became a product of the inner city and embraced his new country and its culture.</p>
<p>Seeking part-time employment while attending law school, Leo Melamed answered a classified ad that would change his life. Hired by what he presumed was a law firm named Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Bean, he found himself on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. "I was Alice stepping through the Looking Glass into a world of not just one Mad Hatter, but hundreds. The shouting among the traders, the movement of their bodies and hands, captivated me like nothing before . . . there was a life force on that .floor that was magical and exciting, and though I didn't understand what was going on, I wanted to be a part of it. "</p>
<p>Leo Melamed became much more than just a part of it. From modest beginnings as a pork belly trader, he led the Chicago Merc for the next quarter of a century, introducing finance to an industry that was the exclusive domain of agriculture. As his reputation as a financial genius grew, so did the tales of his larger-than-life personality. In Leo Melamed: Escape to the Futures, you'll meet the man behind the legend. Written with the assistance of award winning journalist Bob Tamarkin, this enthralling memoir deftly weaves intimate personal details with behind-the-scenes accounts of some of the most momentous financial events of our century--including Leo's role as advisor to the White House after the Hillary Rodham Clinton cattle futures trading episode. You'll read fascinating accounts of his dealings with political powerhouses like Bob Dole, Tip O'Neill Dan Rostenkowski, and others. Offering penetrating insights into the workings of a multibillion dollar industry, this is a story that has as much to say about human nature as it does about the nature of today's markets.</p>
<p>Hailed as both hero and tyrant, Leo Melamed is undeniably one of the most colorful and intriguing personalities of our time. This intimate, revealing personal account is not to be missed. </p>

OMAHA
<p><ul> Like a diamond set in emerald, gracing the west bank of the Missouri River, lies Omaha, the wonder city of the West and marvel of enterprise, ability, and progressiveness. </ul> TELEPHONE COMPANY PROMOTION, 1900</ul></p>
<p>Almost from the day that Dr. Pollard awakened him to the world, six pounds strong and five weeks early, Warren Buffett had a thirst for numbers. As a boy, he and his friend Bob Russell would pass an afternoon on the Russells' front porch, which overlooked a busy intersection, recording the license-plate numbers of passing cars. When the sky darkened, they would go inside and spread open the Omaha World-Herald, counting how often each letter appeared and filling entire scrapbooks with progressions of numbers, as though they held the key to some Euclidean riddle. Often, Russell would reach for the almanac and read out a list of cities. One by one, Warren would spit back the populations. "I'd say a city, he'd hit it on the nose," Russell would recall, half-a century later. "I might say, 'Davenport, Iowa; Topeka, Kansas; Akron, Ohio.' If I gave him ten cities, he'd hit every one." Baseball scores, horse-racing odds-- every numeral was fodder for that precocious memory. Combed, scrubbed, and stuffed into a pew of Dundee Presbyterian Church, Warren would pass the time on Sundays calculating the life spans of ecclesiastical composers. He would stand in the living room with a paddle and ball, counting, counting by the hour. He would play Monopoly for what seemed forever--counting his imagined riches. </p>

Starting from scratch, simply by picking stocks and companies for investment,
Warren Buffett of Omaha, USA has amassed one of the epochal fortunes of the
twentieth century--an astounding net worth of $10 billion, and counting. If you
had been among the lucky few who invested $10,000 with him in 1956, your
original investment would be worth $80 million today. That awesome figure
has made him a cult figure popularly known for his seeming contradictions: a
billionaire who lives a modest lifestyle, a phenomenally successful investor
who eschews the revolving-door trading of the modern Wall Street, a brilliant
deal-maker who cultivates a homespun aura.
<p>But just who is the 'Oracle of Omaha', and why is he so successful? In his illuminating biography, Roger Lowenstein draws on three years of unprecedented access to Buffett's family, friends, and colleagues to provide the first definitive account of the life and career of this American original. Buffett reveals a man whose conscientiousness, integrity, and good humour exist alongside an odd emotional isolation. It shows how Buffett's investment strategy--a long-term philosophy grounded in buying stock in companies undervalued on the market and hanging on until their worth invariably surfaces --is a reflection of his inner self.</p>
<p>Intelligent and offbeat, Buffett was obsessed with moneymaking from childhood. His parents were demanding but instilled in him self-reliance and honesty (particularly his stockbroker/politician father). As an undergraduate, Buffett knew as much about economics as his teachers did--but at Columbia Business School he met Professor Ben Graham, whose investment philosophy he adopted and then improved on with his own particular genius. Buffett masterfully traces its subject's life: his enormously successful partnership, his early inspired investments in American Express and Geico, his investment in the Washington Post and friendship with its owner Kay Graham, his unique relationship with his mutually friendly wife and mistress, his rescue of the scandalridden Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>Lowenstein paints Buffett as the antithesis of the reckless mentality that fuelled the financial debacle on Wall Street at the end of the 1980s, and shows him to be a man on a lifelong search for stability and security. In outlining the character traits and the financial philosophy that made Buffett the richest man, Bufett presents a landmark portrait of a uniquely American life. </p>

</p><p>The Deutsche Bank from its Founding to the Great War <br> 1870-1914
</p><p>by Lothar Gall I. Beginnings <br> I. Founding
</p><p>Chairos - a moment favoured by the gods; that was what the ancient Greeks used to call a situation in which plans and opportunities for their realization, future expectations and present circumstances came together in a way that not only promised success but virtually guaranteed it. That kind of chairos must, it seems in retrospect, have prevailed at the beginning of 1870, when a small group of men who combined business experience with enormous enterprise decided to set up a German export bank based in Berlin. Following the political revolution of 1848-49 (a failure, but one that had imparted great momentum to historical development), what we call the Industrial Revolution had come to embrace broader and broader areas of the central European economy. The expansion and internal consolidation of the German Customs Union (founded in 1834) in part provided the basis for this, as did liberalization of the law as it related to the economy (for example, by making it easier to set up joint stock companies), the spread of the principles of freedom of trade beyond the confines of Prussia, and the country's adhesion, during the 1860s, to the west European free-trade zone created by the Cobden Treaty of 1860. In the wake of Prussia's victory over Austria in 1866, the resultant dissolution of the German Confederation, and the creation of a federal state uniting the northern part of Germany, the conflicts surrounding the redrawing of the political map of central Europe aspired to a final decision - even though it was not yet entirely clear what that map would look like and above all how it was going to come about. The self-confidence of the German middle class, despite many a political setback since the abortive revolution of 1848, was growing steadily, along with its economic strength and the social influence that that class was simultaneously acquiring as a result of an increasingly dominant position in the law, in government, and in science and education. Ludwig Bamberger, one of the co-founders and political advisers of what was to become the Deutsche Bank, boldly pronounced Bismarck at the time to be involuntarily paving the way for the efforts of the liberal-oriented middle classes, which would soon achieve political victory on the foundation that Bismarck had laid as well.
</p><p>The basis of Bamberger's prophecy was the politically useful alliance that Bismarck had forged after 1866 with the right wing of the very party that he had so passionately opposed hitherto, namely with the National Liberals. The domestic political consequences of that alliance made themselves felt first in northern Germany, in the so-called North German Confederation, where they produced a positive thrust towards modernization in virtually all areas of economic and social life, a thrust that saw most of the remaining restrictions on trade and industry fall away. The result was to impart even greater momentum to an economy that could already look back on almost two decades of sustained boom conditions, and to create a mood of general expectation and adventure, since what German historians have dubbed the Grunderzeit (the 'flotation years' of rapid industrial expansion; Tr.) in fact began in the second half of the 1860s rather than 'after 1871' (the usual starting point assigned to the period).
</p><p>Just as the high hopes and venturesomeness of contemporaries, mainly among the middle class but also far beyond that segment of society, were particularly directed during those years towards establishing a national state, so too did those contemporaries, even the professed free-traders among them, quite naturally tend to see and conceive of the economy and economic life in such categories. The terms on almost everyone's lips were 'Volkswirtschaft' and 'Nationalokonomie'. So what could be more appropriate than to establish, for the purpose of financing Germany's foreign trade, which until then had been handled essentially by British and French banks, a German bank domiciled in the capital of the supreme power (Prussia) of the German Customs Union and of the old North German Confederation - with the prospect of also assuming other financial functions in what was clearly so egregiously prosperous an economy? <br>

</p><p>
</p><p>The Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest universal bank, celebrates its 125th anniversary in 1995. To mark thc occasion, it has asked five leading scholars to write its history. In close co-operation with the Deutsche Bank's Historical Archives, the authors have produced a work of milestone importance in business history.
</p><p>The work is primarily the story of a company. It traces the Deutsche Bank's evolution into a big bank, its positioning as a foreign trade and 'industrial' bank, and also its big international financing projects in East Asia, the Ottoman Empire and America, with all their foreign policy implications during the German Empire. It describes the bank's situation and business policy from the period of high inflation after the First World War to the world economic and banking crisis at the end of the Weimar Republic. The company's activities under the National Socialist dictatorship and the treatment of Jewish staff and customers are looked at in the same detail as banking business during the Second World War. The book documents the splitting-up of the bank and its reamalgamation after 1945 under Allied occupation policy and its emergence as today's international financial conglomerate. Furthermore, it portrays the leading bank managers, the changes in staff as well as the new directions in organizational structure, and shows the company's position in the banking landscape at different points in time.
</p><p>The book is also a contribution to the economic and social history of modern Germany, as the bank's progress is closely linked to the development of the economy and social change. The authors describe the Deutsche Bank's relations with German industry and the central banks of the time, as well as showing how the company responded to new demands from a society in flux.
</p><p>Finally, the history of the Deutsche Bank is inextricably involved with Germany's political history. 'The fiftieth anniversary, in 1920, took place in the context of a recently lost war and a revolution, a depreciating currency, and a very uncertain future. . . The seventy-fifth anniversary in the spring of 1945 was even more miserable and might well have been its last. That there would be a one hundredth anniversary of a reunited Deutsche Bank ... in 1970 was anything but predictable in the years immediately following the end of the Second World War, and there was no reason to think in 1970 that the Deutsche Bank would be celebrating its 125th anniversary with reopened branches in what was formerly the GDR.' (Gerald D. Feldman)
</p><p>Seldom is a major company privileged to have its history documented by such outstanding scholars, and never before have authors been given such generous access to sources of material - all for the reader's benefit. You have here the distinctive features of a successful company history: the general derived from the specific and the specific illustrating the general. This book makes banking history more exact and, at the same time, more vivid. The result is a work of equal interest to bankers and economists, to historians and to the many readers who believe that a knowledge of banking is today an essential part of political culture. <br>

<p><b>German banking</b></p>
<h2>Never idle</h2><ul><li><a href="3ex28.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> D<font size=-1>EUTSCHE</font> B<font size=-1>ANK</font></a>: <font size=-1>1870-1995</font>&nbsp; By Lothar Gall, Gerald Feldman, Harold James, Carl-Ludwig Holtferich &amp; Hans B&uuml;schgen.<br>
</ul>



<p>THIS huge volume exemplifies much of what is best in modern Germany: a lofty objective addressed with deep seriousness and with the deployment of resources on an enviable scale. Written by four dons under the direction of a professor of business at Cologne, this is no standard corporate pot-boiler. The narrative divides naturally at four watersheds: 1914, 1933, 1945 and, less familiarly, 1957, the date of the Bundesbank Act.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The hot potato in this vast enterprise was clearly the Nazi period. In 1970, when Deutsche Bank last took stock of its past, it was judged too soon after 1933-45 to attempt any sort of comprehensive treatment. The passage of a further quarter century and the deaths of nearly if not quite all of those personally involved--including that of Hermann Abs, spokesman (in effect, head) of the bank in 1957-67, but already a senior director of it in the early 1930s--have together at last made possible a thorough and independent study. Time has helped in other ways. On unification in 1990, 12,000 files in Potsdam were returned to the bank, whence they came under the eye of Harold James, a British historian selected to cover the period of Nazi rule.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was this section, naturally enough, which aroused the most interest when the German edition of this book was published a year ago. For Mr James muffles but does not mince his words. Making every allowance for the pressures put upon its directors and scrupulously avoiding the role of Recording Angel, he has some necessary things to say about the bank under Hitler.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two examples must suffice: "The Bank became part of the machine of German imperialism, and its employees the agents of a brutal political process"; and, as to Abs's seat on the supervisory board of I.G. Farben, "We do not know whether this body discussed the establishment of a plant in Birkenau, using labour from the concentration and annihilation camp at Auschwitz. Might he not have wondered about what was going on?"
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Few pages can match for power and immediacy the letter sent to the chairman of the supervisory board, Franz Urbig, by the then spokesman of the board of directors on April 9th 1933. Born into the Jewish religion, but baptised, Georg Solmssen was well placed to judge, and to denounce as he does in this letter, both the true objectives of the Nazi leaders and the shameful silence and lack of solidarity shown by the bank towards its Jewish staff. At the launch of this book in Frankfurt last spring the management team of 1995 made it clear, in answer to some awkward questions, that while the historians were free to say what they wished, the bank had no intention of saying anything more.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At various times, the bank was criticised within Germany for being too Jewish, too Catholic, too cosmopolitan, too left-of-centre, too influential, too haughty, too big. A mainly American catalogue of accusations in 1945 comically mirrors an earlier Nazi charge-sheet. Whoever might be in power in Berlin, the bank needed to be vigilant in its own defence. The tactics had to vary, which might mean, for example, that one or two "token" Nazis were elected to the board--but all for banking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Deutsche Bank these days looks proof against anything, including its own mistakes. Its embrace includes the great names of German industry--<font size=-1>BMW</font>, Daimler-Benz, Mannesmann, Siemens. Its personalities have often mattered, and the murder of Alfred Herrhausen by German terrorists in 1989 was an irreparable loss. As for Abs, he flits through these pages for more than 60 years, now taking the longest of spoons to sup with the German resistance, now escaping from war-torn Berlin in a delivery van belonging to the Karstadt department store, now fending off the accusation that he multiplied his income by ten between 1933 and 1945, now tactfully retiring like Cincinnatus to his fruit farm at Remagen, but always in demand and never idle--like the bank itself.

<p><b>Devil's biography</b></p>
<h2>From bad to worse</h2><ul><li>T<font size=-1>HE</font> O<font size=-1>RIGIN</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> S<font size=-1>ATAN</font></a>&nbsp; By Elaine Pagels.<br>
</ul>

<p>SATAN was a late developer. In the earliest books of the Bible little is heard of him and he is an obedient fellow. In Hebrew the <i>satan</i> is merely a servant of God who performs his service by obstructing human mischief. He acts as an adversary, but on God's behalf. It was, for instance, Satan who stood in the path of Balaam's ass in order to prevent Balaam going where God did not want him to go--though new translations of this episode refer to an "angel of the Lord", thus erasing the traces of the devil's honest youth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This original Satan did admittedly have a tricky side to him, which is perhaps not surprising given his line of work. In "Job" it was he who suggested putting the old man to the test. Yet he did so strictly within the limits approved by the boss. The evil arch-rebel found in Christian and some later Jewish writers was as yet nowhere in sight.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It seems, Elaine Pagels says, that real rebelliousness began to set in around the 7th century <font size=-1>BC</font>, when some Jewish scribes gave Satan a more sinister role in order to explain divisions in the house of Israel. How could David, the rightful king of the Jews, have imposed his unpopular poll-tax? He must, it was said, have been under the influence of a mischievous being.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly, writers who described the strife among Jews after the Maccabean revolt in the 2nd century <font size=-1>BC</font> cited an enemy of God who had fomented apostasy. This explained how even Jews could go badly wrong. Thus Jewish groups used the figure of Satan to recast their sectarian conflicts as battles between good and evil--that is, to demonise their opponents. Christians then inherited a Satan whose name could be invoked to make demons of their adversaries: pagans, heretics and, perhaps most consequentially for European history, the Jews who had invented him in the first place.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is the tale enthrallingly told by Ms Pagels, a professor of religion at Princeton who is best known for her work on the secret gospels discovered at Nag Hammadi in Egypt in 1945. Her strategy makes sense. When Satan is seen in the setting of an evolving religion, his development from servant to fiend becomes comprehensible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the turmoil of 1st-century Palestine, she presents the gospels as a species of campaigning propaganda. St Mark, for example, wanted to let the Romans off the hook in order to redirect the blame for Jesus Christ's death on to the unconverted Jews; it was they and not the Romans who were the immediate ideological rivals of the first Christians. The later gospel-writers, particularly the gentile St Luke, warmed to this theme. St John went so far as to make Jesus himself condemn the Jews as Satan's offspring. St Matthew was more eager to establish Jesus's claim to be the prophesied king of the Jews, so he tended to demonise not all of the nation of Israel but just recalcitrant factions of it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By the 2nd century it was no longer the case that most Christians were converted Jews. The challenge was no longer unconverted Judaism but paganism. It was the spirits pagans worshipped who had to be identified as the creatures of Satan. These <i>daimones</i> became for Christian writers "vile demons". The notion of the demonic developed the unambiguous connotation of evil that it bears today.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There has always been much more to evil than the political dimension explored by Ms Pagels. But that dimension is far from being just history. Consider the words of a preacher at a Republican Party caucus in Louisiana on February 6th: "We knew Pat [Buchanan] could not lose, because God is looking for a man who will stand up...against the Devil's man now in the White House." Such vilification of a foe is not, as the liberal-minded may think, an absurd misuse of the notion of Satan. It is, Ms Pagels argues, largely what Satan was invented for.

</p><p><p>Chapter I</p>
</p><p>Pueblo to Stanford
</p><p>AS WE GET OLDER we have the opportunity to look back over many years and see how certain events, seemingly unimportant at the time, had a profound effect in shaping our business or professional careers.
</p><p>In my own case there were two such events. One occurred in the summer of 1929 when I was given a tour of Stanford University. This introduction to Stanford led to my decision to attend the university. The second event, related to the first, was becoming acquainted with Professor Fred Terman at Stanford. It was Fred who sparked my interest in electronics and who later encouraged and helped Bill Hewlett and me go into business for ourselves. His interest and faith in our abilities, even at our young age and in the midst of the Great Depression, gave us confidence and helped set a course for us.
</p><p>I was born in Pueblo, Colorado, in 1912. My father was a lawyer and my mother a high school teacher. They met at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, and after they were married they moved to Pueblo, which was my father's home. My younger sister, Ann Louise, was born in 1915.
</p><p>Pueblo in 1912 resembled less a midwestern farm community than it did a western frontier city or border town. There was a steel mill and several foundries that smelted ore from Leadville and other mines in the Rocky Mountains to the west. Pueblo was tough and violent, with immigrant workers, a few gangsters, and lots of brothels and saloons. Street fights and shootings were not uncommon.
</p><p>We lived on the north side of the city right next to the prairie. I could cross the street in front of our house and find horned toads (which are almost extinct today) and wild onions and cactus, which often gave shelter to rattlesnakes.
</p><p>We could look across the prairie and see Pikes Peak about fifty miles to the north, and about thirty miles to the west, the Wet Mountain Range. I spent many hours roaming the prairie, sometimes with childhood friends, sometimes alone, until my high school years, when studies and school activities consumed most of my time. But in those early years of roaming, my love of nature was born.
</p><p>One of my early recollections of Pueblo was the great flood of 1921. I recall going downtown with my father and seeing mud about four feet deep. Another memorable sight was a railroad boxcar stuck in the second floor window of one of the main buildings. <br>

</p><p>
</p><p>In the fall of 1930, David Packard left his hometown of Pueblo, Colorado, to enroll at Stanford University. There, he befriended another freshman, Bill Hewlett.
</p><p>After graduation from college, Hewlett and Packard decided to throw their lots in together. They tossed a coin to decide whose name should go first on the notice of incorporation, then cast about in search of products to sell.
</p><p>Today, the one-car garage in Palo Alto that housed their first workshop is a California historic landmark: the birthplace of Silicon Valley. And Hewlett- Packard has produced thousands of innovative products for millions of customers throughout the world. Their little company employs 98,400 people and boasts constantly increasing sales that reached $25 billion in 1994.
</p><p>While there are many successful companies, there is only one Hewlett-Packard. Because from the very beginning, Bill and Dave had a way of doing things that was contrary to the prevailing management strategies. In defining the objectives for their company, Packard and Hewlett wanted more than profits, revenue growth, and a constant stream of new, happy customers. For them, business success also included:
</p><p>- A focus on fields of interest in which innovative, meaningful contributions were possible <br> - A dedicated, fairly compensated workforce and a working environment that fostered intense individual creativity <br> - A company wide commitment to community involvement
</p><p>Yet even these objectives don't quite tell the whole story. Hewlett-Packard's success owes a great deal to other factors: openness to change, an unrelenting will to win, the virtue of sustained hard work. As a result, HP is now universally acclaimed as the world's most admired technology company; its wildly successful approach to business has been immortalized as The HP Way.
</p><p>In this book, David Packard tells the simple yet extraordinary story of his life' work and of the truly exceptional company that he and Bill Hewlett started in a garage fifty-five years ago. <br>

<p>OUTSTANDING companies are scrutinised in "Built to Last" to find the secrets of their success. The 18 companies are drawn from a wide range of industries, but all are durable (their average age is over 90) and profitable (their shares have done far better than the stockmarket generally since 1926). The authors argue that what marks these companies out is not charismatic leadership (most have been led by unremarkable people) or even revolutionary products but a core ideology. This gives them a cult-like character. They transform their recruits into company clones (anybody who fails to conform is ruthlessly expelled). They promote almost exclusively from within, and are contemptuous of management fads.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Built to Last" is full of vivid examples and intriguing insights. It is marred only by its authors' fondness for such ghastly phrases as "big, hairy audacious goals". There are enough bad writers about management without good writers pretending to be bad ones.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For an insider's look at one of these model companies you cannot do better than read David Packard's account of how, starting with just $538 and a rented garage in Palo Alto, California, he and Bill Hewlett created not only a computer giant but also Silicon Valley. His formula for success is to think small, avoid fancy business-school models and cultivate small-town values.</td></tr></table>

<p>THOUGH highly fashionable, introducing a more flexible pay system has been anything but smooth. In many cases flexibility does more to depress the unlucky many, who feel that they are being undervalued, than it does to motivate the lucky few, who feel that they are at last getting their just deserts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, few companies are tempted to go back to the old ways. Jobs and occupational hierarchies are now less rigid and the ideal of linking pay to a person's performance rather than his position remains appealing. The trick is to introduce flexibility sensitively.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The three authors, who all work for the Hay Group, a management consultancy, advise employers to adapt pay policies to their company's culture. They identify four different types of company. Functional organisations, which stress reliability and routine, need pay systems that attract reliable types. Process organisations, which are close to their customers, should emphasise equal pay within teams but encourage differences between teams. Time-based organisations, which stress flexibility and speed, should use performance-related rewards. Network organisations, which thrive on alliances and ventures, should pay people according to what they bring to each project. This usually means paying a few stars far more than the rest.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This analysis ignores the way that pay can be used to transform cultures--for example, how Britain is using merit pay to introduce dynamism into its slothful university system. But in general it provides a salutary warning against the sloppy use of the most powerful signals any employer has at his disposal.</td></tr></table>

<p>KENICHI OHMAE, a former head of McKinsey's Tokyo office whose book "The End of the Nation State" was reviewed in the December issue of <i>The Economist Review</i>, has long been identified with the most touted management trend: globalisation. He argues that, in a world in which national boundaries are dissolving and consumer tastes coalescing, companies can thrive only if they adopt the "Anchorage perspective" (named after a town that is equidistant from New York, D&uuml;sseldorf and Tokyo).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His collection of essays includes some of the best written on globalisation in recent years, including a revisionist one from Robert Reich, America's labour secretary. The collection fails, however, to explore the limits of the globalisation hypothesis. Truly globalised firms are, in fact, rare. Look at most multinationals and you find that they are more national, or even regional, than global in everything from the membership of their boards to the distribution of their shareholdings to the composition of their suppliers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best source of facts, figures and arguments on the multinationals is the United Nations' annual "World Investment Report". <font size=-1>UNCTAD</font> used to be highly critical of multinationals. It now seems almost to have fallen in love with them, and is forever praising them for setting a good example. The latest report thinks that "good practice" is ceasing to mean Japanese production methods, and is becoming Americanised yet again. It also notes the creation of highly successful hybrid management systems, produced by the collision between different cultures.</td></tr></table>

By Peter Drucker.<br>

<p>IN HIS 26th book, Peter Drucker is as insightful and eloquent as ever. It is a collection of recent essays on a wide variety of subjects, from reinventing government to the overseas Chinese, from family businesses to free trade, but the book is unified by three recurring themes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first is the sheer scale of contemporary managerial change. Mr Drucker argues that vertically-integrated companies are giving way to networked organisations; that loyal employees are being replaced by contract workers; and that knowledge workers are taking over from blue-collar workers as society's main wealth creators.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second theme is the cause of managerial failure. Mr Drucker argues that managers have failed to understand what it means to manage in revolutionary times; that they spend their time tinkering with their business when they should really be rethinking the whole theory on which it is based.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third theme is the organisational contradictions which are racking society: between business's need for perpetual innovation and the community's need for stability; between the rapidly changing nature of knowledge and the limited capacity of the human mind; between society's interest in the common good and business's need to compete internationally. It would be hard to find a better introduction to modern management theory.

<p>
</p><p><p>The Compensation Lag</p>
</p><p>It had survived two world wars, a national depression, and one earthquake, but in 1994, the World Series, the highlight of America's national pastime, was finally brought to its knees--broken by a players' strike over the issue of pay.
</p><p>The controversy that canceled the World Series and angered fans from coast to coast involved a handful of superstar athletes and an even smaller group of wealthy team owners arguing over already astronomically high salaries. Yet it nonetheless pointed to a basic dilemma facing every organization--large and small--around the world today: How, in the face of dramatic change, can we continue to motivate our employees, satisfy our customers, improve the qualiy of our products and services, increase our productivity and profit margin, and all the while stay on top of the competition? And what role, if any, should pay-- a powerful but often misunderstood force--play in the process?
</p><p>The solution thus far has been elusive, despite a growing army of experts and ideas. You only have to pick up a business magazine, watch television, or go to a bookstore to see what a booming business the business of rebuilding business has become. Not that there is anything wrong with reading such books, many of which are excellent, or listening to the growing number of experts, many of whom offer outstanding advice.
</p><p>The problem is that most offer only a single answer, a small piece of the puzzle, one organizational strategy, perhaps. So, instead of trying to integrate new business strategies with new company goals, new organizational designs, and the changing values and attitudes of people, many organizations have simply kept adding the latest bells and whistles, the latest solution du jour.
</p><p>As a result, they have created organizational monsters more dysfunctional than Dr. Frankenstein's, structures and strategies more complex and less efficient than a Rube Goldberg schematic. And, after more than a decade of pursuing the latest "business trends," many companies have, like the car-chasing mongrel that just discovered a superhighway, either been flattened by progress or collapsed in a tail-dragging, tongue-tied heap by the side of the road, exhausted, bewildered, and mad as hell.
</p><p>FLOPPING FADS, FIZZLING PHILOSOPHIES
</p><p>The Wall StreetJournal put the issue into perspective with a page 1 story headlined "Many Companies Try Management Fads, Only to See Them Flop." The article was a well-documented indictment of some of the most highly touted business and management trends--including those in compensation--of the 1990s.
</p><p>"Process re-engineering, benchmarking, total quality management, broadbanding, worker empowerment, skill-based pay," it began. "The labels abound when it comes to the trendy remedies executives are using to try to breathe new life and competitive fire into their companies.
</p><p>"But while these approaches may promise more motivated work forces and greater productivity, the results often fall far short. When this happens, companies find they must sharply modify, abandon, or find antidotes to programs that bring sweeping changes to organizational and human resource management."' <br>

<h2>P<font size=-1>EOPLE</font>, P<font size=-1>ERFORMANCE</font> <font size=-1>AND</font> P<font size=-1>AY</font><br></h2>

</p><p>In the rush to reengineer, implement TQM practices, form teams, and embrace other popular business strategies, most organizations have overlooked a critical component of successful change: how they pay their employees. Even though their responsibilities and corporate environments have undergone radical changes, most employees are still paid in the same ways they were paid twenty- tive years ago. Thousands of companies still dole out annual merit increases and determine pay levels on the basis of employees' knowledge, length of service, number of direct reports, and rank on the organizational ladder--values whose relevance has faded in today's flatter, taster, more flexible business environment.
</p><p>Now The Hay Group, which for the past forty years has set the standard globally for eftective pay strategies, has addressed this important issue--and once again has rewritten the rules for pay. People, Performance, and Pay identities today's four most common organizational work cultures--functional, process, time-based, and network--and explains how to align innovative pay policies with each. With examples from LEGO, Hallmark, Holiday Inn, and other leading organizations, the authors explain how to assess an organization's current culture and determine what its future culture should be. They then demonstrate pay's role in such change initiatives. and how compensation must be integrated with other human resource processes, such as selection, training, and pertbrmance management. They also discuss the full range of pay strategies available today and how they can be best used to move the organization forward; for example, they recommend decreasing an organization's emphasis on base pay as it shifts from a functional culture to a process, time-based, or network culture. They also offer guidance on establishing team rewards, especially important in process and teambased cultures, and make a compelling case for putting more pay at risk through variable pay strategies. Here also is strategic advice on competency based pay, perfommance-based rewards such as gainshanng, executive pay, and benefits programs.
</p><p>As responsibility for compensation strategies and compensation decisions shifts away from the realm of the Human Resource Department, line managers and senior executives will find People, Performance, and Pay an invaluable reference for effectively using salary, incentives, and benefits to motivate and reward employees, improve quality, and increase productivity. <br>

<p>
</p><p><p>The New Era of Eurocapitalism</p>
</p><p>Herbert A. Henzler
</p><p>Capitalism was born in Europe. But for nearly half a century, its most vigorous offshoots have flourished in the United States and Japan, while our economic performance has been lackluster. Or so the familiar litany goes. Despite our venerable commercial achievements--and the great European thinkers who defined the very institutions of capitalism--the continent that dominated world events for thousands of years seems to have fallen irretrievably behind.
</p><p>First came the devastation of World War II and the enormous work of reconstruction in Europe, work that only government had the resources to undertake. Then in later years, as the United States and Japan prospered, we grappled with stagnant economies, high unemployment and social welfare costs, and an exaggerated fear of invasion by American business interests. Now, with the drive toward 1992 and the single market gaining momentum, other difficulties have arisen: we are lagging badly in critical sectors like electronics; a new regulatory bureaucracy has emerged in Brussels; and once again we face the threat of economic invasion--this time from the Japanese.
</p><p>All in all, the verdict seems inescapable. Try as we might, politicians and media pundits say, we simply cannot manage as well as our American and Far Eastern competitors. "Eurocapitalism" has lost its historic edge.
</p><p>My own view, however, is that this conventional verdict is wrong. Many European businesses are doing far better than anyone would have predicted ten years ago, and their future looks brighter still. Indeed, I believe that our capitalist system is, in many ways, better suited than its U.S. or Japanese counterparts to meet the economic, social, and environmental challenges of the years ahead.
</p><p>The conventional wisdom, with its handwringing conclusions, seriously misreads both the likely prospects of European business in the 1990s and the nature of the worldwide contest in which we are engaged. The competitive battle senior managers now face is not some kind of factory-to-factory combat with mirror-image rivals in other parts of the world. Rather, it is a deeper struggle among different capitalist systems, each with its own distinctive set of values, priorities, institutions, and goals.
</p><p>In this contest of competing systems, the measure of success should not be limited to trade flows, exchange rates, or productivity improvements, significant as those measures are. Instead, the most important question is: Which of the three capitalist systems can give its people the best standard of living and most fully prepare them for the future?
</p><p>Consider some of the challenges global competition presents, especially with this question in mind. Managers from every country are now required to deal effectively with employees of many nationalities and to maintain cohesiveness not just in the workplace but also in the rest of society. They must structure and oversee alliance-like relationships with other organizations. They are expected to balance the need for corporate economic growth with the health of the physical environment and with the broader social welfare of the countries in which they operate.
</p><p>On each of these dimensions, Europe's accumulated skill and experience give its managers a distinct advantage. European forays abroad are not a recent addon to a history of domestic enterprise. As traders, we roamed the world for centuries, and, as industrialists, we have been similarly adventuresome: given the limited size of Europe's national markets, we have always had to think internationally. Nor has our pattern been to set up shop in a country and then pull out as soon as current earnings decline. Since its arrival in 1894, Siemens has Outlived several revolutions in Mexico, and the Brazilian and Argentinean subsidiaries of what is now ABB are also nearly a century old.
</p><p>The ability to maintain a genuinely international outlook and to balance economic performance with social inclusiveness is what Eurocapitalism does best. More to the point, it is what every economic system will have to do in order to compete successfully in a global economy. And that gives Europe's managers a historic opportunity to recapture lost ground, an opportunity they are well equipped to grasp. <br>

</p><p>The Evolving Global Economy Making Sense of the New World Order
</p><p>Today's global economy is genuinely borderless. Information, capital, and innovation flow all over the world at top speed, enabled by technology and fueled by consumers' desires for access to the best and least expensive products.
</p><p>This instant migration of ideas and resources has rendered assumptions about international competition obsolete. In its wake, policymakers and managers have had to accept the legitimacy of many forms of capitalism, rework the mechanics of trade policy, and redefine the objectives and responsibilities of top-level management.
</p><p>The Evolving Global Economy collects 16 articles from the Harvard Business Review that illuminate the broad effort to rethink cross-border flows of economic activity. Contributions from strategists, executives, and scholars from the public and private sectors--including Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad, Michael Porter, Paul Krugman, and U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich--help to define and shape the new terms of debate.
</p><p>as Kenichi Ohmae suggests in his preface, there is real danger--not just lost opportunity--in dealing with today's borderless economy as if it were a minor variant of post-war global configurations. The Evolving Global Economy will help managers understand how the complex interactions of the participants affect their own businesses and contribute to the ever-changing landscape of the global economy. <br>

</p><p>GLOBAL TRENDS
</p><p>This chapter examines the role of foreign direct investment (FD1) in the world economy and reviews recent global trends in stocks and flows, as well as the activities of the principal actors, transnational corporations (TNCs). The key development was that the recession in FDI flows came to an end in 1993, thanks to renewed economic growth in some major source countries and the solid growth performances of many developing economies. Investments from developing countries, though small, also played a role in the upturn of FDI flows. As a result, traditional patterns of FDI -- a focus on the developed countries where, in any event, most of the investment stock is located -- are reasserting themselves, although the developing countries appear to be in the process of shifting that pattern in their favour. The underlying trend is for the largest 100 TNCs to become increasingly internationalized, with investments abroad aimed at gaining markets for outputs and access to markets of factors of production. These twin objectives underlie the organization of international production, using various modalities that fall increasingly under the governance of TNCs.
</p><p>A. Recent Trends in foreign direct investment
</p><p>l. The growing importance of foreign direct investment
</p><p>International production by TNCs dominates international commercial transactions. It is more important than trade. Global sales generated by the foreign affiliates of TNCs were worth $5.2 trillion in 1992 (table I.1), exceeding worldwide exports of goods and (nonfactor) services worth $4.9 trillion in that year ($4.8 trillion in 1993) (an estimated one-third of which takes place on an intra-firm basis). During 1991 - 1993, the world FDI stock grew about twice as fast as worldwide exports of goods and services which, in turn, grew about one and-a-half times faster than world gross domestic product.
</p><p>One measure of the importance of inward FDI to an economy is its size relative to gross fixed capital formation. For developing countries, that ratio increased from 2 per cent to 7 per cent between 1985 and 1993, while the upward trend in that ratio during 19851989 for the developed countries was reversed during the FDI recession (figure 1.1). As a result, FDI now plays a bigger role in investment in the developing than in the developed countries.
</p><p>The flow of financial capital in the form of FDI is one aspect of the multitude of activities and cross-border transactions associated with international production. In developing countries, inward FDI is an increasingly important form of long-term net resource flows, and sustained FDI growth during the 1990s has taken place alongside a general surge in private capital flows, <br>

Now that the Cold War is over, there is much talk about a new kind of conflict,
a conflict, a conflict between civilizations. This has revived the notion (which
never quite disappeared) of an absolute division between East and West. The
Missionary and the Libertine collects Ian Baruma's essays. Many of them
originally published in The New York Review of Books, which should serve as
a counterblast to this fashionable idea. Baruma describes how Westerners have
been attracted and repelled by Asian sensuality. He explores the nature of
Japanese sexuality in movies, and the erotic dreams of young girls in Banana
Yoshimoto's work. He examines the cultural confusion in individuals--Benazir
Bhutto, Imelda Marcos, Yukio Mishima and V.S. Naipaul--and he goes on to
discuss the last days of Hong Kong as a British colony, the Olympic Games in
South Korea, the legacies of Pearl Harbor and of Hiroshima, Japan-bashing,
racial war, and the life of an black American baseball-player in Japan.
<p>Ian Buruma's intimate knowledge of the East allows him to disentangle the knotty thickets that bind culture and politics together. The Missionary and the Libertine will confirm his reputation as one of the leading writers on Asian affairs. </p>

<h2>Burum, burum</h2><ul> <li><a href="7ex206.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> M<font size=-1>ISSIONARY</font> <font size=-1>AND</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> L<font size=-1>IBERTINE</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Ian Buruma. <br>
</ul>

<p>WESTERN readers on the look-out for books about modern Asia are not on the whole well served. The choice so often comes down to formulaic tales of journeys by bike, raft or jalopy, or to worthy essays in political economy full of figures and theory. Ian Buruma is one of the few authors writing about Asia who can navigate successfully between romance and the academy. Though from Europe himself, he has lived in Asia and knows it well. His witty, pleasant writing brings the region to life. But he is up on intellectual trends and almost always has a point to make.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The Missionary and the Libertine" is a set of articles collected mainly from literary-and-political magazines. Its range is wide. Topics include, for example, odd attitudes to sex in the work of Banana Yashimoto, a Japanese novelist, as well as inconsistencies in the political ideas of Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister of Pakistan. Inevitably, collections of articles like this have their weaknesses, and there is something a bit forced in the attempt by the publisher to try to link together the disparate essays in this one as a "counterblast" to fashionable ideas about the clash between East and West. But Mr Buruma's writing offers plenty of compensations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He is alive to the variety and depth of Asian cultures, without being bewitched by the idea of Asian otherness. Such level-headedness gives balance to his political judgments. He is scornful both of Edwin Reischauer, a former American ambassador to Japan who is fawningly respectful of Japanese culture, and of Michael Crichton, a bestselling American novelist, whose paranoid fantasies about Japanese efforts to "control" the United States are devastatingly rebutted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In his last two essays Mr Buruma takes on the "Asian-values" school directly. This is a fat target. It is far from clear that hard-to-define moral and cultural patterns explain variations in economic performance between Asia and the West--or that such supposed patterns are in any meaningful sense Asia-wide at all. Mr Buruma's essay on Singapore is a particularly fine piece of work because it pins down by careful description just what it is about the country that makes it seem sinister to people with even vaguely liberal instincts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is harder than you might think. Western journalists often struggle to express what they dislike about Singapore, a country, after all, that is prosperous and well run, and has democratically-elected rulers. Too often they concentrate on comparative trivialities, such as the fabled ban on chewing gum or the caning of an American teenage vandal. Apter criticism risks losing readers in the minutiae of Singaporean law and politics. In contrast, Mr Buruma offers an anecdotal but exacting account of how the Singaporean courts and government operate. His essay should be placed in the hands of any outsider who wants to cut through the usual obfuscations and understand Singapore. It is also a fitting end to a fluent and enjoyable book.

MISHIMA YUKIO
<p>The Suicidal Dandy</p>
<p>A startling article appeared in 1984 in the Japanese edition of Penthouse magazine. In between photographs of half-undressed Japanese starlets and fully nude Western models (pubic hair carefully airbrushed away) was a story about Mishima Yukio. A housewife named Ota claimed to have been in close touch with Mishima's spirit for the last seven years. He had dictated to her messages, manuscripts and plans, one of which was to stage a musical of the Kojiki, an eighth-century chronicle of ancient myths. It is unlikely that even Mishima would have stooped to quite that level of bad taste. But the article and its presentation are typical of the way Mishima is regarded by many Japanese: a combination of ridicule and unease, of reverence and titillation.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is this feeling of ambivalence, of not quite knowing what to make of the man, that has made Mishima a non-subject in Japan. Not much is written about him any more. Few people talk about him. Sales of his books are slow. It is hard to say whether the Japanese are truly uninterested or whether there is a kind of national conspiracy of silence, to blot out an embarrassing memory. The fuss caused by Paul Schrader's film Mishima, even before it was screened in Japan, makes one suspect the latter, but one cannot be sure.</p>
<p>How different is Mishima's legacy in the West. He is the most translated Japanese author, and certainly the best known, despite being, as Gore Vidal put it in the New York Review of Books in June 1971, 'a minor artist': minor in the sense that he had only one subject - himself.</p>
<p>Mishima himself would no doubt have been pleased. He was desperate for recognition in the West. Much of his grandstanding was aimed at Westerners, especially when it looked most 'Japanese'. One of his most bizarre creations, a film called Patriotism, which he wrote, directed and starred in, about a young army officer who commits ritual suicide with his wife, had its premiere in Paris. (Typically, this quintessentially 'Japanese' piece, staged like a Noh play, was set to Wagner's Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde.) His 'Western' dandyism - shades, aloha shirts, his claimed affinities with Thomas Mann and Elvis Presley - were more for home consumption, to shock the locals. Mishima was like those Japanese society ladies who dress in evening gowns in Tokyo but in kimonos abroad.</p>
<p>Mishima was an extreme mythomaniac. Any assessment of his life would have to start with a close scrutiny of the myths, to sort out what was real and what mere posing. This is an almost impossible task, as Mishima probably took at least some of his poses seriously and, as Marguerite Yourcenar rightly says in her book Mishima ou la vision du vide on the man and his death (which she calls his chef-d'oeuvre), 'the elements of his own culture and those of the West, which he had absorbed avidly, elements both banal and strange to us, are mixed in all his works'. It is a necessary task none the less, for otherwise one is forced to take his myths at face value. And this seems to be what the Schraders (Paul wrote the script with his brother, Leonard) and Yourcenar have done. </p>

Frank McLynn's Jung is the first full-length biography of the great Swiss
psychologist. Early in Jung's career he was the admirer and protege of Sigmund
Freud, the adopted 'Son' to Freud's 'Father'; then, after their famous quarrel,
he became his rival and bitter enemy. Controversial for his right-wing views,
his alleged anti-Semitism and his sexual promiscuity, Jung nonetheless seemed
to many a more acceptable icon than Freud, not least because he opposed
Freud's atheism and stressed the necessary and overwhelming role of religion
in the life of the individual. With his discovery of the universal symbols of the
collective unconscious; his explorations of the role of dreams in the journey
towards psychic wholeness; his speculations about the true nature of God; his
passionate and profound interest in myth and in oriental religion, in alchemy
and astrology; his theory of synchronicity, he has begun to emerge as the
favourite philosopher, the hero and guru of the New Age, a source of
'alternative' modes of thought that have already fascinated generations and that
now seem set fair to attract a whole new audience, especially among the young.
<p>Already esteemed for his historical biographies, Frank McLynn has now produced a fascinating portrait of a truly extraordinary man and thinker, at a time when he may be approaching his greatest fame. </p>

<p><b>Freud's great rival</b></p>
<h2>A hatchet job</h2><ul> <li><a href="9ex274.html">C<font size=-1>ARL</font> G<font size=-1>USTAV</font> J<font size=-1>UNG</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Frank McLynn. <br>
</ul><p>PREVIOUS books by Frank McLynn include biographies of two intrepid Victorian explorers, H.M. Stanley and Richard Burton. They are subjects much more to his liking; Carl Jung, the explorer of the interior of the mind, is certainly not. Indeed, it is hard to fathom why anybody would wish to expend so much time and so many words on a person he finds so distasteful.

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Again and again Mr McLynn denounces Jung--who, God knows, was no saint--for moral degeneracy in every sphere of his life. He was an ungrateful son. He despised his pastor father as a weakling and failure, and had mixed feelings about his mother, who appeared to him to be an ordinary woman at times but invested with uncanny powers at others. From this unedifying starting point, Mr McLynn indulges in the kind of reductive analysis of Jung that the psychiatrist despised: namely that all Jung's struggles in his personal and professional life go back to his relationship with mummy and daddy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jung's relations with the other significant people in his life appear to have been just as unsatisfactory. He married his wife, Emma, for her money and then betrayed her through his many infidelities with other women, including patients. Mr McLynn's constant refrain is that the twin driving forces in Jung's life were sex and money. His subject also stands accused of being a bully towards his family, his colleagues and the many women who flocked around him. Then there is "his vocabulary of foul-mouthed abuse": he referred to one patient as a "slimy bastard", another as an "empty gasbag", and yet another "a pisspot of unconscious devils". And he told one to "stop buggering about and wasting my time."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of this sits easily alongside the current view of Jung as <i>homo religiosus</i> and guru of the New Age who helped to reconcile science and religion. The author devotes roughly a third of the book to Jung's relationship with Freud and his bias is evident--the Austrian is portrayed in a favourable light, the Swiss is denigrated. For instance, Mr McLynn dismisses the charge that Freud had an affair with his sister-in-law, Minna--an affair attested to by an authoritative historian, Peter Swales--but repeatedly refers to Jung's liaisons, often without any corroborating evidence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After he broke with Freud, his former collaborator and mentor, Jung went on the develop his own psychological system. This incorporated a number of key concepts. They included the collective unconscious, the repository of mankind's psychic heritage and realm of the archetypes--inherited patterns in the mind that exist through time and space. Then there were anima/animus, the image of contrasexuality in the unconscious of each individual, and shadow, the repressed unwanted aspect of a person. And there was the theory of psychological types--introvert and extrovert--influenced by William James's dichotomy of tough- and tender-minded individuals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jung also developed his theory of individuation, which holds that each individual's goal in life is to achieve his own potential. This is the ultimate quest of an in-depth Jungian analysis.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr McLynn gets in a muddle when he attempts to grapple with any of the above. He fares better when dealing with Jung's interest in the occult and the paranormal. But his over-reliance on previously published materials gives his book a mildewy feel. His sources include Jung's "autobiography", which Sonu Shamdasani has shown to be largely the work of Jung's secretary.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The book contains many mistakes, including the following about Jung's long-time mistress, Toni Wolff: "When she called in Dr Gerhard Adler on 19th March 1953, she already knew she was dying." Adler was not a medical doctor and far from treating Toni Wolff was in Zurich to have a few sessions of analysis with her. It may, however, be enjoyed by those who like their history served up as faction.

A SWISS CHILDHOOD
<p>To understand Carl Gustav Jung one must first understand Switzerland, and this is no easy matter. People become puzzled when confronted with a republic that has no president but a communal leadership consisting of an executive council. The technicalities of confederation rather than federalism--the technical distinction is that in confederation the central government has powers over the member states but not directly over their citizens--leads to further confusions. Compound this with a geography that produces cis-Alpine, trans-Alpine and inter-Alpine cantons and a political culture not based on a single language and one is already faced with a social complexity that matches the notorious difficulty of Jung's psychological thought. Some observers have even suggested a stricter determinism: that Jung could not have had the theories he had if he had been born elsewhere, since the Swiss constitution is itself 'Jungian'.</p>
<p>Superstitious, xenophobic, conservative, earthbound, introverted, moneyminded--all these epithets have been used to describe Jung, and even more frequently to describe his native country. That Jung was not an untypical 'Switzer' he himself recognized, and he would usually take it in his stride when accused of being 'moralistic', 'mystical', or 'Tuetonically confused'. He was quite prepared to admit that he was a bigoted Swiss and even revelled in the idea of being a product of Swiss wooden-headedness.</p>
<p>He conceded that his fellow-countrymen were primitive and said that their love of cattle reminded him of the African; adding that there was a lot of deeply buried and archaic earth mysticism in Switzerland. As for conservatism, he declared that for the Swiss a new idea was like an unknown dangerous animal which had to be either avoided or else approached with extreme caution--which was why, in his view, the Swiss had such poor intuitive capacity. Their aristocratic posture revealed itself in indifference to the opinions of others. As for introversion, this was a function both of xenophobia and neutrality in the affairs of the world on one hand and the peculiar Swiss political culture on the other, where warlike instincts were channeled inwards into domestic political life. </p>

</ul>

RUSSIA has always baffled foreigners. Five years after the banning of the Communist Party, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the apparent dawn of a liberal-democratic era, many Western hopes for change lie in ashes. Nor were all those hopes ill-informed or foolish. What went wrong? Or are the gloom and uncertainty attending the current presidential election themselves exaggerated? These four books, each very different but all by Russians, shed light on the obstacles facing liberal democracy in Russia and on what might be emerging in its place.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oleg Poptsov is a liberal casualty of Russia's war in Chechnya. Appointed by Boris Yeltsin in early 1991 as head of Russia's new television channel, he kept his job for an extraordinary five years until fired last February just as Mr Yeltsin announced his bid for a second presidential term. Too many dead bodies on the evening news, Mr Yeltsin is said to have complained.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Poptsov's candour was bound to plunge him into trouble at some point, Chechnya or no Chechnya. Like Saint-Simon observing Louis XIV's court at Versailles, he etches unflattering vignettes of the men around the throne. Tsar Boris haunts these pages, ever more at the mercy of boyars and bureaucrats, who are as eager to foil him as to do each other down.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A Komsomol newspaper editor drawn into politics by perestroika, Mr Poptsov's sympathies are with his former boss but he never loses his objectivity or his gift for a telling phrase. He describes Mr Yeltsin, who was once a building engineer, as having a fragmented mind, "rather like prefab concrete panels". He recognises Mr Yeltsin's courage in entering politics on his own, his intuitive approach to complex matters of state and his feel for crowds, traits that fit logically with another, more damaging, one: the distrust of peers. Without a team of strong-minded advisers, Mr Poptsov predicted early on, Mr Yeltsin would quickly fall prisoner to the old apparat, whatever new label it chose to use.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From his television eyrie Mr Poptsov kept an eye on the revolving door to the president's office, through which Gennady Burbulis, Ruslan Khasbulatov, Alexander Rutskoi, Sergei Shakhrai and many others passed. One of the more acid portraits is of Alexander Korzhakov, Mr Yeltsin's chief bodyguard and closest confidant. At the height of Mr Yeltsin's struggle with Alexander Rutskoi in 1993, Mr Poptsov refused to screen a report attacking this dissident vice-president. "Never mind," Mr Korzhakov muttered, "they [Messrs Rutskoi and Poptsov] can share a cell together."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The danger for his former boss, as Mr Poptsov sees it, is a growing isolation and a steady restriction of the information reaching him from his closest aides. He laments "the triumph of those with whom the leader goes to the bathhouse, or celebrates around the dinner table, or swims, or hunts, or goes fishing."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This intriguing chronicle ends as "the bathhouse team" leads Mr Yeltsin into the Chechen adventure, an operation which the general staff had fooled themselves and the president into thinking would last but a few days. Without notes or index, this volume is a written equivalent of St Basil's cathedral in Red Square, a seemingly deliberate muddle in which readers not familiar with the chronology and plot are almost bound to get lost. But despite this it is also a treasure chest for anyone who wants to understand the inside workings of the Kremlin in the past five years.</p>
<p><b>From the outside</b>
<br>Like Mr Poptsov, Yuri Burtin is a liberal but, unlike him, a Kremlin outsider. A literary journalist, he speaks as one of the intelligentsia, far from the corridors of power. In this collection of essays and articles, he argues that Mr Yeltsin struck a strategic compromise with the old Soviet nomenklatura after the failed coup of 1991, a deal that betrayed Mr Yeltsin's earlier commitment to true democratisation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The author sees continuities between the new government and earlier Russian regimes, both Soviet and Tsarist. He compares the botched reforms of the 1990s to the partial abolition of serfdom in the 1860s under Alexander II. To him, the wretched Russian system of government is an <i>oboroten</i> (werewolf), forever changing its appearance but never its nature. "There is now less democracy in Russia than at the peak of perestroika," Mr Burtin writes. "Once again," he thinks, "there is no society, just the state and the population, the authorities and the people." On the basis of this consistently bleak view, Mr Burtin has argued since 1992 that Russia's democrats should keep a safe distance from the Yeltsin regime. The president's Chechen adventure and his abandonment of liberal supporters might well seem to reinforce this line of argument. But, for all its appeal, Mr Burtin overstates the view that there is little or nothing to choose between Mr Yeltsin and his nationalist opponents, and so fails to make his council of despair convincing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alexander Yanov's vantage point is different again. Though also a liberal, he is a professional historian. Made to emigrate to the United States by the Brezhnev regime in 1974, he was allowed to return in 1990 and has watched politics in Russia closely since. Unless the West is more involved in Russia, he believes, the country may drift into fascism or something as bad. Mr Yanov was once what Russians call a "white raven" (a misfit) among American Soviet-watchers. In the peaceful Brezhnev era, his warnings about the rise of extreme Russian nationalism sounded simply eccentric. But a glance at a book Mr Yanov wrote in 1987, "The Russian Challenge and Year 2000", will show how far-sighted he was. In it, he predicted that communist and nationalist ideas would before long fuse into a potent ideology of counter-reform.</p>
<p><b>Back to Byzantium</b></b>
<br>In "After Yeltsin" Mr Yanov looks into a post-Yeltsin abyss and repeats his warning that Russia's fragile democracy faces a tide of communist and nationalist revenge. He offers a layman's tour of the intellectual background to the new Russian right, including the "Eurasianism" of Lev Gumilyov and the anti-Semitic nationalism of Igor Shafarevich--a tour which is itself a useful reminder that dangerous or pernicious ideas are seldom ravings from lunatics but more often well-argued points from clever, plausible minds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among the opposition figures interviewed by Mr Yanov for his research in 1993-94 was Gennady Zyuganov, a leader of the new Russian Communist Party. Mr Zyuganov has close links to a think-tank known as Spiritual Heritage which led the way in producing the very climate of ideas that Mr Yanov predicted. The label for him used here, "National Bolshevik", was originally applied to anti-communist White Russian intellectuals who in the 1920s accepted the Bolsheviks because they had preserved and strengthened Russia. Mr Zyuganov, similarly, believes in <i>derzhava</i> (a strong Russian state). No Marxist, he boasted to Mr Yanov that he had been expelled from the Communist Party under Brezhnev for his nationalist views.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Zyuganov is sometimes compared to Slobodan Milosevic, a standard example of the cynical office-holder who makes off in the lifeboat of nationalism as communism sinks. This is misleading. There is every sign that Mr Zyuganov's nationalist beliefs are sincere. Unlike Mr Yeltsin, with his intuition and his concrete panels, Mr Zyuganov is driven by historical ideas, most of them bizarre and distasteful to the Western mind but a genuine part nonetheless of an authentic Russian tradition. He is more careful with words and less colourful than Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a rival, but his anti-Western views are much the same. "I Believe in Russia" should be read and re-read by anyone who thinks that Mr Zyuganov is really a social democrat who might yet make a comfortable partner for the West. He takes a paranoid view of history in which Russia is a permanent victim of evil outside forces. Readers of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion", a 1905 forgery, or of Soviet-era propaganda will find the Manichean tone depressingly familiar.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is nevertheless a rational core to his argument. Whereas Marx and Lenin took history's motor to be class struggle, Mr Zyuganov sees it as a geopolitical and spiritual battle between Russian and Western civilisation, dating back to the schism between Rome and Byzantium in 1054. Belief in "the clash of civilisations" may be wrong, but it is not absurd or dismissable out of hand. Were it so, the presence of Mr Zyuganov and the many Russians who think like him would look less irksome.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though he drops names right and left (Francis Fukuyama, Lev Gumilyov, Samuel Huntington, Oswald Spengler and Arnold Toynbee all get a mention), Mr Zyuganov draws most deeply on two 19th century Slavophile thinkers, Konstantin Leontiev and Nikolai Danilevsky, both of whom saw Russia as a distinct civilisation apart from the West. As Mr Zyuganov vividly describes it, medieval Western Europe was a militaristic armed camp, arrogant and intolerant, sending its crusading knights against the peaceful Slavic and Byzantine world to the East. As in Eisenstein's brilliant Stalin-era film, "Alexander Nevsky", the enemy comes from the West, not the East. (As a Eurasianist in the tradition of Gumilyov, Mr Zyuganov lets the invading Mongols off lightly by contrast.)</p>
<p><b>The threat to Holy Russia</b>
<br>While the East preserved Justinian's Byzantine-theocratic "symphony of powers" and collectivist values, the West, according to Mr Zyuganov, created an over-rational, individualistic, money-seeking society and a heartless, empty culture to go with it, peopled, as it were, with the brainchildren of Voltaire and Disney. Far from enjoying any moral superiority, Western colonialism exterminated whole peoples, whereas Russia's expansion into Siberia was "almost bloodless" and preserved local cultures. The expansion of Muscovy and the Russian state was simply a natural response to the "hegemonistic" aspirations of the West. By the 19th century, Mr Zyuganov goes on, the influence of the Jewish diaspora in Western Europe was "growing literally not by the day but by the hour", until it controlled the economic system, while the "messianic pretension" of the Jews to be the chosen people imprinted itself ever deeper on Western culture.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After this unpleasant flirt with an old and deep-rooted Russian anti-Semitism, Mr Zyuganov skates delicately around the Bolshevik revolution--a subject communists and nationalists find it hard to agree about. On balance, he writes, the revolution was a good thing as it strengthened the Russian state, purging it of "out-of-date feudal and bourgeois forms". Stalin gets high marks for restoring the traditional patriotic ideology of Russian statehood, but his good work between 1945 and 1953 was undone by Nikita Khrushchev's "thaw". The Cold War, on this view, was not the definitive ideological battle of communism and capitalism, but a passing episode in an unfinished war between two civilisations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The collapse of the Soviet Union, according to Mr Zyuganov, was the result of a well-laid plot by Western intelligence using a fifth column of Russian politicians. He blames the "open Russophobia of the denationalised part of society"--crudely coded language meaning mostly Russian Jews. Russia, he goes on, must recover its lost greatness and lost territories, while simultaneously seeking a spiritual rebirth through traditional values and religious ideals. It is not a rewarmed Marxism-Leninism that has to be feared if Mr Zyuganov or his ideas prevail but a return to the theocratic ideas of medieval Byzantium and to the Slavophile dream of Muscovy as a "Third Rome". "Today for the first time in three centuries we have a real chance to restore the symphonic unity of our spiritual and state traditions," he writes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the cherished mentality of <i>sobornost</i> (collective spirituality) is incompatible with capitalism, Mr Zyuganov thinks Russia must resist being drawn into a world economic system that may leave it dependent on hostile outside forces. The enemy here is the West's "trading and financial cosmopolitan oligarchy", which seeks "world domination" and which, with its faithless Russian helpers, is trying to impose on Russia a "cosmopolitan regime expressing the interests of world capital and the local comprador bourgeoisie". So much for foreign investment and the <font size=-1>IMF</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How far Mr Zyuganov's views are shared by his party colleagues is uncertain. Nor is it obvious how far he may be able to further them under Yeltsin II or apply them in a post-Yeltsin Russia. But at least those views are now known; and nobody can say they did not have fair warning.

<p><b>English critics</b></p>
<h2>On Dover Beach</h2><ul> <li>M<font size=-1>ATTHEW</font> A<font size=-1>RNOLD</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Nicholas Murray.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Hodder &amp; Stoughton; 336 pages; &#163;20</i> <br>
</ul>

<p>IN HIS poem, "Rugby Chapel", Matthew Arnold remembered his father as "a mighty oak". His father, Thomas Arnold, immortalised in the novel "Tom Brown's Schooldays" and in Lytton Strachey's portrait in "Eminent Victorians", is probably the most famous English public-school headmaster. He was an earnest and forceful character, the influential proponent of a hearty Christian ethic, and must, by any standards, have been a difficult act to follow. Yet somewhat in vain does Nicholas Murray search for the psychological effect that such a father might have had; apart from a youthful flippancy and facetiousness, almost certainly a reaction to his father, Matthew Arnold emerges from "under the boughs" his own man, a great poet and a noted man of letters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Matthew Arnold was born in 1822, the second child of Thomas and Mary Arnold. His early childhood by the Thames at Laleham, not far from London, before his father's appointment to Rugby School, appears to have been idyllic. It bred in him a love of the Thames, and themes of running water and waves and seas recur in his poetry. His love of the river was augmented at Oxford where, with the poet Arthur Hugh Clough and other friends, he appears to have had one of those times on which legends of Oxford are created--arguing, learning, pastoral days of male companionship; his is the line about Oxford: "And that sweet City with her dreaming spires."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To marry Fanny Lucy Wightman, the daughter of a judge, he needed an income; so in 1851 he became an inspector of schools, a job he was to hold for 35 years, long after his poetry and criticism made him a literary celebrity. He inspected schools from Bethnal Green to Pembroke Dock, travelling which would not be done very much faster today. He also reported on education in Europe. It would have been interesting to learn more of what he, with his intelligence and a liking for children, observed in those Victorian institutions. He remained strongly in favour of education for all, for, as he put it, "the little ploughboy". He felt that the new elementary schools would be important for "civilising the next generation of the lower classes, who, as things are going, will have most of the political power of the country in their hands."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new middle classes he abhorred, calling them "the Philistines", in the grip of an unthinking materialism brought on by "the absorbing and brutalising influence of our passionate material progress...our railways, our business and our fortune-making." He had it in for the Atlantic telegraph--"that great rope with a Philistine at each end of it talking inutilities." What would he have said of the Internet?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He was in essence, a high-flown intellectual, deeply immersed in the classics. When he became professor of poetry at Oxford, his famous lectures were on the translation of Homer. He claimed that the role of the critic was "simply to know the best that is known and thought in the world". Seen in recent times as elitist and in his own times as supercilious, he was more complicated than that. It was said of him that when he woke each morning he was convinced that everything was an open question. A staunch Liberal, he was reactionary in some of his views, almost socialist in others. Any pomposity was tempered with a vivacity and sense of humour, and behind his superior airs was a modest and playful man, if somewhat egotistical.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His family life, though clouded by the deaths of three of six children, was otherwise content, and meant a great deal to him. He loved animals and had a passion for wild flowers. By the end of his life he was much sought after socially, a distinguished member of the chattering classes of the time. Though his poetry petered out, he continued to write articles and to pontificate. He died suddenly on his way to meet his daughter and granddaughter who were arriving at Liverpool from America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We are left now with some marvellous poetry, combining high intellect and great feeling, examples of which--"Dover Beach" or "The Scholar-Gipsy" for instance--will always be found in anthologies. His evocations of the country with descriptions of all manner of wild flowers, of birds, and especially of elms, have some of the nostalgic fascination of old watercolours.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A strength of this biography is its picture, worked up from contemporary papers, of an educated and well-connected person's life in the mid-19th century. Arnold went for walks with Wordsworth, a family friend, in the Lake District; was entranced (though not persuaded) by Cardinal Newman's sermons at Oxford--"subtle, sweet, mournful"; he was on familiar terms with both Disraeli and Gladstone; he disdained Tennyson, thought highly of George Sand; and entertained Charlotte Bront to tea--"past thirty and plain". The walk-on parts add much to the fascination.

'It is really a question of the weather, the private weather, unpredictable as
dreams yet recognisable as a climate, that the autobiographer must describe.'
<p>Henry James wrote that there are two kinds of lives worth writing: lives of those who have done a lot and lives of those who have thought a lot. Frank Kermode, now Britain's most distinguished literary critic, falls obviously into the second of these categories. But in his autobiography, Kermode has chosen not to discuss literate or criticism much at all, though the sense of them both is palpable. Instead he sets out, in a brilliant book for which he would make no such claim, to recreate the weather of his life.</p>
<p>He was born and brought up on the Isle of Man: the scenes, values and legacies of that intermittently tortuous and paradisaical society he paints with wonderful clarity. Then the Navy, and some of the best descriptions of the absurdity of war since Waugh's Sword of Honour.</p>
<p>Then what, following Verlaine, he calls simply 'the rest' - literature, literary life, literary people - individuals lovingly or plainly sketched, controversies delineated with a ferocious but never tiresome selfawareness. He makes plain what he thinks is the value of all this. We may not agree with him, but we will almost certainly close the book reflecting that this combination of infinite sadness and wonderful humour is very rare indeed. It contains shocks, pleasures or amusements on every page; and it describes the climate of a life. </p>

</ul>


<p>YOU will feel you have definitely met someone after reading this autobiographical memoir, but what sort of someone? As empty as the velvet box that throws the dice, but also deflated in some manner by the vigours of being alive? Yes, perhaps. But also someone interesting, annoying, appealing, spiky, friendly, self-knowing and self-ignorant.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Frank Kermode is one of Britain's most distinguished literary scholars--professor at London, Cambridge and Harvard, author of acclaimed critical works, noted editor, wise arbiter of theoretical quarrels, though you would not catch him boasting about any of that, not straightforwardly at least. He is clever and self-aware enough to know that the personality behind a famous life is not the long-playing record itself but only a scratch on it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kermode is a fearless memoirist, not at all afraid of the ridiculous at the heart of the sublime. A whole chapter is called "Errors", 63 bitter-wry pages which detail the life of a literary intellectual, including an ill-judged moment as editor of the <font size=-1>CIA</font>-backed magazine, <i>Encounter</i>. As such you have to admire this crafty book, whose subtlety borders on deviousness. He invites you to meet him with the same gesture, as he suggests he is not worth meeting. This is not exactly humility but the unusual grandeur of a personality that prefers to be alone, solo, sufficient. He is not the Greta Garbo of English criticism nor a Manx hermit in an igloo of stone, but a reclusive mind nonetheless that, after reading its thousand books, seems to have rather given up on humanity, and not just on others, but on himself too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is hard to identify the mysterious quality of this memoir. Is he trying to erase himself, line by line, like a ferocious child with a valuable manuscript? Or is it that the creative artist is the overflowing vessel and the critic the one that must make itself hollow to sound the echoes? Again, is the odd quality absence, a science he seems to have perfected in his life? As a Manx child he was "exiled from the life and language of the English". The world was "away". But he himself was also in exile from the concerns and social integers of his parents. He did not feel "at home in my homeland".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These feelings are profoundly shared by many a creative writer, and are sometimes the great engines of mighty works. So it is again curious that he felt he had no power as a creative writer and, meeting the old suspicion and perhaps prejudice of disgruntled writers, accepted the fate of a critic. Yet his criticism is not at all as insignificant as he would sometimes have you believe: he has even made literature out of the rattling bones of academic pursuits and is blamed (or praised) for helping introduce a tincture of French literary theory to Anglo-American letters. When finding himself at war in the moil of fashions and trends, he has lifted the reluctant sword, and for this, among other things, he was suitably knighted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Going to war in the conventional meaning--the second world war, that is--he found a fragmented world of inane-seeming naval officers and an equally inane warlessness wherever he went. He was surely in the war but the war was not where he was. This passage in the book has already been compared to Evelyn Waugh's work, but there is no novelist's distance here. We are invited in a way to be appalled by his officers at every turn, indeed throughout the book to be appalled by the things that appal him.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A memoir by a literary man is always going to be a construct. In that regard it is a compulsive book, and neatly structured. It is not always clear why he has chosen to focus on a particular matter. As he says in another context, "the inward eye can be overworked". As an interrogation of whatever it means to possess a "self" it is brutally insistent about the lightness, meanness and slightness of being alive. And yet what redeems the book from the hint of hollowness at its heart is the firm impression that a certain man has been met, a sort of king in his day, insisting on the more honest outfit of the commoner.

Man to Man
<p>Frank returns to Douglas (3,2,3) --Times crossword puzzle clue</p>
<p>BETWEEN THESE ORIGINS and that ending is where the weather is, fair or foul: the climate of a life. Not, as some have said, a dream, but a climate, a microclimate, le temps qu'il fait.</p>
<p>There can have been no salting of herring at our place during the autumn of 1919; my mother was pregnant and pregnant women cannot put down herring, it will simply disintegrate and leave you with a barrel of smelly slush. Taken with boiled potatoes and with buttermilk or water--Adam's ale--or, on rare occasions, real ale for Father, herring was a staple. Having to forfeit it was the first of many disappointments or privations imposed on a struggling young couple by their first child. They began even before he was born. That event took place at the end of November, in a tenement bedroom, neither place nor season propitious. Clearly he survived, and they lived through a herringless winter to ensure that he did, well enough to be writing this seventy-five wild Decembers later, dotage fended off, for the moment, by the thin roof of sanity.</p>
<p>Part of the difficulty these kind people experienced in rearing me was that I was generally unable, with my best efforts, to do things that other children seemed to manage without much thought, certainly without the terror that immobilised me at the prospect of failing in tasks where success was the norm, such as tying shoelaces. The other day my garden was invaded by rabbits. I wasn't in the least terrified, after all I have seen worse in my time, though I notice that by way of excusing my failure to act I have just said "rabbits" when in fact I saw only one, and there may have been only one--a large one, however--which nevertheless ran away when challenged by a territorially outraged squirrel. If there had been a plague of rabbits I doubt if I'd have done anything about it except hurry slowly to the telephone. The dripping tap, the puncture, the broken lock, the rat in the yard, even the light bulb that burns out in a fairly inaccessible socket, I take these problems under consideration and do nothing. Here, alone in a house with more rooms than I can use, I can close a door on broken chairs, bury my blank tax return deep in a chaotic filing cabinet, easily lose my keys or my diary. All this may be attended to, with much shouting, groaning, and cursing, another day, when it has become obvious that it must be, and that nobody else is going to do it. </p>

<p>
</p><p><p>Introduction: Clothes, Colour and Meaning</p>
</p><p>In Degas's The Cotton Market, New Orleans (illus. I), the radiant fluff of new cotton on the table, which seems made of the white light that illumines it, contrasts distinctly with the black figures of the connoisseurs and potential buyers. One of them holds up to a colleague a spray of new cotton, with a movement he might make in a different kind of painting - offering a chalice to someone he admires (but his stance here is less celebratory: he has one foot up on the seat of a chair). Everywhere in the painting different blacks play against different whites: top-hat, shoe-leather, darkness (the fireplace); cotton, paint, paper, daylight (the window). With its calm recession of people and rectangles, its space and high ceiling, its even clear light, the painting sees a certain grace in the world of business. The men in their black suits are at their ease, assaying, appraising, comfortable in acumen; the black man in black, leaning on a sill, appraises the appraisers. It is the world of men and money, in which a dazzling raw material (which would, a few years earlier, have been tended on the plantation by the enslaved parents of the negro) is traded before being transformed into clothes - into such radiant white shirts as all the men are wearing, notably the clerk in shirt-sleeves on the right, writing in a ledger with a fastidious expression. (Later, thrown away as rags, the same material might become paper, or newspaper.) And the painting reflects the values of clothes. The men's black has its formality, however much the men are at ease. It reflects position, whether they are owners or employees; it reflects also their impersonality of expertise. They owe it both to themselves and to their situation to wear this common colour so. The man in the light jacket, at the end of the table, is not of them: he is perhaps a grower, waiting with a concerned stare to know the price the cotton may fetch. He has the produce, but they, at this point, have the power.
</p><p>The people not shown are women, though the cotton on the table will be transformed chiefly into dresses for women, especially into muslin, which many of the women attached to these men will be wearing, in their world: at home, in their gardens, or out (accompanied). They will be wearing mainly white - in the New Orleans sun they will be radiant at least as the new cotton here - as the men are wearing mainly black. And if their white shows both that they are not in service (unless the white is an apron), and also is virtue, more precious than the costliest muslins, made from the best cotton trade prices can fetch, still the men's black will pull rank. It has gravity, authority.
</p><p>One could be struck by the quiet assurance men's black has here. For, five hundred years earlier, in Europe, such a group of men, dressed almost all in black, might well have been monks or friars: the radiant white table might carry sacred things. They would have been clerics - or they would have been mourners. Five hundred years earlier still they would, simply, have been mourners: and then the white long shape on the table, which has, broadly, human proportions, would have been the body, wrapped in its white winding- sheet. They would not, then, have sat so casually; and they would not have been only men. There would have been both men and women in black, grieving together. For if this book is about one gender and one colour, it is because the curious metamorphosis that has occurred in the use of black cloth - that is, the empowerment of black - has occurred primarily in men's dress (for obvious reasons), while women have tended, almost until the present century, to be left with the grieving and penitential use of black. Even when brilliant, rich, powerful women have worn magnificent black in the past, they have usually needed the pretext of mourning to do so. And what has seemed to me a curious point of interest for study is the way in which, through time, the use of this colour - the colour that is without colour, without light, the colour of grief, of loss, of humility, of guilt, of shame - has been adopted in its use by men not as the colour of what they lack or have lost, but precisely as the signature of what they have: of standing, goods, mastery. The subject, in other words, involves more than externals. It relates to the relations between people in society, and to the relations between men and women; and to the way in which people display externally what in some ways is a 'dark' interior of human motivation. There is a residual mystery in the process: the connection between black and death is never wholly left behind. Though black has developed dull and workaday uses, as well as smart ones, there has recurringly been a sinister element in the use men have made of black. <br>

</p><p>Men's clothes went black in the nineteenth century. Dickens, Ruskin and Baudelaire all asked why it was, in an age of supreme wealth and power, that men wanted to dress as if going to a funeral. The answer is in this history of the color black. Over the last one thousand years there have been successive expansions in the wearing of black - from the Church to the Court, from the Court to the merchant class. Though black as fashion was often smart and elegant, its growth as a cultural marker was fed by several currents in Europe's history- in politics, asceticism, and religious warfare. Only in the nineteenth century, however, did black fully come into its own as fashion; the most telling witnesses constantly saw connections between the taste for black and the forms of constraint with which European society regimented itself.
</p><p>Concentrating on the general shift away from color that began around 1800, Harvey traces the transition to black from the court of Burgundy in the fifteenth century, through sixteenth-century Venice, seventeenth-century Spain and the Netherlands. He uses paintings from Van Eyck and Degas to Francis Bacon, religious art, period lithographs, wood engravings, costume books, newsphotos, movie stills and related sources in his compelling study of the meaning of color and clothes.
</p><p>Although the twentieth century tastes have moved toward new colors, black has retained its authority as well as its associations with strength and cruelty. At the same time black is still smart, and fashion keeps returning to black. It is, perhaps, the color that has come to acquire the greatest, most significant range of meaning in history. <br>

</ul>

<p>BLACK has been an important colour in men's clothing throughout history, much more so than in women's. At certain periods in European history black even became the prevailing male colour. The symbolic value of black in this connection is both inky and potent, going well beyond the normal expression of grief and common courtesy toward death.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Male authority, male cruelty and malice, male hypocrisy and depravity, but also male self-discipline and surrender to duty; male reserve and male zeal; male judgment and learning, not to mention male beauty, moral excellence, emotional depth and commercial probity have all at one time or another appeared suitably manifest in black clothes on men.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sartorial mysteries of masculine black are imaginatively discussed by John Harvey, who focuses his story on black's remarkable climax in the 19th century. In France, England and America, the male figure blackened as that century advanced, causing sensitive literary men to shiver at the spectacle of their sex in universal mourning. Gone were the brilliant waistcoats and pale trousers of the early decades of the century, gone the green and blue coats, the stripes and bright buttons of England's Regency and France's Directoire, gone even the cheerful smocks once seen in the countryside. Urban gentlemen, respectable professionals, shop-clerks and waiters all came to wear black, day or night, followed by farm labourers and tradesmen in rural towns and villages. Everywhere men were wearing the colour of loss and death, while the vital enterprises of imperial and commercial expansion, along with political and social reform, were churning and booming. What was going on?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Harvey's explanation starts with the blackness of puritanical renunciation, which he believes was commonly linked to clerical and, later, financial acumen, as if God smiled on the accumulation of riches by frowning on their enjoyment. But, if tense and righteous Christian virtue was one prevailing spirit behind the infinitude of black frock coats, there must also have been loving and generous men who mourned that fact, together with morose wretches who suffered from it, all of whom were wearing their black with a difference.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sure enough, Mr Harvey soon brings to bear Dickens's motley cast of black-clad men (and some women), well explored against the smoke and fog of Victorian London. He has delved here before in a wonderful book published in 1970, "Victorian Novelists and their Illustrators", where he argued that black-and-white illustration confirmed in printer's ink the darker spirit of the age: the widespread dread that lurked behind the precarious wealth, the heady progress and the ferocious decorum.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, however, Mr Harvey aims to explain more generally the insistence of black in the bodily imagery of masculine power. He notes, for example, that at crucial periods in history troupes of men with a shared purpose have cloaked the diversity of class and personality behind a uniform refusal of tint. Whether that purpose was brutally physical or spiritual and moral, an impersonal black garb indicated personal submission to the common will.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Deep grief in high places has at times set the fashion and usurped the moral high ground. The sorrowing black assumed by Philip the Good of Burgundy, Philip II of Spain or Catherine de M&eacute;dicis of France was copied both as the black of lofty spiritual privilege and as the black of insolent chic. These emotional shades of black survive in contemporary dress for both sexes, with Satanic black present since the beginning. But the balance has shifted. Mr Harvey rightly observes that black has less punch now for men than for women, and it tends to be worn fashionably by the comparatively powerless or less well-off.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The effects of black or white clothes on the black skin of either sex are not much taken up by Mr Harvey, although he deals with black skin as a garment (Othello) and with blackened skin (actors playing Othello). He gives examples from Japan and China, Greece and Russia, and deals briefly with Jewish and Muslim black clothes, though African or Indian uses for black male clothing are passed over. This book is nevertheless wide-ranging without being long, and is graceful in tone. Mr Harvey acknowledges that his arguments are useful speculations, impossible to prove. His modesty and intelligence are convincing, and his scholarship, despite a minor slip or two, is impressive.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Two extraordinary events occurred at the turn of the twentieth century that
helped determine the starting point of the present anthology: the founding of
the modern Olympic Games in 1896 and the introduction of the Australian
crawl to Europe and America in 1902. Together, I have learned, these
developments revolutionized the sport of swimming and gradually changed
public attitudes toward health, decency and morality.
<p>The modern Olympic movement was founded in 1896 by Baron Pierre de Coubertin. De Coubertin perceived a weakness in the character of his French compatriots, debilitated by the Franco-Prussian War, that he believed athletic competition could overcome. England's experience with swimming convinced him that the body, the mind, and the spirit are enhanced by participation in sports; win or lose, he believed, athletic activity could build both self-esteem and respect for others. By building individual character, furthermore, a modern Olympic movement could promote a more peaceful world; in ancient Greece war was suspended for the duration of all Olympic contests.</p>
<p>When the Olympics were revived (as in ancient times, for men only) in Athens in 1896, swimming was included for the first time. The preferred strokes were the breaststroke and the newly introduced trudgen stroke, a double overarm stroke combined with the traditional scissors kick. In 1900, backstroke events were instituted. Richard Cavill introduced the flutter kick, overarm Australian crawl to England in 1902 by swimming 100 yards in 58.6 seconds, a speed no breast- or trudgen stroker could hope to match. In 1904, therefore, the breaststroke and the crawl were made separate Olympic events. Diving was introduced in 1908, and in 1912, women joined Olympic competition.</p>
<p>The introduction of the crawl soon turned swimming enthusiasm from endurance to speed. Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century, while swimming in England and the United States had become increasingly popular, the emphasis was on distance and the focus was the English Channel. When Captain Matthew Webb succeeded in swimming from Dover to Cap Gris-Nez on August 24, 1875, he became famous throughout the world for accomplishing what had been thought an impossible feat; not satisfied with the Channel record, he tried to swim the rapids above Niagara Falls in 1883 and died in the attempt. It wasn't until 1911, thirty-six years after Webb's crossing, that another man succeeded in swimming the Channel. Gertrude Ederle revived public interest in distance swimming when, in 1926, she became the first woman to cross the Channel; since then, interest has continued to grow. Today a worldwide professional circuit exists for open-water swimming competition.</p>
<p>Recreational swimming was traditional for boys and men in England and the United States throughout the nineteenth century. Even nude swimming was considered a natural activity until swimming began to attract women and girls in the second half of the century. Female swimming quickly came under attack by Victorian moralists and did not regain respectability until after World War I; swimming was alleged to affect the womb and to make it difficult for a woman to conceive or to carry a baby to term. In the early years of the twentieth century, several pioneer women swimmers were arrested at the beach for swimming without stockings or unencumbered by the heavy skirts then in fashion. Exposed female flesh was a scandal, raising fears of unbridled sexuality.</p>
<p>However, certain lonely voices continued to promote the benefits of swimming for health and safety. The YMCA movement sought to teach children and adults to swim, in fulfillment of its mens sana in corpore sano ideal. Glamorous swimming exhibitions by famous swimmers such as Annette Kellerman and Johnny Weissmuller; bare skinned and beautiful, began to open people's eyes to swimming's wider possibilities. By the twenties and thirties, swimming--and especially, the swimming pool--had become positive symbols of status and sexuality epitomized by the movie-star culture of Hollywood that the United States was exporting to the rest of the world. The New York World's Fair of 1939, which predicted the suburban American lifestyle of the second half of the century, included promises of backyard swimming pools. One of its most popular attractions was impresario Billy Rose's spectacular Aquacade, in which Eleanor Holm, a backstroke champion who had been thrown off the 1936 Olympic team for drinking champagne on board ship, delighted audiences with her glittering aquatic displays. It was only a step--a virtuous step--from there to the movies of Esther Williams, who created the athletic-romantic ideal of womanhood with which I and many other young men and women in the late forties and early fifties grew up. Meanwhile, swimming pools had proliferated to such a degree that Ned Merrill, the protagonist of John Cheever's story "The Swimmer" could conceive of them as a river winding across Westchester County.</p>
<p>Today, swimming is enjoyed by millions of people every year, at the beach, in lakes or rivers, at the Y, in public or private pools, and at clubhouses around the world. Its popularity suggested the present anthology. </p>

<h2>In the amniotic mere</h2><ul> <li><a href="8ex227.html">S<font size=-1>PLASH</font>!</a>: G<font size=-1>REAT</font> W<font size=-1>RITING</font> <font size=-1>ABOUT</font> S<font size=-1>WIMMING</font>.&nbsp;  Edited by Laurel Blossom. <br>
</ul>

SWIMMING and writing have a lot in common, writes the fetchingly named Laurel Blossom in her introduction to this unusual collection of verse and prose. Lord Byron was the first Englishman to swim the Hellespont. Paul Val&eacute;ry hailed swimming as "a delight only comparable to love". Scott Fitzgerald wrote, "All good writing is swimming under water and holding your breath." As she gets used to the pool, Ms Blossom's own stroke quickens. "Both swimming and writing", she continues, "engender...[a]...trance-like state in which the imagination flourishes without censor or restraint." Well, yes, but so can bicycling or sitting in a bar. Yet it would be cheap to carp. Ms Blossom's topic is swimming and she has produced a remarkable anthology on a fascinating theme.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A less playful editor might have concentrated on the athletic feats of professional swimmers. But Ms Blossom, a poet first and swimmer second, has wisely chosen to focus on imaginative writing. Some of the characters in these poems and stories--the pompous ass of John Updike's "Lifeguard", or the unfortunate chap in Ray Bradbury's "The Women", for example--barely get their feet wet. Swimming emerges as a far from simple pleasure. The little boy in R. Bruce Moody's tale, "Water", wants to please his father by learning to swim, but is terrified of dying in the sea: "A drop could kill him. Death was moist." The troubled protagonist of Monica Wood's tale, "Disappearing", rather hopes that she will vanish into the water. The swimmer in Maureen Stanton's "Water" loves the honesty of an activity that makes people "look like they were just born: wet and slick and ugly." But in what is arguably the prose highlight of this collection--John Cheever's "The Swimmer"--the main character plunges ever further into deceipt and concealment with each pool he crosses in rich suburbia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms Blossom does even better with the poems--using them to punctuate the collection with a skill that comes from her craft (although she is too shy to include any of her own). They vary in style and tone--from the old-fashioned elegance of A.E. Housman's retelling of the Hero and Leander story, "Tarry, delight", to the bleary haze of James Dickey's hungover swim in "Coming Back to America". Lest readers drown in metaphors, there is wry light relief-- Thomas Lux's "Tarantulas on the Lifebuoy", for example, or a two-line Ogden Nash-like entry by John Ciardi, "On Being Much Better Than Most and Yet Not Quite Good Enough". ("There was a great swimmer named Jack/Who swam ten miles out--and nine back.")
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No book of swimming writing can ignore the strange people who endure hours of pain and monotony in the water: champion swimmers. There are some modestly upbeat essays, like that of a long-distance veteran, Diana Nyad, who writes that "fatigue, pain and huge waves are manageable", but not the cold, which will numb a swimmer's limbs and end the bravest venture in minutes once the temperature drops low enough. Thankfully brief is the unattractive boasting by an Olympic gold-medal winner who writes: "...most swimmers back away from the pain; a champion pushes himself on into agony."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But even in the area of competitive swimming Ms Blossom has been careful to keep her poise. A letter from an American adventurer, Richard Halliburton, reminds readers of a time when the only serious swimmers were gung-ho wags who swam great distances with brandy to sustain them. In an extract from "Water Dancer", Jennifer Levin conveys with rhythmic verbal swells the agony of an open-water swimmer who beats a cruel sea, vomiting the whole way. And if you can stomach the symbolic lapping of the lines across the page, Maxine Kumin's poem, "400-Meter Freestyle", is as excellent a description of today's champ as any: one who is so practised that "thrift is his wonderful secret; he has schooled out all extravagance."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By the end, you may well feel like the lad in David Allan Evans's "The Celebration". Although he and his friends have all dived into the same spot in the same lake, Thomas is surprised to find that "every one of us had a different dive, a different story to tell." Ms Blossom has done a terrific job capturing the elusive experience of swimming. If only she or her publishers had thought up a decent title.

</p><p>A startling political and spiritual thriller, Children of Darkness and Light is the brilliant new novel by the author of hopeful Monsters winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year Award.
</p><p>Reports are reaching London that a group of children in Cumbria have seen a vision of the Virgin Mary. Harry, a controversial journalist with a reputation for this line of story, is sent to investigate. He finds complexities multiplying into a range of possibilities - a leak from the local nuclear plant, mutations caused by radioactivity. use or misuse of the children by the authorities, an all-round conspiracy of silence. Most bafflingly, Harry's visit seems to have been expected. his very presence necessary to whatever is to follow.
</p><p>As uncertainty is piled on uncertainty. Harry's reading of the affair changes. The search for understanding draws him back first to London. to his wife and his own child; and then to an assignment in the bloodstained shambles of Bosnia. Here. among an entire people acting out a self-destructive catastrophe, he again follows the trail of a story into the hills. This is a similar story - of a group of children who, for the sake of survival, have banded together against the murderous lunacy of adults. These are children bred of darkness, children who might shed some light, children who might teach their elders the trick of change . . . <br>

ONCE upon a time the English novel was ambitious. In the great era of Dickens, Thackeray and George Eliot, novelists took it upon themselves to invent whole worlds and to people these worlds with busy and credible characters. Now too often the story and the people in it potter about.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On this spring's bookshelves, Graham Swift's "Last Orders" is a prime example. Mr Swift is one of the best known novelists in a generation now in its mid-40s. His finest book is "Waterland", a sweeping evocation of the history and atmosphere of Fenlands England. His latest novel is on a much smaller scale. It tells the story of a group of old friends who are preparing to scatter the ashes of Jack Dodds, a Bermondsey butcher, off the end of Margate pier--as he himself had requested them to do.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In part, "Last Orders" is the story of the men's sombre car journey from East London, through Kent, to the Kentish coast. In part, it is a collection of reminiscences by each of the characters in turn--"Vic", the undertaker, whose establishment had been just across the way from Jack's butchery; Vince, the second-hand car dealer, who had been Jack's adopted son in all but name; "Raysy" the gambler, who had struck up an illicit friendship with Amy, Jack's wife.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Little by little, a portrait of the man and his life emerges--petty, sad, frustrating. Mr Swift's novel captures the language of working-class East London, and convincingly describes the lore of undertaking and butchery--the scenes in the Smithfield meat market are especially well done. But the novel is not opened up by his decision to tell the story through a series of discrete monologues. This technique reduces its potential imaginative scope, and makes it less multifarious, and more bitty and claustrophobic, than it need have been.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nicholas Mosley's "Hopeful Monsters" won literary prizes. He seems unlikely to repeat that triumph with "Children of Darkness and Light". The narrator is Harry, a semi-alcoholic journalist whose marriage may be on the point of collapse. He is a man whose life is governed by intellectual obsessions which take him to the former Yugoslavia, where he investigates claims that a group of children have seen a vision of the Virgin Mary on a hillside, and to Cumbria, where he experiences a deep sense of unease because he appears not only to have been expected but to be known...This is the world of a kind of sub-Kafka--all this deep spiritual unease is supposed to create convincing parables out of a tormented inner life. Mr Mosley gives his readers nothing but drift and pretentious humbug. The monologue form is little more than a mask for a fashionable intellectual incoherence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;James Hawes's " A White Merc with Fins" is set in London and, though written as a first-person narrative, makes a brave attempt to represent the world of a capital city. Mr Hawes is a comedian of manners, and this novel, his first, is a breathless, expletive-stuffed black comedy told by a man of 28 whose London life has hit a nadir of boredom and inconsequence. To remedy this, the hero dreams up an audacious bank robbery that requires the help of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>--only this will rescue him from the receding hairline, the world of the bedsit, the hellish meltdown towards drugs and the under-class. The novel is short enough for the monologue form to retain its force. It possesses briskness, humour and originality.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;D.J. Taylor's third novel, "English Settlement", deserves a better critical reception than it has got, if only because it tries to encompass so much. It is set in the London of 1990. Margaret Thatcher is about to be ousted as prime minister and the Iraqis are sitting pretty in Kuwait. The money men are being toppled from their thrones; the "good times" are over.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The world of Scott Marshall, a young American, is falling to pieces too. He works for <font size=-1>KLS</font>, a predatory management consultancy based in London. Neither his job nor his social life is secure. He moves uneasily through a disconcerting milieu of upper-class girls whose coded language and eccentric behaviour patterns are almost incomprehensible to him. He is haunted by his own past in West Virginia. Why did his father leave his mother? Why did she never talk about her childhood in England?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Half way through the novel, Scott is seconded to a fourth-division English soccer team with instructions to sort out its finances. His discovery of a serious financial swindle puts his own life in danger.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Taylor has taken on much that is difficult here: describing London through the eyes of an arrogant, though often mistaken and bewildered, young American; making sense of the complicated workings of the City without having that knowledge intrude upon enjoyment of the story; and shifting back and forth between America and England in an attempt to chart the differences between their respective national identities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other English novelists need to be reminded of the importance of taking risks of this kind. Reality is not merely--and not principally--what goes on inside our own heads. It is also what we make of what is outside us.

</p><p><p>BERMONDSEY</p>
</p><p>It aint like your regular sort of day.
</p><p>Bernie pulls me a pint and puts it in front of me. He looks at me, puzzled, with his loose, doggy face but he can tell I don't want no chitchat. That's why I'm here, five minutes after opening, for a little silent pow-wow with a pint glass. He can see the black tie, though it's four days since the funeral. I hand him a fiver and he takes it to the till and brings back my change. He puts the coins, extra gently, eyeing me, on the bar beside my pint.
</p><p>'Won't be the same, will it?' he says, shaking his head and looking a little way along the bar, like at unoccupied space. 'Won't be the same.'
</p><p>I say, 'You aint seen the last of him yet.'
</p><p>He says, 'You what?'
</p><p>I sip the froth off my beer. 'I said you aint seen the last of him yet.'
</p><p>He frowns, scratching his cheek, looking at me. 'Course, Ray,' he says and moves off down the bar.
</p><p>I never meant to make no joke of it.
</p><p>I suck an inch off my pint and light up a snout. There's maybe three or four other early-birds apart from me, and the place don't look its best. Chilly, a whiff of disinfectant, too much empty space. There's a shaft of sunlight coming through the window, full of specks. Makes you think of a church.
</p><p>I sit there, watching the old clock, up behind the bar. Thos. Slattery, Clockmaker, Southwark The bottles racked up like organ pipes.
</p><p>Lenny's next to arrive. He's not wearing a black tie, he's not wearing a tie at all. He takes a quick shufty at what I'm wearing and we both feel we gauged it wrong.
</p><p>'Let me, Lenny,' I say. 'Pint?'
</p><p>He says, 'This is a turn-up.'
</p><p>Bernie comes over. He says, 'New timetable, is it?'
</p><p>'Morning,' Lenny says.
</p><p>'Pint for Lenny,' I say.
</p><p>'Retired now, have we, Lenny?' Bernie says.
</p><p>'Past the age for it, aint I, Bern? I aint like Raysy here, man of leisure. Fruit and veg trade needs me.'
</p><p>'But not today, eh?' Bernie says.
</p><p>Bernie draws the pint and moves off to the till.
</p><p>'You haven't told him?' Lenny says, looking at Bernie.
</p><p>'No,' I say, looking at my beer, then at Lenny.
</p><p>Lenny lifts his eyebrows. His face looks raw and flushed. It always does, like it's going to come out in a bruise. He tugs at his collar where his tie isn't.
</p><p>'It's a turn-up,' he says. 'And Amy aint coming? I mean, she aint changed her mind?'
</p><p>'No,' I say. 'Down to us, I reckon. The inner circle.'
</p><p>'Her own husband,' he says.
</p><p>He takes hold of his pint but he's slow to start drinking, as if there's different rules today even for drinking a pint of beer.
</p><p>'We going to Vic's?' he says.
</p><p>'No, Vic's coming here,' I say.
</p><p>He nods, lifts his glass, then checks it, sudden, half-way to his mouth. His eyebrows go even higher.
</p><p>I say, 'Vic's coming here. With Jack. Drink up, Lenny.' <br>

<p>
</p><p><p>One</p>
</p><p>You know the story of the children in Yugoslavia who said they had seen the Virgin Mary: she appeared to them on the side of a hill and went on talking to them in the village church in the evenings; the hillside and the church became a shrine. I did a piece on this for the newspaper I was working for at the time - about the susceptibilities and projections of adolescent children, the local political situation from which the authorities might welcome a diversion, church rivalries in which the Franciscans might be using the children in their battle with the state-backed clergy. My editor said 'But people don't want this analytical stuff; they want a piece about children who say they've seen the Virgin Mary.'
</p><p>I said 'But people don't believe that, do they?'
</p><p>'Part of them will want to believe. Part of them will think it's rubbish.'
</p><p>'So they won't have to think at all.'
</p><p>'You'll learn.'
</p><p>So I went and wrote a piece about the wonderment of the children on the side of the hill; the ruthlessness of church and state authorities in their treatment of the children. I managed to make the harassment of the children seem vaguely sexual.
</p><p>My editor said 'You're learning.'
</p><p>I said 'But the interesting thing is what the Virgin Mary seemed to be saying. She said that humans, with their greed and violence, are in danger of destroying themselves: this is the last time she'.going to appear to give warning.'
</p><p>The editor said 'You don't believe that, do you?'
</p><p>'She goes on and on about the need for prayer and fasting. But people have been trying that for centuries, and it doesn't seem to work.' I added 'I mean, I think this language is some sort of metaphor.'
</p><p>The editor gave me a look as if I might not last much longer with his newspaper.
</p><p>I wrote yet another piece on what I myself felt about the story in terms of it being a metaphor. I said that the Virgin Mary must know that her instructions weren't working because they had been tried so often and had been ineffective; what she must really want was for us, her children, to recognise this and grow up and start working things out on our own. I added that a metaphor was a way oftalking about practical things that could be looked at in no better way.
</p><p>I had become friendly with a local clergyman who was on the editorial board of an avant-garde religious magazine. I rang him up and said 'Why is it that what the Virgin Mary says in these appearances is always so boring?'
</p><p>He said 'Perhaps she wants us to see that it's boring, so we'll begin to work things out for ourselves. But she can't say that, or we wouldn't be working things out for ourselves.'
</p><p>I said 'But that's just what I'm saying!'
</p><p>He said 'Then it seems to be working, doesn't it.'
</p><p>He got my piece published in his religious magazine. It seemed that no one paid much attention to it.
</p><p>I had a girlfriend at the time who was called Melissa. Melissa was a student at an art school: I hadjust started in this my first job with a newspaper. Melissa and I were living together in two rooms in north London. Melissa became pregnant. I said 'Now what do we do - a bit of fasting and self-laceration, or do we think for ourselves.'
</p><p>Melissa said 'It's me we're talking about, not the Virgin Mary.' <br>

</p><p><p>1. How to Get to Moscow</p>
</p><p>Brady wanted a real gun, he insisted on a real gun, the big meathead bounced up and banged on the table with his big meatball fists and roared he was out if he didn't get a real fucking gun. So I hopped up too, I knocked my chair backwards accidentally on purpose and stuck all my knuckles on the table like a baboon and put my face within loafing distance of his and yelled back: - Shut up and listen to the Plan! <br> - You can't rob a bank with a plastic fucking cap gun! - What the fuck do you know about robbing fucking banks? - Well I fucking know you don't rob fucking banks, with plastic fucking cap- guns! Great fucking plan!
</p><p>This was serious. I had let myself get into the F-word thing with Brady, and now it was my round again, and we were already close to saturation. - Is nice big heavy plastic, says Chicho. - Look! - I don't give a fuck how fucking big it is (Brady was tempted, his eyes wobbled, but he knocked the gun away, he looked like a lobster on speed by now) and I don't give a fuck about the fucking plan, I am not fucking robbing Michael fucking Winner's private fucking bank with a plastic fucking cap-gun!
</p><p>I knew it.
</p><p>I knew I should never have told Brady it was Michael Winner's private bank. It isn't really, I only said that to pepper things up a bit for Christ's sake, does everything have to get taken literally? Now Brady is sure the bank will be guarded by Charles Bronson, he just KNOWS everyone will have blood-bags and jerk-wires and stuff.
</p><p>Brady is a Reservoir Dog fetishist, God help us, he thinks doggy-fashion means dressing up like Harvey Keitel, if Quentin Tarantino farted in a bucket, Brady would queue for the bootleg video, he gets his Dog-rig on and rides round the Circle Line with a shower of sad cronies, that is the story of his life. There is only one way to deal with a paid-up psycho like Brady, so I snatched up the plastic cap-gun and prodded its red plastic snout into his big broken nose:
</p><p>- You have been listening to absofuckinglutely fuck all have you, fuck you you fucking dull fucker, the whole fucking point is that it's fucking obviously not a real fucking gun, any fucker with half a fucking brain can see that, underfuckingstand you monufuckingmentally fuck-faced fucking fuckwit!
</p><p>There.
</p><p>Nuked him. Total saturation. Even Brady had to take a breath to digest that lot. Time to strike:
</p><p>- Look, OK, OK, I said. -You can wear the Dog stuff.
</p><p>- Yeah? says he, blushing with hope and shame. <br>

</p><p><p>Pretzel logic</p>
</p><p>Have you ever nearly choked to death on a fragment of seafood? I did once: the incident is etched on the surfaces of my mind in plunging, ineradicable contours, something for ever stirring down there in the compost of memory. It happened in the most expensive fish restaurant in Manhattan, a venue of high, empurpled windows and sleek, executive heads. The immediate witnesses were neither friends nor relatives, in whose company this embarrassment might have been barely tolerable - a quaint footnote to the parchments of family history, say, a reminder of mortality sent to barb a de-energised acquaintance - but my employer, a man named Daniel J. Hassenblad, and two senior vice-presidents of the Chase Manhattan Bank.
</p><p>Often thinking about this inglorious episode, piecing together sensation and detail in the quiet of the obsessive's mental cell, I have wondered about these two characters, encountered neither before nor since, and the reason for their attendance that lunch-time in the upper room of Balaraj's, with its noiseless waiters and its scintillating view out across the crowded Manhattan skyline. For these were august and venerable gentlemen, silvery-haired and shrewd, more accustomed to dining in private rooms accompanied by senators and fiscal regulators than in public with the proprietor of a nine-man computer consultancy and his personal assistant. My current employers, a by no means unrespectable international firm, would happily have given an arm - not their own, perhaps, but somebody's arm - to be able to say that they had entertained two Chase Manhattan top-dogs. They would have framed the check and hung it on the boardroom wall with the Rothko prints .
</p><p>Looking back I can see that enticing them there, in the upper room of Balaraj's, marshalling them together on public display as it were before the silent fish tanks and the crowds of knowledgeable onlookers, represented the profoundest business coup of Danny's career, that in attending to these molten gods and their grave and almost professorial desires the obscure brands of mineral water, the pernickety sideorders - he was a man defined, whipped suddenly out of the rut of prosaic humanity and framed within a rosy, ethereal glow. I appreciate, too, that if Danny was the impresario of this unlikely entertainment, the magician plunging his hands into a series of pocket kerchiefs to draw forth, and oh so effortlessly, coloured baubles, tricoleur flags and teeming wildlife, then I too had a role, if only that of the mute assistant, dutifully allowing himself to be cut in half, to have oranges extracted from his ears, admiring and complaisant. So it is a matter of regret, even now, four years later, that in Danny's hour of symbolic triumph I should so monstrously have failed him, so badly let him down.
</p><p>With hindsight, too, I can see that Danny - poor Danny with his processed hair, the stretched suit proclaiming him a sartorial also-ran - was simply deluding himself, that in responding to his lunch invitation his guests were pursuing not the Hassenblad Consultancy's computing techniques, its network systems and treasury management add-ons, but the spirit of the age. This was the late summer of 1986, the wildest time. People were selling debt that year, grotesque, imponderable debt in six figure bonds; there were lock-up garages on sale in Queens for forty thousand dollars, and adverts in the business press for Master's degrees in Creative Realting. I saw Michael Milken once, in that same restaurant in Manhattan as it happened, and as he stalked purposefully into the thronged lobby, the tribe of flunkies unregarded in his slipstream, the ellipse of faces gathered and then fell away with sacramental awe. It was this scent, I realised, that the Chase Manhattan pair had come in search of, this earthy yet enticing tang that had driven them down from Olympus to the bare level plains populated by Danny and his kind, the tang of money made without effort, through expertise, connection or simple bluff. It was this that had sent them in a gleaming stretch limousine to a distant quarter of their city, and persuaded them to approach the nervous, gesticulating figure of Danny Hassenblad - a man <br>

</p><p>'We head on past the gas works, under the railway bridge. The sun comes out from behind the tower blocks, bright in our faces, and Vince pulls out a pair of chunky sun-glasses from under the dashboard. Lenny starts singing, slyly, through his teeth, "Blue bayooo . . ." And we all feel it, what with the sunshine and the beer inside us and the journey ahead: like it's something Jack has done for us, so as to make us feel special, so as to give us a treat. Like we're off on a jaunt, a spree, and the world looks good, it looks like it's there just for us.'
</p><p>Four men once close to Jack Dodds, a London butcher, meet to carry out his peculiar last wish: to have his ashes scattered into the sea. For reasons best known to herself,Jack's widow, Amy, declines to join them.
</p><p>On the surface the tale of a simple if increasingly bizarre day's outing, Last Orders is Graham Swift's most richly surprising novel to date and his most poignant exploration of the complexity and courage of ordinary lives. A journey on many levels, as universal as it is vividly local, it is moving, funny and humane. <br>

</p><p>THE DAZZLING DEBUT of an immensely exciting new voice in British fiction, A White Merc with Fins speaks, tongue firmly in cheek, eyes wide open and razor sharp, to an entire generation.
</p><p>It's the funny, unexpected story of a 28-yearold with dreams but no focus?, for whom temping has become permanent and home a shack in his sister's London garden. Hobbling from Saturday night to Saturday night, he realises that he is looking at nothing but 30, a receding hairline and a bedsit. The MC (Middle- Class) dream is melting down towards drugs, crime and the underclass.
</p><p>Then the God of temping slips him the keys to Michael Winner's private bank - and The Plan kicks in. It needs a bit of help - Suzy the Black Widow, who drives like she is breathing through the carbs; Brady, the big Reservoir Doggie gobshite; Chicho, homesick for garlic and charcoal heaven - and, courtesy of Mr Supaservice, a white Merc with fins. Oh yes, and something seriously macho, something he can only get from some people he half wishes he didn't know ...
</p><p>How, and how well, he pulls it off is the action that propels this funny, acutely observant, completely captivating first novel. <br>

<p>
</p><p><p>'Would you like my life? Would you? Really?'</p>
</p><p>Nervously monitored from a twelfth-floor eyrie near Blackfriars, Scott Marshall's world looks as if it's falling apart. It's late 1990 in the City of London, the Iraqis are in Kuwait, the Old Lady's sick (Mrs Thatcher, not the Bank of England) and the wild times are over. The only thing a thirtysomething Anglo-American with a job at KLS, the legendary predatory management consultants, an eating phobia and some exalted social connections can do is sit tight and weather the storm.
</p><p>Walham Town, the struggling fourth division football side ('We're not one of your glamour clubs') now launched on an unlooked-for cup-rum by their megalomaniac chairman, seems a safe bolt-hole. But Walham's shattered finances harbour a nest of deceit and subterfuge. Meanwhile secretive, anonymous Miranda is steadily rearranging Scott's emotional life, his father's plans to visit have released all kinds of ghosts from their shared past, and his boss's intrigues with a brace of City cronies may or may not redound to his advantage.
</p><p>As these parallel lines start to converge, Scott's position turns ever less secure. Walham's unlikely progress towards Wembley, the KLS boardroom showdown, the truth about Miranda - each has the capacity to explode some deeply cherished assumptions about English life. The arrival of Scott's ailing father, with some bizarre ideas on how to spend his vacation, could hardly come at a worse moment...
</p><p>Taking place on a pontoon bridge between America and England and supplying an insider's view of how the City works, D.J. Taylor's third novel is a penetrating examination of national identity (on both sides of the Atlantic), missed connections in family life, and the way we behave to the people we love. <br>

<p><b>The state of Jewry</b></p>
<h2>Today in Jerusalem</h2><ul> <li><a href="9ex260.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> C<font size=-1>ONTROVERSY</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> Z<font size=-1>ION</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Geoffrey Wheatcroft. <br>
</ul>

<p>A WELL-INFORMED layman, Geoffrey Wheatcroft guides the reader gently through the thickets of Zionist history and thought without exhausting him with inaccessible detail. His theme is the impact of Zionism on world Jewry. No conclusions are reached at the end of the journey; only a web of paradoxes. Israel has changed the thinking of Jews everywhere. But is Israel the answer to the "Jewish question"?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Wheatcroft is wondrously fair. The Zionist dream was undoubtedly colonialist--and there were voices warning the dreamers of the injustices to come--but the founding fathers were men of their time, the 1890s, which was the heyday of European imperialism. Israel, in its early years, did some terrible things, but its record was no worse than that of other embattled countries forced to defend themselves. Jews have been brutal to Arabs, but Arabs have been even more brutal to one another. His coldest anger is reserved for western governments, particularly America's, which did so little to offer shelter to European Jewry at its direst time--and then proceeded to expiate their offence at the Palestinians' expense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He delights in ironies and oddities. Theodor Herzl, a founding father, relaxed by listening to the music of Richard Wagner, that eminent anti-Semite. Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary who in 1917 declared his government to be in favour of a Jewish national home in Palestine (while ambiguously decreeing that this should not affect "existing non-Jewish communities"), told Cosima Wagner (the composer's widow) that he "shared many of her anti-Semitic postulates." Vladimir Jabotinsky, the advocate of physical force in founding the new state, spent his leisure translating Sherlock Holmes into Hebrew.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How has Israel affected the Jewish diaspora, above all in America? The worst predictions of anti-Zionist Jews have not come to pass: Israel has not endangered Jewish interests or stamped Jews as strangers in their native land. Dual loyalty has not proved an intolerable burden. But, as Mr Wheatcroft argues, there is a problem. Jews in the diaspora are passionate supporters of Israel, but most of them have no intention of living there. This puts them in a false position. Since for their own reasons they do not want the discomfort of making <i>aliyah</i>, they are expected to be not only passionate but also uncritical supporters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Israel is by no means the normal Central European state that the 19th-century dreamers envisaged. It is an intensely nationalistic country. Other ironies: most Israelis are descended from people who would not have left their homelands for choice; most Jews have not chosen to go to Israel. The establishment of the Jewish state, Mr Wheatcroft argues, has in many ways complicated, not resolved, the Jewish question. And yet: the very existence of Israel makes Jews in the diaspora sleep more secure in their beds: they may not want to go there to live but are glad that it is there.

The Jewish Question
<p>A faithless and stubborn generation. Ps.lxxxvii.9</p>
<p>Around the time of Ashley's letter, the Damascus incident, and the Berlin pamphlet, a new phrase appeared, as name and concept. In 1842, Bruno Bauer published Die Judenfrage, 'The Jewish Question', taking a hostile look at the Jews, but the name must have been in currency before then. Despite some continuity between the Jew hatred of the old regime and more recent growths, this Jewish Question could not have existed before the French Revolution. It was a function not of traditional ostracism and oppression but of emancipation. And it scarcely affected, directly or to begin with, the traditional, unemancipated masses who were still the great majority of Jews in the East. 'There is a sense', as Isaiah Berlin puts it, 'in which no social problem arose for the Jews so long as rigid religious orthodoxy insulated them from the external world. Until then, poor, downtrodden and oppressed as they might be, and clinging to each other for warmth and shelter, theJews of eastern Europe put all their faith in God and concentrated all their hope either upon individual salvation - immortality in the sight of God - or upon the coming of the Messiah whose approach no worldly force could accelerate or retard. It was when this great frozen mass began to melt that the social and political problem arose.'</p>
<p>The social and political problem was thus a paradoxical by-product of Enlightenrnent, of Revolution, of emancipation, of all the forces produced by and with the new industrialism which was gradually transforming Europe. It was the misbegotten offspring of liberalism, the doctrine which was spreading across Europe alongside economic change, with its programme of freedom of religion, of the press and of trade, of a rational rule of law, of constitutional representative government. This programme came often to be linked with nationalism, although there was no necessary connection: in the generation following Waterloo, there was an increasingly vigorous liberal movement in Italy, for example, but, whatever later nationalist historians asserted, before 1848 it had little to do with any demand for the unification of Italy as a national state.</p>
<p>Jewish emancipation was an instinctive part of the liberal programme. It came at different paces in different places: to Holland in 1796, to Belgium in 1833, to some German states in the 1830s, to Denmark and Piedmont in 1848. In England the barriers against unbaptised Jews participating in national life came in fits and starts as the old Anglican monopoly crumbled. Emancipation brought with it great opportunities for the Jews of the West not available to their kindred in the East, but it also brought agonies and dilemmas unknown in the ghetto. These were especially acute in Germany; the Jewish story is intimately connected with German history. And the 'Jewish Question' is dominated in the middle of the nineteenth century by German Jews, though illuminated also by the career of an English Jew </p>

After centuries of dispersion from their ancient home, of persecution and of
degradation, the Jews were gradually emancipated in the nineteenth century But
high hopes were dashed, as antisemitism, stimulated by the new nationalism
sweeping Europe, took over from the old religious Jew-hatred. All too often,
Jews found themselves still despised and rejected, strangers in the land where
they lived, haunted by the 'Jewish Question'.
<p>A succession of Jewish prophets now dreamed a new dream. In 1896, the Viennese journalist Theodor Herzl published The Jewish State. It proposed an astonishing answer to the Jewish question: Jewish nationalism or Zionism. The Jews should recognise that they were not a religious group merely, but a true nation waiting to be reborn. They should return to their ancestral home in the Land of Israel. Meantime, the poor downtrodden Jews of Tsarist Russia were fmding another practical 'Zion' across the Atlantic, and in numbers which would entirely alter the Jewish story.</p>
<p>A 'Jewish homeland' was created in Palestine, which became a Jewish state, though only after the Jewish people had undergone the most terrible catastrophe in their history. This new state was born out of physical struggle, but also after fierce controversy. There were Jews who hated Zionism, and antisemites who welcomed it.</p>
<p>Today, there is a Jewish state which is a source of deep pride to those Jews--the majority--who live outside it. But, as this remarkable and original book shows, it is also a source of anxiety. For all the astonishing achievements of Israel, Zionism did not so much 'answer the Jewish question', as Herzl claimed it would, as complicate it still further. </p>

After several years' writing freelance for various newspapers including the Daily Mail, the Guardian and the Independent on Sunday, as well as American papers and magazines, he is now a columnist with the Daily Express.</p>
<p>He and his wife Sally Muir, a fashion designer, live with their young daughter and son near Bath, where he spends as much time as he can watching cricket and racing, fishing, and collecting books. </p>

<p>By Ikko Shimizu; translated by Tamae Prindle.<br>
<i>M.E. Sharpe; 296 pages;</i> <i>$50 and &#163;39.95</i><br>
</p><br>
<p><b>Extract</p></b>
<p>
</p><p><p>Translator's Introduction</p>
</p><p>"I want to describe the many people who are directly involved in business," says Ikko Shimizu, pioneer of the industry novel (kigyo shosetsu), a sub-genre of the Japanese business novel (keizai shosetsu). As the name suggests, industry novels pertain more specifically to industries than do business novels, which cover a broader spectrum of socioeconomic issues.
</p><p>Born in Tokyo in 1931, Shimizu attended Waseda University. As a freelance writer, he contributed to stock market journals before bursting onto the literary landscape in 1966 with his novel The Stock Market: Fiction (Shosetsu Shima), an instant bestseller. He has since published some 100 novels and almost as many short stories. His Artery Archipelago (Domyaku retto, 1975) was awarded the twenty-eighth Japanese Mystery Writers Association Prize. A good two dozen of his works have been turned into films and television dramas. Today, he is one of Japan's most prolific and popular novelists. As Shimizu notes, Japanese industry novels are "young," dating only to the mid-1960s. The distinctive feature of these novels is their "immediacy to the business world." The stories expose the internal mechanisms of business transactions and the mentality of the people involved, making technical information accessible to a lay audience and convincing even to economists. "Silver Sanctuary" begins with the discovery of a breach of confidentiality in the administration of three confidential long-term savings accounts. A type of account unfamiliar to most Westerners, it is opened under a pseudonym and utilized primarily for tax purposes. The customer's real name and address are known only to a very limited number of bank employees. Transactions on the account are carried out by means of a registered stamp (inkan) bearing the customer's pseudonym. Shimizu has taken a special interest in this peculiar system.
</p><p>"Silver Sanctuary" unravels the tenuous interpersonal and interinstitutional relationships to be found in the banking world. At the personal level, there are two career paths: vertical and horizontal. Only executives-in-training have the privilege of promotion beyond the level of division head. Hence, personnel rotation brings about psychological tension among employees, who are like cogs in a wheel turned by the institution. The cogs are subject to the basic principle that "a banker must be trustworthy and almost impartially serious, and at the same time have no idiosyncrasies." Women are expected to play a secondary role.
</p><p>The dramatic present of "Silver Sanctuary" is the early 1960s, almost twenty years after women's suffrage was recognized in Japan (1945) but more than twenty years before the Equal Employment Law passed the Diet (1986). The M-shaped demographic curve of the women's labor force--with women in their early twenties forming the first peak and those in their mid-forties a second but less prominent peak--is already in place. That is, women typically leave their jobs to bear and rear children and subsequently return as part-timers. Misako in "Silver Sanctuary," who marries Tagawa and stays home, lives a more idealized woman's life than does Yoko, the tragic protagonist of the story. The name Yoko, meaning a person who serves, who is constant, even stupid, symbolizes an old maid's social status. And in fact Yoko becomes persona non grata, and even a criminal, after offering everything a woman can to Tagawa, Saeki, her father, and a number of other men. We, along with Tagawa, the elitist banker, get to glimpse the interior of her aching heart. From a more practical standpoint, the rapid turnover among women workers makes the female labor force cost-effective and elastic. All told, "Silver Sanctuary" is a skillful blend of literature and expository reporting.
</p><p>"Silver Sanctuary" (Gin no Seiiki) was first published in the Japanese monthly All Reading (Oru yomimono), January 1969, and was later included in Nine Consecutive Hits (Churen Poton) (Tokyo: Kadokawa Bunko, 1984). The translation here is a revision of the version published in the Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars 17, no. 3 (1985):17-27; Harper's Magazine, June 1986: 27-28; The Other Japan, ed. E. Patricia Tsunumi (Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 1988),19-29; and Made in Japan and Other Japanese Business Novels," trans. and ed. Tamae K. Prindle (Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 1989),33-57. <br>

Three young Germans came out to South Africa more than a hundred years
ago to seek their fortune: the brothers George and Leopold Albu, and the
mining engineer Adolf Goerz. They were to found, respectively, General
Mining and Finance Corporation and Union Corporation - the two companies
which would eventually become Gencor, South Africa s second largest business
group, which has today become one of the world's most important mining
houses.
<p>But the Albu brothers - and Goerz, who died young - have been the least recorded of the 'Randlords' who created modern South Africa at the turn of the century. In comparison with Rhodes, Barnato, Beit, and the rest, the Albus have been forgotten. Here, they and their families are resurrected.</p>
<p>This is not a conventional corporate history. JDF Jones has been given a free hand by Gencor in its centenary year to tell - vividly, without discretion - the true story of the group which emerged from the merger of the (Afrikaner) General Mining/Federale Mynbou and the (very English) Union Corporation.</p>
<p>It is a books intended for the general reader, not the specialist, and seeks to set the tale of a giant world corporation against the complex, erratic and sometimes bloody history of South Africa over the same century. JDF Jones believes that the story of one major institution can illustrate, and illuminate, the political and economic history of South Africa in the extraordinary 100 years which span the Jameson Raid to Majority Rule. </p>

<p><b>South African mining</b></p>
<h2>Uitlanders</h2><ul> <li><a href="9ex265.html">T<font size=-1>HROUGH</font> F<font size=-1>ORTRESS</font> <font size=-1>AND</font> R<font size=-1>OCK</font></a>: T<font size=-1>HE</font> S<font size=-1>TORY</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> G<font size=-1>ENCOR</font> 1895-1995.&nbsp;  By J.D.F. Jones.<br>
</ul>

<p>AMONG the least known of the 25 "Randlords", the European emigrants who sailed for South Africa in the late 19th century to make their fortunes in the diamond and gold fields, are George and Leopold Albu, the sons of a Berlin coach-builder, and Adolf Goerz, a mining engineer from Mainz. Yet the companies they founded, General Mining and Union Corporation, were the beginnings of what today is Gencor, South Africa's second-biggest mining house and the world's biggest exporter of steam coal and producer of ferrochrome and titanium dioxide.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Goerz died too young to fill out this story, but the travails of General Mining and the Albu brothers, who as teenagers arrived at the Cape and trekked for 28 days in an ox-wagon to Kimberley, provide intriguing insights into South Africa's shifting ethnic snobberies. The Albus were Jewish, as were 13 of the other 23 Randlords. They were also German and backed by German finance. They fell out with the English Randlords, including Cecil Rhodes, when they disapproved of the Jameson Raid of 1895-96 into President Paul Kruger's Transvaal and they further alienated the City of London when they supported the Boers in the 1899-1902 Anglo-Boer war.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;J.D.F. Jones, a former foreign editor of the <i>Financial Times</i>, suggests that George Albu was the perpetual outsider, torn between a desire to be accepted by the English Randlords and a loyalty to his roots. He suffered doubly, as did the more famous Oppenheimers, first from anti-Semitism and then from anti-German sentiment during the first world war. As George Albu rose up the Johannesburg social ladder, his early charitable commitments--to a German hospital, a Jewish orphanage--waned. By the 1930s, with property in London's West End, a grand mansion in Johannesburg and a hunting lodge in the bush, he had turned himself into a thorough Englishman; and got knighted. Like the Oppenheimers, his family today are Christians.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A generation later, a similar quest by ethnic outsiders for acceptance by the clubby English business world took place--this time, by Afrikaners. Until the 1950s they had been regarded by English-speakers as poor whites, South Africa's barefoot bigots. Thanks to the election of the National Party in 1948, and to the clandestine workings of the Afrikaner Broederbond, today's big Afrikaner companies--Rembrandt, Sanlam, Volkskaas--prospered, and with them a new Afrikaner elite. However, the great challenge was the exclusive world of mining, "which for 75 years had featured the English-speaking members of the Chamber of Mines and of its canteen, the Rand Club in Johannesburg."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wennie du Plessis, an Afrikaner and a Broeder, founded Federale Mynbou in 1953 as a coal-mining concern. But it was William Coetzer who built it up, with the help of state patronage during the apartheid era, into a big diversified mining house which, in 1963, bid for control of the Albus' General Mining. It is often said that Federale Mynbou had Harry Oppenheimer, head of Anglo American, to thank for the deal: he magnanimously sold his stake in General Mining, so the story goes, to help promote Afrikaner business. Mr Jones tells a different tale: Anglo's offer, he says, came with strings that tied Fedmyn to selling its diamonds through De Beers, part of the Oppenheimer empire, and gave De Beers control of any further diamond finds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Only five years later, Tom Muller, the Afrikaner head of the merged General Mining/Federale Mynbou, became president of the Chamber of Mines, a social triumph for Afrikanerdom. By 1980, to the consternation of other English-speaking mining groups, the Afrikaner mining house had seized control of Union Corporation to form Gencor. The symbolism was striking: among the mining houses the <i>arriviste</i> Afrikaners had beaten in the race, a century after the Randlords first arrived on the reef, was Gold Fields of South Africa, heir of Cecil Rhodes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This book has an unintended timeliness. The social tide is shifting again in South Africa. Gencor remains essentially white, but Anglo American is making a great fanfare of selling its stake in a holding company, Johnnic, to black businessmen. However, the really big test of post-apartheid social change will be the appointment of a black head of the Chamber of Mines.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
THE GERMAN RANDLORDS
<p>It is easy to underestimate the role of Germans in the creation of modern South Africa. Because they played no significant political role their interest and involvement in the shaping of events before the First World War - and before the Anglo-Boer War - have sometimes been forgotten. it is less common to understate the role of European Jews in South Africa s economic, if not political, development: sometimes the Jewish presence is over-stressed - the Randlords, for instance, were by no means uniformly Jewish. However, it has been calculated that of the 25 leading entrepreneurs who were involved in the opening up of the Rand goldfields, 15 were Jewish. 11 of the total were from Germany or Austria, and 9 of that latter category were also Jewish. The brothers George and Leopold Albu were Jewish; they and Adolf Goerz were German. The Albus and Goerz were the creators respectively of General Mining and Union Corporation, which many years late were to merge and to become Gencor.</p>
<p>German entrepreneurs, bankers, industrialists and investors had been vigorously interested in South Africa since shortly after the discovery of diamonds in Kimberley in 1869. The Albu brothers and Adolf Goerz. coming from different backgrounds, represent two different varieties of German venturers. George and Leopold Albu had been brought up in a suburb of Berlin where their father, Simon, was a builder and repairer of coaches. They were Sephardic Jews who traced their origins - or so they would later claim - to a mediaeval rabbi who had lived under the protection of the Spanish dukes of Alba and had translated the Pentateuch into Spanish; hence one possible explanation of the family's unusual name. There were four boys, George (born in 1857), Leopold (1859), Felix and Eugen, and two girls, Regina and Eveline. Next to nothing is known about the detail of their childhood in the years when the Prussian army was creating the German Empire. Simon was apparently injured in his work and the family was in difficulty, though the boys were properly educated. George was apprenticed to a haberdasher in Silesia, and it was Leopold, always to be the more impatient of the two, who was the first to respond to the suggestion of their uncle in Kimberley that he come out to see if he could make his fortune on the new diamond fields.</p>
<p>There is a mystery about this uncle. The only Albu known to have been in Kimberley at the time was the first Rabbi of the town's synagogue, which was consecrated in 1876, whom Louis Cohen in his Reminiscences of Kimberley specifically insists was the uncle of George and Leopold. The Reminiscences is one of the most readable (and mischievous) books ever written about South Africa, but Louis Cohen certainly should not be relied upon for perfect accuracy, and his libellous description of a charity concert at the Theatre Royal may be a touch exaggerated: 'The old humbug advanced to the footlights, glared, glinted, and blew his spongy nose with a debauched red handkerchief... Slowly and gravely, with much professional precision, he landed his violin on his left shoulder and played remarkably well a difficult number resplendent with crescendos, quavers and grimaces. Then he stopped to blow his nose again, and waited for applause. It is sad to chronicle that at this particular moment some of the chosen of his flock commenced to hiss, at which the grave and reverend pastor paused and, glowering angrily at the aristocratic assemblage, visited his nose again with thunderous effect. This was too much. We had come to hear Schubert, not sneezing and, the hisses redoubling, the sacred Albu, with eyes flashing like those of a wild cat, deliberately turned his back to the immaculate audience, lifted up the coat-tails of his highly respectable black dress-coat, and applauded himself on that portion of his body which ought to have been well smacked earlier in life...</p>
<p>Worse was to come - the Rabbi Albu was fired, but, as Louis Cohen continues, 'the Holy Man got his revenge. He took a single-roomed office in Endell Street, where he ate, drank, and slept, shaking his elbow all the time, and regularly on a Saturday, as his whilom flock wended their way to school, he would stand at his habitation's door, kissing his fingers to them, unkempt, dirty and unshaven, smoking a filthy old pipe, and puffing like a steam boat. It is asserted, too, that on a certain eventful Yom Kippur morning he was seen vigorously cutting into a ham, and exclaiming with gusto as he did so "I'll show you how to keep Yom Kippur"...'</p>
<p>At least this gives the flavour of life in early Kimberley: the Rabbi does not feature again in the family archives, which is probably not surprising. </p>

JORGE LUIS BORGES is one of the seminal figures in twentieth-century
literature. His influence on the art of narrative, on the very way people think
about writing, has been incalculable. All post-war fiction, from Garcia Marquez
to Fuentes, Updike to Barth, Burgess to Barnes, Calvino to Eco, bears Borges's
imprint--yet the singular irony about the complete works of this idiosyncratic
Argentine radical is that they contain no novels.
<p>Spending his early youth in Europe, it was in the late 1930s in Buenos Aires that Borges embarked on the short stories on which his reputation is based. Ficciones and El Aleph were cryptic, playful, vertiginously imagined, and constitute his, and Latin America's, benchmark volumes. Fame came to him only in the 1960s. Blind, living with his mother--who died just ten years before he did--and increasingly unfashionable in his politics, Borges attracted extraordinary international, often controversial, attention right up until his death in Geneva in 1986.</p>
<p>THE MAN IN THE MIRROR OF THE BOOK is the first biography to be written in English since Borges died, and from it emerges a picture of a complex man who neither courted fame nor ever acknowledged the literary revolution he set in train. Based on first-hand research in Buenos Aires, James Woodall's portrait depicts a Borges the world never saw; the young pamphleteering poet obsessed by Walt Whitman and Argentine slang; the sexually timid intellectual falling disastrously in love just as he was writing his finest prose; the guru of Latin-American letters whose sole aim in old age was domestic happiness.</p>
<p>Throwing new light on the background to the stories and the poetry, James Woodall also looks at Buenos Aires itself, and at the two grand obsessions of Borges's life: his celibate love of women, and his loathing of Argentine's most charismatic dictator, Juan Peron.</p>
<p>THE MAN IN THE MIRROR OF THE BOOK is a timely portrait of a writer whose magnificent capacity to startle and disturb remains as bright today as it was at the height of his powers. </p>

<p>BLIND Milton dreamt of paradise; Jorge Luis Borges, the finest writer Argentina has produced, filled his own blindness with mysterious streets, twilight gardens, metaphysical conundrums, hoaxes, and infinite catalogues of dusty books on the shelves of forgotten libraries. A man who lived to be troubled by Isabel Peron and the Falklands-Malvinas war (memorably described by him as "two bald men fighting over a comb"), remained, to himself, a Victorian, living with his mother into old age and retaining the courtesies and gallantries of the era in which he was born.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His life went on in his head, fiercely and sharply imagined. Outside that, he worked as a librarian, ate soup and steak, took his siesta, worked again, dined with friends, and spent insomniac nights. His journeys round the world to meet his adoring acolytes were sightless from his fifties onwards. On a visit to St Andrews in 1971 he asked to be left to meditate by the North Sea; a friend found him later facing the wrong way, and gently turned him round.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Borges's life was not only defiantly internal; it was a teasing double existence, in which the private man treated the public writer as a different, irritating being. "Borges", the public man, was clever, a bit of a braggart, the lion of caf&eacute; society in Buenos Aires, Geneva, Seville and New York; the private man wished only to stay in his apartment, his mother's son, fingering old maps and manuscripts, keeping out of the light. Although he was obsessed by repetition and tricks of time, he loathed any repetition of himself. From childhood he avoided mirrors, and professed himself afraid even of "crystals, mahogany and limpid water". He dreaded losing control of himself, whether in drink, drugs or sex, and eschewed all of them. Restraint was to be desired in everything; especially in writing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mario Vargas Llosa once commended Borges with saving Spanish from its natural excess. Borges was well equipped to do so, since his first experience of language was English. As a child, he read Cervantes in an English translation and romped through Wells, Twain and Stevenson; as an old man, he loved best to hear the works of Kipling and Gerard Manley Hopkins. His love of English went right to its roots, to Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse, which he began to study in his sixties. The headstone of his grave in Geneva is inscribed <i>"and ne forhtedon na" (</i>and should not be afraid<i>)</i>, a quotation from the Anglo-Saxon "Battle of Maldon". While elsewhere in Latin America the magical-realist writers seemed possessed by heat and fever, flowers and blood, Borges retained always the cool detachment of the European north.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet he believed in magic as deeply as the rest. He did not try to write naturalistic fiction until he was old, insisting there was no "integrity" in it. The typical Borges story (as seen in "Labyrinths", "Fictions", or "The Aleph", his three greatest works) is of a musty volume, discovered in a library, which offers clues to the history of a strange imaginary country. This is fiction dressed as non-fiction, or even as scholarly research, but with an overlay of mischief. Borges once supposed he would write novels, but settled on short stories because they were easier to control. Later he turned to poetry because, blind as he was, he could hold the metrical structures longer in his memory.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is clear that Borges is not an easy biographical subject. The task has become harder in recent years, as his widow and relations have exercised tyrannical control over his estate. Nonetheless, James Woodall makes quite a mess of it. He was frustrated in several avenues of his research, and seems to have sulked as a result, refusing to explore other paths that might have been useful: above all, Borges's own writings. Mr Woodall remarks early on that to try to fish biographical fragments out of the stories is "a dead end". Maybe so, but it is also true that all Borges is in his writings, sprouting like bizarre tendrils out of the mundane life. It would not take great imagination to enjoy the contrast between, say, the precisely described streets and corners of these imaginary worlds and the streets of Buenos Aires, whose tiniest details and moods Borges recognised even when he wandered them in darkness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But like Borges, so often paralysed before real life, Mr Woodall is paralysed before his subject, resorting to mind-numbing lists of literary acquaintances and minor publications, mangling both his own English and Borges's immaculate syntax, and refusing either to give the book a sense of place, or to let it breathe. One particularly important example will suffice. To the west of Buenos Aires, even pressing into its outermost suburbs, lie the vast pampas. Like all Argentines, Borges breathed them and dreamed them. He thrilled himself with gaucho romances, especially the Argentine epic "Martin Fierro"; he recalled that a gunfight witnessed in a dusty pampas town "impressed me far more than the kingdoms of the world". The "horizontal vertigo" of the plains surely influenced the bizarre spatial planes of his earlier stories, just as gaucho violence is strewn through his later ones. Yet the pampas are never once described for the reader, even in Borges's words. Reading this biography, you are made blind yourself; yet not, alas, with Borges's imagination to save you.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Chapter One
1899-1914
Quiet Days in Palermo
<p>The country that Borges was born into in 1899 was new. Centuries of Spanish rule in Argentina had ended only eighty three years before, with the Congress of Tucuman in 1816. The middle of the nineteenth century was then riven by frontier and civil wars, in which members of Borges's family on both sides had been engaged. Many made their way, memorialised or transformed, into his poems and stories.</p>
<p>Manuel Isidoro Suarez, born in-1799 and the grandfather of Borges's mother, Leonor Acevedo, was one of the greatest of his warrior antecedents. He fought in most of the wars of independence in the early 1800s - in Chile, Peru, Uruguay and excelled under Simon Bolivar. He was also associated with the Unitarians, those who opposed the dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas and his Federalist faction (in spite of the fact that Suarez was a second cousin of Rosas's): this conflict and Rosas's reigns of terror until 1852 were to mark mid- nineteenth-century Argentina rather as Peron and the generals were to in the mid-twentieth.</p>
<p>Suarez settled in Uruguay, marrying in 1834 a woman from a local patrician family, called Jacinta Haedo. An immediate relative of hers - Jorge Luis's great- great-uncle - was another military man, Miguel Estanislao Soler, who had fought alongside the great Argentine liberator, General San Martin, and became governor of Buenos Aires in 1820. The Suarezes had a daughter, Leonor Suarez Haedo, born in 1837, who married a man named Isidoro de Acevedo Laprida, who himself took part in the wars against Rosas. Back in a more settled Buenos Aires, their daughter Leonor, Borges's mother, was born in 1876.</p>
<p>Acevedo Laprida was related to Francisco Narciso de Laprida, the man who had convened the 1816 congress of Tucuman, declaring the 'United Provinces of South America' free of Spain. He ended badly in 1829, being hunted down- by Federalist gauchos (basically cowboys) and killed. His body was never found.</p>
<p>About him, as about Suarez and Acevedo Laprida, Borges wrote famous poems, and recalled them frequently throughout his life. His mother's line was thickly populated with military men, and something of their nature came out in Leonor's campaigning character.</p>
<p>His father's side was not lacking in similar figures: Borges's grandfather Francisco Borges Lafinur was at least as colourful as Suarez. Born in 1832 in Montevideo, Uruguay, he was already in the wars at the age of fifteen. He fought under a famous general, and later president, Justo Jose de Urquiza, at the Battle-of Caseros (1852), which marked the final defeat of Rosas. Later he fought in Paraguay, and in frontier wars in the south and the west. This full- blooded, martial Argentineness was mellowed by Lafinur's choice of wife: an English woman called Frances Haslam.</p>
<p>Born in 1842 in Staffordshire of Northumbrian stock, she came to be in Argentina because-her elder sister Caroline had married, Borges tells us in his 1970 'Autobiographical Essay', 'an Italian-Jewish engineer named Jorges Suarez, who brought the first horse-drawn tramcars to Argentina, where he and his wife settled and sent for Fanny'. Unfortunately, Suarez's business ventures failed completely; but Caroline was made of doughty stuff, and earned a living by teaching English. </p>

WHEN CARLOS BAKER died in 1987, he had completed all but the finishing
touches on what will be considered his masterpiece. An esteemed literary critic
and mentor to several generations of younger scholars, Carlos Baker had a
lifelong interest in the writers of the American Renaissance, particularly in
Ralph Waldo Emerson, its intellectual centerpiece, but also in Henry David
Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Amos Bronson Alcott, and Margaret Fuller, all
of whom made Concord a mecca for American intellectuals, with Emerson
undoubtedly its foremost citizen. Lucky for us that in his last years Carlos
Baker poured his resources, wisdom, and affections into this remarkable book.
<p>Emerson Among the Eccentrics is that rarest of accomplishments: a magnificent biography that functions equally as a group portrait and a highly detailed reconstruction of an entire era. Carlos Baker was indefatigable in going through all of the principal characters, journals, and correspondence to reconstruct, minutely, entire days; the result is a vivid and textured mosaic not just of the group's interrelationships but of their daily lives--what they ate, what they wore, what they did for entertainment, what they valued and what they did not, how they "managed" life. All of this, though, went to serve Baker's larger aim and hope of bringing Emerson to life in his quotidian relationships: as young man and old; husband, father, son, and brother; preacher, lecturer, editor, and clubman; farmer, householder, host, and guest.</p>
<p>Carlos Baker, true to form and with genuine affection, produced a beautifully crafted book, by far the most intimate portrait we are likely to get of the Sage of Concord and his remarkable circle of friends. This is biography at its very best. </p>

<p><b>Lives: Emerson</b></p>
<h2>Hitched to a star</h2><ul> <li><a href="7ex184.html">E<font size=-1>MERSON</font> A<font size=-1>MONG</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> E<font size=-1>CCENTRICS</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Carlos Baker. <br>
</ul>

<p>THE lives of the writers, thinkers and hangers-on who surrounded Ralph Waldo Emerson in Concord, Massachusetts, have been dissected so much that the group's central figure is often easy to lose sight of. Even in a work like this, which seeks to put Emerson firmly in his social circle, he towers effortlessly above it: this "celestial", this "beacon", this "god of my idolatry", as Louisa May Alcott called him.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The aim of the Concord group was nothing less than the creation of a culture for a brand-new America. And though Emerson was never convinced that his rambunctious young country had found a voice as eloquent, free and sweeping as it deserved, his followers never doubted it had; and it was his.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He took their worship quietly. As the title of one of his early writings, "Society and Solitude", suggests, Emerson was torn between enjoying and fleeing from the company of his fellows. Try as he might to live in out-of-the-way spots, the world found its way to his gate. He believed that these visitors had a right to "the freedom of your inner house"; he also believed, with equal firmness, that he wished to be "alone with the Alone", in "a barn chamber with a salad or a potato". He was seldom so lucky.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To his close friends he showed great kindness, editing their poems, encouraging their writing, secretly paying the rent on smallholdings where they tried, in the ineffectual way of thinkers, to live farmers' lives. But he was instinctively a cold man, and acknowledged it. The moment the conversation became too intense, or the overtures too personal, he could feel "the crystals shoot and the drops solidify". It was much like the discomfort felt by his friend Henry Thoreau when the group squashed into his tiny cabin at Walden Pond for conversation: it was difficult to keep enough distance between them "when they begin to utter the big thoughts in big words".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Big thoughts there were, in plenty. In many ways the title of this excellent life is misleading; for Emerson was no less eccentric than his friends, merely more circumspect. Every member of the group was wrestling, in his or her different way, to understand the nature of divinity, the "God in nature", and man's relation to him (or it). Although not all were fully-flown Transcendentalists as Emerson was, almost all found the established forms of religion unsatisfactory. As Emerson put it, at about the time he resigned his own pastorate in 1832: "How they can make such a fuss about the case and never open it to see the jewel--is strange, is pitiful." On Sundays, when Concord was at church, Emerson would be in the woods, though taking care that nobody saw him.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even in the mid-19th century, such insistence on a divine immanence in man and nature, with its implied denial of a personal God, was still eccentric, if not blasphemous. Bronson Alcott, Louisa May's father, had to close down his little school after overdosing his charges with Wordsworth and Plato; Jones Very, a wild young poet, had to be suspended from his Harvard post after announcing that "Christ's second coming was in him". Yet Emerson not only protected these men, but carefully cultivated their enthusiasms. To his death he carried a pocket compass with him, not to know his direction, but "to hold the visible god in my hand".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To many of his followers, the "visible god" was already among them. Margaret Fuller, the editor of the short-lived <i>Dial</i>, in which many of the group's writings first appeared, was besotted with Emerson, forever thrusting her face into his, breathily informing him of the "heaving bosom "of nature, and demanding to know whether he loved her. Thoreau, in his strong grey trousers, suited for climbing trees or wading into ponds, a man possessed with "this maggot of Freedom", took the room at the top of the stairs in Emerson's house, happily becoming his odd-job man. Even the quietly sceptical Nathaniel Hawthorne, who first appears in this book with his hat over his handsome eyes, observing the "terrible giant Transcendentalist" at a party, becomes enmeshed with him. Emerson's comment in his journal after Hawthorne's death in 1864 is typical and affecting: "It was easy to talk with him--there were no barriers;--only, he said so little, that I talked too much."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is easy to be moved by these pages. Carlos Baker's triumph in this biography, which was published posthumously, is to draw the reader so deeply into the circle that he, too, becomes a member of it. When characters go off to Europe (many still believing that American culture is too thin a gruel to sustain them), they are missed; when they die, there is genuine regret at their disappearance. And nothing is more unsettling than the decay of the great central tree, Emerson himself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He lived long enough--79 years--to mourn the death of Lincoln, and stayed open-minded long enough to welcome with unreserved joy the appearance of Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" in 1855. Here at last, he believed, was a distinctive poetry worthy of America, words that could "cut and bleed", as he liked them to: even if, as he wrote to Carlyle, some of Whitman's passages "read like an auctioneer's inventory of a warehouse". But in the end it was words that deserted him, so that he could not remember even the name of his wife, and once called his dressing gown "the red chandelier". A year or so before his death, one of his acolytes noted with surprise an "earthliness" in him. The god was, after all, human; Concord was not the promised land. But it had come close enough.

THE BROTHERS
<p>BY THE TIME OF HER DEATH AT AGE EIGHTY-FIVE IN THE fall of 1853, Ruth Haskins Emerson had long been the gentle matriarch of the branch of the family into which she had married in 1796. Having outlived her husband, the Reverend William Emerson, by more than forty years, she had assiduously raised five of the eight children that she had borne to him. Phebe, John Clarke, and Mary Caroline all died in childhood, and their father lived only to the age of forty-two. By 1814, the family consisted of the small and energetic widow and her five sons, ranging in age from thirteen to six. The five brothers were named William, Ralph Waldo, Edward, Robert Bulkeley, and Charles. "She kept her family together," wrote Ralph Waldo after her death, "and at once adopted the only means open to her by receiving boarders into her house." By the early 1830s, with "the assistance of some excellent friends," all but one of the boys had been graduated from Harvard College. As Waldo added, "Her children as they grew up had abundant reason to thank her prudence which secured to them an education. . . I remember being struck with the comment of a lady . . . when some debate arose about my Mother's 'thrift' in her time: 'Ah, but she secured the essentials. She got the children educated."'</p>
<p>In spite of a paternal ancestry in which clergymen had predominated for seven generations, Waldo was the only son who chose that profession, and even he did not stay with it for long. The eldest boy, William, studied theology at Gottingen for a short time in the middle 1820s, but soon dropped his plans in favor of the law. Both Edward and Charles followed his example as if they hoped, after the penury of their boyhood, to succeed in a profession that promised higher monetary rewards than they could have earned through preaching. Or teaching, though William and Waldo, Edward and Charles all served as schoolmasters during or after their college years in order to help support their quietly heroic mother and to minimize their gradually mounting debts.</p>
<p>Apart from the genteel poverty from which they were seeking to emerge, two darker shadows overhung the fortunes of the five brothers. One was tuberculosis, which had killed John Clarke at the eight of eight and hastened, if it did not immediately cause, the father's death in what might have been his prime. Doctors had urged Edward to take a recuperative voyage as early as 1822, and Waldo had been obliged to spend the winter of 1826-27 in South Carolina and Florida in an attempt, luckily successful, to stave off the incursions of the same disease. His young wife, Ellen Tucker, was to die of tuberculosis in 1831 after only a year and a half of marriage, and the health of both Edward and Charles was always precarious owing to persistent weakness of the lungs.</p>
<p>The other shadow was that of mental illness. One March day in 1833, Waldo's cicerone conducted him through the Spedale dei Pazzi, the insane asylum of Palermo. "I did not know where I was going," he wrote in his travel diary, "or should not have visited it. I could not help them and have seen enough of their sad malady without coming to Sicily." Behind his journal entry lay his memories of the McLean Asylum, an American Spedale dei Pazzi in Charlestown, Massachusetts, where two of his brothers had been confined some five years earlier, and one of the two even more recently.</p>
<p>Bulkeley, the fourth of the living sons, was mentally retarded and emotionally unstable. From late adolescence he had been boarded out sporadically, and he divided his time between simple labors on the farmstead of Israel Putnam in Chelmsford, the village where Waldo had taught school in the fall of 1825, and frequent and often prolonged visits to McLean. In a letter sent from Chelmsford in December 1825, Waldo had written, "Bulkeley is perfectly deranged and has been ever since I have been here"--a matter of three months. </p>

<p><b>Global economy</b></p>
<h2>Crystal-ball(s)?</h2><ul> <li><a href="7ex187.html">M<font size=-1>ARKET</font> U<font size=-1>NBOUND</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Lowell Bryan and Diana Farrell. <br>
</ul>

<p>THE authors work for McKinsey, which is arguably the world's most successful management consultancy. It earns its living by selling advice to big companies. To stay big in today's economy you have to know (or guess) not only how many people are going to buy your product tomorrow. You must also know (or take a line on) what is likely to happen virtually everywhere in the world--and not simply tomorrow but over the next ten or 20 years. So in order to satisfy anxious and demanding clients, McKinsey needs to think big thoughts about things to come.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A lot of this thinking goes on under the aegis of what McKinsey calls its global institute, a think-tank in Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>. It has published several impressive studies, most notably on productivity. This book, a more accessible version of a technical report put out last year, is nothing if not ambitious. It tries to answer two complex questions. How much bigger and how much more integrated can the world's financial markets be? And what is their growing power likely to mean for governments?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lowell Bryan knows about banks and Diana Farrell about financial services, so it is hardly surprising that they see in the swelling power of financial markets a force mainly for good. This is because, on their projections, the rich world's citizens are about to save a lot more money just as the developing world, having embraced market economics, is bursting with juicy investment chances. Both worlds might therefore be blessed: the poor with a "productivity transfusion" of capital and know-how; the rich with fat investment returns to see people through old age.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So is everything for the best in the best of all possible financial worlds? The McKinsey forecasters are not so bullish. The rich world's governments may yet mess things up, they believe: many rich countries, having granted their citizens large welfare entitlements, are borrowing ever-larger amounts to pay for them rather than increasing taxes or reducing benefits.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If, their argument goes on, governments resort to printing money to finance their deficits or, worse still, default, they may cause "havoc" in the markets, with horrid political and social consequences. Even if havoc is avoided, such governments might, by adopting bad policies, force their citizens' savings to be spent on consumption instead of the profitable investment that is newly available in the developing world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many pundits worry that financial markets are undermining governments' power. What worries these soothsayers is that politicians may undermine the inexorably growing power of financial markets. Some readers might sense a contradiction: if the markets are becoming so powerful, how can the policies of governments overwhelm them? The authors' bluff answer is that the economic strength of governments now consists mainly of the Samsonite power to destroy: they will find it increasingly difficult to control exchange rates or domestic interest rates as the global financial market grows in relation to the real economy. But governments, the authors argue, are still able to bring the temple crashing down upon people's heads--a bleak view of the role of politics.

Global Capital Revolution
<p>We have all grown up in a world where the critical economic decisions for nations have been made by a small group of people at the center of each national government. Whether elected by voters or protected in office by the military, these national political elites have played the decision-making roles in setting interest rates and foreign exchange rates and in allocating capital within the nation. The power of these political elites to control the flow of capital within their nations has been directly derived from the historic province of the nation state to regulate, to print money, to tax, to subsidize, and to borrow money largely without constraint.</p>
<p>We are now witnessing the transfer of this power away from these small elite groups to a global capital market that is only now beginning to flex its muscles. Like an awkward adolescent, the global capital market is just now discovering its own strength and potential.</p>
<p>Increasingly, millions of global investors, operating out of their own economic self-interest, are determining interest rates, exchange rates, and the allocation of capital, irrespective of the wishes or political objectives of national political leaders.</p>
<p>We are moving toward a world where the capital markets constrain what governments can do--not the other way around. In this environment, government policy is influenced in real time by whether or not it makes economic sense. Bad policies will carry real penalties, and good policies will be quickly rewarded.</p>
<p>This shift in power has not gone unnoticed by political leaders. James Carville, President Clinton's political advisor, remarked: "I used to think, if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the President or the pope or a .400 baseball hitter. But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everyone."</p>
<p>Not all the political leaders of the world have reacted to this power shift with good humor. Fresh from losing a battle of wills, not to mention billions of dollars, to global market participants, the French finance Minister Michel Sapin said in a 1992 radio interview, "When you are faced with speculation, the only thing to do is to make them pay the price for their speculation. During the (French) Revolution, such people were known as agiteurs (political speculators) and they were beheaded."</p>
<p>We are in the midst of a global capital revolution and revolutions spark strong emotions. Just as the French Revolution led to a fundamental transfer of power and economic transformation, so will the global capital revolution. Is the coming of this revolution good news or bad news? The question remains open.</p>
<p>As the market becomes unbound from the constraints of national governments, it is creating the potential for a tidal wave of global capitalism that could drive rapid growth and highly beneficial integration of the world's real economy well into the next century. There is also a somewhat less probable, but nonetheless significant, chance that the power of this market could turn destructive and unleash financial instability and social turmoil such as the world has not seen since the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
<p>Whether we have the best of times or the worst of times will be determined by the way that national governments react to the growing power of the market. If they embrace the market and use its power in concert with the power of the state, national governments have every opportunity to ensure prosperity for their citizens. If they work in opposition to the market, using it, for example, to fund unsustainable fiscal deficits, they could push beyond the limits of their debt capacity with destructive consequences.</p>
<p>The danger is that we will let petty politics get in the way of pursuing rational policies and addressing serious challenges. Depending on your political viewpoint, the growing power of the global capital market relative to national governments may either be exhilarating or terrifying. Indeed, it is difficult to discuss these issues without becoming deeply entangled in a political discussion. However, it does not matter whether a national government or a political party likes or dislikes the development of such a powerful global market and the loss of direct control of its domestic economy any more than it matters whether a national government likes or dislikes nuclear weapons. The global market, like nuclear weapons, has become a reality that is too big to ignore, and national policy must reflect this reality. </p>

The profit opportunities available today in the global capital markets are so
large, and the capital seeking those opportunities is so vast and so highly
mobile, that we are entering into an entirely new era of capitalism. The process
of globalization has been going on gradually for decades, but the world's capital
markets have now reached critical mass. They are poised to fuse into a single
global capital market, and we are about to enter into an era of explosive growth
as a result.
<p>Market Unbound is the first book to provide a dynamic blueprint of this challenging new global market. Authors Lowell Bryan and Diana Farrell of McKinsey &amp; Company, Inc., explore the enormous effect this revolution will have on governments, corporations, and individual investors. Although the global economy has already undergone major--and irreversible--change, the transformations yet to come promise the most significant economic developments since the Industrial Revolution. In the uncertain future, one thing is clear: the global capital market is increasingly dictating the actions and policies of governments, as opposed to governments dictating the actions and policies of the market.</p>
<p>There is, without question, the promise of great prosperity, as rapid growth takes hold in both the developed and underdeveloped world. However, there is also potential for disaster if economic evolution breeds turmoil and social unrest, as companies--and nations--either succumb or succeed in the new global marketplace.</p>
<p>Based on extensive research conducted by McKinsey &amp; Company, Inc., the world'spremier consulting firm Market Unbound: - Explores and defines the dynamic impact the converging markets will have on every sector of society - Examines how the foreign exchange and bond markets are integrating to the point where they are fundamentally acting as one - Explains how to seek profit and avoid loss in the impending economic climate - Reveals how a government's ability to exercise control over its own financial system is being undermined by the global capital market</p>
<p>As the global capital market continues to mature, those who adapt to new rules will find the opportunity for tremendous gain; those who don't face catastrophic loss. This invaluable book is must reading for every investor, economist, banker, policymaker, and international businessperson. </p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Here is a compelling American tale--a story of greed gone wild. This is the saga of the takeover of the Pacific Lumber Company, and how a small Northern California town was divided against itself; as told by a master storyteller.
</p><p>The fight begins when the Pacific Lumber Company, operated by the Murphy family since 1904 with a strong tradition of both employee care and selective cutting of the last privately held redwood forest in America, is bought out by the huge Texas-based conglomerate Maxxam, Inc. (financed in part by Michael Milken). Eager to cash in on the thousands of acres of valuable lumber, the new owners sharply increase production. When members of the radical environmentalist group Earth First! get involved, strapping themselves to the giant redwoods to halt cutting, the battle becomes explosive. But for all the financial maneuvers, demonstrations, and lawsuits, it's a battle nobody wins.
</p><p>The Last Stand is a story of greed, fanaticism, and devotion that ranges from the paneled boardrooms overlooking Wall Street and Rodeo Drive to the banks of the Eel River, and that races through the mountains hiding the nation's most infamous marijuana-growing industry, and also curves past Pacific Lumber's cavernous mills, source of the great majority of the world's high-grade redwood lumber. By chronicling the takeover of Pacific Lumber, David Harris gives us a metaphor for the disappearance of an arguably more gentle, kinder capitalism-- a capitalism that, in large measure, was responsible for an America now under siege. The Last Stand is a book about how some people, often against their will, end up killing the very thing that had long given them sustenance and shelter-- the forest itself. It is, finally, about what Wall Street does to Main Street and what progress does to the planet.
</p><p>If John Ford were alive, he would make The Last Stand into a thrilling Western, for its every part stands as a metaphor for a war now raging across the country: a battle for the very soul of the nation. David Harris brings his astonishing literary gifts, as well as his own moral passion and keen eye for nuance and human complexity to this riveting and important story. <br>

<h2>Spare that tree</h2><ul><li><a href="4ex96.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> L<font size=-1>AST</font> S<font size=-1>TAND</font></a>&nbsp; By David Harris.<br>
</ul>

<p>LONG before anybody knew how to spell ecology, Pacific Lumber Company was a model forestry and logging firm as well as a model of corporate paternalism. It was also the owner of the last big swathes of old-growth redwood forest in private hands until it fell foul of the greedy takeover culture of the 1980s. Its capture by Charles Hurwitz, a Texan obsessed with cash-flow, signalled the end of an era and the beginning of a struggle.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At stake were the remaining giant redwood trees, <i>sequoia sempervirens</i>, of California's coastal forests. Some of them were more than 1,000 years old; many of them were more than 200 feet (60 metres) high and 15 feet wide. Under the Murphy family, members of which operated the firm from 1904 onwards, these prize assets were treated with deference. For decades Pacific Lumber practised "selective" cutting of its trees rather than the ugly "clear-cutting" technique favoured by so much of the North American industry. And it had a policy of never cutting more timber than its lands' new growth, ensuring that it would always have trees to cut.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To corporate raiders in the 1980s, however, the company was a steal. Its share price under-valued its assets, particularly if new owners could speed up production and raid its rich pension fund. Sure enough, in February 1986 Pacific Lumber was taken over by Maxxam, a conglomerate owned by Mr Hurwitz. Shortly thereafter the company began to cut down trees as fast as its mills could cut them up. Cash-flow, not old growth, was the mantra of the new managers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first half of David Harris's engaging account shows how Pacific Lumber stumbled into losing its independence. Its board was remarkably naive, hiring investment bankers but giving them an incentive to sell the firm for the highest price. It failed to make use of what appeared to be strong defences against takeover.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for Mr Hurwitz, he played a weak hand with great skill. In retrospect his leveraged takeover was a classic of the 1980s. The deal's sponsors were Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert, the pioneers of the junk-bond market. According to Mr Harris, Mr Hurwitz's allies also included Ivan Boesky, an arbitrageur, and Boyd Jeffries, a broker, both of whom subsequently served criminal sentences for various offences.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second half of "The Last Stand" chronicles the takeover's aftermath. Mr Hurwitz's tactics were countered by activist greens in California. They fought physically and in the courts against the predatory behaviour of Pacific Lumber. In so doing, they drew national attention to the plight of the redwoods.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This fine and occasionally sinister tale is ultimately depressing. Greed remains the dominant ethos in the logging industry. Pacific Lumber has been broken into separate entities, and efforts to preserve the old-growth trees as a national park have faltered. Mr Harris's title is apt.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At first, the phone call just brought Warren up short, like one of those cartoon collisions in which the front of the column screeches to a halt and the rest of the parade, helpless to control its momentum, stacks up against the leading edge like the pleats of an accordion--only in this instance, Warren Lawrence Murphy was rear-ended by a hundred years of Humboldt County history and five generations of his own ancestors, piling on as he stood there in the living room of his company house in the company's town, slackjawed and at a loss for words. This was the beginning of the end, but Warren Lawrence Murphy hadn't a clue.
</p><p>The day had been frantic since the 8:oo A.M. whistle blew, but nothing all that extraordinary had happened until now. Warren had hustled down to Mill A a half-dozen times, trying to untangle the new conveyors that refused to work right and then to hassle with the gang saw that kept fouling itself. Mill A had been back on line at full shift for almost a year since the rebuild, but it was still a nest of glitches and slowdowns and each fresh one meant John Campbell's tree stump of a neck would bristle and turn pink and Warren's backside would end up with singe marks all over it. Then, right before the lunch whistle, Maintenance located dry rot down in the kilns and, as if Warren wasn't already stretched like a five-pound line hooked to a fifty-pound fish, Campbell decided he wanted another set of numbers for the product flow around the proposed new power plant and he wanted those numbers yesterday and he didn't care what else his manager of lumber operations had on his plate, he wanted them in a bloody hurry, no excuses.
</p><p>Frayed on all edges, Warren finally signed out of the office and went home about the time the evening fog bank reached Rio Dell on the far side of the Eel. It was just your typical July day until the phone rang.
</p><p>What'd you say? Warren mumbled into the receiver.
</p><p>They want to buy it out, Enright repeated, a little exasperated at how thick Murphy was being. They want to buy the Pacific Lumber Company and they want you to front the deal.
</p><p>Buy PL? Warren repeated the phrase to himself but it still didn't make sense. Buy PL? What could have gotten into those Texans' heads? Pacific Lumber wasn't the kind of company anybody could just walk in and buy. Not since the days of his great-great-grandfather, Simon Jones Murphy, anyway, and Simon had bought the company back when the only links between the county and the rest of the world were the fleet of lumber barques anchored in Humboldt Bay and the rutted wagon track that wound south through the Coast Range and washed out every winter, when the rain fell in sheets and the Eel turned surly. Buy PL? Warren's dad, Stanwood Albert Murphy, God rest his soul, would have gagged at the very notion, and he was the one who'd first listed Pacific Lumber on the New York Stock Exchange, fifteen years ago. "Buy PL?" Stan would have roared over a third martini down at the Scotia Inn. "Someone must be cuttin' your hair with a chain saw. You've lost your goddamn mind." And then he'd have led the bar in laughter, chuckling so hard his chin jiggled.
</p><p>Buy PL?
</p><p>That's right, Warren, buy PL, Enright repeated. You know, make a tender offer for the stock and the whole bit. You forgot what you learned in biz school already?
</p><p>All of that corporate trading curriculum was indeed a dim memory to Warren. These days, almost a decade since his graduate student life at the University of San Diego, his thoughts were consumed with log scales, board feet, skid roads, Timber Harvest Plans, green chains, and head rigs, subjects with which no one at the School of Business concerned themselves. Warren's soft face creased as his mind sought recall. <br>

<p>
</p><p><p>WHY THE EARTH QUAKES</p>
</p><p>We expect anything to move, but not the earth! And we certainly do not expect mountains to throw the earth's innards into the sky! Nothing is as frightening as to feel the earth shake under our feet or to see flaming lava spew from unknown depths, moving mercilessly towards us.
</p><p>The aim of the authors of this book, who have personally experienced such terrifying catastrophes, is to demystify their causes and to explain in layman's terms not only their origins but how, at long last, we may defend ourselves from the powerful assaults of earthquakes and volcanoes.
</p><p>By exploring the miracle of the universe's creation, Why the Earth Quakes leads the reader through a brief, fascinating voyage to the birth and growth of our planet with its cracked and constantly shifting crust.
</p><p>The origins of earthquakes and volcanoes, often called the crucibles of creation, are explained through the stories of the worst natural disasters of all time: Lisbon, 1755, which was ravaged by the destructive force of a tsunami; San Francisco in 1906, whose fires left over 500 dead, 5,000 injured, and 100,000 homeless in its wake; Alaska in 1964, the largest recorded earthquake in North America, which deformed a larger area of the earth's surface than any other quake in history; Vesuvius, which buried the ancient cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79; Krakatau, its huge clouds of ash in 1883 gave the world a true foretaste of a "nuclear winter"; Mount St. Helens, which destroyed an entire mountain and killed 61 people in 1980; and Kobe, which left over 5,000 dead and over 20,000 injured in 1995. These are the names of some of the earth-shaking events that form the background for an exploration of the nature of earthquakes and volcanoes, the prediction of their behavior, and an up-to- date description of the measures we can take, socially and personally, to protect ourselves from their destructive nature.
</p><p>Technical issues needed to understand the behavior of earthquakes and volcanoes such as plate tectonics and seismic gaps are explained in clear and concise terms. Over one hundred illustrations clarify them for both the general reader and the professional. One section of the book is dedicated to answering the most commonly asked questions about how to be ready and avoid the worst consequences of our earth's onslaughts. <br>

<p><b>Earthquakes</b></p>
<h2>Shock tactics</h2><ul><li><a href="4ex71.html">W<font size=-1>HY</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> E<font size=-1>ARTH</font> Q<font size=-1>UAKES</font></a>&nbsp; By Matthys Levy and Mario Salvadori.<br>
</ul>


<p>IN KAMCHATKA, the inhabitants blamed a monstrous dog; in Chile, legend told of two tussling snakes. Buried bulls, elephants, frogs and fish have all had their proponents. Matthys Levy and Mario Salvadori are more hard-headed as they seek to explain why earthquakes happen. They skim through the mythology and press on through the history of the world's greatest quakes to summarise modern seismic theory--and its lessons for architects, engineers and town planners.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those lessons were sharpened last year when the Hanshin earthquake flattened much of Kobe in Japan, killing 5,000 people and leaving 300,000 homeless. Geological mistakes had diverted the attention of seismologists to a region north of Kobe. Civil planners had allowed elevated highways to be supported on poorly reinforced concrete columns. Building codes in Japan and other countries were re-examined after many more buildings in Kobe collapsed than engineers had believed likely, just as they were after the Northridge quake hit southern California a year earlier.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why the Earth Quakes" cites both the Northridge and Kobe disasters in describing how hard it is to prepare for earthquakes--and how important it is to do so. In Northridge a programme (conceived after a 1971 earthquake in San Fernando) was in train to add steel jackets to the columns that support elevated freeways. The columns already strengthened survived almost unharmed in the quake.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To survive earthquakes, structures must be flexible enough to absorb some shaking, though not so rubbery as to wave in the wind and become uncomfortable. Modern construction methods also include springy foundations and hydraulic pumps to isolate buildings from the ground, and so let them float free of terrestrial infirmity. The eight-storey Los Angeles University Hospital had a bed of lead-and-rubber buffers which absorbed most of the motion of the Northridge quake, and it was the only emergency hospital able to run properly immediately afterwards.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Levy, an architectural engineer, and Mr Salvadori, a professor of civil engineering, explain well how these things are done. But theirs is not a textbook. It provides simple accounts of the basic principles of seismically sound construction, supported by large, clear diagrams.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same approach--short, simple chapters and plenty of illustration--is used to explain the geological causes of earthquakes. Plate tectonics is polished off, volcanoes enthusiastically explored, <i>tsunamis </i>(tidal waves) described. The authors even provide a 12-page cosmology to explain the fiery mantle on which the tectonic plates float and grind against each other.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As an introduction to the wide range of earthquake lore, the book works. Readers comfortably settled far from seismic danger will find the authors' enthusiasm enjoyable; those whose ten-storey brick homes lie closer to faults will hope that an enjoyable book never becomes useful.

</p><ul><font size=-1>Thou unconcern'd canst hear the mighty crack: <br> Pit, box, and gall'ry in convulsion hurl'd, <br> Thou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting  world. <br> --ALEXANDER POPE</font></ul>
<p>Mother Earth
</p><p>The earth, when formed about five billion years ago, consisted mainly of very hot gases that, over time, cooled and became denser. As far as we know, the earth is the only grain of matter in the cosmos that has an atmosphere conducive to life and, when unpolluted, is a joy to breathe.
</p><p>If we could cut the earth in half like an apple (Fig. 1.1), we would notice its inner spherical core of solid nickel and iron (20 percent of the earth's radius), surrounded by a layer of molten nickel and iron (35 percent of the earth's radius). Around the earth's metallic center lies the mantle (45 percent of the earth's radius) of melted rock with a viscous, molasses-like but dense and fairly rigid inner layer, the asthenosphere, a more plastic layer, and the lithosphere, the hard outermost layer 100 km (62 mi.) thick. The topmost outer layer of the lithosphere is the crust, on an average 30 km (19 mi.) thick under the continents and only 5 km (3 mi.) thick under the oceans. (The boundary between the crust and the mantle, the Moho discontinuity, is named after the Yugoslav seismologist Andrija Mohorovicic, who first discovered it by studying the path of seismic waves [see p. 68]). <br>

<p><b>Human welfare</b></p>
<h2>Never better</h2><ul><li>T<font size=-1>HE</font> S<font size=-1>TATE</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> H<font size=-1>UMANITY</font></a>&nbsp; Edited by Julian Simon.<br>
</ul>


<p>RELAX. You might think everything is getting worse. In fact, almost everything--the environment, health, living conditions--has been getting steadily better since records began, and will probably continue to do so. That is the thesis of "The State of Humanity".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Julian Simon, an American academic who has a reputation for annoying the greens, has written the introduction and conclusion. His opinions sandwich 56 chapters, each penned by a different expert, most of whom rely on statistics rather than mere opinion to make their point.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of the improvements in human welfare should lighten the mood of the most glum. For many millennia, life expectancy at birth hovered around the mid-20s. Over the past few centuries it has increased to over 70 years in many parts of the world. Much of this rise is due to the defeat of smallpox, typhus, scarlet fever, bubonic plague and other deadly diseases. Medical knowledge, sewerage, better nutrition--such advances have made people healthier than ever before. Those who worry about today's rapid rate of population growth often forget that it has been driven by a wonderful trend: a big fall in the death rate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other cheerful trends include the spread of education (since the 1960s the proportion of children enrolled in school has risen, in rich and poor countries alike), durable economic growth in most parts of the world and an increase in food production in line with population growth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The book's weakness is not the quality of its analysis. Sufficient evidence is usually cited to demonstrate the benign nature of this or that trend. Its flaw lies instead in the selection of trends. One chapter, for example, concentrates on the standard of living of black Americans, showing that it has improved dramatically over the past century or so. This misses the point: inequality. Black Americans still lag behind whites in many ways: they earn less, suffer higher rates of unemployment and live shorter lives. Similarly, in pointing to better standards of health and welfare in poor countries these smug experts obscure the huge gap between the rich and poor worlds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They are also almost exclusively concerned with long-run trends, even when these mask short-run catastrophes. In his conclusion, Mr Simon verges on bad taste when he points out that the Black Death interrupted economic progress and population growth merely for a century or so. He is right to argue that people are too ready to believe doomsayers, but fails to recognise that gloom has its uses. Dire warnings have averted disasters. Food productivity rose in the 1970s partly because fear of famine spurred governments to subsidise agricultural research. Similarly, fear of global warming is now encouraging research into ways of reducing the cost of clean fuels. If human progress is inevitable, that may be because humans are always worrying about what might go wrong.

<p><b>Biography</p></b>
PAUL HEMPHILL is the author of nine previous books including Long Gone
and The Nashville Sound. Despite his success as a journalist and author,
Hemphill still rankles over his release forty years ago by the woeful Graceville
Oilers of the Class D Alabama-Florida League on a morning after he had struck
out all four times he came to bat. "It was politics," he says.

<p> By Paul Hemphill. <br>

<a href="9bt286.html">Biography</a>
<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
In early April 1993, Paul Hemphill hopped in his car, drove right past Atlanta-
Fulton County Stadium--home of the major-league Atlanta Braves--and
continued south, ninety miles down I-75, to attend the home opener of the
Macon Braves, a Class A affiliate of the Atlanta Braves franchise. It's not that
he had grown tired of baseball; he was just weary of the bickering and excesses
of the major league game. By attending the home opener of the minor-league
Macon Braves, Hemphill was looking for the heart of the game.
<p>For every spoiled and selfish major-league ballplayer who sneers at the fans and neglects the details of his craft, there are dozens of eager, earnest, hard- working kids toiling in the minors, dreaming of the moment they will someday "crack the show." Down in the minor leagues, uncorrupted by money and greed, the game is played by kids just out of high school or college; kids still learning how to live on their own, struggling to get by on meager salaries, and learning through the endless daily repetition of drills, practice, and the games themselves--what being a professional baseball player is all about.</p>
<p>One such kid is Marty Malloy, a 5' 10", 160-pound, scrappy second baseman working his way through the Braves' farm system. Hardworking, resilient, and gritty, Marty Malloy is a throwback to a time when the game was played with love and desire, when the only kind of strike the players knew was the one that blind umpire called against them the night before. Not blessed with overwhelming physical abilities, but burning with the desire to learn, Marty is the physical embodiment of every boy's dream of playing professional ball.</p>
<p>In The Heart of the Game, Paul Hemphill takes us through Marty's 1994 minor- league season with the Class A Durham Bulls--the same season that was abruptly called to a halt at the major-league level. We see Marty's daily struggles as he attempts to make his way through the Braves' system: his trouble hitting lefthanded pitching, his need to master the double-play pivot, his difficulty coping with life on the road, and his struggle to make ends meet on his $1,100 a month salary. By watching Marty overcome these hardships and merit a promotion to the next level, we learn about the love, the desire, the hard work and the effort that go into the making of every ballplayer, superstar or not.</p>
<p>With charm, grace, and style, Paul Hemphill tells this story like no one else can. Once a second baseman himself, Hemphill enjoyed a very brief career in the minor leagues. Now, we ride with him as he follows Marty's fledgling baseball career through all of its ups and downs. To watch Marty Malloy drop a bunt down the third base line, or elude the flashing spikes of a runner hoping to break up a doubleplay, or recklessly chase a foul ball into the brick wall that surrounds the field, is to remember what we first loved about the game of baseball, and to realize that while big stars come and go, it's the prospect who represents the heart and soul of the game itself. In a book that lilts with the sultry rhythms of a baseball summer, Paul Hemphill brilliantly chronicles the education of a minor league ballplayer--and through him, of all who play the game. </p>

<p>"BULL DURHAM" marked a turning point--not so much in the history of baseball as in the history of baseball nostalgia. Most earlier baseball films had treated the sport reverently. On-screen players faced adversity and indulged occasionally in disreputable behaviour, but Hollywood's overall view of baseball differed little from baseball's view of itself--that is, as a sport that ranks as dear to Americans as dad and pumpkin pie.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Bull Durham" was different. With one brief but memorable exchange the film sliced through the sap encrusting the sport's image. A young batboy hands a wizened veteran, Crash Davis (Kevin Costner), a bat with a heartfelt, "Get a hit!"--the kind of exhortation familiar to anybody who has ever seen a baseball movie. In this version, though, Crash tells the kid to "Shut up!" Utterly unexpected, these words check nostalgia with reality.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thankfully, several recent baseball books have managed to carry on the flame lit in 1988 by "Bull Durham": portraying baseball's sins with enough sensitivity and intelligence to heighten, rather than obscure, the sport's innate charms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inspired but imperfect, one of these, "The Heart of the Game: The Education of a Minor-League Ballplayer", is written by Paul Hemphill whose short-lived drive for baseball fame laid the groundwork for a novel, "Long Gone", about a fictional 1950s team called the Tampico Stogies. (A year before "Bull Durham", "Long Gone" was made into a film that was all but overlooked at the time.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Hemphill decided to write "The Heart of the Game" as a reaction to the sport's labour-management strife and the arrogance of its players (he had watched an autograph-seeking youngster get stiffed by a millionaire outfielder). Searching for solace in the minor leagues, Mr Hemphill stumbled upon Marty Malloy, a second-baseman who reminded him of himself as a young man. Mr Hemphill decided to spend a season hanging around Mr Malloy and his teammates on (appropriately enough) the real-life Durham Bulls.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The story line is promising: how does a baseball-obsessed youngster not only manage to climb the sport's treacherous career ladder but also learn to live on his own, far from his close-knit family? Mr Hemphill carries it off with mixed success.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He paints a convincing portrait of Mr Malloy's isolated upbringing in Trenton, Florida, and his family's devotion to his career. He also airs serious issues--Marty's out-of-wedlock child and the probable racism of his father--without upsetting the baseball-driven story. And he shows, briefly but successfully, how wise old baseball men serve as surrogate fathers to rookies--until they have to fire most of them for not being good enough ballplayers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, Mr Hemphill's reach exceeds his grasp. Having chosen Mr Malloy as his subject, he is stuck with him, and although Mr Malloy may be an Everyman, he is not a compelling one. Mr Hemphill surely must have understood this: he quotes him directly only a half-dozen times, and not for more than a sentence or two. Marty Malloy would be the first to admit that he is no intellectual, and that is hardly a sin. But the reader expects a little more self-awareness in a 288-page exposition of somebody's life.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike Mr Malloy, Dan Shaughnessy's Boston Red Sox, in "At Fenway", often fall victim to over-intellectualisation. Although their record is not nearly as poor as that of some of their rivals, they inspire unparalleled fatalism among their supporters (perhaps a reflection of the region's puritanical heritage). Ivy-league professors regularly appear on television to wax philosophical about Boston's cursed Red Sox, who have not won the World Series since 1912, the year their fabled Fenway Park was built.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fortunately, Mr Shaughnessy, a columnist with the <i>Boston Globe</i>, has covered the team for long enough to have acquired a sceptical as well as a loving eye. He good-naturedly pokes fun at the antics of the "Red Sox Nation", and tells his readers to adore not only the majesty of Fenway's "Green Monster" left-field wall but also the advertisement that predated the wall's famed coat of green paint. "The Red Sox Use Lifebuoy Soap," the ad read; Mr Shaughnessy reports that fans used to snicker, "The Red Sox use Lifebuoy, but they still stink."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Best of all is Mr Shaughnessy's story-telling, about everyone from maniacal statisticians to doomed ballplayers to over-eager partisans. Consider Monte Dutton, a Red Sox fan who named a lamb on his farm in South Carolina "Fenway". After watching a Red Sox first-baseman, Bill Buckner, let a crucial ball go through his legs during the 1986 World Series--an event that soon came to embody the team's jinxed nature--Mr Dutton discovered that Fenway had died during the game. "The Silence of the Lamb," Mr Shaughnessy deadpans. Baseball fans are certainly the richer for this weird and whimsical collection.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Probably the only rivals to the Red Sox in the pantheon of lovable baseball losers are the Chicago Cubs of Wrigley Field. Peter Golenbock, an established baseball chronicler, has produced an encyclopedic, 74-chapter history of the team since the 1876 World Series. It will put Cubs fans in nirvana, but strike anyone else as virtually unreadable. The pages are so densely packed that the best that can be said for the book is that some enterprising writer might one day use it as the basis for a Shaughnessy-style "At Wrigley".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Larry Moffi's "This Side of Cooperstown" manages to escape Mr Golenbock's trap, in part because its reach is much more modest. Designed as a history of baseball in the 1950s, it features interviews with 17 retired players who exhibited modest skills on the field. Mr Moffi presents their reminiscences almost unfiltered, an approach that does not allow for much authorial analysis. Yet this low-intensity narrative serves well, providing players with the opportunity to ramble on, something that usually turns out to be a pleasure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even more pleasurable than hearing the jabber of old-timers is a chance to look at their photographs. "The Game That Was" provides that pleasure in spades. Snapped over several decades by George Burke and George Brace of Chicago, these 376 images languished in Mr Brace's filing cabinets until two Chicago newspaper editors convinced him to co-operate on a book.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Its design and text are marvels of intelligence, taste and restraint. The reproductions are crisp, the layout is austere and the captions find precisely the right words--and not one more--to encapsulate each image's significance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Particularly poignant are the thematic sections. Early Wynn earns a place in the book's "tough guy" grouping for replying, when asked if he would throw at his own mother, "It would depend on how well she was hitting." Dale "Moose" Alexander qualifies as a "tough loss" not merely for injuring his knee while sliding home but for being burned by a trainer who mishandled the electric equipment he used to treat the player. Mr Alexander, who got gangrene and almost lost his leg, recalls matter-of-factly: "I was finished in the majors." The authors assign Sig Jakucki to the "notorious" bunch for his response to a request from a one-armed teammate, Pete Gray, for assistance: "Tie your own goddamned shoes, you one-armed son of a bitch." Even Crash Davis might have winced at that.

Throughout the fall of '93 and what passes for winter in his neck of the Florida
outback, the kid began most days by driving his pickup truck to a construction
site thirty miles away in Gainesville, the big city in those parts, where he stood
around in the predawn hour sipping coffee from a paper cup and warming
himself over a bonfire of lumber scraps, in the company of men with names
like Cotton and Spiderman and Curly, while they all waited for sunrise and the
foreman. For those other men, poorly educated laborers whose years were
measured by a time clock, this was as good as life promised to get. They would
needle him from time to time about his ballplaying, about how he would
probably get so rich one day that he would up and buy his own construction
business just so he could boss them around but for the most part they spoke of
joists and drywall and plumbing and women. He enjoyed the camaraderie and
would laugh with them as they spun their tales of other jobs and other towns,
and all in all he liked the work because it paid $8 an hour and it kept him in
shape and it didn't take much thinking to pour concrete. It could be better--as it
was for the players who had gotten bonuses so large that they didn't have to
work at all in the offseason--and it could be worse. He shivered to think of
working on the floor of a sporting goods store, as his best buddy in baseball had
done one winter, because, to tell the truth, he didn't much like crowds unless
they were in a grandstand, cheering as he flew around the bases.

Ours is an age obsessed by personal relationships. From cradlee to grave we
have a need to bond, or so we are told by psychiatrists and agony aunts who go
on to insist that our capacity to form and retain attachments is a basic criterion
of psychological health.When we discuss solitude, it tends to be in the context
of 'the problem of loneliness'.
<p>Yet in previous ages the capacity to seek fulfilment outside society has been admired and seen as a measure of discernment and inner security. Hermits build up great reputations, not only for asceticism and spirituality but for their insight into the human condition.</p>
<p>In this lucid and highly readable book, Peter France shows that these men and women still have something vitally important to say to a society that fears solitude. Tracing the history of hermits, from the Taoists and Ancient Greek up to the present day, he provides fascinating accounts of the lives of some of those who have chosen to live apart, and the knowledge derived from their lives of contemplation: Diogenes and the Desert Fathers; the Russian startsy, Henry David Thoreau, Ramakrishna, Charles de Foucauld,Thomas Merton, and the American poet Robert Lax, a modern hermit who lives on an island in the Aegean.These accounts are interwoven and illuminated by extracts from the writings of hermits, from Thoreau's Walden journals to Thomas Merton's moving reflections on the fruits of solitary meditation.</p>
<p>Gracefully written, accessible and witty, Hermits opens out profound issues: the wisdom that emerges from solitude, and the constant human need, which has surfaced in all ages and all societies, to spend time alone. </p>

<p><b>Biography</p></b>
Peter France spent the first fifteen years of his working life as a civil servant in
the Fiji Islands. After a spell as an academic, he joined the BBC, first in radio
where he launched and presented Kaleidoscope, and later in television, where
he wrote and presented programmes such as Everyman and Timewatch. His
most recent books are The Rape of Egypt and Greek as a Treat. He lives in
Devon but spends much of his time on the Greek Island of Patmos.

<p>IN FEBRUARY 1965 a refrigerator was delivered to Thomas Merton's hermitage. It bothered him: after all, he had spent many years hoping that his monastic superiors would allow him to live alone, and it did not seem right that a hermit should use a fridge. The apparently frivolous issue of how many domestic appliances a hermit needs prompted, says Peter France, one of Merton's most important insights into the solitary life, namely that it can be judged only by the inner experience, not by the external surroundings. Trappings have little to do with Trappists.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In his elegant, witty and instructive book, Mr France describes the importance of a solitary life by means of a study of some of those who have best lived it. He does not pretend to have written a full, historical survey of hermits--deliberately, he includes nothing at all about the great western medieval mystics. Instead, he leads his reader round his personal mentors, in a vast circle that begins, and ends, with the Taoist ideals of the fifth century <font size=-1>BC</font> for which Merton developed an enthusiasm. According to the Tao, something superior to society is waiting to be discovered in solitude. It is a dream as old as humanity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There have been many who lived holy, lonely lives of whom virtually nothing is known and little can be said. But an odd element in the whole adventure is that, often, men who choose to cast themselves out of society are sought after by the rest of humanity for advice on how best to live within it. The classic example is St Antony the Great, who in search of seclusion pressed ever further into the Egyptian desert only to emerge after 20 years to share his wisdom with a hungry world. Such men speak little of their own asceticism or even of their spiritual experiences. Their demeanour is their lesson. Mr France uses the touching words of a great scholar, Helen Waddell, to describe the impression left by the desert fathers: "It was their humility, their gentleness, their heart-breaking courtesy that was the seal of their sanctity to their contemporaries, far beyond abstinence, or miracle, or sign."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One early hero was Crates, a pupil of Diogenes. He sold all his lands and left his money deposited in a bank, with the instructions that, if his sons grew up to become ordinary, ignorant people, they would inherit it; if, on the other hand, they blossomed into philosophers, his money was to be given to the poor. Though not exactly a hermit, Crates seemed to have had the right--or at least an interesting--idea.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles de Foucauld made the decision for himself, a hundred years ago. He was a great character. By the time he was 20 he was immensely rich, fat and self-indulgent, preferring to step into a low-slung carriage after a good dinner so as not to have to make too much effort lifting his foot. Yet his conversion experience was so powerful that by the end of his life he was a poor, zealous missionary to the Tuaregs, a latter-day desert father whose rule is still followed by the Little Brothers of Christ.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rich were, of course, not ever thus. In the 18th century, there seemed no need to do something yourself if you could pay someone else to do it for you. In an enjoyable interlude, Mr France wanders into the terrain of the ornamental hermit, employed to wear a long beard and hold an hour-glass as part of the garden furniture of a large estate. He even provides suggestions from a textbook for suitable abodes for such employees, ranging from the humble, mossy hut to the full, top-of-the-range, six-roomed, shell-lined Gothick grotto. An early flowering of political correctness put paid to such mutually lucrative ventures, and the hermit was replaced by a disappointing dummy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it would be unfair to leave this book on that note. After the Greek philosophers, the monks of Mount Athos and the <i>startsy</i> of Russia, it is best to return to Thomas Merton. "The hermit", he wrote, "has a very real place in a world like ours that has degraded the human person and lost all respect for that awesome loneliness in which each single spirit must confront the living God." Not everyone would put it that way. But Merton's reflections on solitude will stir many readers, just as they have obviously moved Mr France.

CHAPTER ONE
<p>The Emergence of the Individual</p>
<p>The Greeks, who first taught the Western world what could be achieved by living together, were also the first people in that world to work out a philosophical justification for living alone. Greek society in the age of Pericles reached unsurpassed levels of achievement in philosophy and the arts, and even gave birth to science; but that same age, which was called 'golden' because of the glories created by the city-state, was also the first to discover the significance of the individual. Although the Greeks never developed a hermit culture, they were the first to work out a philosophy of solitariness - one which stressed the value of the individual outside a social context. So, as they are the founders of our civilisation, they are also the inspiration of those who have chosen to live outside it.</p>
<p>The world of classical Greece which gave birth to European civilisation was not a place in which to be solitary. Man, said one of the most influential of all Greeks, Aristotle, is a political animal. By this phrase, echoed by political philosophers down the centuries, he did not mean that we are all born to take an active interest in party politics but that it is in our nature to live in a polis, or community. Human beings, Aristotle taught, achieve their full potential by working for the common good, and their drive to do so is not implanted by society through an education in Civics but iS an innate instinct.</p>
<p>An ancient Greek myth explains this. When the gods were first creating the animal kingdom, they gave to the brothers Prometheus and Epimetheus the power to choose the characteristics of each member as it was created. Epimetheus, who had more zeal than intelligence, persuaded Prometheus to let him do it by himself and he began distributing the gifts of the gods with enthusiasm. To some animals he gave horns and claws so that they could hunt for their food; to others he gave fleetness of foot to run away. To the different creatures as they came into being he handed out great strength, keen senses, thick skins and furs to ward off the cold. The last animal to be created was Man. By this time, Epithemius had nothing left to give. So Man was put on earth a bare, forked, unprotected thing until Prometheus, taking pity on humans, stole fire from heaven and gave them technology.</p>
<p>But technology demands communal effort, and humans could not use it to survive unless they could learn to cooperate and live in communities. So Zeus sent Hermes with two gifts from his own personal store: a sense of shame and a sense of justice. Hermes asked if he should distribute these gifts only to some individuals and not to others - like the practical skills of carpentry and housebuilding. But Zeus said no: a community cannot survive only through its experts. If it contains laymen in the arts of communal living as there are laymen in the practical skills it will fail. So all men were given a sense of shame and justice. 'And' Zeus added, 'implant this custom in them from me: that if there should be one without a sense of justice or shame from doing wrong he should be put to death as a pest of the community.' So the arete of Man, the purpose for which he was created, his true virtue, is to live in communities. Man is, by nature, a political animal. </p>

 By Paul Krugman. <br>
<i> Press; 240 pages; $22.50 and &#163;14.95</i><br>


<p>ECONOMISTS are widely, and often accurately, accused of being unable to write. These top American academics are refreshing exceptions. Both have produced sets of essays written for non-economists; their pieces combine sophisticated economic reasoning with simple, lucid and even humorous prose.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Getting it Right" is based on articles written by Robert Barro for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> since 1991. It ranges from a discussion of the impact of democracy on economic growth to the economics of regulating smoking and of term limits for incumbent politicians. The unifying theme is provided by Mr Barro's classically liberal outlook (which emphasises the importance of property rights, free markets and minimal government intervention) and by rigorous analysis.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether the subject is monetary policy in Latin America, tax rises under the Clinton administration or the merits of regulation to save endangered species, these essays apply basic premises of economic reasoning (eg, that people behave rationally, that markets are the most efficient way to allocate resources) to reach logically impeccable conclusions. Many of the essays--including the one that advances powerful arguments in favour of index-linked bonds as a way for governments to borrow--are currently topical.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Paul Krugman's offering is more breezy in style, more provocative in tone and more narrow in scope. His aim is to undermine "pop internationalism"--a term he coined for the (mistaken) conventional wisdom that he feels has replaced serious discussion of world trade. This takes several forms. It includes the common misconceptions that countries are locked in an economic battle with each other and that third-world growth threatens rich countries. Its hallmarks, according to Mr Krugman, are the use of glib assertion, the misuse of statistics and a failure to understand basic trade theory.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Krugman's crusade against "pop internationalists" is both warranted and well-executed. Much popular discussion of international trade is economically illiterate. He is right to point out, for instance, that the oft-used analogy of a country "competing" in the global market in the same way that a firm "competes" is nonsense. A country whose productivity increases more slowly than others will grow more slowly (and become relatively poorer). It will not go out of business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Several of the articles reproduced in the book caused a stir when they were first published and still merit attention now. One is a prescient speech Mr Krugman gave in Mexico city in 1993 predicting the devaluation of the peso. Each is worth reading. But you can have too much of a good thing. Taken as a whole, it must be said, this collection is repetitious, and Mr Krugman's arrogant tone eventually begins to grate.

 By Sir Alec Cairncross.<br>
<i> Macmillan</i>; <i>275 pages; &#163;45</i><br>

<p>SIR ALEC CAIRNCROSS was at the heart of British economic policymaking throughout the 1960s, first as economic adviser to the British government between 1961 and 1964 and then as head of the Government Economic Service from 1964 to 1969. So at one level this is a fascinating, and highly personal, account of Britain's decade of "stop and go" economic policies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a deftly woven tale of successive chancellors (first Conservative, then Labour) who were united in their emphasis on economic growth, their belief that demand management was the best way to achieve it, and their failure to deal with balance-of-payments problems until it was too late. With clarity and candour, Sir Alec charts Britain's lurches from one foreign-exchange crisis to the next, the eventual devaluation of the pound by the Treasury under James Callaghan in 1967, and the struggle to avoid a second devaluation thereafter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beyond its historical merit, the book provides a telling indictment of the mechanisms and pretensions of government activism. Policymakers were fond of economic planning in the 1960s. The National Economic Development Council was created in Britain, and national plans drawn up and annual targets set for economic growth, with scant regard paid to how they were to be achieved. Incomes policies were introduced to restrain wage inflation. Micromanagement of the business cycle through taxes and government spending was the norm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two now conventional tenets of modern economic policymaking--the role of monetary policy in controlling inflation and of "supply-side" reforms in promoting higher productivity and growth--were then virtually ignored. For those who find the current orthodoxy uninspiring, Sir Alec's recollections are a valuable reminder of the awfulness of some of the alternatives.

 By Harold James. <br>
<i> OUP;</i><i> 620 pages; &#163;30 and $45</i><br>

<p>COMMISSIONED by the <font size=-1>IMF</font> from an independent scholar for its 50th birthday celebrations, this could have been one more worthy official history. Fortunately, it achieves much more. Skip the dull bits on <font size=-1>IMF</font> minutiae and you have a thought-provoking survey of the post-war world economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Harold James describes the construction of the "Bretton Woods system" (so named because the conference in July 1944 at which the basic structure of the <font size=-1>IMF</font> and World Bank were agreed on was held at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire). Unsurprisingly, much of the emphasis is on monetary co-operation: the gradual establishment of currency convertibility in Europe beginning in the late 1950s; the growing tensions of the "Bretton Woods" fixed-exchange-rate regime in the 1960s; its collapse in the early 1970s and the attempts to manage a "non-system" of floating exchange rates since. But Mr James ranges far beyond exchange rates. The often-acrimonious relations between poor countries and the "international system", the impact of the oil shocks of the 1970s, the debt crisis and the collapse of the Soviet block are all assessed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three broad themes underlie the narrative: relations between monetary issues and broader changes in global trade and output; the extent to which global economic developments can be frustrated by the policies of individual governments; and how far international institutions such as the <font size=-1>IMF</font> can try to mitigate this.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like the best histories, this one delights with unexpected detail: for instance, the tale gleaned from the Russian archives of why the Soviet Union declined to join the <font size=-1>IMF</font> in 1945. Surprisingly, and unlike many other books on the world monetary system, it is a lively and enjoyable read.

<p><b>American presidential power</b></p>
<h2>Uses and abuses</h2><ul> <li>S<font size=-1>ECRET AND </font>S<font size=-1>ANCTIONED</a>: </font>C<font size=-1>OVERT</font> O<font size=-1>PERATIONS</font> <font size=-1>AND</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> A<font size=-1>MERICAN</font> P<font size=-1>RESIDENCY</font>.&nbsp;  By Stephen Knott.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Oxford; 258 pages; $27.50</i> <br>
</ul>

<p>DURING the American Revolution, General George Washington authorised an attempt to kidnap the third son of King George III, the future King William IV. When the British burnt the White House and the Capitol, ex-President Thomas Jefferson suggested that the United States retaliate by hiring impoverished Londoners to burn St Paul's.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stephen Knott strings together similar incidents, most of more moment. His coverage of the war for independence and the first century of the United States is far fuller than his sketchy treatment of more recent events. There is no mention, for instance, of Theodore Roosevelt's success in encouraging and supporting the rebellion and separation of Panama from Colombia in order to obtain territory for an inter-oceanic canal. Yet this is arguably the most successful and the best-known covert action in American history. Also omitted is a fiasco: President Kennedy's Bay of Pigs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The study is devoid of humour or any sense of the dramatic. Mr Knott takes intrinsically interesting material and makes it dull. For example, he explores George Washington's wartime activities as his own highly effective spymaster yet misses the chance to quote from the general's most extraordinary letter. In it Washington, writing to one of his agents, says he believes that he is supposed to sign off with a fictitious name but has "forgotten the name and must be reminded of it again."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Knott's avowed aim is to demonstrate that from Harry Truman to George Bush, American presidents conducted their clandestine foreign policy in a manner that remained faithful to the practices and beliefs of their revered predecessors. He is combating what he regards as the myth that covert operations are a cold-war phenomenon. His approach is to examine actions which were considered permissible by the early presidents and their secretaries of state and compare them with operations recently under attack.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the more remarkable episodes occurred in the 1840s. President John Tyler and his secretary of state, Daniel Webster, used the contingency fund, created for secret foreign operations, to influence opinion leaders in Maine to accept a treaty settling the disputed boundary between Maine and Canada. A big part of the money for this domestic effort was provided, with the administration's consent, by the British government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Knott correctly acknowledges that this episode was one of the most blatant abuses of presidential covert power in American history. But he does not appreciate that his own judgment demonstrates the flaw in his approach. The simple fact that a president has created a precedent does not infallibly make it lawful or wise for his successors to follow it. The Sedition Act of 1798, which made publishing criticism of the government criminal, violates modern concepts of democracy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Secret and Sanctioned" provides a useful, if less than totally reliable, episodic account of many little-known events in American foreign policy. But its author's premise that he is rebutting a serious attack on the future of covert activities fails to recognise that, even after the implosion of the Soviet Empire, there is no serious opposition to the United States maintaining the capability to do mischief--a capability that great powers have always possessed.

<h2>Zinc futures</h2><ul> <li>T<font size=-1>HE</font> W<font size=-1>ORLD</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> P<font size=-1>ARIS</font> C<font size=-1>AFE</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By W. Scott Haine.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Johns Hopkins Univ</i>er<i>sity Press; 368 pages; &#163;33 and $39.95</i> <br>
</ul>

<p>NATHALIE SARRAUTE, a diva of the post-war French novel, flew into a paddy not long ago when an incautious fellow customer, noticing her writing at her table, asked why she chose to compose her works in a caf&eacute;. It was, she raged, the first time she had been interrupted in 40 years, each morning of which she had spent writing at that same table.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms Sarraute notwithstanding, it has to be wondered how much fiction is written in Paris caf&eacute;s these days by anyone, known or unknown. Whether because there are fewer writers to spot or simply because they are becoming less fun, Paris caf&eacute;s, it seems, are in decline. The news from the terraces is that their number has fallen by half since 1980 to a mere 10,000 today. That compares with 42,000 Paris caf&eacute;s in the last half of the 19th century. From 1789 onwards, caf&eacute;s were a theatre of revolutionary talk, as a regular, Karl Marx, gratefully observed. Balzac dubbed caf&eacute;s "the parliament of the people". Napoleon III posted police spies in all the caf&eacute;s of his capital to monitor dangerous talk.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Caf&eacute;s evidently are no more places of fun to Scott Haine than they are to Ms Sarraute. His academic study of their place in French social history is worthwhile and in places even interesting, though never likely to return zip to caf&eacute; life. You learn, for example, that the early opening hours of Paris caf&eacute;s started last century when the average Parisian working man was at <i>"le zinc"</i> by six in the morning for a ritual <i>petit blanc </i>and shot of cognac; also that the zinc-topped bar was introduced in the 1820s and instantly became a popular place for big-city backchat--it still is, though made of cheaper stuff.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By ending with the 19th century, this book leaves out many of the best-known caf&eacute;s: the Flore and Deux Magots at St-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s, the Caf&eacute; de la Paix at the Op&eacute;ra, the Select and the Closerie des Lilas in Montparnasse. The one familiar establishment discernible here is the Procope, an oldie in the Latin Quarter. Today's favourites are 20th-century upstarts.

<p><b>Lyndon Johnson</b></p>
<h2>Resurrected</h2><ul><li>G<font size=-1>UNS</font> <font size=-1>OR</font> B<font size=-1>UTTER</font></a>&nbsp; By Irving Bernstein.<br>
</ul>

<p>LYNDON JOHNSON'S domestic achievements are overshadowed by his conduct of the Vietnam war. Even well-informed pundits tend to leave him out when they talk about activist government. They refer to the tradition of Woodrow Wilson, Harry Truman and the two Roosevelts. At recent Democratic conventions, there have been rows over whether to mention Johnson's name.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Irving Bernstein seeks to redress the neglect of Johnson's legislative successes at home where, with typical crudeness, the president told his subordinates: "You got to learn to mount Congress like you mount a woman." He concentrates on 17 significant statutes and analyses their origins, their contents and the often complex political manoeuvring that Johnson used to secure their enactment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Bernstein is surely right when he concludes that only <font size=-1>FDR</font> matched <font size=-1>LBJ</font> in legislative effectiveness. Roosevelt's programme was a response to the Great Depression. Despair was in the air. The existing system had failed. Change was obviously required. Johnson acted without the stimulus of necessity--the economy was surging; the nation confident. Such efforts as his "War on Poverty" were motivated by his belief that government now had the knowledge to cure old problems and the obligation to do so. Optimism and hubris led to the great domestic programmes, as well as to Vietnam.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the home front, the United States at last provided medical care for its old and poor. Many blacks were enabled to vote for the first time. Women and racial minorities were protected against discrimination. Immigration was cleansed of its bias in favour of northern Europeans. The federal government started to tackle pollution and urban slums. It also sought to improve education at all levels. Improbably, Johnson, a philistine, did more for the arts than any other president: the Kennedy Centre in Washington, the National Endowment for the Arts and commercial-free public radio and television networks are among his legacies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Bernstein's examination of <font size=-1>LBJ</font>'s legislative programme is masterly. The errors and omissions come when he turns to foreign affairs. He is under the impression that Johnson and a small group of advisers chose to wage war in Vietnam in the face of informed and popular opinion. In fact, both the political establishment and the American public initially supported American intervention in Vietnam. Mr Bernstein wrongly asserts that David Halberstam and other influential newsmen stationed in Vietnam in 1963 were doves. They were believers in the war; they disagreed with the way it was being fought.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Bernstein treats well one of the most critical and least remembered episodes of Johnson's presidency. Days before the 1968 American presidential election, <font size=-1>LBJ</font> stopped the bombing of Vietnam in the expectation that negotiations would soon begin among the Americans, the North Vietnamese, the South Vietnamese and the Vietcong. Public opinion polls were showing that Hubert Humphrey, the Democrat candidate, was closing on Richard Nixon, the Republican candidate. Intelligence sources revealed that, through intermediaries, Nixon was advising the South Vietnamese not to enter into negotiations. Johnson passed the information to Humphrey, who declined to make it public. Had Humphrey been less fastidious he might well have won the tight election.

<head>English history<h2>Prodigious</h2><ul> <li><a href="8ex230.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> Y<font size=-1>OUNGER</font> P<font size=-1>ITT</font></a>: T<font size=-1>HE</font> C<font size=-1>ONSUMING</font> S<font size=-1>TRUGGLE</font>.&nbsp;  By John Ehrman. <br>
</ul>

<p>THE younger William Pitt was, by any standards, a prodigy. Elected to parliament at the age of 21, he was chancellor of the exchequer at 22 and prime minister by the time he was 24. Apart from a short break in the early 1800s, he remained in Downing Street until his death at the age of 46 in 1806, shortly after hearing of Napoleon's victory at Austerlitz and 25 years to the day since he first took his seat in the House of Commons. He had spent almost the whole of his adult life in his country's highest office.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The shock of Pitt's sudden death was tremendous, as though Winston Churchill had died following Dunkirk. Where there had been a mighty object, there was suddenly a void. When the speaker announced a motion in the Commons proposing that a memorial be erected, "The silence was death-like, and several of the hardiest oppositionists said it was like an electrical shock upon the House, and that they could hardly breathe." Walter Scott--not yet Sir Walter Scott--wrote:
<ul><font size=-1>Now is the stately column broke<br>
The beacon-light is quench'd in smoke<br>
The trumpet's silver sound is still<br>
The warden silent on the hill.<br></font></ul>
<br>Thousands attended the lying-in-state.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scott's phrase "stately column" was apt. Inwardly a mercurial man, with wide swings of mood, a short attention span and no family to sustain him, Pitt--like so many other top politicians--protected himself from the outside world by sculpting a statue of himself. And the statue, though contrived, had its own reality. Pitt's aloofness was unfeigned. His confidence in his own capacities was immense. "The image", John Ehrman writes, with characteristic subtlety, "was the ultimate support in easing the tensions of which it was itself a part." Contemporaries, not surprisingly, found him an enigma.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pitt was, as Mr Ehrman notes, one of the last prime ministers able to engage himself in the whole range of his administration's activities. The scope of government was small in the 1800s. Britain was a European, not yet a world-imperial power. Pitt could immerse himself for a time in the details of naval reform (he was an enthusiast for gunboats, with some support from Lord Nelson). Even so, his approach to government was more that of the 19th century than of the 18th. He believed in information, measurement and system. In an age when dilettantes could still flourish in politics, he was a professional.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pitt's claims to being one of the greatest British prime ministers are legion. He towered above his more brilliant but less disciplined contemporaries: Edmund Burke, Charles James Fox and Lord Shelburne. He created a new ruling coalition, comprising the king (the only intermittently demented George III), the City of London and the <i>nouveaux riches</i> (numbers of whom he gartered or ennobled). An ally of William Wilberforce, he won respectable support for a serious attempt to end the slave trade. A disciple of Adam Smith, he did more than anyone before Sir Robert Peel to advance the cause of free trade.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the nine years covered by "The Consuming Struggle"--1797 to 1806, the last of Pitt's life--his record was more mixed. The brutal repression of the 1798 Irish uprising and the patched-up Act of Union that followed only deepened the already deep enmities between Ireland and England and between Catholics and Protestants, especially since Pitt failed in his effort to secure for Irish Catholics full civil rights in their own country. Pitt was also a clumsy and maladroit leader in the wars against France. He was neither a gifted military strategist nor a sound military administrator, and his formidable domestic political skills largely deserted him on the foreign stage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pitt's most enduring achievement of his final years was, typically, a fiscal innovation: the graduated income tax, introduced in 1789 to help finance the French wars. Pitt, who had devoted much of his life to putting his country's finances on a sound footing, was determined not to finance the wars just by raising loans, and a levy on incomes seemed the only alternative. But even in Pitt's day the tax was unpopular--not because it was a tax on incomes as such but because of the "invidious inquisition" (Pitt's own words) that administering it inevitably entailed. Repealed at the end of the French wars, it became a permanent part of the British tax system only in 1842.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Pitt himself was a prodigy, his biographer is, if anything, even more prodigious. This is the final volume of a three-volume life, on which Mr Ehrman has been working for 44 years, almost as long as Pitt lived. The first volume appeared in 1969, the second in 1983. The whole runs to 2,327 pages. The footnotes in the present volume alone defy counting. Writer and subject are so comfortable with one another that the reader imagines them shaking hands on their first meeting in Elysium. Mr Ehrman's judgments are carefully weighed, his prose elegant, his knowledge of politics in the age of Pitt unsurpassed. He can take complete pride in everything he has done.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, he has not quite finished (even though he may justly think he has). A book of this erudition on such a fascinating subject deserves a far wider readership than these three massive volumes will ever achieve. Mr Ehrman (or his helpers) should get down to an abridgement at once.

</ul>




<p>NOW that the Uruguay trade round is over and the World Trade Organisation (<font size=-1>WTO</font>) is at work, why should anybody want to read the story of the negotiations? Arguments over such arcana as agricultural price supports and voluntary export restraints are hardly promising literary material. Yet both Ernest Preeg, an American trade official turned journalist, and John Croome, a veteran of the <font size=-1>GATT</font> civil service, have chosen to write detailed accounts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As might be expected, these books have much content in common. But, as befits a book published by the <font size=-1>WTO</font>, Mr Croome's concentrates more closely than Mr Preeg's on the details of the negotiations. Mr Preeg's book has a broader sweep. It has more, for example, on the way<i>s</i> in which the importance of regional trade initiatives, such as the North American Free-Trade Agreement <i>(</i><font size=-1>NAFTA</font>), grew during the round, partly out of American frustration over the slowness of progress in the <font size=-1>GATT</font> negotiations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike Mr Croome, Mr Preeg concludes by asking: where next for world trade? He points out that the <font size=-1>WTO</font> is not the only show in town: regional agreements will keep growing; and the spectre of aggressive unilateral trade action, especially by the United States, will not go away. Yet his general prognosis for freer trade in the world is optimistic. He may be right, but some of his reasoning is very curious: it is based, he says, "on the four-week period [in late 1993]...when first the United States Congress defeated the blatantly protectionist drive against the <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> and then the Uruguay round was concluded". As the recent popularity of Pat Buchanan on the presidential campaign trail shows, protectionists are not so easily quashed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, these dry histories of trade diplomacy are worth reading--not only (or even mainly) as works of reference on the round itself, but also because the story of the round gives plenty of pointers to the possible future course of global trade liberalisation. There is still much to be done: the Uruguay round made world trade freer, not free.

Country House Brewing in England, 1500-1900
PAMELA SAMBROOK
<p>Until the eighteenth century or even later, beer was the staple drink of most men and women at all levels of society. Tea and coffee were expensive luxuries while water might well carry disease. To supply the needs of both owners and servants, every country house with an accessible source of water had a brewhouse, usually close at hand.</p>
<p>Although many of the brewhouses still stand, in some cases with the original brewing vessels (as at Lacock and Charlecote), conversion to other uses has allowed them to be ignored. Yet they are distinctive buildings - as much part of a country house as an ice-house or stables which need both to be recognised and preserved.</p>
<p>The scale of brewing in country houses, which went on to a surprisingly late date in the nineteenth century (with odd survivals, such as Hickleton in Yorkshire, into the twentieth), was often considerable, if small besides that of commercial brewing. Copious records for both brewing and consumption exist. Pamela Sambrook describes the brewing equipment, such as coppers, mash tuns, underbacks and coolers; the types of beers brewed, from strong ale to small beer, and how they were kept; and the brewers themselves, their skills and attitudes.</p>
<p>English Country House Brewing, 1500-1900 shows the role beer played in the life of the country house, with beer allowances and beer money an integral part of servants' rewards. Generous allowances were made for arduous tasks, such as harvesting. For celebrations, such as the heir's coming of age, extra-strong ale was provided. This book, which is heavily illustrated, is an important and original contribution to architectural, brewing and social history. </p>

PAMELA SAMBROOK was born in Staffordshire and educated at Stoke-on-
Trent and St Hugh's College, Oxford. She received a doctorate from Keele
University for a thesis on the finances of the Anson family:(who became the
Earls of Lichfield). At.Shugborough, the house built by the Ansons, she started
one of the very first farm museums and restored to working order various
kitchens, the house laundry and the brewhouse. With the help of professional
brewers, several successful brews were produced and sold at Shugborough and
at a local pub. Her involvement aroused her interest in country house brewing.
 She teaches at Keele University and the Open University and is actively
involved in the study of food history.

</i>
<p>A VISITOR to Germany, who strays beyond the confines of its cities, is bound to notice the presence, in almost every small town, of a local <i>Brauerei</i> whose mellifluous product is available in the neighbouring inns. The united Germany boasts some 1,300 breweries, diverse in their output but united in high quality.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At one time the many breweries of England's country houses provided a similar diversity. As late as 1800 over half the nation's beer came from such breweries. The beer produced by them represented the last vestiges of the feudal payment in kind. The allowance or "luance" of beer--as much as a gallon a day--to harvest workers, laundrymen, bakers, gardeners, icemen, carpenters and household servants provided the staple national drink before the eventual victory of tea, coffee and other non-alcoholic beverages. To satisfy such demand, country-house breweries turned out prodigious quantities. According to Pamela Sambrook's intriguing study of this "cottage" industry, an annual production of 5,000 gallons of ale and 7,000 gallons of weaker "small beer" was common for many country-house breweries as late as the mid-19th century.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the second half of the 19th century country-house brewing fell into decline. In part this was due to government intervention, industrialisation and the rise of the temperance movement (which turned its attention from spirits to beer in the 1830s). Gladstone's Beer Act of 1880 levied tax on country-house beer at the same rate as commercial beer and seven years later the Truck Act made payment of wages in beer to farm servants illegal. Yet the real problem was that private brewing never achieved the standardised quality needed for selling it in commercial markets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Country-house brewers, unrestricted by law, would flavour their beer with the most miscellaneous ingredients. Hops might be swapped with ground ivy or long pepper, yeast replaced by Castile soap, a mixture of flour and eggs, essential oil or barley and quintessence of malt or wine, while the beer itself might be flavoured with plants, ranging from dandelion to new hay. One early 19th-century observer of private brewing, Thomas Poole, noted among the cures for "foxed" or "ropey" beer additions of chalk, unslaked lime, powdered oyster shells, wormwood, oatmeal, bay salt, isinglass or, most drastically, a mixture of mutton, tartar salt and eggshells. Despite, perhaps because of, these rescue attempts, he saw hundreds of gallons of bad beer thrown away at a time. Quality control, essential to commercialisation, was simply not a country-house forte.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The British Toy Business" also deals with quality troubles. Kenneth Brown observes that by 1850 the toy trade in Britain was so easy to enter and price competition so fierce that quality was deteriorating, sometimes to the extent that the dolls possessed legs "innocent of calves, insteps and ankles" with bodies turned on lathes and "confounding all distinction of front and back, left and right". Soon Germans so dominated the quality end of the British market that the author of an alarmist book "Made in Germany" (1896) complained that "to a large...extent our children's playthings...are made in Germany."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There were technical breakthroughs in early 20th-century British toy-making, such as William Britain's technique for hollow-casting toy soldiers and Frank Hornby's Meccano. But between 1932 and 1960 the industry lived less from innovation than from a long period of import protection. By the 1960s a British consumer group complained that British toys were designed casually, made contemptuously and sold irresponsibly. The end came swiftly. Between 1979 and 1982 five of the top eight domestic manufacturers went into liquidation and along with them the childhood names of Meccano, Airfix, Matchbox, Corgi, Pedigree and Triang. This collapse bears all the familiar marks of British industrial malaise: poor design, poor marketing, bad financial management, inefficient manufacturing combined with bad government policy. The lesson by contrast from the L&ouml;wenbr&auml;u brewery or the Steiff toy factory seems to be: produce a good, popular product to a consistent standard, and your chances of survival are high.

The Brewhouse
<p>This study was stimulated by a particular brewhouse, at Shugborough. The best starting point for this account, therefore, is the evidence of the buildings and fittings which have survived in country house brewhouses, interpreted with the help of contemporary brewing manuals. A discussion of the component parts of the private brewhouse will help with the identification of objects, as well as giving an appreciation of the work involved and the expenses incurred, both in the capital outlay required for building brewhouses and in the long-term commitment to maintenance.</p>
<p>Pause for a moment to record the pleasure which brewhouses have given both to their original owners and to present-day explorers. There is a magic about the country gentleman's brewhouse, captured in this piece of pure romanticism written by Christopher North in the last century about his own estate in Scotland:</p>
<p><ul> A gentleman's brewhouse, like his greenhouse, his hothouse, his dairy, or even his cellar, is no such unpleasant place . . . There is our own brewhouse at Buchanan Lodge; it might pass for a summer- house . . . It stands . . . at the back of the house, just at the edge of the little ravine or dell, and half hid by the laburnums. It is also separated from the other offices by a lowish beech hedge. Around, below, and opposite are growing the wild cherry, the tall chestnut, the sycamore, the fir, the thorn, and the bramble, which clothe the sides of the deep glen. From its chimneys, as soon as the soft March gales begin to blow, curls the white smoke before the hour of dawn. The fire within burns brightly. Everything is clean and 'sweet as the newly-tedded hay'. Precisely as six o'clock strikes we march forth . . . with our old fishing jacket and our apron on; our old velvet study cap about our ears, and our thermometer in our hand. The primroses are basking in the morning rays; the dewdrops are sparkling the last upon the leaves; the unseen violets are breathing forth sweets; the blackbird trills his mellow notes in the thicket; the wren twitters in the hedge; and the redbreast hops around the door.'</ul></p>
<p>Even in their present state of decay, it is fairly obvious that over centuries the design of brewhouses developed very much along standardised lines. Regional variations exist in building materials and architectural styles, but the consistency of internal functional features over both time and place is remarkable. Whiles it may be that greater regional variations will become obvious as more examples are studied, the standardisation of fittings surely implies a technology which changed little over long periods of time.</p>
<p>The design of surviving brewhouses may show a high degree of technological stability but what were its origins? The country house brewhouse derives from an even older and a much simpler tradition - that of making beer at home over an open domestic hearth. This would have been laborious work, but no more so than many other culinary or household chores. A weekly brew occupied space around the hearth, but would be economical as the fire could be used for ordinary cooking at the same time. There was, however, clearly a restriction on the size of brew which could be accommodated; brewing would therefore be frequent and the beer not expected to last long. Eventually, a large cauldron over the open fire might well prove inadequate in size and be replaced by larger copper or brass fumaces.</p>
<p>Probate inventories of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries show frequent mention of furnaces; since only movable equipment was usually included in such inventories, these were presumably not permanently bricked in; but they would too large to hang over an open fire like a cooking pot, so they would need some sort of brick surround from which they could be lifted; rare surviving examples have handles at the side. Presumably such furnaces might also have been used out-of-doors or for other purposes, such as boiling meat. </p>

Conception
<p>On a summer's day shortly before the outbreak of the First World War C. F. G. Masterman, a junior Minister in Herbert Asquith's Liberal Government, called to see his friend, H. G. Wells. He found the famous writer deeply absorbed in a game of toy soldiers which he was playing with another Cabinet member, Sidney Buxton. The President of the Board of Trade was 'sprawled full length on the floor and with unerring accuracy picking off the flower of Wells' Imperial Guard, which he thought he had concealed and protected in a thick pine forest'. Masterman was not in the least surprised by this somewhat unlikely scene. On previous occasions he had himself participated in similar games. The most memorable had lasted all day and ended only when Buxton's 'magnificent shot from the other end of the nursery' had 'destroyed a missionary fleeing on a dromedary - the last representative of the nation which had marched so gaily into battle so many hours before'.</p>
<p>It is tempting to speculate on the deeper significance of such martial preoccupations on the part of Britain's political leaders in the days immediately before 1914, but such war games were nothing new.' As early as 1760 Laurence Sterne had portrayed Tristram Shandy's Uncle Toby ploughing up the family bowling green in order to play out a miniaturised version of Marlborough's campaigns against Louis XIV. Sadly, his fortifications proved vulnerable, though not to the cannons which he made by melting down the lead weights from the sash windows. Rather, they were mortally damaged by nocturnal activities, first of a marauding cow and then of some amorous interplay between Corporal Trim and a servant girl. These resulted in the complete destruction of a drawbridge, 'somehow or other crushed all to pieces'. Apart from the obvious gap between fiction and fact, there was one other essential difference between the games played by Shandy's uncle on the one hand and those of Wells on the other. Whereas the former had to make for himself all the necessary equipment, Wells was able to buy everything he required from ordinary retail outlets. In the intervening 200 years a new industry, the commercial manufacture of playthings for children and hobbyists, had grown up in Britain.</p>
<p>During the twentieth century toy and game making has assumed many of the characteristics of modern big business - national and international trade associations, government regulations on standards and safety, multinational corporations, annual production and trade running into millions of pounds, and a domestic market worth about a billion pounds a year. Yet the emergence and development of British toy manufacturing have not attracted much attention from professional historians: 'The rise of toy making as an industry', observes one popular history of toys, 'is a mysterious process. Its history has seldom been charted.' Children's toys, it seems, have become so much a part of modern- life that their existence and the processes by which they have been provided are taken largely for granted. As G. G. Bartley complained in 1876, contemporaries were </p>

 A History since 1700
 KENNETH D. BROWN
<p>At its height British toymaking was a significant industry, with famous names such as Britains and Meccano known throughout the world. While in essence a specialised form of small-scale engineering, its products and market have always been unique, reflecting the current priorities of both parents and children. Yet, while individual toys and marques have been catalogued extensively, no previous history of toymaking as a whole exists. The British Toy Business provides a fascinating example of the development of a specific industry over a period of 300 years.</p>
<p>Many early toys were home made. From the eighteenth century, with its growing recognition of children as something other than small adults, date the beginnings of specialised toys, usually produced by small workshops and sold by street-sellers. The nineteenth century, with its industrial growth and middle- class prosperity, saw an expansion of toymaking.</p>
<p>The early twentieth century and the years between the wars saw the heyday of firms such as Hornby and Britains, yet British toy makers failed to solve a number of fundamental problems. Marketing and financial control remained weak, and British companies were slow to realise the potential of computerised games. Following an unexpected sudden downturn in sales at a time of high interest rates, several of the major names in British toy making, including Lesney, Airfix, Mettoy and Dunbee Combex Marx, collapsed between 1979 and 1983, leaving the business to be dominated largely by importers. </p>

Nowhere in the world is weather as volatile and powerful as it is in North
America. Scorching heat in the South-wet, hurricanes on the Atlantic coast,
tornadoes in the Plains, blizzards in the mountains: Every area of the country
has vastly different weather, the vastly different cultures as a result. Braving the
Elements is David Laskin's delightful and fascinating history of how our
unique weather has shaped a nation, and how we've tried to cope with  it over
the centuries.
<p>Since before Columbus, the people of America have struggled to make sense of the capricious and violent nature of American weather. Anasazi Indians used the rain dance (and sometimes human sacrifice) to induce rain, while the Puritans in New England blamed the sins of the community for lightning strikes and nor'easters. In modern times we carry on those traditions by blaming the weatherman for ruined weekends. Despite hi-tech satellites and powerful computers and 24-hour-a-day forecasting from The Weather Channel, we're still at the mercy of the whims of Mother Nature.</p>
<p>Laskin recounts the many dramatic moments in American weather history, form the "Little Ice Age" to Ben Franklin's invention of the lightning rod to the Great Blizzard of 1988 to the Dust Bowl of the 1930s to the worries about global warming. Packed with fresh insights and wonderful lore and trivial, Braving the Elements is unique and essential reading for anyone who's ever asked: "What's it like outside?" </p>

<h2>You do need a weatherman</h2><ul> <li><a href="7ex210.html">B<font size=-1>RAVING</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> E<font size=-1>LEMENTS</a>:</font> T<font size=-1>HE</font> S<font size=-1>TORMY</font> H<font size=-1>ISTORY</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> A<font size=-1>MERICAN</font> W<font size=-1>EATHER</font>.&nbsp;  By David Laskin. <br>
</ul>

<p>FEW things except other people's dreams are as dull as other people's weather. Extremes here make no difference. Weather that is always hot (Sahara), always cold (Antarctica) or always changing (England) is reliably dire. To be worth talking about, weather has to be unpredictable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The skies between the Gulf Stream waters and the redwood forests pass this test. Moving house in Kansas can mean getting caught in a tornado. Winter storms trap East Coasters inside for days. March frosts kill Florida oranges while sunshine bakes Alaska. Save possibly during August nobody in Oregon can ever tell you when it will stop raining.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nothing has shaped life in North America more than the weather, according to David Laskin, a self-confessed "weather nut". You do not need to swallow that claim whole to find this history fascinating. Prehistoric man, he writes, crossed the Bering Strait because of the weather. South-western Indian civilizations crumbled, he argues, because of its pitiless power. European explorers may have sailed to America in part to escape the consequences of a mini-permafreeze back home.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the colonial era, many leading Americans were also "weather nuts", including Cotton Mather, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. On July 4th 1776, the day independence was declared, Jefferson bought a pricey thermometer, followed a few days later by an expensive barometer--perhaps, Mr Laskin muses in a moment of patriotic sentiment, to "wipe the meteorological slate clean and begin afresh with the best new instruments..."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many pioneers went West assured that "rain follows the plough" even in parched regions--a misconception brutally refuted in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. James Pollard Espy, a mid-19th century scientist known as "the Storm King", was luckily never able to test his proposal for coaxing rain out of western skies: torching a 700-mile-long stretch of forest every week.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Laskin is particularly good on meteorologists and on why people often prefer forecasts from weathermen (and women) to impersonal weather services. The old Weather Bureau once had to plead with a Denver newspaper to spike a popular weekly forecast that ran side by side with the official one. The competing prognosticator, who usually beat the professionals for accuracy, was a 90-year-old veteran who based his forecast on how a war wound felt that week.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A chapter is spent on the National Weather Service's tracking of "the storm of the century" in 1993. But last winter another storm came--too late for this book--that made 1993's a dim memory. That was bad luck for Mr Laskin, but bears out a more general point of his: people's weather memories are selective. Research suggests that drought survivors routinely underestimate the frequency and severity of droughts. And in the debate over global warming--a subject Mr Laskin treats with admirable detachment--climate is frequently confused with weather, which is here today, gone tomorrow--or next month.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
1. NATIVE AMERICAN WEATHER
<p>THE HUMAN SPECIES WAS BORNE INTO AMERICA ON A WAVE OF cataclysmic climatic change. For millions of years, our human ancestors evolved and spread through the Old World emerging in Africa some two to three million years ago, then migrating into the Middle East, north into Europe, and east to Asia--while the two continents of the New World remained inviolable, sealed off from the transforming touch of man. Then the earth, of its own accord, breached the seal of the Americas. About 100,000 years ago, global temperatures once again started to fall and the ice cap that crusts the North Pole began its fourth radial advance south ward, gradually but relentlessly swallowing the tundra of northern Canada, crushing the northern landscapes beneath an enormous wall of ice, chilling and paralyzing the oceans. As more and more of the world's water turned to ice, ocean levels dropped--sinking more than 280 feet beneath their present maximum at the height of the glaciation--and huge shelves of dry, barren ground emerged at the margins of the North American continent. At the extreme northwest of the landmass, where the fifty-odd-mile Bering Strait now separates Alaska's Seward Peninsula from Siberia's Chukchi</p>
<p>Peninsula, a broad, flat land bridge became exposed to the frigid glacial winds. For 41,000 years during the last glacial period--from about 75,000 to 45,000 years ago and again from about 25,000 to 14,000 years ago, when melting glacial ice began to resubmerge the bridge for all time--this land bridge joined North America and Asia as continental Siamese twins. </p>

<h2>What the world is reading</h2>

<p>SOME national stereotypes simply refuse to die. If bestsellers are a guide, paranoid Americans are beset by hidden foes. A serial killer, recombined dinosaurs, a bogus general, a judge on trial and runaway bacteria are all currently some of their favourite fears.</p>
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nostalgic Brits continue a wistful love-affair with more heroic pasts and indulge their fondness for animals that talk. Three of the British bestsellers are war-time novels. Another continues trading in the antique genre of cold-war spying. The wry tales in ''Cross Channel" play on the English longing to be French and relief at not being.</p>
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is no surprise that on the French list literary novels (see adjoining article) jostle pot-boilers. But the emphasis on childhood is astonishing. Six of the ten novels listed star the young, eight if the back-to-roots exile books are counted. Is romanticism sweeping France? Has wide-eyed Rousseau outdone sardonic Voltaire? Amid smashed ideals and public scandal, innocence evidently appeals.</p>
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The land of exports reads imports. One only of Germany's top ten is German. No theme stands out among the other nine: Germans, it seems, will read almost anything in translation. National self-loathing? Likelier, too much self-preoccupation among German novelists.

AFTER General Franco's death in 1975 Spain seemed to leap frantically into the modern mode, especially in its two competing cities, Madrid and Barcelona, in what was known as the <i>movida</i>. Stylish, fun-loving and forgetful of the long dreary dictatorship, Spanish culture was best personified by film maker Pedro Almodovar's outrageous kitsch and daring transgressions. Moral censorship melted away, and writers (and readers) indulged in sexual fantasies. Almudena Grandes, born in 1960, won a porno fiction prize in 1989 for her novel "Las Edades de Lulu" (The Ages of Lulu), but moved beyond porno pastiche with "Malena es un nombre de tango" (Malena is the name of a tango) in 1994, released as a film this year. This sprawling, passionate novel is narrated by Malena, the tomboy twin discovering her rebellious self through her sexual awakening, first lover (a cousin), husband, and work in Madrid, as she simultaneously pokes her nose into her complicated family history. The novel satisfies any reader's curiosity about a family skeleton-cupboard with vivid portraits of the odder characters against a realistic backdrop of upper-middle-class Madrid and a country estate near Caceres. Revealing family secrets is treated as politically therapeutic on the ground that "the greatest crime of Francoism has been the kidnapping of the whole country's memory". This novel is a "Buddenbrooks" narrated by a bright, naughty woman at odds with her world, liberating her animal self.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Almudena Grandes's latest offering in the bestseller list is a collection of longish short stories called "Modelos de Mujer" (Models of Woman). All the stories are told by women, but Ms Grandes rejects the notion of feminist literature, and claims to write "to get even with the world". What strikes a reader is the range of these stories, though all deal with love. The book opens with a ghost story in a woman's asylum where a chorus of female voices allows the reader to piece together the humorous appearance of a ghost anarchist murdered during the civil war. The second story is a light-hearted account of an overweight middle-aged woman's re-encounter with a past lover, her food problems, her life expectancies. Ms Grandes is acute on colloquial speech, on how contemporary clich&eacute;s enter her characters' inner lives. There is a story about vengeance where a girl eats the grubs prepared by her grandfather for catching fish. Another story has an alcoholic mother tame her sexy, rebellious daughter with secret doses of some illegal drug in order to say she has a model daughter. The two best stories are built up on exact social satire, yet touch deeper chords. The title story, "Modelos de Mujer", opposes a beauty queen on a film set in New York with her vital but plump Spanish minder (many of Ms Grandes's female narrators are big women, and suffer from fashion).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The final story is a moving account of being brought up by a maid in Madrid. The middle-aged narrator discovers, or invents, that she was not her bullying, crippled mother's daughter, but her maid's illegitimate one, and finally runs off with her lover, as her nanny had done before, after arranging a nursing home for her dictatorial mother. All the stories are funny, all deal with love, fashion, modern Madrid, and liberation. Ms Grandes mocks the trivial modernity of 1990s Madrid, and pleads for more passion "because passion carefully chooses its victims".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Arturo Perez-Reverte's sixth novel, "La Piel del Tambor" (The Skin of the Drum), sets out to capture the tensions in modern Spain, and opens with a hacker breaking into secret files in the Vatican. Mr Perez-Reverte is a master of intelligent suspense, and reader-friendly action. The ramifying plot has Lorenzo Quart, an investigating soldier-like priest, sent by the Vatican's office of foreign affairs to track down this hacker and report on the scandals and deaths surrounding an old baroque church in post-Expo-1992 Seville. Inevitably, there is a power tussle between a corrupt banker and his separated, aristocratic wife over the demolition of a church and the consequent property deal, with an astronomy-addicted but traditional priest in the middle.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This priest, Don Priamo Ferro, sells off church paintings to restore his church, and fights the developers with his assistant, an American lay nun. The old Spain, embodied by this priest who still gives mass in Latin, by gipsy scoundrels, by the labyrinth of Seville's streets, and the new Spain of computers, faxes, gold cards, trilingual secretaries and pony-tailed policemen meet in the streets of Seville (a map is provided). The investigating priest, Quart, talks to everybody, and steps beyond his neutrality to defend the traditional Catholic values of faith; then the plot reaches its climax with the murder of the journalist, as the old priest is accused and then kidnapped by a rival faction. In a Graham Greene-like way, Mr Perez-Reverte contrasts the moral flaws of Quart, the modern priest, succumbing to a woman and the church's betrayals with crooked property developers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This novel, in fact, is an update of Spain's greatest 19th-century novel "La Regenta" by Leopoldo Alas, which anatomised Spain through the character of Machiavellian priests. However, more than dissecting current Spain, Mr Perez-Reverte is playfully modern in an Umberto Eco way, with many textual clues in the plot, from actual postcards to quotations from treatises to Quart's strange name (possibly the keyboard sequence 'qwert'), and a journalist jokingly called Bonafe, but such post-modernistic tics do not interfere with a smoothly written, realist novel. The priest Quart does not run off with the sexy aristocrat and the hacker turns out to be a 70-year-old duquesa. The novel is also a hymn to Seville where everybody knows everybody ("Sevilla is a neighbourhood patio; we love gossip"), a city where the "past lives with the present, without any problems".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, recent Spanish fiction is not all "light" and "modern". Not every writer suffers from historical amnesia or caters to trends, as if reality were an Almodovar movie. Recent work by any of the following--Antonio Mu&ntilde;oz Molina, Alvaro Pombo, Javier Marias, Carmen Martin Gaite--would contradict that idea. However, the most striking novel that moves away from recreating Old Spain-New Spain dichotomies is the experimental "Viaje de Estudios" (Study Trip) by Menchu Gutierrez, born in 1957. The novel leaps from realism (a train journey inland, class rooms, a monastery) into a disconcerting parable of a Kafkaesque nature where orphans at a university take what you can only surmise is an initiate's journey, with a confessor and a teacher as guides, into a timeless zone with frightening black holes and even stranger white holes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The narrator's final act of self-discovery involves an acceptance of incoherence as belonging to the nature of things: behind the world of the senses and common sense lie physical surprises and conundrums that upset tidy habits of mind. Ambitious burble? Not at all. Talk from serious physicists of time travel or parallel universes must make writers worry that the imagination has deserted their world for science. Ms Gutierrez tries admirably to keep up with modernity, without recourse to flashy, post-modernist stunts.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Pacita tenia los ojos verdes, siempre abiertos, y labios de india, como los mios,
que cerraba rozandolos apenas, entre las comisuras el hueco suficiente para
franquear el paso a un delgado hilo de baba blanca que se escurria despacio,
estancandose a veces al borde de la barbilla. Era una criatura abrumadoramente
hermosa, la mas guapa de las hijas de mi abuela, el cabello espeso, castano y
ondulado, una nariz dificil, perfecta en cada perfil, el cuello largo, lujoso, y una
linea impecable, de arrogante belleza, uniendo la rigida elegancia de la
mandibula con la tensa blandura de un escote color caramelo, al que aquellos
grotescos vestidos de mujer consciente de su cuerpo que ella nunca eligio
otorgaban una fabulosa y cruel relevancia. Nunca la vi de pie, pero sus piernas
agiles, compactas, la robustez que matizaba el brillo de unas medias de nailon
que jamas se vieron expuestas a suErir herida alguna, no merecian el destino al
que las aboco para siempre el implacable sindrome de nombre anglosajon que
paralizo su desarrollo neuronal cuando aun no habia aprendido a mantener la
cabeza erguida. Desde entonces, nada habia cambiado, y nada cambiaria jamas,
para aquel eterno bebe de tres meses. Pacita ya habia cumplido veinticuatro
anos, pero solo su padre la llamaba Paz.
<p>Yo estaba escondida detras del castafio de Indias y recuerdo las pequenas esferas erizadas de pinchos que asomaban entre las hoias, asi que debiamos estar en primavera, quizas ya en la frontera del verano, y supongo que me faltaba poco para cumplir nueve anos, tal vez diez, pero seguro que era domingo, porque todos los domingos, despues de oir misa de doce, ibamos con mama a tomar el aperitivo a casa de los abuelos, un sombrio palacete de tres pisos con jardin, Martinez Campos casi esquina con Zurbano, que ahora es la sede espanola de un banco belga. Cuando hacia buen tiempo, Pacita estaba siempre a la sombra de la higuera, atada a una silla de ruedas especial con tres correas, una sobre el pecho, otra en la cintura, y una tercera, la mas gruesa, entre aquella y el extremo del asiento, para evitar que se escurriera y se cayera al suelo, y apenas distinguia su silueta entre los barrotes de la verja, yo fijaba la vista precisamente alli, en la grava, el unico lugar donde estaba segura de no poder verla, y trataba de disimular las huellas de un tormento semanal, colorado y caliente, la inexplicable verguenza que arrasaba mi cuerpo en llamas feroces mientras escuchaba el impudico concierto de palabritas que mi madre y mi hemmana, como todas las demas mujeres de la familia, dedicaban a coro a mi pobre tia, aquella torpe bestia imbecil que no podia verlas mientras contemplaba el mundo con sus dos ojos verdes, siempre abiertos, siempre abrumadoramente hermosos y vacios.</p>
<p>--Hola!--decia mi madre, como si estuviera encantada de tropezarsela, poniendo morritos y chasqueando la lengua ritmicamente contra el paladar, como se hace para llamar la atencion de los bebes autenticos, los ninos que miran, y al mirar escuchan, y al escuchar aprenden--Hola, Pacita, carino! Como estas, cielo? Que buen dia hace hoy!, eh?, menuda suerte, toda la manana al sol!</p>
<p>--Pacita, Pacita!--la llamaba Reina, ladeando altemativamente la cabeza a un lado y a otro--. Cucu... Tras! Cucu... Tras, tras!</p>
<p>Y la cogian de la mano, y acariciaban sus rodillas, y la pellizcaban en la cara, y le arreglaban la falda, y daban palmitas, y hacian los cinco lobitos, y sonreian todo el tiempo, como si estuvieran muy contentas de si mismas, muy satisfechas de estar haciendo lo que habia que hacer, mientras yo las miraba desde lejos, haciendome la loca a sus espaldas por Si colaba, pero no colaba nunca.</p>
<p>--Malena!--antes o despues, mi madre volvia la cabeza para encontrarme--No le dices nada a Pacita?</p>
<p>--Hola, Pacita--cantaba yo entonces, mi voz degradandose contra mi voluntad hasta quedar reducida a un ridiculo susurro--. Que tal, Pacita, que tal?</p>
<p>Y yo tambien la cogia de la mano, que siempre estaba fria, y siempre humeda, y viscosa de babas y de una maloliente mezcla de restos de papilla y crema perfumada, y la miraba a los ojos y lo que veia en ellos me estremecia de miedo, y me sentia tan culpable del asco egoista que Pacita me inspiraba, que entonces, cada mafiana de domingo, con mas intensidad, con mas pasion que nunca, le rogaba a la Virgen que me concediera aquel pequeno milagro privado, y durante el resto de la manana, mientras pemmanecia cautiva en aquella casa odiosa, rezaba sin parar, siempre en silencio, Virgen Santa, Madre Mia, hazme este favor y no te pedire nada mas en toda mi vida, anda, si no es dificil, a ti no te cuesta trabajo.. Mis primos varones no saludaban a Pacita, no tenian que besarla, m acariciarla, no la tocaban nunca. </p>

<h2>M<font size=-1>ODELOS DE</font> M<font size=-1>UJER</font>.<br></h2>
<p> By Almudena Grandes.<br>
<i> Tusquets Editores; 248 pages; Ptas 2,000.</i><br>
</p><br>
<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Los primeros diez anos de mi infancia transcurrieron en un piso segundo, con
un pasillo inmenso y muy poca luz, de un edificio bastante corriente--una
mancha roja de ladrillo visto, apenas rota por las molduras blancas que
dibujaban una ceja de yeso descascarillado sobre cada balcon, completando
cuatro ojos por planta--un ejemplar tipico, casi vulgar, de las construcciones
que, en el siglo pasado, imprimieron caracter, y hasta personalidad, al barrio de
Madrid donde ha sucedido la mayor parte de los episodios de mi vida y de mis
libros. La calle Churruca, corta y estrecha, nace en la plaza de Barcelo y va a
morir, casi sin darse cuenta, en la calle Sagasta, al lado de la glorieta de Bilbao,
que para mi siempre ha sido y sera el verdadero centro de la ciudad. Muy cerca
de la esquina con Apodaca, sobre la oscura fachada de otra casa, c orriente, una
placa pequena, excesivamente idiscreta para la mirada del transeunte que no
ande busc-andola, identifica el ultimo domicilio del poeta Manuel Machado.
--Pues era tan bueno como su hermano...--decia mi padre cada domingo, un
instante antes de doblar la esquina, camino de la calle de Fuencarral y la casa
de mi abuelo.
<p>Mi padre es poeta, y su padre tambien lo era, y por eso yo empece muy pronto a fijamme en las placas de las calles y a aprenderme poemas de memoria, pero el motivo que se escondia tras nuestra obligada visita de los domingos, una cita de puntualidad inquebrantable, pertenecia al rango de los mas prosaicos. Padre e- hijo se reunian ante el televisor para contemplar juntos el partido de la liga de fiitbol que la primera cadena retransmitiera aquella semana, sin fijarse mucho en la calidad de los equipos que iban a enfrentarse, en su clasificacion, o en cualquier otro detalle quezpudiera anadir o restar interes al espectaculo. Ellos veian el futbol, simplemente. Y todos los demas teniamos que estar callados.</p>
<p>La casa de mi abuelo--tan caracteristica del paisaje de mi barrio como la de mis padres, pero mejor, mas grande, casi senorial--podria haberse confundido con el escenario de muchas de las novelas madrilenas de Galdos. En la zona exterior, las habitaciones amplias, de altisimos techos, no desembocaban en pasilla alguno, sino que se abrian unas a otras para forrnar una pequena red gde espacio compartido--todos esos huecos ciegos que se designan airosamente como gabinetes en la que era muy dificil imponer un silencio uniforme. Para lograrlo, las mujeres de mi familia, que pasaban el rato alrededor de una mesa camilla, cotilleando entre susurros, desterraban a los ninos al comedor, y nos obligaban a entretenemos </p>

El pirata informatico se infiltro en el sistema central del Vaticano once minutos
antes de la medianoche. Treinta y cinco segundos mas tarde, uno de los
ordenadores conectados a la red principal dio la alarma. Fue solo un parpadeo
en la pantalla del monitor, anunciando la puesta automatica en funcionamiento
del control de seguridad ante una intromision exterior. Despues, las letrasK HK
aparecieron en un angulo de la pantalla, y el funcionario de guardia, un jesuita
que en ese momento trabajaba en la incorporacion de datos sobre el ultimo
censo del Estado Pontificio, descolgo el telefono para avisar al jefe de servicio.
<p>--Tenemos un hacker--anuncio.</p>
<p>Abrochandose la sotana, el padre Ignacio Arregui, otro jesuita, salio al pasillo para recorrer los cincuenta metros hasta la sala de ordenadores. Era huesudo y flaco, con zapatos que crujian bajo los frescos en penumbra. Mientras caminaba echo un vistazo a traves de las ventanas, hacia la desierta Via della Tipografia y la fachada oscura del palacio Belvedere, y murmuro discretamente, entre dientes. Su malhumor provenia mas de haber sido despertado mientras descabezaba un sueno que de la aparicion del intruso. Las incursiones de estos eran frecuentes, pero inofensivas. Solian limitarse al perimetro de seguridad exterior, dejando leves huellas de su paso: mensajes o pequenos virus. A un pirata informatico--hacker en jerga tecnica--le gustaba que los demas supieran que habia estado alli. Por lo general se trataba de chicos muy jovenes, aficionados a viajar a traves de las lineas telefonicas explorando los sistemas ajenos en busca del mas dificil todavia. Para los yonquis del chip, adictos de la alta tecnologia, probar suerte con el Chase Manhattan Bank, el Pentagono o el Vaticano, suponia siempre una excitante aventura.</p>
<p>El funcionario de guardia era el padre Cooey, otro jesuita irlandes joven y grueso, que usaba lentes. Fruncia el ceno con preocupacion, inclinado sobre las teclas de su ordenador tras el rastro informatico del pirata. Cuando llego a su lado, el padre Arregui vio que levantaba los ojos con expresion de alivio. La luz de su lampara de trabajo le iluminaba la parte inferior del rostro. --No sabe lo que me alegra verlo, padre. </p>

<p><b>Biography</p></b>
Almudena Grandes nacio en 1960 en Madrid, donde sigue viviendo hasta
ahora. Tras estudiar geografia e historia en la Universidad Complutense, realizo
toda suerte de trabajos editoriales. En enero de 1989, gano el XI Premio La
sonrisa vertical de narrativa erotica con Las edades de Lulu (La sonrisa vertical
61), que ha sido traducidos cerca de un millon de ejemplares en el mundo
entero. Te llamare Viernes (Andanzas 136), que tenia en proceso de escritura
cuando publico la novela anterior, aparecio en 1991 y fue tambien muy bien
acogida. A nadie se le escapa la importancia que, en su excepcional trayectoria
literaria, desempena Malena es un nombre de tango, su esperandisima tercera
novela. Pero Almudena Grandes no abandona la osadia con la que emprende
cada una de sus obras sin por ello traicionar su personalisimo mundo literario,
sus intimas obsesiones y su propio estilo.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
THE INFAMOUS DICTATORS of the twentieth century, Hitler, Mussolini,
Stalin, Ceausescu, and Mao Tse-tung were all unscrupulous in the pursuit of
power and ruthless in eliminating enemies. Dictators cannot afford the luxury
of friends. Although they may marry and rear families, they depend primarily
upon the plaudits of the unknown multitude rather than on true affection from
intimates to maintain their self-esteem. It is not surprising that leaders of this
type become suspicious, often to the point of paranoia. The crowd is fickle and
easily swayed. Dictators who depend upon popular acclaim and propaganda
alone can be unseated by the adverse events which plague all political leaders.
If a dictator is to hold on to power even when the country is in trouble, he must
ensure that he is totally in control and that no rival has a chance of supplanting
him. To do so requires the apparatus of informers, secret police, and spies
which is so characteristic of dictatorial regimes. The number of people who
have been banished, imprisoned, tortured, or executed for no reason other than
that a dictator perceived them as possible threats to his position is beyond
computation. Moreover, it is those who are high in the dictator's hierarchy who
are most likely to be seen as threatening. Paradoxically, the 'friends' and allies
on whom a normal leader might depend for advice and support during crises,
often constitute the greatest threat to the paranoid dictator. Hitler's purge of
Ernst Rohm and his Stormtrooper lieutenants in I934 is a typical example.
Hitler owed a great deal to Rohm, who had supported him from his earliest
days in Munich, but this did not save him when he became a threat. Both Stalin
and Mao Tse-tung disposed of their closest associates without hesitation.
<p>As we shall see, some gurus are dictators on a small scale. Although their message is ostensibly religious rather than political, they behave like dictators, thrive on adulation, have no true friends, attempt to exercise absolute power, and are afflicted by the same kind of paranoid suspicions. Let us look at two gurus who fit this description.</p>
<p>On November 18, 1978, over nine hundred people, including two hundred and sixty children, drank or were injected with cyanide in Jonestown, Guyana. This self-annihilation of the members of the People's Temple was ordered by its founder, Jim Jones, who himself died of a gunshot wound to the head. On April 19, 1993, eighty-six people, including twenty-two children, perished in the flames of Ranch Apocalypse, Waco, Texas. This self-immolation was at the instigation of the cult leader David Koresh, who also died of a gunshot wound to the head.</p>
<p>There are other remarkable resemblances between the two gurus. In childhood, both were rather isolated boys who had few friends amongst contemporaries. Both became eloquent, fluent preachers who could harangue their listeners for hours at a time, battering their audiences into submission by the apparently endless flow of words. Both were entirely unscrupulous sexually; Jim Jones with both sexes, David Koresh with young children as well as with adults. Both were physically cruel, inflicting vicious punishments upon any member of their respective cults who was deemed guilty of infringing the arbitrary rules which they had instituted. Both did all they could to prevent their disciples leaving the cult, by underrnining family ties, by threatening dire punishments, and by posting armed guards who were as much concerned with keeping people in as with protecting the enclosures from intruders, although very few disciples wanted to leave. Both exhibited obsessional traits of character and paranoid anxieties which led to their stockpiling weapons against the attacks which they were expecting. Both hovered on the brink of insanity for a considerable part of their lives, and both ended up as demonstrably psychotic. </p>

There are said to be at least six hundred New Religious Movements in Britain,
and many more in other parts of the world. They range from benign, charitable
organizations to corrupt, dangerous cults which may end in murder or mass
suicide. Since cults have a special appeal to the young, anxious parents have
prompted a good deal of research into who joins cults and why. Less has heen
written about the gurus who institute and lead such movements.
<p>Gurus are extraordinary individllals who cast doubt upon current psychiatric distinctions between sanity and madness. A guru convinces others that he knows - a persuasive capacity which can bring illumination but which may also end in disaster. Anthony Storr's new book is a study of some of the best-known gurus, ranging from monsters such as Jim Jones or David Koresh, to some of the most respected leaders in the western world - Ignatius of Loyola, Jesus himself. It includes both Freud and Jung because, as Storr demonstrates, what ostensibly began as a scientific investigation became, in each case, a secular path to salvation.</p>
<p>Storr shows, with characteristic and humane insight, how all of these have more in common than meets the eye. Why do we classify some of them as legitimate thinkers or spiritual leaders and others as madmen? Storr shows how the apparently mad and the apparently sane are not different in kind but simply appear in different parts of the spectrum of sanity, how behaviour which is regarded as normal and that which is thought eccentric, dangerous or mad are really two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Feet of Clay is one of Anthony Storr's most original and illuminating books. It discusses a dimension of the human personality, charismatic leadership, which often excites much curiosity but which no one until now has been able to explain satisfactorily. It ends with reflections upon why human beings need gurus at all, and indicates how those in need of guidance can distinguish the false and dangerous from the genuine and good. </p>

<p><b>Gurus</b></p>
<h2>Magnetic</h2><ul> <li><a href="8ex233.html">F<font size=-1>EET</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> C<font size=-1>LAY</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Anthony Storr. <br>
</ul>

<p>WHEN Martin Gardner published the second edition of his "Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science" in 1957, he noted that most of the outraged letters which greeted its first publication had objected only to one chapter while praising all the rest. These critics did not, however, agree about which chapter was the unfair one. Each of the irate correspondents enjoyed seeing the fallacies of others debunked. They were just angry to find their own pet fads treated alongside them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anthony Storr can expect a similarly mixed mailbag after this excellent book, subtitled "A Study of Gurus". Followers of Freud may chortle over Gurdjieff (chapter two), but will probably frown when they get to chapter six (Freud). Jesuits and some others may be pleased to see Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh bagged (chapter three), but be less happy with chapter seven (the Jesuits and Jesus). Yet Dr Storr is more tender-hearted than Mr Gardner. Except for his treatment of recent gurus who turned murderous (Jim Jones and David Koresh), the engaging Dr Storr is always ready to find the honest, beneficent and even beneficial side of his subjects.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This study has twin attractions. Anyone who has ever wondered what Rudolf Steiner or Gurdjieff actually said, but who has been forgivably wary of devoting any time to the writings of these men, will find an intelligible account of their incredible views. Gurdjieff's theory of the solar system, for instance, gives a new meaning to the old term "lunatic" and should not be missed. But this is also a book with a thesis. Dr Storr argues that gurus are not so much distinguished from the average person by what they believe, more by how they believe it. One intriguing suggestion he makes is that the deviants with whom gurus have most in common are those confidence-tricksters whose remarkable success is due to the fact that they have partly conned themselves before they get round to conning others.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The theme of "Feet of Clay" is continuity: there is no obvious gulf separating sanity from madness and one shades into the other by barely perceptible degrees. The guru's philosophy grows out of motives and experiences that are widely shared. This generous attempt to run roads from the suburbs of the soul out to the wilder shores of humanity may make it easier for Christians and Freudians to accept the company into which Dr Storr ushers them. Both Freud and Jesus may be gurus in Dr Storr's sense, but this does not necessarily make them mad, bad and dangerous to follow.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, "The wisest men", according to Euripides, "follow their own direction/ And listen to no prophet guiding them." This quotation from "Iphigenia in Tauris" forms the epigraph and moral of Dr Storr's book. His favourite guru appears to be Mother Meera, who specialises in silence. "It may sound ridiculous to suggest that, if someone must seek a guru it is best to choose one who does not speak, but I mean it at least half-seriously." This view is partly supported by his own working experience as a psychologist. He recalls a patient who lay mute on the couch for 50 minutes. He had followed her lead and remained silent himself, whereupon the patient announced that it had been their best meeting so far.

<h2>T<font size=-1>HE</font> E<font size=-1>ND</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> S<font size=-1>CIENCE</font>.<br></h2>
<p> By John Horgan. <br>
<i>Addison-Wesley; 309 pages; $24.00.</i><br>
</p><br>
<a href="8bt255.html">Biography</a>
<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
As a staff writer for Scientific American, John Horgan has a window on
contemporary science unsurpassed in all the world. Who else routinely
interviews the likes of Lynn Margulis, Roger Penrose, Francis Crick, Richard
Dawkins, Freeman Dyson, Murray Gell-Mann, Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen
Hawking, Thomas Kuhn, Chris Langton, Karl Popper, Steven Weinberg, and E.
O. Wilson, with the freedom to probe their innermost thoughts?
<p>In The End of Science, Horgan displays his genius for getting these larger-than- life figures to be simply human, and scientists, he writes, "are rarely so human...so at the mercy of their fears and desires, as when they are confronting the limits of knowledge."</p>
<p>This is the secret fear that Horgan pursues throughout this remarkable book: Have the big questions all been answered? Has all the knowledge worth pursuing become known? Will there be a final "theory of everything" that signals the end? Is the age of great discoveries behind us? Is science today reduced to mere puzzle solving and adding details to existing theories?</p>
<p>Horgan extracts surprisingly candid answers to these and other delicate questions as he discusses God, Star Trek, superstrings, quarks, plectics, consciousness, Neural Darwinism, Marx's view of progress, Kuhn's view of revolutions, cellular automata, robots, and the Omega Point, with Fred Hoyle, Noam Chomsky, John Wheeler, Clifford Geertz, and dozens of other eminent scholars. The resulting narrative will both infuriate and delight as it mingles Horgan's smart, contrarian argument for "endism" with a witty, thoughtful, even profound overview of the entire scientific enterprise.</p>
<p>Scientists have always set themselves apart from other scholars in the belief that they do not construct the truth, they discover it. Their work is not interpretation but simple revelation of what exists in the empirical universe. But science itself keeps imposing limits on its own power. Special relativity prohibits the transmission of matter or information at speeds faster than that of light; quantum mechanics dictates uncertainty; and chaos theory confirms the impossibility of complete prediction. Meanwhile, the very idea of scientific rationality is under fire from NeoLuddites, animal-rights activists, religious fundamentalists, and New Agers alike.</p>
<p>As Horgan makes clear, perhaps the greatest threat to science may come from losing its special place in the hierarchy of disciplines, being reduced to something more akin to literary criticism as more and more theoreticians engage in the theory twiddling he calls "ironic science." Still, while Horgan offers his critique, grounded in the thinking of the world's leading researchers, he offers homage, too. If science is ending, he maintains, it is only because it has done its work so well. </p>

</i>
<p>BLAME Mary Shelley. When her anti-hero, Victor Frankenstein, meddled with forces he did not understand, she gave voice to the impulse to question science. The monster has been on the loose ever since. In these two books science-doubt strays into the establishment. John Horgan, a journalist with <i>Scientific American</i>, argues that science's great age is done and that there is much that mankind will never understand. Edward Tenner, who edited scientific books at Princeton University Press, catalogues technology's perverse, frustrating consequences. Neither book quite rings true.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The idea that today's theories might not be surpassed is tempting, especially to scientists. In the breathless words of Richard Feynman, a Nobel-prizewinning physicist, "We are very lucky to be living in an age in which we are still making discoveries. It is like...America--you only discover it once." In many areas of science Mr Horgan thinks that the Jamestown settlers have landed. Biology rests on Darwin and on modern genetics; cosmology has the big bang; physics has quantum mechanics and the standard model describing the structure of matter. In other areas--defining consciousness or unifying the social sciences, the author doubts whether voyagers will ever strike land.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is left? Mr Horgan, borrowing a term from literary theory, suggests "ironic" science: learned, but untestable speculation on the significance and interconnections of established theories. Edward Witten, a physicist at Princeton, dreams of superstrings, which are unimaginably tiny loops of energy in many dimensions. Stephen Hawking, a British cosmologist, contemplates wormholes linking distant regions of space-time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet science is not just grand theory. "Mere problem-solving", as the book dismissively calls it, is how most scientists spend most of their time. Moreover, the difference between "ironic" science and "real" science does not stand up. What was Newton doing when he speculated on the structure of matter? What about Kepler's belief in the celestial music of the spheres? The "ironies" of past scientists have either been forgotten or transmuted into straightforward modern theory.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The real weakness of Mr Horgan's claim is that it is itself untestable. Successful theories are, by definition, good at explaining what people currently think needs explaining. Inadequacies show up later, as new facts are learned and old ones take on new significance. The late 20th century may be the last age of grand theory. Then again, it may not be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though packaged as science-doubt, "Why Things Bite Back" underlines just how much everyday science is still to be done. It is a catalogue of unintended consequences: medicine has helped cure acute illness and injury, but chronic diseases are commoner as a result; miracle crops and new animals let loose in strange habitats have run wild; forest fires have been prevented, but the unburned growth that collects makes fires worse when they do occur; safer cars and sports equipment makes people more reckless, and so on.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True or plausible those claims may be, but they do not add up to a new or startling message. Too many of Mr Tenner's examples are familiar and who, after <font size=-1>DDT</font> or mad-cow disease, seriously thinks that technology does only good? Despite its critical tone, this book lacks the passion of an all-or-nothing polemic. Mr Tenner is simply too sensible to dismiss science and technology out of hand, acknowledging that on balance they leave most people better off. When things do go wrong, his answer is not Luddism but greater vigilance and better technology. "Try again, Frankenstein," Mr Tenner seems to be saying, "only this time get it right."

The End of Progress
<p>In 1989, just a month after my meeting with Roger Penrose in Syracuse, Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota held a symposium with the provocative but misleading title, "The End of Science?" The meeting's premise was that belief in science-- rather than science itself-- was coming to an end. As one organizer put it, "There is an increasing feeling that science as a unified, universal, objective endeavor is over." Most of the speakers were philosophers who had challenged the authority of science in one way or another. The meeting's great irony was that one of the scientists who spoke, Gunther Stent, a biologist at the University of California at Berkeley, had for years promulgated a much more dramatic scenario than the one posited by the symposium. Stent had asserted that science itself might be ending, and not because of the skepticism of a few academic sophists. Quite the contrary. Science might be ending because it worked so well.</p>
<p>Stent is hardly a fringe figure. He was a pioneer of molecular biology; he founded the first department dedicated to that field at Berkeley in the 1950s and performed experiments that helped to illuminate the machinery of genetic transmission. Later, after switching from genetics to the study of the brain, he was named chairman of the neurobiology department of the National Academy of Sciences. Stent is also the most astute analyst of the limits of science whom I have encountered (and by astute I mean of course that he articulates my own inchoate premonitions). In the late 1960s, while Berkeley was racked with student protests, he wrote an astonishingly prescient book now long out of print, called The Coming of the Golden Age: A View of the End of Progress. Published in 1969, it contended that science--as well as technology, the arts, and all progressive, cumulative enterprises--was coming to an end.</p>
<p>Most people, Stent acknowledged, consider the notion that science might soon cease to be absurd. How can science possibly be nearing an end when it has been advancing so rapidly throughout this century? Stent turned this inductive argument on its head. Initially, he granted, science advances exponentially through a positive feedback effect; knowledge begets more knowledge, and power begets more power. Stent credited the American historian Henry Adams with having foreseen this aspect of science at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Adams's law of acceleration, Stent pointed out, has an interesting corollary. If there are any limits to science, any barriers to further progress, then science may well be moving at unprecedented speed just before it crashes into them. When science seems most muscular, triumphant, potent, that may be when it is nearest death. "Indeed, the dizzy rate at which progress is now proceeding," Stent wrote in Golden Age, "makes it seem very likely that progress must come to a stop soon, perhaps in our lifetime, perhaps in a generation or two." </p>

Ever Since Frankenstein
<p>ONE OF INDUSTRIAL and postindustrial humanity's perennial nightmares is the machine that passes from stubbornness to rebellion. As Rod Serling's 1961 short story "A Thing About Machines" begins, a fastidious, acerbic food writer named Bartlet Finchley is insulting a long-suffering television repairman. The man is fixing a set that Finchley pummeled after it failed to "work properly." Finchley mishandles the devices around him with the same malice he shows toward people. When his departing secretary wishes him defeat in "this mortal combat between you and the appliances," his electric typewriter begins spontaneously to produce the words "Get out of here, Finchley." A Mexican dancer looks straight at him out of a television program, repeating the message. Soon a mechanical mutiny erupts. His electric razor nearly mauls his face. The chimes of his clock ring uncontrollably. His car slips its emergency brake and rolls down the driveway, almost striking a child on a bicycle.</p>
<p>After the police come and go, the appliances drive Finchley from the house. The car--forerunner of Stephen King's Christine--accelerates spontaneously, pursuing him around the neighborhood. Forced into his own swimming pool, he drowns as the engine seems to "let out a deep roar like some triumphant shout." The story ends with a cemetery caretaker puzzling over why his power lawn mower has tugged him off its path to strike Finchley's tombstone. The machines have retaliated where the stoic human victims of Finchley's corrosive wit had simply thrown up their hands.</p>
<p>Finchley's nemesis was technological vengeance, American style. His
namesake the ill-fated early do-it-yourselfer Lord Finchley in Hilaire Belloc's
verse, is electrocuted after breaching noblesse oblige by rummaging around in
his fusebox rather than defer to a tradesman:
<ul> Lord Finchley tried to mend the Electric Light Himself. It struck him dead: And serve him right! It is the business of the wealthy man To give employment to the artisan.</ul></p>
<p>Bartlett Finchley, who does hire people but insults them, dies to atone for his affronts to machines. The human beings in the story are too polite or too afraid of his acid tongue to retaliate. Not so the objects.</p>
<p>Serling was mocking not technology but sarcasm and arrogance. Yet he was also tapping into the misgivings of industrial society, doubts that have grown recently to proportions even greater than those of the 1960s. What if Serling had lived to the 1990s to present Mr. Finchley in a "smart" house? With heating, cooling, timekeeping, security, television, and telephone coordinated by a master computer, Finchley's aggrieved machines could have choreographed their retaliation under the diabolical intelligence of a central processing unit. Serling recognized that, without being Finchleys, we all have at times "a thing about machines." </p>

Why do new roads lead to bigger traffic jams? Why after all the advances made
in medicine are there deadlier diseases around than ever? Why are labour
saving devices destroying our dreams of the leisured society? Why does every
major technological advance lead to paradoxical, unforeseen and unintended
consequences? It seems as if the world we have created is intent on getting
even. Things bite back.
<p>In this ground-breaking study, Edward Tenner--who has taught at Princeton and conducted research at the Institute for Advanced Study--shows that with every great advance there is a corresponding revenge effect: pest-control which spreads pests, exercise which diminished fitness, communication which impedes the flow of information. The asbestos curtain which once offered protection from one hazard now itself represents a long-term chronic problem. As we complicate the systems which govern our lives, revenge effects multiply.</p>
<p>Technology demands more, not less, human work to function. Technology has increased the need for vigilance not reduced it. For every acute problem solved, a chronic problem comes up in its stead.</p>
<p>Why Things Bite Back, carefully and extensively documented, brings together themes and material from widely differing disciplines (epidemiology, ecology, social psychology, traffic engineering, organisational behaviour). It offers a template from problem solving across the board--whether in business management, agriculture or for coping, indeed, with the general stress of living in the technological world. Like Charles Handy's Age of Unreason or Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man, Edward Tenner's Why Things Bite Back is a book to change forever the way we think about the modern world and our place in it. </p>

<p><b>Terraforming gardens...</b></p>
<h2>Click and clip</h2><ul> <li>P<font size=-1>ERFECT</font> P<font size=-1>LANTS</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Roger Phillips and Martyn Rix.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Macmillan; &#163;39.99 for </i><font size=-1>CD-ROM</font><i>; &#163;12.99 for book.</i><font size=-1> CD-ROM</font> <i>distributed in America by Maxis $39.99; book published by Random House $23</i> <br>
</ul>

<p>IF PLANTING a garden involved no more than finding the right subjects for particular locations, a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> would be an ideal tool. Users can scroll quickly through a wide range of plants, calling up for each an informative photograph and text that gives details of its cultivation, care and favoured growing conditions. Those who seek a plant for a chosen spot, of a particular height, colour and growing habit, enter their criteria and the disc will produce a short list to choose from. In essence, a good <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> is a quick and convenient tool for deciding what to grow, handier to use than a reference book and easier to manipulate than a television gardening programme.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Using "Perfect Plants" is a bit like visiting a garden centre without leaving your desk. When, having browsed among more than 2<i>,</i>000 plants, you find some that you might want to buy, you transfer them to an electronic "shopping cart" for later review. Window-shopping this way can be easier than the real thing. You can search, for example, for shrubs that tolerate shade and cold winters, and that were introduced in the 18th century, if your garden is historically correct. These devices are practical and work well. Text is admirably clear and more comprehensive than in the printed version. The photographs, too, look much more handsome on screen than in their necessarily reduced size in the book.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To appeal to <font size=-1>PC</font>-users who are not gardening professionals, publishers feel they need to offer glitzy extras, including customised background music, in the hope that this will make the device an irresistible joy to use and convince customers that it is worth the money. In "Perfect Plants", some of these add-ons work well. Most centre around Roger Phillips, a veteran garden writer and <font size=-1>TV</font> presenter, whose cheerful voice, exuding enthusiasm and lightly-worn expertise, accompanies short video clips. His presence gives an authorial identity that some discs lack.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The section on plant care works well. In 35 half-minute clips, Mr Phillips gives tips on pruning, planting, propagating and much else. The advice is clear and, of necessity, concise. After a couple of viewings of the clip on pruning clematis, even a novice would be confident about wielding the secateurs without doing mortal damage to the plant. Clearly you cannot take a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> with you into the garden as you are actually doing the work, but this is not a serious objection: it is, after all, rare to see gardeners perusing books as they work. There are, as well, six garden tours, each offering a 90-second gallop around a particular kind of garden (four in America, two in Britain), though these clips are too short to be useful. The disc's biggest failing may be inherent in the technology: an absence of depth and discursiveness. It can tell you what flower to grow in what conditions, but not why you should want to. Roses, for instance, arouse conflicting passions that are unreflected here. "Perfect Plants" takes you through scores of varieties without addressing the question of whether you should be looking for a hybrid tea, with its showy bloom but ungainly habit, or a less assertive shrub rose, which has a more manageable overall shape. And to cover your wall, would a climber or a rambler be best, and what is the difference between them? And why do you want to grow roses anyway? On those points, this disc is silent.

<h2>The multimedia wipeout</h2>

<p><b>Why are CD-ROMs such bad business?</b></p><ul></ul>

<p>WHEN "A Brief History of Time", a rather hard-going science book from a little-known boffin, unexpectedly sold more than 5.5m copies in the early 1990s, publishers scoured the planet for science writers who could repeat the success. They failed--nobody could quite work out why the book had done so well, but it was pretty clear that book-buyers were not keen to have another baffling tome gathering dust on their coffee tables.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This was a lesson multimedia publishers might have remembered when a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> called "Myst" from a little-known software firm sold 2m copies after its release in 1993. Again, nobody quite knew why it had been such a success--publishers of "Myst" had expected to sell only 80,000 copies. But the triumph was enough for dozens of companies to declare that the multimedia <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> age had arrived, and invest heavily in a race for the next "Myst".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today, most of those companies are a bit wiser and a lot poorer. Multimedia <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s have failed even to match the success of Nintendo's simple video-game machines. Overall, they sell pretty well--more than $1 billion last year, worldwide--but most of the companies that make them are losing money at it. In the past six months alone, three leading <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> publishers--Sierra On-Line, The Learning Company and Davidson--have been bought up in an industry consolidation. Other media giants, from Time-Warner to Hearst and Turner Broadcasting, largely left the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> market after disappointing sales. Dozens of smaller firms have gone under.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By rights, <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s should be a great business. There are some 20m multimedia <font size=-1>PC</font>s in the world, a total that will probably jump by 50% this year, and it seems a fair assumption that anybody who can afford a $2,000 computer will be willing to part with a few dollars for the software to make it sing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reality is harsher. The average multimedia <font size=-1>PC</font> owner buys less than one <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s a year--disappointing parsimony when measured against the more than 2,700 <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> titles that the industry released last year, each costing anything from several hundred thousand dollars to $10m to produce. A <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> fetches on average less than $10 today, a low figure that reflects the high volume of free or discounted <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s in the marketplace. Of that $10, the publisher and the developer together make about $2, after the distributor, retailer and others take their cut. At that rate, a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> that costs $1m to make--the average for entertainment titles is $1.5m, according to Dataquest, a consultancy--would have to sell at least 500,000 copies to break even. More than 100 such titles were released last year, yet fewer than 20 passed that sales target.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One explanation for these bleak figures is that most <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s are rubbish. For all their video and sound, few are more entertaining than the Pac Man video game of a decade ago. The transition from floppy discs to <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s increased the data-holding capacity of a disc nearly 400 times, but it did not increase the stock of creativity and good ideas in the world. To make matters worse, some of the better <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s are very expensive: the top games sell for an average of about $40 each. Multimedia developers blame the medium itself. <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s may seem to have a huge capacity--almost 600m bytes of information--but high-quality video can eat that up in about ten minutes. A new disc standard known as <font size=-1>DVD</font> with much more capacity is in the works, but that will take years to win acceptance. (<font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s took nearly a decade to reach even today's popularity.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, it seems likely that by the time the <font size=-1>DVD</font> standard catches on, many of us will not be looking to discs at all for our entertainment. The greatest competition <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s now face is from entertainment and information features on the Internet, where there are essentially no space restrictions at all and everything is just a mouse-click or two away. This is why many analysts treat <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s as an interim technology, to be overtaken in time by the near limitless capacity and variety of computer networks. But that could take years. For now, most multimedia customers face <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s or nothing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is not necessarily a bad thing. Some <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s are worth their price, if you can find them. Most are sold in software shops, which have limited shelf space--often enough to hold just a hundred or so titles, less than 1% of those available. Predictably, the space goes first to the biggest brands--the Microsofts, Broderbunds and Mindscapes. The small publishers, which often have the most creative titles, are least likely to find a spot. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most shelf space, in any event, goes to cardboard. Because <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s are tricky to sample (shops try to avoid demonstration computers, which customers seem to crash with alarming regularity), <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> publishers use big boxes (mostly full of air) to show off a disc's charms. Add promotional gimmicks, such as plastic flying saucers, and shops are lucky if they can squeeze a few dozen titles on a wall. A bright-sounding idea to deal with this distribution bottleneck--persuading <font size=-1>PC</font>- makers to "bundle" their software free with new computers--boomeranged as consumers got the impression that <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s were give-aways.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Publishers are now backing away from bundling, and desperately hunting for some other way to make multimedia publishing a profitable business. Some are drawing a lesson from the Internet's success and offering "hybrid" <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s that combine multimedia on disc with updates and interactivity online. Publishers are also offering more for the money. Making a sellable <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> nowadays can take Hollywood-standard production. "Wing Commander IV", a game released earlier this year, cost $10m to make and stars Malcolm McDowell.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Hollywood analogy may go further. More and more the multimedia industry fits the Hollywood business model, where a few hits support a lot of misses. Hence the consolidations: only big companies can afford the losses. Small firms with the big ideas are finding it ever harder to survive. For them, the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> business is becoming a choice between three destinations: consolidation, the net or the bankruptcy courts.

<p><b>Britain's monarchy</b></p>
<h2>Making it up</h2><ul> <li><a href="11ex336.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> Q<font size=-1>UEEN</a>:</font> A B<font size=-1>IOGRAPHY</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> E<font size=-1>LIZABETH</font> II.&nbsp;  By Ben Pimlott. <br>
</ul>

<p>THE most important long-term decisions are sometimes taken by people who have no idea what they are doing. Ben Pimlott, in his excellent biography of Queen Elizabeth, gives the impression that the British monarchy is in such desperate trouble today because the queen and her courtiers a generation ago failed to take heed for the future. They were inexorably moving into an impasse--but did not know it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The queen inherited her conception of the monarchy from her father and grandfather. Ascending the throne at the age of 25, she had no ideas of her own. All she knew for sure was that she had to do her duty, and her duty consisted of marrying well, producing heirs, travelling widely in the Commonwealth, presiding over large numbers of ceremonial functions, reading the state papers that were set before her and keeping well out of party politics. Her duty also consisted of maintaining her own dignity and that of her family.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Maintaining her dignity in practice meant social detachment as well as personal remoteness. She came from the British aristocracy. Her friends were all from that closed circle, and she shared both their interests--horses, dogs and shooting--and their lack of interests--books, big ideas and high culture in any form. After a few exciting forays into the outside world as a teenager, she sought the company only of people like herself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, her temperament was as conservative as her surroundings. Her political views were mildly liberal--in the "One Nation" Tory manner--but socially and in her work habits she became set in her ways early in her reign and has remained so ever since. As Mr Pimlott says, she was against innovation: "Tradition, the rhythm of the royal seasons, doing things the way they had always been done, were her best comfort."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They were also her undoing. They led to sleepwalking, when the monarchy's future--her family's if not her own--depended on lynx-eyed alertness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Mr Pimlott shows, the monarchy during most of the present century rested on three supports: the British people's deference to their social superiors; the press's extreme reluctance to intrude too far into the royal family's private affairs; and the fact that--miracle of miracles--most of the royals, with the embarrassing exception of Edward VIII, who insisted on marrying an American divorc&#233;e, led unexceptional personal lives. What the queen seems not to have taken into account was the possibility, indeed the probability, that sooner or later all three supports would crumble.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though no one knew it at the time, the turning point came in the late 1960s. The queen and her advisers took it for granted that they could carry on much as before: rich, remote, socially aloof, moral exemplars to the nation. But simultaneously they decided to prove that the royal family was human--and also to court short-term popularity--by encouraging the <font size=-1>BBC</font> to transmit an extended documentary showing intimate details of the royals at work and play. That did it. Fully two-thirds of the population watched. Private lives became public. The mystery of royalty became mere glamour. "It was difficult", Mr Pimlott remarks drily, "once the genie of this kind of publicity had been let out of the bottle, to put it back in."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The publicity-unleashing documentary resulted from a tactical decision. What was lacking was a thought-through strategy. An old-fashioned, George VI-like monarchy might still have been possible, just, but only if the queen, her husband and all four children had been ready to lead blameless lives and avoid all controversy. Failing that--and the odds against such stringent conditions being fulfilled were enormous--the only option was to scale the monarchy down radically, with the royals not only paying taxes but taking jobs, giving interviews and--who knows?--perhaps even sending their children to state schools. As it was, the royals insisted on trying to remain on their pedestal and were knocked off.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Pimlott's biography of the queen is first-class history: well researched, well informed and gently ironic. He offers, instead of revelations, a balanced portrait of one person doing one job at one time. Junior members of the royal family should read it with care. All the signs are that--despite much thrashing about--they have still not decided what they want the future shape of the monarchy to be. If they do not decide wisely and soon, it may not have one.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
APRIL 1926 was a busy month for every member of the Conservative Government, but for few
ministers more than the Home Secretary, Sir William Joynson-Hicks. A long, bitter dispute in the
coalfields was moving rapidly towards its climax - with drastic implications for the nation.
<p>'We are going to be slaves no longer and our men will starve before they accept any reductions in wages,' the miners' leader, A. J. Cook, had declared in an angry speech that crystallized the mood in the collieries, while the men resolved: 'Not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day'. On 14 April, the TUC leadership asked the Prime Minister to intervene. A week later the owners and men met, but failed to reach agreement. Thereafter, the chance of a compromise diminished, and the prospect grew closer of a terrifying industrial shutdown which - for the first time in British history - seemed likely to affect the majority of British manual workers. Alarm affected all levels of society. Even King George V - mindful of his right to be consulted, and his duty both to encourage and above all to warn - discreetly urged his ministers to show caution. Alas, royal counsels were in vain, and the General Strike began at midnight on 3rd May 1926, threatening not just economic paralysis and bankruptcy, but the constitution itself.</p>
<p>'Jix' Joynson-Hicks - best known to history for his zeal in ordering police raids on the decadent writings of D.H. Lawrence and Radclyffe Hall, and for the part he later played in defeating the 1927 Bill to revise the Prayer Book- was scarcely an outstanding or memorable holder of his post. This, however, was his most splendid hour. In swashbuckling alliance with Winston Churchill, Neville Chamberlain, Quintin Hogg and Leo Amery, the Home Secretary was a Cabinet hawk, in the thick of the fight, a scourge of the miners, opposed to an easy settlement. </p>

<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
The fifth longest reigning Monarch in British history has been one of the most famous people in the
world all her life. Yet she remains an enigma.
<p>What kind of person is she? What does she stand for? How has she adapted, if at all? How has she coped with problems that threaten the survival of the Monarchy itself? What does the British obsession with the Royal Family tell us about ourselves? In this unusual book, Ben Pimlott (described by Andrew Marr in the Independent as 'the best British political biographer now writing') tackles these questions by examining the life of Elizabeth II--individual, institution and icon--in detail.</p>
<p>Using a range of new sources, including papers from the Royal Archives, diaries, letters and interviews, he treats his subject with the detachment and rigour he has applied to leading politicians. He tells the compelling tale of a life uniquely placed at the centre of the national stage since childhood, and of the ever-changing way it has been perceived. He examines the social, political and psychological influences that formed the Queen. He looks at the ideas she represents, and at the pervasive impact of the strange phenomenon of Monarchy.</p>
<p>A story unfolds of the evolving 'family on the throne,' form the year of the General Strike to the age of Fergie and Di--and of the part it plays in the British Constitution, the Commonwealth and the world's imagination.</p>
<p>Scholarly, provocative, and often entertaining, The Queen is a vitally important book for all who car about public life in Britain--past, present and to come. </p>

<p>THOUGH not the longest river in North America, the Columbia is by far the most powerful. Draining an area larger than the eastern seaboard from Maine to Virginia, it falls nearly twice as far as the storied Mississippi in only half the distance. On its tumbling course it releases the energy of the Hiroshima bomb every half hour and provides a third of America's hydroelectric power. It is, or was, the world's greatest salmon hatchery, producing billions of salmon fry each year, hardy millions of which returned upstream against its cold, fast currents.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Untrammelled power was what struck the explorers Lewis and Clark when they paddled their canoes down the river's foaming rapids in 1805. Today, writes Blaine Harden, it is a different waterway, hardly worthy of the name "river", and he calls it instead a "managed pool". Sixteen dams on the Columbia and the Snake, its main tributary, control about every drop of water that flows from the Cascade Mountains into the vast Columbia Basin. So complete is human domination of the Columbia that it can be scheduled like a haircut for speedboat races, where 150-mph boats require slack water and precise depths.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the river's flow has gone its salmon. Once counted in the millions, they now return by the hundreds--if at all. Many are barred from their spawning grounds by dams built without fish ladders; others lay eggs only to have the fry killed by spinning turbines and unnaturally warm waters as they try to reach the Pacific. Of the 400 native fish species formerly found in the Columbia, one-quarter are extinct and more than half are at risk of the same fate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In place of the salmon and the once-wild river, Mr Harden writes, has come a wave of farmers, barge owners and electricity customers. They see the river's cheap power and irrigation water as almost a customary right and balk at any suggestion that they might help pay the costs that controlling the Columbia have imposed on the region. To educate them, Mr Harden tallies that cost: diminished salmon runs; scattered Indian tribes who built a culture around salmon and now eat canned salmon provided by the government; millions of tax dollars spent on subsidised irrigation and power generation; and the creation of what may be the most polluted hazardous waste-site on the planet at Hanford, Washington, which was built in part because of its nearness to plentiful hydroelectric power.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although his subject is a river, Mr Harden's prism is those who work on and around it. Through his eyes you meet what seem like an unending parade of vain, greedy, wilfully ignorant individuals, many of whom say they never realised salmon swam in the Columbia or that their dam-formed lakes swamped a way of life that had existed for thousands of years. Instead, an engineer who designed dams insists they actually helped salmon when all the evidence shows the opposite. A farmer has no qualms about using (or selling at a profit) irrigation water that has cost taxpayers $2.1m in all for a 960-acre (390-hectare) farm. To barge operators it is not odd to make a town 200 miles inland a seaport.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Harden is not easy on these people. Rather than proud and independent empire-builders, they are, he says, "deadbeat debtors, unable to pay the bills they have run up, unwilling to acknowledge that debts even exist". But Mr Harden is equally tough on a newer generation: those "suburbanites with money and education and subscriptions to <i>Audubon</i> magazine" who would like the salmon saved because it sounds nice (despite billions in cost) or who want the Columbia reserved as a windsurfing playground.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why this ambivalence? Mr Harden, who has covered civil wars for the <i>Washington Post </i>from Africa and Yugoslavia, understands complexities. He knows, too, that reporters cannot wholly take themselves out of a story. Mr Harden benefited from the Columbia's destruction. During the 1930s depression his father helped build the huge Grand Coulee Dam. The savings put young Blaine through private college in eastern Washington and graduate school on the East Coast.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite this fine book's title, Mr Harden draws few firm conclusions. A returning native son, he writes less as judge or policy analyst than as a melancholy chronicler. "A River Lost" records in fascinating detail how the well-being of those who live off the Columbia's largesse was purchased with billions of federal dollars and how one of the West's most majestic rivers was sacrificed to economic advance.

<p><b>Practical economics</b></p>
<h2>Money making</h2><ul> <li><a href="11ex347.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> B<font size=-1>USINESS</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> E<font size=-1>CONOMICS</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By John Kay. <br>
</ul>



<p>"IF YOU'RE so smart, why aren't you rich?" This is a fair question to ask people selling financial advice, says John Kay in explaining how economics can be used to analyse business problems. It is a fair question to put to economists too: if they know so much about businesses and markets, why aren't they coining it?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The question would not stymie Mr Kay, who has achieved success both as an academic and as a businessman. He has long been a professor at the London Business School and has recently (too recently for the dust jacket of this collection of essays) been appointed director of Oxford University's new business school. To take up this post, he is relinquishing the chairmanship of London Economics, his successful economic consultancy firm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The Business of Economics" contains 20 essays by Mr Kay that have appeared in newspapers and academic journals. Some of these are excellent. Mr Kay has a gift, rare among academic economists, for explaining how economics can be put to practical use. He points out that most economists are not, as people seem to believe, preoccupied by making inaccurate predictions about growth rates, inflation and unemployment. The majority specialise instead in microeconomics: the analysis of industries and markets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best of his essays apply microeconomic analysis to everyday questions in a lucid and entertaining way. Why, for instance, is there never a shortage of taxis at Heathrow airport? Because the government sets fares too high, giving cab drivers an incentive to queue while passengers find other means of transport. Will technological advance mean that markets for audio-visual media come to be dominated by a few giants? Stop worrying, says Mr Kay. It is unlikely that anybody will have a monopoly of talent, publishing or distribution; a fragmented industry of large firms and small is more likely.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other articles examine what makes companies successful. Mr Kay argues that too many managers get carried away with a "vision" of their firm: as a result they think too little about its particular strengths and weaknesses, or about the nature of its markets. A favourite example is the misconceived attempt in the 1980s by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, a British advertising company, to expand into a global advertising business by buying rival firms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, Mr Kay's least satisfactory arguments are those that will get the most attention, at least in Britain. He is a proponent of the "stakeholder" approach to capitalism, and he is seen as something of a hero by Tony Blair's New Labour and something of a villain by right-wingers. He does not believe that the purpose of companies is to maximise profits for their shareholders. They are not, he argues, owned by shareholders in any meaningful sense but are "social institutions". Shareholders are just one of several groups of stakeholders with claims on the firms. Others include customers, employees, suppliers and so on.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is either trivial or meaningless. Few companies, bar perhaps monopoly utilities, can afford to have a miserable workforce or disgruntled customers. If, that is, they want to be successful. Presumably, that means making money for their shareholders.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Economics and Business
<p>Chapter 1 was written for the centenary issue of the Economic Journal. Its purpose was to explain why economics had so little impact on business, and what should be done about it.</p>
<p>The article is the only one in this book which was addressed exclusively to professional economists, and its style to some extent reflects that. But I have nevertheless chosen to place it first because its arguments are central to everything that follows. Economics is not about forecasting, and economists should not be judged by the accuracy of their forecasts. The economics which is principally relevant to business is the economics which deals with firms and with markets, not the economics which tries to tell politicians whether interest rates go up or down. Most people in business have little knowledge that the former economics even exists. This chapter outlines its scope.</p>
<p>If you ask most business executives what they think economics is about, their answer will be economic forecasting. They do not think very much of economic forecasting--although they go on thinking they need it--and so they do not think very much of economists. Every day they are concerned to analyse their costs--which is done by their accountants. They determine their prices--this is the responsibility of their marketing department. They need to interpret the business environment they face--the task of their corporate planners and strategic advisers. The economic input into any of these functions is minimal.</p>
<p>Yet costs, prices, industries, and markets are the very lifeblood of microeconomics, just as inflation, output, and growth are the lifeblood of macroeconomics. Economics dominates public policy and every country's chief executive regards his (or her) macroeconomic adviser as a vital aide. But economics has almost no influence on business policy, and in only a small </p>

<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
John Kay has been described as the 'best management theorist in Britain bar none', and this book shows
why.
<p>Here he combines common sense and rigorous economic thinking in a number of essays on business and economic issues--the competitiveness of UK plc, the stakeholder economy, business strategy, and corporate personality etc.</p>
<p>Kay is well known for his incisive and entertaining columns in the Financial Times (some of which are included here), his regular radio and TV broadcasts, and is much in demand as a speaker and consultant. In The Business of Economics he shares his analysis, thoughts and insights on a range of urgent and important issues facing the country and individual firms. His clear and direct writing style will inform, challenge, and entertain; his rigorous and clever analysis of the corporate world will offer insights into the business problems and decisions faced by executives and managers every day.</p>
<p>Kay's overall purpose is to show that economics can and should be brought to the analysis of business problems. In doing so he distinguishes his approach from that of the forecasters and the formula- bound, and those on the other hand who suggest abandoning economics in our postmodern complex world.</p>
<p>This book confirms the judgement of The Economist that 'Kay is well on the way to turning himself into a European Michael Porter.' </p>

<p><b>Subsidising scientific research</b></p>
<h2>Down the test tubes</h2><ul> <li>T<font size=-1>HE</font> E<font size=-1>CONOMIC</font> L<font size=-1>AWS</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> S<font size=-1>CIENTIFIC</font> R<font size=-1>ESEARCH</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Terence Kealey.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Macmillan; 384 pages; &#163;45</i> <br>
</ul>

<p>SOMETIMES the only way to convey the flavour of a banquet is to let people sample the grub themselves. Sink your teeth into the following typical morsel, footnotes and all, from a chapter entitled "Dr Pangloss was Right", in Terence Kealey's astonishing book:

<ul><font size=-1>What are the most important determinants of technological development? Are they the so-called supply factors of new science and new discoveries such as thinkers like Musson and Robinson,</font><font size=-2>47</font> Parker,<font size=-2>48</font> Rostow<font size=-2>49</font> or Rosenberg<font size=-2>50</font> believe, or are they the so-called demand factors of the search for greater profits as Marx, Schmookler<font size=-2>51</font> and Zevin<font size=-2>52</font> believe? It does not matter, as under <i>laissez faire</i> both needs are met. Is technological development largely a matter of giant leaps forward as Schumpeter<font size=-2>53</font> or Kuznets<font size=-2>54</font> believed, or does it emerge from the cumulative, anonymous, accretion of thousands of small improvements as Usher,<font size=-2>55</font> Gilfillan,<font size=-2>56</font>Landes,<font size=-2>57</font> Fishlow,<font size=-2>58</font> Hollander,<font size=-2>59</font> Hall<font size=-2>60</font> and Enos<font size=-2>61</font> believe? It does not matter, <i>laissez faire</i> meets both ends.</font></ul>


Reader, take <i>The Economist</i>'s word that it matters not a whit whether you have ever before heard of Gilfillan, Schmookler or Enos; nor whether you are a partisan of Kuznets or a critic of Landes; nor even whether you are allergic to footnotes. Mr Kealey, a teacher of biochemistry at Cambridge University, has produced one of the most appetising and sustained polemics ever concocted on a serious topic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As it happens, the author's single-minded aim is to persuade you that the public funding of science and technology is not only unnecessary but also counter-productive. But you will enjoy this book even if the proper funding of science is a matter of utter indifference to you. For in following the argument you will discover along the way why it was the barbarians who invented soap and the stirrup (and why the Romans did not); what happened after Francis Bacon stuffed a chicken's carcass with snow at the foot of Highgate hill (and why the wretched man deserved his horrible fate); and what the fact that Marx abandoned the illegitimate child he sired through his wife's maid tells you about the public funding of universities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What, though, if you do care about the proper funding of science? This book is thoroughly iconoclastic. Mr Kealey refuses to buy the argument that one thing the state really does need to pay for is science and technology, and that by doing so it can boost economic growth. This, he argues, is an illusion fostered by Bacon, who got technology quite the wrong way around, and which has been sustained ever since by people with a vested interest in receiving state handouts. In practice, he says, technology arises from trial and error by practical people going about their business, and the speed of discovery is determined largely by the extent of economic freedom.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To prove his case, Mr Kealey deploys a prodigious erudition. He reviews antiquity, and discovers that "plunder empires" like the Roman one collapsed because they neglected technology, whereas "market empires" thrived. He ridicules the idea that scientific understanding leads to new technology, on the ground that it is almost always the reverse that is true. James Watt's improvement of the steam engine in the industrial revolution owed nothing to Joseph Black's scientific study of latent heat. Farmers bred new strains of animals and crops for millennia before Gregor Mendel systematised the scientific laws that underpinned what they were doing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Mr Kealey's history, it is almost always commerce that comes first, techno logy second and science third. And yet in modern times governments have taken the opposite view, pouring subsidies into universities to fund research that firms would do voluntarily if they could see the way to profit from it. Mr Kealey notes that European governments have lately subsidised dozens of initiatives to help their electronics industry, but that it is the largely unsubsidised American firms that have triumphed. State funding has turned academic science itself into "an artificial, self-referential, government-funded asylum".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a brilliant book, but also an over-stated one, and there is something of the curmudgeon and the martyr in its author's tone. Mr Kealey admits that he has often felt lonely ploughing his <i>laissez-faire</i> furrow and ends by declaring that he has striven to obey Solzhenitsyn's instruction to "pursue the truth regardless of the consequences". One certain consequence is that he will be denounced as a traitor by colleagues in the publicly funded universities whose very reason for being he has called into question. Yet he may also have provided a good reason for maintaining such institutions. Where else can a free spirit afford to bite so hard the hand that feeds it? Certainly not in the <i>laissez-faire</i> world of business.

<h2>What the world is reading</h2>

<p>

Spain's bestseller lists are notably pointy-headed. Compare them with America's. Relatively few Spaniards buy books and those who do have rather literary tastes. Serious novels, including two reviewed above, bulk large on our fiction list from Spain this month--a list that includes essays and reflections or what the French call <i>belles lettres</i> as well as novels proper.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Few writers in Spanish are more bankable than Gabriel Garcia Marquez. His latest ''fiction'', an imaginative account of a real-life kidnapping of nine journalists in his native Colombia in 1990, is top. But Carmen Martin Gaite, one of Spain's own leading novelists, is second with ''Lo Raro es Vivir'' (The strange thing is living), dwelling here, as before, on women's lives. Indeed, apart from Stephen King (America) and Susanna Tamaro (Italy), the rest of the fiction list is also notable for its native provenance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though dying in English, the essay as a form is alive in Spain, even if this sampling has an undertow of cultural pessimism. Jose Saramago's ''Sobre la Ceguera'' (On Blindness) questions the solidity of Western society, Manuel Vincent writes of 1960s dreams gone sour and Vicente Verdu in ''El Planeta Americano'' (The American Planet) calls for resistance to America's cultural imperialism.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The last of these three books is third on the non-fiction list--more evidence that in the Spanish-reading world fiction is not segregated from non-fiction as rigidly as it is elsewhere. To confuse things a bit more, at the top of the non-fiction list is the latest hit by another leading Spanish novelist, Manuel Vazquez Montalban.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A protean author, he writes journalism, thrillers and literary novels. His latest book, ''Un Polaco en el Corte del Rey Juan Carlos" (A Pole at the Court of King Juan Carlos) revives the old device of a <i>faux-naif</i> observing his own country as a foreigner. He has interviewed 30 important people and takes readers into Spain's corridors of power.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Civil war is a bitter but popular theme as three non-fiction bestsellers show. Spaniards at last are writing their own books about their civil war (1936-39). And Jose Antonio Mendiluce, who ran the United Nation's relief effort there, laments western inaction during Yugoslavia's (1991-5).

<p>CIVIL-SERVICE reform is a global business. Consultants, large and small, earn fat fees from advising governments on modernising their bureaucracies, and sometimes on how to clear up the mess left by earlier reformers. The flow of advice was once mainly from rich to poor countries. But in the past decade the industrial countries themselves have been the scene of frantic consultancy activity and another big market has opened up as the former communist states seek (or are offered, unsolicited) guidance on how to create bureaucracies fit for new democrats.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consultants themselves are a pragmatic lot. Academic social scientists are much more disposed to try to develop theories and a language to debate them in. The dozen chapters in this book, based on papers given at an academic conference, include an agreeably learned account of the evolution of government servants since the Middle Ages, an authoritative outline of theoretical and methodological problems, an elegant deconstruction of the clutch of activities commonly labelled "new public management" and a review of the international diffusion of specific reforms during the 1980s and 1990s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, it left this reviewer in an ambivalent frame of mind. It is obviously important for all concerned to be clear about what is being discussed. One basic question, for instance, centres on numbers. How useful is it to compare the size of the "civil service" between countries that legally or technically define the institution in different ways? Are there organisations or activities whose employees are not really part of the civil service at all, even though they are locally classified as civil servants? What about the staff of lighthouses, railways, schools, driving-test depots or the agencies the British call quangos?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More subtly, if it is accepted that civil servants must be distinguished from politicians working in government, on which side of the line do you put political advisers in Britain, political appointees in the United States and personal appointments in Mexico? In what important sense are any of these not civil servants? Do they all fall into the same category?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such questions may seem pedantic, as may the book's definition of civil services as "mediating institutions that mobilise human resources in the service of the affairs of the state in a given territory". (This is not wholly satisfactory: where does it place, for example, the independent non-government organisations that are now put under government contract to provide essential services?) But without an agreed language to describe and compare, descriptions are liable to be unhelpful and comparisons misleading.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the other hand, its academic rigour notwithstanding, this book sharply illustrates the gap that can separate those interested in theory and those concerned with practice. It is hard not to regret that some 150,000 words devoted to the analysis and description of contemporary institutions throw so little light on how the resultant theories might be applied to those institutions.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
INTRODUCTION: CONCEPTUALIZING CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEMS
Hans A. G. M. Bekke, James L. Perry, and Theo A. J. Toonen
<p>Civil service has been part of the day-to-day vocabulary of public affairs for over a hundred years. The term "civil servant" was first used formally by the British in the late eighteenth century to distinguish the civilian from the military personnel of the East India Company (Drewry and Butcher, 1988). In the course of this century, civil service in a British context has come to mean, according to the Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Institutions, "the remunerated personnel, other than those serving in the armed forces, whose functions are to administer policies formulated by or approved by national governments" (Bogdanor, 1987: 104). (Civil service is differentiated from "public service," which also includes civilian personnel working with the armed forces, armed forces personnel serving government in a civilian capacity, the judiciary, employees of local governments and public corporations, school and university teachers, police and other agencies.)</p>
<p>This book seeks to advance the formal study of civil service systems. Since public administration originated as an academic field over a century ago, civil service has been a staple of the discipline. Just as politics is the center of political science and social organization the core of sociology, one could argue that civil service is the center of public administration. Among the analytic units encompassed by public administration, the civil service system is the only one not largely shared with other social sciences (Morgan and Perry, 1988).</p>
<p>One reason for calling for formal study of civil service systems is that bureaucracy, a construct on which comparative scholars have relied for years, has failed to propel comparative administration much beyond its status in the 1960s. Bureaucracy often means different things to different investigators. The title ot an article by Fred W Riggs (as cited in Riggs, 1980), one of the intellectual leacitrs of the comparative administration movement, summarizes the problem: "Bureaucracy is a shifty word." Bureaucracy has been used in the literature of comparative administration to describe a particular organizational unit, an entire adnnirlistrative system, or some combination of the two. Heady (1991), for instance, adopts a structural approach to comparative administration across nation states. However, he limits the definition or bureaucracy to three structural features: hierarchy, specialization, and competence; and he excludes from consideration all but higher civil servants, that is, bureaucrats in top or middle-management roles.</p>
<p>Given the shifting foundations of the bureaucracy construct and the excess meaning it has acquired over the years (Goodsell, 1994), there is a need to develop complementary analytic tools. Although use of the term civil service does have a history, the concept, except, perhaps, in Britain, is not linked to an identifiable theory. This has the advantage that, in principle, it allows us to use the concept in an exploratory and inductive manner so that we can map current developments in different administrative systems and mold and develop the central organizing concept accordingly. </p>

Over the past decade, civil service systems in eastern Europe, Africa, and China have undergone
significant transformation. Even in the United States, civil service has been subjected to successive
waves of reform. But while civil service systems play critical roles throughout the world, our
knowledge about them and the changes they are undergoing is remarkably limited. This book aims to
describe and analyze civil service systems throughout the world, to understand how they function and
how they might best be managed, and to lay the foundation for future theoretical work.
<p>The essays are arranged in five thematic sections. Part One provides a general orientation to issues of theory and methodology. Part two is devoted to an examination of the history and structure of civil service systems. Part three explores contextual characteristics of civil service systems. Part four looks at civil service systems from holistic perspectives. Part five examines change and transformation in civil service systems. The editors' concluding chapter examines common themes and proposes an agenda for future research. </p>

<p><b>A literary life</b></p>
<h2>Blob of mercury</h2><ul><li>F<font size=-1>ORD</font> M<font size=-1>ADOX</font> F<font size=-1>ORD</a>:</font> A D<font size=-1>UAL</font> L<font size=-1>IFE</font>&nbsp; By Max Saunders.<br>
</ul>


<p>IN HIS novels, in his reminiscences, in his dazzling chatter and in his morals and conduct, Ford Madox Ford is like a blob of mercury in the palm of the hand. Glittering, it slips and slides and is never still. But, then, is not mercury a seeming contradiction, a liquid metal? Ford's novels, especially his central masterpiece, "The Good Soldier", certainly suggest that he viewed human character and behaviour like that, as being fluid and perpetually in motion. In doing so, he in effect invites his readers to avoid making any moral judgment. Which, of course, is a way of deflecting judgment from his own shifty conduct.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His great achievement was to realise and present that sense of fluidity and endless motion in his novels. He did so by harnessing his subjective insights to an objective technique of presentation. His latest biographer, Max Saunders, uses the fine phrase "ironic pathos" to describe Ford's approach and treatment in his fiction. Ford, not least because of his knowledge of himself, was obsessed with the ever changing and pathetic patterns of life; but he was able to stand aside from them in his novels and present them objectively, neutrally and ironically. This is where Ford shows that mercury is a metal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He did so, spasmodically, elsewhere. He helped to sustain Joseph Conrad at a crucial stage in Conrad's creative development. He was a perceptive literary critic, actively encouraging the <i>avant-garde</i> movement in literature without becoming a member of it. As an editor he recognised and fostered the talents of Ezra Pound, D.H. Lawrence and later Ernest Hemingway. The quality of the two literary reviews he edited was outstanding. But they were short-lived. They brought nothing but financial calamity to Ford's backers, dissolving in acrimony, with Ford, true to himself, sidling away from responsibility. It is not just that Ford was unreliable. He was, like mercury, essentially slippery.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That much is plain in his continual retelling and remoulding of anecdotes about himself, both in speech and in prose. He was, as he put it, giving an "impression" of the events. Conscience did not guide Ford's consciousness. Promiscuous by nature, he satisfied his own appetite, constantly falling in and out of friendship and love. Polygamous is perhaps a fairer word than promiscuous to describe his attitude towards women. He needed them. But at heart, one suspects, he despised them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So slippery a man as Ford presents a problem to any biographer. Which version of what Ford said happened, did happen? Or, even more to the point, did it happen at all? Sometimes there is only Ford's word to say that it did--and that word is, to put it mildly, elusive. Five years ago, Alan Judd adroitly and successfully skirted round the difficulty by following Ford's own method and presenting an "impression" of the man. Not unkindly one hopes, Mr Saunders describes Mr Judd's biography as "novelistic". It is not a path that Mr Saunders, a literary academic, can or cares to follow. Rather, as literary biographer, he must track down every scrap of evidence, balance one piece against another and then assess their significance to his subject's creative output.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Saunders does so exhaustively--and exhaustingly--first from one angle, then another and then yet another. One sixth of his book is occupied by footnotes; another twelfth by his examination of "The Good Soldier". And this is simply the first volume of two. It ends with Ford on his way to the Western Front in 1916 and, thus, to a shattering series of experiences which, after the war, he turned to triumphant account in the Tietjens tetralogy. This then, as the publisher acknowledges in its price, is a scholarly biography aimed at scholars. It helps to clear the air. It does not make for easy reading. And it raises a question. Does Ford Madox Ford really merit such intense care and immense labour? Perhaps--but only just perhaps.

</ul>


</i>

<p>THIS review requires an admission. Your correspondent is a first-born. She is therefore, on Frank Sulloway's reckoning, predisposed to be a "tough-minded conservative", with a tendency to "reject new ideas", especially when the innovation appears to challenge "long-established principles". The reader of these two books will search in vain for similar frankness about their birth order from Mr Sulloway or Joy Berthoud. That is a shame, for both authors believe that birth order is one of the most important influences on personality.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sulloway has written by far the better book. Ms Berthoud confines herself to a string of anecdotes about famous people and friends who fit her preconceptions. We learn that "children in large families may lack parental attention", that first-borns strive to "meet their parents' high expectations"; that second children are sometimes rebellious and sometimes lazy; and that youngest children can easily be spoilt. Her breezily written book makes no attempt to test her theories, let alone deal with examples that do not fit. The main fun, for London journalists, will be trying to count how many of their chums appear in it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sulloway of Harvard University is another matter. He knows that there is a long debate on the effects of birth order on personality. He admits that most reviews of the issue, including a mammoth survey of the scientific literature by two Swiss scholars, C&eacute;cile Ernst and Jules Angst, have failed to establish a connection. But he is struck by the history of Charles Darwin's findings on evolution, and especially by the fact that Darwin's close colleagues, faced with the same evidence on which he based his ideas, refused to abandon their belief in creationism. Why should it be, Mr Sulloway wondered, that some people rapidly espouse new insights while others cling to their old, erroneous ways of thinking?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To discover the answer, he has set to work on a mountain of data: mainly, studies of reactions to 28 new scientific ideas, spread over five centuries. His list includes the Copernican revolution, Newtonian physics, and Einstein's theories of relativity. For good measure, he tosses in five "conservative" theories, including spiritualism and eugenics.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Studying the reactions of contemporaries to these ideas, he finds that most scientific innovations, especially radical ones, were initiated and championed by "later-borns"--those who are not first-borns. He even quantifies his conclusion: later-borns are 5-15 times more likely to espouse radical ideas than first-borns in the early stages of a scientific revolution, while first-borns are twice as likely as later-borns to support conservative ideas. "Some people", he concludes, "are born to rebel."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For this view, he has a Darwinian explanation. Siblings within a family compete with each other for parental attention. In nature, older siblings sometimes carry the struggle to extreme lengths: blue-footed booby chicks peck their baby brothers and sisters to death if they are not getting enough to eat. In human families, younger siblings have usually had a raw deal: in ancient Japan, they were nicknamed "cold rice", after the custom of feeding them on disagreeable leftovers. Whether younger siblings develop their revolutionary traits as a result of this sort of treatment, or as a sort of Darwinian specialisation, Mr Sulloway is not entirely clear.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sadly, the principle seems altogether more complicated when applied to politics. Sometimes, it works a treat: one of the most striking of Mr Sulloway's many graphs shows the extraordinary tendency, during the Reformation in Europe, for first-borns to be martyred for adhering to the Catholic faith and later-borns to be martyred as Protestants. But the history of the French Revolution is more confusing. It was, Mr Sulloway argues, essentially a conflict between older and younger brothers. Royalists were largely first-borns. But so were the most extreme leaders of the monarchy's opponents. The moderates tended to be middle children. In the national convention that voted on whether to execute Louis XVI, first-borns were the most sharply divided group. Those from the upper classes were more likely than any other group to vote for mercy; those from the lower classes, to vote against it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"First-borns lead fashionable reforms, populist reforms and orthodox science," concludes Mr Sulloway. Later-borns espouse unpopular social causes, radical revolutions and radical scientific ideas, he says, sounding a mite as if stretching characteristics to fit the history.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The book's broad drift is hard to quarrel with. To earlier ages, it would have seemed odd not to accept that people's experiences within their own families are a powerful influence on their subsequent behaviour. After all, for centuries, birth order determined people's wealth, political power, marriageability and survival prospects. In some societies, it still does. We accept, readily enough, that differences between families--social factors--can shape political and social attitudes. Why should we give so much less weight to differences within families--linked to birth order?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three points, however, are missing from Mr Sulloway's book. First, birth order is only one of the ways in which people's experiences in their family shape their lives. Relations with parents--do they die? love you? split up?--are surely also important. And even the counterpoint of "first-born" and "later-born" is an inadequate description of the impact of siblings. Most people would instinctively assume that their gender and number was just as important; it would be good to have evidence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Secondly, his assumption that sibling behaviour is driven chiefly by instinctive competition ignores the instances where siblings collaborate for the good of the family, or gang up together against "outsiders", including parents.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is lastly a broader question. It is almost certain that a smaller proportion of people around the world have siblings than ever before in history. Put in a more roundabout way, the proportion of later-borns to first-borns is shrinking, and, if Mr Sulloway is right, that could have wide-ranging consequences. He blames, for example, the resistance of 19th-century French scientists to Darwin's theory of evolution on the unusually small size of French families, which led to a scarcity of innovatory younger sons. Will family shrinkage produce a society that is more conservative and authoritarian--a world fit for stick-in-the-mud first-borns? This first-born, for one, hopes not.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
OPENNESS TO SCIENTIFIC INNOVATION
<p>In Charles Darwin's day evolution was a heretical notion, contradicting both the Bible and common sense. Most of his contemporaries rejected the idea outright. But Darwin took it seriously, even though it made him sick with worry. He once commented that it was "like confessing a murder" to acknowledge his belief in evolution.'</p>
<p>This book is about the numerous "Darwins" in the history of Western thought who have tried to revolutionize the thinking of their day. Some of these people, like sixteenth-century philosopher Giordano Bruno, were burned at the stake. Others, more mercifully, were strangled or beheaded for their heretical beliefs. Still others, like Galileo, were strongly censured by the powerful social institutions of their time. Many radical thinkers sought protection through anonymous publication. The ever-clever Voltaire employed over a hundred different pseudonyms. This tactic did not prevent his being exiled from his beloved Paris, and later from his country, for much of his life. Despite the threat of banishment, beheading, and burning, some of these courageous people refused to be silenced.</p>
<p>Why do some people, like Darwin, accept new ideas, and yet others oppose the same innovation? In Darwin's case, compelling scientific evidence was hardly the deciding factor. He was converted to a belief in evolution by findings that, within just a few years, had been widely disseminated among his colleagues. Only Darwin was sufficiently disturbed by this evidence to consider a revolutionary explanation for it. This story is worth telling.</p>
<p>On 27 December 1831 HMS Beagle departed England on a five year circumnavigation of the world. The Beagle's orders were to survey the southern coast of South America and to conduct longitudinal measurements of the globe. On board, as the ship's naturalist, sailed Charles</p>
<p><ul> Figure I.I. The route of HMS Beagle during her circumnavigation of the globe (1831-36). Inset, upper right: The Galapagos Islands, 600 miles west of Ecuador, which the Beagle visited in September and October I835. Although Darwin spent only five weeks in this archipelago, the evidence he encountered there revolutionized his thinking about the origin of species. Darwin landed on four of the major islands: Chatham, Charles, Albemarle, and James, where he collected specimens for nine days, including three days in the highlands.</ul></p>
<p>Darwin. At twenty-two, he had recently graduated from Cambridge University in preparation for a career as a clergyman. Darwin was an amiable person with a passionate interest in geology and natural history. His uncle aptly described him as "a man of enlarged curiosity." Darwin left England a creationist believing that God had designed each creature for its intended place in the world. "Whilst on board the Beagle," he recalled in his Autobiography, "I was quite orthodox, and I remember being heartily laughed at by several of the officers (though themselves orthodox) for quoting the Bible as an unanswerable authority on some point of morality." </p>

Born to Rebel begins its far-reaching inquiry with the puzzle of sibling
relationships. Why are individuals from the same family often no more
similar in personality than those from different families? The family, as
it turns out, is not a 'shared environment' but rather a series of distinct
micro-environments in which siblings experience the family in different
ways.
<p>In Born to Rebel, Frank Sulloway presents a pioneering view of how family structure affects individual development. Birth order, he shows, is a key factor in understanding the dynamics of sibling relationships and is so fundamental to the family experience that its effects transcend gender, social class, and time. Drawing on the work of Darwin and the powerful insights to emerge from the new science of evolutionary psychology, he offers a provocative analysis of the genetic and environmental influences that together shape human behaviour.</p>
<p>Most persuasively, Sulloway's findings offer conclusive evidence that the family, with its powerful interpersonal dynamics, is a cauldron for historical change. Through revolutions in scientific and historical thought, from the Reformation to the Darwinian theory of natural selection, Sulloway demonstrates that the primary engine of history is located within families, not between them, as Marx believed. Sulloway also shows that Sigmund Freud, with his psychosexual approach to family relationships, failed to understand the true causes of individual development.</p>
<p>By moving the basis for individuality and rebellion to the tension that exists between siblings in their quest for parental favour, Born to Rebel is certain to transform the nature of biographical, sociological and historical inquiry. it confirms, in lucid and accessible argument, the contention of sociobiologist Edward 0. Wilson twenty years ago: that Darwin's evolution theories provide a solid scientific foundation for the understanding of human activity. </p>

<p><b>British history</b></p>
<h2>Few questions asked</h2><ul> <li>H<font size=-1>OPE</font> <font size=-1>AND</font> G<font size=-1>LORY</font></a>: B<font size=-1>RITAIN</font> 1900-1990.&nbsp;  By Peter Clarke.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Allen Lane/Penguin Press; 464 pages; &#163;25 and $29.95</i> <br>
</ul>

<p>PROFICIENT, lucid and civil, Professor Peter Clarke's study of the United Kingdom in the 20th century marshals a fluent narrative and wide range of data for the launching volume of Penguin's new history of Britain. Mr Clarke's strengths lie in two fields rarely combined, but both on display here: high politics and practical economics. For contemporary taste, and the purpose of the series, he offers regular intervals of social and cultural commentary too. The result is an agreeable, reliable textbook. But Mr Clarke's approach has a price. Nearly a century is covered in fewer pages than A.J.P. Taylor devoted to 30 years in his "English History 1914-1945"--in more ways than one the shadow behind this work; and attention is allocated with mechanical evenness among them, at the rate of a chapter for every eight or nine years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The consequences are, necessarily, a flattening of dramatic structure and foreshortening of analytic perspective. The decisive experiences of British history in this century were the two world wars. Besides their effects, everything else has been secondary. Here, fatally, these heights are reduced to the same level as the lowest marshlands--the first world war is dispatched in less space than the time of Harold Wilson. Under such a metronomic rhythm, proportional significance drains away. The neutralising effect is reinforced by the curiously undemanding way in which leading politicians of every camp tend to be described. An extreme case is Lloyd George, treated with conventional sentimentality ("at his incomparable best"); but even James Callaghan becomes "in many ways an impressive figure as a prime minister". Occasional wry asides do not really alter a tone of generalised indulgence, that falters only at Margaret Thatcher.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leniency of portraiture could be taken as no more than an amiable quirk. But it reflects an underlying uncertainty of theme. For what were the historic tasks against which the temperaments of successive leaders are to be measured? Mr Clarke begins his book by criticising the over-concentration of recent literature on the issue of national decline. Loss of empire may have reduced British power in the world, but the welfare of the British people has steadily increased, as economic growth and social reform have vastly improved the lot of the majority. This was Taylor's conclusion a generation ago. Since then Britain's relative standards of prosperity and welfare have sunk within the <font size=-1>OECD</font>, while absolute levels of inequality have increased. So Mr Clarke cannot end his story in quite the same way. He must instead regret that Britain missed its early chance of joining Europe, and note the toll exacted since.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, as he acknowledges, the reason Britain cold-shouldered the European Economic Community was the illusion of continuing global status. Social progress cannot be considered simply a redeeming counterpoint to imperial decline, since the one was shaped and limited by the other. Britain in 1900 was the world's premier power, and the maintenance of empire the overriding concern of its rulers. Everything distinctive about the British state was related to that one paramount aim. Yet, in Mr Clarke's account, the first world war comes virtually out of the blue, in an otherwise peaceable domestic narrative. Though assuring his readers that Britain "did the right thing" in 1939, he does not raise the more critical question whether it did so in 1914. The plunge into European killing is all but taken for granted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly, in the inter-war period, the strategic calculations of an imperial establishment are largely pushed off-stage: foreign policy reduced to emergency fare. Caustic historians of the right--Correlli Barnett, Maurice Cowling, John Charmley--offer a more vivid sense of the realities of British power in these years. Mr Clarke's centrist pastels do justice neither to the scale of imperial destiny, nor to the price it exacted. His verdict on the post-war record is an epitome of insular complacency. "British decolonisation", he opines, "was to prove relatively successful, leaving few of the scars suffered by other ex-colonial powers." So much for the partitions of India, Cyprus, Ireland--an unfinished toll of dead exceeding that of Algeria and Indochina.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The home scene is covered much more deftly. But even here, the peculiar structures of the British political order and social conflict are assumed rather than assessed, in a story that rarely pauses for comparative scrutiny. The reasons why a pre-democratic electoral system stayed unchanged; why Conservatives displaced Liberals rather than vice versa; why Labour so rarely ruled, when most voters were working-class; why attempts to regenerate industry regularly misfired; why education never achieved national coherence--questions like these fall out of the frame. The antiquated cast of the British state, now timidly at issue in current politics, finds no historical reflection here. The European Union may well make short work of such insouciance. In one of the silliest claims a publisher has made in years, Penguin announces--under the signature of David Cannadine as general editor--its new series as "the definitive history of Britain for our day and generation". On present evidence, as befits such hype, it risks anachronism at birth.

</ul><ul></ul>


IN FRANCE the start of this new publishing year is a crowded and jostling affair, with more than 300 novels appearing on the autumn lists. It is a pleasure to discover among them a few good books.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From Madame de La Fayette to Michelet, French writers have often been fascinated by the nature of female power. The exploration continues through the heroines of some of the best of this autumn's novels. They are witches, go-betweens, mystical figures, and together almost create the impression that the power of women can be described only in supernatural terms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Claude Pujade-Renaud concentrates on the confrontation between two women on a December night in 1714. A nocturnal interview with the new queen of Spain leads to the fall of Anne-Marie des Ursins, the governess to the children of Philip V of Spain. Through the marriages and intrigues that she had organised over 20 years, Anne-Marie had guided the destinies of many of the royal courts of Europe, which she hoped to bring under the control of Louis XIV.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In "La Nuit La Neige" ("Night, Snow") the thoughts and memories of that night's protagonists are subtly intertwined in a polyphony of mostly women's voices. The voices return again and again to that fateful confrontation behind closed doors, seeking to explore its secrets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What emerges from the story is an understanding of a certain type of female power. Anne-Marie des Ursins complains that her enemies attribute the practical fruits of her intelligence to witchcraft; for through their eyes a woman who wields power succeeds only by foul means, through potions or exploiting her sexuality. The reader soon comes to understand that the causes of Anne-Marie's downfall are to be sought in the struggle between her, the dowager, and a young queen unversed in courtly machinations who is attempting to establish her authority.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Witchcraft in this case is only the political pretext for demonising a woman's power. It is a reality in Marie Ndiaye's "La Sorci&egrave;re" ("The Sorceress"), which imperceptibly installs the fantastical at the very heart of the banal and everyday. In "La Femme Chang&eacute;e en B&#158;che" ("The Woman Turned into a Log") she told the story of a woman whose husband abandons her and offers her child to the devil, who lives in a dreary building in the Parisian suburbs. In her latest novel she takes us immediately to a house in a dormitory town, where Lucie, a housewife, leads her twin daughters, Maud and Lise, down to the cellar to teach them the secrets of witchcraft which are passed on from mother to daughter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lucie has been abandoned by her husband, as was her own mother before her. Both women were estranged from their spouses because they possessed powers that the men found repulsive. Despite her powers, Lucie fails to bring about a reconciliation between her parents (her mother ends up turning her father into a snail). She also fails to retain her daughters, whose own powers soon prove to be enormous. They eventually turn themselves into crows and fly off for good. In this dissolution of family ties, Lucie's everyday life is gradually consumed by the fantastical. What Ms Ndiaye provides is minute observation of a trapped creature and its reactions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Superstition and the supernatural are also at the heart of Rapha&#145;l Confiant's "La Vierge du Grand Retour" ("The Virgin of the Great Return"). It tells of the arrival in the French West Indies of a statue of the Virgin Mary that has purportedly brought about a number of miracles in metropolitan France. Philom&egrave;ne, a whore and saint, and Dictionneur, a living dictionary, gradually see through the fraud. It represents a joint effort by local churchmen and the <i>b&eacute;k&eacute;</i> (white) power structure to subdue the black population through trickery and to embezzle their offerings to Mary.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The d&eacute;nouement sees the wrong-doers punished, sinking into the sea together with their booty , while the "son of the devil himself" splits his sides laughing as he urinates on the object of adoration. Interweaving references to the Bible with stories from the popular quarter of Morne-Pichevin, the narrator traces the emergence of a unifying faith, suited to creoles. Through it they free themselves from their chains, and give the female deity a new significance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Le Roman d'Adam et Eve" ("The Story of Adam and Eve"), an erudite metaphysical thriller, is a reflection on the meaning of the original couple, and particularly on the role of the woman, who led mankind into temptation. Intrigued by a puzzling collection of photographs of women and landscapes, the narrator investigates the disappearance of Jean, the attractive and fashionable photographer who took them. The only clues are a forgotten play by Bulgakov, itself entitled "Adam and Eve", the book of Genesis and the incomplete and sometimes enigmatic stories of old Stalinist barons. In the course of his investigations, the narrator/detective gets caught up in the tortuous by-ways of the Stalinist Soviet Union, which attempted, in its own way, to create a New Man and a New Woman. And later in the machinations of the mafiaesque Russian capitalists who have succeeded the Stalinists.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A puzzle also lies at the heart of Sylvie Germain's "Eclat de Sel" ("A Fragment of Salt"). Ludvik's life and memories are left in pieces after two turning points. The first comes when he sees a blind couple dancing, the worse for drink, at a kitsch-ridden ballroom in Marianske Lazne. This spectacle persuades him that he can no longer live like a sleep-walker in communist Czechoslovakia, suffering from "blindness of the soul". The second comes when he leaves his Parisian lover, and returns to Prague, "satiated with freedom but weak in ideals".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Back in Prague, he wanders through the city, allowing his memory to unfold as a collage of diverse fragments, within which he attempts gradually, and eventually successfully, to detect the pattern that will free him of his disgust at life. Like Everyman, he has to escape from a life too full of meaning, too full of ideology, and simply one morning to open his eyes once again to gaze desiringly on the world. Whatever other criticisms may be levelled at this summer's French novels, they cannot be accused of lack of ambition.

<p><b>The Renaissance</b></p>
<h2>Flash art?</h2><ul> <li><a href="10ex300.html">W<font size=-1>ORLDLY</font> G<font size=-1>OODS</a>:</font> A N<font size=-1>EW</font> H<font size=-1>ISTORY OF THE</font> R<font size=-1>ENAISSANCE</font>.&nbsp;  By Lisa Jardine. <br>
</ul>


<p>LISA JARDINE'S richly illustrated tour of well-trod ground offers what an academic colleague has obligingly blurbed "an entirely new approach to the Renaissance". Her supposedly novel tactic is to focus on commodities and acquisitions, on the pursuit of splendour and the minutiae of trade, so as to establish that "the seeds of our own...bravura consumerism were planted in the European Renaissance".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The claim is certainly bold; but is this style of history really so original? In the 19th century it would have been. There is not much talk of economics in Jacob Burckhardt's "The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy", first published in 1860 and still rightly regarded as the single best introduction to Renaissance studies. Writing history, of course, has moved on since then and the idea that wealth had something interesting to do with the creative abundance of certain cities in 15th-century Europe is hardly news. Ms Jardine's laborious documentation of the commercial struggles that were being fought while the great artists and thinkers of the Renaissance painted and thought will be familiar stuff to historians and students.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And to the general reader. Accessible and popular works, such as those of Sir John Hale, have ploughed this furrow for a long time and with less fuss. A mere 23 pages on "Cash and Culture" in his recent book, "The Civilisation of Europe in the Renaissance" (HarperCollins, 1993) says more or less everything the curious lay person might want to know on this subject.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He also issues salutary warnings to those who would make too much of economics here. Although he writes of the Renaissance as a "purchasing extravaganza", he points out that the broad correlation between creativity and commerce is weak. Other Italian cities--notably Genoa--were as commercially active as Florence, yet produced few significant artists, writers or thinkers. The prosperity of Elizabethan England, to take another example, still left it a net importer of fine and decorative arts. So if Ms Jardine wants to establish that her lavish and almost interminable descriptions of the goods that princes and merchants fought over, commissioned and treasured shed light on the period when modern Europe rivalled classical Athens, then she has a lot of arguing to do.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet she does none. Instead, the reader gets a wealth of detail about the materials and craftsmanship of knick-knacks, soft furnishings and masterpieces that is aimless and therefore, frankly, boring. When she pauses on her tours of the stores to point to a moral in this welter of shopping and selling, the offering is usually trite. (Did you know that it was "market demand as understood by the printer and his backers" which decided "choices of texts and strategies for distributing them"? Yes.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Ms Jardine is correct in her conclusion that the world you now inhabit, "with its ruthless competitiveness, fierce consumerism, restless desire for ever wider horizons, for travel, discovery and innovation...is a world which was made in the Renaissance", then her documentation of these facets of early modern Europe might have a point. Perhaps she is correct. But she offers no evidence that is genuinely relevant to this claim, for she never considers whether ruthless competitiveness and the rest of it might not have existed before her chosen period.

PROLOGUE
<p>IN LONDON, as in every other European capital, springtime heralds the arrival of its cultural pilgrims, who throng Trafalgar Square and its surroundings, following trails well laid by the international tourist industry to lead us to the supposed roots of our Western intellectual and artistic heritage. Cameras at the ready, we trawl the museums and galleries ready to record all relevant items from our guidebook inventory of important vestiges of Europe's collective history. High on our list are the treasures of the period which formed what is broadly known as the Western tradition in art and learning - the European Renaissance.</p>
<p>London boasts one of the world's great temples to that cultural moment: the National Gallery. Its new Sainsbury Wing, designed by architect Robert Venturi (imported from North America for the task) and built under the patronage of the Sainsbury family (millionaire merchants, whose wealth was accumulated in supermarket trading), was purpose-built to house the early Renaissance collection. It is now possible for the first time to confront the spirit of the Renaissance head on - to encounter the paintings from the period grouped together chronologically and geographically, and physically to come upon them fresh, through the Sainsbury Wing's own imposing entrance to the west of the old National Gallery.</p>
<p>DUCCIO - MASACCIO - VAN EYCK - PIERO - MANTEGNA - BELLINI - LEONARDO - RAPHAEL runs the inscription deeply incised in the stone facing, for the length of the impressively grand staircase. These are the names of great masters of Renaissance painting; a roll-call of painters whose works for many people symbolize its artistic achievement and, indeed, define it. The image this assembly of artists conjures up is one of luminous canvases, sumptuous in their glowing depiction of sacred and secular figures, rich with the colour and splendour of an idealized and idealistic Renaissance world. As we ascend the staircase, we anticipate the glories of their subject matter - a familiar range of scenes from the lives of mythic heroes of antiquity, moments from the life of Christ and arrestingly realistic portraits of major political figures and their retinues from across Europe - popes and potentates, court beauties, princes' favourites and the influential rich. </p>

The flowering of civilization, the rebirth of classical scholarship and the
emergence of some of the greatest artists and thinkers the world has known:
this is the traditional view of the Renaissance.
<p>WORLDLY GOODS provides a radical reinterpretation of that Golden Age of European culture. In it, Lisa Jardine argues that while crowned heads and merchant entrepreneurs competed with each other to acquire works of art from the leading artists of the day, vicious commercial battles were being found over silks and spices and over who should control the centres for international trade around the globe. The rapidly expanding trade in printed books--a new marketable commodity seized upon with equal enthusiasm by investors and consumers--disseminated the 'new learning' via publishing houses and printing presses across Europe, stimulating what was to become the European intellectual tradition by accident as much as by design.</p>
<p>WORLDLY GOODS examines the material culture of the Renaissance in all its locations, from it western borders in Christendom to its eastern one in the Islamic Ottoman Empire. It shows how a determination to show magnificence on the part of the wealthy easily became crude competitiveness and avarice as they vied with one another to acquire rare and exotic moveable goods: paintings, tapestries, printed books, precious gems, brocades and damasks, bronzes and palaces. In doing so, Professor Jardine gives us both a dazzling vision of a rapidly changing world and a completely new understanding of the Renaissance. </p>

<p><b>Positive discrimination in America</b></p>

</ul>





<p>CONSIDER a rich young woman applying to an elite university. Her mother is Mexican: call her Perez. Her father is a white Anglo: call him Smith. If her parents had thought about it with an eye to this day, they might have chosen to call her, say, Maria Perez. Under America's affirmative action policy, she would have a much better chance of getting the college place if she could tick the Hispanic box on the application form. But if her parents instead chose to call her, say, Emily Smith, she faces much stiffer competition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is circumstances like these that make affirmative action such a contentious issue in America. Does the fate of Maria/Emily Smith/Perez do justice to the disadvantaged minorities that affirmative action was supposed to serve? Probably not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now consider another case, of a poor young black man: call him Leroy Washington. He has finished high school and has applied for a job. The interviewer is dubious--not that she's a racist, mind you, but she's hired his kind before and they are just too unreliable and difficult to work with. The company, a smallish one that does not have to apply employment preferences, is truly sorry to say they can find nothing for him. Would affirmative action have helped this young man? Perhaps so.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Neither of these scenarios is implausible. Those who oppose affirmative action use the first as evidence of the evils of race-counting; those who favour it point to the all too common plight of America's Leroy Washingtons. There is a middle ground to be trod here. Polling data show that Americans strongly support such programmes for the poor as early education, job training and so on--a fact that seems lost in the current shrill political debate. They just don't like quotas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem is that, like abortion, affirmative action was dealt with through fiat, not legislation. Thus both issues have brought out the most unseemly side of the American character--self-righteousness galloping left and right--rather than the muddled decency that is more typical of it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Barbara Bergmann's "In Defence of Affirmative Action" contains much muddled decency. The title tells it all. She knows that discrimination exists; using a convincing set of social-science arguments and statistics, she proves it. Ms Bergmann is less convincing when she asserts not only that affirmative action is the best possible response to the problems everyone admits exist, but that it can be effective, rational and precisely targeted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, Ms Bergmann is surely right to point out that by ending racial preferences, America will not--hey presto!--become a colour-blind society. Those who think that it will should take the Jesse Jackson test. He noted that when he heard footsteps behind him on a deserted street and saw a white person, he felt relief. So much for colour-blindness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tom Wicker brings up the footsteps-on-the-deserted-street scenario in "Tragic Failure: Racial Integration in America". But he seems to think that only white people fear the sight of young black men at night (and are thus irredeemably racist). This is the great flaw in his decent and muddled book: he sees everything through an exclusively racial prism.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On affirmative action, which he likes, Mr Wicker is his own worst enemy. He notes, for instance, that without quotas (which the Supreme Court struck down and many universities merrily re-instituted), Berkeley would see the "admissions of even academically qualified blacks fall by 40% to 50%". Which begs the question, is it appropriate that academically unqualified students (including football players and daughters of rich alumnae) be admitted? Apparently it is, even though one side-effect of racial preferences in elite universities is high drop-out rates for those groups so privileged.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The last and best book in this sample is William Julius Wilson's. It is an ambitious attempt to rally the country behind a basically non-racial vision to help the poor. His point is that, for the first time in history, there are substantial (mostly black) neighbourhoods where the majority of adults are idle. This fractures society, fosters crime and makes the cycle of poverty an ever more vicious one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Affirmative action plays only a small role in Mr Wilson's scheme of things. In a previous book, "The Truly Disadvantaged", he even argued against race-based preferences, suggesting instead that disadvantage was a better, less divisive standard. He has changed his mind. He now believes that racism has affected black Americans so profoundly, and uniquely, that only preferences based on a combination of race and disadvantage are appropriate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The devil of establishing any kind of preference is, of course, in the details. This is not a niggling point. It is the way affirmative action has been implemented, not its goals, that offends so many Americans. Not only has it been extended to Eskimos in Virginia and Tongans in Washington, but the actual practice has sometimes been close to sinister. Take race-norming, in which different ethnic groups were tested only against each other, not the pool as a whole. If the idea were not so demeaning (it was outlawed in 1991) it would be a classic example of technocracy gone wild. To this pragmatic issue, Mr Wilson does not speak.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He is on surer ground with his other prescriptions--notably to improve schools, in which he would include expanding school choice. Even the jobs programmes of public works he recommends might find a hearing when Americans get sick of stuffing people into prisons.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most important thing Mr Wilson does, though, is remind Americans that black residents of the ghetto--themselves a minority of black Americans--are not a different species. As his evocative interviews with hundreds of residents in Chicago's black belt show, the values of most ghetto residents are much the same as those of Americans as a whole. But these values--hard work, education, personal responsibility--are more difficult to achieve, and to transmit, when there are no jobs nearby, where the schools stink, and when the worst people seem to be the best off. Change the conditions, he argues, and the rest will come naturally.

Thinking about Affirmative Action
<p>When Bill Clinton was campaigning for the presidency in 1992 as the candidate of the Democratic Party, he promised to appoint a cabinet that "looked like America." At the time Clinton made his rather poetic promise, nobody, including his political enemies, spoke out against it. Nobody said that attempting to fulfill that promise would be a bad idea.</p>
<p>A cabinet that really looks like the American labor force would have six of its fourteen seats filled by white and minority women and two of its seats filled by minority men. As Clinton's cabinet selection process was approaching its end in early 1993, only two of the appointments had gone to women. Feminist organizations, concerned that women would again be restricted to the marginal role they had played in all previous administrations, urged publicly that more women be appointed. Women reporters at Clinton's news conferences kept asking him about it.</p>
<p>This pressure provoked an angry outburst from Clinton. He said that those pressing him to appoint more women were "playing quota games" with the selection process, implying in his response that he himself disapproved of quotas. The truth, however, was that Clinton did want to appoint more women than his predecessors had, and he had apparently decided that three was the number he wanted. Many reasonable people would call that "setting up a quota," since Clinton was trying to appoint women to a predetermined number of slots. At that point, with few vacancies left, the simplest and most practical way to ensure the appointment of a third woman was to earmark one of the remaining slots for a woman. That Clinton had done so became nakedly obvious when his first female candidate for the office of attorney general ran into trouble. He then put forward a second woman for the job and discarded her in turn when a problem arose. His third woman candidate was appointed and confirmed. She, like the other two, was obviously capable, qualified, and experienced. But by that time it was clear that Clinton had not been looking for the "best person" for the post of attorney general without regard to sex or race-- he had been looking for the "best woman." </p>

The End of Integration
<p><ul> Integration is like prohihition. If the people don't want it, a whole army can't enforce it. Paul Johnson, governor of Mississippi</ul></p>
<p>The sweeping conservative victory in the elections of 1994 returned control of Congress to Republicans, repudiated what was left of liberal government, and dramatized the tragic failure of racial integration in America.</p>
<p>Race, as it always is in a modern American election, was the underlying issue. In the autumn of 1994 that issue was a prime determinant of the outcome, as white voters everywhere expressed unmistakable yearning for a lost time, before "they" forced themselves into the nation's consciousness.</p>
<p>White animosity toward and fear of African-Americans--seen largely as criminals and welfare cheats-- gave emotional edge and added energy to the election's ostensible issues, and the campaign was fought out in code words and symbolism that disclosed rather than disguised its racial character: - Fierce denunciations of crime and welfare, in white eyes the most prominent products of the black underclass - Withering blasts at liberals and liberalism as the "social engineers" behind the "big government" that tried to force racial integration and brought higher taxes - Diatribes against "spending" and "the redistribution of wealth" to the poor, a euphemism for social programs believed primarily to aid African-Americans - Loud promises to extend the death penalty, from which AfricanAmericans suffer proportionally far more than whites - Overwrought demands for a return to "family values" (a term of many meanings, one of which is the sexual restraint that blacks are supposed by whites to disdain) </p>

From Institutional to Jobless Ghettos
<p>An elderly woman who has lived in one inner-city neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago for more than forty years reflected:</p>
<p><ul> I've been here since March 21, 1953. When I moved in, the neighborhood was intact. It was intact with homes, beautiful homes, mini mansions, with stores, laundromats, with cleaners, with Chinese [cleaners]. We had drugstores. We had hotels. We had doctors over on Thirty-ninth Street. We had doctors' offices in the neighborhood. We had the middle class and upper middle class. It has gone from affluent to where it is today. And I would like to see it come back, that we can have some of things we had. Since I came in young, and I'm a senior citizen now, I would like to see some of the things come back so I can enjoy them like we did when we first came in.</ul></p>
<p>An employed 35-year-old married woman from a South Side neighborhood shared some of her philosophy.</p>
<p><ul> I feels that . . . that everyone who wants to work and wanta' have a job should be able to walk out and get it and not take six months to do it. . . . I think, society should make a greater effort in caring for the sick, the seniors, and the peoples that's just down and out on their luck and just don't have, for whatever means. Another thing, one of my main top concerns, I feel that it's just [slow and coldly outraged], it's awful the way, throughout the city, on your South and West Side, you see all these vacant lots, all these abandoned buildings, and peoples are living in the streets. Or living four and five and ten peoples in an apartment that was allocated for one or two peoples--you find eight or ten peoples because they have no place to go and no housing available. And throughout the city, you have those abandoned buildings, and vacant buildings, and just, just areas, blocks and blocks of vacant lots, where they could be building affordable, moderate-income houses.</ul></p>
<p>A young truck driver expressed his view regarding the need for improvement in his neighborhood. "It'd be nice to see police walking around here once in a while. We need role models for the kids." A senior typist added: "Need funding to get businesses in the area. A big grocery store would generate more jobs and enable people to shop more safely and without fear."</p>
<p>A 91-year-old woman spoke of safety concerns: "It's not safe anymore because the streets aren't. When all the black businesses and shows closed down, the economy went to the dogs. The stores, the businesses, the shows, everywhere was lighted, the stores and businesses have disappeared."</p>
<p>The negative social forces triggered a decision by a concerned mother to send her son away.</p>
<p><ul> I have a 13-year-old. I sent him away when he was nine because the gangs was at him so tough, because he wouldn't join--he's a basketball player. That's all he ever cared about. They took his gym shoes off his feet. They took his clothes. Made him walk home from school. Jumped on him every day. Took his jacket off his back in subzero weather. You know, and we only live two blocks from the school. . . . A boy pulled a gun to his head and told him, "If you don't join, next week you won't be here." I had to send him out of town. His father stayed out of town. He came here last week for a week. He said, "Mom, I want to come home so bad," I said no! </ul>

A distinguished economist cuts through the incendiary rhetoric to present a
clear-eyed defense of affirmative action as a just and indispensable solution to
the persistent race and sex discrimination that splinters our society. Barbara
Bergmann's systematic defense shows why there are no effective substitutes by
which blacks and women can get equal consideration.
<p>Professor Bergmann demonstrates that slogans such as "Just enforce the laws against discrimination" are recipes for inaction. She exposes the lack of evidence that affirmative action makes people believe all blacks are incapable. Bergmann reminds us that rich white children get special consideration in the best schools and jobs, but nobody raises the cry that they are all incapable.</p>
<p>In Defense of Affirmative Action explores the issue of reverse discrimination intact are far worse. Bergmann boldly confronts the issue of quotas, acknowledging that affirmative action does involve paying attention to the numbers hired by race and sex. She argues that "preferences" for blacks and women in some openings are needed in cases where prejudice or habit leads to preference for white males in all openings. She reveals the record of many of the largest companies in integrating--or failing to integrate--their workforces.</p>
<p>Bergmann argues that it is naive or willfully dishonest to imagine that if we do away with affirmative action we will be left with a system that is sex-blind and race-blind, in which hiring and promotion are based solely on ability. Rather, continued affirmative action is needed to move us closer to a society in which merit rules. </p>

For twenty-five years Tom Wicker wrote for The New York Times with passion, intelligence and
integrity, educating a generation of readers on important political and social issues of the day. Now is
Tragic Failure? this respected observer of America develops his ideas On the subject of race relations.
<p>Not until the civil rights movement of the 1960s, one hundred years after the abolition of slavery, were African-Americans able to achieve a semblance of racial equality. Yet the successes of the movement failed to translate into full racial integration or firstclass citizenship for most blacks. The white backlash of the last several years and issues such as affirmative action, poverty, crime, unemployment, and welfare have made race the subtext for almost all political debate--the "dirty little secret" of American politics. This is a tragic failure of national proportions, which demands that America face these old questions with new answers.</p>
<p>Having been an eyewitness to the significant events of the last three decades, Wicker is informed by the perspective of history and the wisdom of years. His analysis is thoughtful, his suggestions bold and constructive--calling for, in particular, a new alignment of political allegiances. Tragic Failure is a timely, valuable contribution to the most pressing problem facing Americans today. </p>

<h2>W<font size=-1>HEN</font> W<font size=-1>ORK</font> D<font size=-1>ISAPPEARS</font>.<br></h2>
<p> By William Julius Wilson. <br>
<i>Knopf; 307 pages; $26</i><br>

"No thinker has done more than William Julius Ellson," Time magazine says, "to explain why
the black underclass sank into such misery and isolation at the same time millions of other
African-Americans were escaping from the ghetto to create a vibrant middle class."
<p>Now, in his long-awaited new book, the author of the acclaimed The Truly Disadvantaged (1987) writes about the devastating effects that the disappearance of work has on individual, family, and neighborhood life in the urban ghetto.</p>
<p>Ellson explores how the current loss of blue-collar jobs has crucially affected American society. He discusses the effects of the "suburbanization" of employment, which has excluded the black urban poor who remain isolated in neighborhoods of concentrated unemployment, neighborhoods that once featured a sizable proportion of working families. He describes the lack of locally available training and education, and the dissolution of government and private support of local organizations that once supplied job information as well as employment opportunities. And he examines as well the attitudes of employers toward ghetto residents and the resulting effects on hiring policies.</p>
<p>Interweaving the voices of scores of inner-city men and women whom he interviewed during years of intensive study, Ellson dismantles the conservative argument that the people of the ghettos lack drive and aspiration. He demonstrates that, on the contrary, their desire and quest for success and a stable life are comparable to those of society at large, but they develop within a context of constraints and opportunity drastically different from those in middle- class society.</p>
<p>Finally, Ellson outlines a series of programs that can help both the urban poor and the middle class, programs that are politically feasible at a time when government is battling to reform welfare. He defines a framework of long and short-term solutions to get America's jobless working again, including a twenty-first-century version of the WPA work program, available to all; transportation alternatives to get men and women to jobs in outlying areas; and crucial training and jobs for one of the groups with the highest unemployment rates--new high school graduates.</p>
<p>In When Work Disappears, William Julius Wilson, one of the country's most highly praised and influential sociologists, makes a major contribution to the economic and social health of the nation-- not only through his analysis of an almost overwhelming problem but through the practical steps he suggests toward a solution. </p>

</p><p>JUDITH MILLER, a <i>New York Times</i> journalist who has written on the Middle East for 20 years, is afraid that resurgent Islam and the modern world cannot be reconciled. She fears that the Arabs, having been variously betrayed by Nasserism, socialism and Baathism, may yet disastrously embrace another ideology that will prevent them regaining, as she puts it, "the prosperity, dynamism, tolerance and imagination that once characterised their civilisation".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Islamists, she argues, win power if others wield it badly. From Algeria to Syria, she notes a depressing readiness by the authorities to counter dissent with repression rather than by encouraging economic development. But dissent will not be crushed. Should regimes therefore co-opt the Islamists? Ms Miller is not convinced they should: efforts were made in Egypt to promote tamer strands of the Muslim Brotherhood, with mixed results. Ms Miller broadly accepts the view of Islamists as irredeemably radical.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This book has been criticised for taking a stereotypical view of the region as gripped by "fundamentalism". At times, it reads that way. But Islam, fundamental or otherwise, is less Ms Miller's theme than a device linking country-by-country chapters. (Iraq, which has denied her a visa for the past decade, is omitted.) Her strength is reporting. Ms Miller goes to the right places and interviews the right people, be they high or humble. Her analysis, even when debatable, is accessible to the layman without insulting the expert.</td></tr></table>

<p>JUST as the Iran of Khomeini and his successors has demonised the west, particularly the "Great Satan" America, so the west reacts to Iran. Supporter of terrorism abroad and oppressor of women at home, the Islamic Republic of Iran is what westerners love to hate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Welcome, then, to Sandra Mackey and "The Iranians". She notes the rich, persistent influence of Iran's pre-Islamic past. Whereas the Arabs dismiss their unimpressive pre-Islamic era as the period of <i>jahiliyya</i> or ignorance, the Iranians look back on sophisticated kingdoms and complex civilisations. (The decision of the Shah, a modern parvenu, to celebrate 2,500 years of the royal dynasty at Persepolis in 1971 was hubristic.) In Iran's history Islam is an Arab transplant, vying over the centuries with the tradition of kingship for the soul of the nation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Islamists who overthrew the Shah are part of a continuing contest, and the older their revolution the less its fire. Now that many mullahs drive Mercedes and take bribes, Ms Mackey spies the same seeds of self-destruction that marred the Shah's era. Iran, for her, is a society "split between a very small, very rich minority and a larger middle class struggling to survive, and the overwhelming majority of the poor." Ms Mackey accordingly believes that America's strategy of isolating Iran wins its current regime patriotic support and risks making "a monster from an adversary".</td></tr></table>

<p>ZAHIR FARES, an Algerian official educated as an economist in France, describes the causes he believes have brought his country to the brink of open civil war. Power in Algeria, he writes, has never been monopolised by one person. Unlike in neighbouring Morocco or Tunisia, Algeria's presidents and prime ministers have come and gone as if guided by invisible stage machinery. What mechanism? Algeria's predicament, Mr Far&egrave;s thinks, is the result of a clash between the perfectly legitimate nation-building aims of its rulers and the cruel demands of adjusting to world markets. That conflict would have tested any government. Algeria's army-dominated rulers made things worse, with poor development planning, massive corruption and harsh treatment of dissent.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a former Algiers-based official from France's finance ministry, Lucille Provost knows whereof she writes: French policy towards Algeria. She criticises French governments for their reluctance to treat Algeria as a normal country like any other. Though France's colonial war there ended 35 years ago, French politicians of left and right have found it hard not to treat Algeria as an amputated part of their national territory. French economic aid poured in. But it was too little to avert economic disaster or win government thanks (an official anti-France campaign was launched in Algiers late last year), and too much to persuade the Islamists that France's "non-interference" was anything but a sham.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;France instead ought to have taken its distance from Algeria's rulers, Ms Provost argues. France now, she believes, should promote talks among all sides in Algeria with help from America and even Britain, who, she says, have kept better relations with Algeria's Islamists.</td></tr></table>

 By Dilip Hiro. <br>
<i>St Martin's Press; 353 pages; $30. Macmillan; &#163;45</i><br>
<a href="8bt242.html">Biography</a><br>

<p>NO SINGLE volume can be a comprehensive reference book for a region as varied as the Middle East. But Dilip Hiro makes an impressive attempt. Entries on subjects as diverse as the Kharijis, the original Muslim "fundamentalists", and Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon are models of informed compression. Mr Hiro can see both sides of an argument, applying the same stringent scrutiny to the Zionists' Irgun and to the Arabs' Islamic Jihad.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inevitably, there are gaps. "Iran-Contra Affair", for example, is cross-referenced to "Irangate"--which then makes no reference to the Contras or to Colonel Oliver North. But this is carping. The real regret is that Mr Hiro and his publishers have chosen (presumably for reasons of space) to confine their Middle East to its geographical dimensions. Given Libya's adventurism under Colonel Qaddafi or today's turmoil in Algeria or the triumph of Islamic fundamentalism in Sudan, all of which have repercussions throughout the Middle East, it seems odd to exclude the Maghreb and Sudan.

EGYPT
<p>There are some kinds of laughter that make you cry. AL-MUTANASSI, poet (A.D. 915-965)</p>
<p>ON MY FIRST DAY as Cairo bureau chief of The New York Times in August 1983, I saw a donkey drop dead just outside my office on Kasr el Nil, a major commercial street where smart shoppers, young men on motorbikes and bicycles, donkey carts, taxis, and smoke-belching buses jostle for space on the narrow roadway. In lls-degree heat--almost as hot as my office, where the air conditioning had broken down yet again an hour earlier--the donkey probably died of exhaustion.</p>
<p>I was watching from my second-story window as the donkey stood still for a few seconds while his owner beat him across the neck and head. Then, without warning, the donkey fell over dead.</p>
<p>Instantly, a small crowd gathered around the animal, yelling advice at the owner, who by this time understood that further whipping would not revive his poor beast. But he had no idea what to do next. He put his hands on top of his white-turbaned head, the headdress typical of socalled Upper Egypt, which is, in fact, in the southern part of the country, and rocked back and forth in grief.</p>
<p>At this moment, a taxi swerved to avoid hitting the donkey and collided instead with another small black-and-white taxi. The drivers leaped out of their cars, yelling and waving their fists. The crowd grew larger, turning away from the distraught donkey owner and toward the two men on the verge of a brawl. </p>

<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
Judith Miller has spent much of her life in the Middle East covering the region
from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to Teheran, from Amman to Algiers and
Khartoum.
<p>Vivid, lucid, authoritative, God Has Ninety-nine Names is superb journalism which reveals the meaning of the tumultuous events that will shape Arab-Israeli relations as well as the prospect for war or peace in the region and the potential for worldwide terrorism.</p>
<p>Miller takes us deep within the militant Islamic movements in ten Middle Eastern countries: Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Algeria, Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel, and Iran. She shows that as there is no unified Arab world, so there is no unified Islam, for even in the Koran, God has ninety-nine names.</p>
<p>For all her intimate knowledge of the region and its people, Miller is first of all a storyteller who leads the reader into a crowded prison courtyard in Omdurman, where she sits as the only woman amid a thousand or more Islamists awaiting the hanging of an old man, a Sudanese intellectual sent to the gallows for betraying his religion. She takes the reader on a tense visit to the terrorist headquarters of militant Islam's Hezbollah just above the Israeli border in Lebanon, and later on a bouncing tractor across a Libyan oasis with the halfmad, half-shrewd, and always operatic Colonel Muammar Qaddafi, and then into a top secret Israeli interrogation room, where she watches a terrorist leader, who happens to be an American citizen, in the act of betraying his Palestinian comrades.</p>
<p>The militant Islamic movements that Miller describes are as different as the countries in which they have arisen. Seeking to replace secular government with holy writ, some of these radical groups propose nonviolent change, while others take to their guns, but the tendency for all these movements is to shift opportunistically between persuasion and violence as the regimes they oppose weaken under crushing demographic and developmental burdens.</p>
<p>Relying on her personal relationships with leaders as diverse as Libya's vain and mercurial Qaddafi, Jordan's contemplative yet fearless King Hussein, and Israel's late Yitzhak Rabin, Miller introduces her readers to the region's ruling powers. She shows that their methods of combating militant Islam are as diverse as the Islamic movements themselves, ranging from the murderous state terror of Syria's Hafiz Assad to the policy of cooptation practiced by Saudi Arabia's autocratic king.</p>
<p>Miller offers abundant evidence to convince advocates of human rights to mistrust the intentions of these movements as she documents the threat many of them pose to women, intellectuals, Christians, and other minorities in the Middle East. But she also shows how the failure of most Middle Eastern governments to combat, much less solve, the problems of underdevelopment has permitted these militant groups to flourish and in some cases, perhaps, eventually to prevail. </p>

The Glory of Persia
<p>THE ANCIENT TOWN OF YAZD SAT IN THAT PERFECT MOMENT when darkness breaks to dawn. Across the landscape, early grasses were thrusting their green shoots through the hard brown soil and the fruit trees held swollen buds waiting to burst into bloom. As the sun rose on March 21, the vernal equinox, Yazd and the rest of Iran welcomed the Iranian New Year--No Ruz.</p>
<p>In a modest, flat-roofed, middle-class house belonging to the Rajavi family, the festivities had actually begun the preceding Wednesday, Joyous Wednesday. Relatives had arrived in drips and waves from as near as Tehran and as far as France. They came bearing fat bouquets of yellow daffodils mixed with red tulips and oversize containers holding enough food to feed everyone in the family for the next week. Before darkness fell, a match touched the sticks and straws stacked in the little garden at the front of the house, producing a minature bonfire. Everyone old enough or young enough to walk jumped the fire, chanting a couplet directed toward the sun: "May your red radiance come to me, May my yellow tiredness go to you."</p>
<p>Inside the No Ruz table held seven vessels, the number of the holy immortals of Zoroastrianism, filled with food, seeds, coins, or anything beginning with the letters. Why the letters is lost in the mysteries of time. But each of the other objects held a precise meaning. Two candles represented light and dark; a mirror reflected evil; a bowl of goldfish symbolized life; and painted eggs depicted fertility.</p>
<p>The Rajavis as Muslims placed a Koran on the front left corner of the little table. In Christian, Zoroastrian, and Jewish homes the holy book was the Bible, the Avesta, or the Torah.</p>
<p>The Iranians have been celebrating No Ruz since before the reign of Cyrus the Great in the fifth century B.C. Originally the planting festival of prehistoric, agrarian Iranians, it was later given ethical meaning by the teachings of the prophet Zoroaster. The twelve-day holiday garbed in all its Persian trappings has survived at least twenty-five centuries of invasion and foreign rule, as well as the Islamic Revolution. Ignoring its history as a holiday dedicated to the three holy elements of Zoroastrianism--fire, earth, and water every Iranian celebrates No Ruz as the commemoration of his nation's Persian past.</p>
<p>In the twelve hundred years between the founding of the Persian Empire and the arrival of Islam in the seventh century A.D., Persian culture and Persian identity took form on the Iranian plateau. It developed under the four dynasties of pre-Islamic Iran--the Achaemenian, Seleucid, Parthian, and Sassanian. Each dynasty made its own history of successes and failures. But central to each were the themes of governance and culture that are as relevant today as they were in the ancient past. Although there are others, the three predominant themes that pre-Islamic Iran handed down to succeeding generations are the concepts of a powerful king ruling in the name of justice, the continuity of a distinct culture, and a sense of nationhood rooted more in cultural identity than in either government or territory. For 2,500 years, the inheritance that ancient Persia bequeathed to Iran has exerted its powerful influence over Iranians culturally, socially, and politically. And its ethos binds those within the Islamic Republic to those Iranians now in exile. In certain core values, basic attitudes, and selfperception, Iranians have lived in a continuum that stretches from Cyrus the Great through Ayatollah Khomeini. </p>

<h2>T<font size=-1>HE</font> I<font size=-1>RANIANS</font>.<br></h2>

<i>Dutton; 464 pages; $26.95</i><br>
</p><br>

Iran occupies a pivotal position in the Middle East and in the world today, as
throughout history. With its vast land mass and immense natural resources, its
own unique cultural heritage and sense of separate identity, and its key strategic
location dominating the Persian Gulf and bordering former Soviet republics as
well as Iraq and otherArab states, this proud and profoundly divided country is
a perpetually ticking time bomb.
<p>In The Iranians, eminent Middle East expert Sandra Mackey brings us invaluable understanding of a complex, contradictory, and sometimes volatile people. Beginning with the ancient Persian empires that ruled from India to Greece and later humbled mighty Rome, and tracking the waves of invasions that culminated in the triumph of the Arabs under the banner of Islam, she delineates the opposing poles of identity and power that have vied for the Iranian state and the Iranian soul. On the one hand, there is the Persian concept of kingship, in which the nation is guided toward its destiny by a single strong ruler. On the other, there is the Islamic concept of a community of believers in which the faith of Muhammad reigns supreme over every facet of life. This dramatic conflict has played itself out over centuries, intensifying in the twentieth century when Iranians also confronted the issue of modernization in the mode of the West. In the last decades, the Iranians' intertwined destinies of Persia and Islam resulted in the violent shift of leadership and policy from the imperious "King of Kings," Muhammad Reza Shah, to the zealous Ayatollah Khomeini.Without a current icon of culture and authority, the Iranians now struggle with their present and search for their future in the decaying Iranian Revolution.</p>
<p>The author's personal knowledge of Iran gives her; book a superbly human dimension. Sandra Mackey has had more unrestricted movement within the Iranian Islamic Republic than any other American journalist. Her eyewitness account gives the reader a uniquely authentic present-day picture of Iran and the Iranians from the cities to the countryside and from humble mosques to the chaotic political arena governed by the clerics of Shia Islam, as pressures build for a new definition of revolutionary Iran that may we shake the region and the world. </p>

<p>Peut-on confondre les erreurs commises depuis trente ans, et l'impulsion donnee a l'Algerie par cete quete du nationalisme algerien vers l'unicite ? C'est ce qui sous-tend, tres souvent, les analyses sur la crise actuelle que connait l'Algerie et dont les manifestations, apparentes, sont economiques, sociales et culturelles et, enfin, politiques.</p>
<p>La crise est bien la. Elle touche l'ensemble de la societe et influence le comportement de chaque citoyen pour qui, depuis trente ans, la crise prend l'aspect de l'eternel probleme de l'approvisionnement du marche, qu'aucun fgouvernement n'a su resoudre, avec ou sans ressources petrolieres.</p>
<p>Devant l'ampleur du phenomene et sa complexite, il serait hasardeux et simpliste, donc manipulateur, de repertorier les causes de fa,con mecanique. Car, le monde est fait d'interdependances repoussant, ainsi, et a l' infini, la cause originelle d'une crise.</p>
<p>Et puis, la vie politique dans tous les pays, depuis la fin de la bipolarite dans les relations internationales, semble steloigner des conflits, dont les causes etaient relativement vusees a connaitre la lute Est - Ouest -, pour entrer dans Pere des crises. A peine un pays a-t-il eu le temps d'apporter des solutions a un probleme, que nait une nouvelle crise. Des conflits entre les classes sociales debouchant sur l'espoir d'une &lt;&lt; nouvelle societe &gt;&gt;, l'on en vient a la societe inchangee dans son contenu, mais qui remodele regulierement son visage. Chaque crise fait apparaitre des regroupements temporaires depassant les clivages politiques traditionnels. </p>

ALGERIE: LE BONHEUR OU SON CONTRAIRE
<p>En Algerie, l'Histoire montre que le pouvoir n'est plus a prendre ! Car le systeme est conc,u pour durer, non par la volonte des hommes mais par un consensus inconscient de la societe. II a debute ainsi: a une Algerie multi- partisane des annees 30 et 40, a succede un systeme politique que de jeunes revolutionnaires ont fonde, au pied de la leare, sur le principe d'une direction qui ecarte le leadership d' un individu seul. Par la suite, une foule impressionnante d'hommes ont approche le pouvoir et y ont participe. Quand on observe ces hommes dans le court terme, c'est-a-dire, durant le temps de leur passage aux affaires, on s'aper,coit qu'ils ne font qu'assumer, bon gre, mal gre, la meme mission. II en resulte bien, qu'en Algerie, depuis le ler novembre 1954, le pouvoir n'est plus a prendre, c'est-adire que, sur l'essentiel de sa logique de vie, il n'est plus a faire.</p>
<p>Affirmation paradoxale si l'on ne voit que les luttes partisanes des hommes et l'inefficacite relative de l'Etat; conclusion acceptable lorsqu'on constate que ni la guerre ni les crises n'ont ebranle le ceur de cete logique.</p>
<p>Temps et espace, comme moteurs de la vie politique en Algerie sont les referents de ce livre d'idees sur le pouvoir pour mieux apprehender les causes essentielles des crises, les invariants de l'ideologie nationaliste qui fac,onnent les logiques du pouvoir, et enfin ses probabilites d' adaptation et par voie de consequence ses capacites a anticiper. Ou encore comment la recherche du Bonheur est sans cesse detournee. </p>

<p><b>Internet magazines</b></p>
<h2>Webzine dreams</h2>

<p><b>With electronic "little magazines", the new "digirati" are aiming to transform literary and cultural journalism</b></p><ul></ul>



"JOURNALISM", declares <i>Salon, </i>one of the Internet's new interactive literary and cultural magazines, "has become a pitiful giant, ensnarled by commercial formulas and political tribalism. Where once its voice shook mountains, it now squeaks cautiously and banally. The Net allows publishers to burst these bonds, to howl again."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Howl", of course, was Allen Ginsberg's cry of rage and protest way back in 1956. Put out by City Lights, a tiny San Francisco publisher, it was the Beat generation's poetic manifesto and anticipated the counter-culture of the 1960s. Now <i>Salon </i>seems to be predicting that the Internet will do something similar for publishing. The explosion of on-line magazines--about 150 have been launched in the past year alone--shows that net publishing is cheap and easy. For even a casual surfer, the Internet's multimedia side, the World Wide Web, has overnight become the biggest newsagent in the world, with on-line magazines catering to any taste, from literary theory to conspiracy theory, with much hip "attitude" thrown in.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A similar publishing underground emerged around the photocopier a decade or so ago. Amateur "zines" flowered by the hundreds in the 1980s, often out of the music scene. About the same time in the computer world, bulletin board systems (<font size=-1>BBS</font>s)--computers hooked to telephone lines users could call into--began sprouting by the hundreds. The Internet combines these two cultures, without many of their distribution limitations. Paper zines go hand to hand or by post. <font size=-1>BBS</font>s take technical skill and tend only to serve people a local call away. The Internet, by contrast, is easy to use and global.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of the Internet's new "web-zines" or "e-zines" ruminate about the net, about computers, indeed about anything digital. But publications of wider interest are also springing up, designed from scratch for hypertext and multimedia. Computer geeks-turned-writers and fans-turned-critics pump out pages of new material daily. It may not be quite yet the counter-cultural revolution hoped for by <i>Salon</i> and still less the "way new journalism" dreamed of by the digital literati or digirati--jacked-in, latter-day Tom Wolfes with technical savvy and cultural poise. But it looks headed that way in an exciting and creative turmoil.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These are a few of the better web-zines that it is chic to hit:<br><li><i>Hot</i>w<i>ired</i> (<a href="http://www.hotwired.com/">http://www.hotwired.com</a>) was the first big-time Internet magazine, and in certain ways still defines the genre. It started barely two years ago as a "walk-the-talk" version of its print-parent <i>Wired.</i> Nowadays the two share little but their modish pose. <i>Hot</i>w<i>ired </i>has its own editorial content, staff and readers. It has wisely dropped <i>Wired</i>'s psychedelic typography in the interest of faster downloads and readable screens.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Its cultural coverage includes capsule reviews of books, music and <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s; new art; a serialised bodice-ripper; and criticism of television (American only, alas) and films. Sports coverage ranges from tips on trick knees to a climbing diary, while its travel section, in one recent week, looked mockingly at Japan and delved into New York kitsch. There is a bit of politics, a hand-waving economics column and an unhelpful agony aunt: (Q:"I've got no friends." A:"Talk to someone.")<br><li><i>Suck</i> (<A href="http://www.suck.com/">http://www.suck.com</a>) was founded last year by two more-wired-than-thou production workers at <i>Hotwired</i>, full of scorn for the media's fawning over dim Internet offerings. It is a daily outpouring of delightful vituperation, done as a single, snaking column of text. Often working all night, the team writes scathing reviews of digital sacred cows. Favourite targets are <i>Wired</i> and the Web efforts of traditional media everywhere. When Time Warner decided to copy <i>Suck </i>with an imitation (<i>Netly News</i>: (<a href="http://www.pathfinder.com/Netly/">http://www.pathfinder.com/Netly</a>), the Sucksters unmasked the feeble pretender while it was still in development. No media multinational caught dressing is pretty. Ominously, <i>Suck</i> has now been bought by <i>Hot</i>w<i>ired</i>, although it is still run independently. Fans are watching for any signs of a creeping sell-out.<br><li><i>Word</i> (<A href="http://www.word.com">http://www.word.com</a>) carries its attitude in its design. Unfortunately, in between its surreal, changing graphics is writing that brings up memories of student literary magazines. Despite a <i>Hot</i>w<i>ired</i>-like breadth of subject matter, <i>Word </i>is a lot more style than substance (<i>Spiv</i>, launched in January by Turner Entertainment, is an even more frothy example of this). But with its creative use of the Web's hypertext linking and multimedia, <i>Word </i>gives a glimpse of what Internet publishing will be, especially when faster connections (over a modem and a regular telephone line, <i>Word</i>'s flowing visuals become stuttering tedium) allow its graphic designers free rein. This is no surprise. <i>Word </i>is published by an Internet consulting firm which uses it as a showcase for its talents. Indeed, <i>Urban Desires</i> (<a href="http://www.desires.com/">http://www.desires.com</a>), a less showy but equally interactive web-zine, is published by a competing consulting firm.<br><li><i>Feed</i> (<a href="http://www.feedmag.com/">http://www.feedmag.com</a>) is the opposite of <i>Word</i>: all substance, little style and very little pose of any kind. It takes a detached view of new technology. It values the net as a medium, but prefers to carry its own message: multimedia click-fests are no substitute for solid thinking and fine writing. <i>Feed</i> offers essays and dialogues on cultural topics from Hollywood's failed flirtation with techno-thrillers to the link between today's geeks and yesterday's hippies. Counter-cultural preoccupations are evident: a debate on drug-law reform now rages on its pages. But <i>Feed</i> is not revolutionary. "The current frenzy to re-invent journalism from scratch looks like a dangerous mix of unchecked hubris and cultural amnesia," <i>Feed</i>'s editor says. This is cyberspace for grown-ups.<br><li><i>Salon </i> (<a href="http://www.salon1999.com/">http://www.salon1999.com</a>) also offers a safe haven for 40-somethings unmoved by surfing metaphors. Like <i>Feed</i>, it concentrates on books, movies, television, music and " ideas", all with an un-<i>Suck</i>-like seriousness and maturity. A sample of recent fare: an interview with Helen Mirren, a look at Martin Scorsese's use of music, a report on a Bruce Springsteen tour and a photo-essay on young black men. Well-known authors keep the writing at a high, if predictable, standard. Where are those new voices, where is the howling that <i>Salon </i>grandly promised? Perhaps the no-names do not write well enough to attract corporate sponsors, of which <i>Salon </i>has many. The net world may not be so different from the old world after all.

<h2>Two opinions</h2><ul> <li>T<font size=-1>HE</font> S<font size=-1>UPREME</font> C<font size=-1>OURT</font> <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>.</a>&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Walnut Creek; $39.95</i>. <br>
 <li>USSC <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>.</a>&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>InfoSynthesis Inc; $145</i> <br>
</ul>



<p>THE full set of the official reports of the United States Supreme Court from 1790 forward fills more than 500 substantial volumes. Because of the critical role the court plays in deciding the biggest political issues in America, from the availability of abortion to the geographic boundaries of legislative districts, access to its opinions is useful not only to lawyers but also to political scientists, ethicists and political philosophers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This leaves an obvious gap in the market for a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> that contains all the opinions of the Supreme Court--opinions which cannot be copyrighted and so can be reproduced without payment of royalties. Such a portable guide would be much cheaper than the 500 tomes and would save law firms many yards of bookshelf space. Unfortunately, Walnut Creek has not produced it. Its single disc contains 544 cases filed from 1988 to 1994 plus the written arguments of the attorneys to the court in 48 cases filed in 1991 and 1992. In its lack of completeness, the disc is akin to publishing only volume 23 of a 25-volume encyclopedia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Walnut Creek's method of legal citation is deficient, the search methods are primitive and the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> comes without instructions. An attorney and a professional computer expert we collared could not work out how to use it, although a law librarian had the necessary intuition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The InfoSynthesis Supreme Court <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> contains over 5,000 opinions, including full coverage from 1966 onwards, together with another 450 earlier leading cases. It now holds the equivalent of some 200 volumes of the "United States Reports", but will be updated twice a year and extended backwards at the rate of an additional seven or eight years each year until it includes every opinion, a remarkable feat in its way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Useful documentation is provided. A variety of sophisticated search methods are available, including indexed full-text searching for words or phrases using Boolean operators, "wild cards", proximity searches, wordstems and thesaurus operators. Hyperlinking permits the user to click and go readily from one opinion to an opinion it cites. The disc is a model of intelligent development of a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>.

<p><b>Japan</b></p>
<h2>Villains all</h2><ul><li><a href="4ex69.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> D<font size=-1>ARK</font> S<font size=-1>IDE</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> J<font size=-1>APANESE</font> B<font size=-1>USINESS</font></a>: T<font size=-1>HREE</font> I<font size=-1>NDUSTRY</font> N<font size=-1>OVELS</font>&nbsp; By Ikko Shimizu; translated by Tamae Prindle.<br>
</ul>

HOSE who have been lured to fiction about Japan by the likes of Kazuo Ishiguro ("A Pale View of Hills", "An Artist of the Floating World") might reasonably be pained by this book. It is appallingly written (or translated?). The three novels it contains have rudimentary plots and wooden dialogue. In literary terms they reach the standard of the comic books known as <i>manga</i> much read by Japanese adults, although perhaps are not as well crafted. But do not be put off. They are of interest. They depict Japanese business as nasty and businessmen as villains. As the books sell in large numbers in Japan this is presumably how ordinary Japanese view the driving force of the world's second biggest economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Commerce is equated with prostitution in "The Ibis Cage". Making such a link is not in itself original. Tarts become tarts for the money. What distinguishes this story is its emphasis on investment. Sugika is a businesswoman. She has invested much time and money in training her daughter to be appealing to men. The daughter is now 18 and a virgin. Sugika reckons that one night with her daughter, when she will be "deflowered", should be worth 1m ($9,500). She settles for 600,000, with 500,000 for subsequent "pillow services".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the novel "Keiretsu" (business partnership) the boss of Tokyo Motors is a bully. His front teeth are stained from smoking. He is "short, pudgy". He has "bleary eyes that bespoke heavy drinking the night before". His full loathsomeness emerges as he plots to get control of the firm that supplies Tokyo Motors with headlights. Cheaper headlights are his aim, or, as the novel puts it, he wants to "suck" the firm into his "radical cost-reduction scheme".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The villain in "Silver Sanctuary" is not a person but the banking system. A woman cashier feels persecuted in the stifling world of money and starts going out with men, using bright lipstick and even drinking whisky. Eventually she gives up her career and any prospects of marriage. "I'm already 29," she announces mournfully.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Villainy in business is not new to fiction. Evil tycoons turned up regularly in British popular fiction in the 1930s, although cost-reduction schemes were not the basis of their misdeeds. A typically sinister figure was an arms maker stirring up trouble to provide a market for his goods. That is old-fashioned stuff, but women over the hill at 29 and tycoons reluctant to use a toothbrush are also characters with a dated air about them. However, these novels, for all their awfulness, may be a reasonable reflection of Japanese concerns. The electronic marvels for which Japan is admired are for export; domestically, Japan is reluctant to abandon the past.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan's capacity for self-abasement has become a clich&eacute;. In Ikko Shimizu, author of more than 100 novels, this clich&eacute; has found its appropriate voice.

El personaje central de esta novela es un cuerpo. Un cuerpo que, con la muerte,
cobra una sonoridad sin par y redefine en forma mitica a la mujer que lo
habitaba. Pocas veces un simbolo ha afiebrado tanto la imaginacion de un pais
como el cuerpo muerto de Eva Peron. Santa Evita cuenta por primera vez el
larguisimo calvario que sufrio ese cadaver embalsamado y retrata en forma
admirablemente vivida los personajes que acompanaron su peregrinaje:
militares que enloquecen y asesinan para no perderlo; manos anonimas que
depositan velas encendidas y flores silvestres en cada escondite del cadaver;
peluqueros; actores fracasados; proyectoristas de cine; guardiacarceles de la
Patagonia; un embalsamador que se niega a abandonar su obra maestra... Todos
ellos desfilan por las deslumbrantes paginas de este libro, asi como la Evita
nina, la actriz provinciana a la conquista de Buenos Aires, la protectora de los
pobres, la Primera Dama adorada y odiada hasta la desmesura, la mas arbitraria
y magnetica de las mujeres argentinas.
<p>Tomas Eloy Martinez ha escrito un relato de intensidad y belleza infrecuentes en la literatura actual. Por su minuciosa construccion, su vertiginoso lirismo y la profundidad con que retrata las obsesiones que el nombre de Eva Peron sigue desatando en la Argentina, Santa Evita esta llamada a convertirse en una de las grandes novelas de nuestro tiempo. </p>

WHEN Latin American literature hit the bestseller lists in the late 1960s readers delighted in the fantasy worlds of unpredictable happenings and larger-than-life characters. Actually, the so-called "boom" writers insisted less on the magic than on the realism of their writing. Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the best-known "boomer" of all, liked to say that any resemblance to real people or events in his fiction was due not to coincidence but to the author's hard work. Often trained, like him, as journalists, other Latin American novelists saw themselves as chroniclers of a forgotten continent, writing for local readers ignorant of their hinterlands and for foreign readers attracted by exotic settings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After a six-year gap filled by a long but failed attempt to become Peruvian president, Mario Vargas Llosa returned to fiction with "Lituma en los Andes". The novel investigates disappearances in an abandoned mining community high up in the bleak Andes through a recurrent character, a police sergeant called Lituma. Mr Vargas Llosa writes brilliantly crafted novels which baffle readers with shifts from past to present and intertwining plots. Using acute dialogue (mostly lost in translation), Mr Vargas Llosa explains through Lituma what life is like in areas made remote as much by the altitude and barren land as by the Shining Path guerrillas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lituma feels himself a Martian, and so will readers as they learn about such sinister oddities as Pishtacos, a white man who kidnaps Indians to boil down their fat or about villages where foreigners are stoned to death. Only a cantina-keeper and his witch-doctor wife understand the closed Indian world. That the guerrilla Abimael Guzman has been captured and that the Shining Path is no longer a threat in Peru does not detract from the novel's appeal, but does show the risks factual fiction runs when competing with the news.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Noticia de un Secuestro" is Mr Garcia Marquez's exploration of what bedevils his country, Colombia: the power and arrogance of the Cali and Medellin drug barons, especially Pablo Escobar. The author has gone to extraordinary lengths to get the exact details about those kidnapped--the wife of a powerful newspaper owner, a television personality, and others linked to the Gaviria government. All his narrative skills are deployed in this journalistic tour-de-force, as if non-fiction best explores Colombia's ills. The writer here is able to comment on actuality and bemoan the ruthlessness and appeal of a man like the legendary Escobar.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Heading bestseller lists from Argentina to Mexico is Tomas Eloy Martinez's ten-years-in-the-writing novel "Santa Evita", which explores the potency of the Evita Peron legend. It opens with Evita's death from cancer of the womb in 1952, and narrates the outlandish farce of what happened to her embalmed corpse. This is factual surrealism, and Mr Eloy Martinez, a fine journalist at <i>Pagina 12</i>, enters his fiction to transpose long interviews with Evita's hairdresser, with the widow of the secretive code-specialist and spy, Moori Koenig, who is in charge of hiding the corpse, and with the embalmer himself, Dr Ara.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The novel reads more like a folder of files and notes interlaced with speculations as to why Evita became such a potent myth (between 1952 and 1954 the Vatican received nearly 40,000 letters attesting to Evita's miraculous powers). The central character of Moori Koenig is memorably evoked, as are details such as the embalmed corpse's smell--almonds and lavender--or the eight identical dolls made of Evita to fox the Peronist <i>descamisados</i> (shirtless ones), or the star-shaped identification mark Dr Ara cut behind Evita's left ear. As a coup leader said, "Dead, that woman is still more dangerous than when alive." Mr Eloy Martinez continually questions his own writing to add further layers of confusion between legend and fact, despite lulls and over-writing. "Everything in the book", he has said, "is true."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An exiled Paraguayan novelist, Augusto Roa Bastos, said much the same ("all the people are real") in the preface to his novel "Madama Sui". After 47 years in exile from his "almost forgotten country", Mr Roa Bastos looked into the story of a half-Japanese girl that he knew at school in Manora nicknamed Sui from the Guarani <i>"suinda", </i>meaning owl. Sui wanted to emulate Eliza Lynch, an Irish mistress of the dictator Solano Lopez, and admired Evita Peron. Picked from a beauty competition by the dictator Stroessner (not dignified with his name in the novel), she became his concubine for two years. From her 20 notebooks, Mr Roa Bastos "compiled" a life in her own words, one that dwelt especially on a love affair with the lesbian ex-Nazi who ran Stroessner's harem.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much of the novel is in the form of interviews with an Italian architect who was Sui's platonic lover and mentor. The sensual, strangely innocent Sui stayed in love with a school-friend nicknamed El who fought the dictatorship as a guerrilla. She committed suicide, aged 20, when he died. Mr Roa Bastos not only claimed that everything was true, but also that his writing exploited a woman's intuition. Refusing the novelist's usual claim of omniscience, he explores how gossip and legend complicate what may or may not have happened.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While Mr Roa Bastos has manfully tried to write a woman's version of events, an arguably more exciting branch of post-boom writing is women's fiction itself, which is nearly always succinct and short. Laura Esquivel is already well known for a novel-turned-film and for "La Ley del Amor", a novel complete with cartoons and <font size=-1>CD</font>. She has now written a pastiche science-fiction story based on a rape and murder in Tenochtitlan (Mexico city) in 1527, with consequent unhappiness in 23rd-century Mexico. The plot--the term is relative--revolves about Azucena, an astro-analyst aware of her past lives and searching for an ideal love. There are gender changes, mind-reading plants, thought photographs, astro-telephones, spaceships and lots more pastiche sci-fi elements, written in slangy Mexican, and based on the law of love which is to atone for past crimes and hates, so expiating the traumas of the Spanish conquest. Despite dense-sounding detail, the novel is light and exuberant.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lightness of touch is also to be found in Carmen Boullosa's seventh novel, "Duerme", a mock adventure story about Claire, a cross-dressing French whore. She becomes a pirate, is kidnapped, has to pass for a colonial Spanish grandee, the Conde Urquiza, and is later hanged. An Indian saves her, however, by cutting open her breasts and filling her with a magic Aztec water. Claire befriends a poet, becomes a viceroy's bodyguard and witnesses a play, but then flees Mexico city and is paralysed forever in a coma. A fairy-tale tone merges with digressions reminiscent of the tales of Italo Calvino, with dreams and with zany plot-twists, all finely worked in a delicate, humorous Mexican Spanish. The feminist viewpoint is not forced or schematic; Claire simply resents being a woman.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To judge from these recent works, younger Latin American novelists have moved out from the shadow of the "boom" generation. They are questioning omniscient fiction- and history-writing. New writers, often women, feel they can be quirkily good without having to be the voices or interpreters of a continent.

CUANDO VIO APARECER a la india en la puerta de la choza, Lituma adivino
lo que la mujer iba a decir. Y ella lo dijo, pero en quechua, mascullando y
soltando un hilito de saliva por las comisuras de su boca sin dientes.
<p>--Que dice, Tomasito? --No le entendi bien, mi cabo.</p>
<p>El guardia se dirigio a la recien llegada, en quechua tambien, indicandole con las manos que hablara despacio. La india repitio esos sonidos indiferenciables que a Lituma le hacian el efecto de una musica barbara. Se sintio, de pronto, muy nervioso.</p>
<p>--Que anda diciendo? --Se le ha perdido el marido--murmuro su adjunto--. Hace cuatro dias, parece. --Y ya van tres--balbuceo Lituma, sintiendo que la cara se le llenaba de sudor--. Puta madre. --Que vamos a hacer, pues, mi cabo. --Tomale la declaracion.--Un escalofrio subio y bajo por la espina dorsal de Lituma--. Que te cuente lo que sepa. --Pero que esta pasando aqui--exclamo el guardia civil--. Primero el mudito, despues el albino. Ahora uno de los capataces de la carretera. No puede ser, pues, mi cabo.</p>
<p>No podia, pero pasaba, y por tercera vez. Lituma imagino las caras inexpresivas, los ojitos glaciales con que lo observaria la gente de Naccos, los peones del campamento, los indios comuneros, cuando fuera a preguntarles si sabian el paradero del marido de esta mujer y sintio el desconsuelo y la impotencia de las veces que intento interrogarlos sobre los otros desaparecidos: cabezas negando, monosilabos, miradas huidizas, bocas y cenos fruncidos, presentimiento de amenazas. Seria lo mismo esta vez.</p>
<p>Tomas habia comenzado a interrogar a la mujer; iba tomando notas en una libreta, con un lapiz mal tajado que, de tanto en tanto, se mojaba en la lengua. &lt;&lt;Ya los tenemos encima a los terrucos&gt;&gt;, penso Lituma. &lt;&lt;Cualquier noche vendran.&gt;&gt; Era tambien una mujer la que habia denunciado la desaparicion del albino: madre o esposa, nunca lo supieron. El hombre habia salido a trabajar, o de trabajar, y no habia llegado a su destino. Pedrito bajo al pueblo a comprar una botella de cerveza para los guardias y nunca regreso. Nadie los habia visto, nadie habia notado en ellos miedo, aprension, enfermedad, antes de que se esfumaran. cSe los habian tragado los cerros, entonces? Despues de tres semanas, el cabo Litema y el guardia Tomas Carreno seguian tan en la luna como el primer dia. Y, ahora, un tercero. La gran puta. Lituma se limpio las manos en el pantalon. </p>

Antes de entrar en el automovil miro por encima del hombro para estar segura
de que nadie la acechaba. Eran las siete y cinco de la noche en Bogota. Habia
oscurecido una hora antes, el Parque Nacional estaba mal iluminado y los
arboles sin hojas tenian un perfil fantasmal contra el cielo turbio y triste, pero
no habia a la vista nada que temer. Maruja se sento detras del chofer, a pesar de
su rango, porque siempre le parecio el puesto mas comodo. Beatriz subio por la
otra puerta y se sento a su derecha. Tenian casi una hora de retraso en la rutina
diaria, y ambas se veian cansadas despues de una tarde soporifera con tres
reuniones ejecutivas. Sobre todo Maruja, que la noche anterior habia tenido
fiesta en su casa y no pudo dormir mas de tres horas. Estiro las piernas
entumecidas, cerro los ojos con la cabeza apoyada en el espaldar, y dio la orden
de rutina:
--A la casa, por favor.
<p>Regresaban como todos los dias, a veces por una ruta, a veces por otra, tanto por razones de seguridad como por los nudos del transito. El Renault 21 era nuevo y confortable, y el chofer lo conducia con un rigor cauteloso. La mejor alternativa de aquella noche fue la avenida Circunvalar hacia el norte. Encontraron los tres semaforos en verde y el trafico del anochecer estaba me nos embrollado que de costumbre. Aun en los dias peores hacian media hora desde las of icinas hasta la casa de Maruja, en la transversal Tercera n.o 84A-42 y el chofer llevaba despues a Beatriz a la suya, distante unas siete cuadras.</p>
<p>Maruja pertenecia a una familia de intelectuales notables con varias generaciones de periodistas. Ella misma lo era, y varias veces premiada. Desde hacia dos meses era directora de Focine, la compania estatal de fomento cinematografico. Beatriz, cunada suya y su asistente personal, era una fisioterapeuta de larga experiencia que habia hecho una pausa para cambiar de tema por un tiempo. Su responsabilidad mayor en Focine era ocuparse de todo lo que tenia que ver con la prensa. Ninguna de las dos tenia nada que temer, pero Maruja habia adquirido la costumbre casi inconsciente de mirar hacia atras por encima del hombro, desde el agosto anterior, cuando el narcotrafico empez6 a secuestrar periodistas en una racha imprevisible.</p>
<p>Fue un temor certero. Aunque el Parque Nacional le habia parecido desierto cuando miro por encima del hombro antes de entrar en el automovil, ocho hombres la acechaban. Uno estaba al volante de un Mercedes 190 azul oscuro, con placas falsas de Bogota, estacionado en la acera de enfrente. Otro estaba al volante de un taxi amarillo, robado. Cuatro, con pantalones vaqueros, zapatos de tenis y chamarras de cuero, se paseaban por las sombras del parque. El septimo era alto y apuesto, con un vestido primaveral y un maletin de negocios que completaba su aspecto de ejecutivo joven. Desde un cafetin de la esquina, a media cuadra de alli, el responsable de la operacion vigilo aquel primer episodio real, cuyos ensayos, meticulosos e intensos, habian empezado veintiun dias antes. </p>

A1 despertar de un desmayo que duro mas de tres dias, Evita tuvo al fin la
certeza de que iba a morir. Se le habian disipado ya las atroces punzadas en el
vientre y el cuerpo estaba de nuevo limpio, a solas consigo mismo, en una
beatitud sin tiempo y sin lugar. Solo la idea de la muerte no le dejaba de doler.
Lo peor de la muerte no era que sucediera. Lo peor de la muerte era la blancura,
el vacio, la soledad del otro lado: el cuerpo huyendo como un caballo al galope.
<p>Aunque los medicos no cesaban de repetirle que la anemia retrocedia y que en un mes o menos recobraria la salud, apenas le quedaban fuerzas para abrir los ojos. No podia levantarse de la cama por mas que concentrara sus energias en los codos y en los talones, y hasta el ligero esfuerzo de recostarse sobre un lado u otro para aliviar el dolor la dejaba sin aliento.</p>
<p>No parecia la misma persona que habia llegado a Buenos Aires en 1935 con una mano atras y otra adelante, y que actuaba en teatros desahuciados por una paga de cafe con leche. Era entonces nada o menos que nada: un gorrion de lavadero, un caramelo mordido, tan delgadita que daba lastima. Se fue volviendo hermosa con la pasi6n, con la memoria y con la muerte. Se tejio a si misma una crisali da de belleza, fue empollandose reina, quien lo hubiera creido.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;Tenia el pelo negro cuando la conoci&gt;&gt;, dijo una de las actrices que le dio refugio. &lt;&lt;Sus ojos melancolicos miraban como despidiendose: no se les veia el color. La nariz era un poco tosca, medio pesadona, y los dientes algo salidos. Aunque lisa de pechera, su figura impresionaba bien. No era de esas mujeres por las que se dan vuelta los hombres en la calle: cafa simpatica pero a nadie le quitaba el sueno. Ahora, cuando me doy cuenta de lo alto que volo, me digo: ?donde aprendio a manejar el poder esa pobre cosita fragil, como hizo para conseguir tanta desenvoltura y facilidad de palabra, de donde saco la fuerza para tocar el corazon mas dolorido de la gente? ?Que sueho le habra caido dentro de los suenos, que balido de cordero le habra movido la sangre para convertirla tan de la noche a la manana en lo que fue: una reina?&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Seria quiza el efecto de la enfermedad&gt;&gt;, dijo el maquillador de sus dos ultimas peliculas. &lt;&lt;Antes, por mas base y colores que le pusieramos, a la legua se notaba que era una ordinaria, no habia forma de ensenarle a sentarse con gracia ni a manejar los cubiertos ni a comer con la boca cerrada. No habran pasado cuatro anos cuando volvi a verla, cY que te digo? Una diosa. Las facciones se le habian embellecido tanto que exhalaba un aura de aristocracia y una delicadeza de cuento de hadas. La mire fijo para ver que milagroso revoque llevaba encima. Pero nada: tenia los mismos dientes de conejo que no le dejaban cerrar los labios, los ojos medio redondos y nada provocativos, y para colmo me parecio que estaba mas narigona. El pelo, eso si, era otro: tirante, tenido de rubio, con un rodete sencillo. La belleza le crecfa por dentro sin pedir permiso.&gt;&gt; </p>

SE OYE EL LEJANO retumbo de un galope.
<p>Los rayos del sol caen a plomo sobre el pueblo volviendolo invisible. El caserio no es mas que una mancha opaca en los reflejos. La luz solar empana los colores, aplasta los contornos, borra los horizontes, destine la comba azulada del cielo. El espacio se ha coagulado en la calina blanca. En esta ausencia de luz, por exceso de luz, como en la felicidad excesiva, la muerte no parece estar en ningun sitio. La vida tampoco.</p>
<p>La planicie agrietada en rombos geometricos, casi abstractos, deja manar a traves de las rajaduras la respiracion de la tierra quemada. El vaho seco y caliente, mas liviano que el polvo, acaba mezclandose con el hasta formar una penumbra esmerilada, resplandeciente y oscura.</p>
<p>Es la tiniebla blanca, nebulosa y hambrienta como el deseo. La noche diurna del mediodia que es la hora de nadie asi como la hora de medianoche es la de todos. La hora del amor y del crimen, de las pesadillas, de los violadores, de las estrellas errantes.</p>
<p>Todos somos un poco la oscuridad de la noche en pleno dia. Todos formamos parte de la enfermedad general, llamada vida.</p>
<p>Rajan el silencio los ruidos de la selva asfixiada que siempre esta creciendo en su intento de escapar de la tierra para buscar el aire. Siluetas en llamas se desplazan a saltos como sombras de tigres espectrales. Los monos copulan en la espesura. Se escuchan sus chillidos de un goce delirante, inconsolable. Se diria que no encuentran fuerzas para ayuntarse mas alla del miedo de morir en la copula.</p>
<p>En las casas los hombres duermen boca abajo roncando pesadamente con las manos crispadas sobre los muslos de sus mujeres. Las tramas de tiras de cuero de los grandes camastros rurales dejan gotear el sudor de los durmientes. 5 :;</p>
<p>Maripositas celestes gatean sobre el piso de tierra, bajo las camas, para beber la humedad salada que destilan los cuerpos, irreales en el sueno.</p>
<p>Todas las cosas, incluso la gente, estan como atacadas de una epidemia de apatia, de pasividad, de ensimismado silencio. Es como si cada uno pensara: nada se puede hacer contra la nada.</p>
<p>El moho del fatalismo primitivo crece por dentro.</p>
<p>No tanto en los ninos, esas criaturas de piel agrietada como la tierra. Sus caritas de viejos se han anticipado a sus caras de ninos y las tendran toda la vida por corta que ella sea.Y sin embargo se mueven en una realidad, en un tiempo, distintos al de los adultos.</p>
<p>Alegres, confiados, aislados en un sueno despierto bajo el sol de hierro, juegan a las bolitas y a los trompos, en patios y calles a la sombra raquitica de paraisos y ovenias. Liendres humanas que ignoran por completo el mito de origen de la Tierra sin Mal. </p>

Como ya habra notado, este libro viene acompanado de un compact disc. Asi es
que si usted no dispone de un aparato para escuchar su compact disc, espero
que al menos tenga a la mano una buena vecina o vecino, segun sea el caso,
para pedirle prestado su aparato y poder proceder a la utilizacion del libro.
<p>Se preguntara tambien por que demonios se me ocurrio esta idea. Procedo de inmediato a explicar mis razones.</p>
<p>En esta novela la musica forma parte importante de la trama porque yo estoy convencida de que la musica aparte de provocar estados alterados de conciencia, tiene ei poder de sacudirnos el alma favoreciendo con ello la remembranza. Por tanto, la musica lleva a mis personajes a revivir partes importantes de sus vidas pasadas. Desde que idee la novela quise que mis lectores vieran y escucharan lo mismo que mis protagonistas. La manera que encontre para lograrlo fue por medio de imagenes y sonidos especificos. En el libro se encontrara con partes en las que la narracion se da a traves del comic, sin dialogo. En esas partes usted vera junto al texto un pequeno numero que corresponde al de la pista del compact que se debe escuchar mientras se contemplanas imagenes.</p>
<p>INSTRUCCIONES PARA ESCUCHAR LA MUSICA CLASICA</p>
<p>No puede haber unas instrucciones para todos, pues se muy bien que no todo el mundo esta familiarizado con el mismo tipo de musica. Para empezar hay tres grandes categorias de publico: los que aman la opera, los que nunca en su vida han escuchado opera y los que de plano detestan la opera. En cada caso el procedimiento va a variar como a continuacion se explica:</p>
<p>PARA LOS QUE AMAN LA OPERA</p>
<p>Si usted se encuentra en esta categoria, de seguro no solo conoce muy bien la letra de las arias y los duetos sino que hasta se los sabe de memoria y los tararea en la regadera de vez en cuando. Usted puede ver sin problema las imagenes del comic al mismo tiempo que escucha la musica. Sin embargo, lo unico que le pido es que se olvide por un momento de la historia a la que estas arias originalmente pertenecen. Por ejemplo, si escucha el dueto de amor de Madama Butterfly no lo relacione con el ultimo montaje que vio en Bellas Artes o en el Metropolitan de Nueva York, segun sea el caso, ni piense si en ese momento Butterfly estaba sentada en el piso y con Pinkerton sobre ella, o algo por el estilo. Solo preste atencion a la musica y relacionela con las imagenes del comic hasta que se le ponga toda la piel de gallina. </p>

Ya oigo: &lt;&lt;por aqui&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;por aqui&gt;&gt;. &lt;&lt;Tlamayauhca&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Nite, uica&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;Es aqui.&gt;&gt; Nuestro alrededor sigue totalmente oscuro. Me sorprendo
vociferando. Mis palabras (mudas, no puedo abrir la boca) son un torrente
gritando &lt;&lt; sueltenme! &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt; dejenme ir, dejenme!&gt;&gt;. Gritan desesperadas e
inutiles, no se escuchan. A pesar de su revuelo, alcanzo a oir atras de ellas
&lt;&lt;nite, uica&gt;&gt;. Ya oigo, pero no puedo moverme. Ni los parpados puedo abrir.
Me estoy helando. Debieran cubrirme. Como cargan conmigo como con un
saco inerte al hombro, mi pecho, mi vientre y un lado de la cara sienten la
tibieza del hombre que me lleva, pero en el otro lado de mi cuerpo siento un
frio casi de muerte.
<p>De pronto, el vocerio de adentro se calla y rompe en mi una gana de reir incontenible, igualmente invisible, los musculos no responden. Soy un cuerpo yerto. Ni saberlo me quita la risa. Pero la risa pasa tambien, y consigo despejar un poco la imbecilidad que invadio mi cerebro. Donde vamos? Yo bebi una copa que llevo a mi habitacion solicito un criado, cai en la inconsciencia, y ahora voy aqui, trotando a cuestas de un hombre. Donde me llevan? Con un enorme esfuerzo, abro un poco los ojos. Primero no veo nada. Despues nos acercamos a la luz, seguramente a quien lleva la antorcha. &lt;&lt;Acopca&gt;&gt;, nos dice, y empezamos a subir los escalones. La antorcha se queda atras de mi montura, ilumina un tunel. Nos hemos desplazado bajo tierra. Arriba, me acuestan en los adoquines. Veo el cielo nocturno, cuajado de estrellas. Veo la luna, sonriendo. Me regresa el deseo de reir y mis musculos entumecidos ceden un poco al impulso. Se envalentona la risa y revienta en carcajadas convulsivas que no estallan, mis musculos estan duros como maderos. Ni cuenta me doy de quien me carga.</p>
<p>Cuando han pasado las carcajadas, noto que me han puesto en una cama. Las sensaciones adquieren otro signo, el de la ebriedad. Unas manos tibias me tocan la cara: --Esta helado. Cecmiquiliztli...</p>
<p>Tienen voz de mujer. Me cubren con mantas y frazadas. Las llamas de las velas bailan, todos menos yo se estan moviendo, siento que el mundo gira alrededor de mi. Las manos tibias me acarician la cara. Habla otro, hacia mi. Los brazos de las manos tibias me impiden verlo.</p>
<p>--Recien llegado. Tiene dos dias. Vino con la gente del Capitan, me informe que a acordar desde tierra adentro contrabando. No puede estar aqui por mucho, es frances, se dice que ha tenido tratos con piratas, y si lo se yo lo averigua cualquiera, asi que quienes lo han traido tendran premura porque salga. Es mucho riesgo estar aqui... Luterano, frances, pirata, contrabandista. Muchos motivos para alcanzar la horca y para arrastrar a quienes se le acerquen, ahora que el Virrey busca...</p>
<p>Lo interrumpe otra voz.</p>
<p>--Quien sabe, tal vez hasta es judio. Es facil verlo, ahora que le cambien la ropa. </p>

&lt;&lt;Antes de entrar en el automovil miro por encima del hombro para estar
segura de que nadie la acechaba. Eran las siete y cinco de la noche en Bogota.
Habia oscurecido una hora antes, el Parque Nacional estaba mal iluminado y
los arboles sin hojas tenian un perfil fantasmal contra el cielo turbio y triste,
pero no habia a la vista nada que temer.&gt;&gt;

AUGUSTO ROA BASTOS, nacido en Asuncion en 1917, es una de las
grandes figuras de las letras paraguayas. Muy joven combatio en la Guerra del
Chaco. Luego viajo a Europa como corresponsal de prensa durante la Segunda
Guerra Mundial. A su regreso en 1949, se vio obligado a exiliarse en Buenos
Aires y, a partir de 1975, en Francia. Aunque inicio su carrera literaria como
poeta, son sus cuentos y novelas los que le han dado renombre internacional.
En 1952 publico su primera coleccion de cuentos, El trueno entre las hojas, a la
que siguio la novela Hiyo de hombre (1960), ganadora del concurso
internacional de novelas de Editorial Losada. Entre sus libros posteriores se

<p>BARRY DILLER, of <font size=-1>QVC</font> and Fox Television fame, was one of the first mainstream businessmen to develop a taste for multimedia products. But he said: "We have to resist media imperialism--the tendency to colonise, to define new technologies in terms of the old." His warning has gone unheeded. Too many media companies are producing "shovelware", software that seems designed merely to convince shareholders that the firm's multimedia market share will rise over the next two quarters. This is one of the reasons that some of the pop products are overwrought.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An example of this is Virgin Interactive's "Voodoo Lounge". The Rolling Stones' first foray into the medium is supposed to give us an idea of what it is like to spend time with the band. Its setting is a party where the first person encountered is the bouncer who, after making a few threatening gestures, makes the explorer feel like a <font size=-1>VIP</font>. The idea that this would give anybody a sense of privilege is laughable. In a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> that serves up a group of three-frame animations and the odd bit of second-hand video, the only redeeming feature is the "VoodooRaver", a screen whose psychedelic animations keeps the spectator amused for about two minutes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Zion Train's "Home Grown Fantasy" is just as uninspired, and combines a cheap price (around &#163;8.99) with a cheap result. Its unglossy cardboard cover shows the serene figure of that all-too-familiar five-pronged leaf. The <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> includes much praise for the marijuana plant, "Did-you-know?" statistics and the odd jab at repressive legislation. The rest of the "Seedy-<font size=-1>ROM</font>" program also has a tired feel.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For better value go back to one of the first <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s made by a top rock musician: Peter Gabriel's 1994 piece, "Xplora I". Like "Voodoo Lounge", it has the <font size=-1>VIP</font> angle, though Xplora's visit to a rehearsal (for which the user has to get a pass) gives it an edge. But it, too, has flaws. The session, along with much of the rest of this <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>, is too dependent on video, a medium whose linear nature hinders inter-activity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A good part of "Xplora I" is about the former Genesis singer's global musical taste. On one screen you can click on little coloured balls that represent continents. Each of these balls produces a list of musicians whose music can then be heard. In another part, you have to guess, with the "help" of producer Brian Eno, which performers would sound good with each other. A good guess brings the reward of a little video; a bad guess brings a reprimand from Brian.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At about the same time as "Xplora I", the Residents, a mysterious San Francisco band, teamed up with Voyager and with Jim Ludtke, a <font size=-1>3D</font>-graphic designer, to make the dazzling and humorous "Freak Show". Here the music seems to have been centred around the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> rather than vice versa. The setting resembles a freak show at a Barnum &amp; Bailey circus. It contains all sorts of new life forms. When viewing these (highly impressive) mutants loses its novelty, the explorer can peek into their lives. One freak, the elusive "Herman the Human Mole", has a telephone with ten direct dials, on one of which you hear a husband kill his wife, supposedly because of your call. When you finally find Herman (hiding in a chest of drawers) he reluctantly agrees to tell his life story.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the best pop artist's <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> to date is Laurie Anderson's "Puppet Motel". The always avant-garde work of Ms Anderson is in a league of its own. Like the Residents she has joined forces with a talented computer graphic designer (Hsin-Chien Huang) and the Voyager company.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On her <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> the sense of reality is utterly suspended. The viewer explores the rooms of the puppet motel, if room is the right word. The different areas are perhaps better described as sensory experiences that are not dissimilar to those evoked in using a telephone for the first time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of these rooms contain puzzles, though not of the condescending type that buyers have come to expect from many of the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s on the market. Some are simply playthings. There is a Ouija board, for example. Using a flying revolving widget you can ask yes-no questions. When this reviewer asked about money, the answer was positive, proving that computers can have a kindly heart.

<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
I have been working on this CD-ROM for the past year with a wonderful group
of creative people. I think we've managed to come up with a few new schemes
that open up the stuff we create in such a way that you can explore it from the
inside.
<p>We really wanted to pack it full of ideas. There's over 100 minutes of video, over 30 minutes of audio, more than a book's worth of text and over 100 still images, so there's lots of stuff to play around with and get lost in. Besides giving you the chance to get inside the music and videos and start playing with the material yourself, we think that the interactive pieces should be a lot of fun, so we have devised a few surprises that we hope will lead you on some interesting journeys. </p>

<h2>P<font size=-1>UPPET</font> M<font size=-1>OTEL</font>.<br></h2>

<a href="9bt251.html">Biography</a>
<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
Laurie Anderson has always blurred the boundaries--between performer and
audience, techno and tanglible, ephemeral and real. In the dark spaces of her
imagination shadows race, nebulae swirl, words turn to smoke, electrical outlets
whisper for attention, and time travels both ways. Welcome to Puppet Motel, an
intimate and completely original performance piece on CD-ROM.
<p>Designer Hsin-Chien Huang's amazing spaces shift and dissolve around you, offering ways to join, alter, and record the Anderson experience. Leave messages on the answering machine. Watch videos with a ventriloquist's dummy who performs "Puppet Motel," the hit single from Anderson's ablum Bright Red. Connect the dots to create your own constellation. Ply four juiced- up, electronic violins. Watch the set of the 1995 tour assemble itself as Laurie sits on a virtual stage explaining the development of the show. Familiar Anderson images and tools--telephones, fax machines, Tvs, typewriters, and a glowing, howling electrical outlet at the center--connect you to over an hour of music (including "Down in Soho," which premieres on this CD-ROM), excerpts from Stories from the Nerve Bible, and many strange side trips. There are no right or wrong moves in Puppet Motel. Navigate a world saturated with Laurie Anderson's presence and interact directly with her intelligence and art. </p>

So it is no surprise that Canadian bestsellers flop in the United States. English-speaking Canadians, however, remain fascinated by the elephant next door: more than half of the bestsellers on their list are written by Americans.</p><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The popularity of American bestsellers, in translation, on the Canadian French list is more surprising. So perhaps is the appearance of only two of the bestsellers in France on the Canadian French list: futurology from Microsoft's Bill Gates and a romp through the virtues with Andr&eacute; Comte-Sponville.</p><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Francophone nationalists in Quebec should hesitate before citing this as yet another example of Anglo-American domination of their culture. The divide between the French-speakers on the opposite shores of the North Atlantic is wider than usual. Readers in France are absorbed by books about the presidency of Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand: attacks, exposures, recollections, conversations and muck-raking. No fewer than five of the ten bestsellers in France are about the Socialist who served two seven-year terms as president and died of cancer in January this year.</p><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br><h3>Non-fiction bestsellers<a href="#foot">*</a></h3><ul><li><a href="#usa">United States</a><li><a href="#fra">France</a><li><a href="#cana">Canada (French)</a><li><a href="#canb">Canada (English)</a></ul></td></tr></table><a name="usa"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4>United States</h4><ol><li>Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot <i> by Al Franken</i>. &#160; A comedian on current affairs</li><li>Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus <i> by John Gray</i>. &#160; Relationships</li><li>It Takes a Village <i> by Hillary Rodham Clinton</i>. &#160; Bringing up children by the first mother</li><li>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success <i> by Deepak Chopra</i>. &#160; Serving body and soul</li><li>Emotional Intelligence <i> by Daniel Goleman</i>. &#160; As important as IQ</li><li>The Way of the Wizard <i> by Deepak Chopra</i>. &#160; Spiritual lessons for a happy life</li><li>The Road Ahead <i> by Bill Gates</i>. &#160; Wonder machines</li><li>Time present, Time Past <i> by Bill Bradley</i>. &#160; A political and sporting has-been</li><li>How Could You Do That?

<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
The time is early in the 23rd Century.
<p>Mars has been terraformed and is now politically independent.There are canals and shallow seas that are subject to sudden storms and rapid freezes. It is also warmer than ever with plants and animals specifically engineered for life on the planet. Many of the First Hundred have died and the few remaining are like walking mythological figures to the majority of Martian youth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on Earth there are troubled times. With terminal overpopulation, reduced resources and the bitter nationalism that these problems create, many Terrans see Mars as a potential escape. Thus the safety of the Martian culture depends on the health of Terran cultures on Earth. And so on Mars a campaign is begun which will aid Earth through this difficult time in its history.</p>
<p>Even though the two cultures are politically independent, they are also inevitably intertwined and Mars cannot become dynamically utopian unless Earth does as well...</p>
<p>With the Nebula Award-winning Red Mars, Kim Stanley Robinson started a remarkable trilogy in the grand tradition of the great names of science fiction: Asimov, Bradbury and Clarke. Published to high acclaim it was followed by the hugely successful Green Mars, which went on to win the Hugo Award. Blue Mars marks the end of Robinson's breathtaking history of man's colonisation of Mars. </p>

<p><b>Biography</p></b>
Kim Stanley Robinson was born in 1952. After several years of travelling and
working in different parts of the world, he has-now returned to his beloved
California. Widely regarded as one of the finest new SF writers, Robinson has
won many awards in his career, including the Nebula, Asimov, John W.
Campbell, Locus and World Fantasy Awards. His previous books include The
Wild Shore, The Gold Coast, Pacific Edge and Escape from Kathmandu, and of
course Red Mars and Green Mars. He aslo plans a Mars Companion to

<p><b>...and Mars</b></p>
<h2>Red and green all over?</h2><ul> <li><a href="7ex183.html">B<font size=-1>LUE</font> M<font size=-1>ARS</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Kim Stanley Robinson. <br>
</ul>


<p>IT IS 2127, a bare century after the arrival of the first 100 settlers on Mars. The once inhospitable planet is already a lot more like Earth: pressure at surface level (there being no sea as yet) has risen to around a third of Earth's and plants are taking hold. Administratively, Mars is a post-colonial protectorate under the supervision of the United Nations. But rebellion has flared and Earth cannot respond.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fans of the two earlier books in Kim Stanley Robinson's "Mars" trilogy will rush to read this sequel. And they will not be disappointed. Earth, too, is in turmoil. Global warming has melted ice at the poles, raising sea levels by seven metres and flooding coastlines. Thanks (or no thanks) to an age treatment, human life expectancy is counted in centuries and the population of Earth approaches 15 billion--a thousand times that on Mars. The power of big-business "metanationals" is waning. National identities are returning and local collectives taking root.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Martians exploit these earthly troubles, despite their own abiding fractiousness. They overcome their <font size=-1>UN</font> minders, declare independence and promulgate a constitution, a compromise between preservationist, keep-Mars-rock Reds and progressive Greens who want it "terraformed", that is, wet and lush enough to live without oyxgen bottles and airtight cities. An upper bound for atmospheric pressure is written into the constitution and there is a supreme environmental court.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That all may sound like lightly processed borrowings from academic reports on global competitiveness, Worldwatch papers on population or the environment and "The Debates on the American Constitution, 1787". But the story is told through the characters of some of the "First Hundred"--the unpredictable, clever eccentrics chosen on Earth to colonise Mars. Well past 200 Earth-years old by the novel's end, their age has advantages and drawbacks. They know more than their shallow descendants. But, born into a world where the lifespan was threescore and ten, they are ill at ease with their stretched lives and burdened by over-full memories.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Their ruminations on physics, medicine, ecology, areology (Martian geology), psychology and much else allow the author to show off a wide-ranging curiosity. At times, he sounds a dilettante of the future world. But this is sci-fi (with doses of psy-fi and social-sci-fi) where science does not replace the story, but sets a technical context for bold socio-political speculation. Robots can build just about anything. Venus is being made to rotate so as to make it habitable. To adapt to new atmospheres and gravities, people can alter their genes, taking on traits from other animals. Yet they eat ice-creams at the sea, build houses by hand, commit murder and go fishing. Unlike Ovid's morphed mortals, in sum, they stay human--just.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Read before the two previous books in this trilogy, "Blue Mars" is a bracing, deep plunge into a different past, albeit one set far into the future. Read afterwards, it makes for a gripping continuation.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Mars is free now. We're on our own. No one tells us what to do. Ann stood at
the front of the train as she said this.
<p>But it's so easy to backslide into old patterns of behaviour. Break one hierarchy and another springs up to take its place. We will have to be on guard for that, because there will always be people trying to make another Earth. The areophany will have to be ceaseless, an eternal struggle. We will have to think harder than ever before what it means to be Martian.</p>
<p>Her listeners sat slumped in chairs, looking out of the windows at the terrain flowing by. They were tired, their eyes were scoured. Red-eyed Reds. In the harsh dawn light everything looked new, the windswept land outside bare except for a khaki scree of lichen and scrub. They had kicked all Earthly power of Mars, it had been a long campaign, capped by months of furious action; they were tired.</p>
<p>We came from Earth to Mars, and in that passage there was a certain purification. Things were easier to see, there was a freedom of action that we had not had before. A chance to express the best part of ourselves. So we acted. We are making a better way to live.</p>
<p>This was the myth, they had all grown up with it. Now as Ann told it to them again, the young Martians stared through her. They had engineered the revolution, they had fought all over Mars, and pushed the Terran police into Burroughs; then they had drowned Burroughs, and chased the Terrans up to Sheffield, on Pavonis Mons. They still had to force the enemy out of Sheffeld, up the space cable and back to Terra; there was work still to be done. But in the successful evacuation of Burroughs they had won a great victory, and some of the blank faces staring at Ann or out of the window seemed to want a break, a moment for triumph. They were all exhausted.</p>
<p>Hiroko will help us, a young man said, breakin8 the silence of the train's levitation over the land.</p>
<p>Ann shook her head. Hiroko is a Green, she said, the original Green.</p>
<p>Hiroko invented the areophany, the young native countered. That's her first coricern: Mars. She will help us, I know. I met her. She told me.</p>
<p>Except she's dead, someone else said.</p>
<p>Another silence. The world flowed under them.</p>
<p>Finally a tall young woman stood up and walked down the aisle, and gave Ann a hug. The spell was broken; words were abandoned; they got to their feet and clustered in the open space at the front of the train, around Ann, and hugged her, or shook her hand - or simply touched her, Ann Clayborne, the one who had taught them to love Mars for itself, who had led them in the struggle for its independence from Earth. And though her bloodshot eyes were still fixed, gazing through them at the rocky battered expanse of the Tyrrhena massif, she was smiling. She hugged them back, </p>

<i>Princeton University Press; 265 pages; $29.95 and &#163;22.50</i><br>

<p>EVER since Adam Smith taught that a country could best allocate its resources,
and so maximise its wealth, by trading freely with others, economists have
regarded free trade as superior to protectionism. But, as Douglas Irwin's
historical odyssey shows, discussions of trade did not originate with Smith.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beginning with the ancient Greeks and
travelling via the early Christian thinkers and natural-law philosophers, such as
Hugo Grotius, to the English mercantilists of the 17th century, Mr Irwin
describes the evolution of thinking on trade that occurred before Adam Smith.
Many ancient thinkers were contemptuous of trade, regarding commerce as an
inferior activity. The mercantilists, in contrast, recognised the importance of
foreign trade but felt it should be regulated by the state, largely to achieve or
maintain a favourable balance of exports over imports.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though proponents of free, rather than
regulated, trade existed before Adam Smith, their analysis was unsystematic.
Smith devised a coherent and rigorous analytical framework. The details were
filled in by later classical economists. David Ricardo, for instance, famously
espoused the principle of comparative advantage. This maintains that a country
can benefit from free trade even if it is less efficient than its trading
partners at making everything (though Mr Irwin argues that Ricardo is credited
with greater clarity and insight that he in fact showed).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With these intellectual origins in place, Mr
Irwin proceeds to document and assess the main challenges to free-trade theory.
These include the terms-of-trade argument, which holds that a country can, under
certain conditions, benefit from a tariff improving the ratio at which it
exchanges its products with the rest of the world. Other challenges are weaker,
including the notion that "infant industries" need protective tariff barriers in
order to flourish. All are analysed, weighed and put into context.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Against the Tide" is an impressive
intellectual achievement. As the history of an economic idea it pays less
attention to the political and economic setting in which different theories were
promoted than to their analytical rigour. This purity makes the history a
delightful as well an educational read. It should be a set text for anybody
interested in trade policy.</td></tr></table> <a name="2"></a><table cellspacing=0

WITH President Clinton back in the White House, fundamental tax reform will not be
at the top of America's economic agenda. It was, after all, Robert Dole who
called for a <i>"</i>fairer, simpler, flatter<i>"</i> American tax system.
Nonetheless, the movement for tax reform has gained such momentum that the issue
will remain alive. And, with the help of <i>"</i>Taxing Ourselves<i>"</i>, the
layman will finally be able to understand it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;American taxpayers complain about the
complexities of their current income-tax-based system; economists believe that a
shift towards taxing consumption rather than income would generate higher saving
and so boost America's growth rate. Both have a point: reducing complexity and
increasing savings are good reasons for tax reform. But a careful examination of
the case for change demands a clear understanding of the principles behind
America's existing tax system, its goals and how different proposals would affect
their attainment. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Taxing Ourselves" provides
just that. It describes America's current tax system with admirable clarity, and
then goes on to examine the criteria for choosing between competing systems: the
"fairness" of a tax system, its simplicity and how much it fosters economic
growth. An analysis of the basic building blocks of reform--such as introducing a
single tax rate, removing exemptions and shifting the tax base from income to
consumption--is followed by a critical evaluation of specific reform proposals.
They include a single "flat tax", a value-added tax and a national sales tax. For
anybody interested in tax reform, yet confused by political polemic, "Taxing
Ourselves" is an invaluable guide to the debate..
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those whose interest goes further, the book
from the Brookings Institution extends the analysis. It addresses oft-ignored
details about the economic impact of tax reform: the issues raised, for instance,
by the transition from an income-taxed based system to one centred on consumption
taxes. Would employers have less incentive to provide employees with health
insurance if this benefit were no longer tax efficient? What would happen to
charitable contributions if they could no longer be deducted from taxable income?
This will not be the final word on any of these issues, but it sets the standard
for future debate.</td></tr></table> <a name="3"></a><table cellspacing=0

<p>BETWEEN 1950 and 1972, per capita incomes in Western Europe grew at an average
of 3.8% a year, far faster than at any comparable period in history. In the
subsequent two decades the growth rate more than halved and unemployment
increased sharply. This collection of essays examines both the "Golden Age" and
the less glorious years that followed. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It
stands out from previous analyses of Europe's economic performance for three
reasons. First, it places the post-war experience into a longer historical
context, demonstrating that the "Golden Age" was an exceptional period: later
growth rates are closer to Europe's historical trend. Second, the essays combine
traditional analyses of growth, which emphasise physical capital and increases in
productivity, with newer theoretical insights that place greater importance on
human resources and economic policy. And third, thanks to careful descriptions of
individual countries, the book is richly comparative. The essays are not always
easy, but for those who wish to understand Europe's post-war performance they are
worth the effort.

<p>OTHERS are more loved. The 1975 Columbia may be the best in one volume. But nobody really disputes that the Britannica is not only the largest but also the greatest of encyclopedias, at least in English. Born of the Scottish Enlightenment, it has carved its course, like a big river, across nations. It has grown in breadth, depth and mass, its tributaries feeding every other encyclopedia in the world. In 1920 the Britannica migrated to Chicago and, despite its name and its distinguished list of contributors from across the world, it is now a wholly American publication. Under American ownership editorial standards remain high, though its editors tend naturally to reflect the preoccupations of their own continent more than those of Europe or elsewhere.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Arguments about the many different editions of the Britannica have always been fierce. The 20th-century ones all have passionate critics and defenders. The 11th (1911), a great assemblage of 19th-century learning and certitude shot through with the first stirrings of modern doubt, still has admirers; the 14th, repeatedly revised from 1929 to 1973, kept to the old format of gathering what was deemed worth knowing in one alphabetical list. But balancing science and humanities, English-speaking and other cultures, got ever harder. In 1974, for the radically changed 15th edition, Britannica was split into a Micro- and a Macropaedia, short entries and longer essays. Now Britannica has taken the next giant step, not of content this time but of form, by going electronic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overdue and inevitable as this was, it still has to be asked what advantages Britannica 2.0 has over the 32-volume bound set. Price is one. At &#163;755 the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> version is half as dear as the cheapest print edition and a fifth the price of the "Connoisseur": a misnamed display object bound in leather and stamped with spine lettering in 23-carat gold. Its content, written in clear layperson's language, remains consistently high, offering better value for money than any competitor. The integrity of the publishers cannot be faulted in their decision to keep every one of the 44m words of the print edition, even if this does create visual congestion on a tightly-packed monitor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As if unsure of their wares, other publishers of encyclopedias on <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> have tended to wrap them in warm colours and soft music. It comes therefore as a bit of a shock to load the Britannica disc and watch the words appear in sombre grey. This denial of tint would, however, have delighted the Society of Gentlemen of Scotland who founded the Britannica in Edinburgh 200 years ago, and is bracing in its way. The disc itself is red, a concession to colour as bold as a bishop's purple socks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A vast extension in search capacity is the single biggest advantage of the electronic Britannica. In Britannica 2.0 the user can call up an article by typing a headword into the search box; by listing a string of key words linked to each other with the logical operators "and", "not", "or" and "adj" (for "adjacent") available to help narrow the search; or by posing a written question on screen and clicking for its answer. The last, though tempting, is also the most likely to waste time, after the initial amusement has worn off. The question, "What are the seven deadly sins?", for example, will come up with anger, lust and so on but will point you, for good measure, to Grumpy, Happy and the other dwarfs. On the other hand, it hits a bull's-eye if asked who coined the term "iron curtain". No, not Churchill; Goebbels.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A weakness of the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> version is that only 2,500 remain out of the print edition's 24,000 photographs, drawings and colour plates. The editorial litmus seems to be whether illustration is essential to literal understanding of the text. So instead of a seductive Tintoretto or an aerial view of the Great Rift Valley, you get not one but hundreds of schematic line drawings of mathematical principles: useful, but not crowd-pleasers. Worse still, their captions are almost too small to read unless you go through an elaborate series of hoops in the options menu in the Netscape tool bar to enlarge the size of the print. Also, statistical tables are so long that they flow off the screen, forcing you to grasp on to hundreds of invisible figures to retain the full picture.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Maps, which in the electronic version show only political boundaries, offer an equally stringent memory-test; their title is given, as in the print edition, at the end. So the user has to scroll down screen after screen to follow the course of an (unnamed) river, to be told at the end that it is the Nile. The few colour reproductions that inform us aesthetically are neither listed nor readily accessible. Why, for example, is there a small, under-exposed snapshot of the interior of Amiens Cathedral tucked under "High Gothic", but not linked to the entry on either Amiens or cathedrals? The sad conclusion is that the compilers of this <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> are out of sympathy with the visual possibilities of the medium.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the Britannica 2.0 comes an abridged Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary, a lightweight work whose limited entries follow the old-fashioned lexicographic practice of presenting the earliest (and usually obsolete) definition of the word first and the current meaning last.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is easy to cavil over delays and shortcomings. Rival encyclopedias such as Grolier's went electronic ten years ago. Many parents who once might have bought an expensive encyclopedia spend the money instead on a computer. Britannica's revenues are reported to have dropped sharply. Sales of the encyclopedia in North America alone fell from 117,000 sets in 1990 to 51,000 last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When in April 1995 the parent company in Chicago let it be known that it was seeking an investor or a buyer even, word got out to Microsoft in Seattle that Britannica was, after two centuries of success, near bankruptcy. Bill Gates and his Microsofters were jubilant at what they seem to have believed were a rival's death- throes, convinced that what was bad for Britannica must be good for their "Encarta", even though, by comparison, Microsoft's pathetic encyclopedia is as a box of lego to the Taj Mahal. In fact, Britannica's owners needed money to readjust their sights from the mainstay print edition to a new source of revenue-making, by creating new channels of distribution and product development such as Britannica's Online service on the Internet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another potentially radical change in Britannica's long history began in December, when an American businessman, Jacob Safra, successfully bid for it and won. He soon moved to reassure worriers. "Our goal", he said, "will be global in distribution to all people, all incomes and all ages." And late and under-illustrated as it is, the electronic Britannica looks set for success. Compression technology is moving so fast that with each year more and more elements can be added to the disc. Multi-layered, two-sided discs were developed some time ago. But the equipment needed for them is not yet producible at a market price. But that, too, presumably will change before long.

From Kay Redfield Jamison, an international authority on manic-depressive
illness, a remarkable personal testimony: the revelation of her own struggle
with manic depression since adolescence, and how it has shaped her life.
<p>Vividly, directly, with candour, wit and simplicity, she takes us into the fascinating and dangerous territory of this form of madness - a world in which one pole can be the alluring dark land ruled by what Byron called 'the melancholy star of the imagination', and the other a desert of depression and, all too frequently, death.</p>
<p>Child of a brilliant, mercurial Air Force officer and scientist and a remarkable mother descended from an old New England family, Kay Jamison suffered her first attack of manic depression at seventeen. We follow her battle with the illness through college, through graduate school, through a passionate love affair and desperate loss, through episodes of violence, bouts of madness and attempted suicide. We experience her fear of letting go of the intoxicating highs and her deep-rooted belief that she should weather the illness without medication - a fear that leads her to resist taking lithium, the drug that would ultimately save her life. And, finally, she recounts the slow and painful mastering of her illness through knowledge, courage, medication, self- discipline and the power of love.</p>
<p>A moving and exhilarating memoir by a woman whose furious determination to learn the enemy, to use her gifts of intellect to make a difference, led her to become, by the time she was forty, a world authority on manic depression whose work has helped save countless lives. </p>

</ul>

<p>MANIC-depressive illness kills tens of thousands every year, many of them young, gifted and imaginative people. Byron, Schumann and Virginia Woolf were among the sufferers. So are many members of the medical profession, who have easy access to the means of suicide. Kay Redfield Jamison's book is a devastatingly candid account of her experience of the disease. But the author is no ordinary victim of the illness. As professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University school of medicine in Baltimore, she is able to filter her experience through an intellectual understanding of the condition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From childhood, she was always intensely emotional, given to frightening, although often wonderful, extremes of mood. She experienced her first attack of the disease at 17 and from then on her life became caught up in an unrelenting cycle of mania and depression. These worsened in intensity as she moved into adulthood. She could be violent to others, often people she loved, just as others were necessarily brutal towards her when she was in the full grip of psychosis. "I have been physically restrained by terrible, brute force; kicked and pushed to the floor; thrown on my stomach with my hands pinned behind my back; and heavily medicated against my will."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like so many sufferers, Dr Jamison resisted taking lithium, the elemental salt whose clinical use was discovered by an Australian psychiatrist in the 1940s. The effects of lithium, if used in any quantity, can be overpowering and at times lethal. It killed a number of patients while it was under test although ironically it failed to kill Dr Jamison when she tried to commit suicide by taking a massive dose.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another of lithium's side-effects is that, unless used sparingly (the practice in recent years), it impairs the enjoyment of life. However, the real resistance to lithium comes more from the widespread belief that an effort of will is needed to overcome the illness. This conviction, combined with an addiction to manic "highs", which were like "gliding along the rings of Saturn", is why Dr Jamison resisted taking lithium for many years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She cites the Chinese belief that to conquer a beast you must first find it beautiful and this she has tried to do with her own manic-depressive illness. The story at times makes harrowing reading but the writer has wit and the soul of a poet. She writes, for instance, an exquisitely moving account of a love affair she had with an Englishman, ended by his sudden early death.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She is also generous about the many people who helped along the way. Interestingly, the only ones to come out badly are psychoanalysts, portrayed as humourless, jargon-ridden bigots, although she was greatly helped by psychotherapy. She wisely points to the need to treat the dual aspects of any individual suffering from mental illness-- that is, the brain with medication and the mind with psychotherapy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The book ends with a brief discussion of the research by James Watson, a famous geneticist, into the "troubled helix" that is responsible for manic-depressive illness, a quest for the biological equivalents of quarks and leptons. Mr Watson has gathered up a multidisciplinary team to study the genetic pedigree of affected families. Dr Jamison's brilliant father, for instance, was afflicted with the disease as were many others in his family. You finish the last page feeling that you have shared the author's healing experience.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Into the Sun
<p>I was standing with my head back, one pigtail caught between my teeth, listening to the jet overhead.The noise was loud, unusually so, which meant that it was close. My elementary school was near Andrews Air Force Base, just outside Washington; many of us were pilots' kids, so the sound was a matter of routine. Being routine, however, didn't take away from the magic, and I instinctively looked up from the playground to wave. I knew, of course, that the pilot couldn't see me - I always knew that - just as I knew that even if he could see me the odds were that it wasn't actually my father. But it was one of those things one did, and anyway I loved any and all excuses just to stare up into the skies. My father, a career Air Force officer, was first and foremost a scientist and only secondarily a pilot. But he loved to fly, and, because he was a meteorologist, both his mind and his soul ended up being in the skies. Like my father, I looked up rather more than I looked out.</p>
<p>When I would say to him that the Navy and the Army were so much older than the Air Force, had so much more tradition and legend, he would say, Yes, that's true, but the Air Force is the future. Then he would always add: And we can fly. This statement of creed would occasionally be followed by an enthusiastic rendering of the Air Force song, fragments of which remain with me to this day, nested together, somewhat improbably, with phrases from Christmas carols, early poems, and bits and pieces of the Book of Common Prayer: all having great mood and meaning from childhood, and all still retaining the power to quicken the pulses.</p>
<p>So I would listen and believe and, when I would hear the words "Off we go into the wild blue yonder," I would think that "wild" and "yonder" were among the most wonderful words I had ever heard; likewise, I would feel the total exhilaration of the phrase "Climbing high, into the sun" and know instinctively that I was a part of those who loved the vastness of the sky. </p>

SOME sneering wag has already come up with a phrase for it: "pre-millennial tension". Though meant as a put-down, the jibe pulls its punch. Is there something to millennium fever or not? Well, yes and no. As the millennium ends, people across the world are anxious about all sorts of looming calamity. But only a relative handful of calendar-nuts are worried because the millennium is ending.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alarm at approaching dates and fear of impending disasters are not the same thing, as Damian Thompson makes clear in an outstanding book on a much-hyped topic. His main interest is apocalyptic prophecy and he takes it as given that, when calling out "the end is nigh", the more successful prophets are vague on timing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The book goes into the cultural roots of doomsaying and then surveys the current "millennial" ferment, whether date-related or not. It is partly reportage, sweeping up things with only a loose connection: loud, money-grubbing churches in Seoul, fiery horror at Waco, nerve-gas on the Tokyo subway. The book's first, historical half is the more interesting and successful.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Thompson explains how calendars grew out of an early awareness of seasons, how <i>anno domini</i> dating was adopted in Christendom and how a modern sense then emerged of historical time as an unbroken progression. He places the eruptions of apocalyptic fervour which he has studied into their historical context, be it the Middle Ages or the 16th century, and finds that such outbreaks come almost invariably in periods of economic or social upheaval. An enlightened sceptic, he accepts the now common view that the so-called "terrors of 1000" are the invention of a later age. He shows sympathy as well as amusement at famous non-events of 19th-century prophecy such as the Great Disappointment of 1844, when 50,000 Millerites in America waited vainly for the end of time on October 22nd.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In his darker reflections on apocalyptic movements, he leans heavily on a book by Norman Cohn, "The Pursuit of the Millennium" (1957), which treated Nazism and Marxism, not to everyone's satisfaction, as secular forms of "eschatological fantasy". Mr Thompson's feel for the tangle of beliefs and resentments in the "the underground river of New Age ideas" is exemplary. But it is not clear that all-purpose categories such as outsider religion or end-of-an-era anxiety shed much extra light here.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Thompson is at his best looking back. His insight that people in troubled times often over-generalise their condition makes sense. It is easy to see the end of your world as the end of everything. There was always a tension between religious or philosophical ideas of man in abstract at the centre of the cosmos, and tribe-, town- or kin-related notions of particular men, a tension that may survive half-consciously to this day. In Kabbalist tradition, for example, when a person dies, so does a universe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intriguing, too, is what Mr Thompson has to say about Zoroaster, an early Persian prophet with lasting influence whom he identifies as the first known apocalyptic seer. Zoroaster, he recounts, was the main source for Hebrew visions of a time of tribulation and destruction, followed by a new-made perfection--a common pattern, it could be added, for later doomsaying prophecy. It is from Zoroaster, Mr Thompson goes on, that the Manichaean vision of a universe split between warring powers of light and darkness, spirit and matter, descends; and this dualism survives, repressed or absorbed, in Christianity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A sense of alternative traditions resurfacing runs through Harold Bloom's brilliant, idiosyncratic study of millennial omens. Mr Bloom, who is one of America's foremost literary scholars, embarks here on what he calls a "spiritual autobiography", a mutable venture drawing in the Romantics, Shakespeare, Kabbalists, Sufis and Freud among many others. Gnostic visions of a universe from which the creator has absented himself interest Mr Bloom in particular. His view is that <i>gnosis</i>--the conviction of direct contact with God--springs from the repeated failure of promised apocalypse. America, to Mr Bloom, is a nation of prophecy, and of powerful gnostic leanings. He cites a survey showing that more than two-thirds of its inhabitants believe in angels and that almost a third claim direct experience of the divine. Though often hard to follow, Mr Bloom's latest book is full of dazzling insights and unexpected connections.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The title of "Fins de Si&egrave;cle: How Centuries End" is a bit of a cheat. These seven essays, written from a British perspective, examine the turn of each century from 1400 to 2000, only to show that centuries end in no special way. Widespread celebration of centenaries is a modern habit. Appealing to a non-existent tradition and mainly to assert Rome's primacy, an embattled Pope Boniface VIII did call a jubilee in 1300. But the French king had him beaten up and deposed soon after; the papacy was then removed to Avignon and for the next several centuries, even on return to Rome, was in no condition to celebrate much of anything. Until the 19th century, new year was marked at widely different dates even within western Christendom. Before then the approach of double-zero years was rarely taken either as a sign of an era ending or as a cause for general foreboding. The very phrase "fin de si&egrave;cle" came into use little more than 100 years ago, initially to describe a rather local mood of lassitude among a set of refined Parisians. About the zeroes at least, you can relax.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
THE 1390S
The Empty Throne
<p>Paul Strohm</p>
<p>The king's seat, with cloths of gold and estate royally apparelled, [was] empty, without anyone presiding or occupying it.</p>
<p>People living in England in the 1390s may not have thought much about the century's approaching end. This unawareness had nothing to do with the state of bovine ignorance sometimes attributed to the middle ages. Nor did it result from any tampering on the part of the much maligned 'medieval Church' - an institution often regarded from our vantage point as narrow and oppressive, but in fact highly varied internally and diffuse in impact. Rather, the great majority of medieval people, including a good many educated ones, simply understood time differently than how we do today. It was perceived not as a continuous flow from the birth of Christ to the present, but as being divided into discontinuous units according to the reigns of kings and the seasons of the liturgical year.</p>
<p>Rather than considering the present as a year in a sequence - 1399, for example - the medieval person would have dated the year in terms of the present king's reign; in this case, the twenty-third year of King Richard, second of that name since the conquest. The battle of Crecy was, by this standard, fought not in 1346 but in the twentieth year of Edward, now king, third of his name since the conquest. Similarly interruptive to a sense of consecutive time were the reckonings of days and hours. Weeks and days were normally measured by the liturgical calendar. Henry IV's deposition of Richard II occurred on Monday of the feast of St Michael the Archangel (rather than on 29 September), and Henry IV's coronation was (symbolically) held on the day of the translation of St Edward, king and confessor (rather than on 13 October). Clocks were a rarity, and most of those in existence were astrological, measuring the movements of the heavens rather than the hours of the day.2 Thus people were as likely to identify the time of day by an adjacent liturgical service, such as prime or lauds, as by a particular hour.</p>
<p>The practice of framing time within a king's reign or a sacred holiday or a liturgical ceremony disposed the medieval English to consider historical correspondences and repetitions rather than to assess the rate of progress to an unknown future. To be sure, a handful of learned people - mostly literate clerics and theologians - operated within a sense of the calendar year. The practice of dating from the birth (or, alternatively, the incarnation) of Christ was devised by a Scythian monk in Rome during what would be known by his calculations as the sixth century.3 So some ecclesiastically oriented chroniclers and historians knew the last year of Richard II and the first year of Henry IV as 1399 in a sequence dating from the birth of Christ, and were aware that a new century was impending. This knowledge was undoubtedly shared, but very unevenly, among some segments of the populace as a whole.</p>
<p>Supposing that few and scattered residents of England would have paused to mark the passing of 1399 into 1400, a remarkable paradox remains. Even if few knew of the century's passing, most of them acted as if they did. In 1399 a king who had reigned for twenty-three years, son of the revered Black Prince and last direct heir of the Plantagenets, was deposed and replaced. Rival popes - one in Rome supported by the English and Germans and another under French protection in the 'sinful city of Avignon' - vied for control of the Church and branded each other supporters or incarnations of the Antichrist. Bogged down at the midpoint of its fruitless Hundred Years' War with France, England faced active military pressure from the kingdom of Scotland, insurgence in English-dominated sections of Ireland, and the imminence of a bloody and decade-long rising in Wales. </p>

Fins de Siecle How Centures End, 1400-2000
<p>Edited by Asa Briggs and Daniel Snowman</p>
<p>As we approach the new millennium, we find ourselves reassessing the past and looking forwards to a new future. Has the prospect of a new century always provided a 'sense of an ending'? In this timely and stimulating book, experts on each century since the fourteenth explore the characteristics of history's final decades and find that a consciousness of time has indeed influenced the way people perceive their place in the past.</p>
<p>The writers - Paul Strohm on the 1390s (when signs of a new time consciousness first emerged), Malcolm Vale on the 1490s, Ian Archer on the 1590s, Peter Earle on the 1690s, Roy Porter on the 1790s and Asa Briggs on the 1890s and 1990s - discuss what is common and what is distinctive to each period. Investigating cultural and intellectual attitudes, economic and technological developments, and artistic, scientific and political change, they capture the atmosphere of each end of century. As well as the great watersheds of history, the authors explore the daily lives of ordinary citizens, recounting personal histories and subtle shifts in diet fashion and design, sex and gender roles, relations between rich and poor and the emergence of language. Illustrations from both high and popular art provide arresting images of the cultural and social fabric of each community.</p>
<p>The year 2000 will be the first millennium humankind has consciously experienced: we look back not a hundred but a thousand years, and in looking back we are better prepared to plan ahead. From the apocalyptic vision of medievalJudgement Day sermons to the decadence of the currentfin de siecle, from the invention of printing to cloning and computerisation, this book is a pertinent guide to the future as well as to the past. </p>

<h1>In the mirror of the 1960s</h1>
<p><b>Today's anti-government liberals have a lot more in common with old-fashioned 1960s radicals than you might think</b></p><ul> <li>R<font size=-1>EASSESSING THE</font> S<font size=-1>IXTIES</font>.</a>&nbsp;  Edited by Stephen Macedo. &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i> Norton; 320 pages; $25.</i> <br>

</ul><ul></ul>


<p>"FREEDOM'S just another word for nothing left to lose," rasped Janis Joplin, and all those listening knew her song was about more than a lost lover. For the young radicals of the sixties were not only, or even chiefly, interested in gaining more liberty--or licence, as their critics would have it. They were also committed, often in confused and sentimental ways, to the ideals of equality and fraternity--collaborative values which put limits on individual freedom.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The raggedness of the advances and the retreats on these three fronts--liberty, equality and fraternity--help explain why so many veterans from either camp of the counter-cultural wars in that rebellious decade are convinced that their side lost. In his introduction to "Reassessing the Sixties", George Will, a conservative journalist, sums up the puzzle:
<ul><font size=-1>So, then, who won?...Politically--or, more precisely and narrowly, in the contest for political offices--the right has won. But conservatives are not happy because they sense the primacy of cultural forces and feel that the culture is still shaped by the forces that have lost in electoral politics, by people who believed what the left believed in the sixties.</font></ul>
By and large, he is right. Today's anti-government neo-liberals, who laud personal responsibility and abjure prejudice against gays, blacks or anybody else are, in a sense, the children of 1960s radicals. That, however, is not how most of the leftist veterans see it--at least not in America, if the recent spate of books about the sixties is any guide. The sweet longing for the hedonism of the period (swinging London, the Beatles, Mary Quant and so on) that keeps breaking through in a mainly British collection of pieces edited by Ray Connolly finds no echo in the set of earnest American essays edited by Stephen Macedo.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America, the sixties is shorthand not for the decade that began in 1960 with the election of President Kennedy, but for the 11 years that began with his assassination in 1963 and ended in 1974 after America's forced withdrawal from Vietnam and President Nixon's resignation to escape impeachment for perjury in the Watergate scandal. Between these dates, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and several civil-rights activists were shot dead, rioters set city blocks ablaze and colleges were racked by protests against the draft, the Vietnam war and "the military-industrial complex" that sustained it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Young intellectuals, mainly academics or college students, were in the van of the counter-cultural revolution on both sides of the Atlantic, but their efforts at coalition-building were different. In Europe they tried to make common cause with the working class but achieved much greater success in the east than in the west.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;French workers were quickly persuaded by wage increases to end their general strike during the 1968 student rebellion. At its high point some 20,000 students had marched through the Latin Quarter of Paris in "the Night of the Barricades". Danny Cohn-Bendit, an <i>enrag&#233;</i> from the University of Nanterre (now a Green politician in Frankfurt), was speaking less the language of the organised working class than that of libertarian anarchy when he shouted through a bullhorn: "There are no marshals and leaders today! Nobody is responsible for you! You are responsible for yourselves."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The effort to unite intellectuals and workers fared better in Eastern Europe, especially in Alexander Dubcek's Czechoslovakia during the "Prague Spring". There, Paul Berman recalls in "A Tale of Two Utopias", they won broad support when they championed the young, humanistic Marx against the old, iron-laws-of-history Marx, Hegel against Engels, Lenin against Stalin, left-wing humanism against "scientific" leftism, artists and intellectuals against office-clerks and censors, the avant-garde against the party-mandated arts.</p>
<p><b>American exceptionalism</b></b>
<br>In the accounts of the rebellions of the sixties in America, the workers and their unions hardly merit a mention. By then, as David Burner notes in "Making Peace with the 60s", it was almost impossible to discover any visible radicalism within the American social-democratic tradition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was a heritage that had once flourished among western farmers, Kentucky coal miners, and the militants of Little Steel. In the era of the Great Depression of the 1930s, writers, artists and intellectuals had been drawn to sharecroppers, migrant workers and union organisers. But 30 years later they saw white working men mainly as reactionary rednecks keeping blacks out of white schools in the south and as blue-collar workers keeping blacks out of white jobs in the rest of the country.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The intellectual left and the radicalised students, regarded by the average Joe as over-educated and over-privileged, sought instead to make common cause with the civil-rights movement. It was an uneasy alliance. The civil-righters were led by ministers of evangelical churches, charismatic men who almost alone among southern blacks were not beholden to whites for their income and security. It is the break-up of this alliance that Mr Burner views as the great tragedy of the sixties. For, as he sees it, the civil-rights movement "took a wrong turn as it gradually came to emphasise the 'identity politics' of race and ethnicity at the expense of the vastly more important politics of class and distribution of wealth".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first fracture in the loose coalition of what were then called progressive forces came between the Negro civil-rights movement, which welcomed white allies, and the Black Power movement, which despised them. The Black Power folk split in turn over whether the goal was to be black capitalism, African communalism or some kind of Marxist Utopia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Further fragmentation followed on the left. Harvey Mansfield notes in his essay in "Reassessing the Sixties" how feminism began partly as a reaction against the male chauvinism of the sexual revolution. Were women, the feminists asked, to be liberated from the kitchen and the nursery only to be confined to the bedroom? Within a decade, says Jeremy Rabkin in his essay in the same book, some feminists, in attacking pornography as the promotion of violent and degrading attitudes towards women, were campaigning for censorship.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Berman examines the fragmentation of the Gay Liberation Front, a shard of the counter-cultural revolution whose ecumenism once permitted the inclusion of both men and women. First the women split off into a Women's Caucus, then black and Hispanic women split off into their own group, and finally the Hispanic women left this to form Las Buenas Amigas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In their wacky desire to shock, it often seemed as if radicals were afraid that conservatives might be running short of ammunition and were obliging them by keeping up the supply. Yet the labels "radical" and "conservative" here are deceptive. Conservatism is a broad church which includes economic liberals and political or cultural traditionalists. Culturally speaking, yesterday's left-wing radicals and today's right-wing libertarians have much more in common than often supposed. Which, when you think about it, is not all that surprising. They have both been moulded by the same social changes: the weakening of the father-dominated family, and of authority figures generally; the success of education in undermining hierarchies and patterns of deference; the spread of wealth dissolving class barriers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite their excesses and absurdities, and their wholly predictable failure to create a more collaborative society, the rebels of the sixties were a symptom of sweeping social change in the developed world--and mainly for the better. In Eastern Europe, the heirs to Alexander Dubcek are in power in several former communist lands. In Western Europe, deference, if not routed, is in full retreat. In America, it is now unthinkable that any mainstream politician would oppose legislation to desegregate hotels, motels, restaurants and other public accommodations, as Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan and George Bush did in denouncing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Visible integration among characters in television dramas, integrated entertainment and integrated television news teams today appear ordinary and normal. But, Mr Burner notes, this is only because the civil-rights movement challenged the discriminatory practices that were previously regarded as ordinary and normal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Censorship has all but gone, despite the feminist backlash. It is hard, in the 1990s, to comprehend how D.H. Lawrence's "Lady Chatterley's Lover" was banned in Britain until 1960, and William Burrough's "Naked Lunch" was prevented from being published in full in the United States until 1966. Much discrimination against women and homosexuals has fallen away.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Above all, as Todd Gitlin notes in the concluding essay in "Reassessing the Sixties", on every political and cultural front today, "the question is not whether to question authority but which authority to question". It is not the epitaph that the Woodstock Nation would have wished for the decade, but it is no mean achievement all the same.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
INTRODUCTION
<p>When Harold Macmillan spoke in Cape Town on 5 February 1960 of the 'wind of change' he was, of course, talking about the continent of Africa where the growth of national consciousness was then sweeping away the vestiges of the European empires. But had he been speaking more generally about the decade which was just beginning, he could hardly have chosen a more apposite expression. Because by the beginning of the 1960s a wind of change was blowing everywhere, not just in Africa but across Europe and North America and even eventually into the Soviet empire. Indeed the era of the Sixties was about nothing so much as change; not change from the outside or by conquest, but change from within.</p>
<p>And there was more than that. As well as change, the Sixties' ethos was also about optimism, the belief that things could, should and would be changed for the better, because that was the right thing to do. There was, in short, a new idealism about, conceived in a time of shared privation and now funded by a sustained period of peace and greater prosperity than the world had ever known. After a great depression, six years of world war, and fifteen more of austerity a new generation was coming of age to live the dreams of their parents.</p>
<p>So far as Britain is concerned it has always seemed to me that the attitudes which shaped the Sixties were largely forged during the Second World War, with the Beveridge Report of 1942 and the 1944 Education Act as midwife and wet-nurse. The changes sought there represented idealism of the highest order. In health and education there was for the first time a national plan to nurture what the Liberal Democrats would today call the nation's greatest natural asset. The plan worked. By 1960 a generation of achievers, bred on notions of fairness and opportunity, was able to take advantage of the unlimited possibilities which were suddenly becoming available. This was something new.</p>
<p>Looking back it now almost seems as though everything happened at once. While the abolition of national service in 1960 was, in effect, adding two extra years to the young life of every boy (thus releasing all kinds of energies), Britain's loss of Empire meant that a whole class of educated young Britons was being forced to look closer to home for careers. Everywhere the barriers of class and social conformity were being examined and, in the need to fill jobs with qualified personnel, pushed aside. The contagion of a fairer society was spreading quickly, promptly demonstrated when Princess Margaret married a commoner (who was also a photographer!). There were more university places chasing fewer students than ever before, and Lady Chatterley's Lover was judged not pornographic when a jury, asked if they would wish their servants to read such a book, voted against the nation's artistic game-keepers and in favour of the individual's common sense. In 1961 the birth control pill became available on prescription for the first time, in the United States the Peace Corps, under President Kennedy, was founded and in London Beyond The Fringe opened, followed a few months later by the first edition of Private Eye. In November of that year That Was The Week That Was went on television, ending the BBC's traditional ban on jokes about religion, politics, royalty and sex. Then came the Beatles, and the Sixties had its troubadours.</p>
<p>Certainly it is the look and sounds we most readily associate with the Sixties now - the geometric Mary Quant look, the Muhammad Ali travelling circus, the pirate radio stations, Julie Christie's performance in Darling, Michael Caine's in Alfe, and Mandy Rice Davies's in the dock of the Old Bailey. But there was much else happening, a redefining of attitudes which today we take for granted. In 1965 the death penalty was abolished and the Race Relations Board set up. Two years later, in the same month that Sergeant Pepper was celebrating flower power, two bills, one legalizing abortion, the other homosexuality between consenting adults, were reaching the statute book. Three months earlier the nation's first Ombudsman had begun work, and breath tests had been introduced.</p>
<p>With almost full employment (there was great consternation when in 1966 the jobless total rose past the half million mark) it never occurred to anyone that there might not be a job waiting after education was completed. And because there were jobs there was the opportunity to fail, which is one of the best ways of learning. In 1965 when BBC2 began, after a very short planning period, it almost doubled BBC Television's output overnight, and a whole generation of young producers and directors were suddenly given that opportunity. Not many failed.</p>
<p>There was an impudence about the time. My own generation of war babies had grown up cowed by the success of America, the country which had been so recently the friendly invader. In some respects perhaps we imagined ourselves secondhand Americans. Everything that was new and exciting seemed to happen in America first. But in the Sixties all that changed. There was a new mood in Britain reflected on a global scale by the Beatles, and winning the World Cup in 1966 didn't hurt national morale either. For a while, crazily, everything seemed possible. Little wonder that by the end of the decade a man was walking on the moon.</p>
<p>The juggernaut of change and endless possibility was exhilarating: the Clean Air Act of 1956 was banishing the great London smogs, a British film, Lawrence of Arabia, won seven Oscars, a grammar school boy in Edward Heath was voted leader of the Conservative Party for the first time, and by the end of the decade Concorde was making her maiden flight. While there was considerable disquiet at Britain's selling of arms in the Biafran War, and violence at demonstrations in Grosvenor Square against the Vietnam War, Britain was not psychologically being ripped apart by war and assassination as was America. And although 1969 saw the beginning of the troubles in Northern Ireland it was not until the Seventies that sectarian violence became an everyday occurrence.</p>
<p>Nor was the acceleration of change limited to Britain. In ten years the non- violent Civil Rights movement made extraordinary strides in the United States, while 1968 look students to the barricades in Paris and brought the early, (and sadly, ultimately unhappy) flowering of the Prague Spring. (The fact that it seemed possible for change to be non-violent in a totalitarian system owed much to Sixties' attitudes, even if the Czechs did eventually have to wait a further twenty-one years for democracy.)</p>
<p>And then there was sex . . . The pill inevitably changed everything, although not, I suspect, quite so universally quickly as legend would have us believe. For those at the heart of things, in the media, the universities, the arts, yes, attitudes somersaulted </p>

The Moral History of the Baby Boom Generation
<p>Every few decades, a pure flame of political rebellion shoots up somewhere and with amazing speed spreads in all directions, until half the countries on earth have been scorched.</p>
<p>The first time such a thing happened was in the American Revolution of I776, though in that instance the flame, spreading with less than amazing speed, took thirteen years before reaching as far away as France. But then, yes, the main ideas of the American and French revolutions went leaping fairly quickly across whole regions of Europe and even into the distant exotic zones of colonial Latin America, until a good many countries on three continents were undergoing republican agitations and experiments with constitutional government, which was a wildly revolutionary thing to have happen. A clearer example of the same phenomenon took place in 1848. An insurrection broke out in Paris. That time the uprising invoked the ideals of liberal nationalism and hinted at socialism, too--and within a few months, powerful movements affirming those same ideas swept across Germany, the Austrian Empire, Italy, Spain, and several other countries, not always with the same heat or intensity. A few radical sparks spread all the way to the United States. A republican uprising shook the Seneca nation of America in I848, which is odd to consider. The first convention for women's rights assembled in upstate New York. </p>

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
SEGREGATION, sensible people in the South and elsewhere insisted at
midcentury, would not yield to demonstrations or to court decrees. On that,
President Dwight Eisenhower was of the same mind as Adlai Stevenson, his
Democratic party opponent in the elections of 1952 and 1956. You can't
legislate morality: so went the inevitable cliche. Americans saw themselves as a
people eminently practical in their prosperous economic and political order.
Being practical was a matter of ratifying the given, the familiar, the obvious,
thinking within the well-established conventions of their country's politics and
social relations that appeared to the majority to work so well.
<p>Common sense of this sort sanctions much social evil. In this country it has shielded, among other things, slavery and then segregation. And so what dissolved when black college students sat down at lunch counters reserved for whites, or when the invisible barrier of segregation around a public drinking fountain crumbled, was not only a particular local custom. Vanished also was racial reality itself as people sensible according to their own definition had seen it. And beyond that, civil rights demonstrators were confronting, confusing, and putting to rout the mentality that thinks only by conventions. Much of the rebelliousness of the later 1960s would challenge one or another of the self- satisfied and lethal certainties of political discourse: the abiding conviction, for example, that open resistance to the prosecution of a war is unpatriotic. In this as in many other ways, the rights movement was a prelude to the decade.</p>
<p>It was not only, or even mainly, the physical mixing of races in the South that defied the status quo. The transforming fact, rather, consisted in the way a racial practice was ended. When members of the subject race, instead of waiting for favors from the white caste, simply brushed aside one offensive custom after another, therein began the obliteration of whatever psychological dominance the white community had ever wielded, and whatever sense of mastery it had ever enjoyed.</p>
<p>Nor were most civil rights activists so naive as to see officially decreed segregation as the essence of racial oppression. Segregation was, rather, a component and underpinning in a range of social conditions stretching from inherited poverty to private discrimination in hiring, from the largest institutional arrogance to the slightest personal act of white insolence. Segregation was the most visible instrument of white supremacy, and in denying access to the economic resources that whites monopolized it was among the most effective. The 1954 decision of the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka explicitly defined segregation as illegal in public schools, and the implications of the Court's reasoning defined it as illegal whenever state or local government imposed it on public accommodations. Later in the 1960s, as segregation in public spaces was becoming obsolete, the rights movement would confront racial injustice in its more stubbornly entrenched economic and social forms. </p>

FEW ERAS have captured the imagination quite like the Sixties. Fuelled by
growing prosperity, optimism and sheer youthful cheek, it was overwhelmingly
a period of change - in politics, music and arts, but most of all in attitudes. For
a generation brought up on postwar idealism everything seemed possible for
those who questioned the status quo: from the Beatles to satire, mini-skirts,
John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps, the legalization of homosexuality and abortion,
the Pill, the Civil Rights victories in the United States, England winning the
World Cup, flower power, and on to the first man on the Moon.
<p>Equally there was the darker side: the massacre at Sharpeville, the escalating war in Vietnam, the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King, the Moors murders, the Six Day War, the extinguishing of the Prague spring by Warsaw Pact tanks, the disaster of Aberfan.</p>
<p>A time of startling news stories and fascinating cultural shifts, it was, fittingly, perhaps, in the last decade when the words usually arrived before the television pictures, also an era of great writing.</p>
<p>In The Sixties is a collection of such writing: there is Graham Greene in Papa 'Doc's' Haiti; Alistair Cooke at the funeral of Martin Luther King; Hugh McIlvanney at Muhammad Ali's training camp; Kenneth Tynan at the Lady Chatterley trial; Jilly Cooper at the office Christmas party; William Rees-Mogg on Mick Jagger's drug conviction; Nicholas Tomalin witnessing casual murder in a gunship over Vietnam; and John Lennon's fateful admission to Maureen Cleave that the Beatles were bigger than Jesus.</p>
<p>Then there are the interviewers - Hunter Davies on Paul McCartney and Noel Coward, Jocelyn Stevens on Harold Macmillan, Francis Wyndham on P.J. Proby; the humourists Michael Frayn, Christopher Booker, John Mortimer, Alan Coren and Auberon Waugh; and the great reporters - Max Hastings in Northern Ireland, James Cameron in Israel and David Leitch under siege with the US Marines at Khe Sanh.</p>
<p>The world of the Sixties was often turbulent and frequently dazzling. Here, in a collection of stunning and diverse articles, the best of Sixties journalists recapture brilliantly the texture of the decade as it happened. </p>

A Tale of Two Utopias is the story of the generation of 1968--not the whole
story (which could never squeeze into a single book), but four representative
episodes.
<p>It is the story of student radicalism in the years around 1968--in America and around the world. The story of gay liberation and of modern identity politics-- from their origins in the American New Left to the present. The story of the '68ers in the Eastern bloc--and how in 1989, in Czechoslovakia, the '68ers overthrew Communism. And it is the story of the thinkers in America and France who have lived through these events, the leftism of 1968 and the liberal revolutions that broke out in 1989--and have debated their meaning.</p>
<p>Andre Glucksmann and the New Philosophers of Paris, Tom Hayden and Students for a Democratic Society, the Gay Liberation Front, Frank Zappa, Vaclav Havel and the Velvet Revolution, Francis Fakuyama and his "End of History"--those are the faces and figures of A Tale of Two Utopias. </p>

<h2>M<font size=-1>AKING</font> P<font size=-1>EACE WITH THE</font> 60s.<br></h2>

<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
David Burner's panoramic history of the 1960s conveys the ferocity of debate
and the testing of visionary hopes that still require us to make sense of the
decade. He begins with the civil rights and black power movements and then
turns to nuanced descriptions of Kennedy and the Cold War, the counterculture
and its antecedents in the Beat Generation, the student rebellion, the poverty
wars, and the liberals' war in Vietnam. As he considers each topic, Burner
advances a provocative argument about how liberalism self-destructed in the
1960s. In his view, the civil rights movement took a wrong turn as it gradually
came to emphasize the "identity politics" of race and ethnicity at the expense of
the vastly more important politics of class and distribution of wealth. The
expansion of the Vietnam War did force radicals to confront the most terrible
mistake of American liberalism, but that they also turned against the social
goals of the New Deal was destructive to all concerned.
<p>Liberals seemed to rule in politics and in the media, Burner points out, yet they failed to make adequate use of their power to advance the purposes that both liberalism and the left endorsed. And forces for social amelioration splintered into pairs of enemies, such as integrationists and black separatists, the social left and mainline liberalism, and advocates of peace and supporters of a totalitarian Hanoi.</p>
<p> Making Peace with the 60s will fascinate baby-boomers and their elders, who either joined, denounced, or tried to ignore the counterculture. It will also inform a broad audience of younger people about the famous political and literary figures of the time, the salient moments, and, above all, the powerful ideas that spawned events from the civil rights era to the Vietnam war. Finally it will help to explain why Americans failed to make full use of the energies unleashed by one of the most remarkable decades of our history. </p>

<p><b>The human figure</b></p>
<h2>Always in vogue</h2><ul> <li>T<font size=-1>HE</font> E<font size=-1>VOLUTION OF</font> A<font size=-1>LLURE</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By George Hershey.   &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i> Press; 236 pages; $30 and &#163;19.95</i> <br>
</ul>



<p>SIX foot tall and weighing seven stone is not everybody's ideal of feminine beauty. It nonetheless excited the editors of the British version of <i>Vogue</i>. They filled several pages of a recent issue of their magazine with pictures of a model on this skeletal side of slender. The photographs caused a brief fuss when a watch-making company threatened to pull its advertising in protest. It and other objectors argued that <i>Vogue'</i>s impressionable young readers would starve themselves to achieve the emaciation so elegantly depicted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is the sort of fracas that tickles George Hershey, an art historian at Yale University. In "The Evolution of Allure", he describes how people have been striving for millennia to make their lives imitate what they see depicted in art. His strong thesis goes beyond simple imitation to encompass evolutionary strategy: "Figure art", he writes, "has urged us to breed...for beauty." Artists selected as models people who appealed to their taste. Their depiction of certain features and physiques helped, in turn, to mould people's ideas of beauty and to persuade them to seek partners who conformed to the archetypes. The loop was tightest in the classical period from the fifth century <font size=-1>BC</font>, and again during the Renaissance, when the canon of bodily proportions that was exemplified by the classical sculpture of Polykleitos was rediscovered and further elaborated.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ancient depictions of figures show very varied physiques, from bulbous carved goddesses to willowy hunters in cave paintings. The art of the 20th century has similar variation: Mr Hershey strikingly juxtaposes illustrations of the ancient works with a lolling Lucian Freud nude and some spindly Giacometti walkers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But between about 450<font size=-1>BC</font> and 1900 sculpture and painting in the West kept great regularity. The nipples, navel, groin, knees and heels of Polykleitos's Spear Bearer can be measured off down his body in multiples of head lengths: 2, 3, 4, 5.5, 7; Michelangelo's David is almost the same, except his knees are exactly 5 head-lengths down. Canons of proportion became immensely complicated, ordering the ratios of all sorts of bodily measurements, from chin to nose, and throat to hair-roots in systems that were studied and elaborated by the artist-anatomists of the Renaissance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The obsession with the pattern of the well-formed man became more sinister when it merged in the 19th century with physical anthropology. Ill-formation and other outward signs signalled bad character to such anthropometrists as Cesare Lombroso, a particularly ferocious scrutiniser of his fellow man and woman.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lombroso believed that the human race was under threat of regressing to extinction. "Atavists", whose degeneracy was signalled by such evolutionary throwbacks as "enormous jaws, high cheek bones,...solitary lines in the palms...[and] handle-shaped ears", were, according to Lombroso, in the process of out-breeding the nobler, better-formed people in whom humanity's future hopes lay.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Using statistical methods more feeble than a contemporary of Galton's should have employed, Lambroso claimed to prove in "L'Uomo criminale", a book published in 1876, that men with black hair were more atavistically prone to crime than those with blond hair. He saw in art and life evidence that genetic rot had already set in, that atavism was welling up to overwhelm the good breeding work of original heroic races such as the Greeks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lombroso's ideas influenced much art criticism of the late 19th century, including that of Max Nordau, who railed against decadence in artists such as Rodin and Whistler. Nordau was particularly enraged by their portraits of women, in which he saw feral sensuality tempting the viewer to orgiastic degeneration. He favoured taking a stringent line with artists who dallied with such primitive passions, invoking psychiatric hospitals, criminal trials and restrictions on reproduction, both artistic and sexual.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This approach was exuberantly adopted by the Nazis in their programme of eugenic ennoblement (although they did not acknowledge the influence of Nordau, who was Jewish). Once again, art was supposed to present bodily ideals to which healthy human beings would aspire as they selected mates. Bodily proportion became more extreme: the shoulders of the "Aryan" super-heroes in Nazi art are broader in proportion to head size than those of any Renaissance statue; and the women differ more widely from the men than previously, a boosted sexual dimorphism in the manner of birds and animals which go in for great displays.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Hershey's book trots briskly across a lot of history, picking out some shameful low points in science and some rather better art. The breadth of the book allows him to make bold comparisons. Some of its points are made effectively by well-chosen juxtapositions of illustrations: Arnold Schwarzenegger's hemispherical hypermuscles with the multiple plump breasts of an Ephesian Artemis of the 5th century <font size=-1>BC</font>; or Batman with a photograph of a naked man taken by William Sheldon, an American eugenicist who regarded Dick Tracy as a fine "mesomorphic" man.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since this is a work about art, bigger illustrations would have helped, particularly of the complex diagrams of proportion. At least there are a lot of them, but a little more flesh on this rather bony book would have made for even better reading and looking.

"So what's the bad news?" he is asked. "To support a family you'll need three." The joke, which takes various guises, reflects bitterly on the fact that the real wages of American workers have declined continuously over the past two decades.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Between 1948 and 1966 the real hourly wage of "production and non-supervisory" workers in the private sector rose by more than 2% a year. The rate of wage growth then slowed until 1973, when real wages actually started contracting, as they have done ever since. This has gone along with more job insecurity, loss of benefits and the growth of "McJobs".<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How can this extraordinary phenomenon--which threatens the American assumption that the next generation will always be better off than the last--be explained? In "Fat and Mean", David Gordon clears the usual suspects.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The phenomenon cannot be blamed on a "skills mismatch", he claims, because real wages were beginning to fall before the new computer technology became widespread. Although high-school drop-outs have suffered the greatest relative decline in wages, the hourly pay of computer operators and engineering technicians has also fallen. Even the real wages of college graduates are now shrinking. Increased international trade--the so-called global hiring hall--cannot be blamed either, he says. Hourly wages have fallen steeply for workers shielded from foreign competition, such as shop assistants and builders.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gordon finds the answer in bosses' changed attitude to workers. (His point is reinforced by the head of the <font size=-1>AFL-CIO</font> union organisation, John Sweeney, in "America Needs a Raise".) In effect, argues Mr Gordon, an assault on labour began in the early 1970s as a growing big-business lobby--typified by the Business Roundtable--worked to reduce union activity and government interference. (The attack gathered pace after President Reagan sacked striking air-traffic controllers in 1981.)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The business victory has led to a decline in union membership and in the real value of the minimum wage. The fruit of recent economic growth has gone heavily to managers and shareholders. The stick of supervision has replaced the carrot of wage growth. Despite redundancies at companies such as <font size=-1>AT&T</font> and <font size=-1>IBM</font>, America has more managers today than it had in 1989, before downsizing became fashionable.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gordon deplores all this. Having more managers, consuming ever larger amounts of the national income, does not simply depress workers' pay, it is economically inefficient. If workers receive no incentive, productivity growth will decline even further and returns on capital will be depressed. Moreover, poor pay fosters social discontent. Mr Sweeney says discontent is already exploited by xenophobic politicians. Like Mr Gordon, he thinks the answer lies in a revitalised union movement and a higher minimum wage.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The argument has several weaknesses. It ignores the fact that the recent decline in real wages corrects the imbalance experienced after the second world war, when wages grew 10% faster each year than productivity. Mr Gordon's statistics on the numbers of managers are so dubious that his "stick" thesis stays unproven. If productivity gains from a more co-operative approach to labour were so clear and a huge "corporate bureaucratic dividend" was available, it is hard to see why people would not have realised this. Both authors dismiss the idea of a trade-off between high wages and employment. Recent European experience suggests they are wrong.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In their explanation of net employment in American manufacturing between 1972 and 1988, Messrs Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh concentrate on its two determinants: job creation and job destruction. Their findings will change the way economists look at the job market. They reveal an extraordinary amount of activity behind small changes in net employment. Roughly 10% of jobs disappear and reappear within an average year. In recessions this disturbance becomes even more pronounced: job turnover (or reallocation) rises to more than one in five workers.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But they find little correlation between job creation and destruction (the number of new jobs increased in the 1982-83 slump). Nor do they find any relationship between exposure to international trade and job volatility--all industries show high levels of job turnover. They expose as a "myth" the belief that small companies produce more jobs than big ones.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Schumpeterian vein, the authors conclude that "large-scale" business failure and job destruction are normal, probably essential, elements in a successful market economy. It is a controversial interpretation of their findings. The current pace of change appears to be more frenetic than dynamic. The American worker, hurt by falling wages and increasing job insecurity, is its chief casualty.<br><br><p><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845679600,rev">Search</a> &nbsp; -  &nbsp  <a href="http://www.economist.com/review/archive.html">Review Archive</a></p><p><font size=-1><i><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

THE WAGE SQUEEZE
<p>For years Craig Miller had been a sheet-metal worker at a major airline. After he lost his job in 1992, he and his wife--parents of four kids--had to scramble. Craig took on two lower-paying jobs and started a small sideline business. His wife worked nights as a stock clerk. They were patching together, counting his business, four part-time jobs and they were still earning less than half Craig's previous paycheck.</p>
<p>"Sure we've got four jobs," Craig told a reporter. "So what? So you can work like a dog for $5 an hour?"'</p>
<p>The Miller family saga is hardly unique. Since the mid-1970s, more and more U.S. workers and their families have been suffering the wage squeeze, enduring steady downward pressure on their hourly take-home pay. The wage squeeze has afflicted not merely the unskilled and disadvantaged but the vast majority of U.S. households, not merely the poor and working class but the middle class as well. Most people in the United States used to be able to look forward to a future of steadily rising earnings. Now they have to race merely to stay in place.</p>
<p>The wage squeeze has even broader consequences. It not only pinches workers and their immediate families. It sends tremors through entire communities, eroding their stability, ripping their social fabric. The frustration and anger it provokes begins to attack the body politic like a plague, spreading virulent strains of cynicism and discontent, of disaffection from government and hatred toward "others" like immigrants who are often blamed for the scourge. Many observers in the United States are inclined to turn their heads, viewing falling wages as somebody else's problem. But the effects are too far-reaching, too extensive. It won't work to play the ostrich, sticking one's head in the sand. The sand is eroding all around us.</p>
<p>The public receives mixed signals about the wage squeeze. On the one hand, more and more observers have taken note of the vise closing around workers' earnings--citing the pressure to work longer hours, the "disappearing middle class," the increasingly elusive American Dream, the mounting gap between the rich and the poor. Personal stories of declining fortunes abound. Statistical studies of stagnant earnings and soaring inequality have become a growth industry. In my research for this book, finding journalistic accounts and scholarly analyses of the wage squeeze was as easy as following the trail of Newt Gingrich's newfound notoriety.</p>
<p>By late 1995, as I was completing the manuscript, the issue was becoming inescapable. Business Week, often a leader in tracking changes in the economic climate, devoted a cover story to "The Wage Squeeze" in July 1995. Surveying the atmospheric conditions they reported:</p>
<p>Four years into a recovery, profits are at a 45-year high, unemployment remains relatively low, and the weak dollar has put foreign rivals on the defensive. Yet U.S. companies continue to drive down costs as if the economy still were in a tailspin. Many are tearing up pay systems and job structures, replacing them with new ones that slice wage rates, slash raises, and subcontract work to lower-paying suppliers.</p>
<p>"Although the problem [of slumping wages] has been plaguing Americans for years," wrote New York Times economics reporter Louis Uchitelle that same summer, "it is just now rising to the level of a major campaign issue." "Nearly everyone by now knows the situation," economic columnist William Greider wrote in November 1995, "either from the headlines or from their own daily lives: the continuing erosion of wage incomes for most American families."</p>
<p>Commenting on yet another twelve months of stagnant wage growth, Robert D. Hershey Jr wrote in late 1995: "The frustration and insecurity that have resulted are expected to play a major role in shaping next year's Presidential race as politicians of both parties try to portray themselves as the best choice to provide economic growth that will benefit the middle class."</p>
<p>On the other hand, many pundits, economists and business leaders seem not to lament the wage squeeze but rather to praise it. Instead of wringing their hands about working households' living standards, many express relief about the moderation of wage pressure on prices and profits--a trend they hope will dampen inflationary pressure, keep U.S. firms competitive in global markets, and protect small enterprises against business failure. When journalists report monthly data on workers' hourly earnings, they are much more likely to celebrate wage moderation or decline than to worry about its consequences for the millions who depend on that labor income. </p>

It Doesn't Have to Be This Way
<p>This book is for Maria Herrera and Bill Dameron.</p>
<p>Maria Herrera works as a janitor in office buildings in downtown Washington, D.C. She cleans up after lawyers and lobbyists who make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year writing loopholes into the laws. She earns $6.20 an hour. That's less for a whole week scrubbing floors than many of the people whose offices she cleans get for just an hour of attending meetings. She lives with her husband in a one-bedroom apartment and sends $200 each month to her mother and her son in her native Honduras. And she worries that "with what I'm making, I may not be able to help support my family."</p>
<p>Bill Dameron has worked for a fueling company at Dulles Airport in northern Virginia for twenty-one years. His job is putting the fuel in airplanes--and that takes a lot more skill than you and I need to fill up our cars at the self-service station. Bill knows the individual planes, their structure, and their fueling requirements. And he has specialized skills, such as balancing the fuel load properly among the various tanks on the wings and in the belly of the plane. Travelers bet their lives on the quality of his work. But even though he keeps taking on new responsibilities, he works longer hours and takes home less in real wages than he did fifteen years ago. "Workers like me have been on the losing end for too long," he says.</p>
<p>Paychecks and Power</p>
<p>Maria and Bill understand the problem that's at the heart of so much anger and anxiety in our country: America needs a raise.</p>
<p>When you factor in rising prices for food, housing, health care, and other necessities, most Americans are working for less than they earned in 1979. They are more productive than ever. But their productivity hasn't been rewarded with higher wages.</p>
<p>Instead, corporate America is converting productivity gains into higher profits, skyrocketing executive salaries, and a speculative boom on Wall Street. At the same time, profitable companies are wiping out tens of thousands of jobs--and finding ways to skim off money that's supposed to be set aside for their employees' pensions. The result is the most lopsided distribution of wealth since just before the Great Depression. </p>

1 Concepts, Measurement, and Data
<p>Although the concept of a job is easily understood, meaningful measurement and interpretation of job creation and destruction statistics require careful definitions and assumptions. In this chapter, we explain what we mean by a job and a plant. We explain how to use plant-level employment changes to calculate job creation and destruction, and we spell out the relationship between job reallocation and worker reallocation. We also briefly describe the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), which is the source of our statistical calculations. Detailed descriptions of our measurement procedures and the LRD appear in the technical appendix.</p>
<p>1.1 Job Creation and Destruction</p>
<p>In this study, a job is an employment position filled by a worker. Our data do not distinguish among part-time, full-time, and overtime employment positions- -all count equally as a single job. Except for the breakdown between production workers (e.g., assemblers and machine operatives) and non-production workers (e.g., managers and secretaries), our data do not distinguish among different occupations. We do not measure the number of vacancies (i.e., unfilled positions) at a point in time or the change in vacancies over time. Rather, we measure plant-level changes in the number of filled employment positions.</p>
<p>The basic observational unit underlying our job creation and destruction measures is the plant--a physical location where production takes place. As distinguished from a plant, a company or firm is an economic and legal entity that encompasses one or more plants and, possibly, administrative offices that specialize in management functions. Although we provide tabulations broken down by company and plant characteristics, all job creation and destruction measures reported in this study are cumulated from plant-level employment changes. Except for the breakdown between production and non-production workers, the plant represents the finest level of disaggregation available in the LRD for calculating job creation and destruction statistics.</p>
<p>We calculate job creation and destruction from plant-level net employment changes over twelve-month and three-month periods. If, for example, a plant expands by ten employees between March 1987 and March 1988, then, according to our calculations, the plant contributes ten jobs to the 1988 creation count. If another plant contracts by eight employees over the same time interval, it contributes eight jobs to the 1988 destruction count.</p>
<p>Because plants represent the observational units in the LRD, our calculations capture the effects of companies' shifting employment between plants. By the same token, our calculations do not capture the effects of job shifts within plants. For example, if a plant replaces several secretaries with an equal number of computer programmers, no net change in plant-level employment occurs; hence, our calculations record no job creation or destruction associated with this event. Because of the point-in-time nature of LRD employment data, our calculations also do not record plant-level employment changes that are reversed within the sampling interval. For example, if a plant lays off some workers in July 1987 and recalls an equal number in September 1987, there is no net effect on the plant's employment change between March 1987 and March 1988; hence, no contribution to job creation and destruction would be recorded as a result of this episode of layoff and recall. For both reasons--the failure to capture within-plant job shifts and the point-in-time nature of LRD employment data--our job creation and destruction measures understate the true magnitudes. </p>

<h2>F<font size=-1>AT</font> <font size=-1>AND</font> M<font size=-1>EAN</font>.<br></h2>

Since the early 1980s, economics experts have recommended "downsizing" as
the best way for U.S. corporations to remain competitive. Reducing
unnecessary staff would lower costs, increase profits, and transform these
companies into lean, mean production machines. As many American businesses
pursued this strategy--often in the wake of mergers and acquisitions that left
them with an unwieldy layer of middle management--and raised their bottom
line, it seemed the experts were right. Yet as David M. Gordon shows in this
iconoclastic book, most of them have really only gone halfway. They are
"mean," but far from lean.
<p>Tracing the overall employment patterns of the past decade, Gordon shows that most American companies actually employ more managers and supervisors than ever before. These ever-increasing functionaries control company payrolls and pay themselves generous salaries--at the expense of average workers. For despite a steadily growing economy, the real wages of the American worker have been falling for the past 20 years. To explain this decline and the much- debated "wage gap" that resulted, pundits and professors invoke various causes ranging from the flow of production jobs overseas to the average worker's lack of the technological skills needed in today's "knowledge economy." But Gordon exposes the single greatest factor in this decline, a corporate strategy that penalizes line workers and hinders businesses from competing effectively in world markets: the simultaneous overstaffing of management hierarchies and the inadequate compensation of workers.</p>
<p>Instead of sharing profits with their employees, thus encouraging them to work harder, management has more often opted to prod workers by instilling fear of layoffs. Gordon unerringly plots the shortsighted and disastrous course of U.S corporations, and documents the tremendous social and personal costs to their employees. Yet in addition to telling the harsh truth about downsizing, he suggest policies to increase fairer business practices. Wages can increase- indeed, they must-as the economy begins to perform more efficiently.</p>
<p>U.S. corporations have become fat and mean They need to become lean and decent--not just for the sake of their workers, but for the sake of their competitive advantage. This provocative and original book shows how they can. </p>

"If your paycheck doesn't go as far as it used to, or if you're
<ul> concerned that our society is coming apart at the seams, this book is for you. John Sweeney offers a compelling vision of how working Americans can restore not only their living standards but also the traditional American values of work, family, and community." --Marian Wright Edelman </ul>
<p>John J. Sweeney and the new leadership of the AFL-CIO are committing millions of dollars and thousands of organizers to the mobilization of working people all over the country. America Needs a Raise is Sweeney's manifesto. It is a blunt yet compassionate account of the dilemmas facing American workers of all kinds: high tech and low, immigrant and native born, blue collar and white. Sweeney targets the growing disparity between rich and poor, the decline in the standard of living of middle- and working-class Americans, the overwork and unemployment, the racial polarization and ethnic animosity, and the gnawing sense of powerlessness and uncertainty that afflicts us all. He indicts corporate America for its "lean and mean" abdication of social responsibility. He offers a way of dealing with the realities of the global economy that is more effective and humane than the downsizing of America and the sacrifice of working people on the altar of international competitiveness. Most of all, Sweeney offers a breath of hope for all those deeply worried about economic insecurity, social injustice, and the decline of our communities. </p>

<p><b>Biography</p></b>
John J. Sweeney was elected president of the AFL-CIO in October 1995.
Previously he led the Service Employees International Union, which, during a
period when the rest of the labor movement was in steep decline, grew from
625,000 to 1.1 million members. Known for his militant championing of the
poorest and least powerful segments of the work force, Sweeney has also
served on the National Committee on Employment Policy and in the
International Labor Organization. He is the coauthor of Solutions for a New
Work Force. He lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife, a former New York
City schoolteacher, and their two children.

<h2>J<font size=-1>OB</font> C<font size=-1>REATION</font> <font size=-1>AND</font> D<font size=-1>ESTRUCTION</font>.<br></h2>
<p> By Steven Davis, John Haltiwanger and Scott Schuh.  <br>
<i>Press; 282 pages; $27.50 and &#163;23.50</i><br>

<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
Steven Davis, John Haltiwanger, and Scott Schuh study the ebb and flow of
jobs in the U.S. manufacturing sector during the last two decades. Their
surprising findings about where jobs are created and the frequency of job
destruction have already stimulated a body of journal articles and research by
many other economists interested in the operation of labor markets, business
cycle fluctuations, and the evolution of industries. The authors now present this
research in a single, up-to-date, complete source with an explanation of their
methods and a discussion of the usefulness of these concepts and measures for
economic policy.
<p>Using the most complete plant-level data source currently available--the Longitudinal Research Database constructed by the Census Bureau--Job Creation and Destruction focuses on the U.S. manufacturing sector from 1972 to 1988 and develops a statistical portrait of the microeconomic adjustment to the many economic events that affect businesses and workers. The picture that emerges is one of large, persistent, and highly concentrated gross job creation and destruction, with job destruction dominating the cyclical features of aggregate employment.</p>
<p>By focusing on the employer rather than the worker side of the process, the authors fill a large gap in the literature on labor market dynamics. They describe in detail the relationship between job creation and destruction and employer characteristics, including the relationship of job creation to employer size, industry, wage level, international trade, capital and energy intensity in production, age of plant, and productivity performance. The resulting statistical portrait provides many insights into the job creation and destruction process that are directly relevant to economists and policymakers.</p>
<p>A technical appendix details the measurement procedures and instructions for obtaining the data. </p>

<p><b>Literary cannonades</b></p>
<h2>A year in Arcadia</h2><ul> <li>G<font size=-1>REAT</font> B<font size=-1>OOKS</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By David Denby.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Simon &amp; Schuster; 492 pages; $30</i> <br>
</ul>


<p>A WINNER of the Nobel prize for chemistry was once asked what courses he had found most valuable at Columbia, New York's elite Ivy League college. "The core", came his answer. It startled the interviewer but would not have surprised many Columbia graduates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever else they are studying, students there have to take two courses: on the literary masterpieces of Europe and on the great works of philosophy and political theory. Each course, held in small classes, takes four hours a week for a year. The reading lists have changed a bit with time and taste but there are plenty of old immoveables such as the "Iliad", the "Inferno" and "King Lear".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The idea behind "the core" was that whatever students go on to do they ought at least to have met the writers who formed the heart of western culture and who spoke most directly to what humans were and could be. For decades that aim seemed so obviously sensible and high-minded as to be beyond question. But times change and "the core" became controversial, political even, as anyone who read even a paragraph or two about the ideological battles on America's campuses in the 1980s will know.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rather than re-fight those familiar "culture wars" head-on, David Denby, who reviews films for <i>New York Magazine</i>, had a genial idea. In middle age many people fantasise about re-enrolling in the university courses they liked most or wished they had done more with. At 48, Mr Denby fulfilled this dream and retook the Columbia "great-books" courses he had done in 1961. Out of his experience has come a captivating book that casts light on many things: on the job of a critic, on what classics are, on the pleasure of sustained reading (as against magazine flipping, hypertext clicking or literary theorising) and on how the best teaching in the humanities can still stretch young minds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How good teachers work with gifted young people has always been something of a mystery: a charged, intimate experience, often written about from either side but seldom recorded by mature, neutral observers. In fascinating detail Mr Denby describes how professors lead their charges in argument without patronising them, let alone trying to indoctrinate. Behind a cloak of pseudonyms the students emerge as distinct and lively personalities. In one striking vignette, a teacher well known for espousing lesbian feminism patiently expounds to a mixed class of men and women, blacks and whites, Aristotle's views on the natural inferiority of women and the need of orderly societies for inequality.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A <i>Leitmotiv</i> of Mr Denby's is the part classics by Dead White Males play in an American university where Asians, Hispanics and African-Americans account for over a third of the students and where <font size=-1>WASP</font> men are a minority. Mr Denby mounts a thoughtful, compelling case against putting together literary canons on the basis of skin-colour and gender. Columbia's two "great-books" courses took hold, he notes, as the university transformed itself from being an almost entirely upper-class Protestant enclave to being a much more open place taking the intellectually gifted children of Jewish, Italian and East European immigrants. The aim then was to assimilate those excluded from the larger culture of the nation. In the 1980s "assimilating" courses came under attack for, it was said, marginalising minorities, such as blacks or women, and later immigrants.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not so long ago Columbia admitted women and, coincidentally or not, some women writers, notably Virginia Woolf, entered the "great-books" course. As a student of the English novel years ago, Mr Denby could not stand her, but now she strikes him as indisputably great and he is accordingly grateful that the canon was forced open. Yet Mr Denby avoids simple-minded conclusions. As an example of honest literary standards, he cites Woolf's "A Room of One's Own". In it she judged many women writers severely, refusing to overlook literary failings just because as members of a "second sex" they led demeaning lives: on the contrary, she thought, a sense of wounded subordination often tends to produce bad writing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the end of the year Mr Denby was not surprised by his love of the western classics but was struck to be reminded what they really are: "less a conquering army", in his vivid phrase, "than a kingdom of untamable beasts, at war with one another and with readers". To explore this wilderness, even with a guide, he believes, is to get a bracing course in tough-mindedness, moral doubt and self-criticism. Far from being a frozen and "hegemonic" celebration of the West, the "great books", Mr Denby found, raise one big question after another. If, as well you might, you envy Mr Denby his year-long reading party, you should read his exuberant book.

</ul><ul></ul>

SHADOWS thrown by floodlights on walls and sentryposts, those gritty traces of old frontiers where ideologies bristled at each other, lurk in the minds of too many writers of political thrillers and spy fiction. Those were good days, you can hear authors yearn in books turned out since the Berlin Wall fell. Before then readers more or less knew who the bad guys were, and writers aping a few well-known models such as John le Carr&eacute; could endlessly permutate bad apples, weak politicians, double-dealing deskmen and unwilling heroes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fresh veins being tricky to find, Frederick Forsyth tries hard to get a line from old ones. "Icon", set in Russia, exploits his nose for big events and his eye for circumstantial detail. In the run-up to a post-Yeltsin presidential election, a clever, charismatic right-winger is accidentally discovered by British intelligence to have a hidden Hitlerian agenda and to be in cahoots with the Russian mafia. Stopping him becomes a matter of principle for the intelligence men, but (echoes of Munich) they get no help from wimpish western leaders.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new-world disorder east of the river Bug ought to crackle with possibilities for good spy fiction, though you would not think so to read Mr Forsyth. He pulls the dreariest old-world spooks out of retirement to take the wheels off the villain's bandwagon. Their <font size=-1>MO</font> is stale and, despite its potential, the whole saga is as dull as watching morons let tyres down.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tom Clancy is at least aware that today's spies need new challenges. In "Executive Orders", he gives his longest-running character, the spy Jack Ryan, two big ones: how, having been flung by a cataclysmic accident into the Oval Office, to run the government of the United States when most of Congress and the Supreme Court are dead; and how to prevent a newly conjoined Iran-Iraq republic from savaging its neighbours and the interests of America in the Middle East.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This enormously long book keeps up a reasonable pace despite its many gratuitous diversions, such as the introduction of two characters whose main purpose seems to be to represent the hate-affair some Americans have with all things federal. The story covers a wide front, including a nasty biological attack on America's cities, which makes new work for the intelligence services (who did it?) and leads to decisive military retaliation overseas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clancy, as ever, entertains with this book, but also leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. He (or his hero) seems to feel that America would be better off if its sleazy, ineffectual politicians were all wiped away and replaced by selfless, ever-competent professionals (spies for foreign affairs, bankers for economic policy) who need not worry about public opinion or special-interest groups. Mr Clancy's books are hugely popular in America: are his (or Jack Ryan's) Platonic opinions popular, too?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the more complex, more tainted world of John le Carr&eacute;, Mr Clancy's simplicities would soon vanish in a swamp as corrupt as the one he wants to drain. Shrewd old pro that he is, Mr le Carr&eacute; has ruthlessly let go his entire cold-war staff and brought in new personnel, each as nicely rendered in "The Tailor of Panama" as in earlier books. Their sweaty awfulness oozes off the page yet they all have their own distinctively dreadful chemistry. These characters alone are a cruel reproof to Mr Forsyth's and Mr Clancy's robots.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a story, "The Tailor of Panama" is less a thriller than a comic opera. The unfortunate tailor of the title, a British expatriate, is recruited by incompetent spies desperate to find a conspiracy, any conspiracy, which can be embroidered up to convince superiors in London that they should keep signing the expense accounts. If the premise sounds weak, Mr le Carr&eacute; develops the tale with almost farcical verve. He revels in the contortions of British diplomats, aghast at the <i>arriviste </i>spymasters whom they pretend to accept, all the while struggling to extricate themselves from absurd but inevitable catastrophe. Readers who wonder whether Graham Greene was not here 40 years ago are right, and Mr le Carr&eacute; acknowledges his debt to "Our Man in Havana". This tale, told with wit and ingenuity, is a splendid homage from one master of political thrillers to another.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ennui of a spy world shorn of enemies is exploited with a lot less warmth and humour by J. K. Mayo. No longer locked together in silent war, the "masterless men" of his title need a new common bond and have found one in money-making crime. Their old masters must destroy them, and bloodily. The plot has too many coincidences. But at its best Mr Mayo's prose has a rough sparseness that echoes John Buchan, and his musings about complicity and betrayal are just pointed (and short) enough to be readable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Mayo's night thoughts, however, will sound almost dainty when set against the raw disgust with which John Fullerton writes in "The Monkey House". His setting is Sarajevo under siege and although readers will have seen or read countless reports about the bombing and bullying of the city, few have much clue what it was really like to live in that pit of despair.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Fullerton, a journalist who worked in Bosnia, spares little in this bleak tale of a cop who has to solve a drug addict's murder. He must pick though torn families, shredded loyalties and unfathomable enmities in a town where old obligations seem suddenly without meaning and where the moral vacuum feels far more perilous than the daily rain of mortar-bombs and snipers' bullets. Well-written and tightly plotted, "The Monkey House" is a chilling, angry thriller in which one policeman's search is a small light snuffed out by countless lost souls. If the best political thrillers each have their own vision of hell, Mr Fullerton has certainly found his.

<p><b>Travels in America</b></p>
<h2>Gulled pioneers</h2><ul> <li>B<font size=-1>AD</font> L<font size=-1>AND</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Jonathan Raban.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Picador; 320 pages; &#163;15.99. Pantheon; $25</i> <br>
</ul>


<p>THIS was the year the American press discovered Montana. First came the 81-day siege by the <font size=-1>FBI</font> of a ranch in Jordan, taken over by the Montana Freemen; then the capture in April of Ted Kaczynski, the man alleged to be the Unabomber, in a cabin in the woods near Lincoln. Suddenly, easterners discovered an authentic badland, glinting with bigotry and violence in almost unimaginable space.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jonathan Raban, an English-born writer transplanted to Seattle, discovered it a little earlier. His is an engrossing and sympathetic attempt to reconstruct the lives of the homesteaders who, between 1910 and the 1930s (when most gave up), tried to make a living by farming in eastern Montana. They were lured west by government offers of land and by pamphlets, published by the railway companies, which promised enormous harvests from the virgin soil: furrows shining with coins.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, the land was desert. Uncharacteristically wet weather lulled the settlers for a few years; then, in 1917, drought came, along with searing winters and plagues of grasshoppers. The homesteaders hung on as long as they could, determined to try to make a go of it. Then, chastened, they headed further west, where they ended up logging in the north-western forests or apple-picking (so like the lowly piece-work they had left in Europe!) in the orchards of Washington state.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Little remains of their struggles. The 1916 map of the Chicago, Milwaukee and Puget Sound railway line, published as the end-papers to this book, shows a thick procession of towns along the route, confidently named after the daughters and acquaintances of the railway directors. Most of these are now virtual ghost-towns, with collapsed shacks still bearing the names of "Bank" or "General Store", while their few remaining residents live in trailers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The homesteads themselves, always difficult to distinguish in the featureless prairie, sometimes still hold the ruin of a farmhouse; more often, all that remains is the carcass of an old car, a path to a hen-house, or a patent lightning-conductor sticking out of the ground. Travelling salesmen did a brisk trade in these; indeed, the empty plains swarmed with salesmen and loan sharks bent on separating the naive homesteaders from their money.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a tale of almost unbearable folly, disingenuousness and sadness, lifted only by the sheer courage of the immigrants. Its saddest moments come when Mr Raban intrudes on the ruins of the homesteads, finding in one a set of desperate household accounts, in another the remains of a photograph album burned before departure. The ruin of a one-room schoolhouse produces reading books with advice on saving money and mending clothes. He even finds a copy of Campbell's "Soil Culture Manual", the dry-farmer's bible, promising yields of 54 bushels of wheat to the acre. It has been broken at the spine, and bears the print of a muddy boot.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The patient observation in this book is captivating. Less convincing is Mr Raban's argument that the homesteaders, tricked by the federal government, grew naturally into militiamen and survivalists. It was not only the government that lured them west; they wanted to go west themselves. Once they were there, the government enticed them with cheap loans; but it was the homesteaders who fell for the shiny mowers and harvesters on offer from the agricultural companies, stumbling into debts they could not possibly repay.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As far as western anti-government feeling goes, Mr Raban is not much nearer to explaining it at the end of his book than he was at the beginning. And that is only to be expected. His yuppie liberal sympathies continually give him away. He drives a Jeep, rather than a pick-up; he wears a Brooks Brothers tweed jacket, not a plaid shirt; he votes Democratic. At one especially revealing point, when he has crossed the continental divide and reached the Cascade range, he comes across the Skykomish river, "a torrent of boiling cappuccino". Only a rank outsider could describe the badlands of America as perceptively as Mr Raban does; but he is also doomed, this reader feels, never wholly to understand them.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Introduction to the Case
<p>Some years ago, Donald (Dax) Cowart, an unmarried 25 year old man, returned from active duty in the Air Force and, while waiting for a job in the airlines industry, worked in real estate development. One summer's day, Dax drove out to look at some unpopulated land that he was considering as an investment. As he was getting ready to leave, his attempt to start his car set off an explosion in a buried but leaking gas pipeline. Dax received second- and third-degree burns over two-thirds of his body.</p>
<p>Dax's injuries left him severely scarred. His hands were badly deformed and the sight in his one remaining eye was at risk. As a patient, he had to undergo daily treatment in an antiseptic tank. This was so painful to him that he asked the doctors to stop his treatment. Dax felt that the length of his projected treatment, and the expected quality of life that he would receive from it, did not warrant the torment that he was experiencing. The doctors knew that if they continued his treatment, he would live; if they stopped his treatment, he would surely die. The question is now raised: Does Dax have a right to die? If so, what exactly does that mean?</p>
<p>This CD-ROM provides you with an interactive multimedia environment in which to explore the case of Dax Cowart. This User Guide gives you set-up instructions and a general overview of the program.</p>
<p>A Teacher's Guide is also available with the multi-user package. This contains further background information and numerous suggestions on how to use the program in various settings.</p>
<p>Final note: This CD-ROM is in a sense a "tool"; an important pedagogical environment that allows a user to "experience" a real-world case in all its emotional detail and moral complexity. It should be used thoughtfully and in the context of specific disciplinary needs. It is intended to be an element in the ongoing discussion about patients' rights and doctors' responsibilities, both from the perspective of individual situations and policy needs. </p>

<p><b>Biology and society</b></p>
<h2>The geneology of morals</h2><ul> <li>T<font size=-1>HE</font> O<font size=-1>RIGINS OF</font> V<font size=-1>IRTUE</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Matt Ridley. &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i> Viking; 295 pages; &#163;20</i> <br>
</ul>

<p>MATT RIDLEY is easily one of the best science writers around. A zoologist by training, he writes with a fresh zeal and has large things to say or report about the biological basis for human motivation and behaviour. He has the range and equipment to be what, in the 17th and 18th centuries, was known as a "natural philosopher", a much-needed species of thinker-scientist that sub-specialisation has all but wiped out. "The Red Queen", an earlier book of his, on the evolution of sex, deserved its good reviews. Against these high standards, "The Origins of Virtue" comes as a disappointment: over-ambitious in scope, frustratingly muddled in argument and showing tell-tale signs of haste.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a hard book to summarise. The ground covered is vast. Taken as a tempting sampler of recent work in evolutionary psychology, it succeeds well enough. Mr Ridley briefly recounts the big shift within biology 20-30 years ago which replaced the species with the individual gene as the basic unit of evolutionary change. Insights that game theory offers into the "blind" but apparently strategic working of natural selection are then fascinatingly reported, as are countless other suggestive analogies of biology or behaviour between human and non-human animals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far, so good. It is the red thread that Mr Ridley tries to find in all this that gets him, or his uninitiated readers, in a tangle. The argument, roughly, is this. History shows that no society survives without reciprocity and co-operation; evolutionary biology (on a leading current interpretation) shows that humans are but vehicles for "selfish" genes. How then did social values evolve? The gap between nature and society looks too big. Or rather once it did. Now, as Mr Ridley reports with justified excitement, evolutionary biologists think they know at least where to start making bridges: they are beginning to show how, both among humans and lower animals, certain sorts of seemingly unselfish deed might be useful in passing on the doer's genes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That achievement deserves only applause (or will do when powerful early insights can be purged of misleading metaphors and amplified with a lot more detail). But it is important to see these promised advances in biology for what they are--answers to gaps or puzzles in the tale of evolution--and not to push them farther than they will go.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How they will bear on the riotous variety of language and kinship, law and morals, politics and culture found in human societies is hard at this remove to say. Biology will be part of the story, more maybe than dogmatic opponents of "sociobiology" allow. But "biological" is not a synonym for "natural" or "systematic". People's behaviour has many levels. Biology is never likely to tell the whole story of the human animal's conduct.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At times Mr Ridley writes as if he thinks gene-bequeathal did motivate all human behaviour, much as Marxists once thought they had revealed class-interest, Freudians unconscious drives, and religious believers divine election as the hidden motor of people's actions. Explaining others' motives to them is a pleasure, and Mr Ridley records with relish how some human enterprises--the Wars of the Roses, for example, or football riots--mimic animal behaviour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But he is also keen to show how a gene-based view of human history leaves a conservative-minded westerner's most cherished social values undisturbed. Ingenious examples and experiments are brought in to show how natural selection may have favoured "virtue" (hence the book's title), by which he really means social, as opposed to anti-social, behaviour. This is a welcome corrective to biologically minded thinkers for whom humans threatened to become prisoners of an inherently selfish genetic nature. But to others not tempted by that illusion, it looks more like a theory reversing gracefully out of a cul-de-sac. The book ends with a chapter called "Trust". A better name would be "The biological basis of recent Anglo-American conservatism"; it would have been wiser to leave it out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two enemies haunt this book: the cruder foes of sociobiology, and moral philosophers. Mr Ridley's impatience with the first is understandable. His mistrust of the second is a pity. Philosophers do in some sense parasitise science, but in ways science can learn from. To put it at its simplest, learning the origin of a moral rule does not tell you if it is a good one or not. Imagine that gene-bequeathal is shown to be humanity's golden rule. People have evolved to a point where they still have to ask, "Yes, but should it be?"

<p><b>Byte-stained wretches</b></p>
<h2>Newspapers on the Internet still look like interlopers</h2><ul></ul>


<p>IN the early 1800s Mary Shelley had only to see a frog's leg twitch under an electric current to dream up Frankenstein. Today Internet surfers see some news flit across their computer screen and they conjure up Frankenpaper, the destroyer of the traditional newspaper.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As they say, newsprint wastes trees, it leaves ink on your hands, it takes a fleet of lorries and an army of children to distribute, and is still often out of date by the time it reaches its readers. Internet newspapers are immediate, global, can be searched in seconds, and customised to a reader's every interest--just Wall Street, Leeds United and jazz, thanks very much.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The digital zealots write off newsprint too soon. Paper is portable, lasting, easy on the eye, and quick and comfortable to read. The chances are, rather, that traditional newspapers will keep producing new and improved digital editions on the basis of their paper versions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of the world's top newspapers are already moving on-line to try their hand at this new game, if not to take advantage of its efficiencies, then simply to keep up with the competition. The result so far: the same static and dated stories, but etched in electrons and phosphor rather than dead trees and ink.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most newspapers today are simply treating the Internet as another sort of printing press--another place to dump last night's snapshot of the news. But these are still early days. As the Internet market evolves and grows, newspapers will undoubtedly grow with it (as will <i>The Economist</i>'s own experimental site). This is how they are doing so far:</p>
<p><b><i>New York Times</i> (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">http://www.nytimes.com</a>)</b><br>The Grey Lady has never been trendy, but when she moves, she usually moves surely. Her Web site is solid, useful and comprehensive. Not much flair, except in the computer section and moderated forums, but the <i>Times</i>'s stories have never needed much embellishment.
<br><font size=-1>CONTENT:</font> Entire issue.
<br><font size=-1>COST:</font> Free in America; $35 a month elsewhere (half that initially).
<br><font size=-1>LOOK:</font> A touch of Grey Lady to set the tone at the top, then straight text.<br><font size=-1>SEARCH:</font> Soon available: all articles in past week, and selected articles back to 1980. Headlines and synopsis free, $1.95 per article for full text.
<br><font size=-1>FUN FEATURE:</font> Thriving forums, chaired by celebrities (such as James Gleick, the author of "Chaos", who handles debates on the future of newspapers, on-line economics and intellectual property); an enjoyable--so far--flood of generally intelligent comment from readers.</p>
<p><b><i>London Times and Sunday Times</i> (<a href="http://www.the-times.co.uk/">http://www.the-times.co.uk</a>)</b>
<br>Despite recent efforts to brighten itself up, today's <i>Times</i> remains rather dull. It seems livelier on the Web. The stories are no better than the print versions, but the on-line design is one of the world's best.
<br><font size=-1>CONTENT:</font> Entire issue.
<br><font size=-1>COST:</font> Free.
<br><font size=-1>LOOK:</font> Colour-coded tabs for each section make navigation easy.
<br><font size=-1>SEARCH:</font> Only current issue.
<br><font size=-1>FUN FEATURE:</font> Working crossword.

<p><b><i>Financial Times</i> (<a href="http://www.ft.com/">http://www.ft.com</a>)</b>
<br>A tentative site from a paper that could do a lot with customised displays and hypertext, but has not yet worked out quite how.
<br><font size=-1>CONTENT:</font> Just top stories, a few market indicators and a news summary.
<br><font size=-1>COST:</font> Free.
<br><font size=-1>LOOK:</font> Pink and boring.
<br><font size=-1>SEARCH:</font> None.
<br><font size=-1>FUN FEATURE:</font> Daily share prices for listed British companies.</p>
<p><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b>
<b>(<a href="http://www.wsj.com/">http://www.wsj.com</a>)</b>
<br>This impressive site is devoted mainly to the <i>Journal'</i>s "Money and Investing" section, but has many other articles too. It is a preview of the full-paper service with continual updates that will be introduced later this year.
<br><font size=-1>CONTENT:</font> Main business and financial stories.
<br><font size=-1>COST:</font> Free at the moment.
<br><font size=-1>LOOK:</font> A clean and quick read.
<br><font size=-1>SEARCH:</font> Past month, free.
<br><font size=-1>FUN FEATURE:</font> Company profiles.</p>
<p><b><i>San Jose Mercury News</i></b>
<b>(<a href="http://www.sjmercury.com/">http://www.sjmercury.com</a>)</b>
<br>The newspaper of Silicon Valley should have one of the best Web versions, and indeed the <i>Mercury News</i> does: it is fully interactive, allowing readers to set up quickly a custom paper with just the news they want.
<br><font size=-1>CONTENT:</font> Entire issue.
<br><font size=-1>COST:</font> Some content free; $4.95 a month for full access ($1 a month for current subscribers).
<br><font size=-1>LOOK:</font> A long, scrollable strip of departments in frames--the first newspaper that looks as if it was designed from scratch for a computer screen.
<br><font size=-1>SEARCH:</font> All stories since November 1994.
<br><font size=-1>FUN FEATURE:</font> Resum&eacute; service linked to classified ads.</p>
<p><b><i>USA Today</i></b>
<b>(<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/">http://www.usatoday.com</a>)</b>
<br>The paper that anticipated the fractured and icon-heavy style of the Internet was a natural for Web publishing. Thanks to a fast server, it retains its graphic look without much of a speed penalty.
<br><font size=-1>CONTENT:</font> Entire issue.
<br><font size=-1>COST:</font> Free.
<br><font size=-1>LOOK:</font> Bouncy mix of graphics, icons and text.
<br><font size=-1>SEARCH:</font> Full text for past six days.
<br><font size=-1>FUN FEATURE:</font> Current sports scores.</p>
<p><b><i>Le Monde</i></b>
<b>(<a href="http://www.lemonde.fr">http://www.lemonde.fr</a>)</b>
<br>France is home of the path-breaking, if now dated, Minitel computer network and a foe of English-language cultural imperialism. No surprise, then, that the Internet has been slow to take off there. <i>Le Monde</i> is among the very best newspapers in the world, but its current Net offering is second-rate.
<br><font size=-1>CONTENT:</font> The front page, top stories and a few special features.
<br><font size=-1>COST:</font> Free.
<br><font size=-1>LOOK:</font> An unnecessarily faithful reproduction of the paper <i>Le Monde</i>; it takes minutes to download.
<br><font size=-1>SEARCH</font>: Not yet.
<br><font size=-1>FUN FEATURE</font>: Send e-mail congratulation to the day's newlyweds.</p>
<p><b><i>Die Welt (<a href="http://www.welt.de/">http://www.welt.de</a>)</i></b>
<br>German dailies are not for the faint-hearted: a dozen pages of news, whole sections on culture and engineering, a day's reading on finance and economics. Such weight seems even more daunting on <i>Die Welt</i>'s dry and dated site.
<br><font size=-1>CONTENT:</font> Headlines and a generous sampling of full stories.
<br><font size=-1>COST:</font> Free.
<br><font size=-1>LOOK:</font> Boring, texty.
<br><font size=-1>SEARCH:</font> Daily stories back to May 1985.
<br><font size=-1>FUN FEATURE:</font> Stockmarket index.

</ul>
<p>QUITE apart from its considerable merits as a tool for a Russian speaker learning English, "English for Communication" is an enthralling work of fiction to the ear of a native English speaker. Its dialogues and routines carry within them a faint echo of dissonance, grammatical or semantic, that raises them from the banal to the inspired. For example:
<ul><font size=-1>She doesn't look her age, does she?</font></ul>
How old is she?
I never ask women about their age.
Or, even better in its way:
<ul><font size=-1>Thank you for the compliment.</font></ul>
It's not a compliment. I meant it.
These and other exchanges form part of a running script between a dozen main characters that breaks down into ten "lessons", each emphasising a group of grammatical points and stock phrases. The plot verges on the surreal: a group of English and American scientists gathers for a conference in Moscow on an unspecified topic that is to be filmed by a famous director and covered by the correspondents of several national newspapers. But at least it is a plot of sorts, and thus enough to give a general coherence and sense of direction to the material--which, set against some rival offerings, is no trivial achievement.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The interface of "English for Communication" is a model of its kind, evidently designed by somebody who knows about the needs of computer users as well as those of language students. It uses menu- and hot-button commands of the type that will be second nature to the user of a word-processing program.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Times-Roman lettering is clear, big and bright. Photographs and short video-clips are embedded into texts. The program window can be scaled up and down. There are buttons for going back and forward, printing, saving and recording, turning off the sound, and for switching vertically and horizontally between sections of the course (ie, from the dialogues of lesson one to the grammar or the routines of lesson one; or from the dialogues of lesson one to the dialogues of lesson two).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mouse-sensitive text is displayed on the screen in English or in English and Russian parallel texts. Click, and it is spoken aloud. Another click is enough to secure a repeat. These may sound obvious points, but they display a measure of common sense that is still all too rarely encountered when booting up a strange <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A further virtue of "English for Communication" is that the facts and lore about English life are true and useful. Don't confuse the English with the Scots, for example. When you hear the English criticising their country, don't join in. When in doubt, talk about cricket or the weather.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Global German" and "Global French" deserve high marks for their ease of loading. They come with neat instruction booklets that tell you precisely what and where to type in order to start the loading process. And as the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> loads, it runs a neat utility program that tests whether <font size=-1>WAV</font> and <font size=-1>MIDI</font> sound systems are working as they should be. But after that it is pretty much downhill. Tinkly music drives out concentration and makes the student wish that his <font size=-1>MIDI</font> player were not working after all. The interface hogs the whole screen, making it impossible to shrink the window and get on with something else, or to fiddle with the computer's settings, without leaving the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> all together.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The student may learn words, phrases or (now and again) sentences, but from lists and tables as though this were at best an intelligent dictionary. Vocabulary is presented in grids of words that change from one language to another when clicked. Grammar is delivered in great slabs of small-font text. At best the student may get to rearrange a sentence, or attempt a test which consists of trying to find the right word buried in a table of wrong ones. There is no sense of direction, and hence no incentive to progress. A much more attractive approach is taken by "Japanese for Business", which is something of a cross between a phrase book and a computer game. It is hard to imagine anyone learning much useful Japanese here, apart from a few phrases. But the cultural tips, business protocol, travel hints, menus, music, games, quizzes, random snippets of information and animated cartoons offer a delightful way of preparing yourself for a first visit to Japan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clearly, there are big differences of style and approach between different publishers of <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> language courses. But collectively they are enough to provoke doubts as to whether <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> will ever offer a language-learning medium as effective as book, tape or flesh-and-blood teacher.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For one thing, the main virtue of a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> is its capacity for random access--which makes it the perfect medium for works of reference. But the main quality of any good language course will tend to be its robustness of structure, carrying the student where the student will often not want to go. Learning a language through course-work is rarely "fun", of the kind to which home-computer <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s tend to aspire. More often it is something much closer to a painful struggle against the deficiencies of your intellect.

<p><b>Post-communist Russia</b></p>
<h2>Bears routed</h2><ul> <li><a href="11ex334.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> C<font size=-1>OMING</font> R<font size=-1>USSIAN</font> B<font size=-1>OOM</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Richard Layard and John Parker. <br>
</ul>


<p>AFTER the fall of Soviet communism in 1991, the pessimists lost little time predicting that post-communist Russia would come to a sticky end. A collapsed economy, hurt pride and rampant nationalism, they said, would soon drive it to neo-communist or neo-fascist imperialism. It has not happened yet, and the great merit of this excellent book is to show why it is unlikely to happen.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It carefully charts post-communist Russia's admittedly unsteady and uneven progress toward creating a market economy, democracy and the rule of law. The authors' first-hand knowledge and insider perspective--Richard Layard has been an economic adviser to successive post-communist reformers, John Parker was Moscow correspondent, and is now special features editor, of <i>The Economist</i>--give their attractively written account the stamp of authority. The decisive repudiation of the communists in the presidential election in July strengthens their upbeat analysis.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sceptics will say that the prediction that Russia will grow by 4% a year "for a decade or more" is far too bullish. But the authors make a powerful case for it. Russia has a highly educated workforce, exceptional natural resources, a potentially huge domestic market. Add to this the fact that the Russian economy has been largely privatised, that much of the financial and legal framework for commercial enterprise is now in place and that Russia, unlike China, has a post-communist constitution, and it is not hard to foresee an investment boom, given moderately competent political management.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Layard and Mr Parker demolish familiar misconceptions. One is that the economy should have been "de-monopolised" before prices were liberated. They point out that President Boris Yeltsin and Yegor Gaidar (his first economics minister) never had this choice. They inherited from Mr Gorbachev a state and an economy which barely functioned. Freeing prices (done at a stroke on January 2nd 1992) was the only way to get food back into the shops, end the queues and start restructuring industry for market demand.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Equally silly is the frequent claim that "tight money" caused the collapse of output. Far from money being tight over the crucial period in 1992-93 when output fell, most of Russia was on the verge of hyperinflation. Output collapsed mainly because the planned economy collapsed. Loose, not tight, money contributed to the output fall by depressing real incomes--a point which deserves more emphasis than it receives here. Unexpectedly, high continuing inflation enabled a "classical" type of industrial restructuring to take place: as the authors put it, workers in declining firms were "pulled" into better jobs by the fall in their relative wages rather than being "pushed" out of old jobs into unemployment as happens in Western Europe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Layard and Mr Parker do not disguise the traumas which the Russians have suffered since the reforms started. Most Russians are still worse off than they were in 1991, especially pensioners, and children from poor families. Doing business in Russia remains tough. It is not the "mafia" which makes it so, but lack of secure legal definition and enforcement of property rights. Agriculture has barely been de-collectivised.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is good to see President Yeltsin acknowledged as the real hero of post-communist Russia. "It is a remarkable testimony to [his] genius that...he should have selected in turn as economic overlords four outstanding men: Gaidar, Fedorov, Shokhin and Chubais." An encomium to the long-suffering Russian people would not have been out of place. Whenever it has really mattered, they have supported their president and the reform policy. They deserve better of their rulers than they have had in the past. For the first time, they may be about to get lucky.<br>

Introduction
<p>What has been achieved? - Why the pessimists were wrong - The future</p>
<p>A great nation loses a war and much of its empire. It then plunges into economic turmoil. This is the formula that produced Hitler. Will Russia go the same way? Or will it be a friendly neighbor, with a prosperous new capitalist economy?</p>
<p>Six times in the past three hundred years Russia has turned outward to the West, seeking to modernize its economy and liberalize its society. The first five of those attempts all ended in failure. Will this one succeed?</p>
<p>The answer is crucial for us all. For the reform covers every aspect of life: - In economics Russia has been trying to build a market economy based on private enterprise. If the attempt continues, Russia will soon offer great opportunities for foreign investment and trade plus a better life for its people. But will the reform continue?</p>
<p>- In politics Russia for the first time in its life has a democratically elected government. But can democracy survive the clashes of interest generated by the process of economic change?</p>
<p>- In international relations Russia no longer aims to defeat the West and is making serious efforts to became a partner instead. But will Russian nationalism rise up again, like German nationalism between the wars, driving the world back to the old balance of terror?</p>
<p>These questions are critical to Western businessmen interested in business opportunities in Russia. They are also vital for western citizens hoping for a more peaceful world. And they are even more important to every Russian who wants prosperity, freedom, and peace. We shall do our best to answer them.</p>
<p>To many people in both Russia and the West the omens seem bad. They point first to Russia's difficult background. Russia was much more deeply penetrated by communism than any other country in the world. Communists gained power in 1917 rather than after 1945, so nobody in Russia remembers what capitalism was like before they took over. On the political front, Russia has never been a democracy before--tsar and general secretary were both autocrats. And, internationally, Russia always held itself somewhat aloof, an instinct reinforced by three murderous invasions from the West in 1812, 1914, and 1941. After each previous reform failed, Russia turned in upon itself, shunning the social and economic forms of the West.</p>
<p>The pessimists find further support for their case in the current situation. They highlight the return of Communist party power, the continuing imperfections in Russia's economy, the strength of the mafia, and the increasing self-assertion of Russia on the world scene. Many point to the danger that Russia, humiliated by defeat in the Cold War and confused with economic turmoil, will turn to nationalism and corporatism, as Germany did in the 1930s.</p>
<p>In recent years such pessimism has dominated Western comment on Russia and much of the comment in Russia itself. Yet generally the gloomy forecasts have proved false. Instead there has been progress on most fronts--not in a tidy way, but usually by a process of two steps forward, one step back. The one step back is reported more than the two steps forward, consolidating the mood of gloom. </p>

Since the fall of the soviet empire in 1991, Westerners have been speculating about the future of its
vast and long-oppressive economy. Politicians, economists, and businesspeople alike have watched
with great interest as the new Russia has scrambled to get on its feet. As support for the communists
has waned and waxed, Westerners have worried: Are Russia's troubles merely the growth pains of a
rich new market waiting to take off? Or should businessmen and tourists stay away?
<p>The bottom line, argue Richard Layard and John Parker, is a healthy and strong one. Democracy and free markets have taken root in Russia for good. The authors offer a soup-to-nuts analysis of the Russian economy, along with its political and social underpinnings, to demonstrate just how successful the reforrns have been and what they mean for Western businessmen.</p>
<p>Layard and Parker argue that Russia has passed the crucial point of dependency on Boris Yeltsin; it has built a successful multiparty democracy; and it has passed through the worst of the economic aftershocks of communism. Inflation is finally under control, and with the growing success of privatization, many opportunities have emerged for both Russians and foreigners. Political shifts notwithstanding, Layard and Parker foresee a bright future for Russia, graced by strong economic growth, based on private enterprise. They argue that Russia's economy will grow faster over the next twenty years than most emerging markets, and that foreigners will reap good returns from investing in its markets and its amazing natural resources.</p>
<p>The Coming Russian Boom introduces Westerners to a Russia that is far healthier and more promising than the one they have read about in the papers, and shows how the greatest political-economic challenge of the post-Cold War world has become a resounding and exemplary triumph. It offers specific suggestions and guidelines for entrepreneurs, investors, and analysts. And it uses underlying economic structure to illuminate the surface confusion that will always be Russia. </p>

</i>
<p>A FEW years ago there was a swiftly banned craze among students in Beijing for <font size=-1>T</font>-shirts with striking designs and vaguely subversive slogans. "I'm depressed; let me alone" was the most popular. Another was more puzzling, but went to the heart of Chinese society. It showed the profile of an evil-eyed eagle, and a slang phrase, roughly translated as "pretend you didn't see." Life in China today relies on collective pretence. People have to feign forgetfulness of outrages they lived through; and they have to blink at continuing arbitrary injustice. The habit is so ingrained that there is genuine bewilderment at those who refuse to pretend.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Harry Wu, who spent 19 years in labour camps, was caught sneaking across the border into China in 1995, his captors seemed nonplussed. Here was a man with an American passport and a wife, a house and two cars in California. Why throw it all away simply to "make trouble" for the Chinese government?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or take Zheng Yi, a writer who, as a student, was one of Chairman Mao's red guards in the cultural revolution of the late 1960s. He became obsessed with stories that, in one part of China during the period, blood-letting had sunk into mass cannibalism. Even Liu Binyan, China's best and bravest investigative writer, had looked away from this horror.
Harry Wu has been accused of suffering from a "martyr complex" for insisting on returning to China when he was already a marked and hunted man. His defence is straightforward. The prison camps persist; they continue to ruin the lives not just of criminals but of those who simply disagree with the government. And he, Harry Wu, is very good at investigating them. His notoriety stemmed originally from television documentaries showing that goods made with convict labour were being exported to the United States, in contravention of American law. Because this is one area where the link between trade and human rights is undeniable, Mr Wu made plenty of trouble.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1995 he was caught up in another political squall, over Hillary Rodham Clinton's planned visit to the United Nations women's conference in Beijing. He became a hostage. The book is an account of his detention, interrogation, trial and cynically calculated release, interlarded with his life history. He is a hero of our times, and his story deserves to be heard.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Zheng's narrative makes harder reading. It is, in the full sense, disgusting. He tells how, in the Guangxi region of China, purge-victims in the cultural revolution were humiliated, beaten, tortured, killed--and then, in some cases, eaten. He meets unrepentant cannibals, who tell him barbecued human liver is delicious.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Zheng makes a valiant attempt to come to terms with how this could have happened. As a Han Chinese, he has to guard against explaining away the cannibalism as the peculiarity of the local ethnic group, the Zhuang (who, with some 60m people, form China's largest minority). Rather, he shows it to be a pattern of vicious lunacy gripping all of China.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Very few of the most guilty were properly punished. In factories and villages people live and work alongside those who, just a generation ago, persecuted them or their families. As Mr Wu notes, the cultural revolution, it seems, had "only victims". But some workers or peasants who got to university did well out of it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Zheng refers naturally to one of the best-known Chinese stories of the century, "Diary of a Madman", by a pre-revolutionary writer, Lu Xun. The madman is obsessed by China's "4,000-year history of cannibalism". Lu Xun meant it as a metaphor for an inhumane society, where only survival matters. It is the sort of society where, as Mr Wu is being deported to freedom, one of his guards tricks him out of $1,000, "for his air-ticket". Lu Xun's metaphor is all the more powerful for being sickeningly, literally, true.

THE BORDER
<p>The American passport was tucked into the pouch on my belt. Occasionally I would reach for it the way a cowboy in a Western movie might feel for his six-shooter, just to know it's there. Everybody wants an equalizer. It was June of 1995, and I was riding in a taxi through a remote corner of Kazakhstan, trying to slip into China. I felt a shiver- half-love, half-terror. My U.S. passport would not protect me if they caught me inside my homeland. China has a most-wanted list, and I was on it.</p>
<p>The real equalizer was the woman sitting next to me, the redheaded woman from North Carolina. She was my assistant, my eyes and ears, my insurance policy. With a native-born American alongside me, the Chinese authorities were less likely to shoot me in the back, leave me lying out in the desert somewhere. At least, that was my theory.</p>
<p>I had a video camera hidden in the black bag hanging from my shoulder, to document thousands of prisoners slaving in the fields, thousands of prisoners toiling in the factories, prisoners just like me years ago. Just a few more rolls of videotape-then maybe I would stop risking my life.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities do not like me, because I slip back into China and expose their labor camps. I put them on 60 Minutes for the prison-made goods they sell to rich countries. I put them on the BBC for the kidneys they scoop out of executed prisoners. The government does not appreciate the publicity.</p>
<p>I thought about my nineteen years in the camps, my entire twenties and thirties, when I could have been married and having children and working as a geologist, living my life. They broke my body, but they did not break my spirit. I told myself, "These sons of bitches stole my youth. They steal millions of lives. Now I will expose them to the world."</p>
<p>I was gambling with my life and with somebody else's life, too: Ching- Lee's-the beautiful wife I had had the fortune to meet five years before, when I was almost fifty-three. She was supposed to join me on the last leg of this trip. But first I needed a traveling companion who could back me up for ten days and then get out with the videotape. </p>

Jean Montaldo smashes several haloes in alleging corruption in a French charity dedicated to cancer research. ''Clovis'' has provoked still greater rows but you probably have to be French to comprehend them. Ultra-nationalists in France have sought to commandeer Clovis, a 6th-century monarch. This, in turn, has excited anti-clerical leftists to demonise their country's first Christian king.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British list is serene by comparison, with several highly inoffensive entries. Delia Smith's wholesome meals are so popular that her cookery books routinely outsell pulp fiction. Sister Wendy Beckett lives a contemplative life in a caravan when she is not gushing about pictures by old and new masters on television. Dava Sobel's study of longitude is scientific history at its exhilarating best. Dickie Bird, the subject of Brian Scovell's biography, is the best-loved cricket umpire in Britain.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Readers in Germany, it seems, are currently as enthusiastic about self-improvement as American readers are most of the time. Ute Ehrhardt gives German women emancipation tips; Alfred Biolek, a television personality, tells Germans of both sexes how to prepare stunning meals; an old American proponent of the feel-good factor, Dale Carnegie, tells them how to win friends and influence people; and Daniel Goleman, a new American feel-gooder, reassures them that even thick people can be smart.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 1996 presidential elections are not yet having much impact on American reading. Both political offerings on the list are fluffy: revelations from inside the White House from Gary Aldrich, an <font size=-1>FBI</font>agent, and reminiscences by Ed Rollins, a political operative, in a book that one reviewer called a ''raincoat-opener".<br><h3>Non-fiction bestsellers<a href="#foot">*</a></h3><ul><li><a href="#1">United States</a><li><a href="#2">Britain</a><li><a href="#3">France</a><li><a href="#4">Germany</a></ul></td></tr></table><a name="1"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4>United States</h4><ol><li> The Dilbert Principle 	<i> by Scott Adams	</i>. &#160; 	Management fads satirised	</li><li> Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus		<i> by John Gray	</i>. &#160; 	Relationships</li><li> Unlimited Access		<i> by Gary Aldrich	</i>. &#160; 	The Clintons behind closed doors</li><li> The Zone  		<i> by Barry Sears	</i>. &#160; 	 Where to take body and mind</li><li> Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms		<i> by Ed Rollins	</i>. &#160; 	The black arts of politics </li><li> Simple Abundance		<i> by Sarah Ban Breathnach	</i>. &#160; 	Comfort and joy for women</li><li> Bad As I Wanna Be		<i> by Dennis Rodman	</i>. &#160; 	Basketball's bad boy tells all</li><li> Outrage		<i> by Vincent Bugliosi	</i>. &#160; 	O.J.'s acquittal explained</li><li> The 5-Day Miracle Diet      		<i> by Adele Puhn	</i>. &#160; 	Slimming continues</li><li> Undaunted Courage      		<i> by Stephen Ambrose	</i>. &#160; 	How Jefferson backed explorers Lewis & Clark</li></ol></td></tr></table><a name="2"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4>Britain</h3><ol>				<li> Summer Collection		<i> by Delia Smith	</i>. &#160; 	Compendium of English recipes</li><li> Longitude 		<i> by Dava Sobel	</i>. &#160; 	18th-century saga of John Harrison's quest</li><li> In the Eye of the Storm		<i> by Patrick Cordingley	</i>. &#160; 	Desert Rats in the Gulf war</li><li> The Story of Painting		<i> by Wendy Beckett	</i>. &#160; 	Nun-turned-celebrity explains</li><li> Seven Spiritual Laws of Success		<i> by Deepak Chopra	</i>. &#160; 	Serving body and soul</li><li> War Walks: From Agincourt to Normandy		<i> by Richard Holmes	</i>. &#160; 	Military historian visits sites</li><li> Keeper of Genesis		<i> by Robert Bauval & Graham Hancock	</i>. &#160; 	Historical mysteries and the future</li><li> Open Skies, Closed Minds		<i> by Nick Pope	</i>. &#160; 	UFO threat to security</li><li> Dickie		<i> by Brian Scovell	</i>. &#160; 	England's favourite cricket umpire retires</li><li> Hitler's Willing Executioners       		<i> by Daniel Goldhagen	</i>. &#160; 	Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust</li></td></tr></table><a name="3"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4>France<a href="#foot">**</a></h3><ol>				<li> Le Gang du Cancer		<i> by Jean Montaldo	</i>. &#160; 	Corruption in a French charity</li><li> Clovis 		<i> by Michel Rouche	</i>. &#160; 	France's first Christian king in history and legend</li><li> La Travers&eacute;e		<i> by Philippe Labro	</i>. &#160; 	Intensive care and recovery </li><li> Rams&egrave;s II		<i> by Christiane Desroches-Noblecourt 	</i>. &#160; 	Bio of a pharaoh</li><li> Pendant les Affaires, les Affaires Continuent		<i> by Denis Robert	</i>. &#160; 	Chirac and Mitterrand, cover-up artists"</li><li> La Plus Belle Histoire du Monde		<i> by H.

</ul>


<p>HALFWAY through this conspiracy theorists' account of the life and reign of Pope John Paul II, one denizen of the large tribe of shadowy sources who people the book explains why the pope really joined what the authors call a secret "holy alliance" with Ronald Reagan to topple communism. "What this gave him," whispers the source, described as a deputy to an ex-secretary of state, Alexander Haig, "was that he felt he had a high-level intimate relationship with the world's most powerful country. He was a player."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Carl Bernstein, a reporter of Watergate fame, is a creature of Washington. Marco Politi, Vatican correspondent for <i>La Repubblica</i>, has an Italian insider's knowledge (and taste) for church machination. They retell the story of the young, devout Karol Wojtyla, tracing his growth into manhood during the second world war, his studies at a clandestine seminary and his ordination as a priest 50 years ago this month. "His Holiness" engagingly recounts how in 1978 a conclave of cardinals improbably chose a provincial Polish cardinal as the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. Accounts of his first trip to Mexico in 1979 and his triumphant return to Poland later that year are particularly vivid.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Trouble comes when the book lurches into "the hidden history of our time". This is a replay of the thesis Mr Bernstein first broached in <i>Time</i> in 1992, namely that America and the Vatican entered a covert alliance to overthrow communism and that their pact was sealed at a papal-presidential summit in 1982. As a follow-up, Vernon Walters, American ambassador-gadfy-at-large, and the then director of the <font size=-1>CIA</font>, William Casey, also met the pope.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Four years ago, Mr Bernstein's account brought denials from actors and observers alike in Washington, Warsaw and the Vatican. It even drew a papal disclaimer. That Mr Reagan and the pope shared a goal in Poland, or that they were both pleased by the collapse of "the evil empire" is beyond question. That they conspired together to achieve it--did they need to?--is unproven in this book.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More convincing is the authors' picture of the pope in the 1990s as an ill and ageing autocrat, sure in his achievements but beset by a sense of solitude: the passing of the communist devil has not brought the spiritual regeneration that he hoped for in Eastern Europe. Even Poles may now divorce and have abortions. More positively, they remember that he is also "the last of the giants on the global stage...the only international spokesman for universal values."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite its insights, this portrait is marred by hyperventilated writing, by over-reliance on unnamed sources, by reconstructed conversations that do not always ring true and by interpretation applied with a sledgehammer. There are some splendid images of a driven, holy man; some revealing glimpses of John Paul's conviction and his uncompromising character. But on balance, "His Holiness" is a flawed and unsatisfying book.

MOTHER
<p>In the telling, there was no pain. At the moment of birth, the mother asked the midwife to open the window so that the first sounds her newborn son heard would be the singing in honor of Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>And so the midwife sprang from the foot of the bed to the window and threw back the shutters. Suddenly the little bedroom was flooded with light and with the intonations of May vespers to the Blessed Virgin, from the Church of Our Lady, in the very month dedicated to her. And so the first sounds heard by the future pope, John Paul II, were hymns sung to Mary from the parish church directly across the street from where he was born, in a humble flat owned by Jews in the Galician town of Wadowice.</p>
<p>This was the story told by the old pope himself as he walked through the Vatican gardens in his seventieth year, contemplating the arc of his remarkable life and describing this great gift-t from his own martyred mother.</p>
<p>Karol Jozef Wojtyla was conceived in a time of war between newly independent Poland and Lenin's Soviet Republic. On May 7, 1920, in the last month of Emilia Wojtyla's pregnancy, the Polish forces of Marshal Jozef Pilsudski won their greatest military victory over the Red Army: the conquest of the Ukrainian city of Kiev. As the nation was swept up in the news from the front, Emilia engaged a midwife and prepared the tiny bedroom for her child. She was thirty-six years old, a frail woman, both emotionally and physically. Six years earlier she had lost a daughter, Olga, whether stillborn or in infancy is unknown. Her husband, age forty, a lieutenant in Pilsudski's army, was too old to go to the front, so he was able to help watch over their thirteen-year-old son Edmund during her difficult pregnancy.</p>
<p>On May 18, the day Emilia went into labor, Pilsudski made his triumphant return to Warsaw from the Ukrainian campaign. Thousands of Poles lined the streets waiting to greet the conqueror of Kiev as his special train, festooned with flowers, pulled into the station. Honor guards and mounted cavalry accompanied the marshal's horse-drawn carriage to the church of St. Alexander, where a mass of victory was to be celebrated and a magnificent choir would sing the "Te Deum." From the church, joyous students pulled Pilsudski's carriage to the Belweder Palace, passing through a grand arch inscribed "Hail to the Victor." For this was the day on which the Polish nation would proclaim to the world that it had regained its greatness.</p>
<p>It would be fifty-nine years before Poland would again experience a day of such joy and hope: fifty-nine years until the baby being born in the provincial town of Wadowice would return triumphantly to Warsaw as Pope John Paul II. From two of the world's greatest investigative journalists comes the fascinating story of the man who changed our century Pope John Paul II. </p>

With the same meticulous reporting skills and narrative excitement that went
into All the President's Men and The Final Days, Carl Bernstein and Marco
Politi provide an astonishing look at the foremost political figure of our time. In
their research, Bernstein and Politi have had unprecedented access to rare
sources of information in Rome, Washington and Moscow, including once top-
secret Soviet files. Through these documents, the reader gets a previously
impossible inside glimpse into the Soviet hierarchy and sees how they
recognized the serious threat John Paul II posed to their survival, even at the
start of his papacy. Startling Politburo minutes show Brezhnev, Andropov, and
other key figures heatedly discussing at length how to handle the Pope - even
within days of the nearly successful assassination attempt. Yet, John Paul
would come to dominate his time, ultimately fashioning an alliance with
Reagan to reverse Yalta and hasten the demise of Communism. Ironically, it
was not for his political instincts that he rose through the Church ranks, rather
he is the first prelate in history to rise to the papacy based on his work in the
field of sex -as writer, researcher and counsellor to young couples.
<p>His Holiness succeeds where other studies have failed at capturing the humanness of John Paul II. What also emerges is the unknown story of a boy who turned to God after losing all of his closest family. members and whose destiny was shaped by growing up in Nazi (and later Communist) Europe. As it examines the controversial man who has sent the Catholic Church on a course that has both divided and uplifted its billion members, His Holiness explains how his iron will and strong convictions have made him the great moral leader of our time. </p>

<p>THE titles say it out loud: trouble looms on and off the campus. It was not al ways so. As Christopher Lucas notes, America's universities were for long spared the barrage of outside criticism that its schools have had to put up with for most of this century. Arguments about the aims and content of higher education tended to be confined to the ivory tower itself--though from the 1960s on they became ever angrier. Not till the 1980s did outsiders really look hard at universities as they might at a business or a government department. An argumentative example was Charles Sykes's "Profscam", which accused academics of not teaching, of publishing unreadable waffle as "research" and of sacrificing scholarship to political correctness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Polemics aside, scrutinising the efficiency of universities is only reasonable. America alone has 14.5m students, nearly ten times the number in 1939. Its universities earn, on one estimate, $175 billion a year, making them twice as big a "business" as airlines.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Lucas traces higher education's tribulations to the late 19th century. Start-up capital came from industrial tycoons keen to create monuments to themselves. The intellectual capital came largely from Germany, especially from the liberal-arts model devised by Wilhelm von Humboldt, the founder of Berlin University. This model stressed the unity of research, scholarship and teaching. And it laid down a broad curriculum, from Latin to mathematics, that all students should follow in order to become cultured citizens.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles William Eliot's inauguration as president of Harvard in 1869 marked the start of a long decline for the liberal-arts ethos. To Eliot it was no longer realistic to try to define a single body of knowledge that all educated people should possess. Harvard students were allowed to pick courses that suited their interests and aptitudes. Powerful faculties grew up providing ever more specialised and job-related courses. To Mr Lucas this has gone too far. He cites evidence that today's bosses would rather employ "liberally educated generalists" than narrowly trained specialists, and he suggests ways to update the liberal arts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Bill Readings, such efforts are futile, since the German-inspired "university of culture" is beyond repair. Universities, he argues, are becoming indistinguishable from the transnational firms they do business with. They even issue vacuous "mission statements" that contain platitudes about striving for "excellence". He shares Mr Lucas's disdain for the bean-counting of this new "university of excellence", which treats students as customers, rather than as members of a scholarly community.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In an ever more provocative chain of argument, Mr Readings says that the Humboldtian model aimed to be "producer, protector and inculcator of an idea of national culture"; that the end is nigh for the very concept of national culture; that no "global culture" will emerge to replace it; and so, instead of trying to turn their institutions into the Sony or the Shell of the education industry, academics must learn to live meaningful lives among the ruins of the "university of culture".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Readings seeks to make a virtue of the current campus rows between traditionalists, multiculturalists, postmodernists and other -ists. The traditionalists will not, he says, be able to rebuild a consensus about what constitutes "culture" or even "truth". So he proposes that the new ideal should be the "university of dissensus", where academics accept that "the position of authority cannot be authoritatively occupied" and where questions are thrashed out without any expectation of answers. Unfortunately, that sounds rather like the Monty Python sketch, "Is this the right room for an argument?", where people are paid to argue for the sake of it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Edward Said makes a similar point in his essay in "The Future of Academic Freedom". He does not mourn the university's decline as a storehouse of national culture, because he has seen the damage that that idea has done to academic freedom in Arab universities. Where Mr Readings calls for "dissensus", Mr Said uses the happier image of an intellectual traveller, keen to visit new worlds, to use different idioms and to understand a variety of disguises, masks and "rhetorics".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His is one of nine essays on the future of academic freedom commissioned by the American Association of University Professors. Among the questions debated are: are universities endangered by the argument that there is no fundamental truth, independent of the human mind, or by the competing demands of those who want absolute free speech and those who want to curtail discussion of touchy issues?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Curiously, although the tension between free speech and the rights of ethnic minorities is discussed, these essays on academic freedom hardly touch on the difficulties faced by sociologists who attempt to conduct studies on alleged differences between races. Nor does any essayist tackle an important question posed by Mr Lucas. Tenured employment, he notes, was supposed to be the bulwark of academic freedom. But is it not now, he asks, more a threat to free speech, as junior academics parrot their elders' opinions so as to secure tenure for themselves?

AMERICAN ACADEME: AN OVERVIEW
<p>PATTERNS IN THE MOSAIC</p>
<p>The American system of higher education is not, strictly speaking, a true "system" in the usual sense of the term. That is, higher learning in the United States as a whole exhibits little of the structural logic, integration, or rational articulation of parts characteristic of a formal social system. Rather, the appearance it presents is one of a vast, untidy array of academic institutions, of widely different types and sizes, engaged in the pursuit of what often seem to be quite disparate goals. No succinct characterization can thus do full justice to the scope and breadth of post-secondary education throughout the nation. Seemingly chaotic, often bewildering in its variety and diversity, the country's institutionalized higher learning lends itself neither to sweeping generalizations nor to simple description. In the final analysis, it is a complex, multifaceted, and profoundly paradoxical phenomenon. To resort to a somewhat hackneyed metaphor, higher education in America suggests an elaborate mosaic, though one whose pieces reveal few predominating patterns.</p>
<p>Institutional aims or objectives and basic priorities are apt to differ tremendously from one American college or university to another. As observers are prone to remark, collegiate goals and functions often appear to overlap or even to stand in contradiction to one another. Linkages or connections between institutions. where they exist at all. seem fragmentary and incomplete. What colleges and universities offer way of instruction and courses of study, the ways in which their curricula are organized, the particular constituencies they seek to serve, and the specific purposes and values to which they bend their efforts vary markedly from institution to institution. In "ecological" terms, it might be observed, each seeks to identify its own separate "niche" in the larger scheme of things and thereby thrive within it.</p>
<p>Some two-year schools sponsor an associate arts degree within a fairly specific range of academic specialties or applied fields. Examples of the latter might include accounting, business practices and office machines, optometric technology, dental hygienics, paramedical or paralegal training, restaurant management, and so on. Many community colleges define themselves as so- called terminal institutions catering to the needs of students who do not aspire to earn four-year academic credentials. Their emphasis is heavily vocational or professional; and they measure success by the degree to which their graduates secure employment. Other two-year schools regard themselves primarily as "feeder" institutions providing an academic foundation for subsequent study pursued elsewhere toward a bachelor's degree. Still other community colleges try to fulfill both functions simultaneously, though the balance between them differs, depending on the individual institution.</p>
<p>Again, many colleges confer a four-year baccalaureate degree in one or another of the traditional liberal arts disciplines--in history, literature, foreign languages, psychology, geography, biology, and so on. Others also offer graduate-level professional training in a broad array of fields up through the master's level. Still others sponsor a comprehensive array of degree programs, ranging from a two-year certificate up to and including the doctorate in multiple specializations. Some colleges attract applicants on the basis of a particular specialization or field of study for which they have become especially well known. (Alfred University in New York, for instance, has long enjoyed repute as a center for the study of ceramic engineering. The University of Missouri and Columbia University, respectively, both have well-known journalism programs.) A school's reputation may come to depend chiefly on the excellence of the one or two programs to which it gives particular emphasis.</p>
<p>Special-purpose colleges or schools catering to a particular ethnic clientele are by no means unknown. But neither are they common. Historically. for example, in the United States there have been few Hispanic or Latino institutions of higher learning. In recent years, however. a handful have attracted enrollments consisting predominantly 81 Hispanics. Tribal colleges catering to the unique needs of Native </p>

Introduction
<p>Jeremiads abound concerning the "betrayal" and "bankruptcy" of the project of liberal education.' Teaching, we are told, is undervalued in favor of research, while research is less and less in touch with the demands of the real world, or with the comprehension of the "common reader." Nor is this--as some academics seem to believe--just the lament of the middlebrow media, motivated by media commentators' resentment at their failure to gain access to the hallowed groves of academe. Forever deprived of the chance to sit on the Faculty Promotions Committee, such pundits, it is claimed, take out their frustrations on the University, constrained as they are to content themselves with huge salaries and comfortable working conditions. The causes of the media's sniping at the University are not individual resentments but a more general uncertainty as to the role of the University and the very nature of the standards by which it should be judged as an institution. It is no coincidence that such attacks are intensifying in North America at the same time as the structure of the academic institution is shifting.</p>
<p>It is not merely that the professoriat is being proletarianized as a body and the number of short-term or part-time contracts at major institutions increased (with the concomitant precipitation of a handful of highly paid stars). The production of knowledge within the University is equally uncertain. An internal legitimation struggle concerning the nature of the knowledge produced in the humanities, for example, would not take on crisis proportions were it not accompanied by an external legitimation crisis. Disputes within individual disciplines as to methods and theories of research would not hit the headlines, were it not that the very notion of a research project is now a troubled one. Thus, the impulse behind this book is not simply to argue that the University needs to recognize that new theoretical advances in particle physics or literary studies render old paradigms of study and teaching obsolete. Nor is this book simply another attempt to engage with the web of conflicting and often contradictory sentiments that currently surround the University. Rather, I want to perform a structural diagnosis of contemporary shifts in the University's function as an institution, in order to argue that the wider social role of the University as an institution is now up for grabs. It is no longer clear what the place of the University is within society nor what the exact nature of that society is, and the changing institutional form of the University is something that intellectuals cannot afford to ignore. </p>

Not since student turmoil and unrest wreaked havoc on the nation's campuses
three decades ago has American higher education been the subject of so much
controversy and popular criticism. Vital issues confronting today's institutions
of higher learning include: admissions, student enrollment management,
curricular fragmentation, declining academic standards, the apparent erosion of
liberal learning within academe, neglect of undergraduate education in favor of
academic research, unprecedented financial woes, shifting campus priorities,
faculty tenure, the "publish or perish" syndrome, and renewed demands for
accountability.
<p>Confusion over fundamental priorities and purposes, the author argues, lies at the heart of the dilemma facing end-of-the-century higher education. Having failed in its attempt to be all things to all r people, the academy must now reinvent | itself to meet the challenges of the millennium ahead Thoughtful and timely,</p>
<p>Crisis in the Academy offers a wide-ranging analysis of contemporary higher education and makes an important contribution to the ongoing public debate over the future of America's beleaguered and diverse institutions of higher learning. </p>

IT IS NO LONGER CLEAR what role the University plays in society. The
structure of the contemporary University is changing rapidly, and we have yet
to understand what precisely these changes will mean. Is a new age dawning
for the University, the renaissance of higher education under way? Or is the
University in the twilight of its social function, the demise of higher education
fast approaching?
<p>We can answer such questions only if we look carefully at the different roles the University has played historically and then imagine how it might be possible to live, and to think, amid the ruins of the University. Tracing the roots of the modern American University in German philosophy and in the work of British thinkers such as Newman and Arnold, Bill Readings argues that the integrity of the modern University has been linked to the nation-state which it has served by promoting and protecting the idea of a national culture. But now the nation state is in decline, and national culture no longer needs to be either promoted or protected. Increasingly, universities are turning into transnational corporations, and the idea of culture is being replaced by the discourse of "excellence." On the surface, this does not seem particularly pernicious.</p>
<p>The author cautions, however, that we should not embrace this techno- bureaucratic approach too quickly. The new University of Excellence is a corporation driven by market forces, and, as such, is more interested in profit margins than in thought. Readings urges us to imagine how to think, without concession to corporate excellence or recourse to romantic nostalgia within an institution in ruins. The result is a passionate appeal for a new community of thinkers. </p>

<p>FAWNING histories of world statesmen can make bad reading; admiring ones are another matter. Archie Brown, who teaches politics at Oxford, sets out to put the record straight for the essentially tragic figure who freed Eastern Europe from the Soviet yoke and presided over the break-up of the Soviet Union.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mikhail Gorbachev has come in for much criticism since he was elbowed aside by Boris Yeltsin. How distant his <i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i> now sound; almost as quaint as the "evil empire". The argument that Mr Brown develops is that Mr Gorbachev was unique for a leader of his classic Soviet upbringing in ruling out the harsh use of force. Even when his disintegrating empire did act with some brutality, as it did in Lithuania, he is pictured, almost plausibly, as a victim of this bad behaviour, not its perpetrator.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most intriguing, certainly the murkiest, episode in this lively interpretation of Mr Gorbachev's role in a superpower's fall is the coup in Moscow that failed but nonetheless brought him down. Insinuations that Mr Gorbachev was a participant in the coup against himself or somehow condoned it have never quite been laid to rest. Mr Brown finds such charges "absurd".

<p>THAT Helmut Kohl deserves even more credit than he is commonly given for keeping his re-united Germany on the right (western) track is the theme of this ode to a chancellor who has just eclipsed Konrad Adenauer to become post-war Germany's longest-serving leader. Christian M&#252;ller, the Bonn correspondent of the <i>Neue Z&#252;rcher Zeitung</i>, makes much of how his hero secured Mr Gorbachev's agreement to allow a unified Germany to be a member of <font size=-1>NATO</font>, though in retrospect it is hard to see how the Russian could have prevented it, so weak was the hand he held.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kohl's detractors recall how he was still declaring, just months before the Berlin Wall fell, that he did not expect to see unification in his lifetime. It seems they do not know half the story. Mr M&#252;ller reveals that Mr Kohl had been working on unification since June 1989 (the wall came down in November) and broached the prospect of unification with Mr Gorbachev at a time when there was a real temptation to pave the way for it by making Germany neutral. Mr Kohl stoutly resisted the temptation and three months after the wall fell Mr Gorbachev was obliged to hand him the key to German unity with virtually no political strings attached.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One odd note is apparent in this elegant analysis of what happened in 1989-90 in Germany: the argument that Mr Kohl has always been underestimated jars during a period when he is being lionised--and perhaps getting even more credit than is his due.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In their book, David Schoenbaum, an American political scientist, and Elizabeth Pond, an American journalist, make the sharp-sighted point that during all the years when top Germans were protesting, along with Mr Kohl, that German unity was out of the question, they were really taking part in a national conspiracy not to alarm anybody, including themselves.

<p>LIKE Mr Kohl, Jawaharlal Nehru had the chance to build a nation. Considering the size of his task he did rather well, particularly when it came to establishing democracy in post-partition India. Mr Nanda is the founder of India's Nehru Memorial Museum so nobody would expect him to treat his subject harshly, but he certainly raises the big questions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Was Nehru an only half-serious foe of British imperialism who reverted to type (Oxbridge-educated, incurably pukka) before he had got the job done? Could he, with more patience, have prevented the sub-continent's partition when the British left in 1947? And was his determined promotion of non-alignment for India the irritating mistake that the West, and Russia too for that matter, thought it to be? From beneath most of the heavy questions that hang over his memory, Nehru emerges looking all right, heroic even--provided he is judged, as Mr Nanda demands, within the perspective of the ideas, assumptions and standards of his time, not with unforgiving hindsight.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The conflict at the heart of this study is Nehru's perplexing relationship with Mahatma Gandhi. Nehru at first "jumped" at the older visionary's solution of non-violence to redress India's problems, but later he grew impatient with it. Yet Nehru, independent India's first prime minister, never let their differences reach breaking point. His leadership was characterised by the caution which led him to install the new India in the British Commonwealth, so as to heal old wounds.

 Edited by R. Scott Appleby. <br>
<i>University of Chicago Press; 416 pages; $22.95 and &#163;15.95</i><br><p>THESE detailed portraits of "fundamentalist leaders of the Middle East" include Zionist zealots from Israel alongside Islamic extremists from countries ranging from Iran and Egypt to Lebanon and Sudan. As a guide to radical (mainly non-government) leaders in the Middle East, it serves its useful purpose all the better for being impartial.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite its weight of academic jargon, this collection edited by a historian at the University of Notre Dame reaches the down-to-earth conclusion that what is most divine about these extremists is their political nous. Fire and charisma are their stock in trade, yet they succeed by constantly weighing the religious inflexibility that their followers expect from them against the shifting demands of the political situation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apart from the late Ayatollah Khomeini and Sudan's Hassan Turabi, none of the figures portrayed here has had the chance to build a nation. All the same, this objective account deserves a place on the bookshelves at quaking chanceries throughout the Middle East.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
THE changes in what used to be the Soviet Union have been so I great that it is easy to forget
what the unreformed Soviet system was like and how modest were the expectations of
significant innovation when Mikhail Gorbachev succeeded Konstantin Chemenko as top
Soviet leader in March 1985. Neither Soviet citizens nor foreign observers imagined that the
USSR was about to be transformed out of existence. While no one predicted, nor would they,
all that was going to happen, those whose scepticism was greatest about the prospects for
change were the first to be overtaken by events. Some, who in more recent years have
castigated Gorbachev for his 'half-measures', have found it convenient to forget that the actual
changes promoted or sanctioned by Gorbachev exceeded their wildest dreams, making a
nonsense of predictions that he had neither the will nor the power to alter anything of
consequence in the Soviet system.
<p>When it became fashionable to react against the enthusiastic support for Gorbachev which was widespread in the late 1980s, the same observers who misread Gorbachev's intentions at the outset became the first to scorn an excessive concentration on the part played by Gorbachev while simultaneously, and with scant regard for logic, holding him personally responsible for all the major policy failures. And failures in the Gorbachev era there certainly were especially of economic policy and in the relationships between the Soviet Union's constituent republics and the centre.</p>
<p>If the scale of the change in the Soviet Union during the Gorbachev years is considered with dispassion, what is most remarkable is the extent to which it occurred peacefully. Given the failure of all who had openly attacked the system from within the country to make any positive impact on policy outcomes prior to the late 1980s, it is doubtful if change of such magnitude could have taken place with so little violence--especially in Russia--in any way other than through the elevation of a serious reformer to the highest political office within the country. The prospect of a reformer becoming General Secretary--the very idea that such a thing was possible in principle--had been ruled out in advance by many Western observers and by such prominent exiles from the Soviet Union as the writers Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Alexander Zinoviev. Yet, it was the great power concentrated in the hands of the Communist Party leadership collectively and the General Secretary individually which made it critically important that someone of reformist disposition should attain the latter office. Without the promotion of a genuine reformer and highly skilled politician to the top Communist Party post in 1985, fundamental change in the Soviet Union would certainly have been delayed and could well have been bloodier as well as slower than the relatively speedy political evolution which occurred while Gorbachev was at the helm. </p>

Mikhail Gorbachev was arguably the most important statesman of the second half of the
twentieth century. He played the decisive role in ending the Cold War and in allowing the
countries of Eastern Europe to regain their independence peacefully. He left Russia a freer
country than it had ever been. Although he failed in his attempts to turn the Soviet Union into
a genuine federation, he refused to resort to the repression that would have been needed to
preserve the USSR intact in the face of opposition from a number of its peoples.
<p>What kind of man made this massive difference to his own country, Europe, and the world? What were his views when he became Soviet leader and how did they evolve? Who and what influenced him? When did he move from being a reformer of the Soviet system to becoming the 'gravedigger' of Communism? How decisive for the dramatic changes of the last decade was the Gorbachev factor? In this masterly account, Archie Brown--a renowned authority on Gorbachev and the first Western scholar to predict his importance answers these questions in fascinating detail. Drawing upon a wide range of sources, including the memories (and memoirs) of those who worked most closely with Gorbachev, he combines acute political analysis with new information as he tells the story of Gorbachev's rise and fall--and of his less than seven years in power which changed the course of history. </p>

BISMARCKS SCHATTEN
<p>Die Wiederherstellung von Deutschlands Einheit in Freiheit und Frieden mit Zustimmung all seiner Nachbarn in Europa und Partner in der Weltpolitik war auf dem besten Wege, als Bundeskanzler Helmut Kohl am wI5. Juli I990 in Moskau sich zu einem entscheidenden Gesprach mit dem sowjetischen Staatschef Gorbatschow zusammensetzte. Das Treffen fand in der spatzaristischneogotischen Kaufmannsvilla an der Alexej-Tolstoj-StraBe statt, die schon vom Volkskommissar Tschitscherin kurz nach der Oktoberrevolution in ein Gastehaus der Sowjetregierung umgewandelt worden war. Tschitscherin war der Kontrahent von Reichskanzler Wirth und AuSenminister Rathenau bei den Verhandlungen am Rande der Konferenz von Genua im April I922 gewesen, die in den Uberraschungscoup des Vertrages von Rapallo mundeten.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Rapallo&lt;&lt; wurde das Schlagwort fur das plotzliche Zusammenspannen des Deutschen Reiches und Sowjetrul31ands als der beiden grol3en Verlierer des Ersten Weltkrieges und der Revisionsmachte gegen die problematische Friedensordnung von Versailles. Es galt seither als Schlusselbegriff fur eine stets von neuem auftauchende oder befurchtete Verlockung einer Separatverstandigung zwischen Deutschen und Russen ohne oder gegen die westlichen Demokratien. Der Hitler-StalinwPakt von I939 als Bundnis beider totalitarer Diktatoren, das die Entfesselung des Zweiten Weltkrieges durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland ermoglichte, mutete wie eine ins Verbrecherische gesteigerte Fratze der mit dem Rapallo-Pakt angestrebten Revisionspolitik nationaldeutscher Auspragung &gt;&gt;zwischen West und Ost&lt;&lt; an.</p>
<p>Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg und der Teilung Deutschlands geisterte dann gelegentlich in den Jahrzehnten des Wiederaufbaus und der Erstarkung der Bundesrepublik das Gespenst von Rapallo durch westliche Kanzleien. Mit zunehmend aktiver und auch autonomer &gt;&gt; Ostpolitik&lt;&lt; Bonns unter Willy Brandt und der sozialdemokratischliberalen Koalition verscharften sich zeitweise die Verdachtigungen trotz der von der deutschen Sozialdemokratie nach langem Zogern ubernommenen Politik Adenauers fur die entschlossene Westintegration der Bundesrepublik in die Atlantische All i anz m it Amerika und in den europaischen ZusammenschluB .</p>
<p>Im Sommer 1990, als das Traumziel von Konrad Adenauers Wiedervereinigungspolitik zum Greifen nahe schien, trubte da und dort im Westen nur noch ein leiser Verdacht einer Neuinszenierung von Rapallo die entscheidende Begegnung Helmut Kohls mit Michail Gorbatschow in Tschitscherins Moskauer Gastevilla. Deutschland war im Begriff, seine staatliche Einheit zu optimalen Bedingungen wiederzuerlangen, in Frieden und Freiheit sowie vor allem auch in voller Integration in der NATO und in der Europaischen Gemeinschaft. Amerikas Ruckhalt und Zustimmung waren dem deutschen Kanzler sicher. In engster Zusammenarbeit und Feinabstimmung mit Washington hatte Kohl alle Etappen des bis zum Galopp gesteigerten Wiedervereinigungsprozesses durchlaufen und dabei schlieBlich auch die anfanglich starken Bedenken in London und Paris weitgehend uberwunden.</p>
<p>Nun stand nur noch Gorbatschows Zustimmung zur vollen NAToMitgliedschaft des gesamten Deutschland aus. Der sowjetische Staatslenker, dem in Wahrheit die Zugel seiner ambitiosen &gt;&gt; Perestroika&lt;&lt;-Reform immer mehr aus der Hand glitten und der im folgenden Jahr im Zuge der volligen Auflosung des ganzen Sowjetimperiums sturzen sollte, hatte in monatelangem unschlussigen Lavieren und Improvisieren diese Zustimmung hinausgezogert. Dennoch war die deutsche Seite schon fruh, nicht zuletzt angesichts der sich dramatisch verscharfenden Wirtschaftsnote der Sowjetunion, zu einer Lageeinschatzung gelangt, die Moskaus Plazet fur die Zugehorigkeit Gesamtdeutschlands zum militarisch integrierten westlichen Bundnis als durchaus erreichbar betrachtete und erwartete. Besonders Bundeskanzler Kohl schien davon durchdrungen und zogerte bei aller Diskretion im offentlichen Umgang mit dem heiBen Eisen nicht mit geradezu zweckoptimistisch anmutender Zuversicht in dieser Frage. Gorbatschow deutete dann schon anderthalb Monate vor seinem Moskauer Treffen mit Kohl erstmals bei einem Amerikabesuch gegenuber Prasident George Bush seine Bereitschaft an, in der fur Deutschland und den Westen insgesamt existentiellen Bundnisfrage die groBe Konzession zu machen, die ein Jahr zuvor noch niemand auf der Welt fur moglich erachtet hatte. </p>

&gt;&gt;Man kann nicht selber etwas schaffen, man kann nur abwarten, bis
man den Schritt Gottes durch die Ereignisse hallen hort; dann
vorspringen und den Zipfel seines Mantels fassen - das ist alles.&lt;&lt;
Diesen Satz Bismarcks zitierte Helmut Kohl im Juli 1990 bei der fur die
deutsche Wiedervereinigung entscheidenden Begegnung mit dem
damaligen sowjetischen Staatschef Michail Gorbatschow in Moskau.
<p>Wie ein Motto steht das Bismarck-Zitat in den einleitenden Betrachtungen des Essays, mit denen Christian Muller in diesem Band nach der politischen Leistung des Mannes fragt, der zu Ende des Jahres 1996 auf die langste Amtszeit zuruckblicken kann, die je einem Kanzler der Bundesrepublik beschieden war, und der in der europaischen Epochenzasur von 1989/90 entschlossen und fahig war, die sich darbietende Chance handelnd zu nutzen. Damit zeigte Helmut Kohl sich &gt;&gt;auf der Hohe der Zeit&lt;&lt; - wie schon Anfang der achtziger Jahre wahrend der Kraftprobe mit dem Kreml in der Nachrustungsfrage.</p>
<p>Seit vielen Jahren beobachtet Christian Muller als Bonner Korrespondent der Neuen Zurcher Zeitung den sechsten deutschen Bundeskanzler aus nachster Nahe und zugleich mit dem kritisch wurdigenden Blick des auslandischen Kommentators.</p>
<p>Christian Muller sucht nach Helmut Kohls geistigen Wurzeln in dessen Bindung an jene Traditionen, die fur den Rheinlander aus der Pfalz mit den Namen Heidelberg, Hambach und Speyer verknupft sind und vom demokratischen Patriotismus des Ig.Jahrhunderts zuruckreichen bis in das &gt;&gt;pranationale mittelalterliche Reich europaischer Ausstrahlung&lt;&lt;. Heimat -Vaterland - Europa: dieses von Helmut Kohl immer wieder beschworene, historisch grundierte &gt;&gt; Triptychon&lt;&lt; ergabe kein bruchloses Bild ohne seinen Dank an den deutschen Widerstand, der die freiheitlichen Traditionen in die Zeit nach der nationalsozialistischen Herrschaft hinuberrettete.</p>
<p>Konrad R. Muller beweist mit den Bildern dieses Bandes erneut den aussergewohnlichen Rang seiner fotografischen Kunst. Die Aufnahmen dieses Bandes sind zwischen I989 und I996 entstanden und spiegeln als historische Dokumente Helmut Kohls politische Prasenz in Deutschland, Europa und der Welt wider. Als Bildnisse sind sie meisterhafte Studien der Personlichkeit, der faszinierende &gt; &gt;Versuch einer Annaherung&lt;&lt;, der auch bei Gelegenheiten, bei denen Konrad R. Muller als einziger Fotograf zugegen war, stets diskret bleibt. </p>

The Young Nationalist
<p>Jawaharlal was barely sixteen years old when he arrived at Harrow in 1905. Soon after his arrival he asked his father to send him an Indian newspaper, 'not the Pioneer.' In December 1905, he was pleasantly surprised to read in The Times that the Swadeshi movement had spread to Kashmir, where the people were reported to have bought up, by public subscription, all the English sugar and burnt it. 'The movement must be very strong indeed,' he wrote to hisfather, 'if it reached even the Kashmiris'.</p>
<p>Jawaharlal read the proceedings of the Indian National Congress with particular interest. When his father wrote from Calcutta that the Moderates and the Extremists had been at loggerheads in the 1906 Congress, he was disappointed. 'I am sorry to hear,' he wrote, 'that the Congress was not a success. I am impatiently waiting for your next letter to know the result of the proceedings. I do hope the different parties worked smoothly together, and there were no dissensions among the delegates. A most foolish thing this seems to me; for not only do they do no good to themselves but they do harm to their country they both pretend to serve. There couldn't have been any great difference or disagreement among the delegates, as our friends the Anglo-Indians would hardly have failed to wire the fact over here.'</p>
<p>Such passionate nationalism may seem surprising in an Indian boy of seventeen studying in an English public school, whose home in Allahabad was one of the most anglicized, whose father was an admirer of British ways and British institutions, and counted high British dignitaries among his friends. However, we must remember the great gulf which, at the turn of the century, divided the British and the Indian, the rulers and the ruled. Educated Indians had not forgotten the hysteria of the European community during the agitation over the Ilbert Bill, when Lord Ripon was ridiculed as a 'White Baboo', and a correspondent of the Englishman could seriously assert that 'the only people who have any right to India are the British; the so-called Indians have no right whatsoever'. Not only were Indians excluded from responsible posts in the administration of their own country; they received frequent and galling reminders of their inferior status. Compartments in railway trains and benches in public parks were reserved for Europeans only'. Long before the word was coined, 'apartheid' was practised by the most fashionable clubs in the principal towns of India. Many of them did not admit 'natives' even as guests; in Bombay and Calcutta it was not uncommon for an Indian gentleman to wait in the carriage, while his European wife went into the club. Nevinson, the noted British journalist, wrote after his visit to India in 1907-8 that there were in every part of the country Englishmen who 'still retained the courtesy and sensitiveness of ordinary good manners But one's delight in finding them proved their rarity.' It was a significant commentary on racial prejudice that, right through the First World War, the Baden-Powell organization refused to admit Indian children as scouts. All this deeply hurt proud and sensitive members of the intelligentsia. Intellectually, they might feel equal, or even superior, to individual Europeans, but socially they were branded as an inferior race. No wonder the western-educated middle class passionately longed for what an Australian writer has called 'freedom from the white man's contempt'. </p>

Jawaharlal Nehru, adulated during his lifetime, first as the most
charismatic leader of the Congress party during India's freedom
struggle and subsequently as independent India's first Prime Minister,
has in recent years suffered ill-informed denigration. This book seeks to
restore a balance by providing a well-rounded picture of Nehru the man
and statesman and by placing his career within the social milieu and
political context of his times.
<p>This re-evaluation focuses particularly on significant aspects of Nehru's life. The author traces the development of Nehru's nationalist ideas, and discusses his interaction with significant personalities of his time such as his father Motilal Nehru, Gandhi, Bose and Azad. Other important and controversial topics covered include Nehru's attitude to Partition, economic planning, administration, and non-alignment, as well as his relations with the British. A concluding overview brings together the complex strands of Nehru's multi-faceted personality and career.</p>
<p>For those who recall with nostalgia the chief architect of India as a strong, democratic, secular nation-state who was heard with respect in international fora, as well as for those who know little about him apart from the carping accounts of his critics, this cannot but prove a fascinating and revealing account of Nehru's life and times. </p>

<p>MULTIMEDIA is supposed to be great for children, but can infotainment do the classics? These two ambitious attempts at the art of classic story telling could not be more different. Microsoft's re-telling of Rudyard Kipling's "How the Leopard Got His Spots" is so speckled, sprottled and spottled with success that it will be the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> to beat for some time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reading classic stories to children is a sublime pleasure of parenthood, made all the more exciting when the little darling in your lap is absorbed in the words and images. How can computers compete? Lesson number one is to stick close to the original poetic prose. Danny Glover's reading of nearly the full text of the "Just So" story is magnificent. Barely a phrase is lost. Mr Glover relishes the "catty-shaped", "jumpsome", "patchy-blatchy", "slippery-slidy" phrases and positively delights in reminding children that "calling names won't catch dinner".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In "Recess in Greece", by contrast, Odysseus from "The Iliad" is a smart-alecky, street-wise American kid. Hermes the messenger god is a Hell's Angel biker, Zeus is a gunslinger from the American west, Apollo is a 1960s rock star and the Spartan war with Troy is depicted as an American football match. No poetry here. Programs are interspersed with games, including a game to match scattered images.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft, much more imaginatively, presents the challenge of matching snippets of African music. In fact, it is music that holds lesson number two. Microsoft added to the story-telling experience by hiring Ladysmith Black Mambazo, a South African group. Its music provides a sometimes haunting, often funny and always strong thread through "The Leopard". Homer's tale is supposed to be reinforced by cute snippets of modern music or jazzed-up Greek tunes but Microsoft has shown Morgan Interactive what every composer for the ballet knows: the music must enrich and sustain the story.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both programs have the obligatory hot spots. A click of the mouse transforms objects in unexpected ways, but our seven-year-old co-reviewer was already wise to the tricks of transformation. Where Microsoft scores is in its beautiful, vivid drawings by Lori Lohstoeter. Her art is inspired by the marvellous African exhibits in New York's Metropolitan Museum. The supporting pictures and video come from Britain's National Trust, the <font size=-1>BBC</font>, the American National Geographic Society, the Smithsonian Institution and other authoritative sources.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A third lesson, already evident in earlier Microsoft <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s for children, is to make sure there is something for the parents. The subtle anti-racism message of "The Leopard", even its gentle debunking of vegetarian obsessions, have no parallel in "Recess in Greece". Adults do get to brush up on their Greek gods, but the hipness of the characters makes it hard to trust what you are seeing. In humour it is no contest. Kipling and Microsoft win hands down.

<h2>My news or yours?</h2>
<p><b>Can personalisation save you from drowning in newsprint?</b><p>THINK of your daily newspaper as all the pizzas on your home-delivery menu: you order one, you get them all. Two-dozen boxes arrive with each order. You hate ham, anchovies, mushrooms, artichokes and so on, and you routinely throw them away. You keep the four-cheese and the margarita. Simpler, surely, to place an order. That, in essence, is the idea behind the <i>Daily Me</i>, the stock name for personalised newspapers on the net. You tell the "publisher" what your daily interests are; you get that and only that.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It sounds sensible. But does personalisation work? One problem is delivery. The idea of customising newspapers pre-dates the net. But, with newsprint, cost made it unworkable. Knight-Ridder, a big American newspaper chain, spent years of research on the so-called "tablet", a hand-held screen, which would combine the best features of an electronic newspaper and a conventional, print-based one. The idea proved futuristic. Knight-Ridder cancelled it in August 1995 and has since focused electronically on publishing through the net.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another problem is pre-selection from the mass of raw information hitting newspaper offices. Normally, news editors sort this out. Can their decision-processes be programmed? These involve news-sense, a nose for puffery, knowing when two stories are the same and other quick hunches needed to sort out press releases, trade promotions and wire feeds. These may be programmable one day. They are not programmed yet. Are then editors dispensable? Without them readers get the all-or-nothing pizza-problem back again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And then there is the question of the <i>Daily Me</i> against the <i>Daily Us</i>. A good newspaper is a newspaper readers associate themselves with. It has a character, a personality. It takes people out of their own world. The <i>Daily Me</i> is solipsistic, satisfying the interests of a community of one. Such communities exist only in the imagination. The premise that people's tastes and interests are so different that each would demand unique menus is false. The image of billions of readers with distinct, customised newspapers is techno-fiction. Conformists, by definition, are commoner than eccentrics.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That said, tastes and interests do differ enough to create market chances. The net offers an ease of choice from among the contents of normal papers that big publishers, and some small ones, are trying to exploit--or would be trying if they could figure out more reliably how to charge for them. Here is a selection of <i>Daily Me</i>sites:

<p><i><b>The Times (London)</i></b>&#160;&#160;<a href="http://www.the-times.co.uk/">http://www.the-times.co.uk/</a><p><font size=-1>Name: </font>Personal Times <br><font size=-1>Represented by:</font> Dour-faced butler<br><font size=-1>Sources:</font><i>The Times</i> and <i>Sunday Times</i><br><font size=-1>Cost:</font> Free

Instead of filtering junk mail, <i>Infosage</i> generates it, despatching dozens of industry-specific "stories" each day (many of them raw, repetitious news releases).<hr size=5 width=170 align=left><p><i><b>Los Angeles Times</i></b>&#160;&#160;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/">http://www.latimes.com/</a><p><font size=-1>Name: </font><i>Hunter</i><br><font size=-1>Represented by:</font> A cute golden retriever masquerading as a poodle<br><font size=-1>Sources: </font><i>LA Times</i>, Associated Press wire services<br><font size=-1>Cost:</font> Free<p>This retriever is perhaps too good at his job, dragging snippets out of the <i>LA Times</i> and sticking them (clumsily) next to identical ones from the Associated Press.<hr size=5 width=170 align=left><p><i><b>Adaptyx</i></b>&#160;&#160;<a href="http://www.daptyx.com/">http://www.daptyx.com/</a><p><font size=-1>Name: </font><i>Rex</i><br><font size=-1>Represented by:</font> Bespectacled, golden tyrannosaurus rex<br><font size=-1>Sources:</font> General news sources on the Internet<br><font size=-1>Cost:</font> Free
<i><p>Rex </i>uses wire services directly from the net. He tends to avoid trivial stories and once he finds something you like, he brings other reports of the same event.

The three sides of the triangle, according to Mr Calder, are rapidly growing economies, leading to shrinking energy resources and an arms race. This he sees as a formula for conflict. Some of Mr Calder's worries may be overdone. It is not obvious that East Asians face an energy crisis. Higher prices will encourage China and Indonesia to use power more efficiently. Japan has been doing so for some time. Asian arms purchases, again, are lower than in the 1980s and military spending is not growing as a percentage of <font size=-1>GDP</font>.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The greater risks in Asia lie in the internal pressures for change that are reshaping priorities among big and middle-sized countries. As befits the holder of the Japan chair at Washington's Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Mr Calder is at his best when explaining why Japan will grow more assertive as Asia becomes less predictable and the United States less involved. His analysis of the domestic roots of instability in China, Korea, Taiwan and several South-East Asian states is astute.</td></tr></table><a name="2"></a><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left width=60><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td valign=top><br><hr size=5 width=170 align=left>C<font size=-1>OLLISION </font> C<font size=-1>OURSE</font>:<br> A<font size=-1>MERICA</font> <font size=-1>AND</font> E<font size=-1>AST</font> A<font size=-1>SIA</font> <font size=-1>IN</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> P<font size=-1>AST</font> <font size=-1>AND</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> F<font size=-1>UTURE</font>.<br> By Bryce Harland. <br><i>Institute of Southeast Asian Studies; 230 pages; $29.90</i><p><a href="10ex305.html">Extract</a> - <a href="10jb305.html">Jacket Copy</a> - <a href="10bt305.html">Biography</a><br><p>A FORMER New Zealand ambassador to both Washington and Beijing sees collision looming between Asia and America.

This was a man-made famine, and the men who made it were the political parents of those now in power in China. Astoundingly, Jasper Becker, another China-based British journalist, is the first to write a full account of one of this century's great horrors. Passionately but precisely, Mr Becker records the tragic results of one of the boldest example of Utopian engineering ever attempted--one that included trying to abolish money and property and promised people's communes instead. The careful academic tones are mixed with horrific eyewitness accounts.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Becker urges readers to understand the roots of depraved policies that, although similar to those carried out in Stalin's Soviet Union, have received far less attention. He also recounts how--as with the Soviet Union's great famine--a great many western "experts" missed what was going on (J.K. Galbraith, Barbara Ward, Joseph Needham, Gunnar Myrdal) and instead showered praise on a Chinese regime that supposedly kept its people from famine.</td></tr></table><a name="5"></a><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left width=60><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td valign=top><br><hr size=5 width=170 align=left>D<font size=-1>ICTIONARY</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> M<font size=-1>ODERN</font> P<font size=-1>OLITICS</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> S<font size=-1>OUTHEAST</font> A<font size=-1>SIA</font>.<br> By Michael Leifer. <br><i>Routledge; 304 pages; &#163;16.99</i><br><p>DESPITE a conscious effort to promote a regional identity, each of the ten countries of South-East Asia has a distinctive and complex political structure and recent history. Mr Leifer has updated a guide of enormous use to businessmen, diplomats, students and journalists. The dictionary provides a succinct and reliable source for a quick mugging-up on personalities, parties and policies in the individual countries, as well as on the bewildering and acronym-infested process of regional co-operation. Its concerns range from <i>abangan</i> (the name given to Javanese who practise a syncretic form of Islam) to <font size=-1>ZOPFAN</font> (<i>"</i>the Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality<i>"</i>, announced in 1971).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dictionary's most obvious home is the briefcase of the visitor to the region, seeking a map through the political minefields. But a bigger market should be South-East Asia itself, where many countries admit they are short of experts in the affairs of their neighbours. It is hard to think, for example, of a South-East Asian scholar who could have produced such a panoramic work. That is also in part a result of timidity. Frank writing about other countries' internal affairs has a price (the first edition of the book, for example, was banned in Malaysia).</td></tr></table><a name="6"></a><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left width=60><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td valign=top><br><hr size=5 width=170 align=left>I<font size=-1>NDIA'S</font> E<font size=-1>CONOMIC</font> R<font size=-1>EFORMS</font> 1991-2001.<br> By Vijay Joshi and I.M.D. Little<br><i>Oxford University Press; 296 pages; &#163;25 and $36</i><p>THIS study is probably the most cogent account so far of India's economic reforms since 1991, and of the debates within the country on the changes.

ARMS RACE ASIA?
<p>Far more Americans have died in Asian battle over the past half century--from Saipan and Okinawa to Pork Chop Hill and Khe Sanh--than in any other part of the world. Yet we persist in our view of Asia as a prosperous, placid region. Quietly, however, a new danger zone has been rising, with global implications.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s the Middle East began arming itself with the windfall profits from oil price increases. Now Asia, with its newfound affluence as the world's lowest-cost and highest-quality manufacturer, is devoting much of its windfall profits to arms. Growth and emerging energy shortages are giving birth-to dangerous new tensions. These build on ancient antagonisms, the residue of the Cold War, and the rising sophistication of local technology to spur a strategic competition with disturbing implications for the new century now looming.</p>
<p>Pacific Defense for the United States in the Cold War years conventionally meant blunting Communist inroads by forward deploying American forces in Asia, and supporting local stability and prosperity. It must also now confront a broader and more complex challenge: neutralizing the local tensions, insecurities, and shortages flowing from the explosive regional growth of recent years. These tensions could well spiral into buildups and new political orientations ultimately threatening nations far beyond Asia.</p>
<p>The old tools of Pacific Defense have been military, combined with liberal Asian access to U.S. markets. The new tools, to address redefined imperatives, may well have to vary also. A vigorous American-Pacific presence--economic as well as military--remains crucial. Better access to Asian markets for foreign business is clearly needed. But hybrid, cooperative economic and security measures--on American initiative--to dampen regional rivalries, increase dialogue, and deal with shortages are crucial needs not yet adequately addressed. For as the tortured road to Pearl Harbor snowed so clearly, Asia is at its most turbulent and dangerous to the broader world when it is insecure.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of Asian insecurities, both economic and political, to provoke regional tension in the present or the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>With the Cold War behind us, most nations around the world are slashing armaments. The United States, for example, cut its defense expenditures during the 1989-94 period by over $37.8 billion, or nearly 13 percent. Russia, in the face of simultaneous economic and political collapse, cut even more sharply, by over 43 percent. The Middle East has also seen major retrenchment, with Israel's share of GNP devoted to defense falling by half since 1985, and Saudi Arabia's by over a third, despite an enormous upsurge during the Gulf War.</p>
<p>East Asia is a sharp, disturbing exception to these positive trends in global hot spots. Almost every nation in the region save Vietnam, which already had 700,000 men under arms and one of the most formidable arsenals on earth, increased its defense spending by a third or more during the past decade. Several in Northeast Asia have done so in the last five years alone. </p>

ASIAS DEADLY TRIANGLE
<p>Asia with its stunningly successful political economy threatens to become a military danger zone--with global implications In Asia's Deadly Triangle, Kent E. Calder, director of US-Japan Relations at Princeton, shows how a combination of highspeed economic growth, impending energy shortages, and political insecurity could well provoke an accelerating arms buildup and deepening geopolitical rivalries.</p>
<p>The Asian region has significantly increased its arms spending, now higher than that of post-Soviet Russia. Asian nations, including India, are rapidly developing new long-range strike capacities as legions of new missiles and aircraft become operational. This 'Arms Race Asia' is troubling not only for its pace--rapid even by classic Middle Eastern standards of the 1960s and 1970s - but also for its alarmingly high technological level The build up is fuelled by the economic as well as strategic interest of local Asian arms producers, whose deadly exports of Silkworm and Rodong missiles provoke instability throughout the world</p>
<p>Kent Calder explores the linkage between the area's economic growth and its extreme lack of energy resources - it is the world's largest energy importer - and how these energy insecurities are leading Asia swiftly towards a struggle for offshore oil and the subtle dangers that regional energy dependence on the Middle East may bring. The author shows how close Japan is to having nuclear weapons, and speculates on the capacities of North and South Korea, China and Taiwan, pointing out the possible links between efforts to acquire civilian nuclear power and the potential for nuclear armament.</p>
<p>With regional energy shortages as a result of high growth, the attractiveness of nuclear energy grows in Asia, even as it declines elsewhere. As Calder notes, the US Department of Energy projects that nearly half the increase in the entire world's nuclear energy production by 2010 will be in East Asia. These plants will most likely produce dangerous amounts of plutonium, a key raw material for nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Compounding the energy-related security dangers in Asia are troubling geostrategic uncertainties Surrounding Japan, in a prospective Northeast Asian Arc of Crisis, are heavily armed nations--notably the two Koreas, China and Taiwan--whose foreign relationships, like their domestic futures, are highly uncertain. Their courses threaten to interact with that of the troubled Japanese economic superpower to produce challenges to security and diplomacy rivalling those of the Middle East and Eastern Europe in past generations.</p>
<p>The history of this region is laden with conflict, and the author succinctly explains how these tumultuous age-old relationships will affect the area's volatility today He provides a dynamic overview of where each country is headed politically, and states definitively what role the West should play in these developments </p>

CHAPTER 1
<p>The West Strikes Asia</p>
<p>In the middle of the 19th century, a storm struck East Asia. It arose in the West, and came at first mainly from Britain. The role of America was subsidiary, but it grew as the storm went on, and helped to spread it. In the 20th century, America was to have much the greater impact on Asia, and Asia on America. But until about 1900 Europe set the pace.</p>
<p>Europeans and Asians had been in touch with each other for a long time. Herodotus mentions a Greek called Aristeas of Proconnesus who travelled to Central Asia in the 5th century BC and heard about a people called the Hyperboreans 'who reach to the sea'. If these were the Chinese, it is interesting that, according to Aristeas, each of the peoples he encountered encroached on its neighbour, except the Hyperboreans. There is no written record of any direct contact in classical times. Alexander's career of conquest took him and his armies as far east as Afghanistan and Pakistan, but he seems not to have heard of China. It was the Chinese who made the expeditions to Central Asia that led to the opening of the silk trade, probably in the 1st century BC. The Romans came to love silk, and were willing to pay for it with gold and silver, even when it became clear that this was affecting their own economy. The trade prospered, as did the peoples along the silk route, until some Persian monks of the Nestorian faith (an Asian form of Christianity) smuggled the eggs of the silk worm out of China in the 6th century AD, and silk production began in the Levant. Contact between Europe and Asia seems to have fallen off, especially after the eruption of Islam in the 7th century. The backward remnant of the Roman Empire in the West was left isolated and embattled, but slowly rallied round the Church, and began to fight back. The Crusades led the Papacy to look for allies in Asia, about the time when the conquests of the Mongols, led by Chinggis Khan, were opening Central Asia to Europeans again.</p>
<p>In 1245, the Pope sent a Franciscan friar to make contact with the Mongols, and he did so at the Great Khan's headquarters at Karakoram in Mongolia. On his return to Europe, King Louis IX of France sent another friar, who also got to Karakoram. In his report, he for the first time identified 'Cathay' with what the Romans had called 'Seres'. Merchants followed friars. Two Venetians named Polo also visited the Great Khan, who asked the Pope through them to send a hundred missionaries to his court. The Papacy did not respond immediately, but the Polos were sent back, with another letter. This time, they took with them the young son of Nicolo. Marco Polo attracted the attention of Kubilai Khan, by then established in China, and stayed for 17 years working for the Emperor. When he eventually returned to Italy, he gave Europe the fullest account it had yet had of China, and told it for the first time of Japan. By then, the Papacy had taken up Kubilai's invitation and sent yet another Franciscan, John of Monte Corvino, to establish a permanent mission in China. Others joined him, and two substantial missions were set up. They thrived, until the Chinese rebelled against the Mongols and drove them out of China in the mid-14th century. The Christians, and other foreigners they had brought in to help them rule the Chinese, went with them. Trade apparently went on, though mainly through intermediaries like the Arabs. It may have served other purposes too. Printing with movable type seems to have been invented in Korea about 1400: it appeared in Europe about 1440, though there is no conclusive evidence that it came from Asia. Contact between Europe and Asia had disappeared from sight. </p>

American is drifting towards another collision with Asian countries. This book
sets the situation in perspective by tracing the development of relations between
them during the last two centuries. No longer needing allies as it did during the
Cold War, the United States is now using its economic power to force them to
open their markets to its exports and to move towards Western democracy.
American pressure is making Asians appreciate what they have in common,
and helping to overcome the divisions that have kept them dependent on
outside powers.
<p>But collision is not inevitable. America has played a critical part in the transformation of East Asia. It still has much to teach, and it now has much to learn as well. By studying Asian experience, Americans can re-learn the importance of self-discipline, and face Asian competition without relying on their power and resorting to protectionism. APEC shows the way for the United States and other Western countries to benefit from the fast growth of Asian economies, and make the whole Pacific area more prosperous. </p>

Rivers of Blood
<p><ul> If some so-called democratic fighters seize power, they'll start fighting among themselves. As soon as civil war breaks out there'll be rivers of blood. What would be the point then of talking about 'human rights'? --Deng Xiaoping to Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 1990</ul></p>
<p>The visitor to China could be forgiven for thinking that Tiananmen is forgotten. China has a remarkable ability to cover up its wounds. The physical reminders of Tiananmen were quickly erased after the event. Within a few weeks of the bloodshed most of the scars left by bullets on the facades of buildings had been patched up. Flagstones charred by fires and chipped by armored vehicles had been replaced on the square itself. By mid-1994 when I left China, the only tangible evidence of the military action was the barely visible imprints of tank tracks on the tarmac of Changan Boulevard near where it intersects Tiananmen. You had to listen carefully for the faint, eerie hum produced by the tires of your vehicle as they passed over the indentations. The unknowing visitor might see Beijing's lavish new department stores, its open-air restaurants, and its busy, well-stocked markets and believe that everything was back to normal.</p>
<p>Some observers argue that China's fast-growing prosperity since Tiananmen has helped to blot out memories of the bloodshed and ensure social stability. Suppressing memories is one thing but erasing them is quite another. I believe that anyone directly involved in the upheaval of 1989--and there are tens of millions of such people in Beijing and other cities around the country--remains profoundly affected by the experience. Those tumultuous seven weeks generated more heartfelt, sustained emotion in China than any other event since the Cultural Revolution. These feelings will take a very long time to dissipate. No matter how successful the economy, no matter how affluent they may become, many Chinese will long continue to want revenge or at least a public acknowledge by the leadership that what the demonstrators did in 1989 was right.</p>
<p>The economic boom since Tiananmen may have blunted the demands of some for radical political change. But the very boom itself has caused such social and political dislocation that, I believe, the potential for large-scale unrest has increased. Tension between the old order and the new economic structures and interest groups emerging from it shows no sign of diminishing as China's rapid transformation continues. By the mid-1990s many Chinese observers were both in private and, to an increasing extent, in open publications expressing the same opinion.</p>
<p>Tiananmen was a watershed in Chinese history. It has had an enormous impact on China's foreign and domestic policy and continues to do so. It was with Tiananmen and the collapse of communism in Europe in mind that Deng Xiaoping launched the new economic reform campaign of 1992, which caused a surge of economic growth and triggered an explosion of entrepreneurial activity. He gambled that giving people more opportunity to make money would make them less inclined to take to the streets demanding democracy as they had done in 1989. It was because of Tiananmen and the diplomatic isolation it suffered as a consequence that China decided to seek a new accommodation with the West. Beijing abandoned its policy of refusing to discuss human rights. It decided to avoid confrontation with fellow permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and tacitly to accept Washington's preeminence in the post-Cold War order This was in spite of its continuing disputes with the United States over a host of issues, including human rights, bilateral trade, and dealings with Taiwan. </p>

Has Deng Xiaoping's great gamble paid off? Has the rush towards prosperity
brought stability to China or is the country's economic transformation fueling
instability? James Miles, who was the BBC's Beijing correspondent from 1988
to 1994, argues that China today remains at least as unpredictable and volatile
as it was at the outset of the Tiananmen Square protests.
<p>China's economic boom has enthralled the world and brought unprecedented prosperity to millions of Chinese. But as Deng's enemies within the Communist Party have often warned, it has aggravated social tensions and weakened the party's grip. The gap between rich and poor and between rural and urban areas is widening. Corruption is flourishing among officials who, seeing collapse of communism elsewhere, have lost faith in their party's future. On the basis of extensive interviews with officials, ordinary citizens, and intellectuals, the author concludes that China in the late 1990s is a country deeply unsure of where it is going. Politicians and public alike are asking themselves whether China is emerging as a new economic superpower with global influence to match, or if it is heading toward the chaos they so much fear. In the coming years, the answer to this question will have major implications for the outside world . With a population four times that of the Former Soviet Union, a China in turmoil would have colossal impact on some of the world's most successful economies on its rim, especially Hong Kong and Tiawan. </p>

<p>JAMES REDFIELD'S "The Celestine Prophecy" has spent nearly three years on American bestseller lists and 6m copies are in print worldwide. What is the secret? The story is a helter-skelter chase to recover an ancient Mayan manuscript that contains life-enhancing, but establishment-menacing, advice about meditation and self-fulfilment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The New Age American hero, a youth counsellor and no Stallone, must gather the scattered bits of the precious text before the Peruvian (sic) government stops him. Ranged against him, more threateningly, are the Catholic church and the world's scientific establishment, each afraid that the Mayan revelation will destroy their authority.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The nine Mayan insights have a distinctly modern ring. They are a mix of self-help and spiritualist (or surrealist) science: remember that society involves selfish egos; don't ignore coincidences; pay attention to energy fields; if stuck, meditate (it even makes you invisible). The Mayans apparently knew all this before their mysterious disappearance centuries ago. Indeed, they spirited themselves away by meditation to a parallel universe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The Story of B" also uses adventure to push an antinomian outlook. "B" is for blasphemy, here the belief that nature matters as much as man. When not dodging murderous attacks from Catholic friars, the book's tree-hugging heroes preach vivid animist sermons.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Interestingly, these writers differ on the future. Mr Redfield (or his hero) thinks western civilisation must move up to a higher, scientific-spiritual plane. Rejecting progress, Daniel Quinn (or his animists) see a return to pre-scientific belief as the key to human survival. Is the publisher hedging bets, or just segmenting the market?

A CRITICAL MASS
<p>I drove up to the restaurant and parked, then leaned back in my seat to think for a moment. Charlene, I knew, would already be inside, waiting to talk with me. But why? I hadn't heard a word from her in six years. Why would she have shown up now, just when I had sequestered myself in the woods for a week?</p>
<p>I stepped out of the truck and walked toward the restaurant. Behind me, the last glow of a sunset sank in the west and cast highlights of golden amber across the wet parking lot. Everything had been drenched an hour earlier by a brief thunderstorm, and now the summer evening felt cool and renewed, and because of the fading light, almost surreal. A half moon hung overhead.</p>
<p>As I walked, old images of Charlene filled my mind. Was she still beautiful, intense? How would time have changed her? And what was I to think of this manuscript she had mentioned - this ancient artifact found in South America that she couldn't wait to tell me about?</p>
<p>'I have a two-hour layover at the airport,' she had said on the telephone. 'Can you meet me for dinner? You're going to love what this manuscript says - it's just your kind of mystery.</p>
<p>My-kind of mystery? What did she mean by that?</p>
<p>Inside, the restaurant was crowded. Several couples waited for tables. When I found the hostess, she told me Charlene had already been seated and directed me toward a terraced area above; the main dining room.</p>
<p>I walked up the steps and became aware of a crowd of people surrounding one of the tables. The crowd included two policemen. Suddenly, the policemen turned and rushed past me and down the steps. As the rest of the people dispersed, I could see past them to the person who seemed to have been the center of attention - a woman, still seated at the table . . . Charlene!</p>
<p>I quickly walked up to her. 'Charlene, what's going on? Is anything wrong?'</p>
<p>She tossed her head back in mock exasperation and stood up, flashing her famous smile. I noticed that her hair was perhaps different, but her face was exactly as I remembered: small delicate features, wide mouth, huge blue eyes.</p>
<p>'You wouldn't believe it,' she said, pulling me into a friendly hug. 'I went to the rest room a few minutes ago and while I was gone, someone stole my briefcase.'</p>
<p>'What was in it?'</p>
<p>'Nothing of importance, just some books and magazines I was taking along for the trip. It's crazy. The people at the other tables told me someone just walked in, picked it up, and walked out. They gave the police a description and the officers said they would search the area.'</p>
<p>'Maybe I should help them look?'</p>
<p>'No, no. Let's forget about it. I don't have much time and I want to talk with you.'</p>
<p>I nodded and Charlene suggested we sit down. A waiter approached so we looked over the menu and gave him our order. Afterward, we spent ten or fifteen minutes chatting in general. I tried to underplay my self- imposed isolation but Charlene picked up on my vagueness. She leaned over and gave me that smile again. </p>

<p>A Diary</p>
<p>Today I ducked into a drugstore and bought a notebook - this notebook right here that I'm writing in. Clearly a momentous event.</p>
<p>I've never kept (or been tempted to keep) a diary of any kind, and I'm not even sure I'm going to keep this one, but I thought I'd better try. I find it's a peculiar business, because, though I'm supposedly only writing for myself, I feel impelled to explain who I am and what I'm doing here. It makes me suspect that all diarists are in fact writing not for themselves but for posterity.</p>
<p>I wonder if there's a child anywhere who hasn't, at some stage of awakening consciousness, incorporated into his/her address "The World" and "The Universe." Having already done that (almost three decades ago), I begin this diary by writing:</p>
<p>I am Jared Osborne, a priest, assistant pastor, parish of St. Edward's, professed of the Order of St. Lawrence, Roman Catholic Church. And having written that, I feel obliged to add: not a very good priest. (Wow, this diary business is hot stuff. These are words I've never dared to whisper, even to myself!) Without examining the logic of this too closely, I can say it's precisely because I'm "not a very good priest" that I feel the need to start this diary at this point in my life.</p>
<p>This is excellent. This is exactly where I have to begin. Before I go on to anything else, I have to put it down right here in black and white who I am and how I got here, though thank God I don't have to go back as far as my childhood or anything like that. I just have to go back far enough to figure out how I came to be involved in one of the strangest quests of modern times.</p>
<p>Recruiting Poster: Why I'm a Laurentian</p>
<p>By long tradition, we Laurentians have been defined in terms of our difference from the Jesuits. Some historians say we're not as bad, some say we're worse, and some say the only difference between us is that they have a better instinct for public relations. Both were founded at roughly the same time to combat the Reformation, and when that battle was lost (or at least over), both redefined themselves as elitist educators. And where do little Jesuits and Laurentians come from? Jesuit recruits come from Jesuit schools, and Laurentian recruits come from Laurentian schools.</p>
<p>I came to the Laurentians from St. Jerome's University, the intellectual hearth of the order in the United States. This may explain why I became a Laurentian, but of course it doesn't explain why I became a priest. All I can say on that point right now is that the reasons I gave when I was in my early twenties no longer seem very persuasive to me.</p>
<p>The important thing to note here is that I was considered a real comer when I was an undergraduate. I was expected to be another jewel in the crown - but by the time postdoctoral studies rolled around, I'd been spotted as a rhinestone - plenty of flash but pure paste. I was a big disappointment to everybody, most of all to me, of course. My superiors were as nice about it as they could be. I was never going to be invited to join the faculty at St. Jerome's or any other of the order's universities, but they did offer to find a place for me at one of their prep schools. Or if I didn't care to be humiliated quite that much, I could be loaned out to the diocese for work in the parochial trenches. I chose the latter, which is how I ended up at St. Ed's. </p>

Daniel Quinn's Ishmael was the winner of the Turner Tomorrow
Fellowship, a prize honoring fiction that produces creative and positive
solutions to global problems. This extraordinary novel has become an
underground bestseller and a testament for a burgeoning spiritual
movement. Now Quinn carries the message of Ishmael even further -in
this remarkable and compelling new novel filled with intrigue and
startling ideas.
<p>THE STORY OF B "People are listening, Jared - possibly to something quite new. That makes it dangerous."</p>
<p>So begins Father Jared Osborne's mission to Europe to find a peripatetic preacher whose radical message is attracting a growing circle of followers. Father Osborne is bound by a covert centuries old mandate held by his religious order: to know before all others that the Antichrist is among us - and to try to suppress and destroy him. Every fifty years or so, a new candidate emerges and is investigated, despite the fact that they've always proved to be harmless - until now.</p>
<p>The target of Osborne's investigation is an American known to his followers only as B. He isn't teaching meditation or goddess worship, faith healing or New Age spiritualism. He isn't out to make money or build a fanatical following. Instead he is quietly uncovering the hidden history of our planet, redefining the fall of man, and retracing a path of human spirituality that extends millions of years into the past.</p>
<p>Osborne follows B's elusive trail from a dead end in Salzburg to an existentialist cabaret in Munich to a candlelit retreat in the subcellar of a dilapidated theater, here he first encounters the mysterious B and his intriguing female colleague, Shirin. From the beginning, Osborne is stunned, outraged, and awed by the originality and power of B's teaching. Is B merely a heretic - or is he the Antichrist sent to educe humanity not with wickedness but with ideas more alluring than those of traditional religion? Pressed by his superiors for a judgment, Osborne is driven to penetrate B's inner circle. There, as B's chosen disciple, he soon finds himself an anguished collaborator in the dismantling of his own religious foundations.</p>
<p>The Story of B combines Daniel Quinn's provocative and visionary ideas with a masterfully plotted story of adventure and suspense that will keep you riveted and guessing until the last page. A special section brings together B's controversial public teachings, compelling reading for anyone interested in the future of our world - and the survival of humanity. </p>

<h2>The total librarian</h2>
<p><b>Traditionalists worry that the Internet will drown knowledge in a sea of random information. Indexing technology has proved them wrong so far</b></p><ul></ul>


<p>"YOU shall seek all day ere you find them; and, when you have them, they are not worth the search." Shakespeare understood the plight of the Internet surfer. The Internet's greatest asset--that it lets anybody "publish" worldwide, practically for nothing--is also its greatest liability. It is as if the world's greatest library were created by inviting millions of people to bring along some books, knickknacks and old snaps, and stack them on a shelf, any shelf.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the beginning the only way to find something on the Internet was to have somebody tell you where it was. Most of the people on the Internet were then academics, who are used to such informal information-sharing, so this approach was good enough. But as universities began to hook up their students, who were then joined by companies and home users, word-of-mouth was not enough. The search services that existed were incomplete, hard to use--and swamped.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The introduction of the World Wide Web in 1993, with its concept of hypertext links between documents, revolutionised the Internet, and the process of finding things on it. With the easy-to-use Web came a flood of information, as readers morphed into publishers, and the Internet's content began to look more and more like Jorge Luis Borges's fictional "Total Library" of all human knowledge.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But along with this mass of data came a way to make sense of it. Hypertext meant that each document on the Web was ultimately linked to all others in a string of associations, much as every person on the planet is said to be only six acquaintances away from every other. Because hypertext links tend to connect related documents along a particular theme, it is theoretically possible to find whatever you want simply by surfing the contours of this "information space", at each intersection taking the route most like the subject you are pursuing. In practice, this works only if you have a good idea of where to start. More often ("Is there a good Japanese restaurant in West Hollywood?") you have no idea where to begin. What you need is an index.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Internet users have assembled plenty of home-grown indexes, each focused on a specific area, but none of them comes close to covering the whole Internet. Companies are now competing to offer fuller Internet guides. Their offerings fall into three main categories: indexes, search services and hybrids.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yahoo! is the best example of the first. With a lead "ontologist" and a staff of 20 full-time classifiers, it races to sort the Web's new pages into sensible categories. Bringing order to all human knowledge is a long-standing Sisyphean folly, but Yahoo! comes remarkably close. It has some 20,000 categories, listing more than 200,000 Web sites. Users can search by keyword or can follow subject links.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yahoo! does a tremendous job, but it is fighting a losing battle. As fast as the Yahoos find sites and classify them, the Web grows faster. It already has more than 80m pages, and is doubling in size every four or five months. And each classifier adds his own private bias: is Scientology a cult or a religion? Too many classifiers and the predictability of the system erodes; too few and it becomes incomplete. Yahoo! has chosen to lean towards the second approach: rather than claiming to be the complete guide to the Web, it sees itself more as a "Best Of" service.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Search "engines" are the opposite: an "All Of" service. The leading ones--Lycos, InfoSeek and Digital Equipment Corporation's AltaVista--send software "spiders" out into the Web to follow every link on every page, returning details of each new one they find. By having such robots constantly trolling the Internet, these services end up with what amounts to a copy of the entire Web in their own computers. Visitors can then type in a few keywords and these search engines will return every Web page that includes those words.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advantage of this is that it can ignore classification. Are rumours of "black helicopters" conspiracy theory, military aviation or politics? Who cares? Find them all, and then sort it out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is amazing stuff, and more useful than just finding sites. You can find people, measure your own Web stature (a few hundred hits on your own name is worth bragging about), even use it as a sort of zeitgeist spell-checker, to see which form of a new word is most commonly used. But ultimately, it is not enough. Users who do not know exactly what they want and are not expert in "Boolean searching" (the use of commands such as <font size=-1>AND</font> or <font size=-1>NOT</font> to direct a search) are likely to find themselves scrolling through hundreds or thousands of possibly pertinent sites.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What the Web needs is something in between: a service that is both "All" and "Best". This is the dream of the hybrids, which attempt to harness the computers themselves to bring some order to the information chaos. Excite, for example, uses a statistical technique to lump together pages that have many words in common.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This and related automated classification techniques can keep up with the Web's growth. But they still suffer from the naivet&eacute; of machines. They are undiscriminating, likely to rank a press release as highly as an investigative news report, and to include everything on a subject, no matter how dim or deluded.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best hybrid, InfoSeek's "Ultra" engine ( <a href="http://ultra.infoseek.com">http://ultra.infoseek.com</a> ), knows enough about English to recognise short phrases, names and word variants ("mice" will also find "mouse"), which filters out much of the clutter. The result is a site that, when it works, makes the Internet feel like an oracle. But, if the predictions of Oren Etzioni, a computer scientist at the University of Washington, prove right, searches in the future will be better in at least three ways. Software on your own <font size=-1>PC</font> will learn your interests, which will help it pick the most relevant search services. It will also know more about the resources available, directing a search for a person to the best names database, and a search for medical information to a health database. And, eventually, the software will know more about English, allowing more "natural language" querying.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Etzioni's "SoftBot" project provides hints to what this future might look like. But the one thing that it cannot do much about is the quality of the pages it returns: it will find wrong answers as cheerfully as right ones. Which is why there will probably always be a role for both man and robot in this game.

<p>MEMBERS of the United Nations have always been sloppy about choosing their club's top officials; when good men or (very rarely) women happen to get the jobs, it tends to be by luck rather than judgment. Never before, however, has the <font size=-1>UN</font> got itself in quite such a tangle over appointing its secretary-general. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose term runs out at the end of this year, wants a second go (which has never before been denied an incumbent); the Americans for political reasons have said that they will veto his reappointment. Neither Mr Boutros-Ghali, who on the whole has done fairly well, nor the Americans are prepared to give way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A splendid time, therefore, for two distinguished <font size=-1>UN</font> veterans, Brian Urquhart and Erskine Childers (who sadly died recently), to present an up-to-date version of their advice, first proffered and ignored in 1990, on how a secretary-general and other <font size=-1>UN</font> notables should more sensibly be chosen. Is it being ignored again? In essence, yes. The current method is absurdly lackadaisical: somebody puts himself forward and the five veto-wielding members of the Security Council decide, for political reasons, whether he is acceptable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The authors' recommendations are brisk. All the <font size=-1>UN</font>'s executive heads, including the secretary-general, should have a single seven-year term. A search body would be set up to track down talent, to scrutinise prospective candidates and present a short list for further examination. And, most radically, they want the <font size=-1>UN</font> to think about the qualities its top men should have. Some incumbents have been dreadful.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These days, it seems that the only thought in American minds is that the world's top officials should be cost-cutters. Senator Jesse Helms, who leads the charge against the <font size=-1>UN</font>, suggests in the current issue of <i>Foreign Affairs </i>that America (the <font size=-1>UN</font>'s largest debtor) should leave the club unless the next secretary-general can prove that it is being "downsized".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dotty American view of Mr Boutros-Ghali--that he seeks world government--makes it electorally convenient for President Clinton to oppose him, despite the views of other governments. An obvious compromise is to allow him two more years, or seven in all, letting everyone off the hook with a term the authors of this sensible study recommended in the first place.

United Nations Leadership
1. Introduction
<p>A World in Need of Leadership: Tomorrow's United Nations was first published nearly six years ago at a time of great optimism about the United Nations. We stated then that a successful response to the new challenges being presented to the United Nations system of organizations 'will depend in considerable measure on the capacity and quality of their leadership'. We pointed out that such leadership would be needed 'to bring divergent interests together, and to generate ideas large and practical enough to match and manage new global developments'. It would also be needed for the reform and even the restructuring of the existing international system.</p>
<p>Six years later the climate for international cooperation has badly deteriorated. The post-Cold War world has proved complex and violent, and some of the UN's new commitments have proved to be quagmires or even failures. A striking absence of leadership both at the national and the international level has generated skepticism about international organizations in many quarters. Domestic financial constraints and current ideological aversion to governmental institutions have both been instrumental in reducing support for the UN system.</p>
<p>The costs of the system for all its economic and social, political and peace work are minuscule by any disinterested measurement (about $2 per year per human being alive on Earth). Nonetheless, many activities which until recently were considered vital to the peoples of the world have undergone crippling reductions. Even more serious are signs in influential quarters of an emerging neo-isolationism and a distaste for multilateral action, trends which echo similar movements in the 1920s and 1930s that had disastrous consequences for the world.</p>
<p>In the past five years there has been an increasing tendency to assign vital and complex tasks to the UN without providing the leadership, the resources or the authority to tackle them effectively, and then conveniently to blame 'the UN' for the subsequent shortcomings. At the time of writing, the UN--whatever that may mean--is blamed for the collapse of the role assigned to it by the Security Council in Bosnia, for the Council's failure to prevent or halt genocide in Rwanda, and for earlier failures in Somalia. This has led (not for the first time) to proclaiming the necessity to seek solutions elsewhere and even to prophesying the end of UN peacekeeping.</p>
<p>These 'UN failures' are also being used for larger ends. Influential politicians in the United States question the basic rationale of the UN as conceived by President Franklin Roosevelt and his successors: the necessity of collective international action both to maintain international peace and security and to build its foundation by promoting economic and social development for all. Adherents of this ideological trend also seek to garner wider support by incessant attacks on UN management and performance. In fact, the effort to force reform by cutting off funds has brought the UN to a breaking point and is making serious reform and reorganization virtually impossible.</p>
<p>Good administration, expert management, and an international civil service of the highest quality are indeed vital to the future of the world organization. The Secretary-General must be able to work effectively for very difficult objectives, and to delegate authority to carefully selected deputies in order to achieve them. However, in a world where many dangerous problems have been seriously neglected, an exclusive concentration on internal management issues can, and will, seriously distract attention and resources from other major responsibilities. The United Nations does not have sovereign authority, significant power, or resources of its own. It relies to a great degree for its effectiveness on the ideas and principles in the Charter and the decisions and guidelines adopted by the General Assembly. The Secretary-General is the key executive of these principles and guidelines, and their institutional guardian.</p>
<p>The Secretary-General, more than anyone else, will stand for the United Nations as a whole. In the eyes of the world (he) must embody the principles and ideals of the Charter to which the Organization seeks to give effect. Report of the United Nations Preparatory Commission, UN document PC/20, 23 December 1945, page 87.</p>
<p>One test of a Secretary-General is the degree to which he or she can make these ideas and principles understandable and acceptable, not just to governments but to the peoples of the world as well. A second main test concerns guardianship. In a highly disorderly world the UN can be easily abused by poor or self- serving decision-making. On such occasions the Secretary-General cannot merely be 'the servant of the Security Council', but must be prepared to speak out when UN principles or guidelines are being ignored, or when there is a failure to match assigned tasks with adequate mandates and resources. Dag Hammarskjold, who succeeded more than any other Secretary-General in articulating the aims and principles of the UN to a world public, spoke of his task as 'working on the edge of the development of human society' to promote 'the creative evolution' of human institutions. He saw the UN as a 'venture in progress towards an international community living in peace under the laws of justice'. The great venture is now in desperate need of inspiring, visionary leadership.</p>
<p>Strong and independent leadership by the Secretary-General is sometimes resented. The UN is an intergovernmental organization, and governments have 110 intention of giving up control of it. But in times of major crisis, when governments have reached the limits of their own resourcefulness, the Secretary-General can play an indispensable role in clarifying, rallying, and proposing new ways forward. Then, a clear and independent voice can make the vital difference--and this, too, is often missing. </p>

A WORLD IN NEED OF LEADERSHIP: TOMORROW'S UNITED
NATIONS
<p>A FRESH APPRAISAL</p>
<p>By Brian Urquhart and Erskine Childers</p>
<p><ul> 'The selection of the leaders of the principal international organizations, including the Secretary-General of the United Nations... continued to be haphazard, far less searching or systematic than any small university's procedures for choosing a new president'</ul></p>
<p>In this book the authors renew their frank examination of how governments choose the executive heads of the UN System. They have substantially expanded their 1990 study with more detailed analyses, and recommendations for uniform leadership policies in the UN System.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that the selection of a UN Secretary-General has not to date been a search for a superlative candidate, but 'almost literally an "old- boy network" affair'. They also analyse elections among the Specialized Agencies, pointing out that the lack of any common policy for the system by its member governments 'denies them and the international community any possibility of a UN-System team integrally planned for any future period'. Up to date statistics on all leadership posts refute 'the widespread canard that the UN System is dominated by the Third World'.</p>
<p>The study concludes with 15 detailed recommendations that do not require constitutional change. The authors urge that the General Assembly should adopt a comprehensive new approach based on positive searching for the best possible person as Secretary-General, and a single term of seven years. The five Permanent Members should relinquish their veto over candidates. All governments, and civil society and the public at large, should be able to contribute suggestions at the outset and review a short list of candidates at mid- point. 'It would be healthy for the international community if the next Secretary-General were a woman.'</p>
<p>'Only statesmanship and leadership of the highest order can guide the international community through the current period of anger and upheaval and rebuild a more peaceable and just world. This is a matter of vital importance for 211 the peoples of this earth.' </p>

<h1>History writ large</h1>
<p><b>The writing of history becomes ever more specialised. Yet bold, sweeping histories still appear. Do they work?

<p>

<p>IN 1920 H.G. Wells published his "Outline of History". It was meant to awaken people to the realisation that only a rationally ordered world-state would save humanity from destroying itself. The "Outline" sold 3m copies. Yet if an undergraduate today were to present its chapters as essays they would be tossed back with a red line through them. Hopelessly amateurish, the "Outline" breaks almost every craft rule of the history profession, or as Norman Davies would now put it, the history industry.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a polemical introduction to his own survey of European history, Mr Davies sees the industry as suffering from a crisis of over-production. Historians engaged in professional debates<i> intra muros</i> write more and more about less and less, he believes. And there are, on top of that, the enemies without: the deconstructionists who denounce the "tyranny of facts" and profess to see no difference between history-writing and story-telling. Nor is it any easier for the old-fashioned historians who still try to explain "what really happened" but who reach also for a non-professional readership. Writing for generations brought up on television, they too are tempted to present history as a succession of images. All of which, in Mr Davies's view, denies "educated adults" the general work they deserve on the origins of contemporary problems, without which they "cannot hope to function efficiently".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Davies's introduction is more than a catalogue of the pits in which professional historians have buried themselves. They are guilty men, he thinks, in that by neglect they have cut off Western Europe from the Europe to the east, excising Poland, Bohemia and Hungary from the history of the Renaissance. By their manipulation of the ambiguous concept of western civilisation to exclude the barbarian Slavs, they have accepted a frontier frozen by the cold war. With its end, Mr Davies implies, the breach can be healed and the excised nations brought into an enlarged Europe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite his polemical agenda, Mr Davies accepts in practice that, as with a camel, it is easier to describe Europe than to define it. And he describes Europe in all its diversity with immense learning and panache in a book weighing almost two kilos that sweeps from Hellas to the collapse of the Soviet empire. There are doses of shock treatment. Thirty years before Auschwitz, D.H. Lawrence suggested the building of a "lethal chamber as big as the Crystal Palace" for the disposal of "the sick, the halt and the maimed". This was not racism but eugenic cleansing. It was H.G. Wells who speculated on how his New Republic would "treat the inferior races".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Davies has to confront the problem of every historian who sets out to write "total history" over a long space of time. The difficulty is to combine the hawk's vision from above with the view at ground level. His solution is "capsules", some 300 mini-essays framed in distinctive type. A capsule on German nationalism, as celebrated by the colossal Hermann monument (1875), leaps backward to a monument to Prince Llewelyn's dog (1790) as "the ultimate in political aesthetics of national sentiment". Although the capsules are helpful in removing, say, the technical achievements of musicians from the narrative text, they sometimes bear so little relationship to the text that they are self-indulgent, even quirky. A capsule on corn dollies serves to explain the importance of wheat as a European crop; but a capsule on the last words of the famous, from Nero's mother to H.G. Wells, distracts rather than illuminates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Davies's other device is the "snapshot" which freezes in time a moment of symbolic importance. These are small masterpieces in which history comes to life as individuals wrestle with insoluble problems on imperfect information, often to be overwhelmed by accident. A vivid description of the siege of Syracuse (212 <font size=-1>BC</font>) illustrates the balance of power in the Mediterranean. A day-by-day account of how Europe blundered into war in 1914 contains superb portraits of the British foreign secretary, Edward Grey, the country gentleman who warmed to Theodore Roosevelt when he recognised the song of the "gold crested wren"; and of his German opposite number, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, a polite and earnest bureaucrat.</p>
<p><b>Self-confidence and its loss</b>
<br>John Roberts's approach to the problems of writing a "total" history of Europe is different, and more convincing. His gifts of compression and clear exposition are outstanding. Within a narrative framework he ranges from the role of cattle in Minoan society to the influence of Freud as questioning "the very foundations of liberal civilisation". His cardinal virtue is his constant awareness that events in the past were once in the future. Luther could not foresee that the Latin theses he nailed to a door in 1517 would finally destroy the unity of Christendom. Nobody in 1914 foresaw the horrors of a war that would undermine the self-confidence of Europe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Mr Roberts, Europe is an imperfectly defined geographical area in which various peoples have shared certain experiences at certain times, but this casts no light on "any on-going persistent civilisation we can identify as Europe". His key point is that by the 19th century these people had achieved a commercial, political and cultural hegemony in the world based on a shared conviction of racial, Christian or technical superiority.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Traditional societies might attempt to resist the dissolvent impact of a superior civilisation without success, as in the Indian Mutiny and the Boxer Rebellion in China. But the solvent of Europe's overseas empires was to be its most successful cultural export: nationalism turned a conservative reaction into a revolutionary anti-Europe anti-imperialist creed, first in India and then throughout Asia. One Asian nation "modernised" on European lines so as to resist European influence: in 1905, Japan inflicted on Russia the first defeat of a major European power by Asians since the Middle Ages. Its victory was an inspiration to other Asians, "the greatest single reason for them to ponder whether European rule was bound to be their lot".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By 1914 Europe's hegemony was showing signs of strain. Its collapse came as a disunited Europe of competing nations committed collective suicide in what Mr Roberts calls Europe's two civil wars. By 1945, the old imperial powers--the Dutch, French and British--were bankrupt and dependent on America in a world split between two superpowers. Mr Roberts argues that had Russia been among the victors of 1919 at Versailles, it might have achieved the supremacy given it, not by the attractions of Soviet communism but by the might of the Soviet armies, in 1945.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a global economy, in which decisions in Tokyo affected unemployment in Wales, Europe could no longer be considered as an autonomous unit with a distinct history. "Europe's work", in Mr Roberts's view, "is done": its innovations and ideologies have been internalised by non-European societies and turned against it. Its world historical role has been eroded. Hitler's declaration of war against America changed the destiny of the world. No modern European statesman could take a decision of such magnitude. Any claim to be the residuary legatee of Christendom, created in the Middle Ages by the advances of the alternative civilisation of Islam, makes no sense, he believes, in a Europe that is now a "neo-pagan and post-Christian society".</p>
<p><b>Examining the clockwork</b>
<br>Hugh Thomas's solution to writing total history is more radical. He jettisons narrative history for thematic history. A brilliant writer, if sometimes perverse in his judgments, his <i>Leitmotiv</i> is the influence on societies of technology, conceived in the widest sense. The cultivation of new crops provides the key to the ancient, settled empires. He notes the "rice driven" hydraulic Empire of China. The stirrup brings the "horse-powered autocracy" of William the Conqueror. The Reformation could not have succeeded without the "real revolution" of moveable type: Protestantism is a book religion; Luther was a bestseller.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the Industrial Revolution and its consequences he positively delights in detail: barbed wire, invented to keep cattle from straying, contributed to the horrors of trench warfare. In the end, the result of technological and scientific advance is paradoxical. Not only has the optimism of the 19th century, inspired by its material successes, been eroded. In the 1930s people thought they understood the scientific triumphs that shaped our world. Today they are less sure.</p>
<p><b>The pitfalls of grand history</b></b>
<br>Like Mr Roberts, Lord Thomas argues that good history is necessary because bad history brings disaster on those who peddle it and seek to impose their distorted visions on whole societies. Hitler, for whom all history was the history of race, might have won the war had he not expelled Jewish scientists. More convincingly it was his misreading of Russian history and of the need of Germany for <i>Lebensraum</i> to the east that led him to Stalingrad and defeat. Communist tyrannies professed to believe that the class struggle was the motor of history, when according to Lord Thomas, "it is utterly false to suppose that all history is the history of class struggle". Like their mentor Marx, they were, in his view, blind to the force of nationalism, suppressing what they did not understand.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But history, to Lord Thomas, is not without lessons. History properly understood puts people on guard against "the growth and grossness of the modern state". Like his admired de Tocqueville, he sees centralising regimes crushing those intermediate bodies that sustain liberty and give colour to our lives. The success of America is, he thinks, a result of an optimistic view of the capacities of human beings; most things are better done by individuals than by the overgrown state.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How secure are such conclusions? Wells drew a different message: we can be saved only by a Platonic world republic. World history from the Stone Age to the Gulf war is fascinating in its own right as a record of the sufferings and triumphs of mankind. But given the immense diversity of human experience over time, attempts to discover a pattern yields "laws" of dubious validity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oswald Spengler, in "The Decline of the West" (1918), the most ambitious, misleading and, in its time, most influential essay in world history (Arnold Toynbee and Hitler were among his victims), drew the conclusion that civilisations and empires must, like living organisms, suffer a process of decline and decay. True enough, empires and civilisations do collapse. But so general a proposition tells you little. They decline for a complex variety of reasons. They can collapse suddenly as did the European empires after 1945; they can soldier on for centuries as did Byzantium. "Imperial overstretch" may be a convincing explanation of Spain's decline, but it is less convincing when employed to portend the imminent collapse of America's hegemony.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so final and seemingly decisive an event as the "implosion" of the Soviet empire is open to widely different interpretation. To Lord Thomas, it leaves the world with a single superpower capable of global management provided it does not suffer from spasms of self-doubt and a lack of restraint in intervening to suppress "brutal wrongdoing". He suggests that it offers "the prospect of a better world than any other which can reasonably be imagined" even if that world is compelled to copy "its style of government, its music, its fashion, even its food". For Mr Davies, the mindless materialism of a transatlantic, homogenised culture may be the most insidious consequence of America's triumph. Both views are sweeping but can both be right?

PENINSULA
<p>Environment and Prehistory</p>
<p>THERE is a marked determinism about many descriptions of Europe's environmental history. Many Europeans have assumed that their 'continent' was so magnificently endowed that it was destined by Nature for world supremacy. And many have imagined that Europe's good fortune would somehow last forever. 'The empire of climate', wrote Montesquieu in 1748, 'is the first of all empires'; and he proceeded to show that the European climate had no rival. For Montesquieu, as for his many successors, Europe was synonymous with Progress.</p>
<p>There has also been a good deal of national parochialism. Even the founder of human geography, the great Paul Vidal de la Blache (1845-1918), one of the intellectual ancestors of the Annales school, was not above a touch of Gallic chauvinizing. The geography of France, he stressed, was marked by the keynote of variety. 'Against the diversities which assail her', he wrote, 'France sets her force d'assimilation, her power of assimilation. She transforms everything that she receives ' On Britain, in contrast, he quotes the doggerel lines about 'this paltry little isle, I with acres few and weather vile'. One hundred years later one finds Fernand Braudel doing similar things. Variety is indeed a characteristic of France's superb make-up. But it is not a French monopoly; it is a hallmark of Europe as a whole.</p>
<p>In fact, the Peninsula of Europe is not really a 'continent' at all: it is not a self-contained land mass. At c.10 million km2 (3.6 million square miles), it is less than one-quarter the size of Asia, one-third of Africa, one-half of each of the Americas. Modern geographers classify it, like India, as a subcontinent of Eurasia: 'a cape of the old continent, a western appendix of Asia'. Even so, it is impossible to deny that Europe has been endowed with a formidable repertoire of physical features. Europe's landforms, climate, geology, and fauna have combined to produce a benign environment that is essential to an understanding of its development. </p>

CHAPTER ONE	Bedrock
<p>Geography</p>
<p>Our maps lead us to take certain geographical facts for granted, even if some have not been there very long. Among them is a set of shapes. We can begin to look for Europe when the sub-continent at the western end of the Eurasian landmass had acquired more or less the physical shape it has today, about ten thousand years ago. Then, much was already in place which was going to settle a lot of later history and shape millions of lives for thousands of years. The much more remote past of prehistory had left behind a big promontory or peninsula jutting out to the west from Asia, rather as India juts out from it to the south. Except in the east, even its most inland areas were and are not very far from the sea. There are some biggish offshore islands to the north and west (the British Isles) and to the south (Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete); around them and along the mainland's coasts are dotted hundreds of others which are much smaller. Along those coasts also lie subsidiary, but still large, peninsulas of which the most important are those of Scandinavia, Brittany, Iberia, Italy and Greece. Almost everywhere, too, the shoreline is indented with a multitude of inlets, gulfs and bays, some of them fed by rivers winding hundreds of miles inland.</p>
<p>Geography is very important, but it has been remarked that history is made by the men who control and discover geographical facts. The sea was to be one of the major determinants of a changing Europe and of the lives of those who lived there. The first of them could never have dreamed how important the opportunities offered by access to salt water were to be to those who came after them, thousands of years later. To the south they faced two big and almost enclosed tracts of water, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean in the north; the Baltic is another huge lake. The Atlantic and the North Sea, on the other hand, open on the world. When humans finally learnt how to manage long-distance travel at sea, Europeans would find themselves very favourably placed at the edge of major wind systems and currents which offered good opportunities for getting about the world. Another important oceanic fact was the Gulf Stream, whose special climatic importance lay in the warmth it brought to north- western Europe. But the most usual determinant of temperature is latitude-- position in relation to the sun--and Europe's latitude, together with plentiful Atlantic rain, meant that most of it has been well-watered and has enjoyed mild weather without major upheaval or change since the retreat of the ice-fields from southem Scandinavia in about 7000 BC.</p>
<p>The northern limit to this moderate climatic zone runs across Scandinavia, whose northem half tails off into a terrain and flora shared with much of the north of what we now call Russia, and distinguished by tundra, forest and, finally, Arctic ice and snow. But most of the rest of Russia, like much of central and eastern Europe, enjoys what is called a 'continental' climate and here, for the first time, we face one of those major, sometimes defining, facts differentiating westem and eastern Europe. In Russia, summer and winter temperatures can run to extremes. The other distinctive climatic zone which has had a conditioning influence on Europe's destinies lies to the south. All round the coasts of the Mediterranean basin today's climate is probably less uniform than was once the case. Southern Europe's shores were once much greener than they are today, and so, even more strikingly if we could see them, were those of North Africa, the Levant and the Near East. The biblical cedars of Lebanon came from a country more densely wooded than the modern traveller sees, and North Africa was once a great corn growing region. Well into historical times, though, the Mediterranean coasts, north and south, were better-watered and more fertile than today. Dessication has gone far to strip the shores of North Africa and the Levant, and the deserts behind them are now much nearer the sea than in ancient times. To the north, the inland margins of what we might call Mediterranean Europe are not so conveniently defined as its shorelines, but one long-significant marker is the northern limit of olive cultivation. 'The first olive tree on the way south marks the beginning of the Mediterranean region' remarks one scholar. Drawn by climate and contour (in Italy it runs along both sides of the central mountain spine, not far from the sea), it has hardly moved in two thousand years. Europe's first cities all appeared south of it.</p>
<p>Contours and topography have been more stable than climate. The English Channel came and went more than once in prehistoric times, but last appeared again about eight thousand years ago (though only in about 4000 BC did the seas reach their present level). Since then, of course, local topography has often been deliberately changed by humans as more effective technologies became available, and precise coastlines have fluctuated a lot in some places. In particular, the draining of marshlands was to make possible even in early times the establishment of settlements, and therefore a human impact on landscape, near the mouths of rivers. Yet the basic physical structure of the continent has altered hardly at all since precivilized times. </p>

The Birth of the World
<p><ul> Geschrieben steht: 'Im Anfang war das Wort!' Hier stock ich schon . . . (It is written: 'In the beginning was the word!' Here I am stuck already . . . ) GOETHE, FAUST PART 3</ul></p>
<p>Genealogy has its satisfactions, but how disconcerting to those who worship ancestors to find that, in the direct male line, men derive from, in ascending order, a monkey, a newt, a sea-lily and a bacterium. The legend that the Earl of Northumbria in Shakespeare's Macbeth was descended from a fairy bear seems, once the principles of evolution are accepted, only mildly misleading.</p>
<p>Life, however, is the first ingredient to take into account. The solar system of which the Earth is part is now known to be a galaxy of 100 billion stars in an archipelago of galaxies comparable to ours, adrift in space. The Universe apparently began 15,000 or 20,000 million years ago as a result of an explosion which propelled all the galaxies away from each other. The nearest galaxy to our own is two million light years away. Our galaxy and the Earth came into being almost simultaneously following the contraction, by rotation, of clouds of dust, between 4000 and 5000 million BC. The Sun was a concentrated core at the centre of this rotation. The planets formed around pieces of debris.</p>
<p>No one suspected until recently that the Earth and the Universe were so old as this. In the seventeenth century, James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, spoke of the world as being created in 4004 BC. The Brench naturalist Georges Buffon, in the eighteenth century, thought that the world might be 'at least 70,000 years old'. In 1755 the Philosopher Kant speculated that it might be 'a million, or even millions of, years old'. But the timetable now regarded as correct was discovered in 1935 by an inspired astronomer, Edwin Hubble, of Missouri. The considered study of the skies, however, began long ago in Babylon where much data were gathered and analysed, by relatively advanced mathematics.</p>
<p>The Earth's crust wrinkled for a long time, creating mountains. Seas were caused by the further condensation of vapours. The sea and the land were once absolutely divided in a planet which thus had one ocean and one continent, but the latter, known to geologists as Pangaea, split into the present continents about 2000 million BC, leaving two-thirds of the globe now covered by water. Much movement of land, however, continued afterwards. The creation of the Channel, which divides England from Europe, and the Bering Straits, which cut off Asia from America, was the product of later commotions. India was separated by sea from northern Asia for a time before 45 million BC, as was, till about 2 million BC, North from South America. Africa was once as close to South America as is North America. The Mediterranean became a desert about 6 million BC and a stretch of water a million years later, while the Black Sea was once the arm of a great ocean, which included the modern Caspian and Aral seas. </p>

<h2>E<font size=-1>UROPE</font>:<br> A H<font size=-1>ISTORY</font>.<br></h2>
<p> By Norman Davies. <br>

<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
From the Ice Age to the Cold War, from Reykjavik to the Volga, from Minos to Margaret Thatcher,
Norman Davies here tells the entire history of Europe in one single volume.
<p>The narrative zooms in from the distant focus of Chapter One, which explores the first five million years of the continent's development, to the close focus of the last two chapters, which cover the twentieth century at roughly one page per year.</p>
<p>In between, Norman Davies presents a vast canvas packed with startling detail and thoughtful analysis. Alongside Europe's better-known stories--human, national and international--he examines subjects often spurned or neglected--Europe's stateless nations, for example, as well as the nation-states and great powers, and the minority groups from heretics and lepers to Romanies, Jews, and Muslims. He reveals not only the rich diversity of Europe's past but also the numerous prisms through which it can be viewed.</p>
<p>Each chapter contains a selection of telephoto 'capsules' illustrating specific issues that cut across the chronological flow. Each chapter concludes with a wide-angle 'snapshot' of the whole continent captured at one symbolic moment. The overall effect is stunning--a kind of historical picture album, with panoramic tableaux interspersed with detailed inserts and close-ups.</p>
<p>In its range and ambition, its original structure and glittering style, Norman Davies's Europe represents one of the most important and illuminating history books ever to be published by Oxford.</p>
<p>'I set myself the impossible task of constructing a total history of all Europe in every period', writes Norman Davies.</p>
<p>'The main aim was to map out the basic grid of time and space, and then, by filling the framework with a comprehensive range of topics, to convey an impression of the unattainable whole. The technique may be likened to that of a pointilliste painter '.</p>
<p>'At other thlles'. he reflects 'l seem to have used my words to build a combination of picture-gallery and echo-chamber, where all the mingled images, sounds and emotions of Europe's past interact and reverberate. Conventional historical methods must be employed to forge the constituent parts But the overall structure can only be designed by one's historical imagination.' </p>

<h2>A H<font size=-1>ISTORY OF</font> E<font size=-1>UROPE</font>.<br></h2>

<p><b>Jacket Copy</p></b>
The history of the world has been influenced in a profound way by the history
of Europe. The development and universal spread of 'western values' has
brought prosperity, as well as destruction, to all it touches. How is it that the
small continent of Europe, with its rich multiplicity of cultures and traditions,
has had this farreaching effect? Writing in his appealing story-telling style, J M
Roberts untangles the themes and values which still propel us today. Antiquity,
the age of Christendom, the Middle Ages, early modern history and the old
European order are exammed in turn. The turbulent twentieth century is given
proportionally a more detailed treatment.
<p>Narrative history from a master of the genre, A History of Europe brings into focus not only what Europeans have done, but what they have thought of themselves. Although knowing the past does not confer an ability to predict the future (no apocalyptic predictions for the millennium are made), the reader of J M Roberts' A History of Europe will nonetheless be equipped with both a broad and a deep understanding of the European peoples' history. </p>

<h2>W<font size=-1>ORLD</font> H<font size=-1>ISTORY</font>.<br></h2>

Those early years of the Earth belong to chemists, not to historians. For a historian, it is
enough to know that a metallic core, 3,750 miles wide, came into being within the Earth--
mostly liquid iron and nickel, though solid in the centre. Between that core and the Earth's
crust, a 'mantle' of iron and magnesium 1,875 miles deep took shape. The crust, of diverse
composition, varies between twelve to thirty miles in depth on land, and only four miles
under the sea.
<p>One of the foremost historians of our time surveys the story of mankind. Beginning with prehistory, when the age of hunters slowly turned into an era when agriculture dominated change, through the intellectual transformations of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, to the industrial era and the modern world, Hugh Thomas stresses themes of particular interest and significance in human history and details the influence of advances in technology.</p>
<p>Within certain obvious chronological divisions this world history is organized thematically into six major sections: The Foundations of History, The Age of Agriculture, The World Transformed (after the Renaissance), Industrial Triumphs, Absolutism and Democracy, and Wars of Our Time. Subjects covered include climate, food and drink, dress, housing, population, energy, disease and medicine, religion and laws, invention, wars, agricultural and industrial development, class and race, cities and communications. Brilliantly written, original in concept and execution, this is a classic work of history by a major historian.</p>
<p>Originally published in 1980 under the title History of the World and unavailable for some years, this revised edition includes additions, deletions and corrections made since the original publication and changes in the final chapters. There is also a new epilogue and new maps. </p>

In Latin America, <i>Veja</i>, <ro>a widely read Brazilian magazine, publishes a weekly list. In Mexico, nobody puts out a similarly respected list, so our correspondent in Mexico city constructed a listing based on inquiries at two of the capital's leading bookshops. The two Mexican lists are offered here with a consumer warning to all that they should be taken as broad indicators of reading trends, not strict or conventional bestseller rankings.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One striking difference between these lists and those in Europe, say, or North America is how much more mixed they are. On the fiction lists, literary novels--for instance, Carlos Fuentes's new novel--jostle with potboilers. On the non-fiction side, books touting self-help or odd beliefs sit next to serious works of analysis or reportage on Mexico's current economic and political ills. Old is there as well as new. ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull'' is not stuffed in an ornithological museum: it has gone to Mexico. There are lots of translations but also plenty of home-written entries. ''Mal de Amores'' is a passionate historical novel by one of Mexico's most popular woman novelists. And in Mexico, Christian self-help, interestingly, takes fictional form (note the three books by Carlos Cuauhtemoc Sanchez).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Brazil, ''global authors'' also compete with local ones. There is the standard international fare of Ken Follet, Sidney Sheldon and Jostein Gaarder. But Brazilians are also reading books that throw oblique light on their own country. ''O Xango de Baker Street'' by Jo Soares transplants Sherlock Holmes to fin-de-si&egrave;cle Rio de Janeiro in a comic detective tale. ''Comedia da Vida Privada'' is a collection of gobbets of ironic reflection served up each Sunday in a Sao Paulo newspaper by Luis Fernando Verissimo. ''Rapina'' is by a first-time thriller writer and set in Brazil's financial markets. The non-fiction list is dominated by how-to and self-help books, by works involving mysticism and by Christian literature, particularly of the evangelical kind. ''Paula" is a chronicle of the last days of a bestselling Chilean author's daughter, who died of a crippling disease.<br><h3>Fiction bestsellers<a href="#foot">*</a></h3><ul><li><a href="#1">Mexico fiction</a><li><a href="#2">Mexico non-fiction</a><li><a href="#3">Brazil fiction</a><li><a href="#4">Brazil non-fiction</a></ul></td></tr></table><a name="1"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4>Mexico fiction</h4><ol><li>	La Frontera de Cristal 	<i> by Carlos Fuentes	</i>. &#160; 	The latest from one of Mexico's best-known novelists	</li><li>	Mal de Amores 	<i> by Angeles Mastreta	</i>. &#160; 	A personal and passionate historical novel	</li><li>	Volar Sobre el Pantano	<i> by Carlos Cuauhtemoc Sanchez	</i>. &#160; 	Self-help novel for people in hardship	</li><li>	El Mundo de Sofia	<i> by Jostein Gaarder	</i>. &#160; 	Teenager discovers western philosophy	</li><li>	Cartero de Neruda	<i> by Antonio Skarmeta	</i>. &#160; 	Inspiration for the film "Il Postino"	</li><li>	Juan Salvador Gaviota 	<i> by Richard Bach	</i>. &#160; 	A seagull discovers the world	</li><li>	Toy Story	<i> by Cathy East Dubowsky 	</i>. &#160; 	Novel adapted from movie script	</li><li>	Juventud en Extasis	<i> by Carlos Cuauhtemoc Sanchez	</i>. &#160; 	Christian sexual values fictionalised for teenagers	</li><li>	Un Grito Desesperado	<i> by Carlos Cuauhtemoc Sanchez	</i>. &#160; 	How to deal with family conflicts, fictionalised	</li><li>	Guia para la Vida  	<i> by Matt Groening	</i>. &#160; 	Bart Simpson's version of self-help	</li></ol></td></tr></table><a name="2"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4>Mexico non-fiction</h3><ol><li>	Los Hombres Son de Marte; Las Mujeres Son de Venus	<i> by John Gray	</i>. &#160; 	Relationships	</li><li>	Armando Hoyos	<i> by Eugenio Derbez	</i>. &#160; 	Jokes from popular TV comedian	</li><li>	Manual de la Gente Bien	<i> by Guadalupe Loaeza	</i>. &#160; 	Doings of "Beautiful people"	</li><li>	Siete Habitos de la Gente Altamenta Efectiva	<i> by Stephen Covey	</i>. &#160; 	Management guru's guide to being effective	</li><li>	Mexico en la Frontera del Caos	<i> by Andres Oppenheimer	</i>. &#160; 	Mexico's political and economic crises	</li><li>	Minutos de Sabiduria	<i>  by Torres Pastorino	</i>. &#160; 	Daily Christian meditations	</li><li>	Tu Puedes Sanar Tu Vida	<i> by Louise L.

<p><b>Political advertising on CD-ROM</b></p>
<h2>A blood sport</h2><ul> <li>T<font size=-1>HE</font> A<font size=-1>RT</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> C<font size=-1>AMPAIGN</font> A<font size=-1>DVERTISING</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By G.R. Boynton.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Chatham House;</i> <i>$19.95 and &#163;12.99</i><i> </i> <br>
</ul>


A PEERAGE was recently awarded by John Major to Maurice Saatchi, the British advertising man responsible for the slogan "Labour Isn't Working" and a series of other low-blow campaign posters for the Conservative Party. Mr Saatchi's first salvo for the Tories' advertising offensive this summer proved even more controversial. His posters seemed inspired by a Monty Python collage. They showed Tony Blair, the Labour leader, with demonic bloodshot eyes, and so offended the Advertising Standards Authority that it told the Conservative Party to stop using them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet they are tame compared with some of the more egregious examples from past American presidential campaigns which appear on G.R. Boynton's <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>. A television advertisement in support of President Lyndon Johnson's bid for re-election in 1964 is an infamous example. As a little girl in a meadow counts aloud the petals on a flower, she is gradually drowned out by a harsh male voice counting down from ten to zero. The climax is a nuclear explosion, the implied likely consequence of the defeat of Mr Johnson by the Republican Party's candidate, Barry Goldwater. More recently, Ann Richards depicted her rival in an election for governor of Texas as a little cartoon catapult that perpetually whirled mud at Ms Richards.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Boynton's <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> devotes one of its six chapters to negative advertising, illustrating with these and other video clips some of the techniques available to the would-be political bull-terrier: horror-movie sound effects, mocking caricatures, ponderous lists of the opponent's deficiencies compared with the candidate's glowing merits. Other chapters cover the use of biography by candidates, the chair as a symbol of power, and treatment of domestic and of foreign policy. But none is long enough to give more than an overview of these subjects and the disc does not tell you where to go for further information.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is a pity, because playing through "The Art of Campaign Advertising" is unlikely to satisfy anybody. Those well-versed in politics will find nothing they did not already know; people who are intrigued by something they see will soon be frustrated by the disc's deficiencies of design as well as its lack of bibliography. It contains little that could not be done better on a video tape, which would have the advantage of better-quality reproduction on television.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other than allowing the viewer to choose which of the six sections to watch, the disc is not interactive at all; each section plays through in order, without scope for interrogating images or text. Even hurrying forward to look for a particular film clip is more laborious than it would be on tape. There are unnecessary repetitions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Boynton has chosen some absorbing film clips, including several that had more influence on subsequent advertising techniques than on the political campaigns themselves. But fascination soon gives way to tedium as you watch them halt along on a computer screen, while his narrating voice blips and falters. This is a shame; the subject promised more.

</ul>



<p>TAKING a walk through an interactive "Guide to World Business and Economics" does not sound as enjoyable as a walk in the country but this McGraw-Hill <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> tries to make it as easy and enjoyable as possible. You can walk across the world (if you are in any doubt as to where you are you can cheat, as the mouse scuttles from Kirgizstan to Kazakhstan, and look at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen where the country names magically appear). A similar technique is used for charts--when you put the cursor on a bar on a chart, the actual value is shown, this time in the bottom right-hand corner.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Interactive features offer you the chance of creating your own portfolio of countries and/or subjects, although the task is complicated by the rather mysterious icons. Gathering statistics for over 226 countries on a wide variety of subjects on a reasonably comparable basis is, of course, hard to do--as <i>The Economist'</i>s own research department can attest. However bang-up-to-the-minute the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> is when it comes out, it is bound quickly to get out of date--not least because last month's <font size=-1>GDP</font>, trade inflation and sales figures are routinely revised later.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The "World of Information" sections for 1994 and 1995 are, by definition, less time-sensitive, and so more durable, than more recent facts and figures. And they reinforce the impression that this <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> serves better as a reasonably current electronic encyclopedia/almanac than as a tool for assessing business opportunities or making strategic investment decisions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The price tag makes the guide an affordable purchase for home use, which is more than can be said for the updated version that is promised for December. On current plans it will cost &#163;229.13.

<p><b>Medical ethics on CD-ROM</b></p>
<h2>Facts of death</h2><ul> <li><a href="8ex222.html">A R<font size=-1>IGHT</font> <font size=-1>TO</font> D<font size=-1>IE?</font> T<font size=-1>HE</font> D<font size=-1>AX</font> C<font size=-1>OWART</font> C<font size=-1>ASE</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Robert Cavalier, Preston Covey and David Anderson. <br>
</ul>


<p>A YOUNG man is charred over two-thirds of his body in a freak accident when a leaking natural-gas pipeline engulfs him in fire. After a year of treatment, including excruciating daily baths to keep his wounds from infection, he is blind, cannot use his hands and is horribly scarred. He asks his physicians to stop treatment. If they do so, he will die. Should the doctors agree to his wishes?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difficult real-life case of Dax Cowart is the topic of this <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>. The viewer reads the facts of the case; video clips show a disfigured Dax as well as his mother, lawyer, nurse and doctors discussing the issue. Texans all, they speak in a slow-paced twang well suited to the seriousness of the topic; they seem like decent, thoughtful people anxious to do what is right.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Suicide is "not a reasonable solution to the problem" of Mr Cowart's pain during treatment, his burn physician argues. Mr Cowart wonders why a doctor should have decision-making authority over a competent patient. "I don't see how anyone else could possibly have the right," he complains. His mother insists she could never willingly give up her son.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At different points in the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> journey, the viewer is asked questions about what should and should not be allowed to happen to Dax and why. Every once in a while, there is a chance to comment on participants' remarks or to make a decision on the case and defend it. The hope is that this semi-Socratic method could be a useful tool for schooling medical professionals in these awful dilemmas. As a whole, it succeeds, but as with so many <font size=-1>CD-ROMS</font>, the publishers have not fully tapped the technology's potential.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unless one is dogmatically libertarian (patients have all the rights) or dogmatically pro-treatment (any and all medical treatment must always be offered), it is hardly possible to negotiate the grey areas of end-of-life issues with consistency. Compassion, intellect and religious belief seldom converge. A better <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> would have let the viewer confront this moral truth by questioning the consistency of their responses. Related cases might have been given more mention. The evolving ethics of near-death decisions are part of a robust debate that does not get as much emphasis as it should. A bibliography would have helped.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And Dax Cowart? Treatment continued against his wishes, though techniques were developed that lessened his pain. He went home. Two suicide attempts failed. He is blind and cannot really use his hands (but he presses calculator buttons, for example, with his tongue). He bought a house and went to law school. He walks with ease, has married (twice) and practices--what else?--personal injury law. Mr Cowart, his face an immobile, scarred mask of flesh, says he is glad to be alive. But he thinks the decision on whether or not to end his life ought to have been his.

<p><b>Musical lives</b></p>
<h2>Wild, heroic ride</h2><ul> <li>C<font size=-1>HARLES </font>I<font size=-1>VES</a>: </font>A L<font size=-1>IFE WITH </font>M<font size=-1>USIC</font>.&nbsp;  By Jan Swafford.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Norton; 450 pages; $30 and &#163;22.50</i> <br>
</ul>

<p>WRITING music is an introverted, solitary business, and a composer's life can be outwardly uneventful, which is why many composers' biographies are so dull. Music is harder to refer to than a picture or a poem; it is also more discrete from life. You may experience a satisfying spine-tingle when Isolde begins her "Liebestod", but care little about what Wagner had for breakfast, and do your best to forget about his ghastly opinions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever the reasons, writing a composer's biography is a tough number, and it is a rare treat when a biographer gets inside a composer's skin. Jan Swafford does so magnificently in this new Ives biography. He also illuminates Ives's background, and the period which produced him.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ives was born in Danbury, Connecticut, in 1874. In 1898 he graduated from Yale (not very brilliantly, except on the football field), moved to New York and embarked on a Wall Street career in life insurance. "If [a man] has a nice wife and...children," he wrote later, "how can he let [them] starve on his dissonances?" He was a multi-millionaire before he was 40; but the strain took its toll. By 1917 he was almost written out; by 1926 he was a sick man and had stopped composing altogether. At the end of 1929 he retired from business. The rest of his life (and much of his money) was spent working to get his music heard.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is an extraordinary story, and Mr Swafford tells it brilliantly. Ives was born in the aftermath of the Civil War, when America, still rural, was healing its self-inflicted wounds with the twin medicines of God and Mammon. He came of age in turn-of-the-century New York, where optimism and boom were the order of the day: America was becoming a world power, science promised a glittering future in the new, improved 20th century and 1% of the country's population owned seven-eighths of the nation's wealth. His later years witnessed a sadder, wiser New Deal America, chastened by the first world war and the Depression.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ives was a progressive in politics, an optimist by temperament. He believed in man's perfectibility, and saw music as a means for achieving it--by happy accident, the woman he spent his life with was called Harmony. He was a New England transcendentalist, a musical successor to Emerson and Thoreau--both of whom he celebrated in his music.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He was also the man on whose shoulders fell the task of inventing American music and dragging it into the 20th century. When he was born, Brahms and Wagner were in business, and music meant European music. Dvorak shocked Americans in the 1890s by suggesting that they build a national music on the foundations of black and indigenous American music. The response of one composer, Edward Macdowell, was typical: "Masquerading in the so-called nationalism of negro clothes cut in Bohemia will not help us."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oddly enough, Ives would have agreed with this: he had no time for nationalism, seeing it as the root of all war. He despised the genteel musical culture of 19th-century America as "cissy" and exclusive. To him, music was a tree whose branches reached for the universal, but which needed roots in the particular. Ives's particular was not America, but Danbury, marching-bands and revivalist hymns. These were inclusive, democratic contexts which served him as musical icons. Once he settled in New York, his memories acquired a patina of nostalgia, and the Danbury he celebrated in his music was a place which no longer existed--and probably never had, outside his imagination. In this, as in many things, Ives foreshadows a rootless age.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More than any other composer except Mozart, he was primed for creative mastery by his father. George Ives, town bandmaster and eccentric, was a radical thinker--witness this advice (in 1894) to Charles, who was having trouble with his Yale supervisor, a genteel, German-trained composer, Horatio Parker: "Tell Parker that every dissonance doesn't have to resolve, if it doesn't happen to feel like it, any more than every horse should have to have its tail bobbed just because it's the prevailing fashion." And this: "Don't pay too much attention to the sounds...If you do, you may miss the music. You won't get a wild, heroic ride to heaven on pretty little sounds."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He was, also, a heroic figure. For years openly ridiculed by the musical establishment as a bumbling amateur (worse still, a <i>rich</i> amateur) Ives continued to compose and push his work regardless. Nor was he in the least an amateur: as Swafford shows, he had a thorough grounding, was a capable church organist, and remained an excellent pianist throughout his life.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of Ives's music does suffer from the isolation which he suffered--and which, to an extent, he inflicted on himself by his orneriness. But at its best--in "The Unanswered Question", "Central Park in the Dark", the "Concord Sonata", "Three Places in New England", the Fourth Symphony, and many of the songs--it blazes with originality and intensity. It is an astonishing legacy, which should be even more widely honoured than it is today.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite eventual recognition, Ives's last years make sad reading. The periods of overwork, neglect and disappointment had exhausted and embittered him. His manic New England optimism, which had carried him through so much, and which infuses all his music, had an inevitable depressive downside. His constitution gave way and he became a cranky recluse.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a splendid book, finely researched and couched in lucid, jargon-free language. Jan Swafford has produced a rich portrait of a great, lovable man who still has many lessons to teach. This is much more than a narrowly musical biography: it should be on the shelves of anyone interested in the history of the past century.

<h2>Pushmepullyou</h2>


<h2>For all the Web's multimedia riches, surfing is still a lot more trouble than simply turning on the TV. Something between the two is in prospect</h2><ul></ul>

<p>ASK a geek to explain the difference between the World Wide Web and the rest of the Internet, and the chances are he will mumble something about the Web being the whizzy multimedia part, with pictures and sound. True, as far as it goes. But there is another, more important, distinction, one that even the digerati are just now starting to appreciate. The Internet really encompasses two very different media: things like e-mail that simply show up on your desk every day unbidden, and the Web, which you must consciously make an effort to view.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From the perspective of the media industry, these two look as different as the cinema and television. The first requires lots of advertising and promotion, including "trailers", to draw viewers; the second can count on channel surfers to tune in to sample its programmes. The distinction can be thought of as one between "push" and "pull" media. Broadcasters "push" television at viewers, so it shows up on their screen without any effort on their part; film studios must "pull" viewers into cinemas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Web is "pull" taken to the extreme. It is as if there were thousands of films on show at the same time. Or, to use another analogy, it is the world's biggest magazine stall, with each Web site an individual title, jostling for the attention of browsers in rivalry with at least half-a-million others. Viewers face a bewildering amount of competition for their attention, and most of what is on offer can be sampled at no cost. Even a site that attracts potentially loyal viewers risks having them seduced away to other sites by hyperlinks. Cursed by the short attention span of the stereotypical Net surfer, some viewers simply forget where they have been before. No wonder few Web sites are making money.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This excess of choice is tough on the viewer, too. He finds it hard to work out exactly what he likes reading, and ever harder to keep up with all that is available. As the surfer's "bookmark" list of favourite sites gets longer and longer, the chore of fetching content that changes by the day gets oppressive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The answer to this problem suggests itself: if the surfer won't go to the Web site, send the Web site to the surfer. Make the Web more like e-mail, "pushing" a site on to readers' screens without any effort on their part. In the real world of newspapers and magazines, this is a routine operation: it is exactly what a subscription does. Doing it with state-of-the-art Web sites, with glitzy graphics, sounds and creative animations, is a harder task.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some Web sites started off with little pushes. The first ones, like the hipper-than-hip HotWired, sent out regular messages by e-mail to readers. These drew attention to new articles on HotWired and, perhaps more significantly, continued to remind fickle surfers that the site actually still existed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But plain-looking e-mail is unlikely to satisfy the millions of Web surfers who have a penchant for noises and garish colours. These more demanding folk can now use "off-line Web browsers" to retrieve their favourite Web pages automatically--often without having to be physically present and put up with the delays that are the hallmark of the Web. Unfortunately, these off-line browsers are fiendishly complicated to use. And while they add an element of pushiness to the Web, this is really only a fa&#231;ade. Since Web sites are designed to be viewed on-line, browsing them off-line can have unpredictable consequences, with links that go nowhere and missing material.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What really excited the geeks this summer was Pointcast, described as a cross between television and the Web. It is just a program, running quietly in the background of your <font size=-1>PC</font> as you work. Every hour or so, Pointcast slurps news, sports and even lottery results from the Internet and stores them. On command--or once the computer has been out of action for a few minutes--it starts displaying the gathered stories, replete with <font size=-1>CNN</font>-like graphics and advertising. Readers can choose the sort of information they want to receive and how often they would like to have it updated. Once they have done so, everything else is automatic: it is as if your <font size=-1>PC</font> simply always knows the latest news and real-time share prices, and can display them at the click of a mouse.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Marimba, a Californian start-up company, has developed a similar type of technology called Castanet (not a reference to the musical instrument but a dreadful Internet pun). Castanet takes the Internet vocabulary back to the days of radio: servers become transmitters, browsers become receivers. A Castanet receiver works the same way a radio receiver works: it tunes into a transmitter and picks up whichever station you are tuned to. Unlike e-mail distribution, Castanet will allow a publisher to send out multimedia content.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Marimba's push model has snags: users may not want to receive everything they are sent and (which is perhaps more irksome) it will be cumbersome for the many Internet users who dial into the Net. These users, in contrast to those at universities and big companies, are connected to the Internet infrequently--and most are handicapped by possessing modem connections that are simply not capacious enough for multimedia information.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pointcast suffers similar defects. For a big company with a fast, open connection to the Net, Pointcast can turn acres of the computer screen into colourful snapshots of information. But for the Internet's millions of dial-up surfers, Pointcast offers precious little.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the biggest argument against turning a Net surfer into a couch potato is that it implies a return to a less desirable part of television: in producing mass-market junk in an effort to attract as many viewers as possible, it ends up pleasing almost nobody. Much of this is a result of the lowest-common-denominator nature of a broadcast medium; the chances are slim that whatever is on at a particular moment is exactly what you feel like watching. In contrast, Web surfing is a laser-focused process of picking exactly what you want, when you want it. The viewer is in control. Even the best of the Web's push schemes can offer only the crudest customisation; their viewers can pick channels of interest, not specific shows. Today's Web surfers may still scoff, but tomorrow's, reared on a remote control, will feel right at home.

</ul>

<br>Hammer engaged in an aggressive campaign of self-promotion--a campaign capped by the publication of several self-serving autobiographies that inspired admiring stories in a willing business press. He used secret Swiss slush funds to support Prince Charles's philanthropic causes in the daft hope that the Windsors would grease his way to a Nobel prize. His strategically recruited aides included James Roosevelt, a skint son of Franklin Roosevelt, Senator Albert Gore, the father of the vice-president of the United States, Marvin Watson, a crony of Lyndon Johnson's, and Howard Baker, a Republican bigwig who persuaded President Bush to pardon Hammer for the illegal gift of cash he gave to Richard Nixon in 1972.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Edward Jay Epstein, an experienced investigator in the fields of high finance and espionage, strips Hammer clean of his deceptions. With the help of newly accessible Comintern records and other material from Russian archives, voluminous <font size=-1>FBI</font> files and many interviews with Hammer's former lovers and with members of his family, he paints a vivid, compelling portrait of a thorough scoundrel.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At times Mr Epstein's dossier reads like a le Carr&eacute; novel. In 1920 Armand Hammer let his father, Julius, a New York doctor, go to prison for an illegal abortion he himself had performed. Then, going to the Soviet Union in his father's place, he masqueraded as an enlightened capitalist in order to cover up his role as money launderer for the Communists. Through the rest of his life, he continually revised his identity, covered up his business frauds, shuffled his women, betrayed his family and dipped into his companies' funds to pay bribes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Little attention is paid by Mr Epstein to Hammer's career as a conglomerator, and tothe way he pushed up the value of Occidental Petroleum shares as he acquired companies and cashed in on Libyan oil. But he does reveal how Hammer put fame before profits in, for instance, sinking $2.5 billion of Occidental Petroleum's money into fertiliser operations in the Soviet Union and coal mining in China.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is hard to believe now that Hammer was able to pass himself off for so long as peace-making agent between the United States and the Soviet Union. The confidence successive Soviet leaders invested in him as a go-between and a fixer was misplaced. Hammer had little influence within the White House during either the Carter or the Reagan administrations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After his death, it was apparent that Hammer had reneged on promises to support members of his family, a former lover and his illegitimate daughter. More than 100 claims were soon lodged against his estate, including a demands for $640,000 from the Reagan Presidential Foundation, for $250,000 from the Danielle Mitterrand Foundation and for $1.4m from the Salk Institute. All were charitable pledges on which Hammer had welshed.

THE DEATH MARCH
<p>NOTHING FOCUSES THE MIND LIKE A DEATH SENTENCE.</p>
<p>Armand Hammer received the grim news from his doctors in Los Angeles on October 12, 1990. Three days earlier, he had been in Virginia, at Albemarle Farms, the estate of the industrialist John Kluge. He was a guest at a weeklong bird shoot to which one hundred of the richest people in America had been invited. Lavish accommodations were provided, and prize pheasants had been flown in from England. The announced purpose of this event was to raise money to fund research to find a cure for cancer. In the midst of the first night's banquet, Hammer was forced to leave the table because of acute stomach and chest pains. His doctor, who traveled with him, initially thought it was something he ate and gave him medication and purges. But the pain intensified. He had trouble breathing and could not sleep. The next morning, while the other moguls went out to shoot pheasants, Hammer was carried aboard his private Boeing 727 jet and flown to his home in Los Angeles. At 6:45 P.M. on October 1 l, he was rushed to the emergency room of the UCLA Medical Centeran institution to which Hammer had donated generously.'</p>
<p>X rays showed massive damage to Hammer's shoulder and clavicle bones. Two consulting doctors noted a "diffuse moth-eaten pattern" of destruction and were in no doubt as to its cause: advanced cancer of the bone marrow. Hammer had been trained as a doctor, and he understood what this meant. His worst fear had come to pass: a cancer he had believed was in remission had spread out of control. He also knew that he could not withstand the debilitating radiation treatment for it. He was a ninety-two-year-old man severely weakened by chronic anemia, bronchitis, prostate enlargement, kidney ailments, and an irregular heartbeat. The prognosis was that he would die within a year.</p>
<p>When doctors had detected the multiple myeloma more than a year earlier, Hammer believed he could beat it. In 198I, President Reagan had appointed him chairman of the President's Cancer Panel, and Hammer had committed himself to raising $I billion to battle the disease. He had stamped his name on a host of research stations: the Armand Hammer Center for Cancer Biology at the Salk Institute, the Armand Hammer Cancer Research Laboratory at Stanford University, the Julius and Armand Hammer Health Sciences Center at Columbia University, and the Armand Hammer Center for Advanced Studies in Nuclear Energy and Health. He had offered a $I million Armand Hammer Cancer Prize to the scientist who found a cure. In an appearance on The Bill Cosby Show, he announced that the discovery of such a cure was imminent.</p>
<p>But in battling his own cancer, Hammer could not wait for science. He began using an herbal preparation from the jungles of Mexico that he took in a te negro, or black tea, three times a day. He confidently explained to his doctors that it contained an "antiplasterion" that would prevent the cancer cells from spreading (and in their medical reports they duly noted the mysterious black tea, which they were not allowed to analyze). Even though such unlicensed medicine was illegal to import, he arranged for security guards from his company, Occidental Petroleum, to fly it in on company planes in five-gallon containers. The te negro had seemed to work, and that summer he began to speak of his mortality conditionally, saying to associates "if I die" instead of"when I die."2 </p>

Edward Jay Epstein's investigation into the life of Armand Hammer exposes a tale of fraud, corruption, and personal betrayal that was carried out on such a grand scale and over such a long period of time that it is surely unique. Hammer was ninety-two when he died in 1990. A lengthy front-page obituary in The NewYork Times lauded him as a successful businessman "who long sought peace between the United States and the Soviet Union and financed research for a cancer cure." His philanthropy was noted, along with his vast art collection and his elevated social connections. But the official version of Hammer's life, which incorporated many of the major figures and key events of the twentieth century, was in fact a myth, carefully nurtured and embellished for nearly seventy years.
<p>Aided by newly available sources, Epstein has put together a gripping portrait of a ruthless, audaciously manipulative opportunist whose self-inventions have until now been widely accepted. Epstein gained unprecedented access to FBI files, SEC documents, and files on the Hammer family kept by Soviet intelligence agencies since the 1920s. He interviewed Hammer's mistresses, family, and close friends as well as the shadowy figures who assisted him in business deals. During his investigation, Epstein discovered that for many years Hammer had, like Richard Nixon, secretly taped conversations, many of them dealing with illegal activity. These tapes give an intimate view of a master con man at work.</p>
<p>Armand Hammer's remarkable ascent was set in motion in 1922, when Lenin wrote a secret letter to Stalin designating Hammer as their official "path" to the resources of American capitalism. In this role as Homo sovieticus, which was predicated on the idea that any means, no matter how ruthless or deceptive, was justified if it achieved the desired ends, Hammer created a place for himself on the international stage. How this was accomplished and maintained for the better part of a century is an amazing story. </p>

<p>ELEPHANTS suffered greatly during the billiards craze that swept America in the 1860s. Hunters had to gather as many as 50 tusks to find one with a grain even enough to supply the ivory from which the balls used for the game were crafted. Ivory prices rose sharply as a result, prompting Phelan &amp; Collender, the largest supplier of billiards equipment in America at the time, to offer $10,000 in gold to whoever could invent a substitute. The reward sent countless amateur scientists to their garden sheds to tinker with wood chips, glues, shellac and strips of muslin.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among them was John Hyatt of Illinois, a printer. He never won the Phelan &amp; Collender prize, despite filing two patents for variously composed billiard balls, but an accident in the course of his research led him to wealth as the head of the Celluloid Manufacturing Company. This firm produced products ranging from false teeth to shirt cuffs from a material that Hyatt had discovered after knocking over a jar of collodion, a solution of plant fibre in ether and alcohol. Printers used to paint collodion on to their fingertips to form a thin film to protect them while handling hot metal type. But the slick which Hyatt discovered in his cupboard in 1868 had formed a stiff, transparent lacquer that struck him as a potential coating for his elusive billiard balls. Further experiments led him to add camphor to the mixture; this created celluloid, the first thermoplastic, or material which could be repeatedly softened by heating and then moulded into a shape it would hold when cooled.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The early history of plastic and its predecessors, as recounted in Stephen Fenichell's entertaining book, is full of such lucky spills. Christian Sch&#246;nbein, a chemist at the University of Basle, discovered guncotton in 1846 when he mopped up a spill from a flask in which he had been distilling a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids. A few years earlier Charles Goodyear, a chaotic amateur experimenter, stumbled on a process for curing rubber, soon to be known as "vulcanisation" (a name thought up by a British rival in the raincoat business) by spilling raw latex and sulphur together on to a hot stove. And the synthetic mauve dye which started to pour from the vats of W.H. Perkin &amp; Sons' factory in Harrow in the 1850s, laying the foundations for much of the modern pharmaceutical industry, was another mop-up job, discovered when the firm's founder examined the rag with which he had cleaned up the spilt remains of a failed attempt to synthesise quinine. The story of plastic even includes a pair of human Spills, Daniel and George, two brothers who supplied the British army with 340,000 yards of rubberized cloth to keep it dry during the Crimean war, and later bankrupted themselves in patent battles with Goodyear.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From haphazard beginnings, plastics have grown in variety and sophistication to find ever more applications during what the author calls a "synthetic century". He tells the many strands of their story breezily, although with too many mixed metaphors: a critic of nylon is said to have "hit the nail right where it hurt". Plastic's image has fluctuated widely during that time: sophisticated bakelite was perfect for a streamlined, modern look in the 1920s; glamorous sheeny nylon was preferred to silk for stockings in the second world war; flexible Tupperware, made from plastic that no longer pretended to be anything other than artificial, fitted the forward-looking 1950s; styrofoam became a symbol of 1980s environmental carelessness. Inventors, hucksters, philanthropists and lunatics have all played their part. Their presence enlivens the tale of what Mr Fenichell rightly identifies as an emblematic material of the modern world.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Scientists said it could be never be seen by the naked eye, even in the night sky,
some two hundred miles above the equator. But the luminous tendril was
clearly visible to hundreds of watchers, about an hour after sunset and an hour
before sunrise, in the skies above Florida, Texas, New Mexico, and southern
California. As the space tether whirled eastward along the equatorial belt,
passing Hawaii en route to Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Puerto
Rico, and Baja California, it showed up against a field of stars and pinpoint
planets as a bright shining line, roughly three lunar diameters long.
<p>"This is the first man-made object in space visible as something other than a point of light," exclaimed Dr. Joseph A. Carroll--the scientist who first proposed the space tether experiment to NASA a decade before. "I couldn't see the space shuttle, but I could see fifteen pounds of string."</p>
<p>Those fifteen pounds of string had been spun from a high-density, high-strength polyethylene called Spectra into a fiber twelve miles long but just one thirty- second of an inch thick. As a polymer whose molecules are all oriented in the same direction, Spectra enjoys one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of any material on earth.</p>
<p>In the near future, space tethers as strong or stronger, as thin or thinner, will replace cumbersome, costly rockets for much of the heavy lifting in space.</p>
<p>Polyethylene, the plastic used to make space tethers, is also used to make grocery and dry-cleaning bags. Discovered by British scientists during World War II, it helped the Allies win the air war over the Axis powers in Europe. Without polyethylene for lightweight radar insulation, the RAF would have been unable to install radar on its airplanes. Without radar, the British would never have enjoyed the critical edge in surveillance that helped them overcome the Nazis' overwhelming superiority in aircraft and manpower.</p>
<p>"I just want to say one word to you, Ben.... Plastics. There's a great future in plastics. Think about it."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," Benjamin blankly replied. But I very much doubt he did. What would a bright, sensitive guy like Benjamin think about plastic, except to dismiss it out of hand as an alien substance foisted upon us by unscrupulous manufacturers with an eye toward cutting corners? If not strictly emblematic of all that is: fake and wrong with the modern material world, at least an uninvited guest at the party. </p>

Prophylactics to polystyrene, viscose to Velcro,  saran to cellophane: for better
or worse, we're married to plastic. In your refrigerator, your closet, your office,
your car--it's everywhere, and it's not going away. You eat with it, work with it,
play with it. Often, you even breathe it. Cheap, pliable, easily made, eminently
democratic, it symbolizes everything that's both wrong and right with our
culture.
<p>In Plastic: The Making of a Synthetic Century, Stephen Fenichell takes a fresh, irreverent look at the substance we all love to hate. The book moves from the early astonishment at such inventions as celluloid film and waterproof clothing; to the nylonstocking riots after World War II; to the revolutionary, yet practical, proliferation of Tupperware in the '50s. Fenichell's sweeping assessment of the social and economic revolutions brought on by plastic extends from the sublime to the absurd, the beautiful to the mundane, demonstrating how scientists, artists, politicians, and the buying public have all molded, and also been molded by, plastic.</p>
<p>By turns a hero and a villain, a useless fad and an essential commodity, plastic is the ideal indicator of how people think and live. With clarity, wit, and deadpan accuracy, Fenichell narrates a rollicking story about the thrills, chills, and accidental spills that led to the development of plastic, about the scientists and corporations who got rich (or went bankrupt) creating and selling synthetics, and about the rapidly changing culture of the twentieth century that plastic reflects.</p>
<p>Plastic brings together an extraordinary range of knowledge and Fenichell's canny eye for how our world works, making this one of the year's savviest, enjoyable, and most penetrating books on popular culture. </p>

<p>THE best coffee-table books are not the ones you leave out for display but
those you take to bed to browse through. As a tip for presents you may want to
give (or get), here is a selection of the season's best.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For literary tourists, or readers momentarily
bored by the novel they are reading, nothing could be better than <a
href="12ex376.html">An Atlas of
Literature</a> (Edited by Malcolm Bradbury. De Agostini; &#163;25 and $35).This
extraordinary compilation of 80 essays, complete with detailed city maps, is a
guide to the places where classics, old and new, western and non-western, were
written. It lists authors' homes (from Dante's to Isabel Allende's), publishing
houses where their books were accepted, refused and rewritten, and caf&eacute;s
and other hang-outs where they were endlessly and eloquentxly talked about.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<a href="12ex377.html">Paradise Transformed</a> (By Guy Cooper and
Gordon Taylor. Monacelli; &#163;35) is a gorgeous book illustrating the works of
more than two dozen modern landscape gardeners. It includes all sorts of styles:
traditionalists like Dan Kiley, "abstract" designers like George Hargreaves,
playful experimenters like Maggie Keswick and Charles Jencks, as well as a
Japanese master of rocks and water, Motoo Yoshimura.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nan Goldin is one of New York's best-known
art-photographers. Her work is shown in art museums across the world. <a href="12ex378.html">I'll be
your Mirror</a> (Scalo; $70) is the title of an exhibition of hers at New York's
Whitney Museum (ending January 5th). Her greeny-yellow pictures are mainly of
friends on the New York "scene", shot in bed, in the bath, playing Monopoly. Her
unsentimental eye owes something to a powerful early 20th-century German
photographer, August Sander; her feel for oddity and illness to the more recent
work of Diane Arbus. But she is warmer than either. Henri Cartier-Bresson
represents a more serene tradition in which art and reportage mix. <a href="12ex379.html">Henri
Cartier-Bresson and the Artless Art</a> (By Jean-Pierre Montier. Thames and
Hudson; &#163;50. Bulfinch; $75) is a beautifully illustrated study of his
60-year career. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If photography is one thing
painting has made room for in art museums, installation art is another. An object
of mystification or mockery on its first appearance, it is now so widely accepted
and taught that some painters fear for their future. <a href="12ex380.html">Installation Art</a> (By
Nicolas de Oliveira, Nicola Oxley and Michael Petry. Thames and Hudson;
&#163;17.95. Smithsonian Institution; $34.95) is a useful survey of a
fast-expanding genre, tracing its forebears in the early 20th-century
avant-garde. The photographs are good, though with "site-specific art" there is
no substitute for the site. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <a href="12ex381.html">Red Hot and
Blue</a> (By Amy Henderson and Dwight Blocker Bowers. Smithsonian Institution
Press; $39.95 and &#163;29.95) is schmaltzy, smiling and full of irresistible
pep, just like the American musical it celebrates. (The book accompanies an
exhibition at the Smithsonian in Washington.) It tells the story of musicals from
vaudeville to Stephen Sondheim and beyond, treating Broadway and Hollywood as
equals in the creation of an all-American art.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For browsers and lounge-potatoes, the ultimate
coffee-table book this season, however, may well be <a
href="12ex382.html">The Ultimate Encyclopedia
of Extreme Sports</a> (By Joe Tomlinson. Carlton; &#163;14.99). It lists 41
popular ways to get your adrenalin pumping, and perhaps kill yourself, by land,
air or sea. It starts with <font size=-1>BASE</font> jumping ("buildings,
antenna-tower, span, earth"), and includes ski-flying, sky-surfing, aggressive
in-line skating, extreme motocross, street luge, barefoot water-skiing,
unassisted deep diving, wake-boarding, as well as older challenges such as
mountaineering, high-wire acts and solo round-the-world yachting. The book
contains a handy list of addresses (postal and electronic) for people who want to
get in touch with groups that do these sports. But it is a fair guess that the
publishers of this entertaining guide are counting also on a vicarious, bedside
browsership.
