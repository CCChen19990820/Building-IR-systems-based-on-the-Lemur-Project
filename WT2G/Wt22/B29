Potato Salad                                                                    
                                                                                
2 slices bacon                                                                  
1/4 cup minced onion                                                            
1/4 cup finely chopped green pepper                                             
3 tablespoons bacon drippings                                                   
2/3 cup mayonnaise or salad dressing                                            
1/4 cup milk                                                                    
1 tablespoon prepared mustard                                                   
3 cups sliced cooked potatoes                                                   
4 hard cooked eggs, chopped                                                     
1/4 cup chopped dill pickles                                                    
Salt and pepper                                                                 
                                                                                
Fry bacon. Put bacon aside to drain. In drippings simmer the onion and green    
pepper. Remove and drain.                                                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
Mix together mayonnaise, milk,and mustard. Add crumbled                         
bacon. add the potatoes, eggs and pickles toss together well but lightly.       
Add seasonings to taste. Chill till ready to serve.                             
                                                                                
Note:                                                                           
Sometimes I do not bother to cook the onion and green pepper but simply add     
them to the potatoes with the crumbled bacon. I sometimes add a tablespoon of   
the bacon drippings to the mayonnaise and mix it all together.                  
                                                                                
Enjoy,                                                                          
Lei

Remember when... you first heard rumblings about this diminutive black          
guy who liked to wear women's lingerie getting hounded off a stadium            
stage by unruly Rolling Stones fans?                                            
                                                                                
..."1999" was first released as a single and then immediately tanked,           
even though it shimmered as if something much more profound was about           
to happen?                                                                      
                                                                                
...the first 30 or so come-hither seconds of the video for "When Doves          
Cry" had a weird way of making you feel real funny?                             
                                                                                
...Around The World In A Day was trounced by rock critics everywhere,           
even though it really wasn't that abominable after all?                         
                                                                                
...the entire universe swished in unison to the groove of "Oh Sheila"?          
(Yeah, that was by Ready For The World, but what kind of immemorial             
band name was that?)                                                            
                                                                                
...Sheila E., Sheena Easton and Wendy & Lisa were the coolest chicks            
on the planet, in no small part because of the fella they kept company          
with?                                                                           
                                                                                
..."Cream" reignited the legacy of Ray Parker Jr. (By pure                      
coincidence, this is the second gratuitous reference to Ray on this             
page... eerie. -- Afraid of no ghosts ed.), followed up by a                    
delectable homage to Frank Zappa in the form of "Diamonds And Pearls"?          
                                                                                
...the 1-800-NEW FUNK phone line was still operative, promising to              
provide all sorts of renegade offerings that no deceitful major record          
company would dare release?                                                     
                                                                                
Well, Chaos & Disorder will remind you of none of these things.                 
                                                                                
Note to ed.: This should compensate for 5 yrs. of self-flagellating             
overlong reviews worth 10x what I've gotten paid for them (besides,             
the album deserves it).

Toronto's arts newspaper                      .....free every Thursday          
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~          
SPINcycle                                                    spinCYCLE

                            JASON ANDERSON                                      
                                                                                
This week: Your usual assortment of 7-out-of-10s. Don't you wish we             
had one of those cute rating systems? Pinheads...                               
                                                                                
* TRAINSPOTTING (Premier/ EMI): An accoutrement to your crap Scottish           
accent, the soundtrack is designed to be a showcase of superhip U.K.            
rock and dance but the inclusion of Iggy's best pop ("Lust For Life"            
and "Nightclubbing") and Lou Reed's "Perfect Day" highlights the                
poverty of inspiration in the new material. Pulp scores but "Born               
Slippy" is the weakest of Underworld's recent output, Primal Scream's           
"Trainspotting" is a risible ramble and Elastica are still the worst            
band ever.                                                                      
                                                                                
* SHUFFLE DEMONS/Get Right (Stubby/ Outside): The opener "Have A Good           
One" is a bit weedy, but the rest of this EP proves Richard                     
Underhill's outfit is far from spent. "Tolerence" rides a supremely             
silly bass line from Mike Milligan, and "Show Me" and "Group Dreams"            
find the right combination of skronk and sleaze. The Demons should              
really get into scoring porno movies.                                           
                                                                                
* THE DELTA 72/The R&B Of Membership (Touch And Go): Mostly                     
instrumental, mostly hot, organ-led (in both senses) party rock. The ?          
& The Mysterians revival is now boarding.                                       
                                                                                
* NICOLETTE/Let No One Live Rent Free In Your Head (Talkin'                     
Loud/PolyGram): Like Everything But The Girl's Tracey Thorn, Nicolette          
got a boost by singing on Massive Attack's Protection. On her debut             
CD, she gets malevolent on your ass as she croons over an                       
appropriately apocalyptic collision of soul, jungle and electronica.            
Outside of "Song For Europe," it's short on tunes but long on doomy             
atmosphere.                                                                     
                                                                                
* MEAT BEAT MANIFESTO/Subliminal Sandwich (Nothing/Interscope/MCA):             
Two CDs of Jack Dangers' dense soundscapes means total information              
overload (check his work for Consolidated and Emergency Broadcast               
Network). Here's my one-sentence summation of what sounds like five             
years of toil: nowhere in the rubbery dub and melted hip-hop here is            
anything as thrilling as MBM's early singles, but Disc Two eats two             
steaks for breakfast.                                                           
                                                                                
* YOUNG NEHAMPKIN/Young Nehampkin (Indie): A loco local basement tape           
that opens with a shambling indie-rock boogie, dabbles with cut-rate            
dub effects (or else it's a sitar and a couple of kazoos) and peaks             
with "Painless," which cops a riff from Stereolab but nevertheless              
rides it ingeniously. I promise to never say anything disparaging               
about Rotate This' clientele ever again.                                        
                                                                                
* SYD STRAW/War And Peace (Capricorn/ PolyGram): "Hey, remember me? We          
met 10 years ago at CBGB's on New Year's Eve" begins the winsome                
"CBGB's," Syd Straw's open letter to a one-night stand on her first             
album since 1989's Surprise. She's doing fine, y'know, but why don't            
you call? Though she made her name with Joni-style warbling for the             
Golden Palominos, War And Peace is straightforward rock akin to                 
Concrete Blonde (Johnette Napolitano has a co-write). Sturdy, funny,            
charming... so why has War And Peace disappeared already? I mean, it's          
shorter than the book.

It's been rather noisy here in sci.astro as of late. Perhaps this               
essay will inject a little bit of signal into the noise.

DUST EVOLUTION IN THE UNIVERSE

This essay is about the evolution of dust in the Universe. In particular,       
I describe some ways that dust forms in dusty clouds, cycles through            
solar systems (even comets), through a star's late evolution and back           
into a nebula. I was not particularly interested in astronomical dust           
until I started studying these processes- now I think the processes are         
pretty fascinating. So here's my synopsis.                                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
-----------------------------------                                             
Some "Dusty" Clouds in the Universe                                             
-----------------------------------                                             
                                                                                
First, there is no such thing as a "standard `cloud of gas and dust'".          
There are different types of nebulae  with different physical                   
causes and processes. One might see the following classifications:              
                                                                                
diffuse nebula                                                                  
IR reflection nebula                                                            
supernova remnant                                                               
molecular cloud                                                                 
HII regions                                                                     
photodissociation regions                                                       
diffuse clouds                                                                  
                                                                                
Some distinctions between those types of nebula are that very different         
radiation processes are at work. For example, HII regions, like the             
Orion Nebula, where a lot of star-formation is taking place, are                
characterized as thermal emission nebulae. Supernova remnants, on the           
other hand, like the Crab Nebula, are characterized as nonthermal               
emission (synchrotron radiation).                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
-------------                                                                   
Introduction                                                                    
-------------                                                                   
                                                                                
The processing of dust in our galaxy is a fascinating study. The dust           
grains evolve cyclically- chemically and physically. The scenario that I        
describe here comes from J. Mayo Greenberg. It is called the grain              
"core-mantle" model. It has some pretty good observational and                  
theoretical arguments supporting it.                                            
                                                                                
See Greenberg's chapter in the book edited by Lou Allamandola and A.G.G.M       
Tielens (1989) or the paper in ApJ by Greenberg and Hage (1990).                
                                                                                
                                                                                
---------------------                                                           
Dust Grain Formation                                                            
---------------------                                                           
                                                                                
The large grains start with the silicate particles forming in the               
atmospheres of cool stars, and carbon grains in the atmospheres of cool         
carbon stars. Stars which have evolved off the main sequence, and have          
entired the giant phase of their evolution, are a major source of dust          
grains in the Galaxy.                                                           
                                                                                
How do we know that that dust is formed in the envelopes of late-evolved        
stars? We have some good observations. An observed (infrared) 9.7 micron        
emission silicate signature for cool evolved (oxygen-rich giant) stars.         
And an observed (infrared) 11.5 micron emission silicon carbide                 
signature for cool evolved (carbon-rich giant) stars. These help provide        
evidence that the small silicate particles in space came from the outer         
envelopes (ejecta) of these stars. (See Humphreys et al, (1972) ApJ 172,        
75, and Evans, A. The Dusty Universe, pg 164-167)                               
                                                                                
How do we know that dust wasn't formed in interstellar space? We know           
because the conditions in interstellar space are not suitable for the           
formation of silicate cores. The arguments are that: given an observed          
typical grain diameter a, the time for a grain to attain a, and given           
the temperature of interstellar gas, it would take considerably longer          
than the age of Universe for interstellar grains to form (see pg 147-148        
of Evans' book). Evans says in his book that grains are seen to form in         
the vicinity of nearby stars in real time. "Real time" meaning a) nova          
and supernova ejecta, and b) R Coronae Borealis, which seems to eject           
discrete clouds containing both gas and dust.                                   
                                                                                
Then supernovae/novae explosions of the star eject that material out into       
space. The dust that you see in supernovae remnants (like from M1) was          
mostly _not_ produced in the supernovae. It was present in the star's           
outer envelope before the supernovae explosion. The explosion just              
pushed that material outwards.                                                  
                                                                                
Note that new grains _can_ form in the debris of the supernovae explosion       
(even easier in the debris of a novae explosion) but that material has          
to be quite cool, so it takes some time (say on the order of a year)            
after an explosion for the debris to be cool enough for grains to form.         
It's a race between dropping temperature, which favors grain formation,         
and dropping density, which opposes it.                                         
                                                                                
When the grains have cooled down to about 15K, those silicates are the          
cores for the growth of mantles of ices. The mantles are formed by              
accretion of (gas phase) atoms and molecules of oxygen, carbon,                 
nitrogen, sulfur, along with hydrogen. The grains are nonspherical, and         
various sticking processes cause other simple molecules (H2O, CO, H2S,          
CH3OH, OCS, OCN- etc.) to stick. The mantle ices are always being               
photoprocessed by ultraviolet radiation from either distant stars or by         
UV created by cosmic rays or from local hot stars and/or stellar winds.         
The photoprocessing changes the basic composition of the ices and causes        
some complex organic refractory residues to form.                               
                                                                                
So now the heavily photoprocessed material is out in a diffuse                  
environment (diffuse cloud). That cloud may eventually become a denser          
molecular cloud. In the denser clouds, more organic mantle formation            
occurs, layering the silicate core- like the rings in a tree trunk. The         
innermost layers of the dust grain have been the most irradiated, and           
the outermost layers are the result of the most recent processes.               
                                                                                
Then, within those molecular clouds, critical densities lead to star            
formation, and that dust gets captured and becomes part of the new              
star, and the cycle stars all over again. A typical grain anywhere in           
space will have undergone at least 20 cycles (And remember that, in             
addition, new grains are formed.)

Dust as a Driving Force                                                         
------------------------                                                        
                                                                                
Dust is an important driving force in the development of a protostar's          
accretion disk. In particular, it has a large effect on the turbulence          
and convection in the disk. Before the dust grains settle into a                
midplane region, (and before the T-Tauri phase of the protostar) the            
homogenized distribution of the grains are a primary cause of opacity,          
leading to steep temperature gradients and convection and turbulence.           
(Other driving forces for turbulence in this early stage may be the             
angular momentum in the Solar Nebula by infalling matter, and the               
thermal energy liberated by gravitational collapse.)                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
-----------------------                                                         
Dust Grain Destruction                                                          
-----------------------                                                         
                                                                                
How are the grains destroyed? There are some ultraviolet processes which        
lead to grain "explosions" (d'Hendecourt et al., 1985 Astr Ap, 152, 130;        
Greenberg, J.M., 1976, Ap. Space Sci, 39, 9). Evans' book also describes        
evaporation, sputtering (when an atom or ion strikes the surface of a           
solid with enough momentum to eject atoms from it), and grain-grain             
collisions (which has a major influence on the grain size distribution),        
as well.                                                                        
                                                                                
These destructive processes happen in a variety of places. Some grains          
are destroyed in the supernovae/novae explosion (and then some grains           
form sometime afterwards). Some of the dust is ejected out of the               
protostellar disk in the strong stellar winds that occur during a               
protostar's active T Tauri phase. Plus there are some pretty                    
complicated gas-phase processes in a dense cloud where ultraviolet              
photons eject energetic electrons from the grains into the gas.                 
                                                                                
Dust grains incorporated into stars are also destroyed, but only a              
relatively small fraction of the mass of a star-forming cloud                   
actually ends up in stars.  This means a typical grain goes through             
many molecular clouds and has mantles added and removed many times              
before the grain core is destroyed.                                             
                                                                                
                                                                                
---------------------                                                           
Dust Grain Recycling                                                            
---------------------                                                           
                                                                                
I said previously that a typical grain anywhere in space will have              
undergone at least 20 cycles. How does this work, since a typical star          
lives for 5+ billion years, and the time since the Big Bang is only 15          
billion years (say)?                                                            
                                                                                
Mayo Greenberg explains: "The mean star production rate of 12 solar             
masses per year implies an interstellar medium turnover time of ~5*10^9         
years, so that this is the absolute max lifetime of a dust particle no          
matter how resistant to destruction. If we use a mean molecular                 
cloud-diffuse cloud period of 2*10^8 years (10^8 years in each), then a         
typical grain anywhere in space will have undergone at least 20 cycles          
so that, for example, the typical diffuse cloud dust particle age is            
greater than 10^9 years and consists of a mix of particles which have           
undergone a wide variety of photoprocessing."                                   
                                                                                
So the grain recycling works through molecular clouds with the formation        
and destruction of grain mantles. One time in 20 or so, the grain core          
gets incorporated into a star, and is destroyed.  The other times, the          
grain gets ejected, and only the mantle is destroyed.

Gehrz concludes in his last section titled: "The Ecology of Stardust in         
the Galaxy" that:                                                               
                                                                                
1. M stars, RLOH/IR stars and M supergiants are the primary sources of          
silicates, while carbon stars, WR stars and novae produce most of the           
carbon and SiC. Novae, supernovae, and WR stars may be responsible for          
most of the grains with chemical anomalies.                                     
                                                                                
2. The current star formation rate implies that star formation is               
depleting the interstellar medium (ISM) gas by some 3 to 10 solar masses        
per year.                                                                       
                                                                                
3. There is a deficit in stardust production/grain destruction.                 
Supernovae shock waves destroy ISM grains on very short time-scales             
(Seab, 1987, _Interstellar Processes_, Hollenbach and Thronson ed.              
Reidel) processing 10-30 solar masses per year and destroying 0.1-0.3 solar     
masses per year in dust. Gehrz estimates that 0.01-0.08 solar masses per        
year of dust is returned to the ISM by stars. He feels that grain growth        
in dark clouds is an attractive mechanism to make up the dust deficit.          
                                                                                
-----------                                                                     
Comet Dust                                                                      
-----------                                                                     
                                                                                
The isotope ratios of comet and interstellar dust are very similar,             
indicating a common origin (see R.F. Knacke chapter: "Comet Dust" in IAU        
Symposium No. 135, _Interstellar Dust_ ed. Allamandola and Tielens,             
publ. by Kluwer, 1989). Interplanetary dust particle isotope ratios are         
quite different.                                                                
                                                                                
In this section I expand on the dusty link between the molecular clouds         
and comets in a solar system.                                                   
                                                                                
Long-period comets are thought to be pristine, unaltered relics since           
their formation. They may be the best probes of ancient Solar System            
(and pre-solar) processes available to us.                                      
                                                                                
A long-period comet in a highly eccentric orbit with a perihelion               
distance of only a few solar radii will experience a range of diverse           
conditions as it traverses its orbit (Lewis, 1995). Almost all of the           
time it will be so far from the Sun that it will be too cold for                
evaporation of ices to occur. When it passes through the terrestrial            
planet region, evaporation will be rapid enough to blow away small              
grains, but the largest grains may resist entrainment and stay behind on        
the comet nucleus, beginning the formation of a dust layer. Near                
perihelion, the heating and evaporation rate will be so great, that no          
dust can be retained.                                                           
                                                                                
Therefore, the thickness of dust layers covering the nuclei of a comet          
can indicate how closely and how often a comet's perihelion travels are         
to the Sun. If a comet has an accumulation of thick volatile-depleted           
dust layers, it may have frequent perihelion passages that don't                
approach the Sun too closely.                                                   
                                                                                
This thick accumulation of dust layers is actually a good description of        
virtually all of the periodic *short-period* comets. The general                
conclusion of studies by David Brin (UCSD), Harry Houpis (UCSD), Asoka          
Mendis (UCSD), Fraser Fanale (U HI), James Salvail (U HI), Paul Weissman        
(JPL), Hugh Keiffer (USGS), and others has been that dust layers with           
thicknesses of order meters may accumulate on the surfaces of                   
short-period comet nuclei.                                                      
                                                                                
Note that the accumulation of dust layers over time would change the            
physical character of the short-period comet. A dust layer both inhibits        
the heating of the cometary ices by the Sun (the dust is very opaque and        
a poor conductor of heat), and slows the loss of gases from below. A            
comet nucleus in an orbit typical of short period comets would quickly          
decrease its evaporation rate to the point that neither a coma or tail          
would be detectable. Such a body may be described by terrestrial                
astronomers as a low-albedo near-Earth asteroid. It would be able to            
retain much of its ices over its entire dynamical lifetime (of ~100 M           
yr).                                                                            
                                                                                
Comet dust can provide clues to comets' orgin, and the formation of our         
solar system. There are two main models about where comets came from:           
1) the interstellar model and 2) the solar system model. The remaining          
portion of this essay came from information in Science News 149, June 1,        
1996, pg. 346-347.                                                              
                                                                                
The interstellar model is the following. It says that ices formed on            
dust grains in the dense cloud that preceded the Sun. The mix of ice and        
dust then gathers together into a comet without appreciable chemical            
modification. J. Mayo Greenberg first proposed this idea in 1986.               
                                                                                
In the solar system model, the ices that formed in the interstellar cloud       
didn't initially gather together, but vaporized as the ices to become part      
of the accretion disk of gas and dust around the protosun. The vaporized        
ices later resolidified and assembled into comets. So the comets in this        
model would have a little bit different composition than those comets           
that were made directly from interstellar ice.                                  
                                                                                
Comet Hyakutake data has been very good so far for providing some clues         
to the above.                                                                   
                                                                                
Michael Mumma's et al's IR observations from the IRTF detected ethane in        
the comet. He thought at first that it showed that the comet originated         
near Jupiter's orbit, which had a variety of hydrocarbons. Now he thinks        
that the comet originated directly from a chilly part of the                    
interstellar cloud (which can't exceed 20K). He has some confirming             
evidence for this theory from the fact that Hyakutake's nucleus has very        
little carbon monoxide, which makes chemical sense if the carbon is tied        
up in heavier molecules like ethane.                                            
                                                                                
-----------                                                                     
-----------                                                                     
                                                                                
See, I'll bet you didn't know before that those annoying little dust            
particles are significant constituents of the Universe and vital components     
of astrophysical processes.

I condensed parts of this essay from three or four shorter dust essays          
and one long thread titled "Supernovae Distribution" running on                 
sci.astro in January 1996. I want to thank Steve Willner in particular          
for his comments on that sci.astro thread.

     Altamonte Springs, FL   The Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy     
Artists (ASFA) has announced the official nominees for the 11th Annual          
Chesley Awards.                                                                 
                                                                                
     The Chesley, named for the great astronomical artist, Chesley              
Bonestell, was started by ASFA in 1985 as a means for the SF and Fantasy art    
community to recognize individual works and achievements during a given         
year. This year's Awards are for works and achievements in the period from      
January 1 through December 31, 1995 by both ASFA and non-ASFA members.          
                                                                                
     Ballots will be distributed to all full or associate ASFA members and      
must be postmarked no later than July 27, 1996 to be counted. The results       
will be announced at the Chesley Awards Ceremony to be held on Friday,          
August 30, 1996 during L.A.con III, the 54th World Science Fiction

CLIPPER GRAHAM INCIDENT INVESTIGATION BOARD CONVENES                            
                                                                                
     A five-member board, chaired by former astronaut Vance                     
Brand, is convening this week at the White Sands Missile                        
Range, NM, to investigate last week's post-landing incident                     
involving the Clipper Graham (DC-XA) rocket.                                    
                                                                                
     Brand presently is Assistant Chief of Flight Operations                    
Directorate and Chief of Shuttle and Flight Support Office at                   
NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, CA. Other                        
members of the board are: George Hopson, Marshall Space                         
Flight Center, Huntsville,  AL;  Charles E. Harris, Langley                     
Research Center, Hampton, VA; Lt. Col. David Sharp, USAF                        
Safety Center, NM;  and Warren Wiley, Kennedy Space Center, FL.                 
                                                                                
    Progess of the board's investigation will be released as                    
events warrant.  The board anticipates submitting a final                       
report in approximately two months.                                             
                                                                                
     On July 31, Clipper Graham successfully flew a two- minute,                
20-second flight profile -- the fourth in the current series --                 
but tipped over and caught fire when one of four landing gears                  
failed to deploy.

Now that the word has lost some of its currency and is devolving from           
its Nirvana-inspired heyday back to its humbler, lumbering roots,               
"grunge" can once again be used. Thank God, because there never really          
has been a better way to describe the sound Neil Young makes with               
Crazy Horse.                                                                    
                                                                                
Marc Weisblott aside, most thinking people have come to accept Neil's           
work as simple genius, glorious in its ragged, grungy majesty. As               
messy as any of the individual components might sound -- the                    
distorted, screeching, weeping guitars (Young and Frank "Pancho"                
Sanpedro), the rumbling bass (Billy Talbot) and the thundering,                 
seismic percussion (Ralph Molina) -- together these guys make the kind          
of music that inspires whole new generations of kids to pick up an              
instrument and try to make some rock 'n' roll of their own. The truly           
frightening part is that, with the exception of Sampedro (who replaced          
the late Danny Whitten in 1975), Young and Crazy Horse have been doing          
this consistently since Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere in 1969. Who            
else has stayed so good, so cool, for so long?                                  
                                                                                
Although it's certainly not an entry-level album for someone trying to          
get into Young's sound for the first time, Broken Arrow (taking its             
title from a Young song for Buffalo Springfield) still delivers all             
the goods. Contrary to the way he sequences most of his albums, three           
long (between seven and 10 minutes), meandering, extremely Neil songs           
come first in the set followed by three shorter, poppier numbers.               
Differentiating between them is pointless -- they're Neil Young songs           
and that ought to be description enough.                                        
                                                                                
The final track, an eight-minute cover of Jimmy Reed's laconic blues,           
"Baby What You Want Me To Do," underlines the album's aesthetic.                
Recorded live amidst the din of a California roadhouse, Young still             
manages to infuse a sub-demo-quality recording with an unequivocal              
dignity. Only Neil would even think to try. Only Neil would succeed.

Corinna Mergelsberg was looking for an Eggplant Caviar recipe.  This one        
sounds similar to what she was looking for.  I've used this recipe for          
both a dip and sandwich spread.  It's from 'Vegetarian Cooking' in the          
Australian Womans Weekly series.                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
Eggplant Spread                                                                 
                                                                                
1 large eggplant, peeled and chopped                                            
salt                                                                            
2 tablespoons oil                                                               
1 clove garlic, crushed                                                         
1/4 cup tahini                                                                  
2 tablespoons lemon juice                                                       
1/4 teaspoon paprika                                                            
                                                                                
Place eggplant on a wire rack, sprinkle with salt, stand for 20 minutes,        
rinse under cold water, drail on absorbent paper.                               
                                                                                
Heat oil in medium saucepan, add eggplant and garlic, stir over low heat        
for about 10 minutes (or microwave on high about 6 minutes) or until            
tender.  Blend or process eggplant mixture, tahini and juice until              
smooth.  Transfer to serving dish, sprinkle with paprika.

extended family shut each other out. It's a measure of Techine's craft          
that he's careful to keep the audience in the dark and then,                    
paralleling the changes in the central relationship, slowly let us in.          
On the surface a conventional family drama about mid-life and its               
ultimate crisis -- the death of one's parents -- this is a superbly             
dispassionate examination of the lies people tell themselves.                   
                                                                                
An old woman, Berthe (Marthe Villalonga), is too infirm to continue             
living alone, so she is shuttering her family homestead to live in              
town with her daughter, Emilie (Catherine Deneuve), and son-in-law,             
Bruno (Jean-Pierre Bouvier). It's obvious no one is happy with the              
arrangement.                                                                    
                                                                                
For Emilie and Bruno, it's a painful twist in their otherwise dull but          
harmonious existence. Partners in their own legal practice, they have           
dutifully raised two children and are now passing time. But no longer:          
Berthe's presence exposes the void at the core of their relationship.           
Finally, there is an outside observer to watch them go through their            
daily rituals and listen to their empty conversations.                          
                                                                                
Emilie goes to visit Antoine, a doctor (Daniel Auteuil), and your               
first instinct is that this man is her lover. This is exactly what              
Techine wants you to think because if Emilie and Antoine were not               
sister and brother they would be lovers. Soul-mates though childhood,           
they share a bond so strong that, even though their paths have left a           
gulf between them, they are incapable of keeping secrets.                       
                                                                                
As their mother decays before them, brother and sister engage in a              
psychological tug-of-war that reflects their respective psyches, left-          
brain versus right-brain, sense versus sensibility. Antoine, despite            
his medical rigor, is passionate and needy. Emilie, despite her                 
maternal posturing, is aloof; hers is an emotional vacancy -- she just          
doesn't care. That is, until she recognizes that with the death of her          
mother she is also mourning the passage of her childhood romance with           
her brother, their mutual favorite season.                                      
                                                                                
The performances, especially by Deneuve, who is cast so convincingly            
against type, are exceptional in the way they suggest a character's             
history without having to refer to it. The film flags only when the             
focus shifts to Emilie's children. We don't need to see them so much            
to know that, with such role models, they're well on track for crises           
of their own.

Issue 39, July 1996                                                             
Official Newsletter of the Galileo Project                                      
http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/mess39/                                         
                                                                                
      From the Project Manager                                                  
      Bill O'Neil                                                               
      Galileo Project Manager                                                   
                                                                                
      The first satellite encounter of Galileo's long-awaited Jupiter           
      System orbital tour was a grand success-in many respects it was           
      successful way beyond our greatest expectations! We found                 
      evidence of a Ganymede magnetosphere, hints of an atmosphere, and         
      Ganymede surface features that are absolutely mind-boggling. And          
      we also captured truly stunning images of Jupiter, Europa, and            
      Io. Already we have a great bounty of science data from eight of          
      the Orbiter's ten instruments and the radio science Doppler to            
      apply to our three co-equal Galileo science objectives-the                
      Jupiter atmosphere, magnetosphere, and satellites. These data             
      will provide powerful insights into the Jupiter system as they            
      are analyzed worldwide over the coming years.                             
                                                                                
      The spacecraft itself-including the tape recorder-performed               
      perfectly throughout the entire encounter and continues to be             
      flawless in the ongoing data return. Navigation was as                    
      spectacular as ever and used the brand-new, real-time, optical            
      navigation image return at over 200-to-1 data compression.                
                                                                                
      The Ganymede-1 encounter marked two absolutely momentous                  
      milestones for Galileo-both a beginning and a completion. The             
      science data mark the joyous beginning of the great bounty of             
      science we will continuously reap from the Galileo Orbiter over           
      the next year and a half. The successful encounter also marks a           
      joyous completion-the recovery of the Galileo Orbiter Mission             
      without its high-gain antenna!                                            
                                                                                
      Over the past three years-in parallel with preparing for the              
      precise delivery of the Probe and Orbiter to Jupiter, orbit               
      insertion, and the capture and return to Earth of the probe data,         
      and performing the second-ever spacecraft encounter of an                 
      asteriod and Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Jupiter impact                        
      observations-we developed extensive new software for our main             
      spacecraft computers and most of the science instruments. And,            
      after the tape recorder problems hit us last October just two             
      months before arrival, we figured out what was wrong with the             
      recorder and then added even more software to the new flight              
      package so the central computer could make the recorder behave            
      itself.                                                                   
                                                                                
      In May we completely reloaded the central computer (CDS) by               
      radioing every bit-literally every one and zero-of the new flight         
      software package to Galileo. This software enabled the Orbital            
      Mission. It was truly a complete brain transplant over a                  
      400-million-mile radio link. The new software was also radioed to         
      Galileo science instruments and the attitude control computer.            
                                                                                
      The new CDS capabilities and major DSN enhancements were first            
      used in June to return virtually all the fields and particles             
      data that Galileo recorded while flying through the Io torus on           
      Arrival Day, December 7. These data are also producing impressive         
      findings that will be published in the very near future. The              
      already announced evidence of Io's iron core and magnetic field           
      was obtained earlier from readouts of the magnetometer itself and         
      the Doppler data.                                                         
                                                                                
      We did have some problems at the Ganymede encounter. The                  
      energetic particles detector (EPD) instrument shut itself off             
      before the encounter. It has now been determined that there is a          
      flaw in the EPD internal fault detection logic. Workarounds are           
      planned to operate the EPD for the inbound magnetosphere survey           
      and Ganymede-2 encounter until a permanent patch is installed.            
                                                                                
      The near-infrared mapping spectrometer (NIMS) became anomalous a          
      day after Ganymede closest approach. After finding nothing                
      fundamentally wrong with the instrument, we recently reloaded its         
      flight software and restarted it. NIMS has operated properly              
      since the restart. We have taken some precautions for NIMS at             
      Ganymede-2 in the event NIMS has a transient problem associated           
      with the near-Jupiter environment.                                        
                                                                                
      Well before the encounter, continuing testbed testing of the new          
      flight software found a problem with the CDS handling of NIMS             
      data playback from the tape recorder. Consequently, all the other         
      data were played back first while this problem was diagnosed and          
      a software patch developed. The patch has just been installed,            
      and the NIMS data will be played back during a second pass                
      through the tape recorder in August.                                      
                                                                                
      We are on a marathon now. By design, on June 27, Ganymede's               
      gravity reduced Galileo's orbital period from 7 months down to            
      just 2 months. There are nine more satellite encounters in the            
      next 16 months-three each with Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa!            
      The finalization of the detailed spacecraft encounter sequences           
      and playback sequences and frequent updates of the onboard                
      playback tables is a continuous process on a Just-In-Time                 
      schedule to minimize cost and maximize responsiveness.                    
                                                                                
      With its new brain, instrument, and attitude control computer             
      software, and very major enhancements by the DSN to receive               
      signals ten thousand times weaker than originally planned, the            
      Galileo Orbital Mission is off to a great start.The development           
      and operations teams of the Project and the Deep Space Network            
      have done an absolutely magnificent job of once again making              
      Project Galileo the brightest star in our universe!

BNR Football Forecaster '96 is a program that attempts to accurately predict    
the outcomes of the 1996 NFL games. The predictions are based on formulas,      
which, in turn, are based on performance indexes, team ratings, home/visitor    
standings and a compilation of 11 years of statistics.                          
                                                                                
BNR Football Forecaster is VERY simple to use. Unlike other Football            
Projection Software, which requires the user to enter reams of statistics,      
games, player information and other data, BNR Football Forecaster only          
requires the user to enter the scores from games at the end of each week.       
                                                                                
Initial projections for EVERY game in the 1996 season have already been         
calculated, and are available. From there, simply enter scores from the games   
each week, and Adjusted Projections are then calculated for the remaining       
games in the season.                                                            
                                                                                
Last years version of this program, BNR Football Forecaster '95, had a          
straight up, win/loss accuracy of approximately 87%.

DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION                                           
                                                                                
On Announcement Regarding Possible Early Life on Mars                           
                                                                                
Today's announcement of scientific evidence for possible early life on          
Mars reignites the excitement of discovery and pioneering spirit which          
motivates all science, and reinforces the need to continue our                  
national investment in scientific research.                                     
                                                                                
The 4.5-billion-year-old meteorite which offers this unprecedented              
potential for new scientific knowledge was found in Antarctica during           
an ongoing National Science Foundation research  project.  It is                
ironic that we found signposts to possible life outside of earth by             
searching in the most remote location on earth.  Antarctica is `the             
mother lode' of meteorites, and has yielded more than 16,000                    
meteorites so far -- close to one-half of the world's scientific                
samples. The annual hunt for Antarctic meteorites is like a                     
bargain-priced space mission that lets scientists explore                       
extraterrestrial worlds without leaving their home planet.                      
Occasionally one of the samples evolves into a treasure of new                  
knowledge that reveals itself slowly and gradually, through scientific          
scrutiny.  In the case of the meteorite discussed today, it was only            
by using the most recent and advanced scientific equipment that                 
researchers were able to begin to unlock its mysteries.  The                    
NSF-funded science team which discovered the meteorite -- led by                
researchers Bill Cassidy and John Schutt of the University of                   
Pittsburgh -- were not even focused on the implications of organic              
life on other planets when they plucked the now-famous space rock from          
the frozen continent in 1984.                                                   
                                                                                
In spite of the many impressive scientific advances that seem to occur          
at an ever faster pace, there is still so much we don't know about our          
universe and the life it holds. The results announced today are not             
definitive, as the research team itself points out.  Rigorous science           
will continue to unfold the nature and origins of life, whether on              
earth or elsewhere in the universe.                                             
                                                                                
We live in a golden age of science, which we hope will continue to              
unlock the secrets of the unknown for the benefit of all humankind.

include :                                                                       
                                                                                
- Vector graphics objects to reduce bandwidth requirements and simplify         
  animation development.                                                        
                                                                                
- Bitmap graphics(GIF and JPEG).                                                
                                                                                
- Sound (MIDI and WAV).                                                         
                                                                                
- User-interaction objects.                                                     
                                                                                
- Web-protocols support. http(GET/POST), ftp, and file URLs are                 
  supported. Access to file URLs is by default prohibited due to security       
  considerations.                                                               
                                                                                
- Portability and architecture independence.                                    
                                                                                
- Security, interpreted programs is executed in a safe environment.             
                                                                                
The client has builtin damage-repair and double-buffering to achieve high       
performance graphics. Animations are easier to create in E than in              
traditional languages, due to the declarative nature of the E                   
graphicssystem.                                                                 
                                                                                
AweThor is an authoring tool for CandleWeb that simplifies the task of          
creating animations and graphics in E. AweThor is available as shareware        
for $100(US).

New features in this release of CandleWeb :                                     
                                                                                
- Composite objects. The language now has support for user-defined              
  composite objects.                                                            
                                                                                
- Support for dynamic loading of libraries and automatic revision control       
  to store library copies locally.                                              
                                                                                
- A new parser written in PCCTS has allowed us to clean up the language,        
  and bring it somewhat closer to the C programming language in syntax.         
                                                                                
- Global variables.                                                             
                                                                                
- Local function declarations.                                                  
                                                                                
- Regular expressions, through the new function regmatch.                       
                                                                                
- Support for MIDI and WAV on Win95 and Unix platforms using the Unix           
  Sound Standard(USS). Linux has support for USS. Can play single or            
  continuous sounds asynchronously.                                             
                                                                                
- Better color support for X11 :                                                
  1. 24-bits support.                                                           
  2. On PseudoColor it does not install a private colormap by default           
     anymore.                                                                   
  3. Use the -perfect option to install a private colormap.                     
  4. When -perfect is specified it uses a dithering technique to achieve        
     2048 virtual colors.                                                       
                                                                                
- HTTP post is now supported through the function post().                       
                                                                                
- Other new builtin functions : optimizeObjects, contentType, substr,           
  getWindowSize, read, write, and link.                                         
                                                                                
- New functionality in the translation attribute : Motion(for motion of the     
  mousecursor), ResizeWindow, Transparent (to send matching events onwards      
  to the next inputarea).                                                       
                                                                                
This release also include number of bug-fixes , and some speed                  
optimizations to the interpreter.

                           JOE'S APARTMENT                                      
                                                                                
Starring Jerry O'Connell and Megan Ward. Written and directed by John           
Payson. (PG)                                                                    
                                                                                
                           (eee of 5 eyes)                                      
                                                                                
                                  by                                            
                            Alex Patterson                                      
                                                                                
The cockroach is the most despised insect on earth, a creature even             
Albert Schweitzer couldn't resist squashing. Folks who'll line up to            
watch a psycho-killer on a head-pulling rampage still cringe at the             
sight of these minute monsters. (I think it's the antennae that do              
it.) So be warned: in Joe's Apartment, the hero shares his place with           
approximately 20,000 of the revolting little brown guys.                        
                                                                                
If the prospect of bugs in cornflakes upsets you, stop reading now. On          
the other hand, if you like the idea of foul-mouthed, wise-cracking             
roaches (All-singing! All-dancing! All-swearing!) choreographed into            
Busby Berkeley routines -- not to mention more toilet humor (horse              
manure, urinal cakes) than a Jim Carrey triple-feature -- you're in             
for an infestation of laughs.                                                   
                                                                                
In the opening frames, Joe (Jerry O'Connell, one of the Stand By Me             
kids) arrives in New York from Iowa, and nabs a filthy flat in the              
punks-and-panhandlers East Village. He also finds his dream girl                
(Megan Ward), a pretty idealist intent on transforming an Avenue B              
bombsite into a community garden. But everything's a no-go until Joe's          
live-in vermin -- as intractable as the Teamsters and almost as ugly -          
- grant their permission. In this film, cucarachas aren't waiting for           
a nuclear holocaust, they already rule the planet.                              
                                                                                
With its spectacular digital trickery, its mondo-disgusto sensibility           
and its weird cameos (crooner Don Ho, Man From U.N.C.L.E.'s Robert              
Vaughn), writer-director John Payson's popular MTV short makes its              
transition to the big screen surprisingly successfully. I would have            
rated it more than three eyeballs had I not noticed that most of the            
audience wasn't enjoying it as much as I was. Despite being funnier             
and scarier than The Frighteners, I suspect Joe's Apartment is a movie          
many people would rather smack with a shoe.

2 tablespoons butter                                                            
                                                                                
	Soften the yeast in the lukewarm milk.                                         
	Into a large bowl put the sugar, salt and butter.  Pour in the                 
scalded milk and let cool to lukewarm.  Add the eggs and the yeast              
mixture.  Beat well.                                                            
	With a wooden spoon stir in 2 cups of flour and beat well.                     
Gradually add enough more flour to make a dough which will pull away from       
the sides of the bowl.  Beat smooth and until no flour pockets remain.          
Cover the bowl with a thin towel and let rise in a warm place until             
doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.                                             
	Put the dough on a lightly floured board and knead very well.                  
Divide into 2 equal parts.  Mold into loaves, kneading as you work to           
eliminate all bubbles and get a light, smooth dough.                            
	Fill buttered 9x5x3 pans 3/4 full.  Cover and let rise in a warm               
place until risen to tops of the pans and well rounded in the center.           
	Bake 10 mintues in a preheated 425 degree oven, then 40 minutes at             
350 degrees.  Cool on racks and then brush with melted butter.

   This file only includes the latest Albums Chart, but we have much more.

| (c) 1996 World Charts                   Issue 31 - Week 31 - July 29, 1996 |  
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| This week the votes from 1088 people have been used to compile this chart. |  
| Send your votes to albums@worldcharts.nl and you'll get the next chart     |  
| sent to you personally. Ask for the document that tells how to vote. Just  |  
| send a message with subject line 'send doc' and you'll know all about it.  |  
| The format for every line with a vote is:  points title [ ID ]             |  
| YOU MUST INCLUDE THE ID NUMBER, and between brackets! It is NOT optional.  |  
| Use [] or [0000] as the ID number for albums not yet listed in the chart.  |  
| You can allocate a maximum of 20 points, BUT NOT MORE THAN 5 FOR ONE ALBUM.|  
| An example can be found at the bottom of this list. LOOK AT IT FIRST!      |  
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| All your votes and comments should be sent to albums@worldcharts.nl.       |

| list anymore. Send a message with #nocall if you don't want the reminders. |

 Pink Floyd takes back the #1 position from Roxette. Fans from Pink Floyd and   
 Roxette are in a fierce battle to get their favourite artist on that most      
 important position in the list. They are changing places every few weeks,      
 which will probably continue to happen until another group or artist decides   
 to jump to #1, sending both Pink Floyd and Roxette down the chart. This        
 third group or artist could very well be Def Leppard or Radiohead, both        
 climbing upwards with steady force.                                            
                                                                                
 In its third week TAFKAP/Prince is only at #19, which is a bit disappointing,  
 considering the fact that his single Dinner with Delores shot to number one    
 in our global Singles Top 100 last week, before most national sales charts     
 even had it listed. At this moment the Prince fans value the single better     
 than the album, but this may change in the near future.                        
                                                                                
 With 1088 people being active voters for our global Albums Top 100, we trust   
 that the list will get more and more weight on the Internet over time. Be      
 sure to make your friends aware of this Chart, and get them to vote for your   
 favourite artists. We can't have Pink Floyd and Roxette battle it out          
 forever. Send some other artists up the charts, and watch what happens in      
 the next few weeks. Stay with us...                                            
                                                                                
                                                                                
 The following Top 100 contains the best CD's, LP's and MC's in the world.      
 Vote for an album in this chart if you think other people should buy it too.

Announcing FireDoor, a complete solution for connecting your network            
to the Internet via a single dialup or permanent connection.

FireDoor has a full Web proxy server, with full support for HTTP, FTP

NEW GALILEO IMAGES RELEASED DAILY                                               
July 26, 1996                                                                   
                                                                                
A new Galileo image is being released on the Galileo home page every day,       
5 days a week:

The images were taken during the Ganymede encounter last month.                 
Today's Galileo image features the Galileo Regio region on Ganymede.            
                                                                                
Previously released images include a 6 image mosaic of Jupiter's                
Great Red Spot, a color image of Io, and 6 images of the Ganymede               
(Uruk Sulcus and Galileo Regio).

eye WEEKLY                                               July 25, 1996          
Toronto's arts newspaper                      .....free every Thursday          
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~          
ON DISC                                                        ON DISC          
                                                                                
                            THE BLUE NILE                                       
                            Peace At Last                                       
                         Warner Bros./Warner                                    
                                                                                
                                  by                                            
                            JASON ANDERSON                                      
                                                                                
The second album came six years after the first. Peace At Last comes            
seven years after that. I thought that Glaswegian group The Blue Nile           
regarded pop music as something of a second career, but a recent                
feature in Mojo revealed that the trio -- or at least singer Paul               
Buchanan -- are obsessives rather than dilettantes, sleeping on floors          
in the name of art and whatnot, accepting the true artist's lot of              
poverty.                                                                        
                                                                                
Peace At Last tells of struggle -- sore backs, the end of the affair            
and Christmases spent boozing and far from home. Musically, it also             
tells of the mid-'80s -- displaced funk guitar riffs, vocal bravado             
and the kind of synthesizer beds you find in four-star hotels. But              
those who dismiss The Blue Nile as an anachronism just make room for            
music that has none of their warmth or humanity. And that's a sad, sad          
thing. Did I mention it was a sad thing?                                        
                                                                                
"Now that I've found peace at last, tell me, Jesus, will it last?"              
Much of Peace At Last finds Buchanan interested in imagery similar to           
1984's A Walk Across The Rooftops and 1989's equally glorious Hats --           
"lovers walking on a highway," streetlights, marriage proposals, the            
night sky. "Sentimental Man" features The Blue Nile in full plumage,            
much like Hats' "The Downtown Lights," which was covered by both Rod            
Stewart and Annie Lennox and was last seen in a Volvo. The rest of the          
album is considerably more sombre, preoccupied as it is with the real           
costs of loving, last stands against loneliness. The way that Buchanan          
sings "love will be enough" in "Body And Soul" suggests that he only            
half-believes it. In song after song, he desperately tries to keep              
hold of the perfect moments. That peace is always so fragile. And as            
the title belies, love is a Benatarian battlefield even when you                
thought the first few tries had taught you something.                           
                                                                                
On the other hand, "Holy Love" does rather sound like Ray Parker Jr.,           
and "War Is Love" (only three songs have "love" in the title, in case           
you were asking) is overwrought, even for them. Peace At Last isn't             
perfect but the group's unabashed sentimentality -- with despair as             
the donut and love as the hole -- is a salve in a time when 98 per              
cent of pop doesn't make me feel anything. So don't wait until the              
next century to discover them.

Great for Breakfast, Brunch, or Supper                                          
I suggest a double boiler for white sauce or coated skillet.                    
                                                                                
Medium White Sauce                                                              
                                                                                
4 tablespoons butter                                                            
4 tablespoons flour                                                             
1 teaspoon salt                                                                 
1 teaspoon sugar                                                                
1/4 teaspoon black pepper or white                                              
2 cups milk  (warm before adding to flour mixture)                              
                                                                                
Melt butter over low heat; add flour, salt, pepper, sugar, stir until           
blended remove from heat. Gradually stir in warm milk and return to heat.       
Cook stirring constantly until thick and smooth.  Makes 2 cups                  
                                                                                
add six hard boiled eggs using only the whites of the egg to the white          
sauce, pour over buttered toast.  Grate yolks sprinkle over top of white        
sauce.  Serve with crisp bacon or sausage.                                      
                                                                                
Hope you like it.  Please let me here from you Granny@usit.net

Newman's Trombone is a mail filtering program. It filters messages              
without wasting time on downloading the messages, and uses rules and            
manual selection of messages to delete. This feature is required on             
several occasions. For Example:                                                 
                                                                                
        Save communication time in downloading unwanted messages.               
                                                                                
        If you have subscribed to a distribution list, and when you want

Newman's Trombone works as an alley and not as an enemy. It does not            
replace your favourite mail program but cooperate with it. You do not           
have to abandon your mail program, including its messages, folders and          
settings. In fact, Newman's Trombone lets you save resources by using a         
"light" program and running your mail program only when new messages            
come.                                                                           
                                                                                
Newmans Trombone is a shareware project. Price 25$.

                            JASON ANDERSON                                      
                                                                                
I play with the cat while I listen to A Tribe Called Quest. My                  
girlfriend says the cat -- named Z, with the Canadian pronunciation --          
is "confused and bored" so now I spend all my time at home throwing             
little Nerf balls over her head. So Z at least isn't "bored."                   
                                                                                
Once A Tribe Called Quest have vanquished all pretenders on "Phony              
Rappers," there's nothing too hectic on Beats, Rhymes And Life to               
disturb the domestic flow, no "Scenario," no "Bonita Applebum" ("Hey!"          
I'll get to brag in 10 years, "I got that track on cassette!"). Going           
by the bpms, Tribe might as well have spent the three years since               
Midnight Marauders taking long lunches. Tracks bounce down the stairs,          
cats look up, New York's crime rate continues to dip. Beats, Rhymes             
And Life is mild but sincere, the rapping nimble, not mumbled (and              
that's what I've always liked about A Tribe Called Quest -- they rap            
to the bass lines, not just the beats).                                         
                                                                                
The single "1nce Again" is great, the got-nothing-against-the-West-             
Coast track "Keeping It Moving" rides a catchy guitar lick and                  
"Stressed Out" with femme fatale Faith Evans is the closest they've             
come to R&B pop, with a synth backdrop and Evans' lushed-out vocals in          
contrast with the group's tales of high anxiety -- it's somewhere               
between "I Say A Little Prayer" and Kris Kross' "I Missed Da Bus," but          
that last citation kinda proves that my tastes in hip-hop tend toward           
novelty songs about public transportation, toilets and telephones.              
                                                                                
Hence my love for "Standing Outside A Broken Phone" by Primitive Radio          
Gods, a moniker for former air traffic controller Chris O'Connor (not           
our Chris O'Connor, but the resemblance is strong enough to suggest a           
sinister double life). ('Specially cuz this other CO'C smokes. -- ed.)          
A drum machine shuffle, a B.B. King sample, some faraway piano, a               
guitar squall and ramblings on romantic troubles that have O'Connor             
stressed out add up to the best pseudo-hip-hop hit since "Loser."               
Besides the Tears For Fears-sized "Skin Turns Blue," nothing else on            
Rocket matches its elegance. O'Connor applies a wider variety of                
sounds and styles than alt-rockers usually bother with -- Z and I both          
react badly to Sebadoh's militance in playing the same song over and            
over on their forthcoming elpee -- but the rest smacks of overkill:             
some noisy tries at techno-rock (the Jesus Jones kind), a bitchy song           
about how evil the record business is and plenty of cute samples.               
                                                                                
And as A Tribe Called Quest realized a long time ago, parental                  
advisory stickers don't make you the man (cue the PRGs' oh-so-risque            
"Motherfucker"). Repeatedly beaning a housecat with Nerf balls might.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                                                             
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News                      
Number 282  August 2, 1996  by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein                  
                                                                                
LASER LIGHT CAN COOL PARTICLE BEAMS IN 3                                        
DIMENSIONS.  In accelerators, it is usually desirable for a beam                
to be carefully controlled.  That is, one generally wants all the               
particles  to travel down the beam pipe with the same longitudinal              
velocity and very little motion perpendicular to the beam axis.                 
"Cooling" the beam---getting rid of unwanted motion---can be                    
achieved by injecting a co-moving stream of electrons, which                    
interact with and absorb excess energy in the beam particles.                   
Proton-antiproton collision experiments at CERN and Fermilab                    
depend on cooling techniques which allows swarms of unruly                      
antiprotons, created by smashing protons into a small target, to be             
gathered into tidy bunches.  Laser light can also be used to soak up            
unwanted motion.  In atom traps lasers have cooled populations of               
atoms to within a fraction of a kelvin. At accelerators so far, lasers          
have only succeeded in cooling longitudinal motion.  Now a group                
of scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in                
Heidelberg, Germany has used lasers to indirectly cool transverse               
motions as well through laser-induced intrabeam interactions among              
7-MeV beryllium ions circulating around the Heidelberg Test                     
Storage Ring.  The effectiveness of the process can be characterized            
by specifying an equivalent temperature for the beam particles.                 
Thus the starting longitudinal and transverse "temperatures" for the            
ions are 1500 and 15,000 K, respectively. Electron cooling reduces              
these values to 300 and 3500 K.  The result with lasers is even                 
better: 10 and 2500 K. Recently, still lower temperatures have been             
obtained.  The laser cooling process will only be pertinent for                 
certain species, but this may still allow for studying novel                    
phenomena. For example, team leader Rudolf Grimm                                
(grimm@mickey.mpi-hd.mpg.de) says that it may soon be possible                  
to cool a beam to such an extent that it "liquefies."  (H.-J. Miesner           
et al., Physical Review Letters, 22 July 1996.)                                 
                                                                                
DAYS WERE ONLY 18 HOURS LONG back in the Proterozoic                            
era, some 900 million years ago.  Charles Sonett of the University              
of Arizona has studied records of ancient tidal deposits preserved in           
rock strata.  Like tree rings, the periodicity of tidal sediments, or           
tidalites, provide an accounting of ancient times.  Sonett's data,              
collected in Utah, Indiana, Alabama, and Australia, shows that long             
ago the day was shorter, the year longer, and the moon much                     
closer.  Indeed, as the moon recedes from the Earth (at a rate of 3.8           
cm/year) it continues to slow Earth's rotation, thus extending the              
day further.  (C.P. Sonett et al., Nature, 5 July.)                             
                                                                                
MICROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS (MEMS) are devices small                                
enough to fit onto a chip. Essentially built with the same                      
lithographic techniques and made from the same semiconductors as                
other microchips, MEMS fall into two main categories---actuators                
and sensors. Sensor applications include the use of MEMS as                     
accelerometers for triggering (by detecting the movement of  tiny               
silicon bars on a 3-mm chip) automobile airbags and for measuring               
blood pressure (using the relative deformation of a 10-micron                   
diaphragm). Mechanical MEMS include micromotors, flaps, and                     
minute steerable mirrors for switching light pulses. Some problems              
persist (micromotors wear out quickly) but the market for MEMS                  
is expected to be worth billions of dollars by the year 2000. (New              
Scientist, 29 June.)                                                            
                                                                                
PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE will now adjourn for three weeks as                         
the authors go on the road, one to Oregon, the other to Bavaria.

Notification Server                                                             
             For Your Application, Tool or Web Site                             
                     (Windows NT, Windows 95)                                   
                   http://www.teleport.com/~otwc                                
                                                                                
Notification Server provides any application with the ability to send           
Alphanumeric Pages and EMail to Operators (i.e., any person).  Notification     
events are written by your application using the provided OLE DLL.              
Any programming language that can use an OLE DLL can use Notification Server    
(e.g., Visual Basic, Visual Basic Script, VC++, Access, Delphi,                 
Powerbuilder). When you write a notification event, an Alert List is            
specified along with the text to send as the notification.  The Alert List      
consists of any number of Operators. The product has two main components: the   
Administrator and the Server. The Administrator provides a graphical user       
interface for managing Operators, Alerts, EMail setup, Paging setup, etc. The   
Notification Server (NS) processes all the notification events written to the   
Notification Server database.  The NS processes the notification requests in    
the background so that your application and users don't wait for its            
processing.  The NS can run on the same computer as your application or it      
can be placed on any Windows NT/95 computer on your network.                    
                                                                                
This product is intended to be used by webmasters, system programmers,          
application programmers, and application administrators who want to easily      
add Notification capabilities to their websites, applications, tools.

Met with a bunch of old friends at a class reunion last weekend and             
discovered that I am at that two-baby stage of life. To a one, my               
fellow graduates have two children each. I'm still stupefied: my only           
claim to maternal instinct is a dog who pretends not to know me when            
we go to the park. This, I realize, would be why my mother no longer            
laughs at jokes about turkey basters.                                           
                                                                                
Jokes about said kitchen utensil are but one of the things you'll               
eavesdrop on in Henry Jaglom's Babyfever. Jaglom, who's wooed many a            
female filmgoer with his insightful and realistic portrayals of                 
women's lives, has ever refuted the phrase "actions speak louder than           
words." Dense with dialogue, his films are about the things people do           
when they're just being themselves. In Jaglom's world, people talk.             
                                                                                
Like his art-house success Eating, this film takes place at a women-            
only party. However, this Jaglom talkfest is not about dessert. It's            
the rug rat, that wee entity whose existence has been threatened by             
the advent of the career woman. Of course, even in the human jungle,            
it's not over 'til the fat lady sings and in this movie, the fat lady           
is pregnant. Set at a Malibu baby shower, Babyfever sees a chorus of            
31 women speak candidly about children, unstable partnerships and the           
spectre of the atrophied ovary.                                                 
                                                                                
On the one hand, the film is a minor miracle, due mainly to Jaglom's            
loose direction: the dialogue is spontaneous and poignantly honest,             
the acting is natural, the detail consummate. But all you                       
thirtysomethings, be prepared -- Babyfever is also a perfectly ghastly          
trick. It made me own up to the horrible truth that I have the                  
potential within to become a biological time bomb. It could do the              
same to you.                                                                    
                                                                                
Oh ma, there may be grandchildren yet.

McAfee Anti-Virus Researchers to Work Through the Night to Make                 
Detector Available to Public                                                    
                                                                                
SANTA CLARA, CALIF. (July 24, 1996) -- McAfee (Nasdaq: MCAF), the world's       
leading vendor of anti-virus software, today announced that McAfee's virus      
researchers have discovered the first Macro virus capable of infecting          
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  The virus, called ExcelMacro/Laroux, was         
discovered in the wild at two large multinational companies, one in Alaska      
and one in Africa.  According to McAfee virus researchers, the virus can        
replicate rapidly under normal spreadsheet use but not does not appear to       
damage data.                                                                    
                                                                                
Microsoft Excel is the world's most popular spreadsheet application.            
                                                                                
    "The Laroux virus does not appear to be widespread at this time,            
although additional infection reports are likely as computer users learn        
how to detect the virus," said Bill Larson, McAfee's president, chairman,       
and CEO.  "As with any new virus, computer users should remain vigilant         
but not panic.  By taking some simple no-cost or low-cost preventative          
measures, computer viruses are easily preventable."                             
                                                                                
How Laroux Works                                                                
                                                                                
    Laroux infects versions 5 and 7 of the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet          
application.  Desktop operating systems affected include Windows 3.x,           
Windows 95, and Windows NT.  The virus does not appear to infect Macintoshes.   
    The virus consists of two macro files, including "auto_open" and            
"check_files," and one hidden Excel worksheet named "Laroux."  Microsoft        
Excel users can easily determine if they are infected by choosing the the       
Tools/Macro option.  If the the file names "auto_open" and "check_files"        
appear, the computer is infected.                                               
    The infection spreads from one computer user to another when a Laroux-      
infected worksheet is shared and opened by another user.  The infected          
file can be spread via email attachments, floppy disks, and files exchanged     
over a corporate networks and Intranets.                                        
                                                                                
Excel Macro Virus Discovery Follows Word Macro Virus Epidemic                   
                                                                                
    The discovery of the Laroux virus follows the discovery last Fall of        
the Winword Concept virus, which was the first Macro virus to infect Microsoft  
Word documents on Windows 3.x, Windows 95, Windows NT, and the Macintosh.       
Within months of its discovery, the Concept virus became the most commonly      
reported virus according to study conducted by the National Computer Security   
Association, based in Carlisle, PA.  The virus remains the most commonly        
reported virus today, and it is especially prevalent in document-centric        
organizations who make heavy use of email.  There are now approximately 30      
known variant strains of Word Macro viruses.                                    
                                                                                
McAfee Anti-Virus Researchers Work Through the Night to Develop Cure            
                                                                                
    McAfee's anti-virus researchers and software developers plan to work        
through the night tonight to develop a Laroux detector for incorporation        
into its best-selling VirusScan anti-virus software.  Consistent with the       
Company's long-standing policy of distributing software on the honor system,    
McAfee will post free working evaluation versions of the detector on its Web    
site tomorrow as a public service.  McAfee will also launch a Laroux-specific   
support forum on its Web page containing threaded discussion groups and         
detailed technical documents about the virus.                                   
                                                                                
    VirusScan can be downloaded from McAfee forums on several leading           
online services, including America Online (keyword: MCAFEE), CompuServe (GO     
MCAFEE), The Microsoft Network (GO MCAFEE), and via McAfee's HomeBase bulletin  
board system at (408) 988-4004.  VirusScan is also available from leading       
retailers nationwide at an estimated street price of $49.00.                    
                                                                                
McAfee World's Leading Vendor of Anti-Virus Solutions                           
                                                                                
    According to IDC, McAfee is the leading vendor of anti-virus software,      
with a worldwide unit market share of 68% for standalone DOS and Windows PC     
desktops.  As the world's leading vendor of anti-virus software, McAfee is      
considered the computer industry's Center for Disease Control.  McAfee          
anti-virus products are currently used and trusted by over 20 million computer  
users worldwide.  By having more users than any other anti-virus software       
vendor, McAfee is often the first to discover emerging virus threats such       
as the Laroux macro.                                                            
                                                                                
    With nearly 1,000 suspect virus infections submitted to McAfee              
anti- virus researchers each month, the company typically discovers             
between 100 and 200 new viruses.  The company leverages its unique              
presence on the Internet to release monthly updates to customers.

NASA BRIEFING ON DISCOVERY OF POSSIBLE EARLY MARTIAN LIFE                       
                                                                                
A team of NASA and Stanford scientists discussed its findings showing strong    
circumstantial evidence of possible early Martian life, including               
microfossil remains found in a Martian meteorite, at a news conference at       
1:00 p.m. EDT, August 7, at NASA Headquarters, 300 E. St. SW, Washington,       
DC. The team's findings will be published in the August 16 issue of Science     
magazine.

I'd like to welcome everyone here today. It's an unbelievable day, its very,    
very exciting for me, and I hope you feel the same excitement that I feel.      
First I want to congratulate the team members who brought these exciting        
results to the American public and the people of the world: Dr. McKay, Dr.      
Gibson, Miss Thomas-Keprta, Dr. Zare, and Mr. Valley, thank you all. I'm so     
proud of you, words can't describe it. I'd also like to introduce a numbers     
of the memberships of the leadership of NASA science. We have Dr. Neil Lane,    
the head of the National Science Foundation with us; Dr. Bruce Alberts, the     
head of the National Academy of Sciences; Dr. Snow, of the National             
Institutes of Health, representing Dr. Harold Varmis, who couldn't be with      
us today; and we have Dr. Jerry Soften, the scientist from the Viking           
mission, upon whose shoulders we all stand today. There are other scientists    
in the audience, and I'm sure you'll have a chance to talk to them later.       
Their dedication, knowledge, and painstaking research have brought us to a      
day that may well go down in history for American science, for the American     
people, and indeed, humanity.                                                   
                                                                                
First, the results today are not conclusive, or there is not yet scientific     
consensus. We are not hereto establish as in a courtroom, beyond a shadow of    
a doubt, that life existed on Mars. But we are here today, to open the door,    
just a little bit, to provide exciting scientific findings, to tell us          
fascinating detective stories, and to lay out compelling clues that lead us     
the direction we think life might have existed at some point on Mars            
                                                                                
As a scientist and engineer, and all of us, are skeptical but thrilled and      
humbled by this prospect. As a small boy, my father took me to the Hayden       
planetarium in New York City. And I'll never forget that first view of the      
heavens that was interpreted to me. And last night, I called my father in       
Florida, who isn't feeling too well lately. And when I told him what was        
about to happen today, I could hear the vibrancy in his voice. And if this      
meeting did anything, it helped my father feel better.                          
                                                                                
We are now on a doorstep to the heavens. What a time to be alive. In the        
last year we've discovered planets around nearby stars, we've probed to the     
depths of the universe, to see the formation and birth of galaxies. And         
today, we are on the threshold of establishing, is life unique to planet        
earth. I want to tell you it is privilege to lead this great agency and the     
wonderful people, and I thank the President of the United States for giving     
me this opportunity. And I really want to thank the people here for the work    
that they have done. And we may see the first evidence that life might have     
existed beyond the confines of this small planet, the third rock from the       
sun.                                                                            
                                                                                
That could be a breathtaking conclusion, and I know the possibility of this     
took my breath away when I was with these scientists for two and a half         
hours; I gave them an unbelievable quiz personally, last week. In a few         
moments you'll hear the detective story. The scientists again are not here      
to say they found ultimate proof, or evidence -- but the evidence they          
present will be exciting-- but a chain of circumstantial events. And to         
man's further scientific investigation, we must investigate, evaluate,          
validate this discovery. And it is certain to create lively scientific          
debate and controversy to which the administrator says, outstanding, that's     
what makes American science and world science great -- peer review. We want     
this to go through time and time again; we have skeptical optimism, and we      
hope to force to further research. And in fact today we invited Dr. William     
Schopf of UCLA, an eminent scientist in the field that is not part of this      
team, that doesn't share all the views of this team, to get a                   
point-counterpoint on the day we opened the door.                               
                                                                                
We want these results investigated, and we are prepared to make samples of      
the rock available to meritorious proposals that go through the scientific      
process. We want to take the time to do this, and if it takes a year or two     
years, so be it. If the scientists tell us we have to restructure our           
program to get additional evidence, we will do it, but we will be government    
by scientific thought and principles, and not by emotion.                       
                                                                                
The president asked me to make sure the discovery is subjected to the           
methodical process. He also announced that the Vice President will call a       
space summit in November to address the over arching questions, and how this    
finding should be addressed, and all the other issues of the nation's space     
program, in the context of science, and the quest for knowledge and             
enriching life here on the planet. And finally, he repeated the commitment      
to an aggressive plan already in place for the robotic exploration of Mars.     
I want to thank the president for his unwavering support of the nation's        
space program, his vision and his leadership. He asked us to do something       
hard: he didn't say let's give you extra money; he held NASA accountable to     
reshape our program within a tighter budget, and I think, with his              
leadership, we have been.                                                       
                                                                                
I want to thank the Congress for the consistent bipartisan support of this      
program. And yesterday I had the privilege of talking to the Congressional      
leadership to tell them what might happen today, and some of the members        
were almost childlike in their excitement about the possibilities, and very     
humbled about what they heard. And today I spoke to the world space             
leadership, and there's an unbelievable excitement around the world about       
the possibilities -- I invited the world space leadership to work with us,      
to see if this is really the case.                                              
                                                                                
We're going to develop a process -- and I've asked Wes Huntress to provide      
the leadership --we're going to be concerned about how we take spacecraft to    
Mars, and not contaminate the samples there. We are going to be concerned       
about that contamination if we return samples to Earth. But we will be          
driven by a scientific process and not a rush to go to Mars. We will not do     
anything irresponsible. As you know, NASA's working on an origins program.      
We are asking fundamental questions about how did galaxies, stars, solar        
systems, planets and planetary bodies form and evolve, and is life unique --    
life, however low, carbon-based or not, is it unique to this planet.            
                                                                                
We have a program that seeks to send an armada of small spacecraft to Mars      
and other planets in our solar system. There are over 10 spacecraft on the      
books right now, and in the next decade, within ten to 15 years, it is our      
objective to be able to directly detect earth-sized planets if they exist       
around stars within 50 to a hundred light years of earth, and to be able to     
remotely sense their environment to see what the makeup is, to see if           
there's oxygen and water vapor, and carbon dioxide, and perhaps even            
methane, so we can reach out even further. It's a bold, exciting program,       
and I know we'll have some knowledge, but I can't guarantee results.            
                                                                                
But now, let's move today's exciting story, a detective story. The              
scientists will lay out for you how an ancient rock, found its way from Mars    
and it got to earth, after billions of years, to have this rock, tell the       
people of American and the world an amazing story.                              
                                                                                
Dr. Huntress?                                                                   
                                                                                
HUNTRESS: Thank you very much Dan. I know you are all anxious to get right      
down to it, so my privilege this morning is really to introduce the team,       
and to let them kind of tell you their story. I mean, this is the result of     
over 2 1/2 years of very intensive, meticulous and difficult detective work     
on this particular meteorite, and most of what you are going to hear today      
has been peer-reviewed by the scientific community, and will appear in one      
of this nation's most science publications, Science Magazine, but we are        
also going to give you some new results, that have come out just recently,      
as well. So if I could introduce the team: first, the team leader is Dave       
McCay, to my immediate left, from the Johnson Space Center, he is a             
geochemist with over 27 years of work, in -- particularly with lunar sample     
investigation. Next to him Everett Gibson, also of Johnson. He is also a        
geochemist with over 20 years of investigations in geochemistry and lunar       
sample work.                                                                    
                                                                                
Next to Everett is Kathy Thomas-Keprta, she's also from JSC, and she's been     
studying meteorites and lunar samples with transmission electron microscopy,    
for about 12 years. Next to Kathy is profession Richard Zare, he's professor    
of Chemistry at Stanford University. He's also chairman of the National         
Science Board of the National Science Foundation; an expert in laser            
analysis -- this is a guy who can detect single molecules.                      
                                                                                
Next to him is Bill Schopf, he's professor of paleobiology at UCLA. He's the    
discoverer of fossil evidence for the oldest life on this planet. He's not a    
member of the investigative team, as Dan told you, but he's here as an          
independent investigator to provide a balancing view on the data you are        
about to see.                                                                   
                                                                                
Next to bill is Professor Hojitola Valley from McGill University in             
Montreal, one of the members of the investigative team. And we have two         
investigators, also in the audience over here, on the left, Dr. Simon           
Clement of Stanford University's department of Chemistry, and Dr. Chris         
Romanek of the University of Georgia.                                           
                                                                                
And so at this point, I would like to turn it over to Dave McKay.               
                                                                                
MCKAY: Thank you, Wes. What I would like to do this afternoon is lead you       
through our story, which is a bit of a detective story, on why we think we      
have found evidence for past life on Mars. Now I want to warn you, that this    
is a controversial story, and there'll be a lot of disagreement, but the        
team itself has spent two and a half years with this sample, and we're in       
consensus view that we're along -- going along the right track.                 
                                                                                
What we've dealt with here is a single rock, and you can see a piece of this    
rock in front of me, and the first slide is on your screen, showing a           
picture of the rock, or will be on your screen soon, but this rock came from    
Mars, we argue, it was found in Antarctica, it was brought back to Houston,     
and some of it to the Smithsonian -- this happens to be the Smithsonian         
chunk, which is 170 grams-- the total rock is about 4 and a half pounds, 1.9    
kilograms, and is about the size of a small potato. We couldn't bring the       
part that was in Houston, but this is a very good sample of the actual rock     
that we analyzed.                                                               
                                                                                
What I'm going to do, what our team is going to do is look at our data, and     
our data has 4 different lines of evidence, and these lines of evidence --      
each one of these lines of evidence can be interpreted in various ways.         
However, we think that a reasonable interpretation for each one of these is     
that the evidence is pointing toward biologic activity in early Mars, and       
we'll tell you why.                                                             
                                                                                
The lines of evidence that we'll develop are that, first, the meteorite came    
from Mars, and contains carbonate -- calcium carbonate, the same thing as       
found in limestone -- which was formed on Mars, and it is within and            
associated with this calcium carbonate, that we see much of our evidence.       
The mineralogy and the chemistry of the carbonate globules, we call them, we    
believe are compatible with a biologic origin.                                  
                                                                                
That's our second line of evidence. The third line of evidence is that the      
rock contains organic compounds, organic material, which we believe comes       
from Mars, and we'll talk about that.                                           
                                                                                
And our last bit of evidence, are pictures of strange structures within this    
rock, within the carbonate, some of which we have interpreted as                
micro-fossil forms, micro-fossil-like forms, and we'll show you those. This     
is perhaps the most controversial part of our presentation, but we'll show      
you those anyway.                                                               
                                                                                
Now, as I said, there are alternative explanations for each of the lines of     
evidence that we see, but taken it -- when you look at them individually        
there are alternative explanations, but when you look at them all together,     
collectively, particularly in view that they all occur within a very small      
volume-- every sand-sized chip has most of these kinds of evidence in it --     
we conclude that taken together, this is evidence for early life on Mars,       
and we'll tell you why. Now I want to turn the discussion over to Dr.           
Everett Gibson, who will show an overview of our story, its an animation,       
and he will walk through it and tell you what it means. This is an              
interpretation based on our data.                                               
                                                                                
GIBSON: Thank you David. Let me explain to you a little bit of what you're      
going to see. We have placed -- put together two and a half to three minutes    
of animation on the history of this sample. We feel this will assist you in     
understanding the evolution of this sample, the materials we are studying,      
and what we are looking at in particular. This information was gathered from    
a variety of colleagues, through the communities who made specific              
measurements, but we feel it all points to the important story that we are      
here to tell. If I can have the animation, we'll go through this.               
                                                                                
Early in the history of the inner solar system, we knew the planets were        
solidifying in this period of time of 4 1/2 billion years ago. The sample       
which we have before us is 4 1/2 billion years in age. It appeared about 4      
billion years, the inner solar system bodies were undergoing an intense         
bombardment, and the surface of Mars was no exception, it underwent this        
intense bombardment. And 4 billion years ago, we knew the surface was           
fractured, the planet was probably warmer and wetter. Water was more            
abundant, it filled these cracks and fractures, and as time evolved, we feel    
that the solutions may have resulted in the formation of these carbonate        
globules which we see within these fractures in this meteorite. And as these    
carbonate globules were growing, there was probably a presence of a             
microbiota?, what it exactly is, we do not know, but we see the forms which     
you'll see later today. And as these carbonates grew from these solutions       
and filled these fractures and voids in this sample, they begin to entrain      
these organisms which you'll see in the photography shown later,. So these      
carbonates were present on the surface of Mars and growing. We know this        
from the actual topic chemistry from these materials.                           
                                                                                
Then Mars went through a period when it became older and drier, and so up       
and from the 3.6 billion years age of the carbonates up to the interval of      
16 million years ago, we know a large object slammed into the surface of        
mars, knocked material from the surface. This material traveled through         
space for 16 million years. Thirteen thousand years ago, it came under the      
influence of Earth's gravity, and fell on the Antarctic ice sheet. It was       
lying on the Antarctic ice sheet, it was resided there for 13,000 years. A      
joint national science foundation field meteorite collecting program, which     
was supported by NASA and the Smithsonian Institution, this material was        
collected by the field team, and brought back to the Johnson Space Center,      
where it was cleaned and processed. You see the sample with the dark fusion?    
crust, which is the blighted surface as it came through the Earth's             
atmosphere, and you look in the interior and see the orthoperixine?             
minerals. And highlighted, we see an area of weathering and alteration, and     
then we look into theses mall cracks above, you see another area where we       
have these orange-brown globules. They are in the highlighted area in this      
film. To understand and see these a little better, we're showing an image       
from our colleague Monica Grady of the British Museum. And you see these 250    
micron-sized carbonate globules with their black and white rims. These are      
approximately five times the diameter of a human hair. They are very small      
in size, but they are very unusual to be in a meteorite. And the study of       
these, and the chemistry that's going on in these rims of these globules, is    
basically the story which we have today, to tell you.                           
                                                                                
I'd like to pass the microphone to my colleague Kathy Thomas-Keprta, and        
she'll explain the chemistry.                                                   
                                                                                
KEPRTA: Hi, if I could have the first slide please. What we're going to         
concentrate on now is taking a closer look at these carbonate globules that     
Everett just described. Now this is a cartoon, on your video, if you could      
back it up one please. Back up one slide please. Back to the cartoon. We'll     
have it for you in a moment. There we are. And what you're seeing -- what       
Everett just showed you, he showed you the golden-colored carbonate             
globules. What we're looking at here is just an edge of one of the              
carbonates, in cartoon form. And you can see, as you saw in the previous        
picture, these globules contain black-white-black rims. We've been calling      
them our Oreo cookie rims. Anyway, as you approach the rim, if you see the      
tiny dark spots, the rims are composed of very fine grain minerals. One of      
the minerals is called magnetite, and its composed only of iron and oxygen.     
The other one is composed of puritite, which is composed only of iron and       
sulfur. That's located in the rim area. Now in another area away from the       
rim, within the carbonate, we get a closer look at another region, which        
shows more smaller grains, the Magnetite, again, present -- its composed of     
iron and oxygen -- and supposed gregite, that is composed of iron and           
sulfur. Now, these particles, these metal grains are very, very tiny. And so    
what we had to use to image these is a transmission electron microscope, and    
we'll call that from now on a TEM. And we can take a very small area with       
the magnetite and puritite and zoom in on that. Next slide.                     
                                                                                
.. Dark splotchy regions are magnetite. Now let's get a closer look at the      
magnetite. Next slide. These magnetite -- you can see one has a cubeoid         
shape, the other is in a teardrop shape -- these magnetite are roughly about    
40 to 50 nanometers wide. You can fit about a billion of these on the head      
of a pin, that's how small they are. So -- and they have a very unique          
shapes. Next slide.                                                             
                                                                                
Now to determine -- we can actually determine, based on the literature,         
based on three criteria, if this magnetite that we are seeing is biogenic or    
not -- whether it has been produced by bacteria --based on the distinctive      
shape, based on the chemistry and based on the environment. Now these shapes    
-- next slide -- these shapes are very similar to magnetite that's produced     
from bacteria on the Earth. They are also very similar in size, they are the    
exact same composition, they have a very pure crystal structure, there are      
no defects, and both types of magnetite that are produced by microorganisms     
on the earth, and that that we find on mars, have been produced in a            
low-temperature, fluid environment. Next slide.                                 
                                                                                
And these are magneto fossils found on earth, and as you can see, we can        
compare the shapes to what we saw previously. The one on the top left is a      
cubeoid shape, and the one on the bottom right is a teardrop shape -- just      
exactly what we had seen from our Martian images. Next slide.                   
                                                                                
We can also take a closer look at some of the iron sulfides. The two images     
that you see on the left are rectangular, probable gregite particles from       
our Martial sample. The sample on the right is a terrestrial sample. Now        
these gregite samples -- the gregite sulfides, are -- they're very similar      
to what we see on earth as far as chemistry, as far as the shape, the           
surface morphology, and it is very common on earth for gregite to be            
produced by bacteria. Next slide.                                               
                                                                                
Last we'll take a look at the puretite, which was also associated with the      
magnetite. And again you can see two different types of shapes for the          
puritite. This type of puritite, which again is an iron sulfite, can be         
produced inorganically. However, it can also be produced by certain types of    
microorganisms on earth.                                                        
                                                                                
In summary, we feel that even though there could be very complicated            
inorganic explanations for the presence of these mineral grains, the            
simplest explanation is that these are products from microorganisms that        
were produced on Mars. And now I will hand you off to Dr. Richard Zare, who     
will discuss the organic chemistry.                                             
                                                                                
RICHARD ZARE: Thank you Kathy. Organic chemistry: by this I mean molecules      
that contain carbon. The Viking lander mission, two of them, went, looked,      
scooped up the surface of mars, looked with a mass spectrometer, and really     
came up a little empty handed, didn't really find the organics that one         
might have hoped to find. And there's been increasingly a feeling that grew,    
that somehow the planet was all dead. We can return later to examine that       
conclusion. What we've done is take pieces, fractures from this meteorite,      
and pop them in a high vacuum system. We then shine in a laser, a bunch of      
laser systems -- pardon me? No audio. Let's try another, thank you.             
                                                                                
So let me start again. We take these pieces of the meteorite sample, freshly    
cleaved, put them into our vacuum system in less than two minutes, high         
vacuum system, and analyze what type of organic molecules they have. We do      
this in a method that I will show you later, and if I might have the first      
slide, let me show you the results. We find certain types of hydrocarbons,      
things that contain carbon and hydrogen, this shows some peaks, these are       
so-called, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -- Pasha. PAHs are really a         
pretty common substance on earth. It's found, for example, in diesel            
exhaust, or in sooting of a flame, or it's found when you overcook steak on     
the barbecue, or it's found in such things as when you fossilize various        
organic matter, like in petroleum products and such. The PAHs can also be       
made in a purely inorganic manner, for example by somehow polymerizing          
acetylene. So finding PAHs in themselves doesn't tell you whether something     
is alive or dead -- not in itself. The particular figure, though, that we       
have, if I could come back to showing you that slide, is unusual compared to    
other carbonaceous chondrites-- we've looked at other meteorites that have      
PAHs -- this distribution is much simpler, and I could go on and explain in     
some detail how it's much simpler -- it very much resembles what you'd          
expect when you have simple organic matter decay. We have indeed studied        
these PAHs and we've done them as a function of depth from the fusion crust     
inside the rock, we find them more inside of the rock than in the fusion        
crust. We believe that means that they're indigenous, they belong to the        
rock. If they came from a contamination -- if they came through the rock        
while it was on earth, it would really expect to be more on the outside         
working its way in. It's completely backwards as to what we find.               
                                                                                
If I could have the next slide. I'll show you that we're also able to make a    
map, and as you look at this, you'll see in the upper right-hand corner,        
this is the A, B, C, D, and each one, you'll find what I call "hot spots" --    
this is where there's a bigger signal, that's what I mean by hot spot. And      
of these different simple PAHs, they are not only correlated with each          
other, but they are correlated with the carbonate globules which you've         
already heard about.                                                            
                                                                                
Let me now explain how the method works by asking you to take a look at the     
animation that we've prepared for this setup. This is a system that has a       
very immense sensitivity. It is able to look at only a few thousand             
molecules of material. First we have an infrared laser, which we'll turn        
off, hit the sample shown below, heat it up, and cause it to evaporate. This    
will produce a plume of gas cloud. Here we go -- there's the plume. Next the    
UV laser shines in, excites some molecules that can absorb it, produces         
ions, knocks on an electron to produce ions, and this electric field with a     
battery, they go and hit the detector. Now we move the laser around, hit        
another spot, fire it again, and we make a map, as we, indeed, make these       
ions. Notice there's two types of ions, those that are fat and those which      
are thin. It's like a race, and I'm sorry to tell you, the thin ones always     
beat the fat ones, and so by looking at the arrival time, we determine the      
weight of the molecule --that's the mass spectrum. And by this means, we've     
been able to look and see the first organic molecules that we believe come      
from Mars. Let me now turn this microphone back to Dave and hopefully we're     
going to see some pictures.                                                     
                                                                                
DAVID MCKAY: Okay, moving on, if I could have the first slide, please. This     
is simply the same picture you saw earlier of the carbonate globules with       
the black and white rims around them. This picture was provided to us by        
Monica Grady of the British National Museum, who took this very nice            
picture. Next slide please.                                                     
                                                                                
We're going to discuss now some of the features that we see in the scanning     
electron microscope, features which occur on the surface of those carbonate     
globules. This is a typical picture of an area rich in iron, it's one of the    
iron-rich rims. And we see that the scale is not on this, but the biggest       
object in this picture is about 500 nanometers across. That's roughly           
1/500th the size of a human hair. We see that the carbonate globule is          
covered in areas with this kind of very fine-grained material -- and you can    
see that there's one rod shape, there's kind of a one with a dark line up       
the center of it -- many of these are probably the magnetite iron-oxide         
crystals that we saw earlier --we're looking at them with a different           
technique now -- and many of them are probably the iron-sulfide grains that     
we saw earlier. But some of these don't look like either magnetite or iron      
sulfite -- they may be something else. And we're not quite sure what that       
is. Next slide please.                                                          
                                                                                
Again, at very high magnification in the area of the carbonate globules we      
see this kind of feature. These are elongated forms, structural forms. We       
think that matrix that they appear to be eroding out of is probably a clay      
mineral. We're confirming that, but we do have indication now that there's a    
water-containing clay mineral in this area. The features that you see may be    
any number of things; for example, they could be dried-up parts of that         
clay, or they could be microfossils from Antarctica or microfossils from        
Mars. It is our interpretation, the one that we favor, is that these are, in    
fact, microfossil forms from Mars. But keep in mind that is an                  
interpretation, we have no independent data that these are fossils, we don't    
have pictures showing cell walls, or internal material characteristic of        
cells. It's simply an interpretation at this point. Next slide, please          
                                                                                
As we look in other areas of the carbonate, we see these forms which are        
elongated, they have rounded ends on them. Are these strange crystals? Are      
they dried-up mud? We believe, we interpret that these are indeed               
microfossils from Mars. They are extremely tiny, the longest one is about       
200 nanometers, this is very high magnification. One of the techniques that     
we're using, by the way, is high-resolution scanning electron microscope.       
We're looking at rocks and minerals at a scale that has really not been used    
before. These are extremely high-magnification, high-resolution pictures.       
Next slide please.                                                              
                                                                                
Just for comparison, these are some tiny bacteria, nano- bacteria on an         
Earth rock, on calcite, calcium carbonate, the same kind of material we're      
looking at on Mars, and the scale their shows 500 nanometers. These are         
interpreted by the authors of this particular paper, which includes none of     
our team, they are interpreted to be nanobacteria. And these things are the     
same size and shape as many of the forms that we're seeing in the Mars          
sample. Next please.                                                            
                                                                                
As we move on, we see a few of these elongate forms, which appear to be         
segmented. This one is about a half a micrometer long, which is still about     
a 1/100th the diameter of a human hair, which is very tiny, but now we're       
getting up into the size range of a common terrestrial microbes and             
bacteria, and whether this is a microfossil or whether its a dried up mud       
crack, we can't really say because we have no data other than what you see,     
which is simply the photograph, but again, it is our interpretation that        
this and similar features have a high probability of being martial              
microfossils. Next, please.                                                     
                                                                                
Now, Dr. Valley of our group, and his laboratory in Canada, using a             
different technique, a totally different technique, took these pictures of      
the same rock, and he found very similar elongated, somewhat curved             
structural features, and again we don't know what these are, we don't have      
chemistry on these, but one possible interpretation is that they are similar    
kinds of Martian microfossils to what we saw in the scanning electron           
microscope. Next slide, please                                                  
                                                                                
And finally, I want to finish up with a slide of some real bacteria, that we    
know are bacteria, which turn out to be about the same size and about the       
same shape as the things that I've been showing you in the Mars sample.         
These are from the Columbia River basalts from the state of Washington, and     
they're from volcanic rocks, and they're buried deep within the ground.         
They're a couple kilometers deep, these come from a drill core, and it turns    
out that within the samples from this drill core, there are subterranean,       
subsurface bacteria, and some of them -- there are larger ones-- but some of    
them are these very small kind of bacteria.                                     
                                                                                
So in conclusion then, in terms of the photography, we have a number of         
forms, which are --which it is very tempting for us to interpret as Martian     
micro-fossils. But, we have no confirming evidence, and you'll hear more        
about the pitfalls of identifying such things based on appearance alone. We     
don't have the chemistry of these, we don't know if they have cell walls or     
not -- we will find that out, that will be part of our future work -- but       
for now we have to use these images and interpret them the best way we can.     
And so I want to finish up here by simply saying that we have these lines of    
evidence, and none of them in itself is definitive, but taken together, the     
simplest explanation to us is that they are the remains of Martian life. And    
Everett is going to sum it up in terms of a checklist of what you would look    
for if you were looking and trying to prove early Martian life.                 
                                                                                
EVERETT GIBSON: Thank you David. Very clearly, the only record we have, our     
criteria that we can use to judge our data against, is that of the own          
geologic record here on the earth. And what we have chosen to do is go into     
the literature and pull out those data points which other investigators have    
used to establish the criteria of the authenticity of microfossils here on      
the earth, they are evidence of early living systems here on the Earth.         
                                                                                
And what are they? If I could have the next slide of view graph. We have        
essentially eight criteria for establishing credible evidence of past life      
within geologic column. One: do we know the origin of the sample? Do we know    
the age of the sample? Are there presence of microfossils in this sample?       
Are there remains of potential colonies where these microfossils have begun     
to multiply or replicate? Are there biomineral markers present? Is there        
some organic material as a organic biomarker present? And then we turned to     
a technique of the stable isotope pattern, that may give us evidence,           
because we know from living systems the isotopes of carbon and other            
elements are fractionated[?], that we can use these as fingerprints to          
identify evidence of living systems. The last one is, are these features        
indigenous to the samples?                                                      
                                                                                
And lets go to the next slide, and look at our data, and review that again.     
What is the origin of the sample? We know the sample is from Mars, we feel,     
from several lines of evidence, primarily, the oxygen isotopic composition      
is unique, for materials from Mars, because the materials were formed from a    
different reservoir.                                                            
                                                                                
What is the age of the sample? Three different independent geochronometry       
techniques have determined the age of this rock as 3.5 billion years old --     
I mean, sorry, 4.5 billion years old, from the early crust of Mars. The age     
of the carbonates that are in this rock have been dated at 3.6 billion, this    
also may have a slightly younger age, but this is the age that's published,     
that we must go at.                                                             
                                                                                
Are there presence of microfossils? Yes, you've seen from the evidence          
that's presented, there are the ovoids, or the spherical objects, that down,    
in the range, of individual units. Some of these appear to be dividing, or      
they're doublets, or things of this type.                                       
                                                                                
Are there any structural remains of colonies, or perhaps these carbonate        
globules are a larger colony there.                                             
                                                                                
Are there any biomineral markers? Yes, we have the evidence, the magnetite,     
and the puritite, and possibly the gregite, which are suggestive of             
disequilibrium assemblages[?] that must be present within minerals to           
support the energy source for organisms to thrive.                              
                                                                                
Are there any organic biomarkers? The organic biomarkers we've seen from the    
organic chemistry of Dr. Zare shows that yes, there is evidence of organic      
material -- and a reduced organic material carbon material, reduced carbon      
-- within these samples from Mars.                                              
                                                                                
Are there any unique stable isotope patterns which we use here on earth,        
this is an area where clearly we need more work in, but we saw from the         
initial discovery of the unusual carbon composition of these carbonates,        
there is another story there, which we have a lot to be done in this area.      
                                                                                
And are the features indigenous to the sample? I think we can say yes, from     
what we've seen today, and the tests that we've done, these features appear     
to be indigenous to these samples.                                              
                                                                                
So from the criteria we have, we come to the conclusion that we meet a large    
number, if not all, of these criteria which we use to establish evidence of     
past life in our own terrestrial geologic column, and perhaps they can be       
applied to this material believed to be from Mars. Thank you.                   
                                                                                
DR. HUNTRESS: Okay, I think what you've seen here is a very compelling case     
for the possibility of life on early Mars, and it's been built on several       
lines of evidence: evidence involving the organic chemistry of this sample,     
mineralogical evidence, and even structural evidence of this sample and         
their close association together. I think you've also seen some pretty          
astounding imaging that is very, very suggestive of early life on Mars. The     
agency's attitude is, as Mr. Goldin suggested, and that is of skeptical         
fascination with this result, and the point is it is now time for this to       
move into the scientific community, and for the discussions to begin as to      
the conclusions that these investigators have come to as a result of having     
taken all this data, and so here to kind of represent and begin that debate,    
is Bill Schopf of UCLA.                                                         
                                                                                
BILL SCHOPF: Thank you. I would prefer to refer to my comments as part of a     
discussion rather than a debate. I would like to thank Mr. Goldin and NASA      
for inviting me to be here. I am not a member of this science team. I have      
been invited here to do a preliminary analysis, publicly, of the paper that     
is coming out in Science Magazine in about ten days. Mr. Goldin referred to     
me as the optimistic skeptic, or perhaps I'm a skeptical optimist, I really     
don't know. Could I have the first slide, please?                               
                                                                                
I do think this is a fine piece of work, and this is not easy science. This     
is multi-disciplinary science, these folks have tried to bring to bear on an    
important problem many different areas of the science, and to bring them        
into a coherent whole. I personally regard this as a preliminary report. I      
quote on this slide a quote attributed to Carl Sagan: "Extraordinary claims     
require extraordinary evidence," and I happen to regard the claim of life on    
Mars, present or past, as an extraordinary claim, and I think it is right       
for us to require extraordinary evidence in support of that claim. And so I     
guess my job here, principally, is to sound a note of caution.                  
                                                                                
If I could have the next slide, I have been involved in searching for           
ancient life on this planet for the past three decades. I wrote my first        
scientific paper in 1964, and so I have been in this game for a long time.      
And during that period of time a set of seven criteria have evolved, and        
that is, those are the criteria we use to test such claims on earth, and        
those criteria, in my opinion, must be met on Mars as well. We want to know     
the source of the material -- the age of the rock, the environment in which     
it was formed, and the history of that rock -- has it been pressure cooked,     
for example. With regard to claims of organic matter, or of fossil-like         
objects in such ancient rocks, there are three tests: one, are they within      
the rock; two, are they as old as that rock, rather than having been            
introduced somewhat later; and thirdly and most importantly, are they           
demonstrably, assuredly, certainly biological?                                  
                                                                                
Let us remember that the mere presence of organic matter by itself does not     
say it's part of life, because we know on this planet, prior to the origin      
of life, organic matter was synthesized non-biologically; we know that there    
are lots of -- there are meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites that         
contain large amounts of organic matter that is of non- biologic origin. So     
we want to know, is that organic matter demonstrably biological, and            
secondly, with regard to fossil-like objects, we'd like to know they are        
assuredly fossils, not mineralic pseudo-fossils, or what we used to call        
"foolers," things that fool you and you'd prefer they didn't.                   
                                                                                
So let me have the next slide and I'll show you the oldest evidence of life     
on this planet to give you an idea of the sort of thing that we're looking      
for elsewhere. These are microscopic fossils, 3.465 billion years in age,       
that is, nearly three and a half billion years in age -- roughly                
three-quarters the age of the earth. They are demonstrably cellular, as you     
can see, and they are composed of organic material. Their cell walls are        
made of organic matter. On the next slide, at the far upper right-hand side     
of the -- no, lets, this is another set of fossils from this deposit; they      
have conical end-cells, they have rounded end-cells[?], they have               
demonstrable cells, and all that. These are demonstrably fossils. Now, up in    
this slide at the upper-right-hand side, I want to draw your attention to a     
very minute strand. And that strand, at the upper right-hand side, is           
one-half of a micron in thickness. This is a bacterial strand, it's three       
and a half billion years in age, it comes from this Earth, and it is 100        
times larger than these microscopic objects that we have just seen from         
Mars. And that is one of the smallest, shown in the slide, one of the           
smallest fossils that has been found on Earth. Let me finish up now, by         
going to the last slide, which is a subjective confidence rating comparing      
evidence of life on Earth to evidence of life on Mars, as here presented. I     
want to emphasize this is subjective; it says "subjective"; it is italicized    
"subjective." It is my opinion. And I want to go through these seven lines      
of evidence and tell you what I think about them; I've been asked to do that    
and I'll be as honest and as rigorous as I can.                                 
                                                                                
With regard to the geology: it seems to me that it is quite probable that       
this meteorite is from Mars. We should remember that there are only 12 such     
Martian, alleged Martian meteorites known, only two of them, to my              
knowledge, contain inclusions in which there is direct evidence that they       
are like the surface chemistry of the Martian atmosphere. Nevertheless, I       
give that a confidence rating of 9. The Olympics are just over, I'm using a     
one-to-ten scale -- this is a 9.                                                
                                                                                
The age, I think, is also pretty well established, the age of these             
carbonates at about 3.6 billion, that's a little more uncertain. I give that    
a confidence rating of 8. But I think that's pretty good stuff.                 
                                                                                
Now with regard to the environment and history it is only fair to point out     
that there is a debate, scientifically, regarding such matters. There was,      
in fact, a paper published in the July issue of Nature Magazine, by Ralph       
Harvey and Harry McSween, of Case Western Reserve and the University of         
Tennessee, respectively, in which they argue that these carbonate in the        
fractures in this Martian meteorite were not formed at low temperature, that    
in fact they argue that they were formed at 450 degrees Celsius; if that is     
true, there is no expectation of these things harboring life.                   
                                                                                
Similarly, there is a question as to the time the carbonate formed within       
this rock. One argument presented here is that this was before the body was     
lifted off the Martian surface. A second interpretation in the paper I just     
referred to was that those fractures were caused during the impact that         
lifted that off the Martian surface. If Harvey and McSween were correct and     
the NASA group were to be incorrect, I think those two interpretation would     
rule out the presence of life in the sample. Let me only point out, I am not    
taking sides in this matter, I am simply saying that this is not a resolved     
issue as yet in the minds of some people.                                       
                                                                                
Finally: with regard to the organic matter and the fossil-like objects. I       
think that it has been established certainly to my satisfaction beyond any      
doubt that I have, that both the organic matter --that is, the polycyclic       
aromatic hydrocarbons[?] -- and the fossil- like structures are -- occur        
within the rocks. I think it's very likely, that even though they occur in      
fractures, where ground water can introduce things, I think the data are        
good, I give it an 8 or 9 rating that, in fact, those things are a sold as      
the fractures in that rock.                                                     
                                                                                
With regard to the biology, however, I take a rather different view. With       
regard to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, I note that such compounds      
are found in interstellar dust grains. I note that PAHs are found in            
interplanetary carbon grains. I note that PAHs are found in other sorts of      
meteorites, like carbonaceous chondrites. In none of those cases have they      
ever been interpreted as being biological. This is, after all, a meteorite,     
and so, the first approximation, I'd look at those PAHs and say, assuming       
that they're not contamination from industrial pollution on this planet, I'd    
say that the first guess would be that they're probably non-biological, just    
like PAHs that occur in other meteorites. The burden of proof is on those       
who claim that they are biological.                                             
                                                                                
And secondly, with regard to these fossil-like objects, I note that they are    
100 times smaller than such fossils that have been found on this planet. I      
note that there is no evidence of their composition. The best guess at this     
point would be that they are made of mineralic material. At least, there are    
no data -- and it's because they are so small, there are no techniques at       
present to analyze their chemical composition -- but there's no evidence        
that they're made out of carbonaceous material; we don't know that yet.         
                                                                                
Thirdly, there's no evidence that there is a cavity within them, a              
compartment, a cell. Why do you need that? Well, that is where the juices of    
a living organism reside, that's where the chemistry that makes things live     
works. We've got to look inside these things -- see if they have cell walls,    
see if they are compartmentalized, see if they are cellular, see if they are    
composed of organic material. There is no good evidence as yet of life          
cycles, or of cell division -- tests that we also apply to, in the fossil       
record. So all I am saying is that there is additional work here to be done.    
I give the biological interpretation at this point, I claim that in my          
opinion it's probably unlikely. But it's possible to do additional science,     
to answer these questions, to test this and move it up the confidence scale.    
                                                                                
I finally come back to Sagan's, Carl Sagan's quotation, which I think is        
applicable: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. We know the    
sort of evidence that we need to obtain regarding these samples. Personally     
I think that this is exciting, I think it's very interesting, I think           
they're pointing in the right direction. But I think a lot more, or a           
certain amount, of additional work needs to be done before we can have firm     
confidence that this report is of life on Mars. Thank you.                      
                                                                                
DR HUNTRESS: Well, I think you've seen that this is a result that is going      
to be very controversial. That's not a surprise to us at all. We've given       
you a kind of a taste of the scientific discussion and how this process will    
proceed. We'd like you to keep in mind that a fair amount of this has been      
peer-reviewed by the scientific community, although much more work needs to     
be done to confirm or deny this, as you just heard from Bill Schopf. But the    
agency certainly felt that it was very important to make the results of this    
work, the data, and the conclusions of these investigators, public. And so I    
now turn it over to Laurie Boeder to handle Q & A.                              
                                                                                
LAURIE BOEDER: Thank you all for your patience, we'll start with questions      
here at headquarters. Please wait for the microphone to reach you, and state    
your name and your news organizations-affiliation. Questions please? Jim.       
                                                                                
Q: Jim Slade for CNN and I guess the question is for Mr. Goldin, actually.      
Mr. Goldin, what does this augur for, where does the agency go from here,       
what kind of additional investigation must be made, and in the long-range       
planning, does it change any of your objectives over the next ten to twenty     
years?                                                                          
                                                                                
MR. GOLDIN: Issue number one: I keep coming back to the basic issue. Let us     
let the scientific process work its way through to get the validation, the      
extraordinary validation of extraordinary claims. This is the most important    
thing that must be done. We're a very open agency, and I felt rather than       
holding this back in the innards of NASA, we needed to share this with the      
American people, we need to share with the world scientific community, that     
is our first major task.                                                        
                                                                                
Secondly, I think we have to listen to the scientific community. We have a      
program of roughly two missions to Mars every launch window -- that's about     
every two years. The first set of missions comes up late this fall, November    
and December. We want the scientific community to overview those missions       
and the objectives, and see if we want to change some of the scientific         
objectives to help substantiate or refute this data. And in the discussion      
with the key scientists in this country, I believe we'll be on a path to        
doing that. One of the reasons I have asked the key scientific leadership of    
the nation to be here, I felt that it wasn't something that should be just      
within NASA, so we're going to need the help of the National Institute of       
Health, the National Academy of Science, the National Science Foundations.      
That's the second part. Third, I think we are going to have to accelerate       
some activities. One of the key areas that we have to look at is the sample     
return. Initially with robots, and then ultimately, if we have reasons to do    
it, with human beings. Right now we are on a very slow time scale to getting    
a sample return; our plan is to go in 2005, after we select an appropriate      
landing site. We want to be science-driven, so we're going to ask the           
scientific community to work with us, to get experts like you see on this       
podium and to get other people to help shape that, and in the weeks and         
months and years ahead, we will do that.                                        
                                                                                
Q: Do you foresee any of that leading to an amalgam of the world space          
agencies, coming together in order to put a mission together that would give    
you a landing and a sample return?                                              
                                                                                
MR GOLDIN: I believe that it will be a worldwide mission, and that is why I     
spoke to the leadership of the world space community today, and I invited       
them not just to plan the missions, but to help us understand the results       
that we have. We're going to work together, we're working together on the       
space station. But I don't want to jump the gun; let us have the scientists     
establish the need, and the engineers and technologists will make it happen     
-- but I'm cautiously optimistic we'll be on the right path to collect the      
data.                                                                           
                                                                                
Q: Yeah, my name is Perila Shannon, I'm from Channel 9 Eyewitness News here.    
If this is correct, if you have found microscopic life once existed on Mars,    
what does that do to your speculation about whether we're alone in the          
universe.                                                                       
                                                                                
A: Let me try that. If in fact this result is confirmed, or we get some         
consensus in the science community that the probability is very high that       
these things actually do represent microfossils on Mars, then what it means,    
first of all, that life originated on a planet other than our own, in our       
own solar system, early in its history. In fact, we're finding on our own       
planet, that wherever we look where there's a source of chemical energy and     
liquid water, that we find life on this planet. We know that Mars, early in     
its history, from the Viking results, did have flowing water on its surface     
in about the time frame that these carbonates are dated to, and so the          
conditions seem to have been ripe for early life to perhaps have evolved on     
that planet. And so if in fact it did, then why wouldn't it have evolved        
also on other places in the early solar system where one might have had         
liquid water and sources of chemical energy. We can go look for those areas     
at other places in our solar system, and there are some potential sites.        
Also, if it originated in this solar system, and on more than one planet in     
this solar system, then why wouldn't it originate on planets in other solar     
systems, and we are just beginning to learn that there are planets around       
other stars -- we're just beginning to detect them -- and we have a program     
that Dan Goldin mentioned called the Origins Program where we're going to go    
look for planets around other stars, other solar systems, and eventually to     
look at their atmospheres and see what kind of environments these planets       
might have had. So it raises the possibility that life may have actually        
arisen elsewhere than this solar system as well.                                
                                                                                
Q [missing]                                                                     
                                                                                
A: ... this question that you ask about seeding. Who is to say that we are      
not all Martians, that Mars was the place where life first started; some        
people claim long ago it had a more hospital environment in terms of being      
warm and wet and so forth, than the Earth even? Or, how do we know that what    
we are seeing on Mars didn't first come from the Earth, through another         
asteroid impact that brought it to Mars -- of course less likely because        
Mars has less gravity, less mass, less gravity than the Earth. But we are       
learning that there is a lot of interchange of matter between various           
planets. We even find in Antarctica, pieces of the moon. So there's all         
types of questions here, including the intriguing possibility that life         
independently started in both places. And we have lots to learn. Provided,      
it's life.                                                                      
                                                                                
Q: I understand that the National Academy of Sciences has set up an             
oversight committee to ensure that any future NASA activities won't result      
in a bad? contamination of Earth with a Martian organism, and I was             
wondering if you could identify some of the members of the committee.           
                                                                                
A: Yes, in fact, the idea of trying to prevent problems due to forward          
contamination of Mars by our sending spacecraft there, or back contamination    
of the Earth by bringing samples back from Mars, was something that got         
started in the early 1970s as we contemplated the first Viking mission,         
which was the first U.S. lander on Mars. And the agency does have a process,    
and it involves the Academy, by which we examine these issues, to make sure     
that we go through every step necessary, such that we do not either             
contaminate Mars, when we send our spacecraft there, or should we go and        
bring a sample back to this planet, that we don't do the reverse. There is a    
process, yes.                                                                   
                                                                                
DANIEL GOLDIN: Let me expand on that. It is the policy of this agency, that     
we would rather not have a mission go, until we are cleared to establish        
that there will be no forward and no back contamination, and that is            
non-negotiable.                                                                 
                                                                                
Q: Yes, David Chandler from the Boston Globe. One of the three principal        
investigators of the Viking life-detection tests has maintained steadfastly     
for the twenty years since that experiment that his, that the labelled          
release experiment did, in fact, produce evidence of current life on Mars.      
That claim has not received a lot of respect in the scientific community. In    
light of this evidence of past life on Mars, do you think there will be a       
reexamination of the results of that experiment, and perhaps a more             
receptive response to his proposal for a follow-on experiment that would        
resolve clearly the results of that experiment one way or another.              
                                                                                
A: Okay, I think I'll handle that one. This result that you heard about         
today has only has something to say about the possibility of life early in      
the planet's history, not really about the existence of life of any sort on     
the planet today. And if in fact through the scientific process it's            
determined that in fact this is good evidence of early life on Mars, that's     
really all it is, but it would, in fact, raise the possibility that that        
life may have continued to evolve on the planet, and I'll ensure, at that       
point, that the scientific community would pass some judgment whether or not    
we should reopen the issue of the third experiment on the Viking lander.        
                                                                                
Q: Barbara Rosewicz of the Wall St. Journal. Can you explain to us how far      
can you go in verifying your theory about life in past Mars by using the        
free samples that we've already gotten from Mars. For example, are there        
additional tests you can run on this particular meteorite that will clear up    
some of the ambiguities? Have you looked at the other chunks and do you find    
the same sort of microorganism and structures through and through? Have you     
looked at the other, although younger meteorites from Mars, yet, or is that     
an avenue you might use?                                                        
                                                                                
A: Yes, we plan to look at this meteorite in much more detail, we plan to       
concentrate on these micro-fossil objects and try to get additional data on     
them to understand their composition and structure. Additionally, there are     
a total of 12 of these Mars meteorites, and we would certainly like to look     
at some of the other ones, I'm sure some of the other teams will start to do    
that now. I think there's an incredible amount of information to be gained      
by doing the types of studies that we did here on the other Mars meteorites,    
and we hope that goes forward vigorously.                                       
                                                                                
Q: Do you need a mission to Mars to be definitive, do you think, or can you     
find the answers in what we've got?                                             
                                                                                
A: Very clearly, we would like to have a good sample from Mars, so that we      
can use it as ground truth, in addition to the 12 samples which we have in      
our collections. And the sample we have from Mars, we have some ideas about     
where we'd like to go and look, and those very clearly would be entered in      
the discussions of the committees and things. But the thing that -- keep in     
mind that the sample we are reporting on today is a very unique sample. It      
is four and a half billion years old. There are no other of the other 12, of    
the other 11 Mars meteorites, the oldest is only 1.2, 1.3 billion years, and    
then the others are around 170, 180 million years old. So this is a unique      
sample that allows us to go back in the window of opportunity and look at       
very early in the history of the planet. Yes, we'd love to have material        
from the surface of the planet, perhaps from depth.                             
                                                                                
A: There's of course this philosophy that you -- in some cases that you         
don't have to go there you can wait until it comes to you or find it and        
it's already come. I think in science, consensus builds slowly, and you'll      
get consensus at one level, and then other people still won't be convinced,     
and ultimately, really, you'll want to go, further, if you care about this      
issue, and I do, a number of us do. So I don't think there's an end. But        
there's more tests to be done with the Martian meteorites we have. One of       
the projects we're setting up at Stanford University is to look now for         
amino acids. Even if we find it, that won't be an answer in itself. But         
these types of evidence, when you put them together -- it's a bunch of lines    
of evidence -- they reinforce each other, each time you end up in some sense    
with a maybe, but if you combine a whole bunch of maybes, you still have a      
maybe, but you're much more confident. That's what's going on.                  
                                                                                
A: And please remember that this meteorite is one of the cleanest samples we    
that we have -- there is very little external contamination on this             
meteorite at all from Antarctica. So as far as sample return, this is as        
close as we get, and it's the best sample we have.                              
                                                                                
Q: This is John Wilford, New York Times. In the, regarding the two missions     
that are planned for launching late this year. Are the landing sites there      
appropriate for searching for any kind of evidence that might corroborate       
your findings? Is there any thought of changing the destination for those       
missions? Is there anything that you'd want to do that you hadn't been          
planning to do already?                                                         
                                                                                
A: In fact, the site that we've chosen for the Mars Pathfinder lander, which    
is launching this year, probably couldn't have been better, actually, if        
we'd have known about this result a long time ago, when we made this            
decision. We selected a site to land in that looks like it's at the mouth of    
a major runoff channel, which has brought a lot of different types of rocks     
and samples from a lot of different types of locations upstream, if you         
will, of this ancient stream bed. And in fact it may be itself an ancient       
lakebed. And so we're going to be looking at rocks, which is something we       
did not do with Viking -- Viking only examined the soil. It had no, there       
was no mobility on the Viking mission. This mission will actually have a        
micro-rover on board which will deploy and it will find its way to various      
rocks and make some very simple chemical mineralogical characterizations of     
that rock. The mission was not designed to look for the kinds of things that    
we're talking about here today, but it was designed with the idea in mind       
that ultimately we're looking for places where we would search, at some         
time, for the potential of early life on this planet.                           
                                                                                
Q: Dr. Goldin, Elaine Douglas, Operation Right-to-Know forum. Regarding your    
assertion that you wanted to re-look at the priorities for the upcoming Mars    
mission? There's a group of scientists, headed by Dr. Sammy McDaniel, that      
has been asking NASA for some number of years now to re-photograph the          
Sidonia land forms at high resolution, and to make these re-photographing on    
the list of top priorities for photographing the Mars surface, and in view      
of the findings announced today, I'm wondering what you would be saying         
about this question of re- photographing the Sidonia land forms at high         
resolution, top priority, and in real time.                                     
                                                                                
DANIEL GOLDIN: There can only be so many top priorities, and if everything      
is number-one priority, we'll never get there. We have a much higher            
resolution capability with this mission, and I'll ask Wes to handle the         
details. We have the mission planned and targeted, and if we have an            
opportunity to get a picture of what some people think is a face on Mars and    
could have been prior, not single-cell life, but higher level of life, if we    
have a chance to get a higher-resolution picture to see what that is, we        
will do that. Let me ask Dr. Huntress to talk about our approach.               
                                                                                
DR. HUNTRESS: You have to remember that what we are talking about today, let    
me just repeat, is only potential evidence for early, very microbial life on    
this planet, not of higher-order forms of life later in the history of the      
planet. So there's no direct bearing on whether or not this formation is the    
result of civilizations on Mars, as some would like to believe -- the great     
majority of the scientific community believes that's not the case. But in       
addition to the lander we're sending later this year, we're also sending an     
orbiter to begin the geological mapping of the planet, in order, in fact, to    
look for the best places on the planet where we would find evidence of early    
life on this planet. And we will, in fact, be getting some fairly high-         
resolution images of various portions of the planet. Now this region is not     
a particular target, but if there's an opportunity to re-photograph it, we      
certainly will. We're certainly going to get better pictures than we got        
last time.                                                                      
                                                                                
Q: High, my name's Bill Cosmos, I'm with the Discovery Channel. Dr. Goldin      
and the people on the panel, do you think that these findings, which are        
quite, quite important, will regenerate the desire for a human mission to       
Mars in the closer future, which has somehow gone back to the sidelines?        
                                                                                
DANIEL GOLDIN: Let me say this: our missions should be driven by scientific     
potential and the potential for economic opportunity, and not be a feel-good    
mission to Mars. Now, Apollo was a wonderful mission, and we set out to get     
to the moon before the Russians, but after we got to the moon, the nation       
said, "Okay, we've arrived, now what are we going to do here?" I think the      
process we ought to undergo is the one you see here today, where we take a      
look at the scientific opportunities and say, is there a reason that a human    
being could go to find out the things we need to find out. Should we send a     
sample return much sooner? Maybe we should be sending a sample return           
mission as the third set instead of the fifth set. As we get material back,     
we should look at it. We also want to make sure that we can do it safely,       
and we can do it within a reasonable cost. I believe we have the potential      
as a nation, and working with other nations, to do it. But the thing I'd        
like to ask people to resist doing, is let's not have a reaction of saying,     
"let's get to Mars as fast as we can," get there, and not know why we're        
there. That is why I thought it was so important to have an open scientific     
discussion, and not have NASA sitting back on the data, and I welcome people    
with diverging views to help us focus on scientific issues, and I feel in my    
stomach, my guts, that we have a great potential to do it, and in the end we    
will probably do it -- but with a reason.                                       
                                                                                
DR. ZARE: I'd like to add to that if I might. I wanted to add that science      
and technology work together; we're talking about exploration. It's very        
important to this country to really keep its sense of exploration, the          
pioneering spirit, the same thing that brought our forebears to the New         
World. And I think there are new worlds to explore in space and elsewhere,      
but we people must be willing to invest in them. When we turn inward, when      
we forget to make these investments, when we lose that will, such nations       
perish.                                                                         
                                                                                
Q: Mark Careau[?], Houston Chronicle for Dr. McCay. Can you give us calendar    
and year when you got the sample, and calendar month and year when you began    
to suspect that you had this discovery, and sort of, what the feeling was       
like as you began to -- what was the inner sense of what you had, and how       
did you begin to wonder about investigating this further.                       
                                                                                
DR. MCKAY: Yes, we got the sample in August of 1994, and started looking at     
it in some detail. The first six months, we didn't really see anything          
exciting, and then we started using some of the new tools. You have to          
remember that the techniques that we used are really state- of-the-art,         
advanced tools that didn't even exist five years ago. And it wasn't until we    
started using these tools that we really got excited, and we really said        
there's something going on here that we don't understand. So I would say        
about a year ago is when we started to get really excited about this rock,      
and we -- I won't say we convinced ourselves, but we became convinced that      
this was a very unusual sample, and I think the results of the past year        
have been just terribly exciting. I have spent many nights in the laboratory    
looking at this rock because I was just too excited to go home -- much to       
the concern of my wife and family. So I would say the past year is when it      
started to really develop.                                                      
                                                                                
Q: Stewart Shammer? from KTRK-ABC in Houston. My question is for Mr. GOLDIN.    
Apologize for the business end of it, but we always seem to be talking          
money. Do you feel that these findings are going to have a position -- a        
positive effect on Congress to help loosen the purse strings, and if you        
want to accelerate the missions you've got to have more money, but do you       
think it will influence Congress or possibly other space agencies around the    
world?                                                                          
                                                                                
DANIEL GOLDIN: Let's not think in the old-think that money is the magic         
ingredient. Let's be in a position where we have science define what we're      
going to do; let's make a meritorious case for that science; let's see what     
we have to do; and let's not just say we're going to do this brute force. I     
think that that would be the wrong approach. We are on a very focused,          
balanced-science approach. I think exploration is necessary, but let's not      
say, "we have found full evidence of low- level biological life on Mars,        
give us money, let's have a big mission." Let's go to a systematic process.     
I don't think we're talking about decades, here. We're talking about a          
relatively short period of time. And when there's an appropriate point in       
time to state our case, let's state our case with the American people to the    
Congress. I'm confident that if we abide by this approach, we'll open up        
everyone's hearts and minds for the future.                                     
                                                                                
Q: John Getter of KHU-TV. Dr. McCay touched on this, for Drs. Gibson or         
Thomas-Keprta. I respect and of course understand your scientific reserve       
and its necessity, and so on. But could you give us some hint as to what you    
felt and thought in your heart when it first dawned on you what you might       
well have your hands on here?                                                   
                                                                                
DR. GIBSON: I guess it really came to a realization of Dave and myself, one     
evening when we were on the electron microscope looking around on this          
sample, and we came to this segmented structure, and that caught our            
attention, and we began to ask each other, is this for real? And I can          
honestly say that evening when I went home, I had difficulty sleeping           
because of the thoughts of what this could be, and I still wondered are we      
sure that this is a segmented structure, is it indigenous to the sample, and    
I've come to the conclusion yes it is, and there are other tests we want to     
do, and we're really excited about getting in this project, and it's            
undoubtedly the most exciting thing I've done in my 27 years as a scientist.    
I have to admit it does beat Apollo in the excitement, and that was tough to    
do.                                                                             
                                                                                
MS. THOMAS-KEPRTA: Well, I think when Dave and Everett first brought me in,     
I have to say I was the doubting Thomas, and as time went on, I became more     
and more convinced, so I'm very pleased to be a part of this project.           
                                                                                
Q: This is Mary Bedden with KPRC-TV in Houston. Because these appear to be      
an early life form, do you, or have you detected anything on Mars that would    
have interrupted the evolution of higher life; and secondly, how conducive,     
now, is the Mars atmosphere to sustaining some sort of higher life form.        
                                                                                
DR. MCKAY: Mars is a very unhospitable place right now, even for the kind of    
life forms that we think we see here. Such life forms could not exist on the    
surface. Mars lacks a atmosphere, except for about 7 millibars, a little bit    
of C02 atmosphere, there's no water on the surface. At some point in Mars'      
history, things went bad. And we're not quite sure when that is, but it's       
some time after the time we're talking about here, when we think we see         
signs of life. Now, things went bad in the sense that the atmosphere mostly     
disappeared, either into space or it got locked up in carbonate rocks in the    
subsurface. And the water dried up, and some of that water went into space;     
some of it may still be there, as ice, as permafrost, or even as a              
groundwater system.                                                             
                                                                                
So the question is what happened to this early life when things went bad?       
And it is one view that that early life retreated underground, and may still    
be there, just as I showed the picture of the bacteria living at several        
kilometers under the surface in the state of Washington, in a similar way,      
the kinds of things we're talking about may have retreated underground, and     
may get their energy from hot springs, and hydrothermal areas, and              
disequilibria from the atmosphere and rocks, and I think, though life cannot    
live on the surface, as we know it, there's still the possibility of this       
kind of life in the subsurface in Mars. That's an exciting question and we      
hope to have the answer to that and the only way we'll know is to go there.     
                                                                                
Q: Mark Careau, the Houston Chronicle. What efforts should be extended to       
look in the Antarctic to look for more of these Martian meteorites and to       
examine them. Would that be fertile research?                                   
                                                                                
A: One of the things which I think is very important is to realize is that      
the effort that is going on in the Antarctic field collection program is a      
very modest program, but its returns have been outstanding. You must            
remember until this program began in the 1970s, we only had around 2,500        
meteorite samples to study in all the collections in the world. This program    
has brought over 10,000 addition samples for the laboratories to look at. We    
found samples from the moon; we now have 9 lunar samples discovered in the      
Antarctic; we have the Martian samples that have now been discovered in the     
Antarctic. For the cost that's being put into this program, versus the          
scientific return, the scientific return is enormous. To save the cost of a     
mission to go to Mars or the moon to return samples from other sites, to        
have it delivered to us, and brought -- be collected by these small field       
parties. Perhaps these small field parties should be increased in their size    
and see to it that they go every year. Because there are concerns on the        
reduction of the budgets in the National Science Foundation, and the effects    
on the whole Antarctic program. But the scientific returns coming from this     
modest amount of money are enormous.                                            
                                                                                
DANIEL GOLDIN: This is an area where we have to do a better job across the      
government. And what we want to do is to make sure we answer scientific         
questions, and if NASA has to put some complimentary funds in this to assure    
that we're getting the right type of data, by God we will -- this is why we     
need this interaction that I've been talking about, and there's the             
direction we want to go in.                                                     
                                                                                
Q: Seth Bornstein from the Orlando Sentinel for Mr. Goldin. How safe -- it      
sounds like what might be best could be underground in the Martian surface.     
How much of a priority is the search for the materials further below the        
surface, which seems to be needing some kind of humans to help guide that,      
and along with that is, how much are you going to increase in terms of the      
number of flights to Mars -- robotic flights to Mars, how much would you        
like to see it increased.                                                       
                                                                                
DANIEL GOLDIN: Well look, again, we want to rely upon the scientific thought    
process, and they ought to help us determine what fraction of the study         
ought to be on the surface or below the surface. Clearly, we're developing      
technology, and in fact, for one of our missions we're talking about going      
down two meters. If we have to go down deeper, we will go down deeper. I        
think what we want to do is carefully reflect on what we learned today, and     
in the months ahead, think about how we want to shape the missions we have      
going to Mars, especially in '96 and '98, but certainly by 2001 we may want     
to consider some very bold missions where we bore down real deep, and we        
bring back samples. This is the process we're going to talk about, and this     
is where the excitement comes in.                                               
                                                                                
Q: This is Charlie Chin, Earth News, I guess we're last realizing that the      
last Mars pathfinder's mass spectrometer was made a couple of years ago and     
it's not a mass spectrometer -- what might the Apex deal with the tube to       
help verify these results we've heard today.                                    
                                                                                
A: If I understood that question correctly, it has to do with the               
composition instrument that's on the micro-rover that's on the Pathfinder       
mission that we're going to launch in December. It's a very simple              
instrument that's of a type that we sent to the moon, for example, earlier,     
on unmanned missions, before Apollo. And what this instrument does is to        
measure the elemental composition of the sample against which you place it,     
and this micro-rover has a little arm that it sticks up against the sides of    
different rocks to determine the elemental composition, from which we can       
infer what kinds of rocks they are, and something about their history. It's     
not a sophisticated instrument by any means like what these folks have used     
in their team, and it's not directed at finding evidence for life on Mars.      
It is directed at finding something about the geology and geochemistry of       
these rock samples.                                                             
                                                                                
DANIEL GOLDIN: This is an area where we want to have to decide will robots      
do the task adequately, or will we have to send human beings,                   
paleontologists and geologists, to do sampling in areas where we have           
robots, and this is a discussion that we're going to have to have, and          
again, I think that there will be some incredible findings, all of which we     
won't be able to predict, but I really ask that we go at this in a              
systematic basis, but maybe we'll move a lot faster than we have in the         
past.                                                                           
                                                                                
Q: Somebody on David's team or maybe even Bill. In 1985, Hans Dieder Fluge      
presented a paper on the possibility of fossilized microbacteria or             
something in a meteorite, even with left-hand DNA. Any thoughts about that      
and how this might either verify that, or might do the same thing as            
happened with him in that he had to back off and eventually nothing came of     
that. A: I am unfamiliar with the study you are talking about. I'm sorry.       
                                                                                
A: Professor Fluge is at Geisen in Germany, and Hans Deider Fluge, and he's     
been involved in studies of ancient life, and of life-like forms in             
meteorites probably for 25 years. I would say with regard to the work of        
professor Fluge, and of many others, we ought to understand that over the       
years, going back into the mid-50s, various scientists around the world have    
reported what they thought might be microscopic fossils in meteorites,          
especially in carbonaceous chondrites, a particular type of meteorite that      
has perhaps three, four, as much as five percent organic carbon in them.        
None of these reports -- and there, not just Professor Fluge, but a great       
number of other scientists, maybe ten, 15, 20, over the past 30 or 40 years,    
have reported such things -- none of them have held up to close scrutiny. So    
I would guess at this time that such reports do not seem to have any bearing    
on the report that we heard today on the Martian meteorite.                     
                                                                                
Q: This is Beth Bickey for Inside States for Mr. GOLDIN and Dr. Huntress.       
You've mentioned this afternoon possibly modifying the scientific goals of      
the Mars Pathfinder based on the information you've released today. The Mars    
Pathfinder is a mere four months from launch. Could you talk a little bit in    
specifics about what you might chance on the probe, and is there really         
enough time to do that, and at what additional costs would NASA be prepared     
to refit the probe?                                                             
                                                                                
DANIEL GOLDIN: I don't believe we were talking specifically about               
Pathfinder. We were talking about a range of 10 spacecraft going to Mars        
over the next decade. We could have very little impact on the Pathfinder        
mission leaving late this fall. So I'll ask Wes to talk about it, but I         
wouldn't expect great changes in that mission. We will recommend to the         
president and the Congress the appropriate funds to resolve the scientific      
issues, As I pointed out earlier in this conference, the President has asked    
the Vice President to have a Space Summit in November, a bipartisan Space       
Summit. At that time, NASA will be prepared to make appropriate                 
recommendations, upon having time to reflect on what we've seen, talking to     
the scientific community, and seeing where we might prioritize our own          
expenditures. We may decide to not do some other things, in order to pay to     
do this work. I want to caution everyone, the nation has a major deficit to     
deal with; we're going to be very responsible in how we conduct our science,    
but if we believe more monies are required, we will then come forward and       
ask for those monies, but we will have real reasons for doing it.               
                                                                                
DR. HUNTRESS: Yes, I mean, we're not talking at all about modifying the         
Pathfinder mission. In fact, Pathfinder's being readied for shipments on a      
live down at KSC next week, if the schedule holds up, and so it's far too       
late to make any major changes to the Pathfinder or to the Mars level           
surveyor orbiter mission for launch this year.                                  
                                                                                
Q: This is Stephan Okolidan for Aeronautica. In the summer of 1976, the         
Viking I probe analysis seemed to indicate the production of some sort of       
gas from one of the soil samples collected by the probe. Now, the biological    
origin of that gas, if I remember correctly, was dismissed because no           
organic matter was found in the soil. Now, does this discovery mean that,       
indeed, in 1976 you may have had an indication of biological activity?          
                                                                                
A: The instrument you're referring to is the gas chromatograph mass             
spectrometer that was on board the Viking landers for both of them, and they    
looked for, in addition to the composition of the atmosphere, they looked at    
the composition of the soil, and specifically to try to look for organic        
material in that soil, and it found none. You have to remember two things.      
One is that the landers, the Viking landers landed in what would be more or     
less desert areas of Mars in order to find a very safe place in which to        
land, and so that kind of reduced the probability of finding organic            
material on the planet, should it be there. Secondly, the sensitivity of        
that spectrometer we sent there over 20 years ago is far less than the          
sensitivities that we're talking about here that we're applying with our        
Earth-based techniques.                                                         
                                                                                
Q: Hi, this is Casey Gold from the LA Times. It seems like in order to          
determine whether or not this is really a microfossil it's very important to    
see whether it has an inside and an outside -- in other words, to be able to    
look inside, and it also seems like you're not going to be getting another      
sample for quite a long time. So my question is what can you do with this       
sample to answer that question.                                                 
                                                                                
DAVE MCCAY: This is Dave McCay. Yes, that's a very important question, and      
what we plan to do, and what other groups may do, is make transmission          
electron microscope thin sections, and try to catch some of these               
microfossil-like forms in the thin section, and then with the transmission      
electron microscope, we will be able to see inside, and we will be able to      
see if there's a membrane, perhaps -- we will be able to see if there's any     
remains of the original cell, machinery, left. Those are questions that can     
be answered with very careful, tedious transmission electron microscope         
work, and we will go in that direction, and we hope other groups do as well.

NASA BRIEFING ON DISCOVERY OF POSSIBLE EARLY MARTIAN LIFE [continued (Part      
Five)]                                                                          
                                                                                
DAVE MCKAY: This is Dave McCay. Yes, that's a very important question, and      
what we plan to do, and what other groups may do, is make transmission          
electron microscope thin sections, and try to catch some of these               
microfossil-like forms in the thin section, and then with the transmission      
electron microscope, we will be able to see inside, and we will be able to      
see if there's a membrane, perhaps -- we will be able to see if there's any     
remains of the original cell, machinery, left. Those are questions that can     
be answered with very careful, tedious transmission electron microscope         
work, and we will go in that direction, and we hope other groups do as well.    
                                                                                
Q: This is a question -- this is Dave Perlman at the San Francisco Chronicle    
-- it's a question for Dr. Schopf. Could you amplify a little bit about the     
two factors to which you've given the lowest confidence rating, the lowest      
subjective confidence rating; that is to say the environment and history        
aspects of this meteorite examination.                                          
                                                                                
DR. SCHOPF: Thank you. That of course is an interesting question. The areas     
that I have suggested are open for further discussion have to do with the       
environment and the history of emplacement of the carbonate in these            
fractures. I simply point out that in Nature Magazine in July, these            
carbonate rocks, the carbonate minerals, were interpreted by one group of       
scientists as having been formed by hot, carbon-dioxide-rich fluids that        
permeated -- percolated -- up into them at temperatures of 450 degrees          
Celsius.                                                                        
                                                                                
The alternative view, and certainly the one that is favored by the Johnson      
Spacecraft, NASA people, is that those same carbonate minerals were formed      
at temperatures below 80 degrees Celsius -- so relatively cool. Now if          
they're relatively cool, life could live there. If it's 450 degrees, you're     
frying like a fried egg, you don't have any chance of life existing under       
those conditions -- carbon bonds break down.                                    
                                                                                
So I simply point out that here's a paper in July, here's a paper in August,    
in two of the most prestigious scientific journals in the world. And to the     
satisfaction of those two groups, this matter has not yet been resolved, and    
I don't have an opinion -- although I think the guys here at NASA make          
pretty good arguments.                                                          
                                                                                
Secondly, with regard to the time of emplacement of the carbonates in those     
fractures. If there was a biota on Mars, and if that biota was associated       
with the carbonate in those fractures, and if that meteorite actually comes     
from Mars, the fracture has to be there before the thing gets lifted off and    
brought to earth. The alternative view is that the fractures were caused        
when a bolide, an impacting body, hit Mars and blasted it off. Well, if it      
hit, and blasted it off, there wouldn't be life living in that and the -- at    
450 degrees and so forth -- the point is that there's another area that         
needs to be discussed, understood, clearly defined. On the one hand, it         
makes it reasonable for life to have been there, on the other hand, it          
suggests that it's absolutely impossible. I just simply point out that          
that's something that has to be looked at.                                      
                                                                                
DR. GIBSON: I feel that one of the things -- the strongest bit of evidence      
that supports the low-temperature formation of these carbonates, comes from     
four lines of evidence. The first one is the oxygen isotopic data. That data    
from the oxygen 1816 ratio suggests the temperature formation between zero      
degrees and eighty degrees centigrade. This is very compelling evidence for     
a low-temperature formation.                                                    
                                                                                
The second data point, is within these carbonates, we have the presence of      
gregite. Gregite decomposes at 250 degrees C. If the temperature was above      
250 degrees C, the gregite would not be present.                                
                                                                                
The third is the presence of these organic molecules that professor Zare has    
seen. If this organic molecules had been heated to above 400 degrees, they      
would have begun to degrade, and we would have seen the fragments of this,      
and we do not see any evidence of this in the spectrum -- we seen nice clean    
spectrum which suggests there have been lower temperatures involved.            
                                                                                
The fourth point is a mineralogical point, and if one had been subjected to     
high temperatures, in the carbonates, like in the metamorphic process,          
elevated temperatures, some of these minerals would have equilibrated and       
homogenized; we did not see this. We see these compositional variations in      
there.                                                                          
                                                                                
So we feel from these four data points, that the temperature is very clearly    
established as low temperature, in the range that would support life. The       
second point that professor Schopf raised, has to do with the emplacement of    
the carbonates. There's evidence within the thin sections and also other        
data that shows that some of these carbonates have been fractured, and this     
fracturing could occur when the material was removed from the surface of        
Mars, that is the carbonates were emplaced already at the time of the shock     
event. Now alternative: it could have been it underwent a shock in space, as    
it traveled through space, but the evidence does not show there might have      
been a collision on this particular meteorite as it traveled through space      
prior to its coming into Earth.                                                 
                                                                                
David?                                                                          
                                                                                
DAVID MCKAY: Also, the carbonates fill some of these fractures. The             
carbonates have been dated as 3.6 billion years old. So the fractures had to    
occur on Mars.                                                                  
                                                                                
Q: This is Eller Woods from the Palo Alto weekly. Some of the panelists         
mentioned that organic molecules have been found in meteorites. Is this         
Martian rock the first evidence of life beyond earth?                           
                                                                                
A: The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that we have found -- Simon Clemett,    
Rick Maechling, Xavier Chillier -- really are the first organic molecules we    
believe that you can attribute to Mars. But as I've said before, finding        
organic molecules does not mean that they came from living things. That's       
not what our arguments are based on. Instead, our arguments are based on a      
combination of things whose best explanation, our simplest explanation, in      
our opinion, is to believe that there was some biogenic activity, long ago,     
on Mars.                                                                        
                                                                                
Q: ... concise. Number one, I believe you mentioned at the beginning of this    
new data to add to the Science report. If so, what is that new data. Number     
two, you talked about some TEM tests that you'd like to do in the future;       
what are some of the other tests to come on these samples?                      
                                                                                
A: Most of the new data that we referred to that is not in the science paper    
are the photographs that you saw, the SEM photographs. Only one of those was    
published in the Science paper, or will be published in the Science paper.      
Most of those were actually made since the review process of the Science        
paper. In terms of new work on the sample? I think that as I said we're         
going to do additional TEM work on it, I think we want to do some additional    
organic analysis, and we really think that there are parts of that sample       
that need to be investigated in much more detail, and we hope to do so.         
Amino acids is one of the things that we're going to look for next.             
                                                                                
Q: Yes, Jamie Shreve from Discover Magazine. I'd like to ask Dr. Schopf if      
he could characterize a smoking gun that could convince him that these          
microfossils are biological, and do we have the techniques available to         
confirm or deny that.                                                           
                                                                                
DR. SCHOPF: Absolutely. Absolutely I can characterize the data that would be    
-- I would characterize as a smoking gun, and absolutely it can be done. I      
would suggest the following, and understand that I'm assuming that the sort     
of life that these fossil-like objects might represent -- I'm assuming that     
that type of life is like Earth life. If someone were to tell me that life      
on Mars was solid state chemistry, that life on Mars was indistinguishable      
from a quartz crystal, then I would say it looks to me like a quartz            
crystal. And somebody would have to say, well, it's alive for the following     
reasons, okay?                                                                  
                                                                                
So I have to predicate it, my remarks, by saying I assume it's like life on     
Earth in its broadest sense: made out of carbon compounds, which we refer to    
as organic compounds -- carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and          
phosphorus - CHONPHS. Now, I'm assuming it will be like that; I'm assuming      
that for it to be alive it must be separated from the exterior by a             
membrane, a wall, a layer -- some definitive boundary that bounds the           
outside that is the environment, and the inside, where I must assume that       
aqueous chemistry, that is, water-based chemistry, must occur. Because all      
the chemistry of cells of living systems on this planet, do their chemistry     
in water -- that's because we evolved in an aqueous environment, and so         
forth.                                                                          
                                                                                
So give me those sort of three constraints, then you say how can they go        
ahead and nail this thing shut to my satisfaction? Well, what I would be        
delighted to see would be transmission electron micrographs that showed a       
cell wall that has an electron density like that of carbonaceous material.      
This can be done; it's not hard to do, it's going to take some real             
manipulation to do this, but I can imagine how to do it and they have           
already imagined how to do it. That's number one.                               
                                                                                
Number two, I'd like to see some size data to show me that this is a            
population of organisms; that it is distinctly different from the mineralic     
material in which it is embedded. That's a characteristic of life; it's not     
like minerals, it's biological, okay. And I would like also -- and I'd think    
it's not at all far-fetched because we do it all the time in the Earth's        
fossil record -- I'd like to see some evidence of cell division, I'd like to    
understand the life cycle of this fossil-like organism. You give me those       
three things, and I'd like to see data on a couple thousand individuals --      
no, you ask a lot; I can tell you, and you say, "oh, that sounds like a         
lot," in the Apex Chur[?], the oldest fossils on this planet, I have            
personally measured 1900 cells, 1950 cells, that's what is required to nail     
this thing. Okay, give me 500 -- that's enough, that's enough. But if those     
sorts of things -- they are doable, the techniques are available, and I'll      
bet you, as soon as these guys can get on a plane, they're going to shoot       
back down to Houston, and by golly, they're going to get another paper in       
Science, and I hope that they can nail this thing absolutely shut tight.        
                                                                                
LAURIE BOEDER: Thank you, and the last word will have to be from our outside    
skeptic. We've run out of time, and Mr. GOLDIN would like to make a closing     
statement to wrap up today's news conference.                                   
                                                                                
DANIEL GOLDIN: Again, let me remind everyone we are in the middle of a          
process, and we opened the door. We felt that NASA must share what it does      
with the American people, and we are prepared for the outcome either way,       
but the outcome will be the right outcome because it will be driven by          
science. Saying that on a rational level, on an emotional level, we are a       
very bold nation, and NASA reflects the excitement and the boldness of this     
nation. NASA will be ready to take the next step. If we have to go send         
sample return missions much sooner from Mars, we will do it. If we have to      
map the Martian surface from above, we will do it. If we have to dig down       
into the depths of Mars, we will do it. If we need people to perform these      
functions, we will use them. We will make it safe, and we will help America     
and the world understand who we are, and what we are, and how we relate to      
our universe. Thank you very much.                                              
                                                                                
END OF NEWS CONFERENCE

Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung, much like fellow formalists David            
Lynch, Jane Campion and Atom Egoyan, is a man obsessed with texture             
and ritual. His characters tend to reveal their dreams and motives              
more through the things they collect or consume than in whatever they           
might have to say for themselves. His Oscar-nominated previous movie,           
The Scent Of Green Papaya, played like Jane Eyre gone illiterate: a             
long, quiet, physically seductive meditation on a poor housekeeper's            
mainly unrequited passion for her boss.                                         
                                                                                
Now he gives us Cyclo (a term interchangeably used to describe either           
Hung's nameless pedal-cab driver protagonist or the bicycle taxi he             
uses to ferry tourists around Ho Chi Minh City) -- equally long and             
sensuous, but hardly as comforting.                                             
                                                                                
Forced to take up his dead father's profession in order to support the          
rest of his family, the Cyclo (Le Van Loc) is quickly caught up in a            
hallucinatory round of frenzied work and little reward. When his cyclo          
is stolen, he is compelled to rely on the non-existent mercies of his           
female employer, who allows him to work off his debt by renting out             
his services to the Poet (Tony Leung-Chiu Wai, late of Chungking                
Express). The Poet is a sensitive gangster equally given to ruthless            
murder and stress-related nosebleeds, who also happens to be romancing          
(and pimping) the Cyclo's beautiful elder sister.                               
                                                                                
This Dickensian, complex plot provides Hung with just the right canvas          
on which to arrange some truly original -- and startlingly alien --             
images: the Cyclo thrusting his filth-covered face into a goldfish              
tank; burning money rising in a sudden updraft; a man with his throat           
slit dying unnoticed on a roof-top in the heart of the city. Humans             
plot and scurry, just self-aware enough to be depressed by the                  
inevitable realization that they're not so existentially different              
from the lizards infesting their walls, or the insects eating their             
food.                                                                           
                                                                                
It all makes Cyclo both difficult going and one of the most                     
impressive, fully integrated cinematic spectacles I've seen all year.

No. 295                    1996 Aug 13               Cambridge, MA

Time to catch up after my vacation...                                           
                                                                                
Shuttle and Mir                                                                 
---------------                                                                 
                                                                                
The new cargo ship, Progress vehicle No. 232 (Progress M-32) was                
successfully launched on Jul 31 by a Soyuz-U rocket. This was the first         
successful launch of a Soyuz-U after two failures. Progress M-32  docked        
with the Mir complex at the forward (-X) docking port at 2203 UTC on Aug        
2. The old cargo ship, Progress M-31, undocked from the same port on Aug        
1 at 1645 UTC and was deorbited over the south Pacific later that day.          
Meanwhile, EO-22 crew commander Gennady Manakov has been taken ill and          
removed from the Soyuz TM-24 crew due for launch this month (the exact          
date is in question because of possible launch vehicle  problems). The          
new crew is reportedly:                                                         
                                                                                
 Komandir (Commander)- Valeriy Korzun, RKA cosmonaut  (first flight)            
 Bortinzhener (Flight Engineer)- Aleksandr Kaleri, RKA cosmonaut                
   (flew on Soyuz TM-14 in 1992).                                               
 Kosmonavt-issledovatel' (Researcher Cosmonaut) - Claudie Andre-Deshays,        
   CNES (French Space Agency, first flight).                                    
Currently aboard the station are the EO-21 crew of Yuriy Onufrienko,            
Yuriy Usachyov and NASA astronaut Shannon Lucid.                                
                                                                                
Note: A reader asked about the use of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).         
It's the precisely defined equivalent of the colloquial GMT (Greenwich          
Mean Time), and is distinguished from other GMT type timescales                 
like TAI (atomic time), TT (Terrestrial dynamical time), etc. which             
are different by under a minute. Since I don't often give times to              
the closest second, you can just read `GMT' if you like.                        
                                                                                
The new external tank for STS-79, ET-81, has been connected to the solid        
boosters; Atlantis was towed back from the Orbiter Processing Facility          
to the Vehicle Assembly Building today (Aug 13) and will be added to the        
new stack later today. The old stack will eventually be disassembled            
for refurbishment.                                                              
                                                                                
Recent Launches                                                                 
---------------                                                                 
                                                                                
Another successful Ariane launch - Arianespace flight V90  placed two           
European domestic comsats in orbit on Aug 8. Italsat F2 is a domestic           
Ka-band comsat built by Alenia Spazio for the Italian Space Agency, and         
is operated (and owned?) by Telecom Italia. The second satellite,               
Telecom 2D, is a Matra Marconi Space Eurostar 2000 satellite, owned             
jointly by France Telecom and the French Defense Ministry. V90 used an          
Ariane 44L rocket, with 4 PAL strapon rockets, an L220 first stage, an          
L33 second stage, and an H-10-3 third stage. The H-10-3 entered                 
geostationary transfer orbit, and then released Italsat F2 which was            
mounted on a compartment called SMS (a nested bilingual acronym! SMS =          
Stretched Mini SPELDA, SPELDA = Structure Portuese Enceinte de Lancement        
Double Ariane, if I remember correctly. Way to go, ESA!). The SMS cover         
was ejected followed by release of the Telecom 2D which was stored              
underneath it. The two satellites entered a 260 x 36877 km x 5.3 deg            
transfer orbit. Both have US-built R-4D liquid apogee engines to raise their    
orbits to geostationary. Italsat F2 made its first burn on Aug 10,              
raising perigee to 9200 km and lowering inclination to 2.4 deg.                 
Telecom 2D was still in its original orbit on Aug 11.                           
                                                                                
Note that Ariane flight V88 never happened; the press kit for the June launch   
was V87, and for the July launch was V89. I assume that                         
the Ariane V501 flight has been retrospectively designated V88 (or V87)         
- can anyone confirm?                                                           
                                                                                
The Atlas AC-125 launch was from pad 36A. The Progress M-23                     
launch was probably from pad 1.                                                 
                                                                                
NASA's DC-XA reusable suborbital rocket was destroyed  after a test             
flight on Jul 31 when it toppled over after touchdown.

Inspection of launch photographs indicates that the launch of 1963 Jan 16       
from Vandenberg was a Thor Agena B and not a Thor Agena D as most               
records indicate. Can anyone confirm?

What is DynamIP?                                                                
  DynamIP allows you to post your dynamic IP address to a file                  
  of your choice and then have this file uploaded automatically.                
  Very useful for advanced Internet users to keep their web pages               
  updated with their current IP address. Of course, you can also                
  use it to update any other file of your choice (e.g. your .plan               
  or .project file so that your finger server reports your current              
  IP address...).                                                               
                                                                                
What else do you need?                                                          
  You need the latest version of Microsoft's Internet ActiveX[tm]               
  Controls and install them on your system. Get the controls from

  Some users might not have all the necessary OCX files in their                
  system folder. Check http://www.stanford.edu/~cmu/DynamIP.htm

  v0.5 (26-JUL-96) added menu (finally!),                                       
                   added tray capability (to reduce task bar clutter),          
                   fixed another timing problem in disconnect ;-)               
                   icon that hints at the state (on, busy, off)                 
  v0.4 (24-JUL-96) fixed timing problem in disconnect                           
  v0.3 (06-JUL-96) connect more stable, disconnect faster,                      
                   auto-minimize if going on/off-line successful                
  v0.2 (28-JUN-96) added timeout feature                                        
  v0.1 (27-JUN-96) quickly wrote this thing 'cause I needed it

(FAQ) Astronomical Calculations for the Amateur                                 
===============================================                                 
                                                                                
Revised July 24, 1996.                                                          
                                                                                
[This FAQ is limited to questions about calculating planetary                   
positions and related problems of spherical astronomy. Other                    
areas of interest, such a calculations of telescope optics, are                 
beyond the bounds of this document].                                            
                                                                                
Calculation of astronomical events is a vast field with                         
literature stretching back centuries, even to ancient times.                    
This "frequently asked questions" list is directed toward the                   
amateur astronomer who is looking for starting points. If you                   
become familiar with the first two books recommended below, you                 
will be well on your way. You will, in fact, have surpassed the                 
author of the FAQ!                                                              
                                                                                
Of course, I invite your suggestions.

    headings "Spherical Astronomy" and "Celestial Mechanics" would              
    be the places to start.                                                     
                                                                                
2. What is the best beginner's book?                                            
                                                                                
    _Astronomical Algorithms_ by Jean Meeus, Willmann-Bell 1991,                
    $24.95. Software supplements in Basic, Pascal and C are                     
    available to purchasers of the book for $24.95 each.                        
                                                                                
    Although it requires some study, this is the closest thing to a             
    "cookbook" approach I have seen. Better than that, it explains              
    and makes comprehensible many difficult concepts, and has many              
    worked examples and illustrations. It is not restricted to                  
    elementary problems, but treats many advanced topics. No                    
    calculus is required.                                                       
                                                                                
    Beginners face two obstacles before they can calculate anything             
    useful: (1) they must learn to convert between civil and                    
    astronomical dates and times (a task made more difficult by the             
    fact that the Earth's rate of rotation is variable), and (2)                
    they must learn a number of translations between coordinate                 
    systems (Sun-centered to Earth-centered to location-centered, as            
    well as ecliptic to equatorial to horizon) and the application              
    of corrections for precession and nutation and parallax. This is            
    why questions such as "How do I predict the location of the                 
    moon?" do not have simple answers. You must know how to do (1)              
    and (2) before you can start on the moon.                                   
                                                                                
    The proper order of corrections and coordinate conversions had              
    previously been very confusing for me, but Meeus gave me                    
    everything I needed to overcome these obstacles.                            
                                                                                
    He covers the basics of time and coordinate transformations,                
    corrections for precession and nutation, and for the observer's             
    true "topocentric" location as offset from the center of the                
    Earth. For any given time, you can predict the positions of the             
    Sun, Moon and planets and derive all the normal phenomena of the            
    almanac. You can derive physical ephemerides (that is, the                  
    orientation of the objects as seen through a telescope) for the             
    Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Mars and Saturn's rings. He provides both               
    low-precision and high-precision techniques for charting                    
    Jupter's four largest moons. The Keplerian techniques of dealing            
    with the orbits of new bodies such as comets and asteroids are              
    also given.                                                                 
                                                                                
    IMPORTANT NOTE #1: Ask for the errata sheet when you place your             
    order from the publisher. There are typos in the text, and some             
    errors in the software supplements.                                         
                                                                                
    IMPORTANT NOTE #2: I *strongly* recommend that you get one of               
    the software supplements. Not only is the source code very                  
    illuminating, but Meeus relies on some modern table-driven                  
    models which would be unfeasible to type in yourself. Pay the               
    $24.95 and get a diskette. The software is for DOS machines, but            
    I had no trouble translating the C-language version to                      
    Macintosh. (I did have to write a small DOS program to unpack               
    the large data tables).                                                     
                                                                                
3. How much computer power does it take to perform these                        
calculations?                                                                   
                                                                                
    Modern personal computers, especially those with floating point             
    hardware, are very capable machines. Calculating the position of            
    all the planets several different ways, using Meeus' techniques,            
    takes my 68040 a small fraction of a second. Performance on a               
    PowerPC or Pentium would be stunning.                                       
                                                                                
4. What is a more advanced reference work?                                      
                                                                                
    _Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac_, edited by             
    P.K. Seidelmann, University Science Books 1992, 752 pages, $65              
    (available from Willmann-Bell).                                             
                                                                                
    "Completely Revised and Rewritten", so make you sure you get the            
    1992 edition.                                                               
                                                                                
    This explains how the data in the annual "Astronomical Almanac"             
    is produced. It is also a high-quality spherical astronomy text             
    with many references to the current research literature. If                 
    you've read Meeus and want "more", this is the logical next                 
    step.                                                                       
                                                                                
    Note that it contains very few worked examples and the math is              
    much more advanced than in Meeus. Some of the chapters deal with            
    issues of the professional astronomer that will not usually                 
    concern the amateur. Examples: plate tectonic motion can cause              
    an observing site to shift its position several centimeters per             
    year. Ocean tidal pressure on the continental shelves, and                  
    atmospheric pressure above the continents, can cause elevation              
    to vary by similar amounts.                                                 
                                                                                
    Note also that they use a different method of calculating                   
    planetary positions than does Meeus.                                        
                                                                                
5. Are there any relevant periodicals for amateurs?                             
                                                                                
    _Sky & Telescope_ magazine has an astronomical computing column.            
                                                                                
    _Astronomy_ publishes programs from time to time.                           
                                                                                
    Willmann-Bell sells back issues of _Celestial Computing_, "A                
    Journal for Personal Computers and Celestial Mechanics", dated              
    from 1988 through 1992, edited by David Eagle. This seems to be             
    no longer published.                                                        
                                                                                
6. Where are online sources of algorithms?                                      
                                                                                
    _Sky & Telescope_ maintains an archive of program sources which             
    have appeared in the magazine:

    Unfortunately, these consist of uncommented BASIC listings.                 
    Pseudo-code articles would be of greater use to those trying to             
    understand the calculations.                                                
                                                                                
    _Astronomy_ magazine provides a small set of BASIC programs:

    Sites listed in the next topic also have software.

8. What commercial and shareware programs are available?

    I have recently completed a freeware program which might interest           
    you. It's called the "Windows Ephemeris Tool" and it calculates             
    tables of positions (and other data) for comets and asteroids.

    I am very impressed with a program called ASTROWIN, sometimes               
    referred to as ASTROMEUSS (It uses Meuss' algorithms). I got my             
    copy from Starbase One BBS, but I am sure it must be on the WEB             
    somewhere. It is simple, fast and accurate. Text-only output. I             
    use it a lot.

9a. How do I convert right ascension and declination to altitude                
and azimuth?                                                                    
                                                                                
    Given the hour angle H of the object with right ascension RA and            
    declination DEC, and the observer's latitude LAT:                           
                                                                                
        azimuth  =                                                              
            atan2(sin(H), cos(H) * sin(LAT) - tan(DEC) * cos(LAT))              
                                                                                
        altitude =                                                              
            asin(sin(LAT) * sin(DEC) + cos(LAT)* cos(DEC) * cos(H))             
                                                                                
    where "atan2(x,y)" is C-library function equivalent to                      
    "atan(x/y)".                                                                
                                                                                
    Bill Owen <wmo@wansor.jpl.nasa.gov> offers the following comments:          
                                                                                
      For the azimuth, it might be better to multiply both numerator and        
      denominator by cos(DEC).  Granted that the answer should turn out         
      the same either way, since 0/something = something else/infinity,         
      but you'll avoid the overflow that would otherwise result when you        
      compute tan(DEC) near the poles.                                          
                                                                                
      Also, the formula you have here is zero when you're looking south.        
      Although there are different conventions, the most common one             
      reckons azimuth eastward from *north*.                                    
                                                                                
      Combine these nits, and the formula I use is:                             
                                                                                
          azimuth = atan2 (-sin(H)*cos(DEC),                                    
                     cos(LAT)*sin(DEC) - sin(LAT)*cos(DEC)*cos(H) )             
                                                                                
9b. What's the hour angle?                                                      
                                                                                
    Given an object with right ascension RA and the observer's                  
    longitude LONG, and the sidereal time at Greenwich ST:                      
                                                                                
        H = ST - LONG - RA                                                      
                                                                                
    where LONG is positive to the west and ST is represented as an              
    angle. If you measure longitude to the east:                                
                                                                                
        H = ST + LONG - RA.                                                     
                                                                                
9c. What's the sidereal time?                                                   
                                                                                
    Everything seems to depend on something else, doesn't it? Better            
    get the Meeus book described in [2] above.                                  
                                                                                
10. How do I predict the ocean tides?                                           
                                                                                
    I have never heard of an amateur doing this. The _Explantory                
    Supplement_ has a small section on the subject and the method               
    seems quite complex.                                                        
                                                                                
11. How do I calculate the date of Easter?                                      
                                                                                
    Many people know the formula:                                               
                                                                                
        Easter is the first Sunday after the first full Moon following          
        the vernal equinox.                                                     
                                                                                
    Caution! This is "astronomical Easter", and it is usually but               
    not always the same day as "ecclesiastical Easter", which is the            
    date used by the churches and printed on calendars.                         
    "Ecclesiastical Easter" is determined by a formula codified many            
    years ago.                                                                  
                                                                                
    Here is the method published in the _Explanatory Supplement_.               
    Perform integer math and drop all remainders. It is valid for               
    any Gregorian year "Y":

        K = (C - 17) / 25                                                       
        I = C - C / 4 - (C - K) / 3 + 19 * N + 15

        I = I - (I / 28) * (1 - (I / 28) * (29 / (I + 1)) *                     
                ((21 - N) / 11))                                                
        J = Y + Y / 4 + I + 2 - C + C / 4

        L = I - J                                                               
        M = 3 + (L + 40) / 44                                                   
        D = L + 28 - 31 * (M / 4)

New Meade Starfinder 8 inch Dobsonian Review                                    
                                                                                
First off, this is not a Meade-bashing exercise.  I am                          
trying to give a blow-by-blow of my first experiences with this                 
telescope.  This will say as much about my skills as about                      
Meadeís product.   On the whole, though, I think it will be                     
balanced, since I am at or around the level that most astro                     
amateurs who have owned a telescope or two.  Anyway,  please                    
point out any glaring stupidities, I need to learn.                             
                                                                                
I bought this dob as a stop-gap.  I am saving for an                            
observatory and several high-quality scopes.  I put my only                     
scope, a Celestron refractor SP102 up for sale because it is has                
proven too unwieldy for me.  I am 5í3", not very strong,  have                  
narrow doorways and large dogs, and have found out that                         
sometimes negotiating these was too much of a hassle.  I will                   
miss the nice crisp images and contrast,  but since I was only                  
using maybe it one out of two opportunities, I decided I would be               
better off with something else that Iíd use more frequently.                    
Additionally,  I have found I dislike the combination of an                     
equatorial mount and a longish refractor.  Itís great for tracking,             
but I like to look at stuff all over the sky, and donít like to                 
readjust the tripod and fumble with the clutches to get the                     
eyepiece to a comfortable height for viewing.  What I needed was                
a scope easy to get outdoors, not too heavy, no nightly assembly,               
and easy to point.  The dob fills this bill.                                    
                                                                                
I went The Astronomy Shoppe  (where I spend way too                             
much time),  to make my purchase.   I had actually narrowed                     
down my selection to a Meade 6" dob or a Meade ETX.  I                          
decided against the ETX for several reasons, even thought the                   
optics were an enticement and having a drive and motion                         
controls would be nice.  First, I guess was aperture.  I like the               
deep-sky stuff, but it had already been too challenging with the                
refractor to find some things, and I couldnít see the ETX doing                 
any better.  Second was the additional stuff required with the                  
ETX, like a stable tripod and pan head.  This would add                         
appreciably to the cost.  Finally, there just seemed to be too many             
pieces to it that I couldnít control.  If it gets out of collimation,           
itís tougher than the Newtownian to fix.  The drive needs polar                 
alignment to work, and that kind of fails the simple setup I was                
after.  If something were to go wrong with the drive, Iíd rather                
not crack it open and fix it - I just donít have that kind of time              
normally, and would procrastinate. (Iím on vacation this week,                  
so I had time to assemble the 8 inch.)                                          
                                                                                
I also decided to go with the 8 inch over the 6 inch for                        
several reasons.  The additional aperture represents additional                 
light gathering, resolution and magnification for little extra size,            
weight or cost.  I could still stop it down to a 6 inch if I needed             
more immunity to Phoenixís light pollution, and still have decent               
aperture.  I considered the 10 inch, but the size and weight                    
started to leave my realm of practicality, and the f4.5 would                   
suffer in my neighborhood skies.                                                
                                                                                
Why Meade instead of Orion or Celestron?  The                                   
Astronomy Shoppe doesnít stock the others for quality issues.                   
They are a strong supporters of Celestron in most cases, but cited              
a few deficits in the Starhoppers.  They had even less good to say              
about Orion.  This is not the most impartial way to make a                      
decision, but Iíve grown to trust their judgement.  Iíd like to hear            
other opinions about this.                                                      
                                                                                
The scope comes in 2 boxes, one which contains the                              
tube, focuser, eyepiece and mirror, the other containing the                    
unassembled mount.  The tube assembly box just barely fit into                  
my 1991 Camaro, but it is a bit longer than the tube itself, so the             
scope will fit easily in the car.  The shipping cardboard is not all            
that thick, and one of the tube assembly boxes shipped to The                   
Astronomy Shoppe had been damaged in shipping.  The tube is                     
supported within the box by pieces molded Styrofoam.  The                       
mirror is in a Styrofoam enclosure, as are the focuser and                      
eyepiece.  The protection seems adequate, if a little on the flimsy             
side.  Iím not sure the mirror package would endure NASAís                      
drop tests.                                                                     
                                                                                
I unpacked all of the pieces for assembly.  The manual                          
is thin, but detailed enough to allow an uneventful assembly.  It               
is better than most furniture assembly manuals I have seen.  The                
same manual is used for all the Starfinders form the 6 inch                     
through the 12.5 inch. Thereís really little chance for confusion               
of parts.                                                                       
                                                                                
The mount needed to be assembled first.  Two circular                           
wood plates constitute the azimuth bearing.  The lower plate has                
3 Teflon pads which the upper plate glides along for movement                   
in the azimuth plane.  The plates are kept in place by a center                 
bearing bushing which a bolt goes through. Nylon washers are                    
placed over the bushing to maintain separation between the                      
plates.  Meade provides 6 of these washers, but only 5 are                      
required.  If you use 6, the mount is very unsteady, and if you use             
4, then the mount wonít move in the azimuth. Little rubber pads                 
need to be placed on the bottom of the lower plate (the ground                  
side) for legs.   The rest of the mount is simple to construct.                 
                                                                                
In constructing the tube assembly,  the manual instructs                        
to put on the focuser first.  Since you are likely to rotate the tube           
in order to fasten the mirror,  I would recommend putting in the                
mirror first.  The mirror is covered in paper, which is something               
between lens paper and gift box stuffing.  The mirror assembly is               
quite heavy, as it must be to help balance the telescope.  There                
are no openings behind the mirror to allow air in to cool it.  The              
mirror is made of Pyrex, so maybe Meade thought this was                        
enough.  It was very dusty, so I used the brush side of my Lens                 
Pen to remove the dust.  There were a number of small chips                     
around the outside of the mirror, but none that would appear to                 
affect the image.  There was a small scratch, about 2mm by 5mm                  
about 1 inch from the edge.  The rest of the surface looked quite               
good.  The mirror is installed by aligning 2 red dots, and then                 
screwing in 4 bolts with an Allen wrench.  This was simple to                   
do.                                                                             
                                                                                
The focuser is pretty cheap.  It is plastic.  The rack and                      
pinion mechanism is metal, but shifts.  The metal components                    
were covered with grease, which had leaked onto a lot of the                    
focus tube.  It took some cleaning to get it usable.  The hole for              
the focuser was a little unevenly cut, as were the screw holes to               
fasten it.  The screws and bolts which fasten the focuser in are all            
highly reflective, which is curious, since Meade seams to have                  
gone to pains to blacken every other surface.  In all, I am                     
convinced that I will need to purchase a better focuser.   I need a             
2 inch focuser anyway, so itís no trouble for me.  Just remember                
that this is probably a necessary expense.  The secondary mirror                
is shipped already assembled in the tube.  It is fairly solid.                  
                                                                                
Once assembled, I placed the tube onto the mount.  The                          
altitude bearings were very greasy, and some of the grease had                  
gotten on the tube, so I had to clean that off.  The tube would not             
balance at first without an eyepiece, but after using it some  I                
found it would balance with all of my eyepieces in most all                     
positions.  The 22mm panoptic gives it a little trouble below 30                
degrees from the horizon.  Iíll need to make a weight pack.                     
                                                                                
On the whole, the assembly wasnít too bad.   One thing                          
irritated me a little.  The manual states clearly "Meade telescopes             
are accurately collimated at the factory prior to shipment, so                  
collimation adjustments will probably not be necessary."  This                  
may be true, but my scope was way out of alignment.  The                        
diagonal mirror was off-center, and tilted wrong, and the main                  
mirror  was also tilted, and required several full turns on each                
collimation bolt.  None of this was tough, just annoying.  The                  
collimation mechanisms they provide are good, and the manual                    
gives decent coverage of how to collimate.                                      
                                                                                
After all of this, Iíve had nothing but clouds, moon or                         
terrible seeing, so no good star tests yet.  All out-of-focus stuff             
just shows atmospheric jumpiness.  The star images do come to a                 
decent focus (not as good as my refractor, but passable), and I do              
see stuff  that I couldnít get with the refractor.  I see more of               
Jupiter than I did with the refractor, but the image is jumpier,                
especially around the edges.  The contrast also suffers in                      
comparison, but it is certainly acceptable.   Iíll report more when             
I can test it more thoroughly.                                                  
                                                                                
The manual positioning of the scope is a pleasure.  I                           
added a telrad, and it is almost no work to find (reasonably                    
bright) objects I am looking for.  I am enjoying this aspect of                 
using the telescope.                                                            
                                                                                
My first impressions are that the optical quality is good,                      
but not great, and that this will be the usable scope I was looking             
for.  I am happy, especially considering the price.  This will keep             
me satisfied until I can build  the observatory,  and probably                  
longer.

Starring Catherine Keener and Anne Heche. Written and directed by               
Nicole Holofcener.  Opens Aug. 9.                                               
                                                                                
                           (eeee of 5 eyes)                                     
                                                                                
                                  by

The female-friendship film has been getting a bad rap since Thelma And          
Louise reinvigorated the traditional Woman's Picture six years back.            
And let's face it, with the chick flick defined by crap like Boys On            
The Side, Now And Then and Waiting To Exhale, much of the genre's               
rotten reputation is deserved. But Walking And Talking is different.            
It's good.                                                                      
                                                                                
That bland title aside, Walking And Talking is a smartly observed               
little piece of comedy-drama that manages to give a distinctly female           
perspective on love and dating without descending to Women Good, Men            
Bad stereotyping. Instead of simple-minded boy-bashing, writer-                 
director Nicole Holofcener has taken the time to create well-rounded            
characters of both sexes, then place them in a recognizable time                
(today) and milieu (New York, though any city would also do).                   
                                                                                
First and foremost among the sharply drawn characters are Laura (Anne           
Heche), a therapist, and Amelia (Catherine Keener), her lifelong g.f.           
who has a somewhat less satisfying telephone job. Amelia, resenting             
Laura's domestic bliss and impending marriage, goes on bad dates and            
lends money to her perpetually impoverished ex. Plotwise, that's about          
it -- but when the script is as fine as this one, you're already most           
of the way there.                                                               
                                                                                
Walking And Talking is the kind of movie Woody Allen -- someone with,           
shall we say, a strong interest in young people -- might make if he             
ever came down from his penthouse and took a look at how people                 
actually live nowadays. You might also think of it as what Friends              
could be if that show were about emotional entanglements rather than            
hairstyles. Too small-scale to be important, perhaps, it's nonetheless          
nicely nuanced, perfectly acted (by a cast of unknowns), and pretty             
darn charming. And, chances are, your boyfriend won't hate it, either.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><H1>Donut Alpha 4 (Web VB Interpreter)</CENTER></H1><BR><PRE>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------   
Announce: Donut Alpha 4 has been released.                                      
                                                                                
Donut is a program that allows a Visual Basic form file to be transmitted       
over the internet and viewed on a user's computer as a form.  This form will    
then interact with the user and their web browser to send or request            
information just like a normal Visual Basic program.  Donut does not require    
any Visual Basic files or DLLs in order to work.  (Donut is a hybrid of         
Visual Basic and Java.)                                                         
                                                                                
This will allow creation of web forms that give the author more control         
over exactly what the form will look like, allows interaction between the       
Donut applet and the user's browser, and allows processing of form              
information on the user's computer instead of on the server, and allows         
requesting and processing of data from a server.                                
And it allows you to use existing expertise with the very popular and common    
Visual Basic programming language to do so.                                     
                                                                                
Major inhancements for Alpha 4 include:                                         
* Correctly handle files created with either VB3.0 or VB4.0 * Load images       
  onto form (icons only for now)                                                
* Some new commands and bug fixes.                                              
                                                                                
Currently Donut is available for the Microsoft Windows operating system         
(Windows 3.x and Windows 95 or NT versions are available now; a Macintosh       
port is in progress).  It works with any Windows web browser that supports      
the standard interprocess (DDE) communication for web browsers.  It has         
been tested and works with Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer,     
and several variations of Mosaic.                                               
                                                                                
Donut should be able to run most simple Visual Basic programs with few if       
any modifications.                                                              
                                                                                
Donut is available without charge to end users.

Announcement: LiveCD V1.01 Release                                              
==================================                                              
                                                                                
LiveCD version 1.01 is now available for immediate download at the following    
web site:                                                                       
    http://livecd.ncsa.uiuc.edu   (USA)                                         
    http://livecd.iti.gov.sg      (Asia-Pacific)                                
                                                                                
What is LiveCD?                                                                 
==============                                                                  
                                                                                
LiveCD is a software development toolkit that allows existing standalone        
applications to work seamlessly with the Web.                                   
With LiveCD, developers can use already familiar PC tools to create CDROM       
applications, and then enhance it with media and data from the Web.             
Applications are not constrained within the borders of a HTML browser, and      
developers can design any kind of user interface that they fancy.               
Large multimedia files can be stored on the CDROM, and LiveCD applications      
access the Web only for dynamically changing information.                       
                                                                                
With LiveCD, the CDROM and the Web are unified.  LiveCD media can be            
seamlessly integrated with the other elements of the application, and           
they manage themselves without the user's intervention.  Hybrid LiveCD          
media gets instant notification from a LiveServer whenever the media is         
changed at the source, and they will automatically download and render          
the newly changed media.                                                        
                                                                                
Users of a LiveCD service can communicate with one another via email, fax,      
and interactive text chat.                                                      
                                                                                
The LiveCD API is extremely simple to use, and has been well tested with a      
multitude of development tools.  4 sample applications with source code or      
scripts are available for developers using MacroMind Director (Xtras            
interface), Asymetrix Multimedia Toolbook, iMedia's infoShip and Microsoft      
Visual C++ compilers.

What's new in 1.01?                                                             
==================                                                              
                                                                                
1. General fixes to the LiveServer that resulted in more reliable server        
   operation.                                                                   
                                                                                
2. General internal bug fixes to the LPLAY10.DLL and W3LIB.DLL.                 
                                                                                
3. LiveMoney application no longer crashes on startup for all computers.        
                                                                                
4. Generated 32-bit versions of the LivePlayer (LPLY1032.DLL) and the           
   W3C library (W3LIB32.DLL) DLLs.  These DLLs are specific to Windows95 or     
   NT and cannot be used on Windows 3.1 platforms.  They are functionally       
   equivalent to the 16-bit versions LPLAY10.DLL and W3LIB.DLL.                 
                                                                                
5. Extended support for Macromedia Director 5.0 Xtras.  Both 16-bit and         
   32-bit Xtras were created for using LiveCD with Director 5.0 applications.   
                                                                                
6. Added LP_SetPalette call which accepts a handle to a palette.  This sets     
   the palette of the LiveCD windows.                                           
                                                                                
7. Added 2 new connect flags:                                                   
     CONNECT_ENABLE_SILENTLOGIN - Allow login to LiveServer without popping     
                                  up Login dialog box                           
     CONNECT_DISABLE_CONNECTDLG - Do not pop up Connecting To... dialog box     
                                  while connecting.                             
                                                                                
8. Updated all the sample applications to use the 1.01 libraries.  In           
   particular, a 32-bit LiveCD front-end has been created to test the 32-bit    
   version of the LivePlayer DLL.  Also, the LiveTour sample application was    
   totally revamped to support Director 5.0 Xtras, and 16-bit and 32-bit        
   LivePlayer Xtras were developed and released together with the LiveTour      
   application.

                             Mark Dillon                                        
                                                                                
You might expect Kingpin, coming from the idiots what brung you Dumb            
And Dumber, to be the most puerile of screen comedies, a succession of          
cheap gags based on the body and its various parts and functions. And           
that's pretty much what it is.                                                  
                                                                                
But, surprisingly, it is also something more. There is a genuine sense          
of despair in the story of Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson), the 1979 Iowa          
state bowling champ who tries to make a comeback 17 years after losing          
his bowling hand in an altercation with some locals he tried to                 
hustle. But the film's occasional moments of anguish somehow do not             
get in the way of the fun.                                                      
                                                                                
Kingpin is an irreverent road movie. Roy, an alcoholic has-been,                
stumbles across Amish bowling prodigy Ishmael (Randy Quaid) at a local          
alley. He offers to manage Ish in a $1 million winner-take-all                  
tournament in Reno and split the winnings. The reluctant Ish only               
accepts so he can save his community from foreclosure. Along the way            
they pick up Claudia, a sexy hustler who's in a jam with her sadistic           
boyfriend. It is by no means a smooth ride. Roy and Claudia get into a          
hilariously stupid fight scene in which nothing below (or above) the            
belt is spared.                                                                 
                                                                                
Harrelson, who has spent too much time on and offscreen trying to               
disassociate himself from his nerdy Cheers persona, is surprisingly             
sympathetic as Roy. Likewise, Quaid is totally likable as the Amish             
man-child who picks up drinking, smoking, a couple of tattoos and a             
brief stint as a stripper on his first adventure in the outside world.          
But it is Bill Murray who steals the show in the climactic competition          
scene as nasty bowling ace "Big Ern" McCracken. His comb-over alone is          
worth the price of admission.

The Jane Austen-a-thon continues. This time it's Emma, a comedy of              
manners that plays on the tribulations of marriage in 18th-century              
English society. Emma is a 21-year-old bundle of contradictions --              
sweet and selfish, cunning and naive -- who considers herself a                 
talented matchmaker regardless of near-disastrous results.                      
                                                                                
Despite the recent spate of Austen films -- including Clueless, the             
Valley Girl spin on Emma -- there is room for yet another good                  
adaptation of this author's timeless social commentaries. By capturing          
Austen's wit and sensibility, this is one that delivers the goods.              
                                                                                
On the surface, Emma is a romantic romp through lush countryside and            
overstuffed parlors, but more interestingly, the tale winds its way             
through the thickets of new love. As Emma messes about with other               
people's lives and love affairs, she discovers that she's in love               
herself and grows up in the process.                                            
                                                                                
First-time writer/director Douglas McGrath's choice of Gwyneth Paltrow          
(recently of The Pallbearer and Seven) for the lead proves to be                
inspired: she's the perfect Emma and her British accent doesn't waver.          
As McGrath tells it in a recent phone interview from New York, someone          
recommended Paltrow, so he rented Flesh And Bone. "The thing that sold          
me on her was her fine Texan accent. I grew up in Texas and my friends          
and I used to go to the movies and kill ourselves laughing over bad             
Texan accents. But she was good. She sounded like girls I had grown up          
with." McGrath says everything else was fitting about Paltrow, from             
her smoky voice to her "posture and bearing -- all those things that            
convey the manner of the period."                                               
                                                                                
The supporting cast is a powerhouse of (mostly British) talent, many            
of them virtually unknown in Hollywood circles. Jeremy Northam as Mr.           
Knightley is the consummate dark and handsome romantic hero; Sophie             
Thompson is Miss Bates, the nervous, sweet-natured spinster whose non-          
stop babble is both pathetic and amusing. Ewan McGregor of                      
Trainspotting fame plays the flirtatious and enigmatic bachelor Frank           
Churchill, and Juliet Stevenson (Truly, Madly, Deeply) wreaks havoc as          
the marvelously bitchy Mrs. Elton. The only flaw is Toni Collette               
(Muriel's Wedding), who is a bit too goofy as the pretty,                       
impressionable Harriet Smith, whom Emma is determined to marry off to           
a suitable gentleman.                                                           
                                                                                
McGrath, a 38-year-old literary grad who used to write sketches for             
Saturday Night Live and co-wrote Bullets Over Broadway with Woody               
Allen, had his first tryst with Emma when he was 23. He was "ill-               
placed" at SNL when a fellow writer recommended he pick up the novel.           
He ploughed through, amused but not impressed until he came to a                
pivotal picnic scene that shows an uglier side to our heroine. "Up              
until that point, I thought it was fairly breezy and predictable," he           
says. "Then, all of a sudden the bottom falls out. From then on, I was          
a slave to Emma."                                                               
                                                                                
That scene on film, when Emma publicly humiliates the chronically               
vulnerable Miss Bates, is faultless: the camera lingers on an                   
indifferent Emma and her appalled guests as the wounded Miss Bates              
recoils -- anguish intrudes into this otherwise safe world.                     
                                                                                
In the winter of 1994, when McGrath sat down to write the screenplay,           
no one in movieland was interested. In Los Angeles, the "least                  
literary place in the world," he says, "people would look at me as              
though I had picked four letters from the alphabet at random" when he           
first pitched Emma.                                                             
                                                                                
Suddenly Austen became "the most popular writer in Hollywood" and               
McGrath got the green light -- with some valuable experience under his          
belt from Bullets.                                                              
                                                                                
Allen's neurotic New York and Austen's bucolic England are not exactly          
neighbors, but McGrath maintains the two authors have a fair bit in             
common.                                                                         
                                                                                
"Funnily enough, Woody's world is not all that different from Jane              
Austen's world. They both write about fairly small social circles of            
highly articulate people who, despite their gift with words, make a             
big mess of their lives." The noted exception, he says, is that there           
are no shrinks in Austen's world.                                               
                                                                                
Irreverence aside, McGrath was determined to remain as true to the              
text as possible. "I didn't consciously change anything to make it              
contemporary," he says, adding that Austen simply doesn't need it. "I           
don't have any mistaken ideas that I could write better dialogue than           
Jane Austen."                                                                   
                                                                                
Unlike his heroine, McGrath wisely respects the dangers of meddling.

Binoviewers - Enjoying the sky with TWO eyes!                                   
an equipment review, by Todd Gross                                              
8/15/96                                                                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
It sounds so simple, split the view into two beams, and turn your               
telescope into virtual binoculars! Well, in practice, it's not quite so         
simple. Binocular viewers (binoviewers) for telescopes come in several          
different styles, can throw your focus into a tizzy, and work well with         
certain eyepieces and not others. Throw into the mix different people's         
ability to "merge" two images, increased magnification due to changes in        
focal length on a Schmidt-Cassegrain scope, changes in focus when               
different people view through some units, limited clear aperture on most,       
barlow options, and various misconceptions, and you have one big mess to        
sort out!                                                                       
                                                                                
A recent article on binoviewers in a popular Astronomy magazine barely          
scratched the surface of these issues. Viewing through a binoviewer is          
just so incredibly satisfying, that I wanted to "spread the word" about         
them (as I have tried several of them) and yet clear up all the                 
misunderstandings.                                                              
                                                                                
Meanwhile, as many folks are getting into Astrophotography, and CCD             
Astronomy, I have decided to, at this point, focus my attention on the          
cutting edge of "visual" astronomy (gee, does anybody still look through        
their scopes with their EYES?) and this of course includes great eyepieces      
(such as the Naglers), great filters (such as the Lumicon UHC/OIII) and of      
course, binoviewers..... sooooo here we go:                                     
                                                                                
Let me start by telling you that looking through a really good binoviewer       
(like the Televue unit) is absolutely wonderful. Star clusters which you        
are accustomed to seeing with 10x70 binoculars as fuzzballs, are now            
"alive" and resolved, similar to the way you would view the Pleiades in a       
regular pair of binoculars. Planets seem to show more features, and nebula      
are easier to dwell on. In fact, the impression you get is exactly the          
same as looking through binoculars. You can't see 3-D in binoculars when        
looking at objects at infinity, and you can't see 3-D in binoviewers            
either, although it does have a false "3-D" effect, just like binoculars        
pointed to the sky, which is very impressive.                                   
                                                                                
EYESTRAIN RELIEF:                                                               
                                                                                
I will get to the controversial "light sharing" issue in just a moment,         
but first, let me pose this question to you: If you were told for now on,       
to only look through ONE of your eyes when using your pair of regular           
binoculars, how would you feel? Certainly you would make out almost as          
much with one eye, but how do you feeeeeel? The answer is: just plain           
uncomfortable. The main advantage of a binoviewer, has nothing to do with       
the obvious ability for two eyes to be able to perceive more than one, it       
is more the lack of eyestrain than anything else that impresses me! This        
is the key reason why I am no longer able to use my telescopes without the      
binoviewer comfortably.                                                         
                                                                                
THE LIGHT SHARING ISSUE:                                                        
                                                                                
I want to dispel the myth about not being able to use binoviewers for deep      
sky objects right off the top here. As you will read below, certain units,      
such as the Televue binoviewer, are designed to be able to be used at low       
power, with a wide clear aperture and large prisms that enable you to use       
1.25" eyepieces down to 35, 40mm without any vignetting. The most commonly      
quoted disadvantage of binoviewers (other than price!) is that they split       
the same beam of light into two beams, thus decreasing the amount of light      
you are seeing by at least 50%. While this is true on paper..... Just as        
you have an additive advantage when using binoculars over a monocular, you      
take away very little light gathering with a binoviewer, as your brain          
seems to somehow account for this split. In fact, since you are perceiving      
the image better with two eyes anyway, you end up almost where you started      
from, after splitting the beam, and then viewing with two eyes. True, I         
have measured between a 1/4 and 1/2 magnitude starlight loss in an 8"           
scope, and at first glance globulars are less resolved, indicating less         
light gathering,  but the amount of the loss seems far less than 50% in         
practice. Perhaps closer to 25%. I have written about this in detail            
before on the newsgroup sci.astro.amateur on the Internet. Try this             
experiment:                                                                     
                                                                                
In a somewhat darkened room, look at a piece of white paper while covering      
one eye with a piece of cardboard. Take away the cardboard and now view it      
with two eyes. Do this several times. Did you notice the shade of white         
seems to "brighten" a bit as you use both eyes? Do the same now with a          
regular pair of binoculars (this is additive unlike binoviewers, which          
subtract light, but it will show you the point) View a starfield with one       
eye, then two. You can make out MORE stars with two eyes! A good pair of        
70mm binoculars will give you a better view overall, light gathering wise,      
than a low power 70mm telescope of the same star field.                         
                                                                                
And then of course, two eyes can perceive more detail, which also helps to      
off-set                                                                         
the light loss.                                                                 
                                                                                
Anyway, the bottom line is that you will have a more enjoyable view, but        
*slightly* dimmer using a binoviewer. Thus on my 10" scope for instance, I      
notice that deep sky objects are not quite as bright as without the             
binoviewer, but certainly brighter than my old 8" scope without the             
binoviewer. I have effectively lost about an inch of aperture light wise,       
although this is purely subjective. I have noticed the same thing with a        
4" refractor, I am seeing more than a 3" scope, but not as much deep sky        
brightness as with the 4" scope without the viewer attached.                    
KINDS OF BINOVIEWERS:                                                           
                                                                                
There are three basic kinds of binoviewers all with different "quirks":         
                                                                                
1. Microscope-head style binoviewers (Celestron-Orion type): Adapted from       
Microscope heads, small prisms with limited clear aperture, 45 degree           
angle rather than straight through or 90 degree angle. Most will plug           
right into a 1.25" star diagonal, some like Orion's screw right onto the        
back of a Schmidt - Cassegrain scope. You can adapt Celestron's binoviewer      
to fit onto a schmidt-cassegrain like that using their standard visual          
back.                                                                           
                                                                                
The disadvantage of this binoviewer is that you cannot easily use               
eyepieces much over 18 or 20mm before you will see significant vignetting.      
The general light throughput may not be quite as good, and the 45 degree        
angle can be somewhat distracting. You cannot easily use these at all on        
reflectors.                                                                     
                                                                                
The other major disadvantage is the problem with focus shift as you adjust      
the two eyepieces (push-pull) for the different distances required for          
different sets of eyes. In fact, even with just ONE user, you sometimes         
have to change this interpupilary distance to accommodate different sets        
of eyepieces, and here again you will need to refocus every step of the         
way as you adjust the width between the eyepieces.                              
                                                                                
The advantage of this style is the price, they tend to run around               
$500-$600 or so new, and a bit less second hand. (Orion's list is $649)         
They come in and out of availability and when I checked several months          
ago, the Celestron unit was not available, the Orion unit was.                  
                                                                                
The other advantage is that on the Moon and planets at high power, you          
seem to be able to get as good performance, or just about anyway, as the        
more expensive units. Like all binoviewers, it takes a lot of focus travel      
to be able to accommodate them, see further down in this article for            
details.                                                                        
                                                                                
2. True binocular style binoviewers:                                            
The Astrophysics/Zeiss binoviewer, the ATM binoviewer, and the Televue          
Bino Vue are the only ones that I know of that fit this style.                  
Unfortunately (but fortunately for Televue) the Astrophysics is not             
currently available, and the ATM has basically become extinct as Televue        
has apparently taken over the designing of this unit (and done a great          
job). This means that the ONLY AVAILABLE HIGH QUALITY binoviewer, new, is       
the Televue unit! Now that's what I call "cornering" the market.                
                                                                                
This style of binoviewer is very expensive.. running almost $1000.00            
(includes a barlow lens with the Televue unit) I am not sure what goes          
into the production of these binoviewers, but it does seem extraordinarily      
expensive. However, the performance improvement is quite substantial...and      
worth the price.                                                                
                                                                                
The advantages of this style of binoviewer is firstly, that they are built      
just like binoculars. That is, you can adjust for the distance between          
your eyes in the same exact fashion, with no change in focus, as you            
adjust.  The less expensive pairs are more of a push-in/pull-out                
proposition, which throw off your focus as you adjust for eye distance.         
                                                                                
The second BIG advantage is that this style of binoviewer has full size         
prisms which fully illuminate 1.25" eyepieces. No vignetting is noticeable      
even at low power, or with 20-40mm focal length eyepieces. The light            
throughput also seems to be higher on these units, and makes them totally       
suitable for deep sky observing.                                                
                                                                                
The next advantage is that these units are NOT built in a 45 degree style,      
you can use these binoviewers either straight through, or utilizing a star      
diagonal. (The A/P unit has a built in diagonal, the Televue unit requires      
a 1.25" (or 2")  star diagonal). This allows you to use this type of            
binoviewer in a Newtonian reflector, which is difficult with a unit built       
at a 45 deg. angle. However, coming to focus on a Newtonian will require        
barlowing (see below, there is an exception)                                    
                                                                                
Also.. viewing straight-through on the Televue unit, and even in it's           
"diagonal" position on the Astrophysics unit, it is possible on many            
refractors to actually reach focus without introducing a barlow lens            
before this type of binoviewer. This makes it possible to enjoy truly low       
power viewing.  (more on this later, reaching focus some scopes is a snap,      
others quite difficult)                                                         
                                                                                
3. The Russian alternative, right in between:                                   
There is a unit on the market (name?) available from Earth and Sky              
Adventure Products that falls right in between the first two alternatives.      
Featuring a binocular style that will not lose focus as you adjust for the      
width between your eyes, they appear to have somewhat more clear aperture       
than the cheaper units, but less than the more expensive ones. These are        
45-degree style binoviewers, and other than their lack of inter-ocular          
focus problems, are more similar to the Celestron type binoviewers than         
the Televue type. Planetary and lunar images were as sharp (but not as          
bright) when tested head to head with Televue's binoviewer. In it's most        
usual position, you should be aware that the unit appeared "upside down",       
which did not affect the view, but just took a bit of getting used to.          
                                                                                
"MERGING" THE IMAGES:                                                           
                                                                                
The way binoculars, and binoviewers work, is to collimate each side             
perfectly with each other, so that your eyes can "merge" the two images         
into one. Some people, it turns out, do this more readily than others.          
High power eyepieces make it more difficult to merge images, than low           
power ones, as explained later.                                                 
                                                                                
COMING TO FOCUS WITH YOUR BINOVIEWER, and BARLOWING:                            
                                                                                
Perhaps the greatest inconvenience in using a binoviewer, is that it            
requires that you rack your focus way in to account for the extra travel        
path of the light to reach your eyepieces. In fact, on most scopes, you         
simply CANNOT reach focus without using a barlow ahead of the binoviewer,       
to counteract this. That doesn't sound like a big problem at first, but         
because the distance is also greater between that barlow, and the               
eyepieces after travelling through the binoviewer itself, the barlowing is      
"magnified" to somewhere between 3 and 4 times, on a regular 2X barlow!         
For some scopes, this will strap you to such high power, that wide field        
and low-medium power viewing is impossible. There are several exceptions,       
and tricks to help dodge this issue:                                            
                                                                                
1. On many refractors, the (no-longer-available) Astrophysics/Zeiss             
binoviewer will come to focus w/o a barlow. I am not sure about                 
reflectors. There seems to be less focus travel required for this unit,         
perhaps because of the special color-correcting lens that comes with it.        
                                                                                
2. On many refractors (but probably not many reflectors) the Televue            
binoviewer will come to focus w/o a barlow if used "straight through", and      
not in a star diagonal. Inconvenient, but it works.                             
                                                                                
3. Reflectors have, and can be custom made or re-configured to come to          
focus with a binoviewer                                                         
                                                                                
4. Cadiatropic scopes such as Schmidt Cassegrain that come to focus by          
moving the primary mirror will likely have no problem coming to focus with      
a binoviewer... in most configurations.                                         
                                                                                
5. You can use a lower power barlow to try to minimize the magnification.       
A 1.8X Televue or a 1.5X 2" Vernonscope Barlow (called 2X barlow, but that      
is when it is used ahead of a star diagonal, in reality it is 1.5X) will        
help.                                                                           
                                                                                
Even with all of the above, finding the exact focus position that works         
with your scope mated to your binoviewer with, or without a barlow can be       
a bit tricky.  With that in mind, the Televue binoviewer and it's               
accompanying barlow have been designed to be almost exactly parfocal with       
your normal focus position, but at the expense of approximately 3.8X            
magnification.                                                                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
The SCHMIDT-CASSEGRAIN ENIGMA:                                                  
                                                                                
The most versatile scopes to use a binoviewer with are the standard             
Schmidt-Cassegrain scopes such as those widely available from Celestron or      
Meade. The reason is that the primary mirror is shifted forward and back        
to reach focus, allowing a very wide latitude of focus adjustment, which        
is exactly what these lengthy units require.                                    
                                                                                
However, whenever I looked through my LX200, S-C scope with a binoviewer,       
I could swear that I was much more magnified than when viewing with a           
regular star diagonal and the same eyepiece. I couldn't, at first, figure       
out why. It turned out that indeed the Astrophysics unit I was using            
included a special correcting lens which boosted magnification by 20%.          
However, I still noticed a 15-20% increase in magnification on my Televue       
binoviewer when using the LX200, but NOT while using a refractor. The           
reason, of course, turned out to be the change in focus position. It turns      
out that whenever you re-focus most schmidt - cassegrain scopes, you are        
moving the main mirror, and because of the shape of the secondary mirror,       
you are changing your focal length a little bit. However, the primary has       
to be moved in so much to compensate for the length of the binoviewer,          
that on a 10" f/6.3 scope, I was seeing 15-20% growth in apparent focal         
length. (This supposedly does throw a bit of spherical aberration into the      
mix as well, as S-C scopes are designed so that only ONE focus position         
holds the minimum spherical aberration for the scope, but this is               
unraveling a whole different topic, and I could not detect a difference in      
image quality)                                                                  
                                                                                
The bottom line, is that with a C8 as an example, running at f/10, you may      
very well find it harder to reach low enough power for many objects even        
without barlowing. Why? Well first off, you are limited to 1.25"                
eyepieces, so a 32mm 50 degree field eyepiece is about as wide as you can       
get. With your now increased focal length, the eyepiece is going to act         
more like 27mm or so. (comparing it to without the binoviewer.) The             
problem gets even worse at 10" f/10, and 12" f/10, etc, which already are       
limited in their wide fields without 2" eyepieces. Making the problem even      
worse, is that you cannot compensate this by throwing on a  f/6.3               
reducer-corrector, as that unit requires you to bring in your mirror            
substantially to reach focus, and therefore you cannot reach focus using a      
binoviewer PLUS a reducer corrector.                                            
                                                                                
I guess, what I am leading up to, is that it is best to go with an f/6.3        
scope if possible if you are planning to use the binoviewer for medium-low      
power, and wide field viewing. You may find yourself kind of boxed in at        
high power with an f/10 scope.                                                  
                                                                                
CHOOSING EYEPIECES FOR YOUR BINOVIEWER:                                         
                                                                                
Selecting eyepieces for your binoviewer is a tricky proposition. The first      
problem you will immediately stumble into is the price! You have to match       
eyepieces EXACTLY, and double up on your supply. You can use your barlow        
to reduce the number of eyepieces, but the doubles can run into some            
serious money.                                                                  
                                                                                
The second problem, I have run into several times, and you will not             
realize it until it is too late... eyepiece designs change with time, and       
you have to match the exact STYLE of that eyepiece! For instance... both        
the Meade Superwides and the Televue Naglers have undergone design changes      
in the last few years..in fact, the Naglers have undergone 3 or 4 design        
changes, the latest of which brings the top lens flush with the top of the      
eyepiece. You MUST match exact designs, so buying eyepieces second hand         
becomes very risky when putting pairs together.                                 
                                                                                
The third problem is also obvious.. size and weight. If the eyepiece is         
over 50mm wide, you will start running into problems with them being too        
large to use, and if they are too heavy, they weigh your scope down,            
throwing off balance. The 22mm Panoptics are the largest possible               
eyepieces to use in practice in most cases with these binoviewers (but the      
weight may still deter you.) The 22mm Panoptics, by the way, offer an           
unbelievable wide field view, with good eye relief, akin to the most            
expensive binoculars on the market.                                             
                                                                                
The fourth problem is selecting eyepieces carefully with consideration to       
eye relief. If the eye relief is too long, then holding the view becomes        
even harder when you attempt this with two eyes. 35mm-40mm eyepieces            
typically exhibit this problem. Eye relief that is too short, also becomes      
just a bit more bothersome than normal with a binoviewer. Mid-range             
eyepieces in the 10-25mm category usually work out just fine in terms of        
eye relief.                                                                     
                                                                                
The fifth problem is the field size. Unfortunately, you can comfortably         
only take in about 60-65 degrees of apparent field before having to             
seriously shift your head around. This means that on the 7 and 9mm              
Naglers, for instance, you will sacrifice some field when using the             
binoviewer.                                                                     
                                                                                
The sixth problem has to do with high power eyepieces. Turns out that the       
lower the focal length of the eyepiece, the harder it is for the brain to       
"merge" images. The critical alignment of each side of the binoviewer can       
be best maintained with eyepieces of 10mm focal length or higher. I was         
NOT able to merge images on a pair of 4mm Vixen Lanthanums as an example!       
Some people merge images more easily than others.                               
                                                                                
As an aid, in your selection, here is a sample of some of the eyepiece          
pairs that I have tried:                                                        
                                                                                
35mm Celestron ultimas: Widest possible field, however, hard to hold the        
view.                                                                           
                                                                                
24.5mm Meade Superwides: Almost the widest possible field, very                 
comfortable view                                                                
                                                                                
22mm Panoptics: Incredible wide field views. Very comfortable eye relief.       
The problem with this eyepiece is that for children it may be too large,        
(their eyes are closer) and the weight is a real problem for many scopes.       
                                                                                
18mm Meade Superwides: Wonderful in all ways                                    
                                                                                
17mm Orion Sirius Plossls: Excellent viewing                                    
                                                                                
16mm, and 12mm Naglers: Quite large and heavy, can't take in the whole          
field. Not that good, especially for folks with eyes that are closer.           
                                                                                
13.8 Meade Superwides: Very good, just a bit tight on eye relief. Fogged        
easily.                                                                         
                                                                                
12.5 Celestron Ultimas: Nearly perfect, plus the "horn" style eyecups work      
well with binoviewing                                                           
                                                                                
10mm Zeiss Orthos, .965, 1.25" adapter: Good view, but too short on eye         
relief in my opinion for comfortable binoviewing                                
                                                                                
9mm Vixen Lanthanums: Very good, although the eye relief is actually a bit      
"long" for binoviewing, and the view is just a tad hard to hold..but this       
is minimal.                                                                     
                                                                                
9mm Naglers: A bit on the heavy side, and it is very hard to take in the        
whole view, about 70 apparent degrees realistically. The eye relief is a        
bit short too. Still a good view.                                               
                                                                                
7mm Naglers: More comfortable than the 9mm Naglers by far, but still just       
a bit short on eye relief, making it even harder to take in the whole           
view.                                                                           
                                                                                
I am currently in the process of trying to put together 3 more pairs            
including Takahashi LE eyepieces, Orion Ultrascopic, and the formidable         
Docter Vario Zoom eyepieces. (The latter may be too heavy and large)            
                                                                                
As with single eyepieces, eye relief of over 13mm or so is necessary when       
using glasses.                                                                  
                                                                                
BINOVIEWERS ON PLANETS & THE MOON                                               
                                                                                
As already hinted, the traditional use of binoviewers has been on the Moon      
and planets The less expensive binoviewer adapted from microscope heads,        
works just fine on them. There is a two, or even threefold benefit from         
using a binoviewer on these brighter objects.                                   
                                                                                
a. Even though the amount of light that you "perceive" is not reduced           
greatly, the splitting of the beam into TWO eyes results in a less glaring      
object, especially on the Moon.                                                 
                                                                                
b. Two eyes can perceive more detail than one. If you ever took an eye          
exam, you know this is a fact, you can read the fine print easier with two      
eyes.                                                                           
                                                                                
c. The most important difference is the comfort factor. Eyestrain becomes       
a non-issue, and it allows you the time, and relaxation if you are seated       
comfortably (and no mosquitoes are biting you) to really pick up on detail      
that you would have otherwise missed. This is the definitely the most           
important difference to me.                                                     
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
BINOVIEWERS ON DEEP SKY:                                                        
                                                                                
Deep sky viewing can be achieved on all binoviewers, but best results,          
especially at lower power is with the more expensive units. Here are some       
of the wonders I have observed using both eyes:                                 
                                                                                
a. Firstly, like planetary and lunar viewing, objects take on a false, but      
very truly awesome three dimensional look. Although this effect struck me       
strongest when first using a binoviewer, as the moons of Jupiter appeared       
to pop out at me, I also have found that this takes place while viewing         
nebula. Star clusters seem to have some dimension, and are much, much more      
interesting.                                                                    
                                                                                
b. Galaxies, and nebula become something that you WANT to dwell on.             
Passing over them for another object becomes less appealing.  Brighter          
nebula are particularly fascinating. I picked out intricacies on the Orion      
nebula that I would never had normally looked for...and really studied the      
subtle blue-green color differences within the nebula.                          
The lack of eyestrain makes this possible.                                      
                                                                                
c. Globular clusters at first glance are a bit less resolved than using a       
single eyepiece.... however, they seem to throw a punch right out at you        
like you have never seen before  when you do the right things.                  
                                                                                
     1. Get the magnification up, for better resolution                         
     2. Use a scope with more aperture (10" or larger)                          
     3. Darkest skies, and higher dark adaptation help a lot.                   
                                                                                
Unfortunately, the view is so great breaking up globulars with two eye          
vision, that it leads to the worst possible case of aperture fever, as          
greater aperture allows you, in general to resolve globulars much more          
than smaller aperture.                                                          
                                                                                
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:                                                           
                                                                                
Optically, in terms of quality, I found that on all units that I tried          
(the Celestron Binoviewer, the Televue Binoviewer, the Astrophysics             
Binoviewer and The Russian Binoviewer,  views were equal to or better than      
single eyepieces on the Moon and planets. The more expensive units such as      
Televue's also showed no aberrations on stars and deep sky. Apparently the      
special correcting lens in the Astrophysics unit also was responsible for       
color correcting, and holding aberrations down. (Televue indicated that         
this was not necessary on theirs). I did notice however, that with certain      
eyepiece/barlow combinations, that annoying reflections, almost like ghost      
images, showed up nearby bright objects such as Jupiter. I noticed this on      
the Televue and Astrophysics binoviewers most, especially the                   
Astrophysics.                                                                   
                                                                                
At highest magnification, on a large scope, in a side to side test, one         
user did report to me that the Astrophysics unit held up the best on            
planets (we are talking about 600 to 800x here) However, in all fairness,       
this could have been a fluke, as I could not verify this.                       
                                                                                
Finally, the weight of the binoviewers, even with small eyepieces, will         
require that you think about appropriate ways to counterbalance you scope.      
                                                                                
SUMMARY:                                                                        
                                                                                
As the word about dual eye viewing spreads, more amateur observers are          
getting in the act. With the growing number of large binocular telescopes       
being built by amateurs each year, it is only a matter of time before they      
become more commercially available. Yet, one has to wonder if there is an       
easier way to view the sky with two eyes, than to use and/or pay for a          
dual-telescope system. For instance, a binoviewer utilized on a 12" scope       
will likely yield views equal to,or perhaps even better than two 8" scopes      
combined as a binocular. Put in that perspective, the price of a really         
good binoviewer may be well worth it.                                           
                                                                                
If you want to feel like you are flying over the moon, more easily observe      
the festoons of Jupiter, or to be "wowed" by a seemingly 3-dimensional          
Wild Duck Cluster (M11), with some careful consideration and planning, you      
too can turn both eyes to the sky through your scope, instead of just a         
lonely one.

I must tell you there was a time, that there was life ... then, the             
white man came." The middle bits of these liner notes, from Dick                
Dale's new hurricane of an album, Calling Up Spirits, are about how             
the imperialist pig-dog of a white man brought the evils of sickness            
and capitalism (and what, pray, about intoxicants?) to the natives,             
who were otherwise in a constant state of harmony with the universe             
(when they weren't busy scalping each other).                                   
                                                                                
Perhaps there's a reason the man, the myth, the legend -- the surf              
king! -- Dick Dale has stuck to instrumentals. Actually, there is. But          
not to avoid political rantings on oppression. Apparently, he did not           
want to take away from the intensity of the surfing feel with such              
trivial things as lyrics. Since the 1961 single "Let's Go Trippin',"            
his double-picking, heavily reverbed instrumentals -- pick slides and           
war whoops aplenty -- have been his signature.                                  
                                                                                
Well, it's 1996 and things haven't changed much. For an old guy Dale            
sure rocks. Especially for an old guy who uses telephone cables for             
guitar strings. The disc begins the tidal wave of a ride with the               
velocitous sonic beast "Nitrus" and keeps up the pace until a not-so-           
steamy cover of "Fever." Then there's a little outlaw in "Doom Box,"            
the cowboys-and-Indians feel that foreshadows the spiritual crisis (or          
perhaps it's a rant) called "Window."                                           
                                                                                
Two other covers are not in typical Dale style -- a veritably poppy             
version of "Peppermint Man" and the innocuous retribution of "Third             
Stone From The Sun" (In the original Hendrix sang, "You'll never hear           
surf music again," whereas in the new intro Dale boasts that while              
Jimi is dead, Dick is not). The rest of it is, well, just what you'd            
expect.                                                                         
                                                                                
What else can I say? Dick Dale is Dick Dale is Dick Dale. And his only          
claim to fame is not his cameo role on 90210. Nor a sound credit in a           
Quentin Tarantino film. He is the King. (Sorry, big fat dead white              
guy.)

     Amazing Images of Ganymede And a Magnetosphere, Too!                       
                                                                                
     July 9, 1996. After a wait of nearly 7 years since the October             
     1989 launch, the moment had finally arrived. Project Manager Bill          
     O'Neil stood tall before the assembled Galileo Project Team to             
     say, "The results coming in from the Ganymede encounter are                
     remarkable-absolutely stunning. And you are the people who made it         
     all happen!" It truly is an amazing story of exciting scientific           
     discoveries at Ganymede and the Project Galileo teamwork that made         
     the excellent data return a reality.                                       
                                                                                
     Scientists Rejoice Over Wealth of Data Returned                            
                                                                                
     The Geology.=20                                                            
                                                                                
     Voyager images, useful in selecting sites   =20                            
     for close-up observations by Galileo's camera, the                         
     solid-state imaging (SSI) subsystem, had indicated a rather smooth         
     surface at the pale-colored Uruk Sulcus region (the size of the            
     Los Angeles basin), resurfaced by "lava" from volcanoes of ice.            
     Not so. The first images recovered, taken 7,448 km (4,628 mi) from         
     Ganymede, show prominent ice mountains and ridges that appear to           
     have been graded by a giant rake. Jim Head, Brown Univer-sity              
     researcher and member of the Science Imaging Team, said,                   
     "Icequakes" may be responsible for the "faults pulling apart like          
     dominoes." Images of Galileo Regio, one of the darker regions,             
     also offered a surprise. The numerous bumps and hills are counter          
     to the expected fault-induced depressions. "These images have              
     turned our previous thinking upside down."                                 
                                                                                
     One area seemed to be similar to the San Andreas Fault; analysis           
     may lead scientists to a better understanding of California                
     earthquakes. (Note the fault across the center of the image, page          
     1.) The closest approach images taken at an altitude of 835 km             
     (519 mi) and those of the second pass by Ganymede (250-km                  
     altitude) in September will further aid the study of the                   
     geological history and processes at work.                                  
                                                                                
     Dr. Head also pondered the possibility of fine skiing down the             
     steep mountainsides in a land where winter never ends-but warned           
     against the hazards of falling on ice hardened like rock in the            
     100 K (-280=B0F) temperatures!                                             
                                                                                
     A Baby Magnetosphere.=20                                                   
                                                                                
     The surprising discovery of a magnetosphere                                
     within Jupiter's magnetosphere was made by both the PWS (plasma            
     wave spectrometer), which measures variations in electromagnetic           
     waves, and the MAG (magnetometer), which measures the strength and         
     direction of magnetic fields. Indications that Ganymede has a thin         
     ionosphere suggest that the moon has a tenuous atmosphere as well.         
     Margaret Kivelson, Principal Investigator for the magnetometer,            
     speculated that the other Galilean moons may also have                     
     magnetospheres.                                                            
                                                                                
     While some scientists are hard at work analyzing the new data              
     arriving daily, others wait for tape playback. Since those first           
     surprising images of Ganymede, we now have Io images (taken at             
     Voyager distances) showing dramatic changes, resulting from                
     volcanic activity, as well as images of the Great Red Spot on the          
     giant planet itself. Observations by the other instruments aboard          
     the Orbiter are still to come. Even while much is revealed about           
     Ganymede and other features of the Jovian system, more mysteries           
     surface.                                                                   
                                                                                
     Teamwork Rescues Mission - How Galileo Solved Its Problems                 
                                                                                
     The troubles began in April 1991 when the high-gain antenna                
     refused to obey the command to open all the way. The general               
     public consensus was, "Give them a few days and JPL will work its          
     magic. No problem." Insiders realized that data trickling through          
     the LGA (low-gain antenna) at 10 bps (you may have a 28,800 bps            
     modem at home) would impact the mission drastically. Consider that         
     to radio to Earth the playback of one full tape from one moon              
     encounter would take about 24 hours per day for 3 years. It would          
     take 2 weeks to return one SSI image with the necessary                    
     engineering and navigation data. With only the 10-bps downlink,            
     the mission would probably have ended with just the Jupiter orbit          
     insertion and probe data recovery returned to Earth. "It was a             
     bleak picture," Tal Brady, CDS cognizant programmer, confided.             
                                                                                
     Les Deutsch, of the Telecommunications and Missions Operations             
     Directorate, thought something could be done by reprogramming the          
     onboard computer to do image compression and also by enhancing             
     downlink telemetry encoding-in case the high-gain antenna never            
     did open. He led a group of Deep Space Network (DSN) and Galileo           
     people in a feasibility check. Then Jim Marr and Deutsch                   
     co-chaired a nearly 3-month development of the design concept,             
     fleshing out the details of what was to be done on the ground and          
     aboard the spacecraft.                                                     
                                                                                
     After NASA preapproval in 1992, implementation of the design now           
     known as "Phase 2" got under way in March 1993 under the                   
     leadership of Marr (Project Galileo) and Joe Statman (Deep Space           
     Network). Bob Gershman, Bob Barry, Tal Brady, and others began to          
     write the requirements. The race was on to beat the clock and be           
     ready in time for the Orbital Tour.                                        
                                                                                
     The Challenge on the Spacecraft Side.=20                                   
                                                                                
     The Command and Data                                                       
     Subsystem (CDS), the main computer aboard Galileo, has six 8-bit           
     microprocessors (each like an Apple 2) of 1970s vintage with a             
     total memory of 384 kilobytes. The Attitude and Articulation               
     Control Subsystem (AACS) has a faster 16-bit computer, but only 64         
     kilobytes of memory-nearly all of which needed to remain                   
     unchanged. Most of the science instruments have a single                   
     microprocessor, similar to the ones in the CDS, but with very              
     limited memory. The constraints of memory, processing time, and            
     data bus traffic were excruciating.                                        
                                                                                
     Tal Brady, architect of the Phase 2 CDS software, led the                  
     implementation effort. He was at the center of the whirlwind of            
     activities: writing code, testing, negotiating with the science            
     teams to meet their needs as much as possible-not to mention the           
     difficulty in finding programmers still fluent in the out-of-date          
     assembly language required for the CDS operating system.                   
                                                                                
     To make the huge volume of data collected by the Galileo                   
     instruments and engineering systems fit into the narrow downlink           
     "data pipe" available through the low-gain antenna, several things         
     were done onboard the spacecraft. "A science virtual machine (SVM)         
     was created and integrated into the existing operating system to           
     support editing, compression, and packetization of the science             
     data, deleting about 30 percent of the old system," explained Erik         
     Nilsen, Deputy Team Chief of the Orbiter Engineering Team. Eighty          
     kilobytes of memory were used to create a multi-use buffer (MUB)           
     within the SVM for intermediate storage of data awaiting                   
     downlinking to Earth.                                                      
                                                                                
     The science data are collected and processed at high speeds                
     relative to the data pipe speeds. Because data are not sent to             
     Earth in the order collected, the new software makes data packets          
     with headers that identify the data type, size, and collection             
     time. Before being put into playback packets, the imaging data are         
     compressed by about 15 to 1 after being played back from the tape          
     in small increments from earlier recording periods. The fields and         
     particles data are edited drastically (about 100 to 1) as the data         
     are collected and placed into real-time packets. The packets are           
     then encoded prior to downlink so that ground software can detect          
     and correct transmission errors-critical when using data                   
     compression. While improving the way the CDS could control and             
     refine data, the team looked for compression technology expertise.         
                                                                                
     A researcher at JPL, Kar-Ming Cheung, responded by defining and            
     developing the compression algorithm for the AACS. Cheung is               
     accustomed to working with complex, cutting-edge technology but            
     flexible deadlines. He commented, "Algorithms needed to fit the            
     constraints of Galileo flying old hardware were a major challenge          
     and sometimes seemed not feasible, but new ideas got it working."          
     He found the people on Galileo helpful and admired their                   
     organization where "constricting boundaries don't exist." His              
     implementation of integer cosine transform (ICT) algorithms                
     compressed the SSI images and PWS low-rate data. David Breda of            
     Attitude Control did the hard work of making the ICT algorithm fit         
     within the capabilities of the AACS.                                       
                                                                                
     Seven of the eleven science instrument teams rewrote the software          
     for their instruments onboard the spacecraft. (The other                   
     instruments lacked memory or could not be reprogrammed.)                   
                                                                                
     Integration of effort was essential for this Phase 2 task that             
     required so many different talents. Bob Gershman, Deputy Manager           
     of the Science and Sequence Office until this spring, served as            
     the mission planning liaison between scientists and design                 
     engineers so that resources were not oversubscribed. The team used         
     every innovation they could think of to refine, compress, and              
     package the data so that only the most valuable information                
     entered that slim pipeline to Earth.                                       
                                                                                
     The Challenge on the DSN Side.=20                                          
                                                                                
     The signal from the       =20                                              
     spacecraft has about the power of the 20-watt lightbulb                    
     in your refrigerator. Here on Earth, the 70-meter antenna at a DSN         
     site-listening to the signal from the low-gain spacecraft                  
     antenna-must extract miniscule power, about 10-20 or                       
     0.000 000 000 000 000 000 01 watt from a noisy background.                 
                                                                                
     Through improvements on the ground and data editing and                    
     compression onboard, the effective information rate was increased          
     by a factor of about 100. Joe Statman, who led the DSN S-Band              
     Team, commented on "the fabulous cooperation between spacecraft            
     and ground teams during development and end-to-end testing" that           
     began in 1993, 2 years before arrival at Jupiter. Superior                 
     software enables the station to maintain lock while changing data          
     rate in several steps. The receiving rate of the spacecraft signal         
     can vary from as low as 8-32 bps at the horizon to as high as              
     80-160 bps at the zenith (when directly overhead of the antenna).          
     New receivers, enhanced S-Band reception (the ultracone), and the          
     arraying of multiple antennas (to be completed by November) all            
     contribute to the capability of receiving these tiny signals from          
     the spacecraft.                                                            
                                                                                
     It was a lot of work. Early in 1995, the S-Band Team, led by Dean          
     Hardi, started installing the equipment in DSN stations and                
     testing it around the clock as the spacecraft sped toward Jupiter.         
                                                                                
     The Challenge for Ground Systems.=20                                       
                                                                                
     Data from the DSN is further                                               
     processed by the Ground Systems Office for analysis by the                 
     scientists. "It was the most professionally challenging thing I            
     ever did!" said Betsy Wilson, Ground Systems Telemetry Engineer.           
     She had interfaced with the CDS people to negotiate the structure          
     of the telemetry at bit-level, specifying processing requirements          
     for ground systems. "The amazing software people conceived of so           
     much to be done with so little," Wilson remarked. Project-specific         
     ground system software for both commanding and receiving                   
     telemetry, the Multimission Ground Data System (MGDS), and the             
     Multimission Image Processing Laboratory (MIPS) software all had           
     to be modified extensively to support the new spacecraft software.         
                                                                                
     Testing Logjam.=20                                                         
                                                                                
     You can imagine that, with a multitude of complex                          
     changes, rigorous end-to-end testing was essential. Greg Levanas           
     developed tools to simulate the data output from the instruments,          
     to feed that data to the CDS, to process the data coming out of            
     the CDS, and to validate every bit of that telemetry. The Project          
     had a testbed for systems testing conducted on the same type of            
     hardware as that aboard the spacecraft. Much was accomplished              
     there, but it could not begin to handle the full load of traffic           
     for all the pieces of software to be verified.                             
                                                                                
     Enter FASTSIM.=20                                                          
                                                                                
     Mohammed Shahabuddin, cognizant engineer for                               
     Galileo FASTSIM, explained that this powerful tool is software             
     that simulates the CDS and AACS hardware. With the development of          
     FASTSIM, software developers could simulate the computers aboard           
     Galileo to test code at their own Sun workstations. Work proceeded         
     at a dramatically increased rate.                                          
                                                                                
     Wonderful "Interruptions."=20                                              
                                                                                
     Enroute science opportunities added to                                     
     the "fun" during the intense activities of the Phase 2 period.             
     First the asteroid Gaspra, then Ida with its moon, and finally the         
     dramatic sighting of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 smashing into Jupiter          
     vied for attention. Precious time was spent capturing the data for         
     these unique events. The clock kept on ticking.                            
                                                                                
     October 1995-Almost Done And . . . Oh, No! The tape recorder did           
     not respond to commands. Was it broken? Fortunately, no.                   
                                                                                
     Project Galileo was depending on it for the orbital tour. No one           
     had ever heard of this problem! And so after much study in the             
     testbed, the team began software development for Phase 2A. Their           
     fix for the tape recorder was to unstick the tape by carefully             
     pulling it forward a bit at the start of each tape motion, and             
     then checking to make sure that the tape was moving. The steady            
     flow of images from Galileo confirms the success of this                   
     procedure.                                                                 
                                                                                
     Would It Work?=20                                                          
                                                                                
     Yes! But no one knew that on May 23, 1996, when the                        
     science virtual machine was turned on to begin the process of              
     switching the spacecraft to the new format for Phase 2/2A. The             
     first clue that all was well came with the arrival of the PWS              
     real-time science data at the Multimission Image Processing                
     Laboratory. Cheers!                                                        
                                                                                
     Another tense moment came on June 3 as the Optical      =20                
     Navigation Team waited eagerly for delivery of an image                    
     of Ganymede and the associated star that would aid in targeting            
     the encounter. Ed Riedel and Steve Synnott had developed an                
     algorithm to find the body and look for the star. The image was            
     highly edited so that only the essential information was captured          
     and processed.                                                             
                                                                                
     Yes, the body had been located. Would the algorithm find the star?         
     More data. . . . Quickly, Carol Stanley assembled the data to form         
     a picture, and there was the star-right smack in the center of the         
     data block. Success!                                                       
                                                                                
     Al Nikora, who as CDS analyst defined commands for the upload,             
     voiced the excitement that many express about the Phase 2/2A task,         
     "It's a nice treat to have an opportunity to do a job like this.           
     And to see it work. The science data are coming down and the               
     scientists seem to be happy with it."                                      
                                                                                
     "It was a superb job," Marr said. The limited downlink forced a            
     drastically downsized allocation of science data. As the difficult         
     trades were made, "the level of communication between science              
     instruments people and those for the other systems, all working in         
     parallel, was outstanding!"                                                
                                                                                
     We owe the success of the Phase 2/2A software and associated               
     hardware changes to the many smart, innovative, committed team             
     players who worked extremely well together across organizational           
     lines. Faced with a daunting task, their "we can do it" attitude           
     inspires us all with courage to meet the challenges ahead.                 
                                                                                
     Now the scientists rejoice, the Project Manager rejoices, and the          
     team who had whispered to themselves, "I wonder if we can," then           
     "I think we can," now says "We did it!"                                    
                                                                                
     To all the team members, many more than are mentioned here: Bravo!         
     This is fantastic!                                                         
                                                                                
     It's your data, and I think you can be very proud of it."

We've just released NetPopup 2.22.                                              
                                                                                
NetPopup is a realtime way to send messages in Internet or                      
TCP/IP-network. Messages are sent directly, using multithreading,               
to other computer(s) without an e-mail server.                                  
                                                                                
NetPopup is a solution for WindowsNT-users who want to send                     
messages in realtime to Win95-clients or other NT workstations.                 
Basicly NetPopup is Winpopup on Internet but  it works both in

System administrator can broadcast messages upto 250 users

Since most Internet users has dynamic IP-address, NetPopup has                  
built-in  feature, Seeker ,which allows you to easily search other              
NetPopups from the net.                                                         
                                                                                
Version 2.22 has Connection Wizard to help send your                            
IP-address or messages via e-mail to your friend(s).                            
                                                                                
With new version you can send messages to NetPopup                              
with commandline tool from your own programs or batch-files.                    
This is ideally for automaticly send or broadcast messages to                   
users if  server is coming down or there's some other problems on the           
net.

       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT STAR TREK DATES AND YEARS               
                                                                                
This FAQL is basically a list of  questions that  have been  brought up and     
discussed to death in rec.arts.startrek.misc, and a lot of  people would be     
happy if  they never  resurfaced.   Please refer  to the  "LIST OF PERIODIC

ings, and to the "LIST OF ACRONYMS" article for  acronyms used  in this and     
other postings.

1) STARDATES, YEARS, AGES, ETC.:                                                
                                                                                
In TOS the stardates ranged from 1513 (Man Trap) to 5928 (Turnabout             
Intruder).  At this time Gene had intended for stardates to be based on         
Julian dates modulo 10000, with one stardate being 24 hours in length.          
There are numerous examples where this is false.  Some of the most blatant      
are The Immunity Syndrome (where a quick calculation shows that one             
stardate is less than 2.5 hours) and Requiem for Methuselah (where one          
stardate figures out to be about 960 hours).  There are a few episodes          
where the stardates actually decrease during the show.                          
                                                                                
In TNG, the stardate is also supposed to be 24 hours, and is in the form        
4xyyy.y where "x" is the season number and yyy.y is a random number that        
increases (usually) throughout the season.                                      
                                                                                
---------------------------------------------------------------------------     
2) YEARS:                                                                       
                                                                                
There are a few timelines (quite detailed) that get posted to r.a.s             
occasionally (version 4 of The Chronology File is among the most detailed       
and complete).  They take all the info from canonical sources and use as        
much as they can without conflicting too much (usually only having to throw     
out two or three references).  The following is a list of the mentions that     
get asked the most in RAS:

be retiring.  :-)                                                               
                                                                                
The season 1 Writer's Guide gives Picard's age as 55, which is off by five      
years from the other data (which is on film--therefore "canon").                
                                                                                
"The Schizoid Man":  Wes said "Data, chronologically, you're not much older     
than I am."                                                                     
                                                                                
"DataLore":  Data says he was found 26 years ago.                               
                                                                                
"Redemption II":  Data says he has 26 years of StarFleet training.              
                                                                                
"Datalore":  Data details exactly how many years he spent at the Academy,       
how many as an ensign, etc.  Counting backwards from stardate 41xxx.x would     
give his grad date.                                                             
                                                                                
"Encounter at Farpoint":  Data graduated SFA in the class of '78 with           
Honors in Dextral Biology (Exobiology?)  and Probability Mechanics.             
                                                                                
"Data's Day":  Data states that it is the 1,5__th day of the Enterprise's       
commission.                                                                     
                                                                                
According to Beverly's birthday given in "Conundrum" and the year given by      
Data in "The Neutral Zone" (and guessing Wesley's age to be around 15 at        
that time), Beverly gave birth to Wes when she was about 15 years old.          
                                                                                
The book "The Final Reflection" (non-canon, but who really cares) puts the      
lifespan of a Klingon at about 40 years (terran).  Worf would be about 15,      
by this reckoning.                                                              
                                                                                
According to the "Star Trek Chronology", when Enterprise was commissioned       
in 2364:  Picard 59 yr old; Beverly Crusher 40; Riker 29; La Forge 29; Troi     
28; Yar 27; Worf 24.

                             A&M/PolyGram                                       
                                                                                
                                  by                                            
                             EMILY SMITH                                        
                                                                                
Several people have told me that they think this record is dull and             
that it, well, sucks. Perhaps I have gone soft in the head, but I               
think with Turn Me On the Doughboys have out-shine-d themselves. Here           
are 10 reasons why it is a good record:                                         
                                                                                
1. Borrowing equally from Rusty (tuneful rockingness) and Groovy                
Religion (grooviness!), the Doughboys have created some catchy-as-hell          
pop tunes. Bonus points for inspiration based on Canadian content.              
                                                                                
2. Titles such as "I Never Liked You" are immediately attractive.               
Apparently that song is based on a book by Chester Brown. This means            
the 'boys can read. Literacy is good.                                           
                                                                                
3. I really liked the way the chorus riff for "Lucky" was slyly nicked          
from the Pistols' "No Feelings."                                                
                                                                                
4. Some of the more atmospheric psychedelic numbers, including the              
lovely "Everything And After," are pleasingly like Primal Scream circa          
Sonic Flower Groove.                                                            
                                                                                
5. Several songs have really cool, big, spooky drum beats recalling             
The Cure's Pornography.                                                         
                                                                                
6. There may be enough wistful, psychedelic items on the agenda that            
Turn Me On will appeal to a wider audience than just college boys who           
like to rock out to Buffalo Tom.                                                
                                                                                
7. All the songs have a happy, poppy feel even when they are                    
melancholy. See Emily dance (klunk!).                                           
                                                                                
8. Beautiful, honeyed vocals and swirly, jangling guitar aplenty.               
                                                                                
9. They have never stolen anything from me, so they must be nice. And           
we all know that niceness counts a whole bunch toward musical ability.          
                                                                                
10. Some may say that the Doughboys have figured out a radio-friendly           
formula but -- hey! -- it does work. Turn Me On is full of sparkly              
gems. Shine On.

ANCIENT WHALE SURFACES AT NASA LANGLEY                                          
                                                                                
     Thanks to the sharp eyes of two surveyors, the fossil remains              
of a 3.5-million-year-old whale have been discovered at NASA's                  
Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA.                                           
                                                                                
     The bones of the 30-foot juvenile baleen whale were                        
found July 15 by two surveyors working at a piping trench                       
under construction.  The findings include a skull, tympanic                     
bulla (part of the ear bones of a whale), vertebrae and rib                     
fragments.  More fossil remains are still to be unearthed.                      
                                                                                
     Langley is loaning the remains to the College of William                   
and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, for study, said John Mouring,                       
Langley's facility master planner and preservation officer.                     
                                                                                
     The discovery, considered rare but not unprecedented,                      
opens a window into the history of the Langley site about 3.5                   
million years ago, when the Atlantic shoreline was probably                     
30 to 40 miles west of its present location and covered the                     
Center, said Dr. Gerald (Jerre) Johnson of William and Mary's                   
geology department.                                                             
                                                                                
     "The research opportunity will provide insight into the                    
development of whales through geologic time," Johnson said.                     
                                                                                
     Preliminary work indicates the whale bones are the                         
remains of an almost mature creature that died and was                          
quickly buried on a broad, wave-swept sand shoal.                               
                                                                                
     The bones were about four feet below the surface of the                    
ground in a reddish-brown sandy clay of the upper weathered                     
part of the Yorktown Formation.  The lower beds in the trench                   
are sands comprised of broken marine mollusks, barnacles, and                   
other groups.  This soil grades upward into the weathered                       
part of the Yorktown Formation containing the whale remains.                    
                                                                                
     Shell material that once surrounded the whale has been                     
dissolved away by groundwater.  A gravel, sand and mud                          
sequence overlies the whale-bearing beds; these were deposited                  
in an ancestral Chesapeake Bay about 100,000 years ago.                         
                                                                                
     The highly broken condition of most of the shells in the                   
beds immediately below the whale tells of the strong wave and                   
current activities that prevailed in the area when the whale                    
came to rest on the sea floor.                                                  
                                                                                
        Johnson said the chronological age of the whale is                      
based upon the relative size of the tympanic bulla to the                       
vertebra, and the degree of fusion of the plates on the                         
central part of the vertebrae.  Even though the jaw has not                     
been found, the size of the ear bone indicates a baleen                         
rather than a toothed whale.                                                    
                                                                                
     The whale remains were discovered by two surveyors while                   
a utility contractor, T.A. Sheets, dug an eight-foot-deep                       
piping trench in the old rocket test area of the Center on                      
the south side of Lewis Loop near East Bush Road.                               
                                                                                
     The surveyors, Vanessa Butler and Kit Cain of Sverdrup                     
Technologies Inc., a Langley contractor, were working in the                    
area when they spotted two vertebrae and assorted rib pieces                    
in the excavated Earth pile.                                                    
                                                                                
     Knowing that Langley grounds are rich in prehistoric and                   
historic artifact resources and that they are managed here by                   
law, they took the bones to Mouring.                                            
                                                                                
     Mouring determined that animal remains not associated                      
with an archaeological context do not require preservation in                   
the federal system (except for Bureau of Land Management and                    
National Forests).  "This is paleontology - not cultural                        
resources," he said.  "If it is human-related (prehistoric or                   
historic) it must be managed here at Langley under the                          
National Historic Preservation Act."

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><H1>New Steven R. Boyett book: TREKS NOT TAKEN</CENTER></H1><BR><PRE>
                                                                                
I've just updated the Web pages I maintain on Steven R. Boyett (and             
the _The Architect of Sleep_ FAQ), to include a bunch of information            
about his newest book, _Treks Not Taken_.                                       
                                                                                
_Treks Not Taken_ is a collection of unproduced episode outlines for            
Star Trek: The Next Generation that were not (but *should* have                 
been) written by the likes of Tom Robbins, Anne Rice, Stephen King,             
Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac, James Joyce, Kurt Vonnegut, and even            
Dr. Seuss.                                                                      
                                                                                
As official keeper of Steve Boyett's bibliography on the World Wide             
Web, I've had the opportunity to add excerpts from the stories, and             
even some illustrations, to the Web pages I maintain.  This is very             
funny stuff ("Moby Trek" -- "The Vampire Leforge" -- "The Crusher in            
the Rye"...).  _Treks Not Taken_ should be out on the shelves later             
this month, and I'm certainly looking forward to it (even I only got            
the excerpts, I haven't seen the rest of the book yet).

Boyett will be doing a reading ala Jack Kerouac (with musical                   
accompaniment!) from _Treks Not Taken_ at the upcoming World Science            
Fiction Convention, and I'm *really hoping* to get some good audio              
or video of that.  If I can, I'll be making that available on the               
Web as well.

	This FAQ is meant to cut down on the numerous misspellings of                  
names, places, and all the wonderful stuff that get people all riled up.        
Mistakes and revisions and other stuff that should be on here should be

          The rim of the star-light                                             
     My love

          Strange love a star woman teaches.

          His journey ends never                                                
     His star trek

     While he wanders his starry sea                                            
          Remember, remember me.

          And a man a singing wind,                                             
     And from her branches carelessly                                           
          He'll take what he can find, can find                                 
          He'll take what he can find.

          He'll care no more for you,                                           
     And every day that your garden is waste,                                   
          Is covered all over with rue, with rue

from TNG "Brothers"                                                             
sung by Lore (only a few lines)                                                 
                                                                                
[version 1]                                                                     
     The sons of the Prophet as valiant and bold,                               
          And quite unaccustomed to fear;                                       
     And the bravest of all was a man, so I'm told                              
          Called Abdullah Bulbul Amir.                                          
                                                                                
     When they wanted a man to encourage the van,                               
          Or harass the foe from the rear,                                      
     Storm fort or redoubt, they were sure to call out                          
          For Abdullah Bulbul Amir.                                             
                                                                                
     There are heroes in plenty, and well known to fame,                        
          In the legions that fight for the Czar;                               
     But none of such fame as the man by the name                               
          Of Ivan Petrovsky Skovar.                                             
                                                                                
     He could imitate Irving, tell fortunes by cards,                           
          And play on the Spanish guitar;                                       
     In fact, quite the cream of the Muscovite guards,                          
          Was Ivan Petrovsky Skovar.                                            
                                                                                
     One day this bold Muscovite shouldered his gun,                            
          Put on his most cynical sneer,                                        
     And was walking downtown when he happened to run                           
          Into Abdullah Bulbul Amir.                                            
                                                                                
     "Young man," say Bulbul, "is existence so dull                             
          That you're anxious to end your career?                               
     Then, infidel, know you have trod on the toe                               
          Of Abdullah Bulbul Amir.                                              
                                                                                
     "So take your last look at the sea, sky and brook,                         
          Make your latest report on the war;                                   
     For I mean to imply that you are going to die,                             
          O Ivan Petrovsky Skovar."                                             
                                                                                
     So this fierce man he took his trusty chibouk,                             
          and murmuring "Allah Akbar!"                                          
     With murder intent he most savagely went                                   
          For Ivan Petrovsky Skovar.                                            
                                                                                
     The Sultan rose up, the disturbance to quell                               
          Likewise, give the victor a cheer.                                    
     He arrived just in time to bid hasty farewell                              
          To Abdullah Bulbul Amir.                                              
                                                                                
     A loud-sounding splash from the Danube was heard                           
          Resounding o'er meadows afar;                                         
     It came from the sack fitting close to the back                            
          Of Ivan Petrovsky Skovar.                                             
                                                                                
     There lieth a stone where the Danube doth roll,                            
          And on it in characters queer                                         
     Are "Stranger, when passing by, pray for the soul                          
          Of Abdullah Bulbul Amir."                                             
                                                                                
     A Muscovite maiden her vigil doth keep                                     
          By the light of the pale northern star,                               
     And the name she repeats every night in her sleep                          
          Is Ivan Petrovsky Skovar.

     The sons of the Prophet were brave men and bold,                           
          And quite unaccustomed to fear.                                       
     But the bravest of all was a man I am told                                 
          Named Abdullah Bulbul Ameer.                                          
                                                                                
     When they needed a man to encourage the van                                
          Or harass a foe from the rear.                                        
     Storm fort or redoubt they had only to shout                               
          For Abdullah Bulbul Ameer.                                            
                                                                                
     This son of the desert in battle aroused                                   
          Could split twenty men on his spear.                                  
     A terrible creature when sober or soused                                   
          Was Abdullah Bulbul Ameer.                                            
                                                                                
     The heroes were plenty and well known to fame                              
          That fought in the ranks of the Czar.                                 
     But the greatest of these was a man by the name                            
          Of Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.                                             
                                                                                
     He could imitate Irving, play poker or pool                                
          And strum on the Spanish guitar.

          Was Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.                                            
                                                                                
     The ladies all loved him, his rivals were few                              
          He could drink them all under the bar.                                
     Come gallant or tank there was no one to rank                              
          With Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.                                           
                                                                                
     One day this bold Russian had shouldered his gun                           
          And donned his most truculent sneer.                                  
     Downtown he did go where he trod on the toe                                
          Of Abdullah Bulbul Ameer.                                             
                                                                                
     "Young man", quoth Bulbul, "Has your life grown so dull                    
          That you're eager to end your career?                                 
     Vile infidel know you have trod on the toe                                 
          Of Abdullah Bulbul Ameer."                                            
                                                                                
     "So take your last look at the sunshine and brook                          
          And send your regrets to the Czar.                                    
     By this I imply you are going to die,                                      
          Mr. Ivan Skavinsky Skivar."                                           
                                                                                
     Said Ivan, "My friend, your remarks in the end                             
          Will avail you but little, I fear.                                    
     For you ne'er will survive to repeat them alive,                           
          Mr. Abdullah Bulbul Ameer."                                           
                                                                                
     Then this bold Mamalouk drew his trusty skibouk                            
          With a cry of "Allah Akbar".                                          
     And with murderous intent he ferociously went                              
          For Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.                                            
                                                                                
     They parried and thrust, they sidestepped and cussed                       
          Of blood they spilled a great lot.                                    
     The philologist blokes, who seldom crack jokes,                            
          Say that hash was first made on that spot.                            
                                                                                
     They fought all that night 'neath the pale yellow moon,                    
          The din it was heard from afar.                                       
     And multitudes came, so great was the fame,                                
          Of Abdul and Ivan Skivar.                                             
                                                                                
     As Abdul's long knife was extracting the life,                             
          In fact he had shouted, "Huzzah!"                                     
     He felt himself struck by that wily Calmuck,                               
          Count Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.                                          
                                                                                
     The Sultan drove by in his red-crested fly,                                
          Expecting the victor to cheer.                                        
     But he only drew nigh just to hear the last sigh                           
          Of Abdullah Bulbul Ameer.                                             
                                                                                
     Czar Petrovich too, in his spectacles blue                                 
          Drove up in his new crested car.                                      
     He arrived just in time to exchange a last line                            
          With Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.                                           
                                                                                
     A tomb rises up where the Blue Danube rolls,                               
          And 'graved there in characters clear,                                
     Is "Stranger when passing, oh pray for the soul                            
          Of Abdullah Bulbul Ameer."                                            
                                                                                
     A splash in the Black Sea one dark moonless night,                         
          Caused ripples to spread near and far.                                
     It was made by a sack fitting close to the back                            
          Of Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.                                             
                                                                                
     A Muscovite maiden her lone vigil keeps,                                   
          'Neath the light of the pale polar star.                              
     And the name that she murmurs so oft as she weeps                          
          Is Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.

"The Minstril Boy"                                                              
Sung by O'Brien with his captain                                                
from TNG "The Wounded"                                                          
                                                                                
     The minstrel boy to the war has gone,                                      
          In the ranks of death you will find him.                              
     His father's sword he hath girded on,                                      
          And his wild harp slung behind him.                                   
                                                                                
     Lands of songs said the warrior-bard,                                      
          Though all the world bestrays thee.                                   
     One sword at least thy rights shall guard,                                 
          One faithful harp shall praise thee.                                  
                                                                                
Second Verse (not sung in the episode):                                         
                                                                                
    The minstrel fell,                                                          
        But the foeman's chains couldn't bring that proud soul under.           
    The harp he bore ne'er spoke again                                          
        For he tore its cords asunder,                                          
    And said "no chains shall sully thee,                                       
        Thou soul of love and bravery                                           
    Thy songs were made for the pure and free                                   
        They shall never sound in slavery."

     Come cheer up my lads, 'tis to glory we steer,                             
          To add something new to this wonderful year;                          
     To honour we call you, not press you like slaves,                          
          For who are so free as the sons of the waves?                         
                                                                                
     Heart of Oak are our ships, Heart of Oak are our men,                      
          We always are ready.                                                  
     Steady, boys, steady,

     We ne'er meet our foes but we wish them to stay,                           
          They never see us but they wish us away;                              
     If they run, why, we follow, and run them ashore,                          
          For if they won't fight us, we cannot do more.                        
                                                                                
     Heart of Oak are out ships, Heart of Oak are our men,                      
          We always are ready.                                                  
     Steady, boys, steady,                                                      
          We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again.

"Banned from Argo" (there are a few variations in different versions)           
by Leslie Fish                                                                  
                                                                                
     When we pulled into Argo  in search of R & R                               
          Our crew set out investigating every joint and bar                    
     We had high expectations of their hospitality                              
          But found too late it wasn't geared for spacers such as we            
                                                                                
     CHORUS:                                                                    
     And we're...banned from Argo, every one                                    
          Banned from Argo, just for having a little fun                        
     We spent a jolly shore leave there for just 3 days or 4                    
          But Argo doesn't want us anymore                                      
                                                                                
     Our captain's tastes were simple but his methods were complex              
          He found him with five partners, each of a different world and sex    
     The shore police were on the way, we had no second chance                  
          We beamed him up in the nick of time in the remnants of his pants     
                                                                                
     CHORUS                                                                     
                                                                                
     Our engineer would yield to none in putting down the brew                  
          He outdrank 7 space marines and a demolition crew                     
     The navigator didn't win but he outdrank almost all                        
          And now they've got a shuttlecraft on the roof of city hall

     Our proper, cool first officer was drugged with something green            
          And hauled into an alley where he suffered things obscene             
     He sobered up in sickbay and he's none the worse for wear                  
          Except he somehow taught the bridge computer how to swear             
                                                                                
     CHORUS                                                                     
                                                                                
     The head nurse disappeared a while in the major [dope] bazaar              
          Buying an odd green liquid guaranteed to cause Pon-farr.              
     She came home with no uniform, and an oddly cheerful heart                 
          And a painful way of walking with her feet a yard apart

     Our lady of communications won a ship-wide bet                             
          By getting into the planet's main communications net                  
     Now, every time someone calls upon an Argo telescreen                      
          The flesh is there, but the clothes they wear are nowhere to be seen  
          (Yaah!)

     Our doctor loves humanity, his private life is quiet                       
          The shore police arrested him for inciting whores to riot.            
     They found him in the city jail, locked on and beamed him free             
          Intact except for hickies, and 6 kinds of V.D.

          (Gee, I wonder why?)                                                  
                                                                                
     Our helmsman loves exotic plants, and the plants all love him too          
          He took some down on leave with him, and we wondered what they'd do   
     Till the planetary governor called and swore upon his life                 
          That a gang of plants entwined his house, and then seduced his wife   
                                                                                
     CHORUS                                                                     
                                                                                
     A gang of pirates landed and nobody seemed to care                         
          They stomped into the nearest bar to announce that they were there    
          (We're here!)                                                         
     Half our crew was busy there and invited them to play                      
          The pirates only looked at us, and turned and ran away

     Our crew is Starfleet's finest, and our record is our pride                
          And when we play we tend to leave a trail a mile wide                 
     We're sorry 'bout the wreckage and the riots and the fuss                  
          At least we're sure that planet won't be quick forgetting us

"Twenty Years of Pointy Ears"                                                   
(sung to the tune of "When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again")                   
                                                                                
     From sixty-six to sixty-nine                                               
          There was a show                                                      
     About the Starship Enterprise                                              
          As we all know                                                        
     With funny ears, and Beetle boots,                                         
          And phaser guns that WE COULD SHOOT,                                  
     But Trek... got... canned...                                               
          'Cause the ratings were so low.                                       
                                                                                
     Letters from the fans didn't get                                           
          The show's fourth season on,                                          
     The Star Trek crew, now unemployed,                                        
          Made cash at sci-fi cons.                                             
     When the ranks of Trekkies grew and grew,                                  
          We noticed that some fans do to,                                      
     'Cause they nibble... just like tribbles...                                
          While they're watching Trek re-runs.                                  
                                                                                
     The fans all got together for                                              
          A new write-in campaign,                                              
     To get a TV movie made,                                                    
          But not one like "Spock's Brain"!                                     
     The network told them "GO TO HELL!",                                       
          But then found Star Trek toys sold well;                              
     But there's... no... mar... ket                                            
          In sci-fi films today.                                                
                                                                                
     (Just then when things seemed darkest,                                     
      There was a light... saber.)                                              
                                                                                
     The highest grossing movie in the                                          
          World is called Star Wars;                                            
     They read through the old Star Trek scripts, then                          
          Wrote one that's a bore.                                              
     Star Trek: The Motion Picture's trash, but                                 
          It should make a lotta cash:                                          
     The crew will wear pajamas                                                 
          And we'll make one of them bald.

     We'll sell them Star Trek handkerchiefs, and

Firebird Arts and Music (1-800-752-0494) sells several  well-done Star Trek

_Border Patrol_.  _Border  Patrol_, if  you haven't  heard all  the songs a     
hundred times before hand like  some of  us, is  an awesome  tape.  They're     
working on a new Star Trek  music tape  to be  released later  this year or     
next year called _To Boldly Go_.

Both Shatner and Nimoy have  attempted to  sing and  have a  few albums out     
(from the early 70s, I believe).   They are  *extremely* bad  and only good     
for comic relief.                                                               
                                                                                
Shatner sung at the 1992 MTV movie awards.                                      
                                                                                
Nichelle Nichols originally  sang the  tune Uhura  was singing  in ST5, but     
TPTB decided a few days before the  film was  released to  dub in Hiroshima     
singing the song.                                                               
                                                                                
Brent Spiner has an album out titled "Old Yellow Eyes is Back".                 
                                                                                
The band  T'Pau  (named after  the Vulcan  priestess from  TOS "Amok Time")     
claim they are not Star Trek  fans; they  just liked  the name.   DJs enjoy     
putting a few lines from "Amok Time" during the opening of  the song "Heart     
and Soul"  (McCoy:    "Do you  know who  that is?   That's  T'Pau!"  T'Pau:     
"Thees ees da Voolcan heart; thees ees da Voolcan soul...")                     
                                                                                
There is a parody of a 900 Foot Jesus song by 900 Foot Shatner (with a rap      
beat).                                                                          
                                                                                
A bunch of musical artists from Germany by the name of ORION whipped up a       
dance mix based on Star Trek sound effects and theme music.  It contains        
the intro music from TNG and sound effects from TOS (phasers, swooshing         
doors, communicators, etc.)                                                     
                                                                                
Leonard Nimoy was on the cover of the Bangles' first album.  He was also in     
one or two of their videos from that album.                                     
                                                                                
Susan Vega has a reference to Star Trek in one of her songs.                    
                                                                                
The German  band  Nena  mentions  "Captain Kirk"  in their  songs "99 Luft-     
balloons" and "99 Red Balloons".                                                
                                                                                
The Canadian group Brass Bikini has an album "Tastes Like Chicken" which        
contains a song with a soundbite of Kirk saying something like "Without         
freedom of choice.... the body dies".                                           
                                                                                
Swedish band S.P.O.C.K (Star Pilot On Channel K) plays futuristic

They have songs like "Never Trust A Klingon" from the album "Five               
Year Mission".

The Minneapolis band (now based in New York) "Information Society" likes        
putting Star Trek quotes in their songs.  Adam Nimoy (Leonard's son) is a       
fan and friend of the group.  Their first album "Information Society" has       
the following references in songs:

WALKING AWAY:

The remixes of "What's On Your Mind" and "Walking Away" also contain lots       
of TOS samples.

Their next album "Hack" (no doubt named after me (same hometown and all :-))    
had the following Star Trek references:

VRAMDIR is a dynamic 32-bit virtual RAM file system driver for Windows          
95. It is to replace RAM-disk and speed up hard-disk related                    
operations. VRAMDIR is over 30 times faster than hard-disks, 5 times            
faster than RAM-disks, and 2 times faster than disk-cache. VRAMDIR              
also keeps hard-disks less fragmented, saves hard-disk wears and                
tears, and saves battery power on notebook computers.                           
                                                                                
VRAMDIR does not pre-allocate any memory, and it has no practical               
limit on the amount of files it can hold. No matter how much RAM your           
system has, VRAMDIR puts it into more efficient use and speeds up the           
system. If the system has more than 32MB RAM, VRAMDIR prevents the RAM          
from being wasted; if the system has less than 16MB RAM, it is                  
important to use VRAMDIR to increase system speed.

Starring Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman and Rachel Weisz. Screenplay by           
J.F. Lawton and Michael Bortman. Directed by Andrew Davis. (AA)

                                  by                                            
                             MARK DILLON                                        
                                                                                
The major hurdle to enjoying Chain Reaction is believing in Keanu               
Reeves as Eddie Kasalivich, a University of Chicago student who                 
discovers a formula to produce clean energy from water, thereby                 
rendering petrol obsolete. Accept this fantasy and you will find Chain          
Reaction a decent summer thriller. But it could have been better.               
                                                                                
Keanu's limited acting ability is a drawback, but Chain Reaction                
succeeds on the level of intrigue. Obviously a scientific find such as          
this would have far-reaching political repercussions, and, only hours           
after the discovery, in a scene of bravura special effects, the U of C          
lab, along with the surrounding eight city blocks, is blown to                  
smithereens by an unknown terrorist group. But Eddie is still alive,            
thus the experiment could be duplicated. And so the chase is on, with           
the FBI, who suspect him in the explosion, racing against a mysterious          
underground organization to get to Eddie first.                                 
                                                                                
Along for the ride with Eddie is his university colleague Lily                  
Sinclair, played by English actor Rachel Weisz (Stealing Beauty).               
Darned if Keanu and Weisz don't just make the cutest physicist couple           
in screen history. Unfortunately, the film gets bogged down in too              
many stock action sequences, with a preponderance of coincidences,              
such as a hydrofoil conveniently appearing for our heroes to make a             
getaway.                                                                        
                                                                                
What raises the film out of the ordinary are the more veteran cast              
members. The venerable Fred Ward plays Agent Leon Ford, who leads the           
FBI manhunt. Morgan Freeman gives another great performance as the              
world-weary Shannon, the man who heads the university team that                 
discovers the energy source, yet who moonlights at the agency that              
tries to suppress it. Shannon is superseded in menace by his boss,              
played by the superb Brian Cox, who affects a haughty Virginia drawl            
that perfectly conveys the greed Americans feel toward oil.                     
                                                                                
Perhaps director Andrew Davis should have reunited with his star of             
The Fugitive, Harrison Ford, who would have been a more capable                 
adversary for all these fine bad men.

  Bordello: Online whore house!                                   $20           
                                                                                
  Basically, you are running your own whore house and fighting against          
  other players to attain the most profitable house by the end of the           
  month (or past the end of the month depending upon how you have the           
  door configured)! You can search for whores to work in your house             
  (you may only have 10 at any one time), hire thugs to fight other             
  players and to help protect your house, and many other features you           
  will soon become very familiar with!                                          
                                                                                
  "netgames" calls this - "A favorite on just about any BBS, Bordello           
  allows you to run your own house of ill repute. You'll need to hire           
  girls based on their attributes and see to it that they don't catch           
  any diseases or get roughed up by opposing players. You'll have to            
  slug it out with you enemies and plan your strategies for                     
  sabotaging their houses, breaking into their vault and other such             
  chicanery. Great fun and a quick and easy play!"

  your 'client' as much as possible. Don't be early. Don't be late.             
  And by all means, use protection or you're asking for trouble."

  Once again, let's hear from "netgames".

  Announce!: Send screens prior to door.                         FREE           
                                                                                
  My users contribute to registering door programs. I made this                 
  simple door as a way for all users to see who payed to have each              
  door registered. There is no fee for this door. Basically, all the            
  door does is send an ANSI screen prior to a door loading or after a           
  door is terminated. The ANSI screen is edited by the sysop.                   
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~           
  ANSI Voting Booth: Users vote on screens.                       $10           
                                                                                
  This is a fairly simple door program -- it allows you, the SysOp,             
  to setup up to 10 different ANSI screens for your users to vote on.           
  It's great for online competition between your users! Let your users          
  prepare ANSI screens, upload them to you, then let the other users            
  vote on their favorite ANSI screens! Shoot, offer a prize to the              
  winner!

  GoodUser: Good user door access only.                          FREE           
                                                                                
  This door works exactly opposite of BadUser (by T&J Software). By             
  editing the GOODUSER.LST file you can allow only your good users              
  to enter door games. Great for a tournament play between a select             
  group of users on your board. If a "Good User" is found, he is told           
  that his access has been granted to the selected door. If a person            
  is not listed in the GOODUSER.LST file, he is told that he does not           
  have access to the door.

  Money Market: Stock market game.                                $15           
                                                                                
  The user gets a chance to buy stock in up to 10 different companies.          
  Once registered, you the SysOp can change the name of the companies           
  to anything you want. You are given a certain number of game days             
  (as set by the sysop) to make as much money as possible. Your final           
  score is determined by how much PROFIT you make. Your initial                 
  starting money (which is set by the sysop) is subtracted from your            
  ending money to determine your score. Any profits made will be                
  carried over to the next day. This door resets every monday. Money            
  Market will reset the weekly scores every monday. Your profit will            
  be carried over to the next day (until the market resets). If you             
  have a negative profit, the following day you will be able to start           
  fresh.                                                                        
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~           
  OneRun: Set door entries.                                       $10           
                                                                                
  ONERUN was made to help compliment other T&J Software doors games             
  and future utility programs. It allows you, the SysOp, to set up              
  door games or other door programs for limited access during the               
  day. ONERUN creates a small player record file which contains the             
  players name, date, and number or plays during that day. This file            
  is checked during each play and the number of plays is adjusted. If           
  you say the player can only enter your door twice per day, OneRun             
  will only allow him to enter twice per day.

  T&J Lotto: Lotto number door.                                   $15           
                                                                                
  The T&J LOTTO Door allows your users to select numbers on a type of           
  lottery ticket. The number range is SysOp configurable along with             
  the number or tickets a person may enter per day. As the SysOp, you           
  can pick the prizes awarded for correctly getting 4, 5 or 6 digits            
  correct. The user gets a chance to pick 10 numbers per lottery                
  ticket from the number range you specify. Running TJLOTTO with the            
  command line LOTTO (maintenance program) must be run each night. The          
  LOTTO command line picks the winning numbers (it selects 6 numbers            
  from the range you specify) and then reads each of the users lottery          
  tickets and checks for winners. It will LOG the PRIZE WINNING                 
  tickets to a special SYSOP.LOG file for your records. It will also            
  keep a listing of the last 7 days of winning tickets for the users            
  to check. The door also maintains a statitics file which will keep            
  track of how many times the door was played, how many tickets                 
  (total) have been purchased, and the total winning tickets (tickets           
  matching 4, 5, or 6 digits). The user can check all winning lottery           
  tickets from the previous night and a summation of all PRIZE                  
  WINNING tickets for the last week.

  BadUser: Restricts door access.                                FREE           
                                                                                
  Have you ever had users that constantly drop carrier in door games?           
  Do you have some users who cry over the scores etc..? Now you can             
  lock these users from the doors of your choice! BadUser will check            
  a text file maintained by you -- and will keep these unwanted users           
  from playing those selected games/programs. The nice thing is they            
  won't know what is wrong (if you select the STANDARD configuration).          
  BadUser sends them no sign that it is being run except for a fake             
  ERROR message which says "COM Port Error -- Returning to BBS". In             
  CUSTOM mode, you may make and send a ANSI screen to the user. If              
  BadUser finds a "bad user" it will create a file called BAD.BAD.              
  The DOOR.BAT file will see it and skip the main door program and              
  head back to the BBS (see the sample batch file included).

  Convince!: Convince users to reg doors.                         $10           
                                                                                
  Convince! is a simple door program that you run before the real door          
  or after the real door. Convince! tracks the number of times a user           
  enters a door and after every 5 or 10 plays, presents him with a              
  message saying "User Name you have played this door xx times. Please          
  help contribute to register this door." You can configure Convince            
  to show this everytime (keeping tallies of all the plays), every 5            
  plays, or every 10 plays. Via the CONV!.SPE file you can include              
  "special users" that will not get the message. You may also bypass            
  users of specified security levels by adding the security level to            
  the SECURE.DAT file.

  jackpot, player starting money and number of attempts per day                 
  is all sysop configurable! At the conclusion of play, the door also           
  creates a top 25 score file, both color and mono. The door resets             
  automatically every Monday with the help of a maintenance program             
  which is built-in to the main Dollarmania! program. The jackpot               
  increases incrementally with every play! If the users spends all              
  of his/her money, he cannot play again until Monday when the door

  Lasso!: Classic online hangman door.                            $10           
                                                                                
  Lasso! is a "take off" of the popular hangman game. The door comes            
  with OVER 28,000 words in its word listing (your users should not             
  get bored very easily with this one)! The registered version allows           
  you to set the number of words per play a user may guess at, and              
  will also allow you to set the number of times a person may play per          
  day. Lasso! will keep track of how many times the door was opened,            
  how many "hangin's" there were, and the date of the last entry.

  Lemonade: Sell the most to win.                                 $10           
                                                                                
  LEMONADE is a fairly simple game. Your mother has given you $1.00             
  to get your lemonade stand started. The object of the game is to              
  sell as many glasses of lemonade as possible in a set number of               
  days. After the user hits the 'N' key he will be shown today's                
  weather forecast. He will then be prompted to enter how many                  
  glasses he wants to make followed by how much to charge per glass.            
  The weather and temperature have a direct bearing on how many                 
  glasses will be sold. If it rains, none will be sold.

  Prize Vault: Guess the combination.                             $10           
                                                                                
  Prize Vault is a door program which allows callers to try and guess           
  a four number combination of vault. If they successfully guess the            
  combination, they win the listed prize. I usually enter a prize               
  such as 500 fighters in Trade Wars, etc...  Other SYSOP's enter               
  such things as "a free large pizza..", not a bad idea! What about             
  those long distance callers! <grin> Prize Vault will not allow any            
  one else to guess at the combination once somebody has won. It is             
  up to the SYSOP to reset the combination and prize after a win.               
  Another item that was added are four "bar charts" to the right of             
  the screen. These bars will help users determine if they are                  
  getting NEAR the number or FAR away. Thus, you can use bigger                 
  numbers for the combination. There are four numbers to the                    
  combination and they can range from 1 to 999,999,999,999! You are             
  limited to 12 digits.

  Video Poker: Just like the casino's.                            $15           
                                                                                
  Video Poker is setup to duplicate the standard video poker type of            
  machine which are found in various locations. Basically, you select           
  your bet by pressing any of the number keys (from 1 to 9 or entering          
  your own bet if CUSTOM mode is seleceted) and the first set of five           
  cards appear. You then select the cards you wish to keep by                   
  selecting the card number (from 1 to 5). A yellow 'KEEP' will flash           
  below your choosen cards. You then select 'D' or simply hit the               
  ENTER key for your second draw of cards. A small status display in            
  the upper right portion of then main screen tells you your current            
  hand status by placing a blinking check mark inside the brackets.             
  This door resets every monday during the BBS maintenance. So, if              
  you're running behind bet it all on Sunday evenings! You never                
  know, you may catch up or surpass the leader! Each new bet starts             
  the turn with a new deck of cards. The status of the payoffs can              
  be viewed by pressing the 'P' key.  This will show you the payoff             
  versus what card combinations you have. On the right, it shows what           
  combinations had already come up. If you run out of money, you're             
  finished until monday when the door resets. So watch how much you             
  bet! This door also has a BONUS feature which your sysop may or               
  may not choose to use. Basically, a certain amount of money is                
  placed in the jackpot each time you play a hand of poker. The best            
  hand of the day will receive this jackpot money tomorrow! Be sure             
  to logon and claim the money, or you lose it!

  Ratio!: UL/DL ratio for door access.     v1.20     RATIO                      
                                                                                
  A simple door program to keep users out of doors if they don't keep           
  a good upload/download ratio. You set the ratio to maintain in the            
  SYSOP.CFG file. Let's say you put 20 in for the ratio. That means             
  you want your users to keep at least a 20 DL/1 UL ratio in order to           
  use the door. A special file called RATIO.USR is included. If you             
  have users who you want to bypass the ratio checking, just add their          
  name in this text file. If Ratio! finds a "bad user" it will create           
  a file called BAD.BAD. The DOOR.BAT file will see it and skip the             
  main door program and head back to the BBS (see the sample batch              
  file included).

  In this door you may play against 20 computer players in Strip Poker!         
  (10 females and 10 males). When you logon initially, you are asked            
  which player you want to play against (male or female). A second              
  screen comes up asking which of the 10 players you wish to play               
  against. Take a look at their stats! It shows how many hands each             
  one has won/lost, how many rounds they won/lost, and how much money           
  they've paid out or have taken in. After you select the player,               
  you're off to the main menu where the competition starts.

  OnLine! is basically a way for you, the SysOp, to setup your own              
  online type of magazine or your own online text search door. You can          
  make your own Hello and Goodbye screens, and you can have up to               
  1600 articles/ANSI screens for your users to read/search online               
  and have them broken down into 40 different sub-menus. OnLine also            
  supports downloading of articles/ansi screens right from within the           
  door itself. Users may download using X, Y, or ZModem transfer                
  protocols. You have the option to turn the downloading flag ON or             
  OFF when you add an article to the database using OLSETUP. Speaking           
  of downloading, OLSETUP also allows you to turn GLOBAL downloading            
  on or off also! OnLine will also prompt the user if he/she would              
  like the file Zipped prior to transferring the file! Think of OnLine          
  as a "shell" for you to build on. You can customize it to your                
  favorite colors, text files, ANSI screens etc. When viewing TEXT              
  files, you may SEARCH the text file for a KEYWORD, goto the next              
  page (like PAGE DOWN), and goto the previous page (like PAGE UP).             
  OnLine also has HELP available right from the main menu of the door           
  and the ability to generate STATISTICS on its usage.

  InBetween: Classic online card game.                                          
                                                                                
  The object of this game (as you already know <G>) is to bet on if             
  the third card played will be between the two cards shown. Be warned,         
  if the third draw is equal to one of the two displayed - you will             
  lose double your bet! A percentage of each LOST hand goes into the            
  jackpot. To win the jackpot money, you must get three of a kind! If           
  the first two cards are a pair, you will be prompted to hit enter to          
  take a chance at winning the jackpot! This costs nothing. The amount          
  paid for a winning hand varies depending on the spread of the original        
  two cards shown. This is configured by your sysop. The larger the             
  spread between the cards, the lower the payoff will be! There are two         
  ways to play (as set by your sysop). Play Type #1: The sysop sets             
  the number of hands per day that you are allowed. Let's say your              
  sysop sets this at 50 - in play mode #1, the door multiplies 50 by            
  7 (since this door resets every monday) thus giving 350 total hands.          
  You may play these hands at your convenience, 45 hands today, 115             
  hands tomorrow, etc... Once you play your 350 hands, you are done             
  for the week. Play Type #2: Let's use the same schematic as above             
  and you have 350 total hands. You will know you are in mode #2 by             
  looking at the menu screen. It will say, "350 hands per week/50 for           
  today". In play mode #2, the door divides your total hands left by            
  the number of days left before the door resets. Let's say you couldn't        
  play the door on monday or tuesday, when you logon on wednesday, the          
  door divides 350 by 5 (5 days left before it resets) and allows you           
  to play 70 hands on wednesday.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                                                             
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News                      
Number 281  July 29, 1996  by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein                   
                                                                                
SOLAR NEUTRINO FLUX IS NOT CORRELATED WITH                                      
SUNSPOT ACTIVITY.  The Kamiokande detector, situated a                          
kilometer underground west of Tokyo, has been watching the sun                  
since January 1987.  It sees not the photons that come from the                 
bright surface but rather the neutrinos that issue from the sun's               
core.  In the past decade Kamiokande has ascertained several facts:             
neutrinos do come from the direction of the sun (in case there were             
any doubt); the neutrinos are largely those from the decay of boron-8 (other det
nuclear reactions in the sun); and the neutrinos show no day/night              
preference. Having monitored our local star over almost a complete              
11-year solar cycle, the researchers  (Yoshiro Suzuki,                          
suzuki@icrkm4.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp) now take stock of their neutrino              
inventory and report that the neutrino flux shows no correlation                
with sunspot activity.  (Y. Fukuda et al., upcoming article in                  
Physical Review Letters.)                                                       
                                                                                
THE PHYSICS OLYMPIAD IN OSLO, like the sports Olympiad                          
in Atlanta, asks teenagers to race, hurdle, and vault past well-trained competit
obstacles were all on paper.  In one event, for example, the                    
participants were required to determine the size of tides on Earth in           
the plane of the Moon's orbit, while not neglecting  to allow for the           
Earth's rotation.  Teams from 55 countries came to the Olympiad,                
which ended July 7.  China collected the greatest number of points,             
with Romania as runnerup.  The U.S. was third, followed by                      
Russia, Vietnam, Germany, and Iran. The five American students                  
all won medals; gold-medalist Christopher Hirata of Deerfield,                  
Illinois, aged 13, got an award for being the youngest medalist.                
(For more information contact Dwight E. Neuenschwander, AIP,                    
301-209-3010.)                                                                  
                                                                                
TUNNEL JUNCTION MAGNETORESISTANCE may lead to                                   
higher-density magnetic storage devices.  Physicists have known for             
some time that sandwiches of alternating magnetic and nonmagnetic               
microlayers can undergo a change in electrical resistance in the                
presence of an external magnetic field (arising, say, from a tiny               
domain on a segment of magnetic tape).  This magnetoresistance                  
(MR) effect  can be used to decode binary data and has been                     
employed in reading heads in computer hard drives.  Giant                       
magnetoresistance (GMR), a stronger version of MR, affords even                 
greater data-decoding sensitivity.  Prototype hard-drives with read             
heads using GMR have achieved areal data densities of 3                         
Gbits/sq.in. Tunnel junction magnetoresistance (JMR) is yet another             
approach to transforming a tiny magnetic field into a change in                 
resistance.  Unlike the all-metal GMR sensor, a room-temperature                
JMR sensor consists of two metal (ferromagnetic) layers  separated              
by an insulating layer.  A JMR trilayer junction tested recently at             
MIT is only 20 nm thick  and the signal (the fractional change in               
resistance) was 23%, compared to a signal of less than 7%  for a                
40-nm-thick, 4-layer GMR prototype.  MIT physicist Jagadeesh                    
Moodera (moodera@slipknot.mit.edu; 617-253-5423) suggests that                  
the more compact size, relatively larger signal, and the low sub-nanoamp operati
engineering of devices and lower production costs.  An areal density            
of more than 10 Gbits/sq.in. is possible, he says.  (J.S. Moodera et            
al., Applied Physics Letters, 29 July.)

This week: Urban cowboys and suburban bovines -- would-bes pray like            
Aretha Franklin. (And kids under 19 get in for free.)                           
                                                                                
* CRUCIAL CONFLICT/The Final Tic (Pallas/Universal/MCA): Bonehead               
thugs who twist their tongues like whip-crackin' cowboys, reaping               
their rewards on the ranch by smoking "Hay!" (heh-heh). Perhaps these           
rodeo clowns would be reason enough to revive Hee-Haw, but their head-          
bobbing gitty-up is gradually revealed to be little more than Miami             
bass throb slowed down to 16 rpm.                                               
                                                                                
* SADAT X/Wild Cowboys (Loud/RCA/ BMG): Considerably more credible Ol'          
West shit from the Brand Nubian nexus. Certainly the posse approach             
can lend itself to more cerebral saloon-like atmospherics -- not to             
mention sampling Ennio Morricone's theme from The Good, The Bad And             
The Ugly. Better still, a heartily wholesome supremacist antidote to            
this season's surfeit of post-gangsta wallpaper.                                
                                                                                
* DOG EAT DOG/Play Games (Roadrunner/Atti/MCA): Nauseating numbskull            
rap-rock that harnesses slick metal chops for the sake of being an              
apolitical answer to Rage Against The Machine. At least the Wu-Tang             
Clan's RZA and Ronnie James Dio are recruited for facile cameo                  
appearances -- and the only ones humiliated in the process are those            
listeners who assume the remainder of the album is just as amusing.             
                                                                                
* MONA LISA/"11-20-79" (Island/PolyGram): Much wearier than either her          
name or age implies -- she sacrifices verve for vigor from start to             
finish. Rare is the teenage diva whose debut album can leave you                
thirsty for more.                                                               
                                                                                
* FIONA APPLE/Tidal (Work/Sony): Pungently precocious (she's 18) and            
overwrought overall, but a sure bet for stardom this century -- even            
if her husky earthtones too often recall a cursed past prodigy called           
Tanita Tikaram. Incidentally, Apple is the first artist of the apres-           
Alanis harvest whose stare is even more alluringly weird than Ms.               
Morissette's.                                                                   
                                                                                
* DONNA LEWIS/Now In A Minute (Atlantic/Warner): Sophie B. hacking.             
                                                                                
* HORACE BROWN/Horace Brown (Motown/PolyGram): Sinewy singer saddled            
with the task of making Motown Marvin-y again. Yet his credited                 
clothing designers leave a more intriguing impression than the pat              
Puffy Combs-led production squad. Furthermore, in the shadow of                 
D'Angelo's organic success, this sort of swarthy posturing can't help           
but seem awfully passe.                                                         
                                                                                
* MISTA/Mista (EastWest/Warner): Middling manipulators Organized Noize          
claim the vacancy created by Hi-Five's demise with the soaringly lip-           
smackin' single "Blackberry Molasses." Technically, these teen                  
discoveries are pretty terrible singers -- the disc sounds like a               
choir practice whose ranks have just gotten over their reluctance to            
emote. Welcome to the real world... (oh wait, that was Mr. Mister).

This is a modified Hellman's recipe that everyone asks me to make for           
family cook-outs.                                                               
                                                                                
Ingredients:                                                                    
1C mayonnaise                                                                   
2T red wine vinegar                                                             
1/2T salt

1/4 t pepper                                                                    
1C sliced celery                                                                
1/2C chopped onion                                                              
2 chopped hard boiled eggs                                                      
4T parsley                                                                      
1t paprika                                                                      
2T Dijon mustard                                                                
5 or 6 medium red skin potatoes                                                 
                                                                                
Instructions: Boil potatoes until cooked through. In the meantime, stir         
together all other ingredients. Allow the potatoes to cool just enough to       
handle them. Cut them into ~1 inch chunks and stir into bowl containing         
the other ingredients. Cover and refrigerate. Makes 5 or 6 cups.

1. About WizCat/PRO                                                             
                                                                                
What is it ?                                                                    
WizCat/PRO is todays most advanced cataloging system.                           
It helps you keep track of your growing collection of files on                  
floppydisks, opticals, harddisks and especially CDROMs.                         
Its userfriendly displays and splendid graphics make WizCat/PRO a joy           
to work with ; its high speed, high capacity and numerous useful                
features make it an indispensable tool for the power user.                      
                                                                                
What does it do ?                                                               
With WizCat/PRO you can create a database (or catalog) of all the               
files that hide on your disks. Then, if you need a specific file, you           
can use WizCat to search the database and quickly find that file among          
all those thousands of other files you have.                                    
                                                                                
WizCat/PRO also tries to document the files ; when cataloging a disk,           
it automatically reads descript.ion and files.bbs files which contain           
descriptions of those files.                                                    
In addition, you can import filedescriptions from other sources, for            
instance indexlistings on CDROMs or BBS AllFiles listings.                      
With the utility-program WizCat/DIZ you can even extract all                    
FILE_ID.DIZ filedescriptions from ZIP and ARJ archives.                         
WizCat/PRO can handle filedescriptions of up to 500 characters.                 
                                                                                
WizCat/PRO even helps you when you don't know what you're looking               
for...                                                                          
Suppose you buy a new CD ; how on earth can you see what's on it ?              
The Windows' FileManager or Explorer leaves you out in the cold, as             
it would take you ages to browse through thousands of folders and               
files with cryptic names.                                                       
Again WizCat/PRO comes to the resque : it can instanly show you all             
files by 'function class', e.g. programs, graphics, archives, etc.              
Or you can browse through the folder list, or show all files created            
in 1995, etc.                                                                   
                                                                                
So, no matter how vast the amount of data on your disks : WizCat/PRO            
provides the guided tour. In four languages...                                  
                                                                                
After having found a file, you probably want to do something with it.           
With the 'Work with File' function you can start any Windows program            
to work with that file. Or you can 'drag' the file to another                   
application.                                                                    
With the utility-program WizCat/unZIP you can even unpack ZIP and ARJ           
archive files !                                                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
2. Major enhancements in the 4.2 release :                                      
                                                                                
* WizCat/PRO has been updated to support the peculiarities                      
  of Windows 95. However, the program runs in 16-bit mode in                    
  order to remain compatible with Windows 3.1/3.11.                             
  When running with Windows 95 WizCat/PRO uses some of the                      
  32-bit API functions to support long filenames.                               
                                                                                
* A new Work with File window replaces the Restore and                          
  Associate windows.                                                            
  On this window you can define your favorite programs to WizCat.               
  Then, with a simple double-click on its icon you can run the                  
  program, and then it immediately opens the file you're working                
  with.                                                                         
                                                                                
* New function on the 'Files' menu : Duplicate Files. Use this                  
  function to display all files that occur more than once in the                
  catalog.                                                                      
                                                                                
* A double-click on a file listed on the File List window will                  
  instantly run the program that has a Windows-defined association              
  with that file. If there is no association defined, or if the                 
  associated program is unable to open the file, the 'Work with File'           
  window will be shown instead.                                                 
                                                                                
* When updating a disk in the catalog, the Recatalog window will                
  accurately show (and optionally print) all files that have been               
  added, deleted, updated or regressed.                                         
  This information can be used to see the changes that occurred when            
  installing new software.                                                      
                                                                                
* On the Search Files window you can now specify multiple arguments             
  using and/or/not operators on the Filename, Folder and Comment fields.        
                                                                                
* The new Index function displays a list of all words that occur in             
  comment-entries.

PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE                                                            
====================                                                            
This release of WebEdit PRO fixes the bugs found in                             
beta 3 and adds a number of important new tools,                                
including:

* WYSIWYG Form Builder                                                          
* FTP Upload Module

* Robust third-party add-on API                                                 
                                                                                
The purpose of this pre-release is to ensure that                               
all of the new tools are stable, complete, and usable                           
before we ship the final release.                                               
                                                                                
We expect to release the final version of WebEdit                               
PRO 2.0 in July.                                                                
                                                                                
32-BIT VERSION

This pre-release version of WebEdit PRO 2.0 is only                             
in a 32-bit version for Windows 95 and Windows NT.                              
                                                                                
ADD-ON MODULES

If you are interested in creating add-on modules                                
for WebEdit PRO, please read the following:                                     
                                                                                
WebEdit PRO add-on modules are ordinary Windows                                 
dynamic link libraries, with a few special                                      
requirements.  All of the new tools listed above                                
were created as WebEdit add-on modules, which                                   
should give you an idea of the kinds of tools                                   
you can create for WebEdit.                                                     
                                                                                
A developers' kit for third-party add-on creation                               
will be available from our home page within a week                              
or so.  If you have questions about writing WebEdit

This is my husband's all time favorite but I only make it on holidays           
because it is so rich.  You can play with the fat content some but it           
does change the texture.                                                        
                                                                                
Cream Corn Casserole                                                            
                                                                                
1 can (15 oz.) cream style corn                                                 
1/4 c. melted butter                                                            
2 eggs, beaten                                                                  
1/2 c. yellow corn meal                                                         
1 tsp salt                                                                      
1 c. sour cream                                                                 
1 c. diced Cheddar cheese                                                       
1/3-1/2 c. chopped green pepper                                                 
                                                                                
Combine all ingredients and pour into 9" sq. casserole dish, sprayed with       
coating.  Bake at 350F for 1 hour or until brown on top.  Serves 8.

eye WEEKLY                                              August 1, 1996

A mid-summer roundup of mostly inexplicable reissues                            
                                                                                
STYX/Greatest Hits Part 2/ A&M/PolyGram . Commemorating Tommy Shaw's            
liberation from the constraints of Damn Yankees, this set succeeds in           
explaining how Styx came to confine themselves to bleating concept              
albums in the early '80s. Those records, Paradise Theatre and Kilroy            
Was Here, now seem like last-ditch efforts to harness the brilliance            
that tended to get obscured by commercially quenching "Babe" or                 
"Lady"-like lubriciousness.                                                     
                                                                                
This is the quintessential compendium of second-string singles                  
("Mademoiselle," "Sing For The Day," the deranged "Borrowed Time,"              
which starts with the spine-tingling cackle "Don't look now -- here             
come the '80s!") and even niftier buried treasures. Dennis DeYoung's            
effervescent elf vocals are at their most baroque on "First Time,"              
while "Superstars" is Styx at their most incendiary. A limp 1991 also-          
ran, "Love At First Sight" is also included -- a reminder of how                
wayward the band became sans Shaw.                                              
                                                                                
Now, the circle is reconfigured for the can't-miss finger-snapper "It           
Takes Love" -- DeYoung delivering his most spirited vocal since his             
sole solo hit "Desert Moon." Meanwhile, Shaw takes his "Girls With              
Guns" gregariousness into the eighth dimension with "Little Suzie," a           
heady romp across the era since this lineup was last intact. It's               
certain to satisfy the cravings of all those who never thought the              
word "infomercial" would ever weave its way into a Styx song.                   
                                                                                
-- MARC WEISBLOTT                                                               
                                                                                
TAKE THAT/Greatest Hits/BMG . The best-looking, most successful, most           
virtuous British pop band of the decade broke up while on the verge of          
making it with America, forcing disappointed Yanks to console                   
themselves by giving in to those disgusting Oasis boys (who, you know,          
are only after one thing). Save a tear for the morning after -- Take            
That's greatest hits open with a silky "How Deep Is Your Love" and the          
lugubrious "Never Forget," but track three is the masterpiece: "Back            
For Good," which makes Barry Manilow, Cutting Crew and Wham! seem all           
that much more obsolete. Like birds on a wire, though I don't mean to           
imply that Take That were in any way girly. The rest of the ballads             
are pretty skanky, but "It Only Takes A Minute" fulfils the hopes and           
dreams of us Rick Astley fans who spurned him when he grew his hair             
long. Most of the best songs were written by the group's second-                
ugliest member, Gary Barlow -- will wonders never cease. And if "Why            
Can't I Wake Up With You" doesn't make you quiver, you have no glands.          
                                                                                
-- JASON ANDERSON                                                               
                                                                                
THE CARDIGANS/ Emmerdale /Trampolene/PolyGram . The first album by              
Sweden's hippest pure pop combo. Featuring a few tracks ("Sick &                
Tired" and the cover of "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath" among them) that               
ended up on the successful international debut Life, Emmerdale is               
engaging because it's not as psychotically cheerful as Life: more               
early Everything But The Girl than Eurovision Song Contest gone awry.           
Scandinavian winsomeness abounds, putting singer Nina Persson more in           
league with my beloved ice maiden Stina Nordenstam. Persson gets                
marvellous assistance from Lars-Olof Johansson, Peter Svensson... ah,           
that's quite enough Swedes. -- J.A.                                             
                                                                                
N.W.A./Greatest Hits/Priority/ Virgin/EMI  . Sort of like seeing                
episodes of Monty Python's Flying Circus 25 years after the fact --             
the style has been pilfered by so many others that it's near                    
impossible to see what was so innovative in the first place. In                 
retrospect, neither the N.W.A. crew's debut's socio-political                   
invective ("F*** Tha Police") nor the puerile romps that followed               
("Just Don't Bite It") exude much that's either euphoric or ecstatic.           
Blame it on Ice Cube -- before he flew the coop, the late Easy-E and            
recently ashamed Dr. Dre were content to defer to him more often than           
not. Without his finesse, they went from being rappers to industry              
moguls-in-waiting. Consequently, it's hard to find anything more                
engaging or ambitious than Cube's superb stickhandling of "Express              
Yourself." Otherwise, just a reminder that, unless the complexion of            
civilization changes profoundly in the next few days, this century              
won't experience such sheer egregiousness ever again. -- M.W.                   
                                                                                
ELVIS PRESLEY/56/RCA/BMG . Whoah. Whoah-a-hoah. A fine cure for box-            
set-itis (worse than stress-induced eczema): a single disc devoted to           
Elvis' activities in his first year at RCA. "Blue Suede Shoes," "Hound          
Dog," "Don't Be Cruel" and much more -- swinging, joshing, the whole            
schtick just about to become second nature, the King getting off on             
his own charms. It's maybe the last batch of recordings on which Elvis          
seems a part of a band -- with Scotty Moore, Bill Black and D.J.                
Fontana -- rather than a star with some guys from the union behind              
him. The only trouble is that after "Heartbreak Hotel," it's all the            
slightest bit anticlimactic. -- J.A.                                            
                                                                                
LIGHTNING SEEDS/Pure/ Virgin/EM  . A totally inexplicable comp that             
cashes in on Ian Broudie's group's success in England with                      
Jollification, but the closest they (or he) hit here was with 1990's            
"Pure," big in the day that alt-rock radio still had the good taste to          
play the Pet Shop Boys. The rest is by turns charming and terrible.             
Now this is girly. -- J.A.                                                      
                                                                                
TEARS FOR FEARS/                                                                
                                                                                
Saturnine Marital & Lunatic/ Mercury/PolyGram . A compilation for the           
record label that Roland Orzabal left behind -- and you just know what          
a priceless property he's become since -- this disc is unwarranted to           
the point of intrigue. A constant collision of trends with B-sides and          
experiments inspired by fodder like Sylvia Plath, quantum physics and,          
oh yeah, the theme from Threesome, it's pretty turgid 'til Roland               
warbles his way through a Todd Rundgren-calibre approximation of David          
Bowie's "Ashes To Ashes." But Mr. Big Chair's indifference toward               
entertaining is exposed in his comments on the closing number "The Way          
You Are" -- easily, TFF's most enthralling non-hit: "I think this was           
the point at which we had to change direction," he smirks at his                
attainment of poncey perfection that doubtlessly made Kajagoogoo                
envious. Then again, maybe all of the group's best ideas came from the          
other guy. -- M.W.

                             ARF                                                
                                                                                
    Arf searches web databases such as Alta Vista, Lycos,                       
    and Deja News.                                                              
                                                                                
    Arf copies every page it finds onto your disk drive.                        
                                                                                
    You type in a search term and tell Arf which database to contact.           
    Arf contacts that database and tells it to do a search. The                 
    database sends back a list of web pages (or Usenet posts in                 
    the case of Deja News). Arf goes out on the Internet, gets                  
    those web pages, and copies them to your hard disk.                         
                                                                                
What are the benefits of Arf?                                                   
                                                                                
    Get every page. Arf doesn't forget a single one.                            
    Save time. Arf searches faster than any human.                              
    Save money. Connect time is reduced to a minimum.                           
                                                                                
    Start up several copies of Arf to search more than one                      
    database at a time - while you do other work. When Arf                      
    is done, disconnect from the Internet and view your                         
    results offline - with no network lag.                                      
                                                                                
    Arf is great for writers, researchers, and surfers.

(FAQ) Can I Buy a Star, or Have One Named?                                      
==========================================                                      
                                                                                
Q: Can I buy a star, or have one named?                                         
A: No.                                                                          
                                                                                
Q: But I heard there were organizations that would do this for you.             
   Isn't that true?                                                             
A: No. There are organizations that will take your money and send you a         
   certificate, but those documents have no validity and are not                
   recognized by anyone else.                                                   
                                                                                
Q: Come on! Why can't we do this, just for fun?                                 
A: If it is "just for fun", you might as well save money and print out          
   your own certificate. It will be just as valid.                              
                                                                                
Q: OK, I understand the practice is probably a "scam", but I have a             
   special situation. A dying child has requested her own star, and how         
   can we possibly refuse her?                                                  
A: That is a difficult case. In the end, we can either tell the truth           
   ("I'm sorry, Dear, but it is just not possible") or lie and obtain a         
   certificate. In the later case, there is still no reason to give             
   money to a "star naming" agency. Finally, I would ask "How do                
   children get such ideas, unless some adult suggests it to them?"             
                                                                                
========================================================================        
                                                                                
[The following was provided by Jim Craig <jccraig@OREGON.UOREGON.EDU>]          
                                                                                
Q: Can I buy a star? What about the companies that claim that I can pay         
to have a star named after me or someone else?                                  
                                                                                
A: Save your money. The various businesses that claim that you can have         
a star named after you or a friend are only going to separate you from          
your money. They might put your name in a database and they may send you        
a certificate that lists the coordinates of "your" star but it's no more        
official than having any individual name a star.                                
                                                                                
The names of astronomical objects are determined by the International           
Astronomical Union (I.A.U.). Usually, the only time an object is named          
after a living person is when that person (or persons) discover the             
object (e.g. Comet Levy was discovered by David Levy, Barnard's Star was        
discovered by E.E. Barnard, etc.).                                              
                                                                                
Planetary names come from Roman mythology. This also holds true in the          
case of planetary names although many of the moons of Uranus were named         
after characters from Shakespeare's "A Midsummer's Night's Dream."              
                                                                                
Star names come to us via historical convention. Most of the stars that         
have individual names were named thousands of years ago and were first          
catalogued by Ptolomey in ancient Egypt. The names come from folklore,          
mythology and location (such as Polaris). All stars are also given a            
numerical designation based on the constellation in which they're found         
and their relative brightness. The brightest are given a Greek letter           
designation followed by the name of the constellation such as Alpha             
Centauri, Sigma Draconis, etc. After the last letter of the Greek               
alphabet (omega) is used, the remaining stars are given numerical               
designations followed by the constellation name such as 51 Pegasi, 38           
Ursa Majoris, etc.                                                              
                                                                                
Craters and planetary feature names can have various origins. For               
example, the IAU has asked that the names of famous women (particularly         
in the sciences) be submitted for naming features on the surface of             
Venus that have recently been revealed by the Magellan probe.                   
                                                                                
The discoverers of numbered minor planets have the traditional privilege        
of proposing a name for their discoveries.  Asteroids named after               
musicians Frank Zappa, Jerry Garcia and John Lennon were all named by           
sympathetic discoverers.                                                        
                                                                                
Objects that were named prior to the formation of the IAU will retain           
their names.                                                                    
                                                                                
For more information on this function of the IAU, see the Royal                 
Greenwich Observatory leaflet, "The Naming of Stars" at

If you feel you need to buy something astronomical for yourself or a            
friend, get a subscription to one of the astronomy magazines like               
"Astronomy" or "Sky and Telescope," a book, a planisphere or tickets to         
a planetarium show. In this manner, you can connect with the universe of        
astronomy and get some value for your money.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><H1>FrescoVFX release</CENTER></H1><BR><PRE>
                                                                                
Dear Developers,                                                                
                                                                                
We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of the FrescoVFX          
release.  For those who are unfamiliar with Fresco, it is an                    
object-oriented user interface system that supports the development             
highly interactive distributed graphics applications.  Please refer             
to our web page at www.faslab.com for more information.                         
                                                                                
In addition of various bug fixes and performance enhancements, the              
FrescoVFX release features an authoring/visualization  tool called              
VFX, dynamically loadable applets including a shared whiteboard                 
prototype called Cwire, and better styled text support.                         
                                                                                
The current release includes binaries for SPARCstations running                 
Solaris 2.4 or later, and Wintel platforms running Windows 95                   
and Windows NT 3.51 only.  As an effort to isolate client code from the         
implementation and to maintain our control over the evolution of                
Fresco, only partial source of the core is included.  However, full             
source of the applet examples is included as a reference.                       
                                                                                
We apologize for not being able to support more platforms for this              
release.  Due to our limited resource, we would rather do a few things          
well than everything poorly, but we do hope to remedy this situation in         
the future.                                                                     
                                                                                
Please send us feedback at fresco@x.org, your continued support is              
very important to us.                                                           
                                                                                
Specifically, we would like you to comment on the following issues:             
                                                                                
1) What do you think are the strengths and weaknesses of Fresco?                
2) What features would you like to see added to Fresco?  Would you              
like to see Fresco applications like VFX as ActiveX controls?                   
3) Would you be interested if Fresco were a supported product?

****VFX description****                                                         
                                                                                
VFX (Visual Fresco eXplorer) is a highly customizable, extensible, and          
integrated environment for the authoring and visualization of Fresco            
objects.  By installing/removing various tools and commands, VFX                
becomes a generic launching pad for any Fresco applet.  VFX's own               
definition becomes completely dependent on the objects being                    
visualized.  The primary concept adopted by VFX content is the merging          
of documents, graphics, widgets, layouts and applications.  Leveraging          
powerful models for blending [1] and elasticity [2] support from                
Fresco, VFX features a visualization metaphor called "Selective                 
Augmentation" where the chosen object is moved progressively toward             
the user.  The experience is similar to one trying to pick up an                
object to examine it in detail.

and Technology, Nov 2-4, 1994, pp. 167-174.

and Technology, Nov 3-5, 1993, pp. 35-43.                                       
                                                                                
****CWire description****                                                       
                                                                                
Cwire is a simple, collaborative applet which illustrates how Fresco's          
CORBA-based object system facilitates the development of collaborative,         
cross-platform applications.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| This week the votes from  365 people have been used to compile this chart. |  
| Send your votes to movies@worldcharts.nl and you'll get the next chart     |  
| sent to you personally. Ask for the document that tells how to vote. Just  |  
| send a message with subject line 'send doc' and you'll know all about it.  |  
| The format for every line with a vote is:  points title [ ID ]             |  
| YOU MUST INCLUDE THE ID NUMBER, and between brackets! It is NOT optional.  |  
| Use [] or [0000] as the ID number for albums not yet listed in the chart.  |  
| You can allocate a maximum of 20 points, BUT NOT MORE THAN 5 FOR ONE MOVIE.|  
| An example can be found at the bottom of this list. LOOK AT IT FIRST!      |

==============================================================================  
                                                                                
 With five new movies earning a bullet this week it seems like we have an       
 interesting few weeks to expect. Supercop continues its respectable climb,     
 now up to #34, and A Time to Kill, although a bit late, has now als finally    
 taken off heading for the upper regions of the chart, now at #61.              
                                                                                
 The newest box-office hits in the USA are Jack, Escape from L.A. and Matilda,  
 which have also been awarded with a bullet, although their entries on the      
 list are actually still a bit modest compared to the shocks caused by movies   
 like Twister and Independence Day some weeks ago. No new Top 10 hits among     
 these titles for our global list, I dare to say, but still worth checking out  
 according to our voters.                                                       
                                                                                
 I'd like to take this opportunity to inform the voters and readers of our      
 lists about the new charts software and website that are being developed.      
 We're building a new engine than can do much more in much less time. For each  
 title in the list we're going to show you from which countries the votes       
 are coming. You can see the history of each title in the chart, several        
 interesting URLs for each title, and possibly names and email addresses of     
 voters for each of the entries, so fans can get in contact with eachother if   
 they want. Voting through email will get easier and more powerful too.         
 Voters will be able to spread votes over different messages and re-route our   
 charts to other email addresses.                                               
                                                                                
 Apart from that, the algorithms for the charts will get even more              
 professional. The new engine can deal properly with votes received from        
 publishers, who are voting for their own titles, with excessive lobbies and    
 people stuffing the ballot through different email addresses. Fake email       
 addresses will be taken care of automatically, and floods of votes that are    
 a result from newsgroup or mailing list calls will be detected. Full details   
 of all algorithms and mechanisms will be published as soon as the engine is    
 ready.                                                                         
                                                                                
 You will understand that all this programming and designing takes a lot of     
 time, so there's a little less promotion and updating to the current website   
 these weeks. You will start seeing the changes very soon, and from there we    
 will have more time, more features and even more eagerness to keep the lists   
 running and hopefully introduce even more entertainment charts before the      
 end of the year. With 5,500 weekly voters the Internet Charts are the leading  
 entertainment polls on the Internet. There's no way back...                    
                                                                                
 Stay with us, keep voting, and see you all next week!                          
                                                                                
 Jurgen.                                                                        
                                                                                
 The following Top 100 contains the best movies and videos in the world.        
 Vote for a movie in this chart if you think other people should see it too.

CREW MEMBERS NAMED TO LIFE SCIENCE MISSION                                      
                                                                                
     Two mission specialists have been named to a 16-day Space Shuttle          
mission dedicated to gather information on how humans and animals               
adapt to space and the ability of humans to survive in a microgravity           
environment for an extended period of time.                                     
                                                                                
     Astronauts Richard M. Linnehan, DVM, and Dafydd (Dave) Rhys                
Williams, MD, (Canadian Space Agency) are the first crew members                
named to support the STS-90 Neurolab mission, scheduled for launch              
in March 1998.  The remaining crew members will be named at a later             
date.                                                                           
                                                                                
     Linnehan flew previously on Columbia's record setting 17-day Life          
and Microgravity Science mission in June-July 1996.   Williams will be          
making his first flight into space.                                             
                                                                                
      Investigations during the Neurolab mission will focus on the effects      
of microgravity on the nervous system.  Specifically, experiments will          
study the adaptation of the vestibular system and space adaptation syndrome,    
the adaptation of the central nervous system and the pathways which             
control the ability to sense location in the absence of gravity, and            
the effect of microgravity on a developing nervous system.

     In the words of that eminently quotable maestro of malapropisms,           
Yogi Berra, "It's deja vu all over again."                                      
                                                                                
     After a brief hiccup that saw the releases of COURAGE UNDER FIRE,          
MULTIPLICITY, and A TIME TO KILL, we're right back into the thick of the        
action again.  And, as has been the style all season, it's adrenaline           
without brains.  Looking back to the summer's beginning with TWISTER,           
you can probably name about a dozen movies that belong in this group --         
some of which were reasonably entertaining, some of which weren't.              
CHAIN REACTION is just the latest link.                                         
                                                                                
     Director Andrew Davis has lifted whole segments of CHAIN REACTION          
from another, better chase movie -- but at least he's had the good taste        
to steal from himself.  Aspects of this film are likely to remind even          
the most oblivious movie-goer of THE FUGITIVE, which Davis also                 
directed.  There's the man on the run, the supposed friend who's not as         
helpful as he first seems, and the lawman who, despite pursuing the             
protagonist, is actually on his side.                                           
                                                                                
     Unfortunately, the hero, Eddie Kasalivich, is played by Keanu              
Reeves, not Harrison Ford, and it's fair to say that the two are not in         
the same class as actors.  Eddie, a machinist, works at the University          
of Chicago on the "Hydrogen Energy Project".  The man in charge of the          
project, Paul Shannon (Morgan Freeman), seems like a nice, helpful              
person -- which probably means he's anything but that.  One night, while        
working late, Eddie arrives at the solution to a problem that has been          
plaguing the project since its inception.  Following this breakthrough,         
the scientists have at their fingertips a method of producing stable            
hydrogen from ordinary water -- "cheap, clean, abundant energy" which           
has the potential of making fossil fuels obsolete.  Someone, however,           
doesn't want the formula to get out, and they're willing to murder, not         
to mention destroy an eight-block area of Chicago's south side, to bury         
the secret.  Eddie soon finds himself, along with an attractive female          
physicist, Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz), framed for murder, and on the          
run from an FBI team led by the no-nonsense Inspector Ford (Fred Ward).         
                                                                                
     Yes, the plot contains some interesting elements, but, when all is         
said and done, they're only window dressing for the elaborate chase             
sequences.  This isn't a thought-provoking motion picture interested in         
exploring fertile territory; it's a reasonably straightforward action           
feature.  If you don't believe me, just count the number of explosions,         
gun shots, and fights.                                                          
                                                                                
     In its defense, CHAIN REACTION has an excellent first half hour.           
There's a satisfying explosion that levels a significant portion of             
south Chicago (although, based on the low number of casualties, this            
part of the city appears to be largely uninhabited) and a well-paced            
foot chase along Michigan Avenue that ends with a race up an opening            
draw bridge.  Unfortunately, after that, CHAIN REACTION settles into a          
comfortable, routine rhythm that lasts until the rousing conclusion.            
                                                                                
     As in SPEED, Reeves' acting limitations aren't a severe liability,         
since the part of Eddie doesn't require great range.  On the other hand,        
Rachel Weisz (one of the best things about STEALING BEAUTY) is                  
reasonably  impressive.  While Reeves' Eddie faces adversity with a             
blase attitude, Weisz' Lily appears frightened, bewildered, and                 
vulnerable.  The actress takes her token female sidekick role and               
develops a character of some substance out of it.  In fact, given the           
obvious constraints, it's hard to imagine anyone doing anything more            
with Lily.  Meanwhile, Morgan Freeman basically re-creates his OUTBREAK         
personae.  Freeman always has an arresting screen presence, but this            
isn't one of his more challenging parts.  Fred Ward, while no Tommy Lee         
Jones, is adequate as the sympathetic FBI agent.                                
                                                                                
     Aside from the lip service paid to the pros and cons of releasing          
free hydrogen onto the world market, CHAIN REACTION doesn't contain             
anything that we haven't already seen this summer.  The explosive               
destruction that wipes out a portion of Chicago looks like it could have        
been excised from INDEPENDENCE DAY.  The action sequences recall MISSION        
IMPOSSIBLE, ERASER, and THE ROCK, albeit with less energy.  The concept         
of government agents being bad guys has been used so often that it has          
long since turned into a tired cliche.  CHAIN REACTION isn't dull -- the        
film is paced to keep audiences attentive -- but the lack of originality        
dampens its enjoyability.  As a result, box office reaction will almost         
certainly be more like a spark than an explosion.

<a href="em.96.12.1.html"><b><B>The <I>Euromoney </I>top 50
financial leaders for the 21st century</b></a>

<br>
<font size=3>
 
Rohatyn, Mallinckrodt, Wallenberg, Bot&iacute;n, Sophonpanich, Li: familiar
names, but new faces as the second generation starts making its mark on the
financial community. <I>Euromoney </I>scoured the world for financial leaders
aged 40 and under and has come up with 50 names. Most, of course, are
first-generation financiers. Some are politicians. Many are already familiar;
more undoubtedly will be. One is already worth $10 billion.

<a href="em.96.12.2.html"><b> Deutsche Telekom </a></b><br>

<B>Telekom rules OK</B><br>

Three global coordinators, none of whom were on speaking terms by the end of
the deal. A political issuer which was much more interested in a high share price
than being nice to banks. A set of draconian rules and regulations for
participating banks which was then ignored by the <I>soi-disant </I>sole global
bookrunner. Not the smoothest of IPOs.<br> 
<I>Laura Covill</I>

<P> 

<a href="em.96.12.3.html"><B> Glass-Steagall  </a></B><BR>

<B>Chipping at the firewalls</B><br>

The Federal Reserve is going to change the face of US banking. It will
severely weaken the much-hated Glass-Steagall Act, opening the way for the kind
of mergers of banks with securities houses which have become commonplace in
Europe. It'll take a brave banker to act first, but DLJ, Lehman and even Merrill
Lynch are being looked at.<BR> 
<I>Michelle Celarier</I>

<P> 

<a href="em.96.12.4.html"><B> NatWest Markets </a></B><BR>

<B>Messy divorce in Hong Kong</B><br>

 NatWest does not have a very illustrious history in Hong Kong. The saga of
its ill-fated joint venture there, Wheelock NatWest, has left a sour taste in the
mouths of its partner, Wheelock, and its former employees. <br> 

<I>Steven Irvine</I>

<P> 

<a href="em.96.12.5.html"><B>Thailand </a></B><BR>

<B>Why the Big Mango stayed on the tree</B><br>

Bangkok &#173; the Big Mango &#173; was in a pretty precarious position for a
while. Somehow, Thailand's civil servants have averted another Mexico-style
crash. It's still too early to hope for a big comeback, however. The currency
needs to be floated first. <br>

<I>Gill Baker</I>

<P> 

<a href="em.96.12.6.html"><B>Asian banks </a></B><BR>

<B>Korea's pole position</B><br>

Korean banks dominate this year's ranking but the inclusion of Australian and
New Zealand banks has pushed them downwards. Japanese banks continue to post
losses. Fuji Bank lost more than $3 billion. <br>

<I>Rebecca Dobson</I>


<P> 

<a href="em.96.12.7.html"><B>Derivatives </a></B><BR>

<B>Swinging around the world</B><br>

Credit derivatives have come from nowhere over the past year to become the
hot new derivative product. But other instruments are also capturing the
imagination of increasingly sophisticated corporate treasurers, from the US to
Australia and Japan.  <br>

<I>Andy Webb</I>

<P> 

<a href="em.96.12.8.html"><B>European IPOs </a></B><BR>

<B>When it's time to leave home</B><br>

A lot of European family-owned companies have now reached the third
generation of owners. They want money, and European investors want equity. An IPO
is the obvious solution: it did wonders for Gucci. <I>Euromoney </I>profiles the
probables.<br> 

<I>James Featherstone </I>

<P> 

<B> Latin America</B><br>

<a href="em.96.12.9a.html"><B>The market likes the Latin look </a></B><BR>

The Mexico crisis didn't kill Latin America; rather, it seems to have made it
stronger. International sovereign bond issuance is at unprecedented levels, as
Latin economies become more fiscally prudent and western investors search
desperately for yield. <br>

<I>David Pilling </I>

<P> 

<a href="em.96.12.9b.html"><B>Seizing the moment </a></B><BR>

Latin American corporates may not be issuing in the quantities of their
sovereigns, but they certainly have pricing down to a fine art. <I>Euromoney
</I>takes a look at the biggest and best deals from around the region.<br>
 
<I>David Pilling </I>

<P> 

<a href="em.96.12.9c.html"><B>Crazy man in power </a></B><BR>

Abdala Bucaram spends as much time making pop records as running Ecuador. The
new president is popular in the country, but less so in the west.<br> 

<I>Norman Peagam</I>

<P> 

<a href="em.96.12.10.html"><B>European monetary union </a></B><BR>

<B>The outside view</B><br>

Will Emu come unglued? Even Asia is waking up to the possibilities: a weak
euro, and the marginalization of central Europe, Switzerland, Sweden and Norway.<br>

<B>THAILAND'S TROUBLES</B><BR>
<I><B>By Lance Knobel</I></B><br><br>

There is increasing speculation that the next financial crisis will not emerge in Latin America, which has hosted so many of the crises of recent decades, but in east Asia, which is better known for its economic miracle.<A HREF="http://http://www.emwl.com/contents/publications/euromoney/em.96/em.96.09/em.96.09.1.html">Euromoney's September cover story</A> on financial shocks picks Thailand as a possible candidate for an Asian version of the peso crisis.  <P>

Certainly this week's resignation of finance minister Bodi Chunnananda does nothing to soothe already battered financial markets. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the <A HREF="http://http://www.mof.go.th/">Thai Ministry of Finance's own site</A> remains silent on the latest turmoil. However, for those wishing to make up their own minds, there are useful resources on the Web: <P>

<A HREF="http://http://www.bot.or.th/">The Central Bank of Thailand</A> has a comprehensive site which includes the <A HREF="http://http://www.bot.or.th/findata.html">latest statistics</A> in downloadable files. The International Monetary Fund now provides an extremely helpful guide to all national statistics that subscribe to its <A HREF="http://http://dsbb.imf.org/">special data dissemination standards</A>, including <A HREF="http://http://dsbb.imf.org/country/thacats.htm">Thailand</A>.  <P>

Morgan Stanley's daily Global Economic Forum recently commented on Thailand's situation, focusing on the central bank's <A HREF="http://http://www.ms.com/GEFdata/digests/961008-tue.html#xtocid145046">curbs on capital inflows</A>. For a broader perspective on Thailand and the other so-called miracle economies of east Asia, it might be useful to refer back to Stanford University economist Paul Krugman's 1994 article <A HREF="http://http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~bpeter/krugman.htm">"The Myth of Asia's Miracle"</A> in Foreign Affairs. Krugman's controversial thesis is that east Asian growth is unsustainable because it has relied on growth in inputs of capital and labour, not on growth in total factor productivity.  <P>

Whatever financial tumult there may be, foreign direct investors have continued to have confidence in Thailand. Thailand's role as the centre of the southeast Asian auto industry was recently cemented by the decision of General Motors to build a <A HREF="http://http://www.bangkoknet.com/boi/sp3.html">US$700 million manufacturing plant</A> in the country. Thailand's readiness to welcome foreign investors was demonstrated by a package of incentives and the agreement to cancel the country's local content requirement on passenger cars from 1998. This contrasts with both Malaysia's and Indonesia's determination to encourage national car companies, rather than foreign.
<P>

To judge whether Euromoney's speculation of a Mexico-like crisis is plausible, University of California at Berkeley economist Brad De Long has a useful survey article of the <A HREF="http://http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/themexicanpesocrisis.html">peso crisis</A> on his Web site. The article includes links to other peso-related articles and sites on the Web. <P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<br>
</center>
The EMWL site has been developed by Euromoney and World Link magazines, with the aim of producing a sophisticated business and financial site on the world wide web. The content of both magazines is available on the site, along with research and surveys from both publications, capital markets league tables from Euromoney's proprietary databases Bondware and Loanware, interactive discussion forums, virtual round table discussions, and dates of forthcoming industry summits, conferences and seminars.
<br><br>
The aim of the site is not to reproduce the printed format of the magazines but to make available the above-mentioned content which can then be searched or browsed according to the user's requirements.
<br><br>
The design is geared towards low download times and ease of linking the different sections of the site. The content is divided in two ways, firstly, geographically so that visitors to the site can browse via the world map, selecting either a region or country of their choice and reading articles listed on those pages. Secondly the content is divided by category, for example, direct investment, government bonds, foreign exchange, banking technology, derivatives, and again, the user can select a category of interest and find relevant articles listed there.
<br><br>
Both the geographical and product sections will be sponsored by institutions with expertise in those areas. Users will be able to access information about the sponsor's activities within the EMWL site, and take advantage of embedded links to visit the sponsor's site directly from EMWL.
<br><br>
By providing links to other sites of relevance, EMWL users have access to a ready-made list of high-quality information sources at their fingertips. This will cut down time spent on more general searches across the Internet. Additionally, more efficient searching can be done using the internal search engine on the site. All material on the site, including all external links, is indexed to the search engine allowing users to explore both internal editorial from Euromoney Publications PLC and external links to other sites.
<br><br>
Also, part of the site is devoted to on-line discussions on various topics under the Alert section. Users can add their comments directly to an ongoing discussion, or alternatively suggest further topics and start a new one.
<br><br>
The editors of both magazines are contactable via email directly from the interactive section of the site, so if you have any comments on any of the articles, please go to the Alert section where you will find their contact details.
<br><br>
Once you have chosen a route, navigation tools at the bottom of each page will take you directly to the  sections without the necessity of drilling down through several layers of pages.
<br><br>
All material on the site is indexed to our search engine.
<br><br>
Please take a moment to send your feedback to the EMWL team via the Services section.
<br><br>
Thank you.

<b>How is the site structured?</b>
<br>
The site is divided into 4 sections: Contents, Alert, Search, Services. Their respective breakdowns are as follows:
<UL>
<li> <b>Contents:</b> contains the archives of the magazines available on the site via the Publications page; the Data section where you can find league tables from Euromoney's databases and research from Euromoney and World Link; Products where you can select a market sector and browse the site to find articles relating to that sector and the lastly, the World Map which can be used to browse the site geographically.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Alert:</b> the interactive part of the site, this is where you will find the Discussion Forums which are constantly being updated, the Letters to the Editors area where you can post comments straight through to the editors of Euromoney and World Link magazines, the Site Updates - have a quick look here to find out what is new to the EMWL site, Latest News section with the regular columns from the magazines, the Diary of Events where you can see what conferences and seminars we are holding and also see the dates of the World Economic Forum summits, and the list of external links to the Sponsors' sites and internal links to their pages within our site.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Search:</b> the full text search facility will search all pages in the site to provide you with a list of sources of information.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Services:</b> if you have any comments or problems or wish to contact us, the Services section contains the Feedback, FAQs and staff contact details.
</ul>
<br>

<b>Which Magazines are avaliable from the site?</b>
<br>
The entire editorial contents of both Euromoney and World Link magazines is available on the site. We also have the cover stories from other Euromoney titles like Corporate Finance, Euroweek and Global Investor. All the magazines can be accessed via the Publications button in the Contents section of the site.
<br><br>

<b>How is the site updated?</b>
<br>
EMWL uses Beyond Press to convert most of its Quark Express magazine articles into HTML.  The HTML articles are then fed through custom built software that places the pages in their correct positions on the site.

<b>Which browser should I use?</b>
<br>
You should use a browser that supports JavaScripting to get the most out of EMWL.  The site is optimised for Netscape 2.0, but can be fully appreciated by all browsers that support tables.
<br><br>

<b>Why am I having problems opening some of the Euromoney Research articles?</b>
<br>
The research files contain a lot of data and are consequently very large files. Furthermore, some files not only contain large amounts of data, laid out in tables (particularly in the 'Data Section'), which further increases the download time. There is no real solution to the problem, EMWL strives to provide quality information, and this may require your patience in some instances. Try increasing the memory allocation for your browser.

</td>
<td align=left valign=top>
<b>How do I download the tables?</b>
<br>
You can download tables in two ways.  You can select all the data in the table, using your computer's cursor, and copy the text.  Then, if you open up a spreadsheet program on your computer, such as Excel, you can paste the data into a table.  The alternative is to simply save the page onto your hard drive, but this is a less reliable method of keeping all the data in their respective columns.
<br><br>
<b>How do I save articles?</b>
<br>
Use your browser to save articles onto your hard drive.

<H3> COUNTRY RISK RATING 1996 </H3>


<H2> <B>Asia's economies  start to slip</B> </H2> 

<P>

<a href="em.96.09.10a.html"> Country Risk Rating 1996 </b></a>

<P>

<a href="em.96.09.10b.html"> Global economic projections </b></a>

<P>

<H4> <B>In <I>Euromoney</I>'s
semi-annual ranking of country creditworthiness, the winners are the emerging
countries of east and central Europe. But south-east Asian economies &#173; and
even Japan &#173; are looking riskier, as debt ratios worsen and monetary
instability spreads. Commentary by Rebecca Dobson</B> </H4> 

<P> The results look
encouraging for eastern Europe and Latin America; they look worrying for Asia.

<P> Every six months, <I>Euromoney</I> polls economists and political analysts
for their views on the creditworthiness of almost 170 countries around the world.
To that, we add an array of quantitative data, from debt ratios to access to
capital markets (see page 205 for detailed methodology). The result is a
sensitive measure of the riskiness of investing in these economies.

<P> This month's rating justifies the growing perception that Asia is become
economically mature and more politically unstable. On average, the Asian
countries have slipped in the ranking by 2.5 places. Political tensions explain
the fall in Indonesia, down two places from March's ranking to 41. The recent run
on the baht and concerns about a build-up in short-term debt are behind the
four-place drop of Thailand to 30. Japan falls even further &#173; from fourth to
12th  &#173; as its economy, which earlier in the year looked to be recovering,
slides back into stagnation. Our economists predict that growth in GDP will
decline to 2.2% in 1997, down from an estimated 3.1% this year.

<P> The only rising economies in Asia, it seems, are in Indochina. Vietnam rises
three places to 63, partly as a result of its membership of Asean; it is also
expected to debut in the international bond market next year. Even Cambodia rises
10 places, although it remains lowly-ranked at 109.

<P> The beneficiaries are mostly in eastern and central Europe, as the reform
programmes put in place since the fall of Communism begin to bear fruit. The
biggest riser in the region is Slovenia, which is now seen as fractionally more
creditworthy than the Czech Republic.  Its economy is expected to grow by more
than 4% both this year and next. Poland, though, is forecast to produce the
fastest growth in central Europe this year and next &#173; more than 5% a year.
As a result, it moves up three places.

<P> Russia, despite its continuing economic problems, is a fast-improving credit
too. As recently as last September it ranked a lowly 142. In March it rose to
100; now it is 86. Boris Yeltsin's re-election removed some of the political
uncertainty, although his heart operation &#173; announced after our poll was
conducted &#173; will inevitably increase it again.

<P> The Baltic States have also improved, particularly Lithuania, the highest
ranked of the three, which rises 26 places to 59th. All three countries now have
access to the international bond market. Their economies are looking healthy too:
all are expected to show solid growth next year.

<P> The evidence of the Country Risk Ranking is that confidence in Latin American
countries has recovered remarkably since last year's Mexican peso crisis. Mexico
is up to 52nd from 57th this time last year. Its economy is expected to
accelerate to 3.5% growth in 1997. The other major economies, Brazil and
Argentina, both rise three places. The most spectacular rises, though, are in the
region's smaller economies: Panama moves up 14 to 69, Peru up six to 73,
Venezuela up nine to 78, and Ecuador up eight to 80.

<P> Sub-Saharan African countries countries continue to lose ground, with
Botswana down 10 to 65 and Zimbabwe down five to 76. South Africa can consider
itself lucky to rise one place in the ranking to 48, despite the disastrous
decline in the rand over the past six months.

<P> <I>Research by Rebecca Dobson and Cara Solomon</I>

<H2> <B>Methodology</B> </H2> <P> The <I>Euromoney</I> country risk assessment
uses nine categories that fall into<B> </B>three broad groups: analytical
indicators, credit indicators and market indicators. The weighted scores are
calculated as follows: the highest score in each category receives the full mark
for the weighting; the lowest receives zero. In between, figures are calculated
according to the formula: Final score = weighting/(maximum score &#173; minimum
score) x (score<B> </B>&#173; minimum score). The country risk ranking shows only
the final scores after weighting.

<P> The categories are:

<P> *&#009;<B>Economic data </B>(25% weighting). Taken from the <I>Euromoney</I>
global economic projections 1996&#173;97 (see page **). Each country scores the
average of the evaluations for 1996 and 1997.

<P> *&#009;<B>Political risk </B>(25%). <I>Euromoney</I> polled risk analysts,
risk insurance brokers and bank credit officers. They were asked to give each
country a score of between zero and 10. A score of 10 indicates no risk of
non-payment; zero indicates that there is no chance of payments being made.
Countries were scored in comparison both with each other and with previous years.
Country risk was defined as the risk of non-payment or non-servicing of payment
for goods or services, loans, trade-related finance and dividends, and the
non-repatriation of capital. This category does not reflect the creditworthiness
of individual counterparties in any country.

<P> *&#009;<B>Debt indicators </B>(10%). Scores are calculated using the
following ratios from the <I>World Bank World Debt Tables 1995-96:</I> debt
service to exports (A); current-account balance to GNP (B); external debt to GNP
(C). Figures are the latest available, mostly for 1993. Scores are calculated by
the formula: C+(Ax2)&#173;(Bx10). The higher the score, the better.

<P> Because of the lack of consistent economic data for OECD and rich
oil-producing countries, these score full points with the exception of Developing
countries that do not report debt data to the World Bank score zero.

<P> *&#009;<B>Debt in default or rescheduled </B>(10%). <BR> A score of between
zero and 10 based on the amount of debt in default or that has been rescheduled
over the past three years. Ten equals no non-payments; zero, all in default or
rescheduled. Scores are based on the <I>World Bank World Debt Tables 1995-96
</I>and<I> Euromoney </I>estimates for countries which do not report under the
debtor reporting system (DRS).

<P> *&#009;<B>Credit ratings</B> (10%). The average of sovereign ratings from
Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and IBCA.

<P> *&#009;<B>Access to bank finance</B> (5%). Calculated from disbursements of
private, long-term, unguaranteed loans as a percentage of GNP. OECD countries
which do not report under the debtor reporting system (DRS) score 5. Source:
<I>World Bank World Debt Tables 1995-96.</I>

<P> *&#009;<B>Access to short-term finance</B> (5%). Scores are calculated taking
into account coverage available from US Exim Bank, NCM UK and ECGD and membership
of OECD consensus groups.

<P> *&#009;<B>Access to international bond and syndicated loan markets</B> (5%).
Reflects <I>Euromoney</I>'s<I> </I>analysis of how easily the country might <BR>
tap the markets now, based largely on issues since January 1995. A score of five
means no problem whatsoever; four, no problem on 95% of occasions; three, usually
no problem; two, possible (depending on conditions); one, just possible in some
circumstances; zero, impossible.

<P> *&#009;<B>Access to and discount on forfaiting</B> (5%). Reflects the average
maximum tenor available and the forfaiting spread over riskless countries such as
the US, based on the average maximum tenor minus the spread. Countries for which
forfaiting is not available score nothing. Data were supplied by Morgan Grenfell
Trade Finance, West Merchant Bank, the London Forfaiting Company, Standard Bank
and ING Capital.

<H2> <B>Economic projections</B> </H2> <P> <I>Euromoney</I> received replies from
20 economists at leading financial and economic institutions. They gave each
country's economic performance a score out of 100, after making comparisons
between countries and years. The world's fastest-growing, best-performing economy
in an ideal year would score 100; the worst economy in a disastrous year would
score zero. The economists were asked to look at sustained economic growth,
monetary stability, current-account/budget deficit or surplus, unemployment and
structural imbalances.

<P> Respondents also gave their forecasts of real GNP growth for calendar years
1996 and 1997. The scores in the ranking are the average of those forecasts.

<P> <I>Our thanks go to the 35 political analysts and economists who took part in
our economic projections and political risk survey. Those who did not wish to
remain anonymous were:</I>

d'Epargne de l'Etat; R Shields, Chase Manhattan Bank; A Astrow, Economist

<H3>POLL OF POLLS</H3> 
<H2>On top of the world </H2>
<H4>Which were the world's most successful investment banks last year? <I>Euromoney</I>'s
unique poll of polls has the answers. The winners: Merrill and SBC Warburg.
And a wooden spoon for Goldman Sachs, which slips from first to fourth.
By Charles Piggott </H4>
<I>Euromoney</I>'s poll of polls proves it: 1995 was the year of the universal
bank. The winners in this year's poll - based on a compilation of 70
<I>Euromoney </I>polls and league tables produced during 1995 - were
the banks which merged during the year. The repackaged Merrill Lynch and
Smith New Court, Swiss Bank and SG Warburg, and Dresdner Bank and Kleinwort
Benson all feature prominently in the ranking. <BR>
<BR>
Merrill Lynch ranks top in the poll after its acquisition of UK brokerage
house Smith New Court. Merrill has finally made it to the top after two
years in second place behind Goldman Sachs. Smith New Court's main contribution
to Merrill Lynch's overall score was in equity and economic research, and
equity trading. <BR>
<BR>
SBC Warburg comes a close second, following the acquisition by Swiss Bank
Corporation of SG Warburg. While both SG Warburg and SBC are strong in underwriting
(last year SG Warburg ranked seventh in underwriting and SBC eighth) they
are less evenly balanced in trading and advisory work. Last year SG Warburg
failed to rank in the trading category, while SBC came third. Conversely,
SBC failed to rank in the advisory category where SG Warburg ranked third.
<BR>
<BR>
The combination of Dresdner and Kleinwort Benson enters the top 20 for the
first time. Dresdner on its own scored 73.14, Kleinwort Benson 71.2. The
results suggest that the combined Dresdner Kleinwort Benson will be stronger
in the primary markets than in the secondary markets, and that Kleinwort
Benson will take the leading role in research and advisory work. <BR>
<BR>
UK banks BZW and the HSBC Group rise in the ranking. BZW climbs from 12th
to seventh on the strength of gains made in Eurobond syndication and fee-based
advisory work, while HSBC's investment banking subsidiaries, HSBC Markets,
Montagu, Capel and Trinkaus, are beginning to look less fragmented as the
group moves up from 15th to 10th. <BR>
<BR>
But not all restructurings have had an immediate impact. Efforts by Deutsche
Bank and Credit Suisse to improve their investment banking subsidiaries
have yet to contribute to their positions in the ranking. CS First Boston
falls from sixth to ninth overall. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell falls from eighth
to 12th following a less successful year in underwriting. But its score
improved in other areas: it moved up two places to ninth in trading, and
entered the top 20 in the advisory category for the first time. <BR>
<BR>
The big losers in the poll are Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs. Lehman
falls from fourth to eighth in the overall table and from sixth to 17th
in the advisory table. Goldman Sachs, which ranked number one in 1993 and
1994, falls to fourth. Staff cuts and defections, which followed mistakes
made in the bond market in the spring of 1994, have damaged Goldman's previously
high reputation for research and underwriting. Goldman Sachs slips from
first to third in trading, second to fourth in underwriting and first to
fourth in the advisory category. <BR>
<BR>
Chemical Bank comes just outside the top 20 in 21st place with a score of
80.57. Once the merger with Chase Manhattan is completed this spring, the
combined bank should make it comfortably into the top 20. A combined score
in the present ranking would have placed the merged bank 13th. Other banks
just below the top 20 are: Bank of America (total score: 62.44), Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale (62.17), PaineWebber (59.32), ING Barings (54.75),
Hambros (54.67), Standard Chartered (50.13), Nikko Securities (47.79), Caisse
des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts et Consignations (43.39) and CIBC Wood Gundy (39.64).

<H2>Strongest banks of the world </H2>
<H3>Large-scale mergers and the decision by Japan's Sumitomo Bank to bite
the bullet over provisioning have brought about the major changes in this
year's rankings. The new Chase has rocketed to ninth position while Sumitomo
has fallen from first to sixth. Antony Currie reports </H3>
After four years as the largest bank in the world, Sumitomo Bank of Japan
has finally been knocked off the top spot in this year's survey. Since it
is the first major Japanese bank so far to announce provisions for bad debt,
this is hardly surprising - it announced losses of $3.2 billion in 1995,
the first Japanese bank ever to record a deficit. The slight fall in capital
(0.42%) drops Sumitomo to sixth place in the rankings. <BR>
<BR>
With the merger of Mitsubishi and Bank of Tokyo not taking effect until
April 1 1996 (and thus too late for inclusion in our rankings), HSBC's $26,665
million equity figures put it in first place. The UK-based bank also made
the most profits last year with $3.8 billion, nearly a billion dollars more
than its nearest rival, Chase - newly formed from the merger of Chemical
Bank and Chase Manhattan and now America's largest bank. <BR>
<BR>
A glance over the rest of the top 200 shows that the banking industry is
continuing along a healthy path. All the top 10 have recorded market capital
of $20 billion or more, 21 banks made a profit of over $1 billion, and only
two banks reported a loss in 1995. <BR>
<BR>
Another characteristic of the last 12 months has been mergers among several
of the top banks. In addition to the Chase-Chemical marriage, First Chicago
and NBD Corporation joined forces in the US and now stand at 42 in the world
rankings, five places behind the newly merged Lloyds and TSB bank group
in the UK. The equity of Halifax Building Society, also from the UK, soared
to $10.1 billion after its merger with Leeds Permanent Building Society.
In Switzerland the rumours of a merger between UBS and CS Holding came to
nothing, although a merger between two of the big three Swiss banks - Swiss
Bank Corporation being the third - still cannot be ruled out. Undoubtedly
mergers will continue to affect the rankings over the course of the next
12 months. <BR>
<BR>
This year, in conjunction with Eurastar (see methodology box), we have managed
to expand our rankings to include a total of 1,249 banks from 134 countries
- 23 more than last year. Countries being listed for the first time come
from all continents. They including El Salvador, Macau, Mozambique and Angola,
as well as former eastern bloc states such as Albania, Estonia, Armenia
and Belarus. <BR>
<BR>
One country worthy of note is Portugal, whose banking industry has consolidated
into several groupings. The main one is the Champalimaud group which comprises
Banco Totta &amp; Acores, Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor and Credito Predial
Portugues. Also, Banco Comercial Portugues has grouped with Banco Portugues
do Atlantico, Banco Fomento &amp; Exterior with Banco Borges &amp; Irmao,
and Banco Portugues do Investimento has teamed up with Banco Fonsecas &amp;
Burnay. Because most have yet to report their 1995 results, and because
not all the groupings are mergers or takeovers, we have printed the banks
according to last year's tables. <BR>
<BR>
The banking sector in Lebanon - one of the strongest before the civil wars
and invasions of the last 20 years - is growing rapidly. The figures for
1994 (the latest available) show the top four banks recording equity growth
of over 100%, with that of Cr&eacute;dit Libanais at 366%. Assets have also
grown significantly, although the gains have not been as dramatic as with
equity. <BR>
<BR>
In Mexico, by contrast, the 1995 figures indicate a general drop in equity,
assets and profits as a result of the debt crisis that hit the country at
the beginning of last year. We rank our analysis by shareholder's equity
- measured in accordance with the tier one requirements laid down by the
Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland - because it is generally
regarded as a more reliable means of gauging a bank's inherent strength
than assets. <BR>
<BR>
But, as was mentioned in last year's analysis, banks can be overcapitalized,
and the growing trend to rectify this with share buy-backs might prove difficult
to measure by our ranking method. <BR>
<BR>
Five major banks have announced buy-back plans in the last year - BankAmerica,
Citicorp, Wells Fargo and First Bank System in the US, and Barclays in the
UK - yet all have seen a rise in market capitalization because stock markets
tend to look favourably on those businesses which have learnt from the excesses
of the 1980s and treat their capital with more caution. <HR>
<H2>Definitions </H2>
<I>Shareholders' equity</I> is the sum of the following, as applied by the
regulatory authorities of each country: common stock, preferred stock, surplus/premium,
statutory reserve, legal reserve, revaluation reserve, retained earnings,
profit not distributed and minority interest. Treasury stock and dividends
payable are subtracted from the total. Subordinated debt and non-capital
reserves, such as untaxed reserves, are excluded. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Total assets</I> are as reported in financial statements, net of contra
accounts. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Net income</I> is as reported in financial statements, after taxes, when
possible, and includes extraordinary items. In addition, net income is before
untaxed allocation to reserves, in line with the regulations in each country.
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Return on equity</I> is calculated using total capital funds, which in
addition to shareholders' equity include for example qualified subordinated
debentures and reserve for loan loss. <HR>
<H2>Methodology </H2>
<B><BR>
The rankings in the <I>Euromoney </I>Bank Atlas were compiled from the Eurabank
database, as supplied by the Eurastar division of Sleigh Corporation, Franklin
Lakes, New Jersey, USA. For further information regarding</B> <B>the Eurabank
database,</B> <B>please call +1 201 405 1800.<BR>
</B> <BR>
All institutions whose primary business is taking deposits are eligible
for inclusion. Figures are presented, where possible, in consolidated form,
including data from non-banking activities. Banks which are owned by other
financial institutions are not listed separately, but are consolidated in
the parent's figures. Banking groups are limited, however, to those organizations
where the parent holds management control over the subsidiaries. <BR>
<BR>
The information in the survey comes from either banks' consolidated annual
reports or a detailed questionnaire sent out by <I>Euromoney</I> in early
April. <HR>

BOND TRADING</H3>

<H2>
A hiring frenzy for Eurobond traders
</H2>
<H4>
It's a good time to be a Eurobond trader. European banks such as Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and SBC Warburg are beefing up their trading rooms and are prepared to double or treble the earnings of top traders to bring them on board. But just how talented are the traders jumping ship for such high sums? Ronan Lyons reports</B>
</H4>

"I want to see a continuous commitment to the market from a firm before I consider moving to it," says a Eurobond trader with two years' experience. "Well, either that or $500,000 a year, guaranteed for two years." 

<P>
These are heady times for Eurobond traders, caught in a spiral of salary increases sparked by the latest firms to make an assault on the market. But the age-old nostrum of the bond markets, buyer beware, could equally apply to banks on a recruitment spree.

<P>
The recruitment merry-go-round for Eurobond traders appears to have spun out of control. Simon Fry, Stefan Ludwig and John Carroll set a new benchmark for Eurobond traders' salaries in November 1994 when they moved from CS First Boston to Nomura for a reputed total of $20 million over three years.  Since then the market hasn't looked back.

<P>
"Eurobond traders are enjoying a mini Big Bang," says one trader at a Japanese firm. The beginning of the year usually heralds a lull in movements as traders await their bonuses. But the Rose Partnership, a recruitment consultant, had its most profitable quarter ever at the beginning of 1996, largely on the back of the hiring frenzy for Eurobond traders. 

<P>
Edson Mitchell's arrival at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell from Merrill as head of global fixed income presaged an exodus from the US house to DMG. But Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's tentacles extend way beyond Merrill. The German bank has hired 50 people from Goldman Sachs alone over the past year.

<P>
"Until a year ago we had very little turnover of staff on a our trading floor," says Stephen Gallagher, managing director for debt markets at Merrill. All that changed when DMG started its hiring spree. "They approach my traders, ask them what they earn and then offer to double it," says Gallagher. "We won't compete. Unlike the commercial banks, we have a minimum return-on-equity requirement. The firm aims to make a 15% return-on-equity per business."

<P>
In the past Deutsche Morgan Grenfell was regarded as a low payer. Not any more. It has hired 200 staff over the past six months and plans to hire another 200. In the process it has pushed up salaries for Eurobond traders to unprecedented levels.

<P>
Traders are being offered a basic salary with a bonus of 200%&#173;300% of this amount guaranteed. In 1994 and 1995 traders were being offered 100% guarantees or no guarantee at all. "There's a dearth of good traders, which means the established ones can name their price," says one recruitment consultant. "No new blood has come along in the past two years because most banks cut back on graduate recruitment in 1994."

<P>
Typically, there are three or four top traders in each firm who make the bulk of its profits. This creates a two-tier labour market in London. On top, there's a rarefied tier of elite traders commanding salaries of over $750,000 a year; below them is a rump of mediocre traders scraping by on $300,000.

<P>
"The same 100 names keep coming up when I set about filling vacancies for Eurobond traders," says the recruitment consultant. "It's a sellers' market for Eurobond traders. Those with two years' experience have been asking for &#173; and getting &#173; salaries of $600,000. Recently a trader phoned me to tell me he was leaving Salomon; I had six interviews arranged for him within half an hour." 

<P>
CS First Boston has been gutted of its senior traders, while the firm's strategic incoherence heightens the restlessness among those remaining. The experience of Peter Knoll is a case in point. Knoll, a Eurolira trader known among his peers as Barnie Rubble, moved from Lehman to CS First Boston only months before CS First Boston pulled out of the Eurolira market. 

<P>
Even the venerable Morgan Stanley has been hit by the frenzied recruitment market for traders. "It's difficult to find good traders and salespeople," says Jim O'Brien, head of Eurobond trading at Morgan Stanley. "I've had traders snatched away with offers to double their compensation." However, with a note of hubris, O'Brien claims that Morgan Stanley does not need to hire traders who can bring investors with them: "Our clients want to do business with Morgan Stanley, not with an individual." For its part, Morgan Stanley will not offer a guarantee unless it recruits a trader mid-year.

<P>
Indeed, Morgan Stanley is said to pay its traders at a 20% discount to the going rate, purely because it is Morgan Stanley. "I know that Morgan Stanley will be here in 10 years' time, not like one of these bucket-shop Eurobond houses that have been springing up lately," says one trader at the bank.

<P>
But a fatalistic resolve is increasingly evident among trading-desk managers at US firms. "Two years ago we thought that Deutsche Morgan Grenfell would buy one of the smaller US houses, such as Lehman or Salomon Brothers," says one. "But instead they've bought staff. We can't compete with the salaries being offered. Too often lately I've had to take off my manager's hat and let traders depart on amicable terms because I know that they've been made an offer they can't refuse."

<P>
<B>Gossip-in-trade</B>

<P>
Spreading misinformation about the revenues traders generate might be a wise counter-strategy. The labour market for traders is driven by gossip. Firms often base their judgements on who to hire on reputation rather than performance, because an outsider has no way of knowing how much a trader earns for his current employer.

<P>
Relying on inter-dealer brokers for information is misleading, because they can know only what a bank's turnover is, not what its profits are. UBS is said to have poached traders from Wood Gundy who had booked a loss the previous year. Also, a trader's performance must be seen in the context of the firm he works for. A trader who earns $2 million profit at Paribas is probably as good as a trader at Goldman Sachs &#173; a more prestigious firm &#173; who earns $5 million.

<P>
Rising salaries are not the by-product of rising bond-trading revenues at investment banks. Although volumes in the Eurobond secondary market (as measured by Euroclear and Cedel) are at an all-time high, the intensity of competition is beginning to bite into returns. Some 40% of Eurobond staff in London received no bonus last year. For most traders, that is tantamount to receiving a dismissal notice. In 1993 Morgan Stanley made $40 million trading corporate Eurobonds. In 1995 it made nothing. 

<P>
"Most houses have had two years of below-budget profits, using 1993 as a benchmark," says Fred Orleans, head of Eurobond trading at Lehman. These sentiments are echoed round the City. "It's as difficult to make $10 million dollars as it was 10 years ago," says Simon Meadows, head of Eurobond trading at CS First Boston. But remuneration has remained at 1993 levels, despite the falling profitability.

<P>
Over the past two years Salomon Brothers, under duress from Warren Buffett, its leading shareholder, sought to cut the bonuses it awards to traders. But the policy was abandoned because employees were being lured away by higher pay offers from rival firms. 

<P>
Much of the excess competition in the secondary bond market stems from the growing aggressiveness of European commercial banks such as Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and SBC Warburg in the primary market.

<P>
The big US investment banks all complain about the distorting effects of commercial banks hurling money at the primary market. "Commercial banks are in the top 10 or 15 of the new-issue league tables because they've been willing to pay for their presence," says the head of Eurobond trading at one US firm. "While the American banks are there are on merit, commercial banks got there by buying arbitrage issues from [borrowers such as] German Landesbanks which want to hit their borrowing targets." Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, SBC Warburg, UBS, ABN Amro, HSBC and BZW are all cited as culprits. "They'll book a million-dollar loss by launching an issue at <BR>
5-10 basis points off what most would be prepared to pay, just to push their name up the league table," says the trading chief at the US firm. 

<P>
Says Gallagher at Merrill: "Buying market share seems to be the way forward. But only high-quality primary business &#173; and by this I mean doing business at the right price &#173; breeds the same in the secondary market. Our trading desk is a separate profit centre. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and SBC Warburg run their businesses on a different basis." Gallagher believes that some commercial banks provide a negative budget for their syndicate and trading desks, viewing them as a loss leader. 

<P>
<B>Indirect benefits</B>

<P>
Origination managers are under pressure to win deals, many of which will be dumped on brokers via the secondary desk. "Being the best house in new issues just means building up more inventories than any other," says Ronnie Dicks, a managing director at PaineWebber. So, an aggressively priced issue can be bad news for the lead manager's trading desk. 

<P>
Many firms don't expect their traders to be much more than a support for the primary desk. "Only five or six firms expect to make any money from Eurobond trading," says Sion Kearsey, head of Eurobond trading at Goldman Sachs. There are, however, indirect benefits that may be reaped from secondary trading through information-gathering and the ability to place issues in the market at tighter spreads.

<P>
The US investment banks are keen to stress their different approach to bond trading. "The key difference to us is the lack of a risk culture at the commercials when trading with their own capital," says the head of Eurobond trading at one US firm. "Our strength is our appetite for risk." The inference is that the men in the trenches at the commercial banks may have changed, but the generals back at base are as out of touch as ever. 

<P>
Without a hint of irony, the US firms also point to the disruptive influence of the pursuit of money as the common denominator among new workmates. "When the unifying force among new recruits is money, problems ensue," says Orleans at Lehman. "Individuals pursuing their own agendas create a strategic myopia. Global banking requires the coordination of various interests. A global bond will be traded in three centres and possibly out of two P&amp;Ls. And when a trader knows that one of his colleagues is being paid three times as much as him, it creates tensions."

The success of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and SBC Warburg proves that it is possible to build up a successful trading operation in a fairly short time. The standard bulge-bracket rhetoric that customer relations in the secondary market can be established only one trade at a time seems hollow. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell is making inroads into the business by poaching what it regards as the cream of Eurobond traders. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell has gutted Merrill's talent. "[Edson] Mitchell has gone for the best," says Dicks of PaineWebber. "He knows who he wants and he wants them quickly."

<P>
When a bank ploughs so much money into recruitment its seems inevitable that it will hire too many staff and pay them too much money. But having weighed up the cost of this strategy against the cost of buying a bank, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell concluded that it was cheaper. And few would deny that the bank has come a long way in a short space of time. One trader at Goldman Sachs who worked at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell for two years winces when he recounts his experience there. "The bank was a joke when I was there," he says. "It was an also-ran, riddled with fiefdoms."

<P>
"We've been the sleeping giant of the Eurobond sector," says David Campbell, co-head of fixed-income at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "All we are doing is unleashing our potential." Campbell rejects any suggestion that the bank is paying above-market rates to traders. Indeed, he claims that overall staff costs have fallen. "The key change at the bank has been an internal redistribution of resources," he says. Last year, for example, it integrated its asset-swap business (having lost the cream of its talent to WestLB) with its Eurobond market-making operation, bringing it into line with its main competitors.

<P>
SBC Warburg has adopted a more cautious recruitment strategy, improving the quality of its staff rather than expanding it. However, it too is prepared to buy. "We hired 6,000 people when we bought SBC Warburg," says Stephen West, managing director at SBC Warburg for international bond trading and sales.

<P>
<B>Degrees of excess</B>

<P>
The label of "commercial bank" is an anachronism believes West. He prefers to call them capital-based banks.

<P>
"The distinction between investment and commercial banks is no longer valid," he says. "SBC Warburg is bigger and better capitalized than any of the US houses." Unlike CS First Boston or Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, SBc Warburg has put traders on its board &#173; six of them in total. 

<P>
West is dismissive of the sniping of US banks: "We see the Eurobond market as another area in which we can make a return on our capital, which we can raise more cheaply than any of the US houses." US investment banks have exported domestically honed skills to the Eurobond market, and to this West attributes their traditional dominance. But times have changed. "On the Tuesday before Easter I was chatting to a trader at Lehman who said they'd had a quiet day, having written about 30 tickets in dollars," says a Eurodollar trader at SBC Warburg. "We had written over 500 that day."

<P>
Jostling on the periphery of the market are Japanese firms such as Nomura. The Japanese have made proprietary trading their first objective, with development of a customer base coming a distant second. They have strong distribution channels at home but pose little threat to established houses in dollar or Deutschmark markets.

<P>
However, there is growing pool of traders who demand a percentage of any profits they make, a claim that many Japanese houses are willing to meet. Sumitomo, for example, is offering a percentage deal as well as a guarantee, which leaves no downside risk but unlimited potential upside returns for the trader. "Rather than seeking to build a long-term business, these houses are using their capital to punt on the Eurobond market," says one former trader at a Japanese house. At Tokai, for example 98% of revenue comes from risk-taking, compared with 20% at Lehman. "Tokai is running a hedge fund, not a secondary trading desk," says the trader. "They're not looking to develop business that will generate an annuity stream." 

<P>
By contrast, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell seems to have made a long-term decision to increase the salaries it pays to its traders. "It doesn't matter that Deutsche Morgan Grenfell is paying so much to its traders, if the whole is greater than the sum of the parts," says the head of Eurobond trading at a rival firm. "It's building a strong team of traders, and at the same time sapping talent from its rivals."

<P>
But whether or not Deutsche Morgan Grenfell is paying its traders too much remains a moot point. "We're all paid too much," says one trader. "It's all a matter of degree";

Gone are the days when the stereotypical foul-mouthed and filthy-rich bond trader would guzzle five pints of lager at lunchtime and sober up in time to catch the 5:15 train home from Waterloo.

Tight margins have tempered arrogance, and the decline of head-to-head (interbank) trading affords less of an opportunity for ritualistic bragging. "Traders have to put in the hours now because the competition is so much stiffer," says veteran trader Ronnie Dicks, a managing director at PaineWebber. "In the past a trader could just trade his book. But of late they've been besieged by customers who want to see research."

<P>
So what makes the 1990s' trader better than average? "Good traders are product managers," says Dicks. "They sell to salesman. A trader can't survive without airtime from salespeople. Lately, I've even seen traders going for a drink after work with salesmen." 

<P>
But the demeanour of the trader depends on the strategy of his employer. "At [Japanese bank] Tokai, because the trading is mostly proprietary, a trader can have the interpersonal skills of a slug and just sit in the corner and make money," says one former employee of the firm. "But at one of the top houses, traders have to be able to sell to salespeople and sometimes even meet customers."

<P>
One of the traders interviewed for this article points at the two computers on his desk and exclaims: "I can't use these damn things, but I don't need to because I have gut instincts." Sadly, these sentiments may mark the death gasp of a dinosaur. The demands placed on traders have risen as banks have consolidated their Eurobond operations.

<P>
"I've been trading sterling, dollars and Ecu," says a Eurobond trader at CS First Boston. "So I had to master complex spreadsheet packages quickly." 

<P>
<B>Analytical skills</B>

<P>
The Cockney barrow boy with little formal education but a head for figures is a thing of the past. "My traders all have degrees," says the head of Eurobond trading at one US firm. "Some of them can even work out the yield on a bond."

<P>
The analytical skills demanded of traders have grown immeasurably. "Credit risk is becoming more important in Europe as people move away from equities," says Sion Kearsey, head of Eurobond trading at Goldman Sachs. Rival firms strike a similar note. "My main concern when interviewing traders is how well they understand credit," says Jim O'Brien, head of Eurobond trading at Morgan Stanley.

<P>
When the Eurobond market took off in the 1980s, the traders who made the most money were expert at the cut and thrust of head-to-head trading. "At Salomon in the 1980s there was head-to-head trading in every market," says Simon Meadows, head of Eurobond trading at CS First Boston and a former Salomon trader. In 1996, however, most houses will make markets only in lira or French francs. "We thought we had to make markets," adds Meadows. "But all we were doing was creating a false liquidity. Investors don't call traders any more and say 'make me a market'. They call brokers and say 'what have you got'." 

<P>
In the past, firms with little distributive capacity and a small capital base could make markets against the big US houses. But as the market in dollars, Deutschmarks and <BR>
sterling grew it became apparent that head-to-head trading wasn't needed for liquidity. In 1996 most transactions go through brokers.

<P>
The Eurobond market has polarized into specialist and niche markets over the past three years and even the high-volume business requires fewer traders. CS First Boston has seen the number of its Eurodollar traders fall from nine to three, while the number at Merrill Lynch has fallen from 12 to three. "When I look back I can't see what all of those 12 guys were doing," says one trader at Merrill. <B></B><BR><BR><BR>

<H2>The <I>Euromoney</I> bond traders' poll</H2>


Which house is best at trading Deutschmark Eurobonds, Swiss government bonds or illiquid Ecu bonds? Here are the answers according to the competition. The poll results are based on replies received from 41 Eurobond and government bond traders. Voters were asked to name the three top houses in each category. Three points were awarded for a first place, two for a second and one for a third.

<P>
In the overall tables, the following weightings were applied to banks' scores to reflect the variation in size and importance of the various Eurobond and government-bond markets:

<P>
Eurobonds: weighted by turnover as reported by Euroclear and Cedel for 1995 and 1996 to date, and by volume of outstanding Eurobonds in each currency (source: Euromoney Bondware).

<P>
Government bonds: weighted by Salomon Brothers World Government Bond Index.

<P>
To appear in the overall rankings a bank must have been nominated in at least four <BR>
categories.

<P>
Voters were requested not to nominate their own institutions. This meant that it became an advantage for an institution not to take part in the survey (thereby not having to vote for anyone else). Of those institutions which feature prominently in the rankings, BNP, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs declined to vote. Their scores have accordingly been reduced by 10% in each category.

<H3>PRIVATIZATION POLL</H3>
<H2>Who's best at privatization? </H2>
<H4><I>Euromoney's</I> poll of government finance ministries, privatized
companies, investors and banks puts Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan
Stanley at the top of the privatization rankings. Their European rivals
are on the whole less popular, but not as unpopular as, say, the words &quot;French
privatization&quot; are to the average investor. By Charles Piggott and
Sasha Zbitnoff </H4>
Goldman Sachs has long been acknowledged as an expert in privatization but
<I>Euromoney</I>'s poll shows just how far ahead of the pack Goldman is:
overall, Goldman Sachs ranks 49 points ahead of its closest competitor -
more than most banks scored in total. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Euromoney</I>'s ranking of the top 20 privatization banks is based on
aggregate scores given by governments, privatized companies, investors and
the banks' peers. <I>Euromoney</I> asked government ministry officials involved
in privatization programmes, company directors of privatized companies,
and heads of equity capital markets: <I>&quot;Overall, which banks or investment
banks are the best global co-ordinators of privatization issues?&quot;</I>
Institutional investors were asked: <I>&quot;Overall, which banks or investment
banks do you most like to buy privatization shares from?&quot;</I> Scores
from these questions were added together to produce the top 20 banks overall.
<BR>
<BR>
The three tables which follow the overall top 20 show how each group voted.
Bankers consistently named the same half-dozen banks as best at privatization,
while government officials, company directors and, to a lesser extent, investors
were more wide-ranging in their answers. Whereas the banks themselves nominated
only 10 banks among the overall best global co-ordinators, governments and
companies named 29 different banks. <BR>
<BR>
The triumvirate of Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley appears
consistently at or near the top throughout the survey. Goldman Sachs is
considered to be the best company adviser, the second best government adviser,
the best at telecom privatizations and the best organizer of roadshows.
Goldman also wins the top spot for innovation. <BR>
<BR>
Merrill Lynch, which ranks second in the overall top 20, is considered the
top broker of Latin American privatization shares and second best broker
of Asian privatization shares. The company also ranks top for placing shares
with retail investors, second for co-ordinating telecom and steel privatizations,
and second for organizing roadshows. <BR>
<BR>
Morgan Stanley, which ranks fourth overall, appears in almost all the categories
and is considered by investors to be the top broker of western European
privatization shares. The company is also ranked top in both capital and
consumer goods privatizations and equal second best company adviser. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Road show surprise</B> <BR>
<BR>
The poll places most European banks, with the exception of SBC Warburg and
NM Rothschild, in the second tier. CS First Boston is ranked fifth, ABN
Amro sixth, Dresdner-Kleinwort Benson seventh, Barclays de Zoete Wedd eighth,
Union Bank of Switzerland ninth and NM Rothschild 10th. <BR>
<BR>
Although SBC Warburg ranks third overall, investors voted the firm their
favourite privatization broker. SBC Warburg also ranks as the top lead-manager
for European tranches and best at land transport, steel and utility sectors.
<BR>
<BR>
NM Rothschild and Goldman Sachs dominate in advisory roles. Rothschild leads
the government advisers' league table, but strangely failed to score when
<I>Euromoney </I>asked governments themselves to name their most trusted
advisers. Goldman emerges as the top company adviser. <BR>
<BR>
Even though some respondents claimed there was little or no difference in
the service the banks provided, others expressed opinions on categories
that were not covered by the poll. For example, even though there was no
category for the best public relations firm, Imagination scored 27 points
for the best organizer of roadshows. And although <I>Euromoney</I> did not
ask which country's privatization programme had been the worst, no fewer
than six investors nominated the French privatization programme as the most
disastrous. Italy's privatization programme also came under attack. <BR>
<BR>
Banks also received their share of negative votes. Some respondents voted
for Banque Nationale de Paris, ranked 14 overall, and Banque Paribas, ranked
equal 16, as the worst privatization banks (even though <I>Euromoney</I>
did not ask respondents to score banks in this category). No points were
deducted from the banks' scores for this. <BR>
<BR>
Although most investors stressed they were more concerned with the quality
of stock than the broker which sold it to them, few agreed on which privatization
stocks they did like. The only programme to win anything like widespread
enthusiasm was the UK's, where the accolades go to electricity companies,
ports and other utilities. Even though some of the nominations in this category
overlap (eg both UK water and utility companies appear separately in the
results), the scores have been left to reflect investors' views as given.
<BR>
<BR>
The poll also shows that foreign banks have yet to make an impact on Japanese
investors: votes for the best lead-manager of Japanese tranches went instead
to Japan's big three securities houses - Nomura, Daiwa and Nikko. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Methodology </H2>
<I>Euromoney</I> polled government officials involved in privatization;
directors and finance officers at companies which were recently privatized;
institutional investors; and heads of equity capital markets at leading
banks. The poll was conducted by telephone and fax between December 8 1995
and January 12 1996. In total, <I>Euromoney</I> received 117 replies which
break down as follows: banks (37), investors (45), governments (14), and
privatized companies (21). Although <I>Euromoney</I> received replies from
Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe, the majority of replies came from
western Europe. <I>Euromoney</I> targeted governments with the largest privatization
programmes: eight OECD governments replied, four of them G10 countries.
Many of the governments <I>Euromoney</I> spoke to were unwilling to rate
their banks and, for this reason, <I>Euromoney</I> also polled the privatized
companies. Although issuers' experience of banks in the field of privatization
is likely to be limited to their own privatization, company directors were
able to withhold their vote from banks which had not performed well during
their privatization. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Weightings:<B> </B></I>All respondents were asked to name the top three
banks in each category. Scores were given on the basis of three points for
first place, two points for second place and one point for third place.

<H3>BUSINESS TRAVEL POLL</H3>
<H2>
<B>The world's favourite airline, hotel, airport...</B>
</H2>
<P>
The senior executives who read <I>Euromoney</I> are a loyal and conservative group. This magazine's annual business travel poll shows a strong consistency in the executives' decisions on how to travel when they are away on business. For the fourth year running, Hong Kong's Mandarin Oriental has been voted the best hotel. And once again British Airways is miles ahead of the competition for first, business and economy class travel, according to respondents.

<P>
<I>Euromoney</I> asked PAs, secretaries and in-house travel agents to name the hotels, hotel chains, airlines, airports and conference venues their senior executives like best in each of the countries they visit regularly.

<P>
Three points were awarded to the first choice, two the second favourite and one for the third choice.

<H2>REAL GROWTH  REAL VALUE </H2>
<H4>Thomas Doorley outlines the diagnostic tools which can help launch
and sustain growth </H4>
The history of the Industrial Revolution has been written by very large
companies. In Europe it has encompassed the chemical behemoths of Germany
and the pharmaceutical giants of Switzerland. In North America, the title
<I>Fortune</I> 500 was a singular honour. At their peak, annual sales revenues
among this group of companies represented 60% of US GDP. <BR>
<BR>
But the role of the mega-company is changing as a new force rises to prominence.
Today economic growth often results from a successful coming-of-age of smaller
companies and indeed in the developed economies, average size is becoming
ever-smaller. For example, measured by the number of employees, the average
company is now 20% below its peak level in the US and Germany and a whopping
65% smaller in Britain, a continuing trend in all three countries. As a
result, by 1994 the <I>Fortune</I> 500 represented just 35% of US GDP. <BR>
<BR>
This shift is emphasised still more spectacularly by data on job creation,
a central requirement for a healthy economy, where the recent record of
large companies is tragically poor. In 1994, <I>Fortune</I> 500 companies
employed 11.6 million people. In 1965, <I>Fortune </I>500 companies employed
virtually the same number of people: a record of zero jobs created over
three decades. <BR>
<BR>
In dramatic contrast, our research has identified an encouraging countertrend:
in North America only 200 companies - true growth champions - account for
11% of all jobs created in the past decade. All are less than 25 years old.
While some are very large, like WalMart ($82 billion in revenues) or Microsoft
($4.5 billion), many are expanding medium-sized companies, such as Rodale
Press and Sealed Air ($500 million) or Loctite and Canadian Occidental ($700
million). Our economies are regenerating themselves through the vitality
of these young organisations. <BR>
<BR>
But entrepreneurs face a daunting task if they are to survive, let alone
reach sufficient scale to make a noticeable impact. Conventional wisdom
has it that 80% of new businesses fail in their first five years. Furthermore,
small companies are unstable. The average rate of sales growth per new employee
is negative for firms with fewer than 1,000 on the payroll, a figure which
becomes a crude measure of critical mass. To double the odds of survival
such firms need to focus on high employment growth, driven by high sales
growth. <BR>
<BR>
For smaller companies the challenge is considerable. However, there are
a set of lessons, employed by the growth champions, that can inform the
behaviour of every company whatever its size. These lessons are drawn from
Braxton Associates' continuing research into growth and can help to guide
organisations intent on expansion. <BR>
<BR>
It is essential to reach critical mass and continue growing: the key question
is how to do it. To answer this question for mid-sized companies and enable
their large counterparts to capture the benefits as well, we have embarked
upon a two-year research effort focused on how companies grow, with leading
academics helping to guide and focus the work. The project began in North
America and now encompasses over 1,200 companies both there and in Europe,
with the Asia/Pacific region set to provide the next focus. <BR>
<BR>
The result is a fresh and powerful set of insights synthesised into what
we call the Growth System. We discovered that the most successful companies
did not abide by a single set of rules. Rather, growth can be seen as a
system with three principal elements. First, it requires a commitment to
growth as an overriding goal. Second, firms need to execute actions across
the three phases of growth: to create a valuable formula, exploit the formula
and manage the transition to the next phase of formula creation. Third,
successful companies build foundations of leadership, organisational architecture,
culture, processes and knowledge to sustain growth over time. Each element
becomes embedded in the fabric of the most successful. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Commitment </B><BR>
<BR>
We divided a sample of 250 Canadian companies into five revenue growth quintiles.
Over five years the top 50 firms - those with share growth of more than
15% per year - created over C$10 billion ($7.3 billion) of value for their
shareholders; in stark contrast, the slowest 50 (share growth less than
5% per year) destroyed nearly C$1 billion of value. As a broad rule of thumb,
a company growing at double-digit rates creates five times as much value
for its shareholders as a stagnant company. <BR>
<BR>
The value-creation potential of growth is recognised by all economies. A
look at the performance of <I>World Link</I>'s Global Growth Companies underscores
this fundamental relationship. Companies that have achieved strong rates
of expansion are the same companies that have experienced tremendous growth
in market value for their shareholders. If the increase in shareholder value
is not a sufficient spur to growth, then perhaps the inverse can work: the
fear of going out of business through low growth rates. Such a worry would
be realistic: among US firms declaring bankruptcy in the '90s, the average
had been shrinking at nearly 5% per year, compared to an average annual
growth rate of 8% for survivors. If a company does not grow, it is unlikely
to survive. <BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, growth companies tend to buzz with enthusiasm. In surveys,
employee satisfaction is sharply higher in growth companies even when employees
work longer hours on heavier workloads. <BR>
<BR>
In short, a first principle of growth is that to achieve it you must believe
in it. In almost every expanding company, people talk about the value of
growth and its siblings innovation and customer satisfaction: almost half
of them do so explicitly in formal vision or mission statements compared
to just 15% of less successful firms. If a company and its leaders do not
buy into the growth argument, they do not sustain key actions or provide
sufficient investment in the underlying foundations. And if this happens,
they do not grow. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Actions </B><BR>
<BR>
Company leaders aspiring to high levels of value-creating expansion seek
to appeal to new customers, to preempt similar spurts by competitors and
find a novel use for existing skills. We discovered that three key abilities
distinguish winners from losers: to create something useful, to exploit
innovation and to survive radical change. These skills define the three
growth phases. <BR>
<BR>
Creating a valuable formula means more than just meeting customer needs
with a superior product. It also involves delivering the superior offering
to the market. McDonalds' success worldwide as a fast food provider is due
as much to the combination of its clean stores, convenient locations and
well-trained staff as to its high quality and competitively priced burgers
and fries. <BR>
<BR>
Exploiting the formula effectively demands a different but complementary
set of skills. While the creative phase may be the domain of a relatively
few clever folks, the exploitation phase requires virtually the entire organisation
to operate in concert, in order to glean as much reward from the formula
as fast as possible. <BR>
<BR>
Here is where shareholder value is released and jobs created. The mindset
differs radically. Creators are intuitive and have a single-minded focus
on their customers. Exploiters are efficient, aggressive and near-predatory
in their need to beat the competition. If creators are dreamers, exploiters
are warriors. <BR>
<BR>
Disney exploits its formula of family-oriented entertainment. WalMart, a
peerless soft goods retailer, is a similarly effective exploiter of its
low-cost, high-service formula. Both companies achieve high market shares
- Disney is 10 times the size of its nearest competitor, WalMart is triple
the size of its own - and create enormous value for their shareholders.
Over the last 10 years, Disney has increased its market value by close to
1100% while WalMart has risen over 800%. <BR>
<BR>
Managing the transition implies a visionary perspective. No matter how good
you are, how valuable your formula or how effectively you exploit it, the
formula will come to an end. Technologies get leap-frogged, customers' needs
change, public policy shifts intrude. Winners understand and prepare for
this. <BR>
<BR>
Andrew Grove, Intel's CEO, acknowledges the transition by saying: &quot;There
is at least one point in the history of any company when you have to change
dramatically... Miss the moment and you start to decline.&quot; John Young,
retired CEO of Hewlett-Packard, emphasises the importance of managing transitions
with his dictum that 60% of HP's revenue must come from products introduced
in the previous two years. The goal of &quot;60-in-2&quot; forces HP to
cannibalise its own products before competitors and pour cash into research
and development. <BR>
<BR>
Winners share a keen sensitivity to all three phases and understand how
their various products, businesses and corporations are positioned. Interestingly,
most companies are not equally adept at each phase. For example, Corning,
a consummate creator, forms downstream strategic alliances (as with Germany's
Siemens in optical fibre or Japan's Samsung in cathode ray tubes for video
displays) to exploit fully the value of its formulas. <BR>
<BR>
Growing is one thing, sustaining that growth over the long term is another
challenge altogether. Our research suggests a troublesome pattern; namely,
that while many companies achieve an early rush of growth, most soon decline.
Once they decline, few rebound. The pattern is as follows: in an analysis
of nearly 1,500 companies among the top third for growth in 1975-81, 292
or 60% slipped to the middle third in the period 1982-88 and only 35% of
those made it back to the top third in 1989-94. So nearly 80% of the original
strong growers faded over two decades. <BR>
<BR>
What is often ignored in the early, heady days of success is a determined
focus on building the five growth-supporting foundations. Thus, when change
arrives, when that first hot product gets trumped, the organisation struggles,
fades and often disappears. If a young, medium-sized company aspires to
maintain its momentum and become one of the winners, it must find the time
and energy to work on building its foundations for the long term. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Foundations </B><BR>
<BR>
* Leadership refers not just to today's leaders, but to developing programmes
which create tomorrow's leaders. This requires a company-wide vision which
incorporates the central role of growth and which is communicated and embraced
within the organisation. <BR>
<BR>
* Architecture means ensuring the company knows what it does best and knows
how to leverage that across its own organisation and its different customers.
To avoid distraction, non-core activities are outsourced - frequently via
enduring strategic alliances both forward and backward within the value
chain. <BR>
<BR>
* Culture means recognising that high-growth cultures differ sharply from
low-growth ones. Key attributes for double-digit growth include customer
focus, team orientation, and accountability. <BR>
<BR>
* Processes mean both management tools such as performance measurement and
business processes such as product development and customer service. All
processes must be aligned to support growth. So reward systems must support
a high-growth culture by identifying and rewarding high performers. <BR>
<BR>
* Knowledge requires a rapid flow of information within the organisation.
Good ideas need to circulate fast. Growth companies embed knowledge into
products or services and share it with customers. <BR>
<BR>
Our work so far clearly demonstrates the important role played by growth.
After all, most people are likely to want to be a part of an organisation
which shares benefits like value creation for shareholders, inspiration
for employees and job creation for the national economy. Both those wanting
to expand and those already succeeding can adopt a three-step process (figure
1). Taking the principles of the Growth System, this means assessing your
own organisation's commitment to growth, its growth-capturing actions and
the alignment of the foundations which support it. <BR>
<BR>
Phase I, the Growth Diagnostic, is similar to a periodic examination by
your physician. The doctor recommends this as an important measure to uncover
potential health problems while still treatable, and to correct poor health
habits. A Growth Diagnostic, conducted periodically, represents a corporate
assessment to determine the health of strategies, actions and underlying
business foundations. Properly conducted, this can help ensure a long, productive
corporate life. <BR>
<BR>
<B>After the diagnosis </B><BR>
<BR>
Phases II and III extend the findings of the Diagnosis into a continuing
programme of healthy behaviour. The periodic checkup is as important in
corporate life as it is in our personal lives. Bad habits and play-it-safe
attitudes creep insidiously into firms that have established a record of
growth and innovation. The engine, once stalled, can be painful and slow
to restart. <BR>
<BR>
There are companies that do expand consistently by adapting their own version
of the Growth System. One such is Rodale Press, the world's largest health
and fitness publisher. They have created a series of valuable formulas around
their greatest strengths, the gathering and synthesising of copious amounts
of health and fitness information into usable, everyday advice. Equally
impressive is Rodale's commitment to its foundations. The Rodale culture
is as much a way of life as it is a corporate culture. The late Bob Rodale
described the importance of foundations by drawing a tree depicting both
the roots underground and the foliage above ground. Without deep roots,
no plant can survive winds and droughts over the years. <BR>
<BR>
Ireland's Elan is one of the world's fastest growing drug companies (four
years of 100% growth) and with $250 million in sales is now coming of age,
a mid-sized growth champion. Foundations are a key success factor. <BR>
<BR>
The company is leadership-driven, with a vision &quot;to develop patient-friendly,
cost-effective drug delivery systems that deliver drugs as they are needed,
rather than overloading the body with poorly performing substances with
potential side effects&quot;. This vision is so well understood that it
becomes Elan's valuable formula. Its culture is deeply embedded, strong
and growth-focused. <BR>
<BR>
If you find yourself stuck in a low-growth period, here is one useful idea
that often works. Rank potential growth actions in terms of their ability
to produce results early, even if they are not likely to have the largest
long-term payoff. An organisation that has not grown for a while forgets
how to grow. It only knows how to shrink. A quick burst of growth rebuilds
confidence and unleashes energy. Once it works, celebrate the success, noisily
and widely. Over-reward the team. This will make future growth in the bigger,
higher-value arenas much easier. <BR>
<BR>
Achieving sustainable growth is the key challenge facing business leaders
today. It is hard: customers are more demanding; competitors are more aggressive;
technology is changing, all at a faster pace than ever. Survival is at stake.
Growth is the driver.<HR><BR>

<H3>GROWTH TABLE MANNERS </H3>
<H4>World Link presents the world's fastest profit growth firms and offers
seven case studies which pinpoint ingredients of success</H4>
<BR>
In today's hypercompetitive market companies must either grow or wither.
Although all successful companies expand, only a handful can sustain remarkable
rates of growth. <I>World Link</I>, with the support of international consultants
and auditors Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International, sets out to discover
the world's fastest growing companies. The research is an outgrowth of the
three years it has spent identifying Europe's Hidden Champions, a group
of medium-sized fast-growing companies. <BR>
<BR>
To find the 200 fastest-growing companies in the world, <I>World Link</I>
used the OneSource international equities database of over 11,000 publicly
listed corporations. We chose five-year compound growth in earnings per
share (EPS) as the best indicator of true growth: revenue and profit figures
are distorted by acquisitions or disposals, while market value is highly
dependent on the fortunes of each individual market. To ensure the figures
were a fair reflection of growth, we normalised the base year figures by
taking an average of the EPS six, five and four years before the current
year (which eliminates a single extraordinary year skewing the result).
All other growth rates in the table have been normalised in the same way.
<BR>
<BR>
What can be gleaned from the table? First, sustained fast growth is rare.
Only 200 companies out of over 11,000 post a consistent EPS growth of over
30%. But a five-year record of over 30% growth means nearly quadrupling
EPS in that period. In the US market, which has the highest number of fast-growth
companies, the market average is 2.4%. Even in the US electronics industry,
average growth is only 3.8%. <BR>
<BR>
Most of the 200 are mid-sized corporations. There are a few giants that
sustain growth - Samsung and Chrysler make the 200 - but 139 of the group
have revenues under $1 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Unsurprisingly many of the 200 are in industries that have spurted ahead
in the last five years such as electronics, pharmaceuticals and media. Others
are flattered by having recovered from a period of distress in the late
'80s and early '90s (notably some financial services companies). Most, however,
demonstrate the characteristics of sustained growth detailed in Thomas Doorley's
analysis of the keys to corporate growth (see previous article). <BR>
<BR>
To get some idea why companies have done so well, <I>World Link</I> looked
in detail at seven of the 200, trying to reflect the range of industries
and countries in the table. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Rogers: a thoroughly modern firm </B><BR>
<BR>
Perched on top of our fastest profit growth firms is Rogers Corporation,
a 1,000-plus employee firm based in the town of the same name in the US
state of Connecticut. <BR>
<BR>
This very modern firm now manufactures speciality polymer materials and
electronic products, although Rogers started life in 1832 and was incorporated
in 1901 as a paper-maker. <BR>
<BR>
In 1992 the company began its dramatic turnaround through a strategic restructuring.
Harry Birkenruth, president and CEO, says: &quot;Rogers changed its basic
strategy and began to concentrate on speciality polymer composite materials
for growth markets. Recent strong growth has come from applications in wireless
communications and from computer and peripheral equipment and from sales
outside the US which now amount to 40% of the total.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It is now beginning to attract the attention of analysts drawn by the eye-catching
EPS figures. In 1994, EPS rose 36% on sales up 9% and in the first nine
months of last year the figure was up 22% on a 5% sales increase. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Amgen: hard work and intense camaraderie </B><BR>
<BR>
Founded in 1980, Amgen is the world's largest independent biotech company.
Its success comes almost entirely from sales of two drugs: Neupogen and
Epogen. The former helps chemotherapy patients avoid infection, the latter
treats anaemia in kidney dialysis patients. <BR>
<BR>
Between 1990 and 1992, when these drugs had just received approval for US
sale, the company's earnings and share price rose tenfold. <BR>
<BR>
The company, based in California, highlights &quot;hard work, long hours
and intense camaraderie&quot; in its product development teams as success
factors. And much of its manufacturing takes place in Puerto Rico to save
costs. <BR>
<BR>
Sales of Neupogen have grown for the last five years and by 1993 it was
the world's best-selling cancer drug. Amgen became the first biotech firm
to make $1 billion in revenue. <BR>
<BR>
But potential has occasionally handicapped the company, as expectations
become hard to match. Its share price suffered sharp drops in February 1993
and 1994, when sales of Neupogen were slower than predicted. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Newbridge: providers for the next generation </B><BR>
<BR>
Newbridge Networks Corporation, seventh in our survey, is a Canadian-based
firm designing and manufacturing a family of network products for a range
of customers including many of the world's largest telecomms providers.
<BR>
<BR>
That is the formal description. According to the Toronto <I>Globe and Mail</I>,
&quot;the Ontario-based telecoms company seems to be metamorphosing from
a... telephone switchmaker into a provider of next-generation Internet-type
gizmos, and the market likes it&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The firm's work in newer technologies places it among the fashionable Net-related
stocks which have performed so well in the past 12 months. Not that the
company has had a happy history with the markets: in August 1994 trading
problems and a poor quarter led to $1 billion being wiped off its market
value. <BR>
<BR>
Newbridge has been the Cinderella of its sector. While US firms have traded
at 50 times the following year's estimated earnings, the Canadian firm has
traded as low as 16 times estimated earnings, largely because investors
continue to question future profitability. <BR>
<BR>
This seems harsh given the firm's 119% EPS increase over the past five years.
Continuing share price instability is predicted as the firm brings new products
to market, just as sales of older products fall off. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Kolb &amp; Sch&uuml;le: market niches mean fast growth </B><BR>
<BR>
Kolb &amp; Sch&uuml;le AG, which celebrates its centenary next year, is
a holding company for nine industrial and real estate investments. The company's
main activities are in the textile and clothing sector although it has a
profitable property arm too. As a particularly asset-rich company ($92.7
million in 1994) it moved into real estate activities to develop property
which was owned, but not needed, by the company. <BR>
<BR>
What is surprising is that despite being based in traditionally high-cost
Germany, its clever selection of market niches has enabled compound growth
over five years of 91% and revenues in 1994 of $6.8 million. <BR>
<BR>
It currently has a leading position in Europe as manufacturers of fibre
and down-proof fabrics. One particularly profitable niche has been domestic
linen. A series of acquisitions over the last few years have secured its
hold on the German clothing market. In April it took over a Munich-based
national costume and jeans manufacturer and in 1992-93 bought half of Becon
Classic GMBH, the former leading east German men's brand. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Bavaria: at the other end of the social scale </B><BR>
<BR>
Bavaria, the world's fifth largest beer brewer, is the cornerstone of billionaire
Julio Mario Santo Domingo III's empire, which stretches right across Colombian
industry. <BR>
<BR>
Over the last five years Bavaria has grown by acquisition. Already dominant
in Colombia and Ecuador, the firm bought Portuguese firm Centralcer in 1991,
which gave it a springboard for imports into Spain. Adding to this, the
group bought 70% of Spanish brewer Cerveceria Aguila in 1992. Growth of
the Colombian economy has also boosted the market value of Bavaria, which
is 60% publicly owned. <BR>
<BR>
Santo Domingo takes no nonsense from his staff. Many went on strike in 1991,
demanding uniform agreements in all the firm's plants. Having defeated the
45-day strike, he restructured the group to make sure there could be no
further collective action. <BR>
<BR>
A real threat is on the horizon, however. Rival firm Ardila Lulle purchased
a large brewery in 1992, with a capacity of up to a fifth of the country's
beer production. The soft drinks firm owns a distribution network which
leaves Bavaria's sub-contracted lorries standing. And thousands of small
retailers use free fridges, supplied by Ardila, to cool drinks. Ardila is
now threatening to remove any fridge found with Bavaria bottles in it. <BR>
<BR>
Bavaria has responded by buying a soft-drinks firm and by experimenting
with alcoholic colas. The aristocratic Santo Domingo is dismissive of Ardila's
chairman: &quot;We are at the opposite end of the social scheme.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Samsung: not interfering with senior managers </B><BR>
<BR>
Like Korea's other <I>chaebols</I>, Samsung Electronics relied heavily on
reverse engineering in its early years, but the company has since nurtured
its own research arm with exceptional success. <BR>
<BR>
Samsung is at the cutting edge in expanding fields. By adding its own research
to technology bought from Texas Instruments and Toshiba, it is the world's
leading producer of semiconductors. It is particularly strong in d-rams
or dynamic random access memory chips. <BR>
<BR>
Samsung chairman Lee Kun Hee encourages individuality in his staff. He leaves
senior managers to work with little interference. The firm also sends hundreds
of young employees overseas in the hope of stimulating initiative. <BR>
<BR>
Samsung chose the right area to invest in memory chips. The firm has benefited
from huge world demand, which drove prices up in the early '90s. From 1993
to 94, Samsung saw a 70% rise in sales. The firm aims to join the top five
electronics manufacturers by 2000. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Cultor: a global and cooperative outlook </B><BR>
<BR>
Finnish nutrition company Cultor's rapid growth and profitability has been
a result of its global and cooperative outlook. Over half of its $1.5 billion
revenues in 1994 were generated outside Finland and the company has now
developed a sweet tooth for international partnerships and alliances. Currently
40% of equity is held by foreign owners. <BR>
<BR>
Founded in 1918, the company spent the next 70 years diversifying into every
sector conceivable, but by the end of the '80s it had become clear that
the companby needed to strip down to its core business to survive. <BR>
<BR>
Consequently chairman and CEO Bj&ouml;rn Mattsson rationalised and focused
on two r&amp;d-intense areas: animal nutrition, where it controls half the
world's market share and sweeteners, where it has the market leader Xylitol.
The firm also has an interest in baking and a 50:50 partnership with US
chemical giant Eastman Chemicals in an enzyme research unit called Genencor.
<BR>
<BR>
In December Cultor became one of the world's largest food ingredient companies
in the world after buying Pfizer's food science activities for $352.5 million.
This will broaden its international network by adding an additional six
production sites to the current 12. Perhaps more importantly, however, the
move will strengthen the company in the US. <BR>

<H3>WORLD COMPETITIVENESS <BR>
<BR>
WINNERS AND LOSERS? </H3>
<H4><I>For the first time World Link presents a detailed summary by Paul
Martin of the annual World Competitiveness Report, together with a fresh
round of debate between leading economic protagonists Paul Krugman and Jeffrey
Sachs</I> </H4>
The United States is again the world's most competitive nation, while Japan's
economic woes have pushed it further down the rankings, according to the
<I>World Competitiveness Report</I> (WCR), published by the World Economic
Forum and the Swiss management school IMD. <BR>
<BR>
The US regained its place at the head of the WCR last year, after almost
a decade of Japa-nese dominance. This year, Tokyo's continuing economic
and political difficulties have combined with the US economic recovery to
increase the gap. Singapore stayed in second place, Hong Kong moved up one
to third and Japan fell one place to fourth. <BR>
<BR>
These findings provide the headlines for the 15th <I>World Competitiveness
Report</I> which measures international competitiveness, defined as &quot;the
ability of a country or a company to, proportionally, generate more wealth
than its competitors in world markets&quot;. The report also presents a
statistical review of changes in the world economy over the past year, ranking
the economies of 48 countries and territories (Belgium and Luxembourg are
counted together), seven more than last year. In addition to China and Russia,
which were included last year but not ranked, the new faces in this year's
report are Egypt, Iceland, Israel, Jordan and Peru. <BR>
<BR>
On top of statistics, the WCR includes several contributions to the debate
on the appropriate definitions, measurement and indeed the relevance of
international competitiveness. We make our own contribution to the debate
on page 46, with comments by professors Paul Krugman of Stanford University
and Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University. <BR>
<BR>
The report ranks each economy under eight headings, known as &quot;factors
of competitiveness&quot;. These are: <BR>
<BR>
* Domestic Economic Strength: the overall evaluation at a macroeconomic
level. Criteria include GDP growth, the effect of the parallel economy,
capital formation and agricultural productivity. <BR>
<BR>
* Internationalisation: the extent to which a country participates in international
trade and investment flows. This also includes the effect of protectionism,
immigration policies, and the country's international influence. <BR>
<BR>
* Government: the extent to which government policies are conducive to competitiveness.
As well as fiscal and monetary policy, this also includes environmental
and labour laws, corruption, the fairness of the judicial system and the
responsiveness of the political system. <BR>
<BR>
* Finance: performance of capital markets and the quality of financial services,
including the size and nature of the banking sector, central bank policies,
and access to international and domestic capital markets. <BR>
<BR>
* Infrastructure: examining whether the resources and systems are adequate
for business needs. Includes availability and use of natural resources and
the state of the environment. <BR>
<BR>
* Management: the extent to which enterprises are managed in an innovative,
profitable and responsible manner. Other aspects include labour productivity,
management remuneration and staff turnover. <BR>
<BR>
* Science and Technology: an assessment of scientific and technological
capacity, together with the success of basic and applied research. For example,
countries are ranked on Nobel Prizes awarded in physics, chemistry, physiology
or medicine and economics since 1950. <BR>
<BR>
* People: availability and qualifications, including criteria such as quality
of life, income distribution and whether national values support competitiveness.
<BR>
<BR>
Unsurprisingly, the most competitive economies perform well across a range
of categories. The US ranks first in four criteria and second in two others,
while Singapore is first in three and second in two more. Russia ranks last
in every factor of competitiveness except People, where it is 46 out of
48. <BR>
<BR>
Quantitative data for the WCR are supplied through a global network of partner
institutions. Countries are ranked on criteria ranging from GNP per capita
and balance of trade to secondary school enrolment. The Executive Opinion
Survey [below], which counts for one-third of the report's data, is a 130-item
questionnaire sent to 21,000 executives in top and middle management. Each
country is ranked separately on every criterion, resulting in nearly 800
pages of detailed information on every aspect of national competitiveness.
<BR>
<BR>
The US ranks first in Domestic Economic Strength, Internationalisation,
Management, and Science and Technology. However, lower rankings in Government
(sixth) and People (ninth) point to the sort of disaffection and disenchantment
seen in recent elections there. Problems there highlighted in the report
include concern among executives about the impact of Aids on the economy,
violent crime, alcohol and drug abuse as well as more general doubts about
the ability of the educational or political systems to adapt to new economic
realities. All are probably crucial to ensuring both continuing competitive
advantage and the country's social cohesion in the face of rapid economic
and technological change. Stephane Garelli, professor at IMD and the University
of Lausanne and director of the World Competitiveness Project, feels that
the resolution of such tensions is the central challenge in creating a &quot;competitive
society&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Singapore has often proclaimed its desire to be measured against the OECD
economies and in the WCR this desire is vindicated. Singapore is the only
country that comes close to challenging the US. It ranks first in Government,
Finance and People, and second in Domestic Economic Strength and Internationalisation.
It is also first in the Executive Opinion Survey. All of this seems to support
many people's claim that Singapore can serve as a model for other developing
countries, although familiar bottlenecks remain such as a reliance on imported
energy supplies. The island's success has unearthed new structural constraints,
such as the difficulty of finding and retaining skilled labour. How the
government deals with the rising social demands of its middle class and
mounting competition from several east Asian neighbours, notably Malaysia,
will be a serious test in the coming years. <BR>
<BR>
Singapore's great rival Hong Kong advances one place this year at the expense
of Japan. Pro-business government policies and the colony's important role
in world trade, particularly with China, more than outweigh its limitations
in categories like Infrastructure, Research and Development and People.
In this latter factor, low rankings in quality of life criteria such as
education, health, access to property and population density are compensated
by workers' support for capitalist attitudes and values like competitiveness.
Hong Kong's third-place ranking in the executive survey might suggest businesspeople
are not worried about the 1997 handover to China, although the &quot;brain
drain&quot; shows no sign of stopping. <BR>
<BR>
The authors of the WCR have often claimed that one of the main uses of the
report, especially the executive survey, is to identify imminent changes
in the competitiveness of eco- nomies before they show up in macroeconomic
data. This is well illustrated by Japan's continuing slide through the rankings.
In 1993, Japan was the most competitive nation in the world, according to
the report. But even then danger signs were showing in waning confidence
among executives and in the Government factor. This foreshadowed Japan's
fall to third place last year and fourth this year. The recession is obviously
behind the fall to fourth place in Domestic Economic Strength and to sixth
in Finance. But, as the report highlights, Japan's real competitiveness
problems are social and political; in 1991 Japan's Government rating was
second, now it is 27. Japan has even lost its previously unassailable lead
in People (now sixth) and Management (fourth) with quality of life issues
and changing attitudes to work, especially among the young, having a particular
impact. <BR>
<BR>
The volatility of international capital flows and investor sentiment have
undoubtedly contributed to the falling rankings of the year's biggest movers,
Turkey and Mexico. Dramatic falls in the Finance, Management and Internationalisation
factors as well as in business confidence are the major reasons behind Turkey's
fall from 29 last year to 40 this year. Continuing social and political
unrest and inflation are among the concerns highlighted. <BR>
<BR>
However, it is Mexico that has suffered the most complete reversal of fortunes
over the past year. Last year's WCR did not predict it any better than those
fund managers whose precipitous flight from all things Mexican this year
so exacerbated the crisis. The government of President Carlos Salinas, who
wrote the foreword to last year's report, was ranked tenth last year. After
the Chiapas uprising, political assassinations, corruption allegations and
the badly handled devaluation of the peso, the country has plummeted in
the rankings. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mexico improvement since the survey </B><BR>
<BR>
Of course, this year's report probably measured conditions at the height
of domestic and international reaction to the peso crisis: replies to the
executive survey were completed by the end of April. At the time of writing,
it appeared that stability was beginning to return to the Mexican economy.
With the successful placement of international debt issues by sovereign
and corporate entities, Mexico is unlikely to draw down all of the standby
facility provided by the US and the IMF. <BR>
<BR>
The authors have made every effort to ensure that the figures are reliable
and comparable but there are bound to be anomalies in such a diverse and
detailed collection, caused either by different systems of measurement and
reporting standards or because of the cultural bias inherent in the qualitative
questions. For example, Finnish bankers probably need to work on their public
relations as they were ranked lower than their Russian counterparts in the
executive survey. At the same time, the performance of the country's financial
markets and the quality of its financial services have improved Finland's
position to just above France in the middle of the table. <BR>
<BR>
There are many who argue that the whole focus on international competitiveness
is misplaced and potentially counterproductive. Indeed, in one example Garelli
concedes that 90% of what America consumes is made in the US, making absolute
domestic productivity growth a more appropriate measure of improved welfare
than relative competitiveness. However, countries like Singapore or the
Netherlands who depend on international activity for the majority of their
GDP cannot afford to ignore the exercise. Garelli argues that within each
country there are in fact two types of economy: an economy of proximity,
which provides products and services close to the end-user and an economy
of globality, which is characterised by worldwide management of the value
chain. The current concern about competitiveness stems largely from the
transfer of activities from one type of economy to the other, usually from
proximity to globality, with the resultant confusion about which businesses
or jobs belong to which type of economy, who controls them and who benefits
from them. <BR>
<BR>
Briefly, the economy of proximity is characterised by a low degree of physical
mobility, protection from foreign investors and interference with the market
mechanism. Examples include traditional jobs such as plumbing, new jobs
such as customised software design and those with social added value such
as health or education. In contrast, the economy of globality is an &quot;economy
of maximum efficiency&quot;. The aim is to control the value chain, not
necessarily to own it, with structures that give priority to mobility and
resilience. <BR>
<BR>
Such a dichotomy may seem too simplistic but Garelli's point is that because
the two types of economy sometimes clash, a truly competitive society has
to find a dynamic equilibrium between wealth creation on one side and social
cohesion on the other. In other words, &quot;competitiveness is not just
efficiency&quot;. Indeed, citizens may wish to subsidise a certain level
of economic inefficiency by protecting an industry in the economy of proximity
in order to avoid some social cost such as unemployment. <BR>
<BR>
This debate is continued in the WCR in the section, <I>Competitiveness in
Perspective</I>. Werner Ketelh&ouml;hn, a professor at IMD, comes close
to advocating the selection of &quot;national champions&quot; by arguing
that countries compete to attract the most competitive global companies,
but that what may be a supporting environment for some industries &quot;could
be totally unattractive for other industries.&quot; Governments and businesses,
therefore, should try to develop &quot;hosting advantages&quot;. Choosing
the industries to support is the real trick. Ketelh&ouml;hn says that by
identifying &quot;key success factors&quot; in promising industries and
designing industrial policies to support them, countries can develop sustainable
advantages and secure long-term international competitiveness. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The activist argument </B><BR>
<BR>
The obvious danger in this strategy immediately suggests itself. In the
short term, for example, a country can create a so-called Low Delivered
Cost advantage by relaxing restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions, to
the long-term detriment of its environment and the health of its citizens.
But national governments under the pressure of regular elections work in
the short term and because the decision to support a particular industry
is political, the outcome will necessarily be political as well. Ketelh&ouml;hn
insists that &quot;protection of industrial competitiveness should not be
confused with plain subsidies, trade barriers and other temporary protectionist
measures.&quot; But without further explanation, it is difficult to see
how it could not be so. <BR>
<BR>
Arguing against such an activist industrial policy, Alberto Ades and Mark
Carney of Goldman Sachs and Rafael Di Tella of Oxford University claim that
&quot;the misplaced faith in national champions promotes policies which
are ultimately doomed to failure&quot;. They draw on WCR data and more detailed
analyses of national, industry and corporate performance to show that domestic
competition is strongly correlated with national competitiveness. Carney
has, furthermore, found that domestic competition is positively associated
with total factor productivity growth while foreign competition has an insignificant
impact. <BR>
<BR>
They conclude with a call for a re-examination of industrial policies. Recent
trade frictions between the US and Japan over auto parts, and the US and
Europe over entertainment have once again illustrated that &quot;the <I>simultaneous</I>
pursuit of activist policies can lead to large welfare losses for all parties
involved. This sad state of affairs is even more nonsensical if the policies
<I>in isolation</I> are ineffectual.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
What emerges from this debate is a sense that there are at least two distinct
definitions of national competitiveness. One emphasises the competition
to attract foreign investment (Ketelh&ouml;hn) and the other emphasises
the competitiveness of particular firms within each country (Ades <I>et
al</I>). One could argue, for example, that Wales is now successfully pursuing
policies designed to promote competitiveness of the first sort, while New
Zealand has followed policies designed to foster the second. <BR>
<BR>
What is clear is that the issue of international competitiveness remains
a central concern for both academics and, increasingly, politicians. While
the debate continues, the <I>World Competitiveness Report</I> will continue
to provide both valuable research and thought-provoking analysis. It will
also continue to provide a rich area for disagreement among the world's
divided community of economists <BR>

<H2> <B>Financial leaders for the 21st century</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>Want to know who
your boss will be in five years time? These are <I>Euromoney</I>'s picks for the
top 50 financial leaders aged 40 and under from around the world. They are
already in key positions in leading organizations around the world, and their
peers and mentors have marked them out for even greater things. Together, they
represent a broad church &#173; some coming from financial families but proving
their own worth, others making their way up from the bottom. We start with our
top 10; the rest are split up according to geographical region</B> </H4> 

<H2>
<B>Ana Patricia Bot&iacute;n </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Spain</I></B>

<P> Ana Patricia Bot&iacute;n is a member of Spain's most prominent banking
family, which has been at the helm of Banco Santander since its foundation 140
years ago. The 35-year-old chief executive of the group's investment banking arm,
Banco Santander de Negocios, and group executive deputy chairman, she was
educated in the US at Bryn Mawr College and Harvard.

<P> Bot&iacute;n's banking career began in 1981 at the credit management and
financial analysis department of JP Morgan in Madrid. She later worked at the US
bank's capital markets and treasury side in New York. In 1988 she returned to JP
Morgan in Madrid and the same year moved to the family bank where she set up the
investment banking and emerging markets division. In 1989 she was made a full
board member and a member of Banco Santander's executive committee.

<P> Banco Santander de Negocios contributed about 12% to total group profits of
about $100 million in 1995. Bot&iacute;n is the driving force behind Santander's
Latin American expansion in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela. She
was also instrumental in obtaining a New York broker-dealer licence for the bank.

<P> The mother of three children, Bot&iacute;n devotes much of her free time to
golf, being fortunate to have as tutor pro golfer Severiano Ballesteros, her
brother-in-law. She also finds time to play the piano and paint, and is a member
of the panel that will select the design for a millennium footbridge over the
Thames in London.

<P> Ana Patricia Bot&iacute;n is tipped to succeed her father, Emilio
Bot&iacute;n, as Banco Santander's chairman, which would make her the first woman
to run a major international bank. But she may have to wait a while &#173; her
grandfather Emilio was 84 when he retired as chairman.

<H2> <B>Colin Coleman </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>South Africa</I></B>

<P> <BR> Like many South Africans, Colin Coleman, head of the public finance
division of Standard Corporate and Merchant Bank (voted top merchant bank in
South Africa this year by <I>Euromoney</I>), had his future shaped by politics
rather than career choice. His family was highly politicized by the detention
without trial in the 1980s of his brothers Keith and Neil. Coleman studied at the
University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, where he became embroiled in
opposition to the apartheid regime.

<P> After graduating in 1988 he was recruited into and became a key player in the
Consultative Business Movement, a voluntary association and network of more than
a hundred South African corporations, which played a leading role in accelerating
South Africa's transition to democracy. During this time he played a major role
in constitution-making. He assisted in drafting the Memorandum of Understanding
for Peace and Reconciliation Agreement, which broke the deadlock a week before
the elections, bringing into the process Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom
Party.

<P> As Standard's director of public finance Coleman is now playing a significant
role in privatization and in arranging development finance, including leading the
establishment of the first private equity infrastructure fund in Africa, the $120
million South Africa Infrastructure Fund. The common thread in his activities has
been matching the needs of business and the disadvantaged to stimulate a healthy
economy. Coleman says his move to Standard Bank, initially working closely with
chairman Conrad Strauss, was not contradictory: "Banking for me provides the
means to help South Africa through the transition, from the political settlement
to the economic miracle." Coleman, who is the recipient of various international
awards, including the 1996 World Economic Forum's Global Leaders of Tomorrow, and
a co-author of two books on business and South Africa, has contacts in all camps
in South Africa. His colleagues consider he will reach the top in banking &#173;
if he does not move into politics.

<H2> <B>Peter Derby </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>US</I></B>

<P> "Seven years of crisis management." That is how Peter Derby describes life
since he came to Moscow in 1989 at the behest of Chicago commodities tycoon and
Russophile Joe Ritchie. Yet he has built a bank &#173; Dialog &#173; that
dominates corporate services for other expatriates brave enough to roam the Wild
East. He is hardly pining for the days when he toiled quietly in New York at
Chase and NatWest.

<P> Despite his surname and button-down aura, Derby has reason to feel at home in
Russia. His grandparents fled it after the Bolshevik revolution. He was raised in
the &eacute;migr&eacute; enclave of Sea Cliff, Long Island, hearing tales of the
lost, glorious motherland and speaking Russian at home.

<P> He promised Ritchie he'd stay a year. "I've been extending that every year
since," he says. "But now I don't see any curtailment of the extension." Why
should he? From three people and one desk, Dialog Bank has grown to 800 employees
&#173; who own 80% of it through a share option plan &#173; and $200 million in
assets. Clients include the Russian subsidiaries of Coca-Cola, Pizza Hut and
AT&amp;T, plus heavy-hitting Russian entities like the MosPromStroi construction
conglomerate. Dialog's seven retail branches have a lock on wire transfers, cash
advances, and other life-support systems for Moscow's 70,000 resident westerners.
Brokerage Troika Dialog controls some 20% of Russia's OTC equities trading and
was voted best Russian securities firm by <I>Euromoney</I>.

<P> Derby is now aware Russia is not the promised land. But he contends it is
possible to do business honestly there if you are not out for a fast buck. "Lots
of money is thrown on the table in front of you," he says. "But to get all of it
you have to do many, many wrong things." He himself is in Russia "to establish an
institution you can be proud of in 100 years". That would be 90 years after
Russia becomes "a G5 nation", Derby reckons.

<H2> <B>Michael Hawker </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Australia</I></B>

<P> During his first year in banking Michael Hawker was also playing centre for
the Australian national rugby union team. He says his employers were relieved
when he married and finished playing to concentrate on his professional career.
Now he is global head of financial markets for Westpac Banking Corporation, a
position he has held since August 1995.

<P> Hawker joined Westpac after three years working for Citibank Europe. At
Citibank he was a member of the European management team and the global financial
markets management team with specific responsibility for derivative products
throughout Europe. He was also an executive director of Citibank International,
Citibank's UK-based European banking operation. Before moving to London, Hawker
was deputy managing director and board member of Citibank Australia.

<P> Hawker's goal is Westpac's domination of Australian and New Zealand trading,
making it a prominent niche bank on the global stage. "We are constantly trying
to increase our capacity in Australian and New Zealand dollars. We are also keen
to strengthen the bank's capacity in commodities and in equity markets," he says.

<P> The increasing use of electronic transaction processing is the major
challenge facing global banking in the future, Hawker reckons. With banking
transactions becoming more standardized through the use of computers, the
structure of the business is changing and different skills are being demanded of
staff. "Your people are no longer involved in the transaction, they're involved
in why the transaction is occurring. You have to retrain them because clients
demand higher and higher service every year," he says.

<P> At the end of the three years Hawker spent in London his family wanted to
return to Australia, partly to escape the alleged greyness of the English
weather. His fondness for England is not affected by the fact that he is chairman
of selectors for the Australian Rugby Union.

<H2> <B>Menno de Jager </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>The Netherlands</I></B>

<P> Menno de Jager, one of three managing directors of the new ABN
Amro-Rothschild joint venture,was born in 1956 in Groningen in the northern
Netherlands, attending a commercial school before joining Amro bank in 1977.
Starting as a trainee in trading and sales, he then moved to the international
division in London in 1982. There he worked on non-guilder primary and secondary
products &#173; mainly fixed income in dollars, Ecus and Deutschmarks.

<P> Returning to Amsterdam in 1987, he was charged with rebuilding primary and
secondary trading following the closure of the London office. Soon afterwards he
began to concentrate on primary markets. Following Amro's merger with ABN in
1991, he became head of primary fixed income and equity, then head of equity
capital markets when they were separated from fixed income in 1993.

<P> Since returning from London, he laments having to cut back on two favourite
pastimes, golf and shooting. He now plays tennis: "although it's really more a
social event with the neighbours than anything else". He also took up flying just
after the first KPN privatization deal in 1994, escaping from his wife and three
sons each Sunday for a two- or three-hour flight: "It's a four-seater, of
course," he boasts. "But it's only got the one engine."

<P> De Jager has no plans to transfer to helicopters. "It costs twice as much to
learn, is very difficult, and in the Netherlands you can only land at airports
&#173; where's the fun in that?" The joint venture with Rothschild is challenge
enough. De Jager is confident of success. "The two institutions have got on for a
while, but especially in the KPN flotation. A couple of weeks ago we did the
Ffr1.3bn deal for Cr&eacute;dit Local, and we would never have got on the
Deutsche Telekom syndicate without Rothschild." Rothschild's advisory strengths
and ABN Amro's distribution capabilities look set to propel the joint venture
&#173; and de Jager's career &#173; ever upwards.

<H2> <B>Olivier Lefebvre</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Belgium</I></B>

<P> Olivier Lefebvre, 39, is the architect of the reform of the Brussels Stock
Exchange. His job as chairman of its management committee was basically created
through that reform. Lefebvre had no experience of managing a firm, but, he says,
he was told: "You are the guy that drafted it, now do it."

<P> Lefebvre received an MBA from Cornell in 1984 and a doctorate in economics in
1990. He started his career as a research assistant at the University of Louvain
in 1981. After two years in the economic study department of Generale Bank, in
early 1990 he joined the staff of Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance
minister. He became chief of staff there in 1993. During his six years at the
ministry he played a major role in reforming the money market, drawing up the
legal framework for securitization and reforming the stock exchange. As a result
he was chosen for the new stock exchange position.

<P> He joined the stock exchange in January of this year and some are saying he
is going to turn it around. Lefebvre's main goal is to transform the Brussels
stock exchange into a user-friendly firm and position it in Europe as an leader
in the network of equity exchanges. He feels his biggest challenge is promoting
an equity culture in Belgium. He's happy to take it on. "When I decide whether I
want to take a job, I use two criteria," he says. "One, will I learn something
and two, will it be pleasant?"

<H2> <B>Einars Repse</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Latvia</I></B>

<P> Einars Repse, 34, is possibly the youngest central bank governor in the
world, and when he is not overseeing Latvia's finances the licensed pilot relaxes
with another complex technical task &#173; building his own helicopter.

<P> With a degree in physics, Repse went from his first job as a computer
designer to become governor of the Bank of Latvia at the age of 29. "The new
government needed someone to run the central bank after independence and the
choice fell on me," he recalls modestly.

<P> But why him? When Latvia was fighting for independence from Soviet rule,
Repse became involved in the politics of his country. He founded the National
Independence Movement, which evolved into the National Independence Party that
still has seats in Latvia's parliament. As a result, he was elected to the first
democratically elected Latvian parliament, where he became chairman of the
banking and finance subcommittee. In 1991, parliament elected Repse as central
bank governor on a six-year term.

<P> Repse was in charge of setting up the new central bank, drafting the banking
law, and designing the currency reform. He is credited with being the author of
the concept of monetary reform in Latvia, and it was under his guidance that the
lats was restored as Latvia's currency in 1993. "My biggest challenge was
designing the currency reform, and I perceive the lats in a sense as my child,"
he says. "So my most important job is to look after the health of that child."
Repse's ultimate dream is that Latvia will once again become the developed
economy it was before Soviet rule.

<H2> <B>Nicolas Rohatyn </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>US</I></B>

<P> Nicolas Rohatyn is a rising star in a company that does not look with favour
on the star system. One of the youngest-ever JP Morgan managing directors at the
age of 28, Rohatyn now heads three of the US investment bank's central business
areas: emerging market operations, including sales, trading and research; the
foreign exchange group and the commodities group.

<P> Investment banking was a strong option for someone with the Rohatyn name. His
father, Felix Rohatyn, a senior partner at Lazard Fr&egrave;res in New York, is a
highly regarded investment banker and was widely tipped to become Bill Clinton's
secretary to the treasury in the early 1990s but remained at Lazards. During the
1970s, Felix Rohatyn was instrumental in pulling the city of New York round from
potential bankruptcy.

<P> After a degree in economics from Brown University, Rhode Island, Nicolas
Rohatyn joined JP Morgan in 1982 and worked in capital markets for the next two
years before moving to Tokyo to work on the bank's swaps book there. After four
years in Japan he returned to head JP Morgan's developing country asset trading
unit, a department that changed in the next three years into the respected
emerging markets sales, trading and research group. Between 1990 and 1994 Rohatyn
was chairman of the Emerging Markets Traders Association.

<H2> <B>Jos&eacute; Sainz Armada</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Spain</I></B>

<P> Jos&eacute; Sainz Armada, 37, was recently appointed finance director and
chairman of corporate banking at Argentaria, where he spends up to 14 hours a day
implementing a strategic plan aimed at turning the Spanish bank into a major
regional institution.

<P> He is the most prominent survivor of Argentaria's management shake-up last
May when the newly elected conservative Popular Party, which still controls 26%
of the former state-owned bank, hired a new chairman.

<P> "It's a good idea to have a master plan but it needs to be flexible enough to
react to developments such as Emu and interest rate movements," he says. "We
don't aspire to be a global bank. Our ambitions are regional, with an emphasis on
Latin America."

<P> Sainz Armada brings to his new job seven years' experience in investment
banking, primarily at JP Morgan's Spanish operations where he rose from head of
sales and trading to general manager before joining Argentaria in 1992 as chief
executive of its stockbroking arm and later the entire investment banking
operations.

<P> After an MBA from France's elite Insead in Fontainebleau, Sainz Armada
graduated in law and business studies from Spain's Comillas University. He joined
Morgan Guaranty Trust in Madrid in 1985 and moved on to JP Morgan three years
later.

<P> "The trend in Spain these days is to put in fewer hours at the office but
this hardly applies in my case," Sainz Armada says. "I'm in by eight o'clock and
normally I don't finish work until eight or ten in the evening." In spite of this
schedule, he manages to slip away for the occasional ski weekend and is a keen
runner. "I run whenever and wherever I can," he says. "In fact I'm happy to
practise any sport except golf."

<H2> <B>Peter Yngwe </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Sweden</I></B>

<P> Peter Yngwe, aged 39, is currently chief financial officer and treasurer of
Svensk Exportkredit (SEK), where he is leading the agency into a new era of
communication and preparing it for the reconstruction of the financial arena,
especially in Europe. SEK, which makes loans related to export transactions as
well as to domestic infrastructure and industry development, has been one of the
most active and innovative international borrowers in the past 20 years. Yngwe
joined SEK in 1984 after working at Ogilvy and Mather, Atlas System and
Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken.

<P> Yngwe is active in developing risk management in the financial sector, where
he believes pricing risk is an essential issue. He has as a central goal the
development of financial infrastructure worldwide and as a result his involvement
in eastern Europe is increasing. Since the beginning of 1995 he has been the
financial adviser for the Estonian Investment Bank and is active in other
institutions in the region. He initiated the annual Global Borrower Meeting in
which all supranationals and export agencies participate. He considers
dereregulation and the abolition of subsidies crucial to a more efficient
financial infrastructure.

<P> He took a BSc at the School of Economics and Business Administration in
Gothenburg, followed by an MSc in business administration and corporate finance
at the Old Dominion University, Virginia, continuing at the Stockholm School of
Economics on an advanced management course in 1994-95.

<B><I>Germany</I></B>

<P> Thirty-three would be young for a head of global markets at any bank, but at
the hierarchical and formal Dresdner Bank it's extraordinary. Dresdner is an
institution where few graduate trainees are hired before they're 28. Maybe
Leonhard Fischer would have progressed less rapidly had he begun his banking
career there. But he chose JP Morgan, and within five years had risen from a
trainee in New York to become local head of global markets in the Frankfurt
office. In April 1995 he moved to Dresdner Bank as co-head (with Erich Pohl) of
global markets.

<P> The unexpected appointment of Fischer was welcomed by Gerd H&auml;usler, who
has since left the directorate of the Bundesbank to take over Dresdner's money
markets division. H&auml;usler, himself only 45, says one thing that persuaded
him to move was that Fischer and several other German banking stars were already
working at Dresdner.

<P> Fischer faces an enormous task: the bank is desperate to become a dominant
pan-European bond house before losing its natural franchise when the euro
replaces the Deutschmark. A great leap forward was October's acquisition of
London Eurobond boutique Luthy Baillie Dowsett &amp; Pethick. Peter Luthy takes
responsibility for Dresdner's complete Eurobond business in all major currencies,
but reports to Fischer and Pohl in Frankfurt.

<P> Fischer is irritated by speculation about broader strategy in German
investment banking involving Dresdner. "I dislike all this adolescent talk about
London versus Frankfurt," he winces. "My ambition is less for Frankfurt than for
Dresdner Bank."

<H2> <B>Ant&oacute;nio Castro Henriques </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Portugal</I></B>

<P> Born in 1957, Ant&oacute;nio Castro Henriques is a senior executive and
member of the board of managing directors for Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP). He
is responsible for the international division and NovaRede, the recently
established retail banking network. At 39 Henriques is one of the youngest
members of BCP's main board, having served on it since 1995.

<P> Henriques joined BCP in 1988 and spent the next four years being groomed for
stardom in various divisions, including corporate marketing, interbank funds and
investment management arm BCP Investimentos. He joined the international and
treasury division in 1992 and in 1994 was made managing director of NovaRede

<P> BCP has the largest market share in retail banking in Portugal following a
merger with Banco Portugues do Atlantico in 1995. In recent years Henriques has
played a leading role in product innovation and business expansion. But investor
sentiment has not always been with BCP in recent years as the bank's share price
performance has suffered because of the expansion.

<P> Henriques, who is married with three children, is a graduate in business
administration from the Universit&eacute; de Paris IX&#173;Dauphin&eacute;, which
he followed up with an MBA at the Universidade Nova de Lisboa in Lisbon.

<H2> <B>Andreas H&uuml;bner</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Germany</I></B>

<P> After a few false starts on his career path, including spells as a tennis pro
and ski instructor, Andreas H&uuml;bner chose banking. Now 36, he is a member of
the board of Frankfurt-based investment bank Schr&ouml;der M&uuml;nchmeyer
Hengst. Born in southern Germany in 1960, H&uuml;bner joined the cooperative bank
in the small German town of Waldshut. In 1983 parent bank DG Bank sent him to New
York.

<P> After three years of training in securities and private-client business, DG
brought him back to Frankfurt to work in European institutional sales. Still,
trading beckoned and H&uuml;bner moved back into equities trading. His big career
change followed the 1987 crash: "I figured that as a trader you would only have
the great excitement of a crash maybe once or twice in your trading career so it
was time to go back to sales."

<P> From then on H&uuml;bner's rise was meteoric. Several clients touted his name
to the Lloyd's owned SMH which hired him to rebuild its US equity-broking
business. In 1989 he started the SMH small cap conference and in 1991 organized a
groundbreaking tour of east Germany for SMH staff that produced three
well-respected research products called Back to the Future. He went on to build
up SMH's US venture, its German domestic institutional business and its new
London office. In July 1994, SMH invited him to join the board.

<P> H&uuml;bner believes his task is now a major restructuring of SMH to make it
a lean investment bank. This he will do by strengthening broking and expanding
the bank's domestic institutional position in all products. Another goal is the
marketing and acquisition of asset management products.

<H2> <B>Philip Mallinckrodt</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>UK</I></B>

<P> Philip Mallinckrodt, 33, a director and co-head of equity capital markets at
Schroders, certainly has the breeding and pedigree to be a banking leader. His
mother is Charmaine Schroder and his father, George Mallinckrodt, was the
chairman of Schroders from 1985 to 1995.

<P> Although Schroders is now the largest independent quoted UK investment bank,
the founding family still exerts its influence there. Young Mallinckrodt is
nephew to Bruno Schroder, brother of Charmaine and the leading family
shareholder. The Schroder family controls around 40% of the bank. Bruno
Schroder himself spends more time on his Scottish estates than in investment
banking, though he is a board director.

<P> His brother-in-law is one of the pre-eminent figures of UK merchant banking.
George Mallinckrodt charted a course for Schroders which kept it independent when
the Big Bang came in 1986 and during last year's spate of acquisitions by
European commercial banks. The younger Mallinckrodt shows a similar appetite for
the cut and thrust of the investment banking business. He earned his spurs
outside the family firm, working for eight years in the hot-house atmosphere of
CS First Boston, a firm renowned for its unstuffy and vigorously entrepreneurial
culture.

<P> The younger Mallinckrodt rose to be co-head of equity capital markets at
CSFB, working in the thick of major European privatizations and other
international equity deals. He moved across to the family bank in March 1994.
Colleagues only wonder whether he will retain his hunger for the business.
Estimates of the worth of his trust fund range up to &#163;100 million.

<H2> <B>Bernard Migus </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>France</I></B>

<P> As a recent college graduate and a researcher looking to expand his horizons,
Bernard Migus approached French financial institution Caisse des
D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts et Consignations (CDC) on a whim. Eleven years later, aged
38, he is head of the bourse and capital markets division and can't imagine
himself in any other career.

<P> Migus graduated from French economics institute INSEE in 1982, taking a
research post there until 1984 when he went for military service. After that he
was ready for a change. "Research is fine," he says, "but it lacks concreteness.
I wanted to join the real world."

<P> Having "arrived at CDC by chance, really without knowing anything about the
business", he spent six months in fund management before moving to the primary
market desk to work on new issues. He stayed from 1985 to 1993, then changed
divisions to work with various instruments, including fixed-income derivatives.

<P> A year ago he made his most recent move, to head the capital markets
division. There he is responsible for basic capital markets activities: trading,
derivatives, equities and bonds. For Migus, the exhilaration of "making a deal",
when a client trusts him with a transaction, is what keeps him in the business.
"It's rather rare to do what you love. But for me, it's more than necessary. It's
fundamental. I need the passion."

<H2> <B>Alfred M&ouml;ckel </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Germany</I></B>

<P> Alfred M&ouml;ckel, 39, may be one of the youngest board members at any
German bank, but he is old enough to remember a different age in German banking.
"I started out in equity sales when it wasn't fashionable, and many people asked
me why I wanted to work there after such a great education."

<P> That was during his early years at Deutsche Bank's now-defunct trading and
sales department. After two spells at Morgan Stanley in Frankfurt interrupted by
a brief return to Deutsche's asset management operation, M&ouml;ckel switched a
year ago to BHF-Bank, where he heads its equities and asset management business.

<P> M&ouml;ckel does not disguise his ambition. He says that as a student at the
University of Mannheim's renowned business faculty his "aim was always to be in
the top 5% of any group and to be that bit faster than the rest". Now he has to
concentrate on holding onto his current position. As several board members
approach retirement age, he is well placed to increase his clout at BHF. But the
bank is also persistently rumoured to be a takeover target. Were it to be
swallowed by a foreign bank (UBS is often mentioned), M&ouml;ckel would be well
placed to rise to head of German capital markets at that bank. But if it passed
to another German institution, such as Commerzbank, he might be on the move
again.

From 1990 to 1993 he was deputy managing director of Investor, a holding company
with substantial interests in major Swedish corporations.

<P> Wallenberg's prime objective "is to ensure that Skandinavska Enskilda Banken
continues to lead in the Nordic region. The financial sector is undergoing
fundamental structural changes, maybe more evident in Europe than in the rest of
the world. Only those institutions that really strive for excellence will be well
positioned for the next century. By leading, I mean a combination of high

because he was "21 and it seemed interesting at the time". Finn joined the
two-year analysts' training programme at CS First Boston in 1982 after studying
economics at the University of Pennsylvania. He only intended to stay for the

steered over $200 billion of M&amp;A business to completion for CSFB.

<P> Finn is still happy working in the business. "I enjoy being hired by
businesses for M&amp;A because it's quite a compliment that they are prepared to
involve you in their most important strategic transactions," he says. And his
ambitions for the M&amp;A department remain strong. "I enjoy certain internal
successes: building a business, and helping people develop their careers."

just three years for him to become chief operating officer.

<H2> <B>Chartsiri Sophonpanich </B> </H2> 

<P><B><I>Thailand</I></B>

<P> Birthright put Chartsiri Sophonpanich at the head of south-east Asia's
largest bank, but hard work and a mild-mannered approach has earned him the
respect of staff and customers."He is very Asian in manner and very western in
his thinking, says Sathit Uthaisri, group executive vice-president at the bank.
Chartsiri's grandfather, the late Chin Sophonpanich, bought into the Bangkok Bank
on the back of his rice-trading business and took control in the 1950s. Chin's
son Chatri, who still retains "absolute power" as executive chairman, was
president of the bank until the end of 1994, before handing the position over to
Chartsiri.

<P> "Being the father's son and rising fast you have got to force yourself to
show others you have something extra. You earn it and work for it and that is
what he has done," says Sathit. After a US education including master's degrees
from MIT and the Sloan School of Management, Chartsiri, 37, learnt the ropes by
working his way through various departments in the bank, starting in 1986 as a
senior dealer and assistant vice-president in the foreign exchange trading office
after a year at Citibank. Two-and-a-half years later, Chartsiri was
vice-president of the marketing services department, before moving on to fund and
liquidity management. By June 1991 he was senior vice-president; a year later
executive vice-president and then in another year senior executive
vice-president, before securing the top job in December 1994.

<H2> <B>Ariful Islam</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Pakistan</I></B>

<P> Ariful Islam set up the investment banking group of Muslim Commercial Bank in
1992. Aged 37 he is now the senior executive vice-president. Islam started as an
executive vice-president at MCB and was soon promoted to his current position.

<P> Under Islam's direction MCB has been working on developing the debt markets
in Pakistan. "Working on the changes in the financial sector is an exciting
process to be involved in." says Islam. Privatization is another huge undertaking
for MCB. Islam is currently working on the privatization of Pakistan Telecom.

<P> An accountant by profession, Islam worked in London at Peat Marwick's banking
department, which gave him a lead into banking as a profession. He worked at
Faysal Islamic Bank in Bahrain and returned to Pakistan to open up the Faysal
Karachi branch in 1987 and became the chief manager.

<P> Islam feels he has been lucky. "In Pakistani culture, seniority is many times
assumed by your age and it is not common for young people to be in senior
positions," he says. "I came in with a certain view, and took the mandate which
allowed me to do what I'm doing."

<H2> <B>Farrukh Khan</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Pakistan</I></B>

<P> Born in 1962, Farrukh Khan was 30 when he founded BMA Capital Management with
four others. He is now chief executive. BMA is one of the leading securities
firms in Pakistan and a corporate member of the Karachi Stock Exchange.

<P> After a degree in economics and finance at the University of Manchester, Khan
worked as an accountant in London, starting his banking career at American
Express Bank in Karachi in 1986 as director of treasury. While at Amex he rapidly
took the treasury into new lines of business. Since starting BMA Khan has been
heavily involved in privatization. He was a senior member of the Kot Addu
power-plant privatization, the first successful utility privatization in
Pakistan. He is currently on the Jamshoro power-plant privatization team.

<P> Khan says being able to contribute to the rapid changes in the financial
sector in Pakistan is the most enjoyable part of his job. "At the end of 1991,
foreign exchange was deregulated, the economy was liberalized, and the stock
market was opening up to international investors," says Khan. "The opportunity
was there and that's why we formed BMA."

<P> In his spare time Khan enjoys playing with his one-year-old daughter and is
an avid golfer.

<H2> <B>Milton Kim </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Korea</I></B>

<P> In a country where the average age of top management in the financial
industry is about twice his 35 years, president and CEO of Ssangyong Securities
Milton Kim has to prove that his meteoric rise has been due to more than his
being the younger brother of the chairman of the Ssangyong industrial group. In
the president's office for less than a year, Kim has already raised eyebrows by
introducing a merit-based, gender-neutral system of promotions. Kim described his
own personnel policy as "a new concept in Korea"; the manager of a rival firm
called it revolutionary. In Korean securities houses, women usually answer
telephones and pour tea.

<P> The European-educated (Insead 1989) American-trained (Citibank 1986-88) Kim
has also chipped away at seniority-based salary scales. "If you maintain a
promotion system based solely on time spent with the company, your best people
will quit and you will be left with laggards," he says.

<P> Asked to rate his own performance since assuming the leadership of Korea's
fifth-ranking securities firm, Kim said, "It's been a bearish market but I think
I've set up the infrastructure so that we can deal better with changes in the
future." Kim is proud of is his introduction of a risk-management regime by which
Ssangyong monitors daily the $700 million in its proprietary accounts. One deal
that bears Kim's imprimatur is Ssangyong's 25% share in Caspian Holdings, a $150
million fund set up by Christopher Heath, formerly of Barings.

<H2> <B>Kongkiat Opaswongkarn</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Thailand</I></B>

<P> The paintings on the walls of the Asset Plus office are an eclectic blend of
traditional Thai art and modernism, mirroring its president's approach to
business. Kongkiat Opaswongkarn, 40, who is also CEO and the largest shareholder,
founded the company in 1993 and has developed it into Thailand's leading M&amp;A
and advisory boutique, straddling the best of both worlds by drawing on Asian
networking and adding five years of US education. His biggest deal to date has
been the $1 billion merger of department store chains Central and Robinson along
with IPO sponsorships and equity placements.

<P> He has now set his sights on region-wide cross-border deals. Kongkiat did not
set out to be a finance specialist, however, taking a first degree in computer
engineering at Chulalongkorn University before going on to a Pennsylvania MBA,
followed by an MSc and a PhD in operations research.

<P> Asset Plus is not the first business Kongkiat has started from scratch. At
TFB he was charged with setting up the first merchant banking division and the
first venture-capital team in Thailand. During his four years there he met
Baring's Christopher Heath and was asked to set up Baring Securities'
representative office in Bangkok. Kongkiat got to know many of his contacts
through lecturing and writing 18 books, including a Thai best seller on
entrepreneurship.

<H2> <B>Korn Chatikavanij</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Thailand</I></B>

<P> At the time of the October 1987 crash, Korn Chatikavanij was just 23. The
collapse concentrated the mind of the Winchester and Oxford-educated Thai and he
decided to return home after three years as a fund manager with SG Warburg's
Mercury Asset Management. As he turned 24 he joined forces with Finance One
managing director Pin Chakkaphak, bought a shell company and started Jardine
Fleming Thanakom Securities, in which both Finance One and Korn's family are
still major shareholders. He was president from the start of JF Thanakom, which
now boasts 310 staff, full Stock Exchange of Thailand membership and the one of
the highest market shares of foreign business in the country at 8.5%. But he
admits: "I have not reached the stage when it has been appropriate to sit back
and reflect. I do feel that luck has been on my side." The company is strong in
corporate finance with a good record in primary issues and M&amp;A in recent
years, being the first to advise on a public tender offer and on an all-share
takeover offer. Korn sits on the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission takeover
panel, and is a director of the Association of Securities Analysts. "I'm not sure
if I can live up to being a "financial leader in the 21st century," he says. "I
am a businessman that happens to be in the financial sector."

<P> Uday Kotak, 37, is the vice-chairman of Kotak Mahindra Finance Limited
(KMFL). In 1985 at the age of 29 he started KMFL and under his guidance it has
since grown from a fledgling finance company to a full-services financial giant
in India. Kotak has an MBA from Bombay's Jamnalal Bajaj Institute. He is the
chairman of the banking, finance and insurance committee of the Indian Merchants'
Chamber. Kotak is also a member of the Young Presidents' Organisation. Earlier
this year at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, he was choosen as one of
their Global Leaders for Tomorrow.

<P> When he is not working, Kotak relaxes by playing the sitar.

<H2> <B>Victor Li </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Hong Kong</I></B>

<P> As heirs apparent to tycoon Li Ka-shing's vast family fortune, Victor Li
Tzar-kuoi, 32, and his younger brother Richard could one day be Hong Kong's first
Hong Kong dollar trillionaires. The 1996 <I>Forbes</I> survey of the world's
richest men placed 68-year-old Mr Li senior third in Asia and sixth in the world,
with an estimated fortune of US$10.6 billion, based on his listed holdings. Then
there are his privately held interests.

<P> Although earning less than HK$100 a month in the late 1940s, Mr Li senior
managed to tuck away HK$7,000, enough to start his own company in 1950. He named
it Cheung Kong, Cantonese for "long river", a reference to the Yangtze. Cheung
Kong today has a market capitalization of HK$125 billion with vast interests
spanning property and infrastructure to telecommunications and shipping.

<P> Victor Li, who is being groomed as ultimate successor as head of Cheung Kong,
has had a somewhat easier path to the top than his father. A Stanford graduate in
civil and structural engineering, he developed his business prowess running the
family's Canadian property group, Concord Pacific, before being brought back to
Hong Kong a few years later to join the family holding.

<P> He was made deputy managing director in 1993 and deputy chairman in 1994.
Victor is also executive director of Cheung Kong associate Hutchison Whampoa,
director of Hongkong Electric, chairman of Cheung Kong China Infrastructure,
chairman of Anderson Asia, non-executive director of HongKong &amp; Shanghai
Banking and Hopewell Holdings, and a director of Hongkong Bank of Canada.

<P> When Hong Kong governor Chris Patten created his Business Council in 1992 to
cultivate closer ties with the business community, Li was among the first batch
of advisers appointed. He was also appointed a member of the Airport Consultative
Committee overseeing the construction of Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok.

<P> Beijing is as keen on his advice as the departing colonial administration,
having appointed him a Hong Kong affairs adviser. Earlier this year he was one of
14 new businessmen to join Hong Kong's leading pro-China think-tank, the One
Country, Two Systems Economic Research Institute.

<P> Victor Li, like his father, has a modest life style and fiercely defends his
privacy. He says he works not for money, but for love &#173; sometimes 16 to 18
hours a day. However, money he will get. Last year Li Ka-shing shifted his 34.95%
shareholding in Cheung Kong into a trust under his name to avoid paying
inheritance tax. Victor and Richard are its beneficiaries.

<H2> <B>Cyrill Noerhadi</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Indonesia</I></B>

<P> Few people in positions of power in Indonesia can boast that they got there
via a secret ballot in a democratic election. One such is Cyrill Noerhadi, 35,
voted in as president director of the Jakarta Stock Exchange in April. He was
chosen for the job by more than 160 broker shareholders in the privatized JSE in
a close fight against three other candidates.

<P> Noerhadi had high-level support. Two big government-owned brokers, Danareksa
Securities and Bahana Securities, backed his candidacy along with BZW-Niaga
Securities, the local branch of BZW, a big player in the market. They were
impressed with his work at the Indonesian Securities Clearing Depository, where
he proved his professionalism and competence in setting up a back-office system
that worked.

<P> Noerhadi, who returned to Indonesia in 1988 after an MBA from the University
of Houston, aims to boost the JSE's market capitalization, now $80 billion. A
raft of privatization issues is expected next year. Scripless trading and
division into three trading boards are also planned for 1997. Surveillance
systems are being tightened up as a growing number of local investors discover
the delights of punting on speculative stocks.

<H2> <B>Ajeya Singh  </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>India</I></B>

<P> Ajeya Singh, 38, is head of Lehman Brothers India.  Singh is responsible for
overseeing the provision of investment banking and related services to clients
throughout the Indian subcontinent, in addition to advising international clients
on opportunities in the region. He was appointed in 1995 to start the Lehman
Brothers office in India and give it direction. Under Singh's direction Lehman
Brothers led the largest equity offering out of India for the State Bank of India
this year.

<P> Before joining Lehman Brothers, Singh was director of corporate finance at
Bear Stearns in New York where he was responsible for investment banking coverage
of the Indian subcontinent, with emphasis on equity and debt financing, project
finance advisory and cross-border M&amp;A.

<P> Singh is a British trained chartered accountant and an associate of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants, England and Wales. He graduated from Mayo
College in Ajmer, India, and is married with two children. He enjoys  hunting and
squash.

is listed on the main board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.

<P> Tong's background is in stockbroking industry &#173; he became an equity

was at Morgan Grenfell for three and a half years becoming chief representative
and head of research for Morgan Grenfell Asia &amp; Partners Securities and also
director of marketing and research for Morgan Grenfell Asia Holdings.

<P> Tong lived in Canada for almost five years, taking degrees in business
administration and economics at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. Tong
doesn't seem to have much time for hobbies, but he enjoys jet-skiing, reading,

<H2> <B>Renee Zecha</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Indonesia</I></B>

<P> Perhaps it was the mini gold bars presented at the door. Or maybe the
high-status guests had something to do with it. Whatever, the Jakarta financial
community voted the opening party of SBC Warburg Indonesia at the Grand Hyatt
Hotel in September one of the better broking bashes of 1996.

<P> Usually publicity-shy Indonesian finance minister Mari'e Muhammed officiated
at the event. Up on stage with him was Renee Zecha, 38, joint-venture partner of
the new investment bank in Jakarta and its president.

<P> From Surabaya, Indonesia's second city, Zecha's family has a reputation for
quality. Her uncle Adrian owns the Amandari group of luxury resort boutique
hotels. Zecha was educated at an exclusive boarding school in Australia, going on
to a London School of Economics economics degree. After a few years at the
<I>Economist</I>, she joined Hambros Bank in London, specialising in Eurobonds,
and later moved to Citibank in Geneva.

<P> Back in Indonesia, she managed IPOs for HSBC from 1992 and then joined SBC
Warburg in 1995. The bank has advised the Indonesian government for 20 years and
has a star-studded list of clients ranging from telecom companies Telkom and
Indosat to Paiton Energy and Astra International. Zecha wasted no time in hitting
the markets after her office opened. In late September a flotation put blue-chip
auto maker Astra into play. No doubt Zecha has already covered the cost of the
presentation gold bars.

<P><B><I>Czech Republic</I></B>

<P> <BR> At 36, Petr Budinsky is the youngest of the seven-member managing board
of Komercni Banka, the biggest Czech bank. He is usually one of the first ports
of call for visiting foreign bankers and analysts. He assumed his position as one
of six deputy chief executives in May 1995 after serving two years on Komercni's
supervisory board as the elected representative of its staff.

<P> Budinsky is sometimes tipped as a possible successor to Richard Salzmann,
Komercni's 67-year-old chairman and chief executive who last month left to run as
a candidate for the Civic Democratic Party in the Czech Republic's inaugural
senate elections. Although Salzmann says he will remain chairman of Komercni
whatever the electoral outcome, it is understood his heir is being groomed.
Although Budinsky has talent on his side, he is probably too young for this role
&#173; a little grey hair is a prerequisite for eminence in the conservative
world of Czech finance.

<P> Budinsky graduated from the mathematics and physics faculty of Prague's
Charles University in 1984 and worked until 1994 at the Czech Scientific and
Technical University. During this time he also lectured at the Banking Institute,
where he taught asset/liability management and prepared courses introducing
bankers and financiers to stocks and bonds. In 1993 he became an adviser to the
newly established Prague Stock Exchange.

<H2> <B>Gyorgy Jaksity</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Hungary</I></B>

<P> <BR> Gyorgy Jaksity developed his taste for finance reading <I>Business
Week</I> in the library of Budapest's Karl Marx University of Economics in the
late 1980s. "At the time, Business Week was writing a lot about LBOs," he
recalls. Fascinated, he sought more on the subject.

<P> The university still taught Marxism-Leninism and central planning but its
library held sophisticated western finance journals paid for by billionaire
Hungarian expatriate George Soros. Jaksity could not have done better with a
Harvard MBA. Today, the 29-year-old is the chairman of the Hungarian Society of
Investment Analysts. He runs Concorde Securities, an investment bank and
brokerage firm he created in 1993 currently capitalized at $3 million. Concorde
holds its own against deep-pocketed multinational competitors -&#173;
consistently ranking among Budapest's top five brokers in equity trading volume
&#173; largely because of the quality of its research.

<P> Unlike many of his competitors, Jaksity is "completely unspoiled, completely
without ego," says Paul Greatbatch, who worked with him in Budapest in the early
1990s before becoming a director at Genesis Investment Management in London.

<P> Jaksity says his involvement in finance grew from his first love, philosophy.
"At the end of the 1980s, stock exchanges, finances, and investments had a lot in
common with philosophy &#173; their remoteness and strangeness," he said.

<P> Jaksity's college thesis was on Jean-Paul Sartre, and he published a novel
about Socrates in 1991. Jaksity says that, like Socrates, he's an ardent
questioner. "Taking this questioning view, I can make people be fed up with me
quite without difficulty," he says. But the questioning makes for good research.
"He's got a wry detachment from all the bullshit, a unique way of seeing things
in proportion," says Greatbatch.

<H2> <B>Mikhail Khodorkovsky</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Russia</I></B>

<P> <BR> Mikhail Khodorkovsky, 32, is the great innovator of Russian finance. A
chemist and one-time Communist activist, he floated the USSR's first public
offering for the Menatep bank in 1990. Then he imported TV advertizing to push
the shares. When the state yielded its hard-currency monopoly in 1991, Menatep
was first on the street with forex outlets.

<P> Khodorkovsky also divined when the time had come to stop undermining the old
regime and start cooperating with it. In 1994, Menatep became the first "brat
pack" bank to crack the lucrative circle of approved agents for state investment
programmes. Deepening relations culminated in a terse announcement early this
year that the state had purchased 15% of Menatep for shares in natural resource
companies.

<P> Menatep's foreign exchange expertise has won clients among Russia's
industrial elite, particularly in the oil sector. "Who would want to use
Promstroibank [the former state industrial bank] when they could do business with
Menatep?" remarks Alexei Antipov, financial director of the Komitek energy
holding. The infiltration climaxed in Menatep's takeover of Russia's
fourth-leading oil producer, Yukos, in a November 1995 loans-for-shares auction.

<P> Other Menatep holdings include the paper complex at Ust-Ilimsk in eastern
Siberia, and the Volga Pipe Factory. This portfolio ranks Menatep as the leading
rival to twice-bigger Unexim Bank among incipient Russian robber barons. "Our
role model is JP Morgan or Chase as they were in the 19th century," proclaims
Yuri Milner, who heads the Alliance-Menatep brokerage.

<P> Khodorkovsky has succeeded with a personalized organization full of trusted
old college friends, keeping his cards close to his chest and playing the
backroom bureaucracy like a violin. Yet these assets can be liabilities in
dealing with the foreign investors Menatep needs to capitalize its rich but
run-down properties. Yukos's stock underperformed this spring, largely because
analysts felt ill-informed. But Khodorkovsky is young and adept enough to regain
their favour.

<H2> <B>Wojciech Kostrzewa </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Poland</I></B>

<P> Wojciech Kostrzewa "is being groomed to supersede Mr Szwarc [current
president of Bank Rozwoju &#173; BRE]" wrote Robert Fleming analysts last month.
Although he's only 36, Kostrzewa spent five years as president of the Polish
Development Bank (PBR). Before that, as adviser to finance minister Leszek
Balcerowicz in 1990, he was in charge of creating Poland's insurance system from
scratch.

<P> Kostrzewa considers himself a "builder" who is keen to use foreign expertise
but he has an unreconstructed faith in local market forces. He laid the
foundations for an insurance industry after examining how it worked in the UK and
western Europe but believes that from that basis the Polish model should develop
its own framework, including self-regulatory mechanisms &#173; the state can
redress the more glaring faults later.

<P> At PBR Kostrzewa was the first to employ overseas bankers and now believes
the greatest challenge for Polish financial institutions is to "move beyond the
country's borders". This will be facilitated by Poland's likely future role as a
regional financial centre, he says. He has spent the last eight months travelling
to more established hubs, aided by Commerzbank which has a 21% stake in BRE,
Poland's largest private bank.

<P> After two years at Warsaw University, Kostrzewa's German links were forged at
Kiel University, where he studied economics between 1982 and 1987, and then as a
researcher at the Kiel Institute of World Economics. He then worked his way home
by helping the Polish finance ministry reform the banking system and implement
zloty convertibility. In 1994 the World Economic Forum in Davos selected him as a
member of its Global Leaders for Tomorrow programme.

<H2> <B>Csaba Lantos</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Hungary</I></B>

<P> Born in 1962, Csaba Lantos was 27 when he became the head of securities
trading at Creditanstalt Securities in Budapest. He is now the CEO of
Creditanstalt Securities Investment Fund Management, the fund management
subsidiary of Creditanstalt. It manages the assets of investment funds, pension
funds and other collective investment units.

<P> Before moving to Creditanstalt, Lantos was a bond trader at Budapest Bank for
two years after receiving a master's degree from Budapest University of Economic
Sciences. During that time Lantos was actively involved in the re-establishment
of the Hungarian Securities Market, the reopening of the stock exchange and the
creation of the relevant laws.

<P> Lantos has been chairman of the Board of the Central Clearing House and
Depository (Keler) since 1993, which was founded by the Hungarian National Bank,
the Budapest Stock Exchange, and the Budapest commodity exchange. He has been a
member of the council of the Budapest Stock Exchange since its foundation. He was
also for six years chairman of the supervisory board of Pharmavit, a Hungarian
pharmaceutical company.

<H2> <B>Vladimir Potanin</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Russia</I></B>

<P> Russian banking came of age this autumn when Vladimir Potanin, 35, was named
to the top economic portfolio in Boris Yeltsin's second-term government. His
appointment as first vice-premier for economic policy confirmed commercial
bankers' transformation from marauding Visigoths to pillars of the post-Soviet
establishment.

<P> Potanin himself was bred for high position. He graduated from the elite
Moscow Institute of Foreign Relations in 1983 and worked his way up the foreign
trade ministry. In 1993 he became founding chairman of United Export-Import Bank
(Unexim), which was established by a cabal of big hard-currency exporters
dissatisfied with their traditional state-owned financial agents.

<P> Potanin added a brilliant managerial team drawn from other under-40s who had
served in the elite state organs, particularly Vneshekonombank. "Nobody matches
their quality of service to the client," observes Sergei Rutkovsky of the Rating
consultancy.

<P> Within two years, Unexim was Russia's largest private bank, and fourth
biggest overall. Its old-boy founders realized too late they had hatched a
monster beyond their control. This became evident in 1995, when Potanin and his
colleagues dreamed up the "loans-for-shares" scheme, which allowed commercial
banks to take "custody" of controlling stakes in state enterprises. Unexim swept
up metals giant Norilsk Nickel and number-three oil producer Sidanco in auctions
that it organized itself.

<P> The means were not pretty but the auctions may have achieved their end &#173;
a revolution in Russian corporate governance. Unexim removed Norilsk Nickel's
hapless management after a bitter struggle, and shows signs of cleaning up their
mess. Privatization tsar- turned-Kremlin major domo Anatoly Chubais meanwhile
drafted Potanin to work on the biggest mess of all, the national economy.

<P> Potanin has started quietly in government. The early second-term battles
&#173; fending off Alexander Lebed and assaulting the industrial oligarchy to
collect taxes &#173; have been led by Chubais and finance minister Alexander
Livshits, both heavily scarred political hands. But Potanin did not get where he
is by playing second fiddle. Expect him to make his mark before long.

<H2> <B>Cezary Stypulkowski</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Poland</I></B>

<P> Cezary Stypulkowski, the president of Bank Handlowy w Warszawie, describes
the two years he spent working at Citibank in New York as the most important
influence on his banking career. Now he views Citibank's Polish office as his
most important competitor.

<P> Stypulkowski has ambitious plans for Handlowy. "We aim to be the JP Morgan of
Poland," he says. When in 1991, aged 35, he became Handlowy's president, he gave
himself 10 years to justify his boast. But his previous career as an academic and
adviser to the government on economic reform suggests he will build carefully,
avoiding impetuous leaps.

<P> In 1980 Stypulkowski began teaching and researching business law at Warsaw
University. He completed his PhD in 1989 and was then awarded a Fulbright
scholarship to Columbia University Business School, joining Citibank a year
later. That "was my real business school," he says.

<P> In the 1980s he also worked on the changes being undertaken by Poland's
Solidarity-led administrations. As a staff member of the office of the council of
ministers, he was an adviser to the economic reform minister, then to the
chairman of the economic consulting group in 1985 and in 1987 to the deputy prime
minister and secretary of the council of ministers' committee for economic
reform.

<P> Next year's challenge, he says, is the likely privatization of Handlowy. He
wants to entice long-term international investors, possibly as strategic
partners. But he will not neglect customers at home. "We have a reputation
overseas that needs to be properly vindicated," he says, "which means expanding
the bank's domestic corporate activites."

<H2> <B>Nurzhan Subkhanberdin</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Kazakhstan</I></B>

<P> Nurzhan Subkhanberdin, 31, the chairman of Kazkommertsbank, is a difficult
man to get hold of. But he wasn't shy about publicizing the success of his bank
on its fifth anniversary. Newspapers in Kazakhstan's capital, Almaty, carried a
full-page ad on October 18 detailing the bank's current financial status.

<P> Within five years, Kazkommertsbank has risen to the top of the Kazak banking
world &#173; only the state-owned People's Savings Bank is ahead of it &#173;
with a capitalization of $27.5 million and more than 12,000 clients. It holds
shares in other major local players, including ABN Amro Bank Kazakhstan (29%) and
Texas-Kazak joint-venture bank TexaKaBank (17%). In addition to serving as the
government's consultant on oil industry restructuring and privatization,
Kazkommertsbank has been tapped by the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and the Asian Development Bank for small business development and
agricultural reform projects.

<P> Some of the bank's success is attributed locally to former employees who
subsequently joined the central bank and the finance ministry. "Such ties are
always helpful," said one banker. "Kazkommertsbank is the government's
favourite." Others say the bank deserves more credit. "Its approach to business
comes close to any western bank," says Noman Siddiqui of ABN Amro. As for
Subkhanberdin, Siddiqui says: "He's keen on what's going on in the financial
world."

<P> Subkhanberdin isn't ready to stand still. The main challenges ahead include
tightening up on questionable loans and increasing capitalization. He recently
received the go-ahead for a third share issue of Kt1.9 billion ($27.6 million)
slated for early 1997.

<H2> <B><BR> Gustavo Franco</B> </H2> 

<P><B><I>Brazil</I></B>

<P> <BR> Gustavo Franco, considered by many the "intellectual father" of the Real
plan, which halted Brazilian hyperinflation in mid-1994, tends to raise
controversy and respect in equal measures. Number two at the central bank, where
he is director for international affairs, he is not afraid to use colourful
language to defend his tough positions on inflation and spending cuts. He was
criticized recently by MIT economics professor Rudiger Dornbush for maintaining
an overly tight monetary policy to the detriment of growth. Franco responded that
if growth had to suffer, so be it: constant vigilance against inflation was
necessary, he said, as was waging "guerrilla war" on fiscal spending.

<P> Franco is a Harvard-educated economist and fond of showing off his English.
He made his way to the top of the central bank, at what in Brazil is considered a
remarkably youthful 40, via a teaching stint at a Rio de Janeiro university, and
consultancies for public and private organizations including Rio's finance
ministry, the central bank and Shell. In 1993, he became deputy secretary for
economic policy at Brazil's finance ministry.

<P> Franco, is supremely self-confident &#173; some label it arrogance &#173; and
has written six books and countless academic articles. A recent piece advocated a
radical opening of the Brazilian economy. Franco has the intellectual capability
to ward off criticism. But the rising star of Brazilian finance often prefers a
simpler tactic &#173; his boyish grin.

<H2> <B>Raul Henriquez </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>El Salvador</I></B>

<P> El Salvador's undeveloped capital market will eventually take over the
financing of the country's longer-term projects. When it does, Raul Henriquez,
the entrepreneurial chairman of Grupo Financiero Capital, the only Salvadorean
group devoted exclusively to investment banking and brokerage services, is sure
to be in the thick of the action.

<P> The son of a businessman, Henriquez was born in 1961 and studied at Georgia
Tech and the University of Florida. After an MBA at the University of
Pennsylvania he joined the Miami office of futures brokerage Refco.

<P> In 1989 Henriquez established independent broker/dealer Hencorp in Miami,
later turning it into Hencorp Becstone &amp; Co. In 1992, following the
announcement that a stock market was to be set up in El Salvador, Henriquez
started an asset management entity and brokerage house Capitales there.

<P> Three years later, having purchased a controlling interest in Salvadorean
bank Banfidex, he established Grupo Financiero Capital, comprising a brokerage
and investment bank Banco Capital.

<P> The latter has been involved with commercial paper traded on the local stock
exchange as well as corporate finance advisory work &#173; it has recently
completed its first M&amp;A deal, a medium-sized hotel. Henriquez expects El
Salvador's debt and equity capital markets to develop briskly after 1997
following expected pension reforms. "We're banking on investment and savings
rates increasing dramatically," he says.

<P> Henriquez is keen on water-skiing, skiing, tennis and reading. He is married
with three children.

<H2> <B>Martin Werner</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Mexico</I></B>

<P> Martin Werner, 33, has become the man most associated with Mexico's recent
operations on the international debt markets, whereby debt repayment problems
have been substantially eased through swaps, new issues and early pay-backs. As
general director of public debt at the finance ministry, Werner was responsible
for such spectacular deals as April's 30-year global bond. Holders of $1.7
billion of Brady bonds were persuaded to swap their collateralized paper for pure
Mexican risk, lengthening the maturity of the sovereign debt and reducing the
country's immediate servicing costs.

<P> Known as a technocrat, though a politically astute one, Werner graduated in
economics in Mexico from a Mexican university and then presented a PhD on public
debt at Yale. Back in Mexico he was appointed to the planning ministry where he
got to know Ernesto Zedillo, who became Mexico's president in 1995.

<P> There, too, he got to know Guillermo Ortiz, now Mexico's finance minister.
When Ortiz was named as communications minister in the new Zedillo government,
Werner was put in charge of the liberalization of the telecommunications <BR>
sector.

<P> But the disastrous Mexican devaluation of December 1994 interrupted this and
Werner was off again, this time following Ortiz to the finance ministry. Since
February 1995 he has been in charge of public debt.

<P> A friend describes Werner as "a brilliant fellow, a little bit of an academic
but with a great amount of sensitivity to understanding political and social
changes". Werner is not Mexican-born, which excludes him from the presidency, but
most other jobs look well within his grasp.

<P> <BR> Hassan Ait Ali founded Upline Securities in 1993 to provide research for
international investors in Morocco's secondary debt market. It is now one of the
country's leading investment banking boutiques. Born in 1963, the son of a middle
manager in a state-owned fruit exporting company, Hassan studied business
administration in Belgium. Returning to Morocco, he worked for US computer
systems company NCR for two years before founding Upline.

<P> Upline's original clients soon began to show an interest in equities,
although at the time in Morocco only banks could act as stockbrokers. Hassan and
his team nevertheless provided equity research and acted as an agent for fund
managers.

<P> When the new stock exchange law was passed in September 1993, Upline became a
fully fledged broker. It is now the only fully independent brokerage in Morocco,
owned 50% by Finacor and 50% by its founders.

<P> In April 1995 Upline was mandated to be global coordinator of the
privatization of Credit Eqdom, Morocco's largest consumer-credit company. There
have so far been no private-sector IPOs in Morocco but Upline is keeping track of
possible candidates. Upline is Morocco's designated data provider for Datastream
and acts as the local correspondent for the IFC, helping with its emerging
markets index.

<P> Hassan, who is married with a son, enjoys reading, jogging and football "once

<H2> <B>Mohamed Alabbar</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Dubai</I></B>

<P> Mohamed Alabbar has played a key role in planning the transformation of Dubai
into a trading, financial and tourism centre as oil revenues decline. Aged 40, he
has reached as senior a level as is possible for someone not a direct member of
the ruling Makhtoum family. He has direct access to the ruler and a wide-ranging
economic brief.

<P> A fluent, articulate, charismatic figure, Alabbar by instinct likes to take
the more adventurous option, say friends and colleagues. He is a strong supporter
of free trade, is a leading advocate of an opening of the local economy to
competition and backs plans to establish a stock market.

<P> He has supported liberalization energetically at the economic department
where he has been director general since 1993. The department, whose
responsibilities range from strategic planning to day-to-day implementation of
business legislation, is now finalizing five- and 15-year plans for the emirate.

<P> Alabbar was educated at the University of Seattle, where he studied finance
and business administration. He trained at the IMF before working as manager of
the banking supervision department at the UAE Central Bank and then as director
and director general of Al Khaleej Investments.

<P> Although there are several courses in Dubai, golf attracts few locals.
Alabbar is an enthusiastic exception and a friend of top golfer Greg Norman.

<H2> <B>Amyn Alami </B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Morocco</I></B>

<P> A quietly-spoken man with a penetrating gaze, Amyn Alami reckons his mission
as chairman of the Casablanca Stock Exchange is to promote it as an investment
centre for the Middle East as a whole. He expects to have a new electronic system
in place by the end of this year and a new central depository by next March.
Then, he says, the CSE will measure up to the best.

<P> The son of a lawyer, Alami was born in 1962 in Casablanca and studied
economics and political science in Paris. He joined Edmond de Rothschild in 1987,
working in its futures broking subsidiary. He headed research and started the
first market-making activity on Matif futures spreads. He was also an arbitrageur
on Matif, CBOT and Liffe. Later, at the parent bank, he founded the new products
department and started the first guaranteed-return mutual funds.

<P> Alami returned to Casablanca in 1992 to co-found Morocco's first investment
bank, Casablanca Finance Group. CFG is active in M&amp;A, brokerage, trading and
asset management. Alami says he now spends 70% of his time at the CSE and "the
other 70%" at CFG as its chief executive. Then there's swimming, water-skiing,
skiing and karting, as well as the cinema and reading history books. Alami is
married with two children.

<H2> <B>Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Alsaud</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Saudi
Arabia</I><BR> <BR> </B>Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Alsaud is at 39
recognized as one of the great merchant princes of international investment. A
grandson of King Abdulaziz, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, he is renowned as
a bold financier and a philanthropist who scours the world's markets for bank or
hotel stock.

<P> After education at San Francisco's Manlo College, he was told by his father
to make his own way in business, being given $15,000 to start him off. He used
this to set up a construction company and his wealth is now estimated at $10
billion. "They say there are old and bold pilots &#173; well he is very bold,"
says one banker.

<P> He enjoys the fruits of his work &#173; owning 250 cars, Donald Trump's
former yacht and a Boeing 727 &#173; but is also renowned for his generosity,
supporting needy fellow countrymen and Bosnian Muslims.

<P> He hit the headlines in the west when he bailed out Citicorp in 1991 by
buying a 9.9 per cent stake in the bank for $800 million.

<P> Later he mounted a rescue operation for theme park EuroDisney. He also owns
Four Seasons Luxury Hotels and Saks Fifth Avenue and has banking, TV and property
interests in Saudi Arabia.

<H2> <B>Omar Masri</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Jordan</I></B>

<P> Omar Masri, 28, is a leading specialist in Middle East markets with the
expertise to steer investors through a difficult but potentially profitable
sector and help attract funds to a region that desperately needs financial
resources.

<P> After a meteoric rise through US and British banks, Masri moved to Amman,
Jordan, to set up Atlas Investment Group. This financial services company will
specialize in developing the emerging markets of the Middle East and North Africa
for foreign institutional investors. In particular it is focusing on the Amman
Financial Market and the Palestine Securities Exchange and has already formed one
joint venture, with Arab Bank.

<P> Masri says the company will focus on research and "brokering equities and
fixed income securities, local underwriting and advisory work and specialist
funds investing in the Middle East and north Africa".

<P> Masri, who is on the board of Arab Palestine Investment Bank and other local
companies, was educated at George Washington University, Washington, DC, before
training with Arab Bank.

<P> He worked for three years as an international banking officer with
CoreStates/Philadelphia National Bank in the US and then moved to London with
Foreign and Colonial Emerging Markets. As a fund manager there, he played a key
role in structuring, marketing and managing the first regional Middle East fund.

<H2> <B>Ken Ofori-Atta</B> </H2> <P> <B><I>Ghana</I></B>

<P> Six years ago, Ken Ofori-Atta quit Wall Street and returned to his native
Ghana to found the country's first investment bank. A boutique concentrating on
corporate finance, stockbroking, asset management and research, Databank last
year earned over $1 million in revenues.

<P> Ofori-Atta was born in 1959 and grew up in the small town of Kibi, later
moving to Accra. He studies economics at Columbia University in New York before
joining Morgan Stanley in 1984. Later he did an MBA at Yale and worked in
corporate finance and M&amp;A for Salomon Brothers.

<P> Last year Ofori-Atta and his team at Databank lead-managed Ghana's first
oversubscribed IPO, for Home Finance Company. They have handled two more since,
and in October arranged the first corporate bond to be listed on the Ghana Stock
Exchange &#173; a $35 million shelf offering, also on behalf of HFC. Databank now
has a 65% brokerage market share on the GSE.

<P> Ofori-Atta hopes Databank will ultimately build a presence in other west
African countries and on the regional stock exchange in Abidjan, C&ocirc;te
d'Ivoire. He aims to create the first indigenous west Africa fund, with
relationships in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal.

<P> "We hope that by December we'll take down the first tranche of around $10
million," he says. "Half will be invested in the shares of company listed on the
stock markets and half in direct investments. Within three years we hope to be
the leading investment bank on the west coast."
