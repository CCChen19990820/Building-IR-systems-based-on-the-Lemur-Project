	<!-- Body text goes here -->

  The failure of Warren's argument can be seen in light of the distinction
  between being a person and functioning as a person.  Consider Warren's
  five characteristics of a person: consciousness, reasoning, self-motivated
  activity, the capacity to communicate, and the presence of self-concepts.
  Imagine a person in a deep, dreamless sleep.  She is not conscious, she
  cannot reason, etc.; she lacks all five of these traits.  She is not functioning
  as a person; that is part of what being asleep means.  But of course she
  is a person, she retains fully her status of being a person, and killing her
  while asleep is just as wrong as killing her while she is awake and
  functioning as a person.<P>

        Functioning as a person refers to all the activities proper to persons
  as persons, to thinking in the broadest sense.  It includes reasoning,
  deciding, imagining, talking, experiencing love and beauty, remembering,
  intending, and much more.  The term <EM>function</EM> does not refer here 
to bodily
  functions, but rather to those of the mind, though certain bodily
  functions, especially those of the brain, are necessary conditions for
  functioning as a person.<P>

        When Warren points out that a fetus satisfies none of the five traits
  she mentions, she shows only that a fetus does not function as a person,
  not that it lacks the being of a person, which is the crucial thing.<P>

        At this point several objections are likely to be raised: First, the
  sleeping person will soon wake up and function as a person, while the
  being in the womb will not.<P>

        In reply, neither the sleeping person nor the being in the womb now
  display the qualities of a functioning person.  Both will display them.  It is
only a matter of time.  Why should the one count as a real person because
the time is short, while the other does not, simply because in her case the
time is longer?<P>

      Second, the sleeping adult was already self-conscious, had already
solved some problems.  Therefore, she has a history of functioning as a
person.  The child in the womb has no such history.  Thus Tooley argues
that "an organism cannot have a serious right to life [be a person] unless
it either now possesses, or did possess at some time in the past, the
concept of a self... [what is required for functioning as a person]."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#12>12</A></SUP> The
human being sound asleep counts as a person because she once functioned as 
a person; the child never did, so she does not count as a person.<P>

      True, there is a difference with respect to past functioning, but the
difference is not morally relevant.  The reason the child never functioned
as a person is because her capacity to do so is not yet sufficiently
developed.  It cannot be, for she is near the beginning of her existence, in
the first phase of her life.<P>

      Imagine a case of two children.  One is born comatose. and he will
remain so until the age of nine.  The other is healthy at birth, but as soon
as she achieves the concept of a continuing self for a brief time, she, too,
lapses into a coma, from which she will not emerge until she is nine.  Can
anyone seriously hold that the second child is a person with a right to life,
while the first child is not?  In one case, self-awareness will come only after
nine years have elapsed, in the other, it will return.  In both cases, 
self-awareness will grow and develop.  Picture the two unconscious children
lying side by side.  Almost nine years have passed.  Would it not be absurd
to say that only one of them is a person, that there is some essential,
morally relevant, difference between them?  Imagine someone about to kill
both of them.  Consistent with his theory, Tooley would have to say: "You
may kill the first, for he is not a person.  He is human only in the genetic
sense, since he has no history of functioning as a person.  You may not kill
the second, since she does have such a history." If this distinction is
absurd when applied to the two born human beings, is it any less absurd
when applied to two human beings, one born (asleep in a bed), the other
preborn (sleeping in the womb)?<P>

      In short, when it comes to functioning as a person, there is no moral
difference between "did, but does not" (the sleeping adult) and "does not,
but will." (the small child).<P>

      Third, a sleeping person has the capacity to function as a person and
therefore counts as being a person, even though this capacity is not now
actualized.  In contrast, a child in the womb lacks this capacity, so he does
not count as being a person.<P>

       This is the most fundamental objection, and probably underlies the
  preceding two objections.  In considering it, compare the following beings:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
              A. A normal adult, sound asleep, not conscious.<P>
              B. An adult in a coma from which he will emerge in, say, six
                months and function normally as a person.<P>
              C. A normal newborn baby.<P>
              D. A normal baby soon to be born.<P>
              E. A normal "well proportioned small scale baby" in the womb
                 at seven weeks.<P>
              F. A normal embryo or zygote.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

       Case A, the normal adult sound asleep, is someone who has the
  being of a person. who is not now functioning as a person, and who clearly
  has the capacity to function as a person.  I want to show now that all the
  other cases are essentially similar to this one.  That is, if case A is a
  person - a full-fledged member of the moral community, a being with a
  right to life, whose value lies in his own being and dignity, and not merely
  in his significance for others (like natural resources and works of art), a
  being whose willful destruction is murder - each of the other cases is a
  person as well.<P>

       The objection claims that the being in the womb lacks the capacity
  to function as a person. True, it lacks what I shall call the <EM>present
  immediate capacity</EM> to function, where responses may be immediately
  elicited.  Such a capacity means the capability of functioning, where such
  a capability varies enormously among people, and normally develops and
  grows (as a result of learning and other experiences).<P>

       The capability of functioning as a person is grounded in the basic
  inherent capacity to function.  This is proper to the being of a person and
  it has a physical basis, typically the brain and nervous system.  It is a capacity 
that grows and develops as the child grows and develops.<P>

       This basic inherent capacity may be fully accessible, as in a normal
  sleeping adult.  It then exists in its present immediate form.  It may also
  exist in other forms where it is latent, as in reversible coma.  I shall call
  this the latent-1 capacity, where the basic inherent capacity is present
  but temporally damaged or blocked.  In a small child, the basic inherent
  capacity is there but insufficiently developed for the child to function in
  the manner of a normal adult.  I shall call this the latent-2 capacity.<P>

       Let me turn to the actual refutation of this objection.  I will begin with
  cases A through E (replies 1 and 2), then case F (3), then abnormal or
  handicapped human beings (4).<P>

<OL><LI>The beings on our list, A through E, differ only with respect to their
  present immediate capacity to function.  They are all essentially similar
  with respect to their basic inherent capacity, and through this, their being
  as persons.<P>

       Thus the adult in a coma, case B, is not essentially different from the
  sleeping person in case A. Person B is in a deep. deep sleep; person A in
  a comparatively superficial sleep.  Person B cannot be awakened easily:
  person A can be.  Person B is in a very long sleep; person A is in a short
  sleep, say 8 hours.  Both have the basic inherent capacity: in A it is present
  immediate; in B it is latent-1.  That is certainly not a morally relevant
  difference.  If the status of persons is to be viewed in terms of capacity to
  function as a person, then surely a latent-1 capacity (temporarily
  blocked - person B) qualifies as much as a non-latent capacity (present
  immediate - person A).<P>

       Consider now the newborn baby, case C. He too has the physical
  basis for functioning as a person (brain, nervous system, etc.). Only his
  overall development is insufficient for him to actually function on the level
  of the normal adult.  He has a latent-2 capacity.  Thus there is an essential
  similarity between cases B and C, the adult in a coma and the newborn
  baby.  Neither has the present immediate capacity to function as a person.
  Both take longer than the sleeping adult (case A) to wake up from their
  slumber.  But both have a latent capacity to function, because they both
  have the basic inherent capacity to function.  In the case of B, the
  impossibility of eliciting an immediate response is due to an abnormality,
  which brought on the coma.  In the other, case C, this is due to the fact
  that the being is not yet far enough along in his process of development.
  In both cases the basic inherent capacity is there, it is merely latent.<P>

       Cases C and D, babies just after birth and just before birth, are
  clearly the same in terms of their capacity to function as persons.  Birth
  is, among other thirigs, the begining of vast new opportunities to develop
  the basic inherent capacity to function by seeing, hearing, touching. etc.,
  a capacity that is equally present just before birth.<P>

       Case E, a baby at seven weeks, has "all the internal organs of the
  adult";<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#13>13</A></SUP> and "after the eighth 
week no further primordia will form;
  <EM>everything</EM> is already present that will be found in the full term 
baby."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#14>14</A></SUP> 
  It is these "internal organs" and "primordia" that constitute the physical
  base for the basic inherent capacity to function as a person.  They are
  substantially present in both the very young preborn child, at seven and
  eight weeks (case E), and the older preborn child (case D).  Thus the cases
  D and E are essentially similar with respect to their basic inherent
  capacity, and because of this, their being as persons.<P>

        In brief, cases A through E are essentially similar.  Cases B through
   E are similar in themselves (each represents a latent capacity); and, taken
   together, in comparison with A (present immediate capacity).  There is no
   essential difference among cases B through E. If a person whose lack of
   present immediate capacity to function is due to a disorder (as in case B)
   should be respected as a person, then surely a being whose lack of this
   capacity to function is due to insufficient development (cases C through
   E) should also be respected as a person.  Both are beings with the potential
   to function as a person; and this they can only have if they have the basis
   for it, that is, the being of a person.  Case B represents a latent-1
   capacity, cases C through E, a latent-2 capacity; both are forms of the
   basic inherent capacity to function, proper to the nature of a person.  If
   a latent-1 capacity (B) is a mark of a person, then surely a latent-2
   capacity (C through E) is also a mark of a person.  Both B and C through
   E represent beings who will have the capability to function as persons,
   who lack this capability now because of the condition of the working
   basis of this capability (brain, nervous system, etc.). In one, that condition
   is one of disorder or blockage, in the other, the lack of development
   proper to the age of the being in question.<P>

<LI>The essential similarity among the beings A through E is also
   established if they are imagined as the same being: a being in the womb
   developing from seven weeks to birth (E to C), then lapsing into a coma
   (B), then recovering (A).  Thus if there is a person at the end (A), there is
   also that same person at the beginning (E).  It is the same person going
   through various stages, representing first a latent-2 capacity, then a
   latent-1 capacity, and finally a present immediate capacity.<P>

        I am now a being capable of functioning as a person (present
   immediate capacity).  Many years ago I was a small newborn baby, and
   before that a smaller child in my mother's womb.  My capabilities have
   changed, they have increased as my basic inherent capacity to function
   as a person has developed; but I remain always <EM>the same person</EM>, 
the same
   essential being, the being who has these growing capabilities.  If I am
   essentially a person now, I was essentially a person then, when I was a
   baby.  The fact that my capabilities to function as a person have changed
   and grown does not alter the absolute continuity of my essential being,
   that of a person.  In fact, this variation in capabilities presupposes the
   continuity of my being as a person.  It is <EM>as a person</EM> that I develop 
my
   capabilities to function as a person.  It is because I am a person that I have
   these capabilities, to whatever degree.<P>

        And so the basic reality is being as a person.  This is what entails your
  right to life, the wrongness of killing you, the necessity of respecting you
  as a person, and not just as a desired commodity like a natural resource.
  It is <EM>being</EM> a person that is crucial morally, not 
<EM>functioning</EM> as a person.  The
  very existence and meaning of functioning as a person can have its basis
  only in the being of a person.  It is because you have the being of a person
  that you can function as a person, although you might fail to function as
  a person and still retain your full being as a person.<P>

<LI>Let us turn now to case F, the zygote or embryo.  There are three
  considerations that show the essential similarity between this case and
  cases A through E.<P>

        First: The continuum argument applies here as well.  The adult now
  sleeping is the same being who was once an embryo and a zygote.  There
  is a direct continuity between the zygote at F and the child at E, through
  to the adult at A. If the being at the later stages should be given the respect
  due to persons, then that same being should also be given this respect
  when he is at an earlier stage.<P>

        Second: It may be objected that the zygote lacks "a well-developed
  physical substratum of consciousness"<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#15>15</A></SUP> -  that it lacks the actual physical basis 
(brain, nervous system, etc.) for the basic inherent capacity to
  function as a person.  This is incorrect.  The zygote does not lack this
  physical basis; it is merely that it is now in a primitive, undeveloped form.
  The zygote has the essential structure of this basis; a structure that will
  unfold, grow, develop, mature, which takes time.  As Blechschmidt
  states, ". . . the fertilized ovum (zygote) is already a form of man, indeed,
  it is already active.... All the organs of the developing organism are 
differentiation products of each unique [fertilized] human ovum."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#16>16</A></SUP> That is,
  the organs that form the physical basis for the more developed basic
  inherent capacity to function as a person (at various stages, E to A) are
  "differentiation products" of what is already present in the zygote.  Thus
  the zygote has, in primitive form, the physical basis of his basic inherent
  capacity to function as a person, in the adult this same basis exists in
  developed form.<P>

        The zygote actually has the basic inherent capacity to function as a
  person because he has the essential physical structure for this.  This
  structure is merely undeveloped:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        The zygotic self cannot actually breathe, but he <EM>actually has</EM> 
the
        undeveloped capacity for breathing.  Nor can this zygotic self actually
       think and love as an adult does, but he <EM>actually has</EM> the 
undeveloped
       capacity for thinking and loving.  And the human zygote could not
       actually have such undeveloped capacities unless he actually IS the
       kind of being that <EM>has</EM> such capacities.  Just as it is obviously 
true that
       only a human being can have the <EM>developed</EM> capacities for 
thinking
       and loving, it should be obviously true that only a human being can
       have the <EM>undeveloped</EM> capacities for thinking and 
loving.<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#17>17</A></SUP><P>
</FONT>

       Elsewhere, Robert Joyce remarks:<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
       A person is not an individual with a <EM>developed</EM> capacity for 
reasoning,
       willing, desiring, and relating to others.  A person is an individual with
       a natural capacity for these activities and relationships, whether this
       <EM>natural</EM> capacity is ever developed or not - i.e., whether he or 
she ever
       attains the functional capacity or not.  Individuals of a rational,
       volitional, self-conscious <EM>nature</EM> may never attain or may lose 
the
       functional capacity for fulfilling this nature to any appreciable extent.
       But this inability to fulfill their nature does not negate or destroy the
       nature itself.<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#18>18</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

       A being at the beginning of his development cannot be expected to
 possess what only that development can provide for him.  He is already the
 being who will later function as a person, given time.  The sleeping person
 is also a being who will later function as a person, only he will do it much
 sooner.  What they each have now - a fully developed brain in one case,
 and a potential brain, that which will grow into a developed brain, in the
 other - is a basis for their capacity to function as persons.  It is the same
 essential basis, one undeveloped, the other developed.  It is merely a
 matter of degree; there is no difference in kind.<P>

       One must already <EM>be</EM> a human person in order to develop the 
human
 brain necessary for the present and immediate capacity to function as a
 person.  As we noted earlier, "<EM>only a human being can develop a human
 brain, a human brain cannot develop before a human exists</EM>." "Human
 being" means of course "human person," the same being in different
 phases of his existence.<P>

       Third: Imagine a person J solving new and relatively complex
 problems (item 2 on Mary Ann Warren's list).<P>

       1. Person J <EM>is doing</EM> this.<P>

       2. Person K <EM>has the capacity</EM> to do this (like the sleeping person 
A on the list).<P>

       3. Person L <EM>has the capacity to learn</EM> to do this (to learn what is
   necessary for having this capacity; for example, a child in school).<P>

        4. Person M <EM>has the capacity to acquire</EM>, by natural 
development,
   what is necessary for the capacity to learn to do this.<P>


   What is true of person M applies to a newborn baby (C), or a baby about
   to be born (D), or a much younger baby, at seven weeks (E).  It applies
   equally to that same being at a still earlier stage of her development, as
   a zygote (F).<P>

        There is a continuity here.  If being a person is approached from the
   point of view of capacity to function as a person, then clearly persons K,
   L, and M are essentially alike.  Each is removed by one or more steps from
   the person J, who is actually functioning as a person.  None of these steps
   is of moral or metaphysical significance.  In reverse order from M to J,
   there is, respectively, a capacity to acquire, a capacity to learn, and a
   capacity to do what the next being represents.  If doing is to count for being
   a person, then surely the capacity to do, the capacity to learn to do, and
   the capacity to acquire what is needed to learn to do must also count.<P>

        This chain argument shows not only the essential similarity between
   the zygote (F) and the child at later stages (C through E) but also the
   essential similarity among the beings A through F.<P>

        We are now in a better position to understand the real significance
   of past functioning as a person, which is present in the adult (asleep or
   in a coma), and absent from the child.  It is a sign that the being in question
   is a person.  Because a certain being has functioned in the past, he must
   be a person.  But if he has not, or we do not know it, it does not follow that
   he is not a person.  Other indications must also be examined.  In the case
   of a small baby, born or preborn, including the zygote stage of a baby's 
existence, there are three such indications.<P>

        One, the <EM>continuum of being</EM>, the identity of the person.  The 
baby is
   now the same being, the same "self" that the child will be later on. "I was
   once a newborn baby and before that, a baby inside my mother." Since it
   is a human being's essential nature to be a person, this being - as a
   zygote, as a seven-week-old baby, as a newborn - is always a person.<P>

        Two, the <EM>continuum of essential structure</EM> for the basic inherent
   capacity to function as a person.  The baby as a zygote has the essential
   physical structure that represents this capacity.  Both in the primitive
   form of development and in all later stages of development, there exists
   the same essential structure.<P>

        Three, the <EM>continuum of capacities</EM>, to acquire, learn, and do.  
The
   zygote has the capacity to acquire what is needed to learn to function as
   a person.<P>

       If a being is not now functioning as a person, is he a person?  Two
  perspectives can be used in answering this question: present to past and
  present to future.  An affirmative answer in either case suffices to indicate
  that the being in question is a person.  Present to past: yes, he is a person
  because he functioned as a person in the past.  Present to future: yes, he
  is a person because he will function as a person in the future, based on
  the three-fold continuum.  The mistake of writers such as Tooley is to
  ignore the second of these.<P>

<LI>Let us turn, finally, to the case of abnormal, or handicapped,
  human beings.  Does the analysis offered here - that the beings A through
  F are essentially similar with respect to their being as persons, and their
  basic inherent capacity to function as persons apply equally to abnormal, or 
handicapped, human beings?<P>

       It certainly does.  A handicapped person (physically, mentally, or
  both) has the same being of a person as the rest of us who are fortunate
  enough not to be so afflicted.  He has, with this, the same dignity, the same
  rights as the rest of us.  We must "do unto him" as we would want others
  to "do unto us" if we were afflicted with a handicap.  Just as there is no
  morally relevant difference between a normal functioning person and a
  small child who cannot yet function as a person because of his lack of
  development, there is also no morally relevant difference between the
  normal functioning person and one incapable, or less capable, of doing
  so. Anyone of us who now has the present immediate capacity to function
  as a person may lose it through a severe illness or accident.  If that
  happened to you, you would still have the same status of being a person,
  the same dignity and rights of a person.<P>

       Even a very severely abnormal or handicapped human being has the
  basic inherent capacity to function as a person, which is a sign that he
  is a person.  The abnormality represents a hindrance to the actual working of 
this capacity, to its manifestation in actual functioning.  It does not
  imply the absence of this capacity, as in a nonperson.<P>

       The normal adult and child were selected for this analysis because
  it is in them that the essence of functioning as a person, or its usual
  absence because of (normal) lack of development, can most easily be seen
  and understood.  Once recognized there, it applies equally to all persons,
  regardless of the degree to which they are able to accomplish it.<P>

       To conclude this part of the main argument: would Mary Ann Warren
  admit the adult sound asleep to the status of person?  If not, she is saying
  it is acceptable to kill people in their sleep.  Suppose she admits sleeping
  Person A. She must then admit sleeping person B, the one in a longer,
 deeper sleep.  The only differences are the length and nature of the sleep.
 In each case there is a being with a capacity to function as a person, who
 will, if not killed, wake up to exercise it.  Clearly there is no morally relevant 
difference between them.  This proves decisively that present immediate 
capacity to function as a person is not necessary to being a person.
 This is plainly true of the newborn baby C. Having then admitted B as a
 person, Warren is forced to admit C as well, for the two cases are
 essentially the same: no present immediate capacity to function as a
 person, the presence of a latent capacity, rooted in the basic inherent
 capacity.<P>

      With this, Warren's whole argument is destroyed.  For she herself
 claims that, in terms of their intrinsic nature, their being (as persons or
 nonpersons), the newborn baby (C) and the preborn baby (D through F)
 are morally on a par.  Neither (her argument shows) can now function as
 a person.  Both, I have shown, have the basic inherent capacity to function
 as persons.  In all of these cases, there is the same being, with the same
 essential structure of a person, differing only with respect to the degree
 of development of the capacity to function as a person.<P>

      Views like those of Warren and Tooley do not reach the crucial point:
 the fact that a human being functions as a person or has the present
 and immediate capacity to do so, is not the ground for his dignity, preciousness, 
and right to life; rather, that decisive ground is the fact of his
 <EM>being</EM> a person.<P>
</OL>


<A NAME=Love></A><EM> The Reality of the Person Seen through Love</EM><P>

 Imagine a person you deeply love in a coma from which he will emerge in
 about thirty weeks, perfectly normal.  Apply Warren's five criteria.  He fails
 them all.  He is not conscious, he cannot reason, he is incapable of 
self-motivated activity, he cannot communicate, he has no self-concepts or
 awareness of himself.  This doesn't mean he is not a person; that he has
 no right to life of his own; that he could be killed if no one cared.  He is just
 as real, just as precious, just as much a full person as if he were now
 capable of functioning as a person.  It is just as important and necessary
 to respect him and care for him as if he were awake.<P>

      The child in the womb is in a comparable state, only his "sleep" is
 normal and is not preceded by a phase where he is able to function as a
 person.  He is also unseen.  But none of these makes a morally relevant
 difference.  If one person in "deep sleep" (inability to function as a person)
  is to be respected and cared for, then the other person should be cared
  for and respected as well.<P>


<A NAME=Distinction></A><EM>  The Distinction Applied to Some Pro-Abortion Views</EM><P>

  Given our understanding of the distinction between being a person and
  functioning as a person, we can now come to a better understanding of
  some of the things put forward by defenders of abortion.<P>

<OL>
       <LI><EM>Drawing Lines</EM>.  We examined ten suggested places to 
draw the line
  between what is supposed to be merely a <EM>preparation</EM> for a person 
and the
  actual person.  Every line proved false.  In each case the same fully real
  person is clearly present on both sides of it.  No line marks any real
  difference with regard to <EM>being</EM> a person: the person is there before 
as well
  as after.  But many of these lines do have a bearing on <EM>functioning</EM> 
as a
  person.  Thus a baby after birth interacts with others in a way not possible
  before birth.  A baby who has reached sentience has developed an
  important dimension of his capacity to function as a person.  And the
  presence of a functioning brain marks a significant milestone in the
  child's development as a functioning person.  If these lines seem to have
  any plausibility, it is because one has in mind functioning as a person.
  But the plausibility evaporates when one realizes that the crucial thing
  is not functioning as a person, but being a person.<P>

<LI><EM> The Agnostic Position</EM>. Realizing that these lines do not work, 
some
  people say that it is simply not known when a human person begins to
  exist.  What should be said is, rather, that it is not known when
  <EM>functioning</EM> as a person begins, for there is indeed no single place 
on
  the continuum of human life at which this begins.  It is a gradual
  development.  But the <EM>being</EM> of the person is there all along.  And 
the
  development is what it is because the being of the person is there all the
  way through: it is the person's development.  Agnosticism regarding
  functioning as a person should not lead to agnosticism regarding being
  a person.<P>

<LI><EM>The Gradualist Position</EM>. False when applied to the 
<EM>being</EM> of a
  Person, the gradualist position is absolutely valid when applied to
  <EM>functioning</EM> as a person.  That is indeed a matter of degree.  We 
gradually
  develop our basic inherent capacity to think and to communicate.<P>

<LI><EM>The Notion of Potential Person</EM>. False when applied to 
<EM>being</EM> a
  Person, the notion of potential person has a validity when applied to
  <EM>functioning</EM> as a person.  If by "person" we mean "functioning 
person," for
   example, a normal adult making a complex decision or reading a book,
   then clearly a child in the womb, or just born, or even at age one, is only
   potentially such a person.  A baby is a potential functioning person; but
   he is that only because he has the actual being of a person.<P>

	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

   The theory advanced by writers such as Fletcher, Tooley, and Warren
   holds that killing babies is permissible because they are not persons;
   whereas, in fact, they are nonfunctioning persons.  A functioning person
   is one who either is now actually functioning as a person, or has the
   present immediate capacity to do so.  What the theory holds is that only
   functioning persons (and those who were once such persons) are truly
   persons, it may, therefore, be called the <EM>functioning-person 
theory</EM>."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#19>19</A></SUP><P>

       Advocates of the functioning-person theory hold that it is not in itself
   wrong to kill human beings; that this can only be wrong when the being
   in question is a "person," as defined by the theory (one who has the
   present immediate capacity to function as a person, or has had it in the
   past.) Such advocates hold that the single fact that a being is human does
   not constitute any reason for not deliberately killing it.  Hence, they say,
   killing babies, born or preborn, is not in itself wrong.  <EM>If</EM> it is ever 
wrong,
   it is so because these babies are wanted and would be missed by adults.
   The thesis, as Tooley puts it, is that "membership in a biological species
   is not morally significant <EM>in itself</EM>."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#20>20</A></SUP> In the words of Singer, "Whether a
   being is or is not a member of our species is, in itself no more relevant to
   the wrongness of killing it than whether it is or is not a member of our
   race."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#21>21</A></SUP> Warren says that 
being human in the genetic sense does not give
   the being in question a right to life.<P>

        The thrust of this is to drive a wedge between two categories of
   beings - persons and human beings - and to hold that it is the former, not
   the latter, that is of moral significance.  There are two fundamental and
   disastrous errors in this approach.  The first concerns the category of
   persons, and consists in equating this term with functioning persons
   (present or past), thereby excluding babies who have not yet developed the
   present immediate capacity to function as persons.  The second error,
   closely related to the first, is to dismiss the category of human being as
   not (in itself) morally significant.<P>

        Proponents of the functioning-person theory are quite right in
   maintaining that there is a distinction between persons and human
   beings.  They point out that there could be persons who are not human
   beings, for example, creatures on distant planets who can think, make
   decisions, feel gratitude, and so forth. They would certainly be persons,
   without being human beings. In the Christian faith, angels are persons,
  but not human beings. So, not all persons are necessarily human beings.
  But, I shall maintain, all human beings are persons (though not necessarily 
functioning persons).  Being human is not necessary to being a
  person (there could be others), but it is sufficient, for all human beings
  are persons.<P>

       The fundamental error here is the notion that human is a mere
  biological category,<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#22>22</A></SUP> that it 
designates simply one of many zoological
  species.  If this were so, if the difference between human and other species
  were like the difference between, say, cats and dogs, or tigers and bears,
  then of course it would be morally irrelevant.  But human - though it may
  be viewed as a zoological species, and compared to other species in the
  study of anatomy and physiology - is not simply a biological category.  It
  is rather a mode of being a person.<P>

       <EM>Human</EM> designates, in its most significant meaning, a type of 
being
  whose nature it is to be a person.  A person is a being who has the basic
  inherent capacity to function as a person, regardless of how developed
  this capacity is, or whether or not it is blocked, as in severe senility.  We
  respect and value human beings, not because they are a certain biological
  species, but because they are persons; because it is the nature of a human
  being to be a person.  All human beings are persons, even if they can no
  longer function as persons (severe senility), or cannot yet function as
  persons (small babies), or cannot now function as persons (sound asleep
  or under anesthesia or in a coma).<P>

       The theory is correct when it says that it is persons who are of moral
  significance; and that persons need not be human persons (they may be
  martians or angels). The error is to fail to recognize that humans are persons.  
Being human is a mode of existence of persons.  So we should
  respect human beings - all human beings, regardless of race, degree of
  intelligence, degree of bodily health, degree of development as functioning 
persons - because they are persons.<P>

       "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Surely the
  class of others is not limited to functioning persons.  It includes all human
  beings; perhaps others as well, but at least all human beings.  "Do unto
  others" must include, very specifically, the lame, the retarded, the weak.
  It must include those no longer able to function as persons, as well as those
  not yet able to do so.<P>

       When we love another person, it is the <EM>total human being</EM> that 
we love,
  not just his or her rationality, or that which makes him or her capable
  of functioning as a person.  We love their individual mode of being,
  expressed in many ways, such as gestures, facial features, tone of
  voice, expressions in the eyes, etc.  These are, of course, in one respect,
  bodily features.  This does not render them merely biological in the
   sense dismissed by Singer, Tooley, and others.  They are dimensions of
   the total human person.<P>

        The present immediate capacity to function as a person is not
   essential to this fundamental reality, the total human being.  When a loved
   one is under anesthesia, he is still fully that person, that total human
   being.  More than that, part of the beauty, the charm, the lovableness of
   a small child is that he is <EM>only a child</EM>, not yet matured, not yet 
(fully)
   capable of functioning as a person.  The total human being in such a case
   does not even require the present capacity to function as a person.<P>

        Warren, Tooley, and Singer fall into the trap of seeing "human" as a
   mere biological category because of an earlier, and more fundamental,
   error, confusing person and functioning person (present or past), indeed,
   grouping the two together.  For if it is assumed that "person" equals
   "functioning person," and if a small child is not a (fully) functioning
   person, it follows that the child is not a person.  If the child is not a human
   <EM>person</EM>, "human" can then refer only to a biological species.  Once 
one
   strips the child of his status as a person (on the grounds that he cannot
   now function as a person), what is there left except his being a member
   of a biological species?  Separated from the notion of person, the notion
   of "human" is indeed only a biological species, and as such morally
   irrelevant.<P>

        The fallacy is, then, the separation of human and person, the failure
   to see that humans are precisely <EM>human persons</EM>.  Humans are 
human
   persons, where "persons" includes nonfunctioning persons as well as
   functioning persons.<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

   In arguing for his thesis that abortion is morally right, Tooley goes to great
   lengths to show that potential persons do not have a serious right to life.
   "There appears to be little hope of defending a conservative view [i.e., that
   abortion is wrong] unless it can be shown that the destruction of potential
   persons is intrinsically wrong, and seriously so."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#23>23</A></SUP><P>

        On the contrary, abortion is wrong because it destroys an actual
   person.  The assumption that the being in the womb is merely a potential
   person is typical of the functioning-person theory.  Thus Warren speaks
   of the "fetus" as a "potential person";<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#24>24</A></SUP> and of "its potential for becoming
   a person."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#25>25</A></SUP> She denies that 
the latter "provides any basis whatever for the
   claims that it has any significant right to life ."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#26>26</A></SUP><P>

        What is potential about the child in the womb is not her <EM>being</EM> 
as a
   person, but rather her <EM>functioning</EM> as a person.  That functioning is
  potential in the sense that she now has only a latent capacity to function,
  and not yet a present immediate capacity, because her basic inherent
  capacity has not yet had a chance to develop sufficiently.<P>

       The child in the womb is not, as the functioning-person theory
  maintains, a potential person, but rather a <EM>potentially functioning actual
  person</EM>. To be a potentially functioning person already ensures that the
  baby is a person, an actual, real, full person, for a potentially functioning
  person must necessarily be a person.<P>

       In the words of Joyce, "a one celled person at conception is not a
  potential person, but an actual person with great potential for development and 
self-expression. That single-celled individual is just as actually
  a person as you and I."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#27>27</A></SUP><P>

       I submit that there is no such thing as a potential person.  The ovum
  and the sperm are preparations for a new person.  Each of them is not that
  person in potential form, because it is not that person at all.  There is a
  radical break between sperm/ovum and the new person in the zygotic
  state.  The transition from "potential x" to "actual x" always involves a
  continuity.  Thus a medical student is recognized as a potential doctor
  because when the student <EM>becomes</EM> a doctor this will have 
happened
  within a continuity involving the same person.  In contrast, as Joyce puts
  it, "sperm and ovum. . . do not, even together, become a new human life,
  because they do not survive beyond conception."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#28>28</A></SUP><P>

       "The sperm and the ovum," Joyce says, "are not potential
  [personal] life; rather they are potential <EM>causes</EM> of individual human
  life."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#29>29</A></SUP><P>

	The Achievement View
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

  The <EM>functioning-person theory</EM> implies a certain elitism, something 
that
  may be called the <EM>achievement view</EM>, namely, that only human 
beings who
  have achieved a certain degree of development of the present immediate
  capacity to function as persons count as real persons.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#30>30</A></SUP> Thus Mary Ann
  Warren, Michael Tooley, and Peter Singer dismiss infants as nonpersons
  simply on the grounds that they have not yet achieved the status of
  functioning persons.  But why hold that against them?  That they have not
  achieved this status is perfectly normal, and could not be otherwise; for
  they have not yet reached that stage in their development over time when
  such a capacity is normal.  The achievement view is a clear example of
  discrimination: "You don't count as a real person, for you have not yet
  achieved the degree of development necessary for the present immediate
  capacity to function as a person."<P>

         The functioning-person theory is presented as if it were the product
    of careful, rational, philosophical analysis, a contribution to clear thinking.  It 
gains this appearance largely from the element of truth it contains:
    that the concepts of "person" and "human being" are not identical, for
    there could be nonhuman persons.  This hides its true nature, that it is
    in fact a form of elitism, leading to discrimination of the worst sort.  For
    the theory implies that only some persons count: those who have achieved
    the status of functioning persons.<P>
         "At what point in its development does a fetus become a person?" (Or,
    when does it become human, meaning a person, since it is obviously
    human in the biological sense all along.) This whole question is misplaced.  
For there is a person, a human being, all along.  It is only a matter
    of degree of development of the basic inherent capacity to function as a
    person. What we can now see, with new clarity, is that this question
    assumes the achievement view, indeed expresses it, and would collapse
    without it.  Translated, the question reads: "How much must a human
    being achieve in the way of attaining the capability of functioning as a
    person in order to count as a person, that is, a being whose life we must
    respect?" The answer is clear: nothing.  No achievement is necessary, and
    to demand it is elitism and discrimination.  What is required is 
<EM>being</EM>, not
    achievement: being a person, having the nature of a person, regardless
    of how far along the achievement scale one has progressed.<P>

         It is wrong for a white to demand that real persons be white in order
    to count as persons.  Blacks are equally persons, though they are
    "different." So too, it is wrong for a functioning person to demand that real
    persons be capable of functioning as persons.  Small babies, incapable of
    this - or less capable - are equally persons, though they are "different."
    Being white is not a special achievement that blacks have failed to reach.
    Having the capability of functioning as a person, while it is an achievement, is 
equally irrelevant, morally.  To demand it as a condition for
    membership in the class of persons is equally unjust and discriminatory.<P>

         It is wrong to discriminate against anyone who has not yet achieved
    the status of a functioning person.  It is equally wrong to discriminate
    against anyone who is <EM>no longer</EM> capable of functioning because 
of severe
    senility.  Likewise, it is wrong to discriminate against anyone who cannot
    now function, whether or not he ever could function in the past and
    whether or not he will be able to function in the future.<P>

         In the present context, in which we are analyzing a theory that
    raises - as a serious issue - the question of which human beings may be
    killed and which may not, it is not a matter of discrimination in merely
    a general sense, but something very specific, and particularly odious: it
    is a discrimination that takes advantage of a person's inability to function
 as a person and uses that against them as a pretext for killing them.  The
 effect of adopting the functioning-person theory would be to legitimize
 this taking advantage of a person's lack of ability.  This is sheer "might over
 right," power and ability over frailty and (natural) disability.  Those who
 have power and ability exercise it over those who do not - infants whom
 their theory can rule out as non-persons.  I submit that, quite generally,
 it is wrong for those who have the advantage of power and ability to take
 advantage of it over those who do not and to discriminate against them
 on the basis of this advantage.  Let me express this in terms of the following
 moral principle:<P>

      <EM>It is always wrong for persons who have power and ability to take
 advantage of their status by discriminating against persons who are
 powerless, especially in order to kill them.</EM><P>

      And, as a corollary: <EM>it is always wrong to take advantage of anyone's
 inability to function as a person by acts of discrimination that would deny
 that individual the full respect that is due to every person.</EM><P>

      This principle and its corollary apply not only to actions but also to
 rules and theories that would legitimatize such actions. Any theory that
 calls for or allows such discrimination is itself an immoral theory. (This
 is not a moral judgment on those who propose the theory, but strictly a
 judgment on the theory itself, in terms of its content and its logical
 consequences.) The functioning-person theory legitimizes the deliberate
 killing of small babies merely because they have not reached a sufficient
 level of development as predetermined by the theory.  This is immoral.<P>


<A NAME=Multiple></A><EM> Multiple Definitions of Functioning Person</EM><P>

 The <EM>functioning-person theory</EM> wants to divide humanity into two 
separate
 categories: "persons" and "mere human beings," who are nonpersons.  I
 have argued that this is a false division, that all human beings are
 persons, and that "person" does not mean "functioning person" but
 includes those with a merely latent capacity to function.<P>

      The falsity of the view that "person" means "functioning person" can
 also be shown in another way - that is, by carefully examining the notion
 of functioning person with respect to the definition provided by the
 advocates of the functioning-person theory.  What is this definition? What
 characteristics must a being have in order to be classified as a person?
 A survey of the current literature on this topic reveals a bewildering array
 of suggestions, some brief, some detailed, some at variance with 
others.<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#31>31</A></SUP> 
 Let us look at some examples:<P>

      Mary Ann Warren proposes consciousness, reasoning, self-motivated 
activity, the capacity to communicate, the presence of self-concepts
   and self-awareness as the characteristics of a person.<P>

        Peter Singer offers a definition of "person" that "selects two crucial
   characteristics . . . as the core of the concept": rationality and 
self-consciousness.<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#32>32</A></SUP><P>

        Joseph Fletcher proposes "a list of criteria or indicators" of "humanness" 
(by which he means personhood).  They include minimum intelligence ("Any 
individual of the species <EM>homo sapiens</EM> who falls below an I.Q.
   grade of 40 . . . is questionably a person; below the mark of 20, not a
   person. . . . The <EM>ratio</EM>... is what makes a person of the 
<EM>vita</EM> [life]."), 
self-awareness, self-control, a sense of time, the capacity to relate to others,
   and curiosity.<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#33>33</A></SUP><P>

        Michael Tooley, in his 1973 paper, "A Defense of Abortion and
   Infanticide," offers this list: (1) The capacity to envisage a future for
   oneself, and to have desires about one's future states. (2) The capacity to
   have a concept of a self, the concept of a continuing subject of experiences
   and other mental states. (3) Being a self. (4) Self-consciousness. (5) The
   capacity for self-consciousness.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#34>34</A></SUP><P>

        In his book, <EM>Abortion and Infanticide</EM>, Tooley observes, "There 
is very
   general agreement [among writers on this topic] that something is not a
   person unless it is, in some sense, capable of consciousness."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#35>35</A></SUP> Further,
   that "many people ... feel that mere consciousness is not itself sufficient
   to make something a person, and several proposals have been advanced
   as to what additional properties are required."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#36>36</A></SUP> He then gives a list of
   some of "the more important suggestions" for these additional properties.
   Fifteen are mentioned, many of them similar to those listed above.  Among
   the others are: (1) The capacity to experience pleasure and/or pain. (2)
   The capacity to have desires. (3) The capacity to use language.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#37>37</A></SUP><P>

        Tooley devotes a major portion of his book to his own proposal for
   defining a person.  His perspective is that of "a right to continued
   existence." His thesis is, "An individual cannot have a right to continued
   existence unless there is at least one time at which it possesses the
   concept of a continuing self or mental substance."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#38>38</A></SUP><P>

        A few pages later he says "that some <EM>psychological continuity</EM> 
is
   required" for one to be a person: and that "there must also be 
<EM>recognition
   of the continuity</EM> by the enduring mental substance in question [the 
person]."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#39>39</A></SUP> Putting them 
together, it seems that Tooley's criteria for being a
   person (as listed in his book) are: (1) being conscious, (2) possessing the
   concept of a continuing self or mental substance (at least at one time), (3)
   recognition of one's psychological continuity over time.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#40>40</A></SUP><P>

         Which of these definitions, or sets of indicators or criteria, or
    combinations of them, is the correct one for the concept of a person?
    Which features are necessary for being a person?  Which ones are
    sufficient?  Which ones are both necessary and sufficient?  This problem
    is further complicated by the fact that the authors cited here offer
    conflicting views about the features to be used in defining the concept of
    person.  Thus, <EM>rationality</EM> is affirmed by Warren and Singer, and 
denied by
    Tooley in his book.<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#41>41</A></SUP> It seems 
to be affirmed by Fletcher ("minimum
    intelligence").  <EM>Self-consciousness</EM> is affirmed by Warren, Singer, 
and
    Fletcher, and by Tooley in three of his articles.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#42>42</A></SUP> It is later denied by Tooley
    in his book .<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#43>43</A></SUP> <EM>Being an 
agent</EM> or having self-control is affirmed by Fletcher
    ("control of existence"), denied by Tooley.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#44>44</A></SUP><P>

         Which criteria are to be employed is one problem.  But there is
    another, equally serious problem.  Given a criterion or feature that is to
    be employed in defining the concept of person, how much of it is
    necessary?  How much is sufficient?  Mary Ann Warren, for example, in
    listing reasoning as one of the features, says it must be "the 
<EM>developed</EM>
    capacity to solve new and relatively complex problems." That seems to be
    a tall order! Why wouldn't reasoning as the capacity to solve elementary
    problems be sufficient?  In any case, how complex must the problems be?
    Or, more generally, what kinds of reasoning are to be required?  And how
    extensive must the ability to reason be?<P>

         All, or virtually all, of these characteristics exist in degrees.  Some
    people have more self-control, others less.  Self-consciousness awakens
    gradually in a child. If it is to be counted as part of the definition of a
    person, how developed must it be?  Parallel questions apply to the rest of
    the items on these lists.<P>

         There is still a further problem.  Even if we knew which features were
    essential to being a person, and also how much development was
    necessary, even then we would have the problem of measuring the
    features and their degree of development.  Given a small born baby, how
    do we know how much self consciousness the baby has?  And suppose a
    child has a given feature but cannot display it?  How are we to exclude
    such a possibility, so that we don't label the child a nonperson who is, in
    fact, a person?  In a lengthy section of his book, Tooley tries to grapple with
    the problem of measurement, by examining a complexity of scientific
    evidence about "neurophysical development."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#45>45</A></SUP> But such evidence, even
    if it were adequate, could only be indirect, in that it measures the physical
    requirements for functioning as a person and not the functioning itself,
    for example, having self-consciousness.  Needless to say, Tooley does not
    solve the problem.<P>

       The conclusion to be drawn from this is the following: There is no one
   correct definition of "person," in the sense of functioning person.  It is not
   that there is a correct definition but no one has yet found it.  There are
   many definitions, and a given being will be a person under one of them,
   and not under another.  It is similar to the term <EM>capable</EM>.  Is a given 
person
   capable?  Yes, for some things, or to a certain degree; no, for other things,
   or to a greater degree.  There are many definitions of capable, and the
   attempt to find the one true definition would obviously be misguided. If
   "person" is to be defined in terms of "capable of functioning," the same
   thing applies.  There can be no one correct definition of person as
   functioning person, because "functioning person" means precisely: one
   who has the present immediate capacity to function.  And functioning as
   a person means a wide variety of things, each to varying degrees, as the
   above sample of proposals amply demonstrates.<P>

       This wide variety, representing the plurality and complexity of what
   it means to function as a person, involves two fundamental dimensions.<P>

       One is <EM>gradual development</EM>.  The attainment of the status of 
functioning as a person is some thing that a human being develops gradually.
   During growth and development, both in the womb and after birth, the
   child gradually acquires more and more of the features discussed here,
   and each of them to greater and greater degrees.  There is no one moment,
   or even a short period of time (such as a week), where one could draw a
   line and say, "Before that there is no functioning person, after that, there
   is." Thus even if we had an adequate definition, consisting of features A
   through Z, that makes someone a functioning person, it would still be
   impossible to divide humanity into two groups: human persons and
   human nonpersons.  Whatever definition there is, a human being grows
   into the features that comprise it.<P>

       Consider self-consciousness: A human being is somewhat 
self-conscious at an early stage in life, a bit more later, still more at a later
   stage, and so on.  The point is not that we do not know when these stages
   occur, or just what degree of self-consciousness is involved during each
   of them.  The point is that self-consciousness is itself a matter of degree.
   And so a set of defining characteristics of the person, even if we had one,
   would have to be in terms of more or less. "Person" (in this context) means
   "functioning person," and a being that exemplifies more of A through Z,
   or exemplifies them to a greater degree, would have more capabilities of
   functioning as a person.  There can be no definition of person that picks
   out certain beings and excludes others; there can only be various features
   (such as self-consciousness) that different human beings exemplify to
   varying degrees.<P>

        The plurality and complexity of what it means to function as a
   person involves a second dimension, <EM>relativity to context</EM>; that is, 
how
   we construe the term person when it is used to designate "functioning
   person" varies from case to case.  Suppose, for example, that in order to
   be legally binding, a document must be signed with two persons
   present as witnesses.  Here a degree of functioning as a person is
   required that far exceeds the level attained by, say, a child of three.  A
   three-year-old would hardly be an appropriate witness for the signing of
   a will.  So the degree of attainment of present capacity to function as a
   person that we have in mind, and require, for someone to be called a
   person varies according to the situation, and is determined by our needs
   and interests.<P>

        There is no such thing as <EM>the</EM> definition of the term 
<EM>functioning person</EM>
   because the features that constitute any definition vary across the
   spectrum of gradual development, and the spectrum of context.  Hence,
   the definition itself varies: there is no one meaning of functioning person.
   This shows that the whole attempt, by Warren, Singer, Fletcher, Tooley,
   and others, to define the person is fundamentally misguided.<P>

        In her paper, "Abortion and the Concept of a Person," Jane English
   reaches what is in part the same conclusion; in part, because she fails to
   distinguish between being a person and functioning as person.  Her
   thesis is that there is no such thing as the correct definition of a person.
   She offers a refutation of the view that "the concept of a person can be
   captured in a straitjacket of necessary and/or sufficient conditions,"<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#46>46</A></SUP> 
   which is what would be required for an adequate definition of a person.
   "Rather," she claims, "'person' is a cluster of features, of which
   rationality, having a self-concept . . . are only part."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#47>47</A></SUP> Thus, "People typically exhibit rationality 
... but someone who was irrational would not
   thereby fail to qualify as a person."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#48>48</A></SUP> Her conclusion, in the first part of
   her paper, is that "our concept of a person is not sharp or decisive enough
   to bear the weight of a solution to the abortion controversy.  To use it to
   solve that problem is to clarify <EM>obscurum per obscurius</EM> [the 
obscure by
   the more obscure]."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#49>49</A></SUP><P>

        When this is applied to the concept of functioning person, it is valid
   and of great significance.  When, as in her paper, it is applied to the
   concept of being a person - and used as a reason for justifying some
   abortions - it is a serious mistake.  The analysis offered by English is
   excellent, but she draws the wrong conclusion.  What her analysis shows
   is that <EM>functioning person</EM> cannot be adequately defined.  Nothing 
follows
   from this regarding <EM>being a person</EM>, especially not the conclusion 
that the
   being in the womb is not a person.<P>


<A NAME=Practical></A><EM>  Practical Consequences</EM><P>

  Consider again the fact that the meaning of <EM>functioning person</EM> is 
relative
  to context.  When occasions such as validly witnessing the signing of legal
  documents arise, then a division of humanity into two groups is justified.
  Here the requirement of a particular level of achievement for functioning
  as a person is appropriate.  But when it is a matter of deciding who will be
  respected as a real person, and who will be dismissed as a nonperson and
  treated as a being who may be killed, the requirement of a particular level
  of achievement for functioning as a person is another matter entirely.
  Specifically, if it is in the interests of some people to kill a certain class of
  human beings, they can simply define them as nonpersons, on the
  grounds that they have not attained (or no longer retain) a particular level
  of achievement as functioning persons.  Abortion is an obvious example.
  When there is a strong predisposition on the part of some people to
  destroy a child, there is an interest that can obviously be used to draw a
  line in the scale of gradual development of the capacity to function as a
  person, designed specifically to exclude the child that one wants to get rid
  of. That line may come at birth, or it may come after birth, as in Tooley's
  analysis, which would justify infanticide as well.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#50>50</A></SUP><P>

       Since there is no one correct definition of person when that term
  designates "functioning person"; and since functioning as a person is
  something that develops gradually, any division of human beings into two
  classes, persons (who are to be respected) and nonpersons (who may be
  killed), must be based on a decision.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#51>51</A></SUP> This will be a decision based on
  interests, and where the interest is "getting rid of," any person falling into
  that unlucky class can be labeled a nonperson and killed with impunity.<P>

       Preborn children are a striking example of this, but they are not
  alone.  Parents who decide that their newborn child does not have a
  meaningful life because of a handicap, or who do not want to be burdened
  with the extra care that a child needs, can turn to the functioning-person
  theory, and use the achievement view inherent in it, to define their baby
  as a nonperson, in order to justify killing him.<P>

       When it is personal interests, utilizing the theory of the achievement
  view, rather than a person's inherent nature, that determines the
  morality of killing human beings, then ultimately no one is safe.  For the
  functioning-person theory that underlies the achievement view can easily
  be formulated as excluding not only those who have not yet achieved
  functioning as a person (as in Tooley), but also those who no longer can
  function as persons in a particular, specified way.  Thus if a person were
  to suffer a terrible accident that left him in a severely debilitated state, he
   could be classified as a nonperson and killed by those who wanted to get
   rid of him.<P>

        Ultimately, it would be a matter of power.  Those in power could
   decide the level of achievement necessary for being counted as a person,
   and whether it would be only a matter of "not yet" or also a matter of "no
   longer." This is, of course, what we see in the case of abortion.  Doctors kill
   babies, and not the other way around, because doctors have power,
   babies do not.  This applies in an immediate and obvious way to the
   physical level.  In general, the physically strong have the power to crush
   the physically weak.  That is nothing new.  What is new is the attempt to
   legitimize this by a theory: the functioning-person theory with its attendant 
achievement view.  The effect of this is that those in power can decide
   who will, and who will not, count as a person, depending on whether or
   not the human being in question had attained (or retained) the requisite
   achievement.<P>

        "Might over right" is truly frightening.  When it is raw physical might,
   with no pretense to moral legitimacy, it is frightening enough.  When a
   claim to moral legitimacy is added, it becomes even more frightening.
   Murder is perpetrated without even being recognized as murder. The
   results of the functioning-person theory and achievement view is that, if
   adopted, they would provide precisely such a pretense of moral legitimacy
   to murder.<P>

	The Dignity of the Human Person

	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

   The true alternative to might over right is reverence for the dignity of each
   person as a person; because he or she has the being of a person.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes7.htm#52>52</A></SUP><P>

        The important reality of the dignity of the human person can be seen,
   and taken seriously, in many ways, especially when that dignity is denied
   or under attack.<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#53>53</A></SUP> Slavery, 
child abuse, sexual molestation, and rape are
   among some of the more strong examples.  Or, a person with a physical
   handicap is severely beaten by someone who takes advantage of that
   handicap.  Another is the wrongness of taking advantage of a person's
   inability to function as a person, either because he is not now capable of
   doing so, or no longer capable, or not yet capable.  This is perfectly parallel
   to the injustice of taking advantage of a person's physical inabilities.
   Persons are persons, they have the dignity of a person, whether they have
   these abilities or not.  To take advantage of a person's inabilities is to
   affront his dignity.  It is an antithesis to the reverence due to his dignity
   as a person.<P>

        It is wrong to kill a child in the womb, or a newborn baby, on the
   grounds that he has not yet reached a sufficient degree of functioning as
   a person.  The same applies to a severely retarded child who probably
   never will achieve a certain normal level of functioning as a person.  He has
   the same human nature, he is equally a person, he has the same dignity
   as a person fortunate enough to be normal.  As always, it is his being as
   a person that counts, not his capabilities for functioning as a person.<P>

        It is the achievement view that constitutes the principal denial of
   this.  In one case (the normal child), it denies his personhood, his dignity,
   because he has not yet achieved the required level of functioning as a person.  
In another case (the severely retarded child), it denies his personhood, his 
dignity, because he will never achieve the required level of
   functioning.  But who says he must?  Nobody has the right to set such
   standards, and impose them on others, especially at the price of their
   lives.<P>

        The normal person deserves our reverence, our respect for his
   dignity, not because he is normal, not because of actual or potential
   achievements in functioning as a person, but simply because he is a
   person.  And the non-normal person is equally a person, and deserves
   equal reverence.  If you were to become a victim of a disease or accident
   that left you severely retarded, incapacitated, you would want your
   dignity respected just as before.  You would still be yourself, the same
   person, hence a person, hence a being with the dignity of a person.  Exactly
   the same applies to the severely retarded child, and to the preborn child,
   who is in many respects similar in his capabilities.<P>

        Reverence is the most fundamental response due to another person
   in his dignity; it is not the whole of it.  Love is the fulfillment and the highest
   form of this response.  Each in its own way is an antithesis to using a
   person as a mere means, as in rape, enslavement, and other ways, and
   to the attitude of "get rid of it" so often displayed in the context of abortion.
   Each is also an antithesis to the achievement view and its odious
   discrimination between those who have achieved, and therefore count,
   and those who have not achieved, and therefore don't count, and thus
   may be destroyed.<P>

        The reality of love as the deepest response to another in his dignity
   manifests itself in the attitude and work of Mother Theresa of Calcutta.
   The story is told of a man whom she found abandoned in the gutter of a
   street.  She picked him up, brought him to her home, cared for him in love
   for the few remaining days (or hours) of his life.  He responded by saying,
   "I have lived like an animal in the street, but I will die like an angel, loved
   and cared for."<SUP><A HREF=notes7.htm#54>54</A></SUP><P>

	A Woman's Right over her Body?
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

Does a woman's right over her body give her the right to have an abortion?
  "After all, it is my body.  Do I not have a right to control it?  A right to
  determine what happens in it?  Do I not have a right to reproductive
  freedom, to decide whether or not, or when, to become a mother?  I may
  even grant that the fetus is a person, a small child.  If there is a child in
  my body, and I do not want him there, do I not have the right to remove
  him?  If he stays in me, he draws his sustenance from me.  Does he have
  a right to do this?  Do I have a duty to sustain him?  Can I not expel him
  from my womb?  Is this not what an abortion amounts to?  If I perceive him
  as an intruder, can I not expel him?  If he is a threat to my life or well-being,
  can I not defend myself by expelling him?  In short, I have a right over my
  body, and if I have an unwanted pregnancy, I can terminate it by having
  an abortion."<P>

       There are three distinct claims here. (1) A woman has no duty to
  sustain the child; (2) she may expel the child as an intruder; and (3) she
  may defend herself against him if he is a threat to her life or well-being.
  The first two claims pertain directly to the general thesis that a woman has
  a right to an abortion because she has a right over her body.  I will examine
  these two claims in turn.  The third claim is more specific.  Since it is
  limited to cases of threats to the life or well-being of the woman, it cannot
  be used as a ground for the general claim to a right to abortion based on
  a right over one's body.  It belongs in the context of the question of abortion
  for the life of the woman, which I will pursue in chapter 10.<P>

	"No Duty to Sustain" Argument
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

The core of this argument is the claim that the woman has no duty to
  sustain the life of the child.  Abortion is the exercise of the right to
  withdraw the support that the child is not entitled to. "This argument has
  been proposed by Judith Jarvis Thomson<SUP><A HREF=notes8.htm#1>1</A></SUP> and Martha Brandt Bolton.<SUP><A HREF=notes8.htm#2>2</A></SUP>
  Bolton argues for the right to abortion, and against the view that abortion
  is immoral:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         To see the incoherence in the anti-abortionists' argument, we need to
         look at the gaps in their account of what is at stake in an abortion.
         They emphasize the fetus's alleged right to life.  They do not emphasize
         a matter that is equally important.  This is that if a pregnant woman
         is obligated not to kill a fetus, then she is obligated to do a great deal
         more than that.  She can meet the alleged obligation not to kill only if
         she takes on the various obligations involved in bearing and having a
         child.  At the least, she must nurture the fetus, carry it to term, and
         give it birth; she must then care for the infant or make alternative
         arrangements for its care . . .
               It is relatively easy to live without deliberately killing someone;
         but it may require an indefinitely large commitment of time, energy,
         emotion, and physical resources to nurture and care for a child.<SUP><A HREF=notes8.htm#3>3</A></SUP>
<P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

        Thomson argues in the same way.  She asks us to imagine the
  following case.  You wake up one morning and find that another person,
  a famous violinist, is "plugged in" to you so that he can stay alive.  You are
  attached to him, thereby sustaining his life.  You did not agree to this: it
  was forced on you.  But if you unplug yourself from him, he will die.  It
  would not be proper to argue, Thomson says, in the following way: "All
  persons have a right to life, this violinist is a person, therefore he has a
  right to life, and so you may not detach yourself from him." You have no
  duty to sustain him, and therefore you may detach yourself from him.  You
  have the right to do this; the violinist has no right to be sustained by you.<P>

        Most arguments for abortion try to show that the fetus is not a
  person, at least not in the same sense as a born person.  In contrast,
  Thomson proposes "that we grant that the fetus is a person from the
  moment of conception."<SUP><A HREF=notes8.htm#4>4</A></SUP> She then tries to show that abortion is justified
  nonetheless by appealing to the analogy between being pregnant and
  having a violinist plugged into you.  Being pregnant means the child is
  plugged into the woman, his life sustained by her.  Thomson's basic
  argument is that, just as anyone may detach himself from the violinist,
  so too the woman may detach herself from the child.  Abortion is such a
  detachment.<P>

       In refuting the "no duty to sustain argument," I shall focus on
 Thomson's formulation of it, and I shall assume, for the sake of argument,
 that Thomson is correct when she holds, as one of her basic premises, that
 the person plugged into the violinist has no duty to sustain him, but may
 indeed unplug herself from him. (That might be questioned too, but I
 shall not enter upon it here.) I want to argue that the two cases - the
 violinist plugged into the person and the child plugged into his mother -
 are radically and essentially different, that the alleged parallel does not
 hold; and this for three different reasons.<P>

<A NAME=First></A><EM> The First Refutation of This Argument</EM><P>

 There are times when we may detach ourselves from another person, even
 though this results in his death.  So far, Thomson has a valid point.
 Imagine a lifeguard trying to breathe life into a swimmer struggling
 between life and death.  He does this for a long time, but the victim does
 not respond, nor does he die.  He remains on the edge.  At some point the
 lifeguard gives up - he cannot continue indefinitely.  And the victim dies.
 Suppose that the lifeguard kept up his efforts for a reasonable length of
 time, and that he is then more justified in giving up.  Suppose also that
 his efforts sustained the victim's life, though he was just barely alive.
 When we say that the lifeguard was morally justified in giving up, we are
 saying that, at that point, he did not have (i.e.. no longer had) a duty to
 sustain the life of the victim.  It was morally right for him to withhold his
 support.<P>

       So too, it would be right, at least under most conditions, for Thomson
 to unplug herself from the violinist: she may withhold her support for his
 life, she need not sustain him.  She may sever the link and thus act to
 withhold life support.<P>

       Thomson may withhold support from the violinist, and the lifeguard
 may withhold support from the drowning victim.  They may withhold life
 sustaining measures - they may not kill the other person.  This is the
 crucial distinction here. Thomson's argument tries to justify abortion as
 an act of withholding support.  But it is also primarily an act of killing.  So,
 even if it were justified under the heading of "withholding," it is not
 justified because it also falls under the heading of "killing."<P>

       <EM>Killing</EM> refers to actions where (A) the intention is the death of another
 person, or (B) the intention is something else, but what is actually done
 is in fact killing. Thus, (A) a killer shoots someone out of hatred because
 he wants him dead.  Or (B), imagine that you are trapped in a cave
 because someone is stuck in the entrance of the cave.<SUP><A HREF=notes8.htm#5>5</A></SUP> (He is there
 through no fault of his own, and he is not about to die.) You have some
 dynamite.  If you blow him up so that you can get out, you may be said to
 intend his removal rather than his death, but the act of dynamiting him
 is of course killing, and murder.  Thus killing, the deliberate bringing
 about of the death of an innocent person occurs, (A) when the agent acts
 because he wants the person dead, or (B) when it is something else he
 wants, which is obtained by an action that is in fact killing.<P>

      For <EM>withholding</EM>, as the term is used here, two conditions are
 necessary.  The first refers to the intention: it can only be not to sustain,
 or not save the other person; it cannot be to cause her death.  The lifeguard
 withholds support because he is exhausted, not because he wants the
 person dead.  To withhold support because you want the person dead does
 not fall under withholding as understood here.<P>

      The second necessary condition refers to the mode of implementation.  Withholding can obviously take the form of an omission, as when the
 lifeguard ceases further support for the drowning victim: or you do not
 give a lifesaving medication to one person because you have decided to
 give it to another who needs it just as much.  It can also take the form of
 an action, as when Thomson cuts the link connecting her to the violinist.
 But that action can only be the cutting of the link or something essentially
 similar.  It cannot be an action that is in fact killing, even though the
 intention is only the severing of a link, i.e., the cessation of support.  Thus
 if the withholding takes the form of an action, it cannot be an action that
 is in fact killing.<P>

      This is where Thomson's argument for abortion clearly fails.  Assume
 that the woman has no duty to sustain the child.  This means only that
 she has the right to withhold her support from him.  It does not give her
 the right to kill the child, which is what abortion is.  If Thomson's
 argument seems to have a plausibility, it is because it views abortion only
 as an act of withholding support.  But this is to overlook what abortion
 really is: killing the child, by dismembering him or poisoning-burning.
 Thomson seizes on the withholding of support aspect of abortion,
 suppressing the deliberate killing aspect.  The fact that an act may be right
 when viewed under one description does not mean that the act itself is
 right.  For example, to describe an act as driving one's car on a public
 street is to offer a description of it, under which it is perfectly all right.  But
 if, in a particular case, that act includes running over a group of children
 who are playing there, then the act is quite obviously not right.  What is
 clear from this example is that the latter description completely overrides
 the former one.  Thus the act is clearly wrong because it is an act of killing,
 even if someone manages to find a description of it under which it is right.
 So, too, abortion is clearly wrong, even if Thomson manages to find a
 description of it under which it is, or might be, right.<P>

        Put another way, even if the child does not have the positive right to
   receive sustenance from her mother, she still has the negative right not
   to be killed.  A beggar may not have the positive right to be fed and housed
   by me; I may withhold that.  But he surely has the negative right not to be
   murdered by me. The same applies to the child.<P>

        "But," Thomson might argue, "if the only way I can exercise my right
   to withhold support for the child within me is by removing him, may I not
   do so?  Even if this causes his death?"

<P>        Consider a parallel case.  I find a stranger in my house.  He will die
   unless I take care of him.  Assume I have no duty to do this, that I may
   rightly withhold support.  Then I may do just that.  I cannot throw him out
   if this means throwing him off a cliff or into a pond where he will drown.
   That I throw him out in the name of withholding support does not mean
   that I don't also do something else: kill him. That the woman "throws the
   child out" in the name of withholding support does not mean that she does
   not also do something else: kill him.  In both cases, the fact that the act
   is one of killing (murder) makes it wrong, the other description (withholding support) notwithstanding.
       
<P> Quite generally, if I can exercise a right I have, such as the right to
   drive my car, to remove an impediment from the mouth of a cave where
   I'm trapped, to free myself from another person with whom I'm involved,
   if I can exercise such a right only by killing an innocent person, I may not
   do so.
       
<P> Specifically, if the only way I can exercise my right to withhold
   support is to kill another person, I may not do it.  My duty not to kill an
   innocent person takes precedence over the exercise of my right to
   withhold support.
       
<P> Therefore, the "no duty to sustain" argument fails. The wrongness of
   abortion is that it is the deliberate killing of a person, even if the intention
   is the withholding of support.  The woman's duty not to destroy the child,
   not to murder him, takes absolute precedence over any right she may
   have to withhold support.


<A NAME=Second></A>   <P><EM>The Second Refutation of This Argument</EM><P>

   The alleged parallel between the person plugged into the violinist and the
   woman with child fails in a second, also very significant, way.<SUP><A HREF=notes8.htm#6>6</A></SUP> To see this
   let us put Thomson's argument aside for a moment and look at something
   else.  We all recognize the obligation of parents to take care of their
   children: to provide shelter and protection, to feed them, to clothe them,
   to love them, and support them emotionally.  They have this obligation
   even when it costs them a great deal of effort and sacrifice, when it places
 great burdens on them. The reality and significance of this obligation
 becomes clear when considering its denial: child neglect.

<P>       The parents of a particular child have this obligation to him, and not
 someone else, because they are his biological parents, because they, and
 not someone else, begot and conceived the child.  It is the biological bond
 that creates the obligation of parents to take care of their children, and
 also the rights that accompany this obligation.
       
<P>This obligation came into existence at conception-fertilization, when
 the event that grounds the obligation occurred.  In begetting and conceiving the child, the parents brought him into existence; they also brought
 into existence, by the same act, their obligation to nourish and protect
 him.
       
<P>Parents have rights over their child, which other persons do not
 have; for example, the right to discipline him.  Rights and duties with
 regard to children go hand in hand.  Parents have these rights because
 they first have the duties.
       
<P>Both the rights and the duties of natural parents toward their
 children come clearly into focus when the process of adoption is
 considered.  Adoption is a legal transfer of rights and obligations to a new
 party.  Only the natural mother can do this (or possibly the father).  And
 she can do this because she is the mother.  One can only give over what
 one already has.  What is given over in the adoption process is precisely
 the relationship of obligations to the child (and the rights corresponding
 to them) stemming from the fact of conceiving the child.  The woman can
 give her child up for adoption because it is her child: her responsibility
 to sustain.
       
<P>Thomson's "violinist argument" fails because the two cases are not
 parallel.  The person hooked up to the violinist (we are assuming) has no
 duty to sustain him, for he is a total stranger, standing in a relation to the
 person that is most unnatural. This is exactly the opposite of the mother- child relation, which is most natural and proper.  We do not have the
 obligation to sustain strangers artificially hooked up to us, but we do have
 the obligation to sustain our own children.  So, the very thing that makes
 it plausible to say that the person in bed with the violinist has no duty to
 sustain him; namely, that he is a stranger unnaturally hooked up to him,
 is precisely what is absent in the case of the mother and her child.  She
 does have an obligation to take care of her child, to sustain her, to protect
 her, and especially, to let her live in the only place where she can now be
 protected, nourished, and allowed to grow, namely the womb.  If she ejects
 her from her womb, it is like a mother throwing her child out of her home,
 into the cold, refusing to take care of her.  The preborn child must be
 viewed, and treated, just like the born child; even Thomson admits as
 much when she structures her argument on the assumption "that the
 fetus is a person from the moment of conception."
      
<P>If the mother has the duty to sustain the child, she may not "unplug"
 herself from him.  Therefore, abortion merely as unplugging is morally
 wrong.  So the "no duty to sustain" argument is false at its very core: the
 woman does have a duty to sustain her child, because it is her child. The
 person plugged into the violinist does not, correspondingly, have the duty
 to sustain him, for he is not his.
      
<P>Suppose the woman has been raped.  She still has a duty to sustain
 the life of the child.  Despite the absolute horror of rape, the terrible
 injustice and violence of this most despicable act, the reality of the
 child must be kept in mind; he is absolutely innocent.  The father is
 guilty of a terrible crime; the child is not.  The child conceived in rape
 is a reminder to the woman of the horrible event that led to the child's
 coming into being.  That is certainly a powerful psychological reality. It
 does not mean that the child partakes of the moral evil of this event.  The
 child is real, and innocent, and she has the same preciousness and
 dignity as the rest of us, and the same right to life.  That is, the same right
 not to be killed, and also, the same right to be sustained.  She is still
 the child of her mother.  What was noted above, that a parent has the
 obligation to take care of her own child, because she is her child, is
 something quite universal.  It applies to all parents and children.  It does
 not cease to be true because the act of intercourse that led to the
 conception of the child was violent and forced upon the woman. The
 biological relation of mother to child is still there, unaffected by the
 circumstance of the rape.
      
<P>It is interesting to note that Thomson herself does not press the rape
 argument for abortion in this context.  She says, "Surely the question
 whether you have a right to life at all, or how much of it you have, shouldn't
 [doesn't?] turn on the question of whether or not you are the product of
 a rape."<SUP><A HREF=notes8.htm#7>7</A></SUP> Excellent point!

<P> Defenders of abortion, agreeing that killing an innocent person is wrong,
 argue that the case of abortion is different.  According to Bolton, "It is
 relatively easy to live without deliberately killing someone; but it may
 require an indefinitely large commitment of time, energy, emotion, and
 physical resources to nurture and care for a child."
      
<P>Is it really evident (as Bolton's argument seems to assume) that
 when such a commitment is necessary for the life of one person, the
  other person is released from the obligation to make it?  And that she
  may exercise this option by killing the dependent person?
       
<P>The relation between woman and child is a relation of two persons,
  A and B, where B is dependent on A for his sustenance and protection.
  The pro-abortion claim in Bolton's argument can be tested by reversing
  the roles.  Suppose the woman, B, were dependent on another person, A.
  for her sustenance and protection.  Would it be right for A to kill the woman
  in order to exercise his option of not sustaining her?  Clearly not.
  Defenders of abortion, who appeal to the special relation between woman
  and child, would certainly not defend the right of A to kill B when B is the
  woman.  It is no different when A is the woman and B is the child.
       
<P>Another aspect of this relation is that A has absolute power over B,
  the power to destroy B. Abortion is the exercise of this power.  To see the
  wrongness of abortion, let us again imagine the roles reversed, with the
  woman in the position of B, at the mercy of some person A who has the
  power to destroy her.  Those who advocate a right to terminate the child
  by abortion because she is dependent upon, and at the mercy of the
  woman and her doctor, would be horrified if someone advocated a right
  to terminate the woman because she was dependent upon, and at the
  mercy of others.  The child is a victim because she is helpless, because
  people do not identify with her as a real person.
       
<P>There is indeed a special relation between woman and child: the
  child is entrusted to her, as she was entrusted to her mother when she
  was a child in the womb.  The "no duty to sustain" argument arises out of
  a denial of this deep relationship of being entrusted, or a refusal to
  accept it.
       
<P>The claim to a right over one's body (as a slogan for abortion) is not
  a genuine claim to a right, as when a member of one group of persons
  claims the same rights as the members of another group.  It is rather a
  refusal to acknowledge the relationship of being entrusted.  It is the
  expression of a determination to live one's own life even at the expense of
  utterly crushing that of another.
       
<P>Abortion is a double evil: the killing of a helpless small child, in a
  most cruel way; and the denial of the special, profound relationship of
  entrustment.  The woman who has an abortion destroys a child who is
  especially entrusted to her.


<A NAME=Third></A>  <P><EM>The Third Refutation of This Argument</EM>

<P>  Assume that being tied to the violinist represents only a light burden.
  The case for abortion based on this analogy is then significantly
  weakened if not destroyed altogether.  Thomson herself admits as
  much:

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>         Suppose you learn that what the violinist needs is only one hour: all
         you need do to save his life is to spend one hour in that bed with him.
         Suppose also that letting him use your kidneys for that one hour
         would not affect your health in the slightest.  Admittedly you were
         kidnapped.  Admittedly you did not give anyone permission to plug
         him in to you. Nevertheless it seems to me plain you <EM>ought</EM> to allow him
         to use your kidneys for that hour - it would be indecent to refuse.<SUP><A HREF=notes8.htm#8>8</A></SUP><P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

       <P>Assume then that being tied to the violinist represents an extreme
  hardship and burden, in order to give Thomson one fairly strong premise:
  since having the violinist plugged into you represents an extreme burden
  and hardship for you, you may unplug yourself from him.  But the very
  strength of this premise is also the collapse of the argument for abortion
  based on it.  For that argument (if otherwise successful) would justify
  abortions only when they represented an extreme hardship for the
  woman.  If it is the extreme hardship that constitutes the justification for
  severing the link, then of course the absence of such an extreme hardship
  would mean that severing the link is wrong; hence that abortion as the
  severing of this link is wrong.  What defenders of abortion want of course
  is a general, universal right to an abortion, especially when they stress a
  woman's right over her body. Thus the analogy to the violinist, when the
  connection to him represents an extreme hardship, will simply not
  provide.  Hence the argument fails.
       
<P>This refutation of Thomson does not, like the previous refutation,
  appeal to the special obligation of a mother to sustain her child.  It is quite
  general.  Except in cases of extreme hardships or sufferings, we do have
  the obligation to not let others die, hence to sustain them if they need our
  help.  This applies to strangers as well as our own family and friends.  If I
  see a person dying in the wilderness, I have a duty to try to save her, and
  not leave her to die.  I have this duty even if it represents a considerable
  sacrifice for me.  I am released from it only if it represents an extreme
  hardship or suffering such as permanent paralysis or blindness.  How
  severe the hardship or suffering must be before I am released from my
  general obligation to save the life of another is hard to say., One rule that
  one might follow is to put oneself in the position of the victim, and ask how
  much of a burden one could reasonably expect from another to save one's
  life.  "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."
       
<P>Thus even if we prescind from the specific obligation of a mother to
  care for her own child, there is the very important general obligation we
  all have to each other, to sustain one another when in need.  A woman
 would have the duty to sustain the child even if she were a stranger,
 unless it were an extreme hardship or burden, one which very few
 pregnancies involve.  Even then, she would have only the right to not
 sustain, not the right to kill.

	"Child as Intruder" Argument
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

<P> The second claim for a right to an abortion based on a woman's right over
 her body concerns the child as an intruder.  Thomson argues that the
 child is an intruder in the woman's body, like a burglar in one's home, or
 an innocent person who blunders in.<SUP><A HREF=notes8.htm#9>9</A></SUP> Just as the owner of the home has
 the right to remove the intruder, even if she is partly responsible for his
 getting in, so too a woman has the right to remove the child from her body
 even if she is partly responsible for his getting in: voluntary sexual
 intercourse with contraceptive failure.  Let me offer two replies to this
 argument.
      
<P>First, the child is not an intruder.  He is precisely where he should be,
 in the place appropriate to the first phase of his life. That an argument
 comparing a woman's own child to a burglar or other intruder is even put
 forward is significant for what it reveals about the mentality of its
 proponents.  That a woman looks upon her own child as a burglar or an
 intruder is already an evil, even if she then refrains from killing her.
 Imagine the mother of a born child looking upon her as an intruder in her
 house, being in the way, restricting her freedom.  We would perceive this
 as a terrible selfishness.  It is the same thing when the child is smaller, and
 in "her house" in another, more intimate sense, her own body.
      
<P>What is forgotten in this mentality is the great gift and privilege of
 being a mother, the gift of being allowed to nurture a new human person.
 Also forgotten is the deep responsibility we have to each other, as
 members of the human community.  This applies not only to helping a
 neighbor in need, and other obligations we have to born persons; it also
 involves our obligation to our own children.  The woman who now looks
 upon her child, in her own womb, as an intruder, was once herself such
 a child in the womb.  She would not have wanted to be looked upon as an
 intruder by her mother.  "Do unto others as you would have them do unto
 you."

<P>      The woman has the right to be on this earth, in a place appropriate
 for her.  In exactly the same way, the child in her womb has the right to
 be on this earth, in a place appropriate for her, for her protection,
 nourishment and development.  So, contrary to Thomson, the child does
   have a right to be in the womb, as Thomson herself had this right when
   she was in the preborn stage of her existence.  Thus the analogy to a
   burglar, or stumbling intruder, breaks down; and with it any argument
   that tries to justify expelling the child from the womb as if she were an
   intruder.<SUP><A HREF=notes8.htm#10>10</A></SUP>
       
<P> Second, even if the child were an intruder, that would justify only her
   removal from the woman, not killing her.  As already noted, I cannot throw
   an intruder out if this means killing him by throwing him off a cliff.  And
   that is of course what abortion is: killing the child.  Abortion is wrong
   because it is so much more than a mere removal. It means cutting the
   child to pieces, burning her skin, etc.  Who would do such a thing to a born
   person who was an intruder?
       
<P> Similar to the "intruder" argument, it is sometimes said that the
   relation of child to woman is parasitic: the child is a parasite living off the
   body of the woman.<SUP><A HREF=notes8.htm#11>11</A></SUP> This is a total distortion of the real relation between
   the child and her mother.  A parasite is essentially an alien being; the child
   is clearly not an alien, but the mother's own child, whom she conceived,
   her own flesh and blood.  A parasite can be understood as a being who
   should not be there; the child, in contrast, is in her proper place, exactly
   where she should be.  A baby kangaroo is surely not a parasite when she
   is in her mother's pouch; a human infant in the womb is no different.  A
   child at her mother's breast takes her nourishment from her, as does a
   parasite, but this relationship can hardly be called parasitic.  The child in
   the womb is very much like the child at her mother's breast.  The
   relationship is then less close, since the child is then more independent,
   but in both cases, the child is properly related to her mother, i.e., just
   the opposite of a parasite.

	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

<P>   If there is a right over one's body then two very significant features pertain
   to it.  One, it is a right everyone has; and two, it includes the right not to
   have one's body destroyed (e.g., by dismemberment), the right not to be
   killed. On both these counts, the appeal to a woman's right over her body
   as a justification for abortion backfires, and provides an argument
   against abortion. Thus if a woman has a right over her body, then the child
   has that right too.  "For after all the <EM>child's body is the child's body, not
   the woman's.... </EM>The child, like his mother, has a 'just prior claim to his
   own body,' and abortion involves laying hands on, manipulating, that
   body."<SUP><A HREF=notes8.htm#12>12</A></SUP>

 <P><A NAME=Summary></A><EM>Summary</EM>

<P> I have argued that a woman's right over her body does not justify the claim
 to a right to abortion.  The major argument for this claim is the "no duty
 to sustain" argument.  That argument fails on three counts:
      
<OL><LI>Abortion is not a mere withholding of support, not a mere "unplugging," but a deliberate killing, even if the intention is the withholding of
 support.<P>

<LI>The woman is not justified in withholding support from the child.
      The child is her own, entrusted to her, and so she has the obligation to
 take care of her.  Failure to do so is child neglect.  Hence "unplugging" is
 wrong already on the level of intending to withhold support.<P>

<LI>The woman is not justified in withholding support from the child,
 even if the child were not her own, but a stranger.  For we have a general
 obligation to save others' lives, to sustain them if they need us to live,
 unless this represents an extreme hardship.<P>

<LI>The child as an intruder argument (with the analogy to a burglar)
 fails because the child is not an intruder, but in her natural place.  Even
 if she were an intruder, she could not be ejected by being killed.<P>

<LI>The argument of the right over one's body proves the wrongness
 of abortion: the child has the right not to have her body destroyed.

"There are no simple answers to the agonizing, complex issue of abortion."
    How many times have you heard that?  Most people take for granted the
    complexity of abortion.  And in some sense (to be explained shortly) it
    really is complex.  But in another sense it is not complex at all.  Abortion,
    on the deepest moral level, is painfully, brutally simple.  Study these
    pictures.  Consider what abortion did to these children, what it does to any
    children.

Some readers may object to the inclusion of the gruesome pictures that
    follow.  The theme of this chapter is the true nature of abortion.  If these
    pictures help us understand what this is, and to respond accordingly,
    then they will have served their purpose.  If it is painful to look at them,
    then we will have participated, in a small way, in the pain that an abortion
    is. If we find them sickening, if we are outraged, this is because abortion
    is truly sickening, a terrible outrage, a horror.

<P>         These pictures are presented so that we may face the reality of what
    an abortion is, what it does to the child.  What is gruesome is not each
    picture, but the reality it conveys: abortion itself is gruesome and
    horrifying.

<P>         Many people support the right of a woman to choose abortion
    without realizing what this really means.  The pictures tell us.  Many
    people are indifferent to abortion.  Others are opposed but not outraged.
    If these pictures shake our complacency, they will have served a good
    purpose.

<P>

<P>Some may object that showing these pictures is an appeal to
   emotion.  Indeed it is.  When we show pictures of the results of the Nazi
   Holocaust while exclaiming "Never again!" we are appealing to emotion.
   When we argue for a policy aimed at reducing the horror of mass
   starvation, and include pictures of starving people, we are appealing to
   emotion.  And rightly so.  We grasp truths not only with our intellects but
   with our hearts as well.  And we should respond not only with our minds
   and our wills, but with our hearts as well.  This applies to many things,
   including truths about massive horrors.  What we should avoid are false
   appeals to emotion, and emotional appeals offered instead of reasons.
   These pictures parallel the arguments of this book that abortion kills a
   real human person; they are as true as those arguments, and supplement
   them.
       
<P>Part of the message of these pictures is this: before you decide your
   position on abortion, know what abortion does! If you decide to support
   the pro-choice position, you should know that this is what you are in favor
   of allowing women to choose, and doctors to execute.
       
<P> Even if abortion were neat and clean, quick and painless, it would
   still be a horror, for any killing of an innocent human being is a horror.
   The ghastly methods depicted in these pictures add to the horror; and
   contemplating the results of abortions helps us to grasp the horror of any
   abortion.


   
<P><A NAME=Actions></A><EM>Judging Actions and Judging Persons</EM>


<P>   The theme of this chapter is the true nature of abortion as a moral horror.
   In addressing this, I am concerned only with judging the action of
   abortion, not with judging the persons involved in it. The question is, what
   kind of an action is abortion?  Not, are abortionists and women who
   choose abortion guilty?  The whole question of personal guilt lies outside
   the scope of this book, and varies from case to case.
       
<P> Evidence indicates that in many cases women are the second victims
   of abortion.<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#1>1</A></SUP> In one sense they choose, but in a deeper and more
   significant sense, they succumb, because they see no realistic alternative.
   They feel coerced, their situation presents itself to them as leaving no
   other choice, they experience an absence of choice.  Women can be victims
   of abortion in other ways.  For example, the horror they experience when
   they realize what it means to have had their own child killed.<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#2>2</A></SUP>

	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

The pictures tell us what abortion does to an individual child.  Another
   dimension of the horror of abortion is that this is happening on a mass
   scale, about 1.6 million per year in the United States, many millions more
   worldwide.  That 1.6 million means well over 4,000 each day, or about one
   every 10 seconds.

<P>        The most apt description of the killing of innocent persons on such
   a mass scale is that of William Brennan, in <EM>The Abortion Holocaust:
   Today's Final Solution</EM>.<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#3>3</A></SUP> He notes many striking similarities between the
   massive killing of unwanted persons in Nazi Germany and unwanted
   persons today.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        Atrocities Past and Present<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>

        In the Eastern territories special killing units ... followed upon the
        heels of the German Army in a systematic search-and-destroy mission
        bent on eradicating Jews, Gypsies, the insane, and the handicapped.
        The victims were shot in cold blood in front of huge ditches.  Their
        bodies toppled into the gaping holes of massive graves.  Many expired
        from their wounds.  Others were buried alive and suffocated to death.

<P>              Vacuum aspiration abortion, the most common method of destroying unborn children in the first trimester of pregnancy, is an
        especially brutal procedure.  The child's tiny body - including arms,
      legs, head, and torso - is torn away from the walls of the uterus, ripped
      apart, and reduced to smithereens by the force of a suction machine
      many times more powerful than a vacuum cleaner.  Little wonder that
      some nurses have referred to the aspirator as "the murder machine."
      The obliterated remains are sucked out of the womb through a
      transparent tube into a collecting bottle.  They are examined and then
      incinerated or flushed into the sewer....
       
<P>    Destruction inside the gas chambers of concentration camps
      was a painful and extended process in which the victims desperately
      gasped for breath and life. The hardiest inmates sometimes trampled
      upon women, children, and the elderly in their futile efforts to escape
      the deadly fumes.  Body-disposal squads developed special hook-tipped poles," thrust deep into the flesh of the newly exterminated, to
      facilitate the task of removing entangled, bloated, and deformed
      corpses with blood oozing from their noses and mouths.
       
<P>    A prime example of contemporary scientific butchery, D & E
      (dilation and extraction) abortion, involves the use of curettes to
      mutilate victims beyond the first trimester of pregnancy, and forceps
      to extract their slaughtered remains from the womb piece by piece.
      "The sensations of dismemberment," according to veteran D & E
      abortionist Dr. Warren M. Hern, "flow through the forceps like an
      electric current." The solid, well-formed heads of the victims must
      frequently be crushed before removal.  Then the butchered body parts
      are assembled to ensure that the uterus has been completely emptied.
       
<P>    During the height of the killing season at Auchwitz living
      children were tossed directly into the fires of crematorium furnaces or
      flaming pits.  Their screams could be heard throughout the camp
      compound....
       
<P>    The injection of concentrated salt solutions into the amniotic
      fluid surrounding the unborn child is another example of the sheer
      barbarism with which human lives are done away with in the mid-trimester of gestation.  The corrosive saline often bums away the outer
      layer of skin, exposing the raw, red under-surface.  The effect is similar
      to that of napalm on innocent war victims.  For the victims the dying
      process is agonizing and prolonged, lasting from one to several
      hours....
       
<P>    During the 12 years of the Third Reich the holocaust consumed
      some 6 million Jews, 5 million non-Jews, 275,000 handicapped
      Germans in euthanasia hospitals, a quarter of a million Gypsies, and
      countless numbers of unborn expendables.
       
<P>    Since the 1973 Supreme Court decision which sanctified abortion on demand, well over 10 million [now 20 million] unborn lives
      have been extinguished by heinous acts of medical extermination not
      even legally permitted against animals, birds, or fish.  The uterus,
      which once had been a private sanctuary exquisitely suited for growth
      and development, has been transformed into a deadly environment
             polluted beyond belief by the invasion of lethal instruments and
             poisonous substances that defy the most fundamental laws of ecology
             and humanity!<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#4>4</A></SUP>

<P></FONT>

             Goals<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>

             The goals of both concentration camps and abortion clinics are
             identical: the destruction of unwanted human lives.

<P>                   Concentration camps specialized in exterminating Jews, Gypsies, Poles, asocials, and the unborn children of female slave laborers.

<P>                   Abortion clinics are devoted to the task of destroying unborn
             children in the first trimester of pregnancy.  Many abortoriums have
             even expanded their destructive operations to consume victims in the
             later stages of pregnancy.<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#5>5</A></SUP>

<P></FONT>
             Psychic Numbing<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>

             This involves a loss of capacity to feel on the part of the perpetrator and
             a pervasive brutalization. "What happens is that the aggressor cuts
             the other person off emotionally, and 'freezes' him," concluded Erich
             Fromm.  "The other person ceases to be experienced as human, and
             becomes a 'thing - over there.'"<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#6>6</A></SUP>

<P></FONT>
             Non-Visibility of the Victims<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>

             Bureaucratic destruction works best when the technology employed
             keeps the victims out of sight.  If they can be rendered nonvisible, a
             claim can be made that they do not exist. This in turn eliminates the
             emotionally-repulsive elements associated with killing visible victims
             and helps reduce destruction to the trivial level of a technical
             procedure.

         This is a perversion of the first order because it exploits the language
         of rights as a pretext for taking away the most fundamental right of all:
         the right to life.  It is an arrogant, elitist assumption of the awesome
         power to destroy those who cannot defend themselves, an extreme
         manifestation of the strong victimizing the helpless.  The catch words
         "selection" and "choice" represent a blatant sham because the individuals most drastically affected, the victims, are the very ones who
         are denied the right to choose.  Someone else determines their fate -
         death by someone else's selection.  This is not freedom, but the worst
         kind of oppression!<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#10>10</A></SUP>

<P>Given that abortion is a horror, why is it tolerated in a civilized society?
   We "accept something as ghastly as the dismemberment of babies
   identical in size to preemies"<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#11>11</A></SUP> because we do not perceive it as a horror.
   Instead, we perceive it as a complex issue. This lack of perception (and its
   replacement by the "complex issue" approach) has many sources, They
   include:

<P><OL><LI><EM>Lack of awareness</EM>.  Many people do not realize, fully and clearly,
   that the being in the womb is a small person; that at seven weeks (before
   most abortions), she is a well proportioned small-scale baby.  Some are
   aware of the reality of the child for the later stages of pregnancy but
   unclear about the earlier stages, and the precise beginning of a person's
   existence at conception.  "Perhaps it is just a 'cluster of cells' then." They
   feel uncertain as to when it becomes a real person.  So it becomes a
   complex issue, one with no clear or definite right answer.  This effectively
   closes the door to perceiving abortion as the horror that it is.

<P>         Most people are unaware of the methods, such as dismemberment.
   Most do not realize what a saline does to the child.  Someone has said that
   "if the media were to show aborted children every evening for two weeks,
   legal abortion would be finished."<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#12>12</A></SUP>
       
<P><LI><EM>The veil of language</EM>.  Abortion is called a woman's choice; it is
   defended as an example of reproductive rights.  These high-sounding
   terms obscure the ghastly reality of abortion as the destruction of a
   helpless child.  No one wants to be against a woman's right to choose.  It
   is impossible to see something both as an expression of someone's right
   and also as a horror.  The language of rights and choice effectively
   obscures the reality of abortion as killing.  "It can't be a killing if a woman
   has a right to choose it." And so it is the "termination of pregnancy,"
   another example of the veil of language.

<P>
<LI><EM>Sympathy for women</EM>. Many women say they need abortions, want
 them, have had them.  It is difficult to have sympathy for the person, and
 at the same time recognize the action she is involved in as a moral horror.
 The result is that sympathy for the woman has the effect of obscuring
 one's vision of the horror of the action.

<P><LI><EM>Single aspect approach</EM>. A person may be gripped by one aspect of
 the abortion question, especially women's rights.  If this is seen as the all-important issue, then anything else that is viewed as interfering with it
 becomes obscured, even denied.  It seems that one first decides that the
 right to abortion is necessary, and then concludes that abortion can't be
 wrong, and can't be a horror.  From this stems the notion that the fetus
 is not a real child.  "He can't be, else we could not have him killed." Being
 emotionally gripped leads to rationalization, which leads to blindness.

<P><LI><EM>The division of opinion</EM>. People are divided over whether abortion
 is right or wrong, including questions about exceptions.  So, abortion is
 seen as controversial.  "If it is controversial, it must be complex; there are
 no easy answers." It is impossible to say this and also to recognize the
 horror of abortion, of each abortion for the individual child, and of mass
 abortion as a holocaust.  And so the perceived complexity of abortion
 makes it impossible to perceive its true nature as a horror.

<P><LI><EM>Exceptions</EM>.  Even many people who are strongly opposed to abortion allow for, or seriously consider, certain exceptions, such as rape and
 incest.  But granting one exception leads to the consideration of another,
 and soon the issue is perceived as complex and controversial, thus
 obscuring its horror.

<P>      No one can face the horror of the Nazi Holocaust and then say that
 a practice of this kind, while wrong, can be justified for certain exceptions.
 Perceiving a horror for what it is, and granting exceptions, are psychologically incompatible.
      
<P><LI><EM>The climate of opinion</EM>. Given that most people do not perceive
 abortion as a horror, any one person's perceptions and moral judgments
 are influenced by what others see, by the general climate of opinion.  "If
 most people don't see it, it's probably not there" - a plausible but often
 tragically false assumption.  Or: "How can abortion be murder, a terrible
 moral evil, when so many respectable people approve it?  When so many
 prominent organizations like the American Medical Association and
 various religious organizations approve it?" Part of the answer to this
 objection is what I shall call "the circle of mutual support." Some
 respectable people approve abortion because they see that others do.
 These others, in turn, approve it because they see that others do,
 including members of the first group.  And so there is a complete circle:
 abortion is accepted by group A because it is seen as accepted by group
  B, and it is accepted by group B because it is seen as accepted by group
  A. Each psychologically supports the other. This circle is virtually
  contained in the objection itself.  A given person does not condemn
  abortion as a horror precisely because he sees so many others whom he
  respects approving it.  And they in turn approve it because they see it
  approved by others.

<P>       "It can't be murder because it is so widely approved." On the
  contrary, it is widely approved because it is not seen as murder.  And it is
  not seen as murder because it is, instead, seen as widely approved.
       
<P>What we have in this objection is a classic example of the fallacy of
  shifting attention from the object (abortion itself) to people's attitudes
  towards it.  What matters is abortion itself, its nature as an action, the
  reasons for and against holding it to be a moral evil; not what people think
  about it.  The latter can never determine the moral rightness or wrongness
  of an action.  And so it is never appropriate to argue that an action cannot
  be wrong because people do not recognize it to be such, because people
  approve it.  If people approve something, the crucial question is, should
  they approve it?
       
<P>The circle of mutual support gains a further hold on people, and
  further force as a psychological factor when the actual practice of abortion
  is added.  "Abortion can't be murder, it can't be a terrible evil, because
  Miss Smith had one, and she's a respectable, nice person." But perhaps
  she had the abortion (in part) because she saw it approved by others
  ("therefore it can't be a moral horror"), and practiced by others.  And so the
  circle continues: abortion is accepted because it continues to be practiced, and it continues to be practiced because it is accepted.  The approval
  of abortion and its practice thus feed on each other.
       
<P>The circle phenomenon is part of a larger picture, the general social
  climate of moral opinion.  Many people adopt as their own opinion what
  is in fact the common or widely prevailing opinion in their society.  They
  join the stream of popular thinking.  They take it for granted, rather than
  challenging it or questioning it.  Such a stream may be the dominant,
  almost universally accepted opinion in a society; or it may be one of two
  or more opinions, as in the case of abortion today.  Either way, the
  opinions of many individuals are formed by the opinions of others.  It is
  not simply that they imitate the prevailing opinions.  It is, even more
  significantly, that they do not think of challenging them, or do not dare
  challenge them, because they are the dominant, prevailing opinions.
  There is a reluctance to criticize so many people, especially so many respectable people.  And so the phenomenon we are examining here arises:
  People say abortion is not murder, it is not a moral horror but a complex
  issue, because others see it this way.  But in fact it is murder, it is a horror,
   and people could come to see it for what it is, if they would only look at
   it, rather than at what others say about it, or what other people do.

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

Some moral matters are complex in the sense that they involve questions
   for which there really are no easy answers.  A psychiatrist learns something from his patient that represents a potential danger to a third party.
   Should he reveal it to the proper authorities?  Yes, to protect the third
   party.  No, because breaking the doctor-client seal of confidentiality is
   wrong and also leads to bad consequences.  Perhaps it depends on the
   seriousness of the danger and its likelihood.  In such a case, either
   position could be reasonably defended, with objectively valid arguments;
   and the different, and mutually opposed, positions all deserve respect.  I
   shall call this <EM>objective moral complexity</EM>.  There are many questions that
   fall into this category. They are characterized in general by the pull of
   opposing values.  Fidelity to promises and the protection of trust versus
   other values such as protecting life, the rights of the individual versus the
   good of society, and the allocation of scarce resources, are some common
   examples.

<P>        Objective moral complexity stands in contrast to things that are
   clearly wrong, and especially to moral horrors such as slavery and
   holocausts.  Here, of course, there is no pull of opposing values.  Slavery
   is a terrible evil, an absolute horror; there is nothing pulling in the
   opposite direction to mitigate its evil or to render it complex in the above
   sense.
       
<P> And yet slavery was a controversial issue in America for many years.
   It was a complex issue for many people.  I shall call this <EM>psychological
   complexity</EM>.  This term is intended to include sociological factors as well.
   Recall the items listed above under "The Lack of Perception": a lack of
   awareness of the child and of what abortion does to her, the veil of
   language, sympathy for the woman, being gripped by one aspect, the
   problem of possible exceptions, and others.  All of these factors help
   explain why abortion is perceived as complex instead of a horror, why it
   is (psychologically) complex for many people.  Similar factors help explain
   why slavery was perceived as complex instead of a horror.  The climate of
   opinion makes it understandable why people do not perceive the true
   horror of a massive evil, be it slavery or abortion.  They perceive it as
   complex instead.  But it is only complex for them, psychologically complex, not an objective moral complexity.  The circle of mutual support
   appears again.  "It can't be a horror because it's complex." On the contrary,
   it is not seen as a horror because it is considered complex.

       
<P> The fallacy in this reasoning turns on the confusion between the two
   types of complexity.  "It can't be a horror because it's complex." To make
   this true, or at least plausible, <EM>complex</EM> must mean moral complexity.  But
   in fact abortion is only psychologically complex, and when that meaning
   is applied, the statement is false.  What is psychologically complex may
   well be a moral horror, as in the case of slavery.  People rightly see the
   psychological complexity of abortion - that it can be an agonizing decision, that opinion is divided, etc.  They wrongly interpret this complexity
   as a moral complexity, and thus fail to grasp the horror of abortion.
       
<P> A brief comparison between mass abortion and slavery is useful at
   this point.<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#13>13</A></SUP> Both slavery and mass abortion singled out a whole class of
   human beings and deprived them of their most basic human rights.  In
   both instances the victims were treated as things, to be used or disposed
   of. Both were massive violations of human dignity.  Both continued
   because of the sheer might of those in power.  Both caused unspeakable
   suffering, and represented cruelty and injustice on a massive scale.  Both
   continued because of public approval or apathy or insufficient opposition.
       
<P> A further crucial point: in seeing the horror of slavery, we clearly see
   that no other good could ever justify it as a means to its achievement.
   Imagine saying, "Slavery is bad, but we need it for _____" (referring to some
   recognized good).  But that is exactly what is being said today. "Abortion
   is bad, but we need it for the benefit of women and their right to choose."
   If slavery cannot be justified on the grounds that it benefits people,
   neither can abortion.
       
<P> Slavery and mass abortion: Both are objective moral horrors, in
   contrast to objective moral complexities.  Both are, or have been, experienced as cases of psychological complexity.  What we see clearly in the
   case of slavery - that psychological complexity does not imply moral
   complexity - applies equally to abortion.  For both, being psychologically
   complex does not mean being morally complex.
       
<P> How could we have tolerated the horror of slavery, its physical
   cruelty, the disruption of families, the affront to human dignity?  How
   could we have been so blind?  As we look back at slavery, approved and
   tolerated in our country and practiced on a vast scale by respectable
   people, what can we say?

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        What will the Toynbees, the Gibbons, the Spenglers of the future say
        about the American Holocaust?  How could a nation which as recently
        as the late 1950s embraced what Langdon Jones has called the
        "Procreative Ethic" change in less than a generation into a giant
        human abattoir in which every third baby conceived is knived,
        poisoned, starved, choked or dismembered?<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#14>14</A></SUP>

<P>

<A NAME=Undeserved></A> <EM>The Undeserved Respectability of the Pro-Choice Position</EM>


<P> The abortion issue is generally seen as having two sides, each representing a morally plausible position.  They are somehow seen as roughly equal,
 sometimes in regard to the strength of their moral position, and almost
 always in regard to their respectability.  Apart from the sincerity that
 defenders of "pro-choice" may have, the pro-choice (pro-abortion) position is itself an immoral one, for it is the attempt to defend, and promote
 as respectable, the option of killing babies, and doing this on a massive
 scale.  It involves various attempts to camouflage this horror by the use
 of deceptive language, such as the "right to choose" (really, the "right to
 choose to kill a child"), and "product of conception" (for a small human
 person).  That the "pro-death" side succeeds in presenting itself as
 respectable, as an alternate moral viewpoint, only adds to the psychological complexity of abortion and makes it difficult to perceive it as the horror
 that it is.  "It's not a horror because its defense is a respectable position,
 one of two sides of a complex issue." On the contrary, it is not seen as the
 horror that it is because it is perceived, instead, as but one side of a
 complex issue.
      
<P>Furthermore, people hesitate to condemn abortion as a horror out
 of an understandable reluctance to condemn those who defend it. "It's
 their opinion.  How can I judge that they are not sincere?" Here the
 distinction between judging <EM>persons</EM> and judging <EM>actions</EM> is crucial.
 Granted, we should not judge persons (and their sincerity).  This does not
 say anything, however, about the nature of the action at hand.  If we keep
 this distinction clearly in mind, we can open our eyes to the horror of
 abortion as an action, and respond accordingly.  One reason we should
 not make moral judgments about persons is precisely because of the
 psychological complexity surrounding abortion today.  A complexity that
 in no way involves a moral complexity, and thus we can judge abortion
 as the horror that it is.

	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

<P>The theme of this chapter is the three-fold character of abortion: (1) that
 it is perceived as a morally complex issue, and therefore tolerated, its
 defense accepted as a respectable position. (2) that it is a psychologically
 complex issue, individually and socially. (3) and that is a moral horror, the
 massive killing of small babies to get them out of the way, a holocaust.

<P>       How can a holocaust be tolerated in a society that views itself as
 basically moral, concerned for the poor and the downtrodden?  How can
    it be that we have become "a giant human abattoir in which every third
    baby conceived is knived, poisoned, . . . choked or dismembered"?
       
<P>  One reason is lack of perception.  Another is that abortion is seen as
    a woman's choice.  This is the center and substance of the defense of
    abortion.  People defend it as a woman's choice; they tolerate it for fear of
    violating a woman's "right to choose."
       
<P>  What is the role of choice in the abortion question?  Does it have any
    moral or logical efficacy?  If not, why does it nonetheless play such a
    prominent role?  Does it contribute to the psychological complexity of
    abortion?
       
<P><OL><LI>A woman does not have the right to choose to have her child killed.
    She does not have this right morally; she should not have it legally.  This
    is absolutely clear from what has been established here. It must be
    emphasized, so that it is not forgotten or obscured.

<P><LI>The appeal to choice is not even an argument for justifying
    abortion, let alone a valid argument.  It is a slogan, an appeal, the
    expression of a desire.  Nothing in the notion of choice supports the
    contention that one has a right to a certain choice.  A racist can use the
    same slogan and say that he should have a choice in hiring, specifically
    the right to refuse employment to a qualified black applicant.  He wants
    a choice; this in no way shows that he is entitled to one.  It will be said that
    the stakes are higher for a woman seeking a choice regarding abortion,
    than an employer seeking choice in hiring.  Very true; and the stakes are
    higher for the victim of an abortion as well: the black applicant loses his
    livelihood and suffers an affront to his dignity, the child loses her life.

<P>         Choice has absolutely no substance either as a moral reality or as an
    argument for supporting abortion.  What it has is a psychological force,
    and this in a number of ways.  For example:
       
<P><LI>"Choice" has enough plausibility to function as an effective screen,
    hiding the true horror of abortion.  Those who defend abortion have
    cleverly seized on the idea of choice as an ingenious device to promote
    their cause, by which they are in fact promoting the massive killing of
    small babies.  To the extent that they succeed in bringing the killings
    under the mantle of something so respectable and positive as choice, they
    succeed in obscuring its horror.  Who wants to be against choice?  "Do you
    want to deny a woman a choice about something so intimate and private?"
    The success of this strategy stems from a number of factors, such as (A)
    the fact that choice as such is a positive thing. (But it is not the final word.
    The choice to kill, or to do any evil, is not a positive thing.) (B) The fact that,
    in one very important sense, a woman has a choice, namely, the choice
    between keeping or killing her baby. (But having such a choice says
    nothing about the rightness or wrongness of one or the other of the
  options that constitute that choice.) (C) The fact that in today's climate of
  women's rights, it is not easy to take a stand against something that is
  advocated as a fundamental right of women.  Not everyone is prepared,
  psychologically and logically, to offer the appropriate distinctions: legitimate women's rights, yes; the alleged right to have her baby killed, no.

<P><LI>"I'm personally opposed to abortion, but I do not want to impose
  this on others." Some who say this are not really opposed to abortion, but,
  on the contrary, are perfectly willing to see it continue.  The phrase
  "personally opposed" is merely a shield.  But there are others who say this
  with some measure of sincerity.  They really do see the wrongness of
  abortion, but they are victims of the psychological power of the pro-choice
  slogan.  Somehow the force of this slogan overcomes their vision of the
  horror of abortion, and it weakens their determination to stand up and
  be counted as opposed to this evil.  As one of my students put it, "Although
  I am opposed to abortion, I feel that I do not have the right to choose for
  others.  Therefore, I remain pro-choice." This was the conclusion of a
  paper presenting reasons why abortion is wrong, even a horrible wrong.

<P>       Imagine someone saying, "I'm personally opposed to beating small
  children to death, but I do not want to impose this on others." Why does
  this sound so absurd, whereas the same thing said for a preborn child,
  does not sound so absurd?  Why is the latter so readily accepted?  Because
  of the psychological force of one word: choice.  A simple reply to this
  reasoning is that no one should choose to impose death on the child.
  Especially not such a cruel death, as by a one- to two-hour saline
  poisoning or by dismemberment.
       
<P><LI>In a presidential debate with George Bush on October 13, 1988,
  Michael Dukakis said that abortion is an agonizing, difficult choice.  A
  choice that must be left up to the woman, that she must decide according
  to her own conscience, her values, her religious beliefs.  That it is
  impossible to say in general who should live and who should not.  He was
  speaking for many people when he said this.  It sounds so lofty and
  compassionate, with the focus on the difficult situation that the woman
  is in. It evokes sympathy for her.  Isn't this good?  Yes and no.  Yes, we
  should empathize with the woman, support her, but not by sacrificing her
  child to an agonizing death.

<P>       It is difficult to criticize this position, it sounds so noble.  No one
  wants to deny, or make light of, an agonizing decision.  And yet we must
  ask what this position is really saying.  It is saying that a woman should
  have a choice, where one option is the killing of a small child (in an
  agonizing way).The very difficulty one experiences in holding this position
  up to the light of day, as legitimizing the option to murder a child, stems
  from the psychological power of the idea of choice.  At the heart of this
  powerful appeal is the thesis that a woman should have a choice.

<P>       This appeal is defused when one realizes that its power is only
   psychological, not moral.  Morally, what is being asked for is a horror, the
   option to murder a child.  The decision may be psychologically complex for
   the woman.  Morally it is not complex at all, it is a clear-cut terrible evil.
       
<P> When blacks are mistreated in a certain society, we do not spin a tale
   about complex, agonizing decisions for the whites in power, when one of
   the options they may choose (according to their conscience, etc.) is
   treating blacks as less than full persons.  We condemn the evil of racism;
   we do not condone choice.  It is no different when the minority group in
   question is the preborn.  What is presented as a lofty appeal to respect
   conscience is, in fact, a license to kill.  Such is the appeal of choice.
       
<P><LI>Many people urge a "balanced view" that avoids the extremes of
   allowing all abortions or banning all abortions.  The person most intimately involved, the woman, decides which ones.

<P>        It sounds attractive - until we realize that it means that some human
   beings are abandoned to the power of others to choose their deaths.  And
   (especially) to choose to carry this out by dismemberment, poisoning and
   burning for one to two hours.  Some things must indeed be balanced
   against others, but not the killing of innocent babies.
       
<P> Racial justice demands that we respect all members of every minority
   in every essential way, above all, in regard to their life.  The same is true
   for that neglected minority, preborn children.  Who could plausibly urge
   a "balanced view" for racial justice?  Why then is it urged for preborn
   persons?  It sounds plausible, even attractive, for the latter because of the
   psychological power of choice.
       
<P><LI>Implicit in much of the defense of the pro-abortion position is the
   idea that being wanted is what makes something a human person.  If the
   talk is about saving the being in the womb, she is called a child, or a baby.
   "We saved the baby." If it is about abortion, she is called a fetus. "We
   removed the fetus." The idea that being wanted is what makes something
   a person is absurd on the level of rational thought.  Clearly, he or she is
   a person, whether wanted or not wanted.  The metaphysical status of a
   being, whether "it" is a person or not, cannot possibly be determined by
   whether or not "it" is wanted.  This is so obvious - how could anyone
   possibly hold the view that being wanted is necessary to being a person?

<P>        The answer, once again, is choice.  The idea that a person is human
   only if he is wanted is an expression of a woman's right to choose.  Her
   choosing to have the child makes him a real child.  Her choosing to have
   the abortion makes him a non-person.  Choice is supreme; actual
   metaphysical status and consequent ethical demands are swept aside.
       
<P> This defense of abortion is not a genuine moral argument.  It is not,
   "Abortion is morally right, therefore, a woman has a right to choose it."
   Rather: "A woman has a right to choose.  Therefore, abortion is right if she
   so chooses." And, "Since it is wrong to kill persons, the being in the womb
   cannot be a person if the woman chooses to abort him.  He is a person only
   if he is wanted.  If he is unwanted, he is a non-person (perhaps a mass of
   tissue), who may be killed."
       
<P> Here is the core difference between the two movements.  Pro-life asks,
   "Is it a person?  Does abortion kill a person?" Looking at the evidence, it
   becomes clear that the answer to both questions is yes.  Therefore,
   abortion is morally wrong.  It is a horror, especially if we add how it is done,
   and that it is carried out on a massive scale.
       
<P> Pro-choice starts with the woman's right to choose.  It is this which
   determines everything else.  If her choice is to have the baby, then her
   wanting him makes him a person. If her choice is abortion, then her not
   wanting him reduces him to a non-person.  The questions, whether the
   being really is a person, and whether abortion means killing, interfere
   with the promotion of choice.  Their urgency is denied; choice is the
   supreme principle.
       
<P><LI>"I think women should have a choice because if I ever got pregnant,
   I would want a choice." Part of the movement for choice is, "I want it,
   therefore it should be." A moral guideline is derived from a desire. The
   right to choose is presented as if it were a genuine moral right: in fact, it
   is only the expression of a strong desire.  But the presentation of this
   desire as a moral right gives it great psychological power and helps make
   abortion socially acceptable, hence tolerated, leading to its widespread
   practice.

<P><LI>"If women are not given a choice, they will resort to back-alley
   abortions, or self-induced abortions, as by coat hangers.  Many will be
   maimed, many will die.  The results will be horrible."

        <P><EM>The present state is horrible!</EM> Every third child cut to pieces, burned
   and poisoned, or crushed to death.  The very horror that this argument
   appeals to is repeated in <EM>every abortion</EM>. One can hardly be against
   horrible mutilation and death for one group of people, while condoning it
   for others.  If back-alley abortions are also devastating to women, then
   that is an additional reason for not choosing them.  No abortions should
   be chosen, neither socially and legally approved ones, nor disapproved
   ones.  What this argument shows is only that some abortions are still
   worse than others, namely, those that also destroy women.

<P>        In addition, it must be stressed that the popular assumption that
   legal abortions are safe (for the woman; they are obviously deadly for the
   child) while illegal abortions are dangerous does not stand up against the
   facts.  <EM>Legal abortions kill women!</EM> Reardon reports that "though the odds
   of any particular woman suffering ill effects from an abortion have
  dropped, the <EM>total</EM> number of women who suffer and die from abortion is
  far greater than ever before."<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#15>15</A></SUP> The myth of safe legal abortion persists
  largely because "the reported rate of deaths due to legal abortion is being
  deliberately kept low through selective underreporting."<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#16>16</A></SUP>

<P>
       It must also be realized that the "back alley" argument is not really
  an argument for abortion.  It does nothing to show that abortion is not the
  murder of a child (nor does it even attempt to).  Its appeal is a psychologically powerful way of expressing the desire (or the demand) to have a
  choice.  It is a kind of threat: "Give us choice, or else." It offers nothing to
  substantiate one's right to choose.  It only points to a feared consequence
  of its denial.  That the denial of something leads to bad consequences in
  no way establishes a right to it.  A policy of equal treatment for blacks
  might lead to terrible riots.  That hardly shows that blacks do not have
  equal rights, or that anyone has the right to deny them equal rights.  So
  too, no one has the right to deny equal rights to preborn persons,
  regardless of the consequences.
       </OL>

<P>The appeal to choice is a major factor making abortion psychologically complex.  If a person does not clearly see the horror of abortion, if he
  nonetheless sees something wrong in taking human life; and if, on the
  other hand, the appeal to choice makes an impact on him, then it becomes
  very understandable that he perceives abortion as a conflict of values, an
  issue that is hard to sort out - in short, a complex issue.
       
<P>But isn't abortion really complex (morally) in the case of pregnancy
  due to rape or incest?  Or if the woman's life or health is threatened?
  Should she not have a choice in such cases?  These questions will be
  pursued in the next chapter.

	An Abortion Pill
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

When an abortion pill is developed, will abortion still be the horror
  described here?  Suppose it replaces the ghastly methods of cutting the
  child to pieces or burning her skin while poisoning her.  Will this diminish
  the horror of abortion?

<P>       An abortion pill would be just as horrible, and in some respects,
  worse.
       
<P><OL><LI>Abortion, by whatever means, at whatever age, with or without
  pain, is still murder.

<P><LI>The way in which an abortion pill brings about the death of the
  child could be just as ghastly as the current surgical methods.  There is
  nothing in the nature of a pill to preclude this.  It might, for example, slowly
 crush the child to death by activating certain muscles.  It might slowly
 choke her to death.  We would then have exactly the same grim horror of
 abortion that we now have.

<P><LI>If the child's pain receptors are in place and functioning at the time
 that the pill works, then she would be subject to whatever pain the pill is
 capable of causing.  Again, there is nothing in the nature of a pill to
 preclude this.  Once more, we would see a repetition of the present horrible
 methods of abortion with respect to the terrible pain they cause the child.

<P><LI>The idea of a pill is to make abortion easier, more efficient, and
 private.  It will not require a trip to the "clinic": it can be taken at home like
 an aspirin. This will, of course, increase the number of abortion killings.
 The present holocaust will get worse as more babies are murdered.  Each
 gain in ease means an increase in the quantitative dimension of the
 abortion horror.

<P>       A recent article compared the transition from surgical abortion to a
 pill to the leap from conventional warfare to nuclear warfare.<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#17>17</A></SUP> Killing
 would become easy: just take a pill.  And with this, our reluctance to kill
 will diminish.  That represents a quantum leap in horror, the advent of
 "nuclear war" on the unborn in terms of the massive scale on which they
 will be killed, and the ease with which we kill them.
       
<P>Though largely hidden from public view today, the horror of surgical
 abortion can still be made manifest by describing the methods and
 showing the pictures.  That will be much more difficult if not impossible
 with the pill.  Abortion will be cloaked in a mantle of privacy.  Preborn
 children will be still less protected, and many more of them will be
 murdered.
       
<P><LI>What does killing represent for the person who does the killing?
 A terrible evil, a heavy burden on one's conscience when one realizes the
 horror of killing.  For aborting women, the effect of taking the pill will be
 no less than requesting a surgical abortion.  In some ways, it will be worse.
 With the pill, the woman herself becomes the agent of death.  And with the
 ease of the pill, many more women will become agents of death, and so
 the evil and the burden of having killed another human being win fall on
 many more women.
</OL>

<P>       At this writing, the new RU-486 abortion pill is in the news.  The
 woman takes it and waits anxiously.<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#18>18</A></SUP> If the pill succeeds (as it does about
 80% of the time), a dead, bloody baby will be washed out.  If not, she must
 repeat.  She takes three pills, waits two days while the child dies, then
 takes prostaglandin and waits five to eight days for the bloody remains of
 the child to flow out.  In about five percent of the cases she is not successful
 even then, and a surgical abortion is needed to complete the job of killing.
 The anxious wait, the uncertainty, the length of time cannot but heighten
  the agonizing drama of this experience.  This is no "get it over and done
  with" method of killing the child.  The woman is drawn into the death
  process at a time when she is particularly sensitive and susceptible to
  psychological stress and trauma.


  
<P><A NAME=Conclusion></A><EM>Conclusion</EM>


<P>  Some of the dimensions of the horror of abortion include:

<P><OL><LI>The horror for each child.  Recall the methods, the pictures.

<P><LI>The horror of the abortion holocaust.  "The legalized execution of
  sixteen million unborn children bears powerful witness to the infinite
  capacity of the human heart for cruelty and self-deception.  As a culture,
  we have broken our moorings and set sail on the bloody seas of mass
  extermination."<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#19>19</A></SUP>

<P><LI>Any murder is a terrible thing, but when a person is deprived of
  his whole future life, a new dimension of horror is added.
       
<P><LI>Abortion is perpetrated on a mass scale, by the most horrible
  methods.  It is being carried out and defended as a practice that is largely
  accepted by the society, its defenders enjoying a respected position.  It is
  being done because those who carry out the abortions have absolute
  power over their victims.  The preborn child is destroyed through the sheer
  might of the doctor, who simply takes advantage of his superior power,
  and the absolute helplessness of the child.  She cannot cry out for help,
  she cannot defend herself, she cannot escape.  She is trapped in a death
  chamber - a chamber that should have protected and nurtured her.  We
  are horrified when we see a strong person brutally killing a small child by
  means of his superior power.  This is a picture of an abortion.

<P>       Suppose, in the encounter between doctor and child, the child won
  half of the time, and killed the doctor in self-defense - something he would
  have every right to do.  Very few doctors would still perform abortions.
  They perform them now only because of their absolute power over a small
  fragile, helpless victim.
       
<P><LI>Then there is abortion as sex selection.  Pro-abortion is presented
  as pro-choice.  Sometimes this choice is exercised in choosing the sex of
  the child: a baby boy is wanted, a baby girl is unwanted and therefore
  killed.  Many people are horrified.  But it is perfectly consistent with the
  logic of choice: "Abortion is a difficult decision; it is up to the woman to
  choose." So some women choose to kill their daughters in the womb.
  "Tens of thousands of fetuses, perhaps hundreds of thousands, have
  already been destroyed in Third World countries for the offense of being
  female."<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#20>20</A></SUP> And in the United States, "The <EM>New York Times</EM> has reported a new
  poll [December 1988] showing that nearly 20 per cent of ... geneticists
  now approve the practice [of abortion for sex selection].<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#21>21</A></SUP>


<P><LI>To stop the abortion holocaust, we must first come to see it as a
  holocaust.

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         The prevailing view of abortion in contemporary society is that of a
         minor surgical procedure carried out by upstanding physicians in the
         antiseptic settings of clinics and hospitals.  It is this highly positive
         image concocted by members of the medical establishment, legitimized by the legal structure, buttressed by linguistic technicians,
         implemented by advanced technologies, and disseminated by a media
         elite - which helps sustain the assembly-line massacre of over one
         and one-half million unborn children annually in America alone.

<P>               The present-day carnage directed against the unwanted unborn
         will not begin to cease until a much larger segment of the public
         becomes aware of an entirely different perception of abortion as a
         horrendous holocaust comparable to the enormous destruction perpetrated on the unwanted of the Third Reich.<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#22>22</A></SUP>

<P>         In the end, the issue is not just about preborn babies; it is about
  all of us.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         The battle for life is not between pro-lifers and pro-abortionists,
         traditionalists and feminists, but rather between justice and injustice.  Our opponents and their allies in the media know this deep down
         in their hearts, which is why they denounce us so bitterly.  The
         battlelines are clear: Either life is for everyone, or the right to life is
         doled out at the whim of the powerful.  Abortion represents in
         miniature a struggle that ultimately must result in the total victory of
         one answer to this question or the other, for the principles at stake are
         absolutely irreconcilable.

<P>               If the partisans of "choice" win, what remains of our tattered
         sanctity of life ethic will be dismantled, piece by bloody piece.  Because
         it is based on the right of the more powerful to oppress the less
         powerful, the pro-abortion position is at war with the core principles
         of our nation.
       
<P>        So blinded are they by their own rhetoric, they hold "choice" to
         their bosoms as if it represented a kind of philosopher's stone that
         magically turns cruelty into kindness, selfishness into altruism.  But
         barbarism with a human face is still barbarism."<SUP><A HREF=notes9.htm#23>23</A></SUP>

	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

Is abortion justified in the name of helping a woman who has been the
 victim of rape or incest? Or whose health or life is threatened by the
 continuation of the pregnancy?  In answering these questions, we should
 be guided by two principal considerations.  First, full and equal concern
 for all persons involved, the woman and the child, identifying with each.
 Second, adherence to the principle that we may never do wrong to one
 person in order to benefit another.

	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

<OL><LI>The child conceived in rape is one of us, merely smaller and less
 developed and more dependent, and not in full view, but equally a person.
 Killing her is wrong, just as killing any child is wrong. We must remember
 that the child is absolutely innocent of the crime of her father.  She is not
 a part of her mother's body, and she is not a part of her father's character.
 She inherits character traits from both her parents, but in her individual being as a person, she is absolutely distinct from both of them.
 Even the character traits that are received from a parent are now her own
 traits.  The child is totally her own person.  She is not responsible for the
 crime that led to her conception, and she is untainted by it.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#1>1</A></SUP> Seeing her
 in these negative ways is sheer prejudice, not based on reality, but at odds
 with it.
      
<P><LI>Rape is horrible beyond words.  So is abortion.  Abortion means
 killing a child in ghastly ways that probably cause terrible pain.  Abortion
 for rape is wrong because it adds a second horror to the first: the murder
 of an innocent child.
      
<P><LI>If abortion for a child conceived in loving intercourse is murder,
 it is still murder when the child is conceived in other forms of intercourse,
 as in rape.  The form of intercourse, whether voluntary or forced, has no
 bearing on the dignity and preciousness of the child conceived.  And it has
 no bearing on the question of whether abortion is murder.  Abortion is
 murder because of what it does to its victim, the innocent child, regardless
 of how she was conceived.

<P><LI>We all identify with the woman.  We must do the same for the child.
 We must identify with her, picture her in our minds and have compassion
 for her.  We will then say, "Do not kill this child! Spare her the agonizing
 death of dismemberment or burning of her skin."

<P><LI>We may never do evil to achieve good.  Denying a woman an
 abortion for rape is not a denial of the woman and of concern for her. It
 is a refusal to do evil.  We could never kill the woman in attempting to
 benefit someone else in a way that is comparable to the alleged benefit for
 the woman expected of an abortion.  If we cannot kill the woman to achieve
 an expected good, we cannot kill the child for a similar purpose either.
 There must be full and equal concern for both woman and child.

<P><LI>A specific application of this principle is that we may never kill
 innocent person B to save person A. We cannot kill John by removing a
 vital organ in order to save Mary, who needs it.  This is not a lack of
 compassion for Mary, it is the refusal to commit murder, even for a good
 cause.  John has a right not to be killed to benefit Mary, even to save her
 life.  Mary has the same right.  We could not kill the woman to benefit the
 child.  Equally, we cannot kill the child to benefit the woman.

<P><LI>As a general principle, it is wrong to force a person to do something
 he has no duty to do.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#2>2</A></SUP> The wrongness of kidnapping is, in part, that person
 A forces person B to come with him, something which B has no duty to
 do. A slaveowner forces a slave to work for him, something that the latter
 has no duty to do.  In contrast, a motorist has a duty to stop when so
 ordered by a police officer, who therefore does no wrong in ordering him
 to do so.
<P>
      An especially important application of this principle, which we may
 call the No Duty-Non Forcing Principle, is this: You have no duty to lay
 down your life to save another, still less to benefit her in some lesser way.
 Therefore, it would be wrong for anyone to force you to do so.  Exactly the
 same applies to the child in the womb.  She too has no duty to give up her
 life for another, including her mother.  Therefore, it would be wrong to
 force her to do so by killing her.  That she was conceived in violent
 intercourse changes nothing with regard to her being as a person, and her
 rights as a person - including her right not to be forced to die to benefit
 someone else.

<P>        Our two principles - full and equal concern for both mother and
   child, and that we may not do wrong to one in order to benefit the other -
   lead to some further points.
       
<P><LI>The moral judgment called for here - that abortion is wrong
   because it is wrong to commit murder to alleviate suffering - is basically
   a positive one for the child, not a negative one against the woman.  It is
   made to protect the child, that she not be the victim of a second violence.
   It is not made to restrict the woman; it merely expresses the obligation to
   respect the child as a person.

<P><LI>The question of abortion is often presented as a conflict of rights:
   Whose rights are to prevail, mother's or child's?  The real question is not
   <EM>whose</EM> rights are to prevail, but <EM>which</EM> rights: the right of the woman to
   try to alleviate her pain, or the right of the child to live?  Clearly the latter.
   So, it is not that one person is an adult and another is a child.  It is that,
   in general, the right to alleviate the pain of one person cannot be exercised
   by denying the right of another person to live.

<P><LI>Refusal to allow abortion for rape cases is not a failure of
   compassion.  On the contrary, allowing abortion is a lack of compassion
   for preborn children.  It is approving their murder, the violation of their
   most fundamental right, the right to live.  Saying no to the woman is not
   a lack of compassion for her, but simply calling attention to what abortion
   really is: murder.  Refusal to sanction murder is not a lack of compassion.

	Claim that Rape is Different
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

Many people who otherwise oppose abortion feel that the case of rape is
   different, and that the elements that make up this difference are sufficient
   to justify abortion.

<P>        First, "The woman was not given a choice.  Had she freely engaged in
   the sexual act, she should now bear the responsibility for its consequence.  But since it was forced on her, she should not be forced to
   continue the resulting pregnancy." In reply, if I am unjustly denied a
   choice, does that give me the right to kill an innocent person?  I may not
   kill the person who denied me the choice (after the fact, as a way of trying
   to compensate for the denial of choice), nor may I kill a person totally
   innocent of unjustly denying me a choice.  This is the child in the womb.
       
<P> Second, "A woman should not have to endure a forced pregnancy."
   We must have the greatest compassion and sympathy for a woman who
   finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy that was forced upon her.  We
   must support and encourage her, not destroy her innocent child.  We
   sometimes find ourselves in situations where we are forced to do
  something difficult because the only alternative is to do a moral evil.  A
  person in a concentration camp may have the opportunity to become an
  informer, which means a better life for him.  But it also means betraying
  his friends and causing them additional suffering.  Morally, he is forced
  to remain in his present, pitiable state, rather than do a moral evil, namely
  betraying his friends, perhaps causing their deaths.  If a woman is forced
  to continue a pregnancy, the case is similar in this respect, that she too
  is forced to remain in a pitiable state because the alternative is a moral
  evil, the killing of an innocent child.
       
<P>Third, "It was wrong for the woman to have been raped.  It is wrong
  that she have this child.  Therefore, she can now get rid of it through an
  abortion.  She is justified in righting this wrong by removing the result of
  it." It certainly was wrong that the woman was raped. And this carries over
  in a certain way to the presence of the child.  But the conclusion, that she
  can now get rid of it, does not follow. The child is <EM>her</EM> child. This remains
  true even when the child is conceived in violent intercourse and forced on
  her.  The reality of the child as a person, and as entrusted to the woman
  as her mother, remains fully intact.  The woman may not get rid of the child
  if this means child neglect, still less if it means killing, as in abortion.
       
<P>Two wrongs do not make a right: they remain two wrongs.  If you are
  wronged by person A, you cannot turn around and do wrong to person B
  as a way of undoing the first wrong.  For example, if you are kidnapped by
  A, you cannot escape by killing innocent person B. The woman has been
  wronged by the rapist, A. She cannot now try to undo this wrong or its
  effects by doing wrong to her baby, B. Innocent person B has no duty to
  give up her life for another, either to benefit the other or to allow the other
  to right a wrong.  Therefore, no one may force her to do so by killing her.
       
<P>Fourth, "The child is a constant reminder of the horror of the rape
  experience.  The woman should be allowed to get rid of this reminder."
       
<P>To those who advance this point: Do you really mean to say that we
  can kill an innocent person on the grounds that she is a reminder of some
  horrible event? "But the child is a reminder inside her, so intimately
  involved with her." True, and this means a significant psychological
  difference from other cases.  But it is not a morally relevant difference.
       
<P>The child is a reminder of a horrible, violent act: rape.  This by no
  means allows us to destroy her by another violent act: abortion.
       
<P>Fifth.  "A woman has the right to defend herself against the threat to
  her well-being posed by the child conceived in rape." A full analysis of
  killing in defense will be presented later in this chapter.  It win be shown
  that three conditions must be met before a person has the right to kill
  another person in self-defense: (1) It must be an extremely serious threat,
  such as the threat of murder. (2) There must be no other alternative, such
    as running away or disarming the attacker. (3) The other must be an
    aggressor, an unjust attacker, and not merely someone who is in some
    unintended way causing the first person's death.

<P>       Does a pregnancy due to rape meet all these conditions?  Most
    important, it fails condition 3 because the child is not an aggressor.  She
    is absolutely innocent, in no way responsible for her coming into existence
    at this time and under these circumstances.  It is only the rapist-father
    who is an unjust aggressor.  Would it be right to kill him to prevent the
    rape?  If not, then condition 1 is presumably not met.  If it would be right,
    because this condition is met, it does not follow that it would also be right
    to kill the child.  This is because (a) the rapist is an unjust aggressor while
    the child is not, and (b) because the killing would prevent the rape while
    the abortion would not.  Finally, condition 2 is not met because there are
    alternatives to abortion in case of rape, which are even better for the
    woman, as will be shown.
       
<P> Thus the appeal to self-defense cannot justify abortion for rape.
    Condition 3 is clearly not met - that is already sufficient.  Condition 2 is
    also not met and 1 is doubtful.


<P><EM>    Emotional Factors</EM>


<P>    There are valid emotional perceptions and responses, as when we feel
    compassion and sympathy for the woman and for the preborn child. There
    are also invalid emotional perceptions and responses: disgust at a child
    conceived in rape, and at the woman and her condition, denial and a
    desire to push it all aside.
       
<P>  If we come to recognize what these factors are, and that they are
    invalid, we will be able to view abortion for rape as what it really is: the
    unjustified killing of an innocent child, a terrible moral evil.  Some of the
    invalid emotional factors are:
       
<P><OL><LI>The desire to seek retribution against the rapist for the terrible
    thing he has done.  As one cannot get at him directly, one tries to do so
    indirectly, at what is seen as "a part of him," his child. The child is
    attacked as a symbol of the rapist and his deed.  But of course the child
    is not part of the rapist - no child is part of his father or mother.  The
    association with the rapist father is completely unjust and unwarranted.
    The child of rape, like any other child, is completely his own person.
    The symbol is in the eye of the beholder - and should be removed.

<P><LI>The desire to get rid of the whole rape episode.  However, abortion
    does not unrape a woman.  In fact it adds more of the same: terrible
    violence against an innocent victim.

<P><LI>The desire to destroy the child because he is seen as an attacker.
      
<P><LI>The child is seen as "dirty" because of how he was conceived.

<P><LI>The child is "half the rapist's, therefore half evil."
</OL>

<P>       Only the rapist is an attacker, only he has done something that
 makes it understandable that he would be considered dirty.  Nothing of
 this logically transfers to the child.  Every child is his or her own person.
 He certainly inherits physical and psychological traits from each of his
 parents, but not features such as being an aggressor or innocent.  "dirty"
 or "clean," evil or good.

	Rape Abortion, What It Really Is
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

Abortion for rape is, first of all, more of the same, a horrible violence
 against an innocent person, unable to ward off the brutal attack.  Ellen
 McCormack gives us "a thought to ponder a minute":

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        My attacker was tormented and sought peace.  He didn't get it.  In his
        attempt, however, he tore my life apart.  Now I, in turn, am tormented
        and seek peace.  Will I get it through abortion? In my desperate search,
        will I make the baby suffer, have his life torn apart as mine has been?
        Or will I do what nobody else in the world can do?  Will I sustain and
        nourish this baby's life?  Will I keep his heart beating?  Will I give him
        a future?<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#3>3</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>       Second, abortion does not unrape a woman.  The horrible event is
 past, done, and cannot be undone.
      
<P> Third, what if the womb had a window, so you could actually see the
 child?  Suppose the window could be opened, and you could actually hold
 her?<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#4>4</A></SUP> What if she could plead with you to spare her life?  To spare her
 from the ordeal of an abortion killing?  Wouldn't your heart go out to her?
 Isn't it morally irrelevant that she cannot be seen, or held, or that she
 cannot plead on her own behalf?
       
<P>Fourth, what if there were a small, fully developed person inside the
 woman?  It would not be right to kill her if she had been conceived in rape.
 Isn't it morally irrelevant that she is not yet fully developed?
       
<P>Fifth, when the child conceived in rape is perceived as tainted, dirty,
 evil, etc., isn't this a prejudice?  In reality, she is absolutely innocent, she
 is her own person, as precious as any other person.  Isn't prejudice against
 such a child as irrational, and as morally evil, as any other prejudice?
       
<P>Sixth, would you kill the born child of a rapist, if that was expected
 to provide a benefit similar to what is expected of abortion for rape?  If not
 a born child, why a preborn child?

<P>       Seventh, if the idea is to destroy all vestiges of the horrible deed, one
   should kill the rapist who did it.  If that is wrong, it is also wrong to kill a
   child totally innocent of the deed.  Willke puts it well when he says, "Isn't
   it a twisted logic that would kill an innocent unborn baby for the crime
   of his father!"<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#5>5</A></SUP>

<P>       Eighth, the child is being sacrificed for the benefit of another.  He has
   no duty to do this; it is not right to force him.  Would those who favor
   abortion for rape volunteer their lives so that another may be benefited
   in a similar way?  If not, is it right to force this on another person?  If yes,
   at least they have the opportunity to make a choice; the child does not.

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

There are two fundamental reasons why we must be firm and hold
   steadfastly to the wrongness of abortion for rape.  One is the injustice and
   suffering for the individual child; the other is the all-important matter of
   moral principle.  If we say that abortion, though generally wrong, is
   justified for rape, we surrender the principle that one may never kill an
   innocent person to save or benefit another.  Once this principle is
   abandoned by allowing an exception for rape cases, questions of other
   exceptions will naturally arise.  "If abortion... [is] allowable in some cases,
   such as with rape, there ... [is] no justifiable reason to 'arbitrarily' forbid
   abortion under other compelling circumstances."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#6>6</A></SUP> And who will decide
   which circumstances are compelling?  The woman, or the woman in
   consultation with her doctor? That means abortion on demand.

<P>        "Abortion only for rape" is a wedge that opens the door to all
   abortions.  The sequence is quite logical.  Once we accept the idea that
   abortion can be justified if the need is great enough, we accept the idea
   that an innocent person may be sacrificed for the sake of others.  That idea
   underlies all abortions.  With that idea in place, it becomes impossible to
   resist other abortions.  "If she had an abortion because of her needs, why
   can't I?" Indeed, why not?  If her child can be killed for her benefit, why not
   yours for your benefit?
       
<P> Abortion is murder.  Murder is never justified, even to alleviate great
   pain, and even if there was a prior injustice, such as the child being forced
   on the woman against her will.
       
<P> It is sometimes said that pregnancy due to rape is extremely rare.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#7>7</A></SUP>   Rare or not, it is still an important topic because of the role it plays in
   people's thinking.  Many oppose abortion except in this case. Their
   position is fundamentally flawed.  It contains an inherent contradiction.
   If our commitment to the reality of the child and her right not to be killed
  for the sake of another person, is not firmly and consistently held, it will
  not be strong enough to defend the lives of other preborn children either.
  The position that abortion is wrong except in the case of rape cannot
  ultimately be maintained in the face of pro-abortion challenges.

<P>       If pregnancy due to rape is as rare as is generally maintained, the
  above position would lead to an unspeakable tragedy.  For the sake of a
  (misguided) compassion in a few rare cases, a huge class of preborn
  children is surrendered to the choice of those who are ready to destroy
  them.



<P><A NAME=Objections></A><EM>  Objections and Replies</EM>


<P><OL><LI>"A rape victim must not be punished by a forced pregnancy." Punishment is a response to a wrongdoer for the wrong he has done. The woman
  in being raped has obviously done no wrong.  She is not being punished.
  She is only being asked to respect the life of another person, her own child;
  to do no violence to the child as was done to her.  This burden is a suffering
  she must bear in order to avoid committing murder.  Suffering as such is
  not punishment.  The suffering we must bear in order not to do evil is
  clearly not punishment.

<P><LI>"The woman has suffered enough." Indeed.  Any suffering of a rape
  victim is more than should be.  She is not being asked to suffer more: she
  is being asked not to inflict death upon her child.  That carrying the child
  is a further suffering for her means that the original act of violence
  inflicted this suffering on her too.  Moreover, it is not at all clear that
  abortion represents a mitigation of her suffering; it may well cause
  additional suffering, greater suffering than carrying the child to term.

<P><LI>"Aren't there any exceptions to the rule against abortion?  Don't all
  rules have exceptions?  Isn't abortion for rape an obvious example?  Rules
  should not be followed rigidly.  A humane ethics allows for exceptions, it
  calls for a flexible application of moral rules, as opposed to a rigid
  legalism." To say yes to the mother in allowing her to have an abortion as
  an exception is to say no to the child in agreeing to have her killed.  What
  is called a humane exception is actually a death warrant for the child.

<P>       Killing in defense against an unjust attacker is one exception to the
  rule against killing.  There may or may not be others.  The crucial point
  concerns what is not an exception: killing an innocent person to try to
  alleviate the pain of another person.  That is what the exception to the rule
  against killing asks for in the case of abortion for rape.
       
<P>Holding fast to the principle that we may not wrong B to help A is not
  an inflexible rigid legalism.  It is simply faithfulness to moral principle.
   This is clear when the principle is applied in other areas.  We may not try
   to benefit society as a whole by denying black people their rights, or by
   denying women their rights.  Saying no to abortion for rape is simply
   applying this principle consistently to the child.
       
<P> Thus what may seem an inflexible or inhumane rule, the insistence
   that the child in the womb not be killed, that no exception be made, is
   actually something positive and supremely humane: the protection of an
   innocent person.
       
<P><LI>"To deny a woman an abortion even in the case of rape is an
   extreme position.  Granted, abortion is wrong, but to go so far as to deny
   its legitimacy in the case of rape is going too far." The crucial question
   about a thesis or position is not whether it is extreme, but whether it is
   true.  Should all innocent human persons be respected?  Or only most
   people, almost all people, so that we do not adopt an extreme position?
   When it comes to respecting the civil rights of blacks, should it be most
   rights, of most blacks, most of the time? Or should it be <EM>all</EM> rights, of <EM>all</EM>
   blacks, <EM>all</EM> the time?  Extreme or not, this is the only realistic moral
   position.  The same applies to all people.

<P><LI>"Abortion is an evil but it is sometimes necessary.  We must be
   realistic.  And surely abortion for rape is a case where abortion is
   necessary." Realistically, to allow abortion for rape is not only to violate
   the right to life of the individual child involved, but also to open the door
   to all abortions.  What is necessary is the recognition, and the putting into
   practice, of the two principles: equal concern for both persons, and never
   doing wrong to one to benefit the other.

<P><LI>"Isn't abortion a morally complex issue in the case of rape?
   Shouldn't the woman have a choice?" What was shown in chapter 9, that
   abortion is complex only in the psychological sense, that morally it is a
   horror, applies here as well.  Abortion for rape is a clear-cut evil.  This can
   be seen if the principle is kept in mind that the right of person B to live,
   not to be murdered, clearly overrides any right of person A to try to
   alleviate the pain and trauma of a horrible experience such as rape.
   Important as the degree of pain and trauma is in itself, it does not affect
   this principle.  It is not true that a very great pain may be alleviated by
   doing something that violates the right of another person to live.  No pain
   justifies abortion.  It is clear that we cannot kill the woman to alleviate the
   pain of another person, even a very great pain.  The woman's right to live
   absolutely prevails.  The child is no different.  Her right to live absolutely
   prevails.

<P><LI>"If your daughter were pregnant due to rape, wouldn't you want
   her to have an abortion?  Especially if she were very young, say twelve
   years old?" My personal response is no.  No, I would not want her to
   commit murder.  That would be still worse, in itself and for her, than the
   anguish and pain of her situation.  Is this answer heartless, lacking in
   compassion?  Not at all.  It is the answer of compassion: (a) for my
   daughter's child, that this child not be killed, that she not be the victim
   of a second violence; (b) for my daughter, that she not participate in a
   murder, and (c) for my daughter's own psychological and physical well-being, for reasons that I will show in the next section.

<P>        I would suffer with my daughter, I would support her, I would love
   her all the more, I would help her in whatever way I could.  I would do
   anything I could do; there is much I cannot do.  I cannot undo the past,
   I cannot undo the rape.  And, I cannot undo the pregnancy; I cannot agree
   to the murder of the child.  Undoing the past is physically impossible
   (actually, metaphysically<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#8>8</A></SUP>); undoing the pregnancy is morally impossible.  We should, by our free choice, abide by the second as much as we
   are necessitated to abide by the first.

Abortion for rape is wrong because it destroys the innocent child.  It is also
   wrong because it is an assault on the woman.  It poses grave risks of harm
   to her, psychologically, physically, for possible future pregnancies, even
   for her life.  Women are the second victims of abortion, in addition to their
   murdered babies.  What is needed is a positive approach, of true understanding, loving support, and counseling.  Abortion is not a solution to the
   problem of rape - it destroys one person and poses grave dangers for
   another.

<P>        The case in favor of abortion following rape is based on the assumption that it would benefit the woman.  It would not be justified even if it did.
   That it poses, on the contrary, a grave threat to her provides an additional
   reason why abortion for rape is wrong.
       
<P> To illustrate the reality of what abortion can do to a woman, consider
   an actual case, the story of Holly (not her real name).  Her story is entitled,
   "I Had an Abortion: The Agonizing Aftermath."

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         I had an abortion 9- 1/2 years ago, at the age of 16.  Having an abortion
         has caused me great pain and I've always regretted not carrying my
         child to term....

<P>               The abortion itself was very traumatic emotionally.  I was put in
         a room on the maternity ward, next to the labor and delivery room
         where I heard a woman give birth.  When I was coming out of the
        anesthetic, I dreamt that the doctor could put my baby back inside me
        and I cried out to him to please give my baby back to me.

<P>              I received no counseling afterwards and no one asked me any
        questions about my feelings.  I left the hospital feeling very disoriented
        and confused.
       
<P>       I suffered greatly the next year and a half.  Every time I saw a
        baby, I would mourn the one I lost and feel intense guilt.
       
<P>       Shortly after my abortion, I saw pictures of 10-week-old fetuses
        in Life magazine, and became absolutely horrified at what I had done.
        I would fantasize about running away to Hawaii, when I was pregnant,
        to escape the pressure on me to abort.
       
<P>       After I graduated from high school, I was hospitalized for a few
        days for minor surgery and saw a 15-year-old girl I knew who had just
        delivered a baby she gave up for adoption.  I kept asking myself, "Why
        couldn't I have had my baby?" and almost had an emotional breakdown.
       
<P>       At that time, I told a priest my story and got some temporary relief
        from my guilt feelings.  After that, I made a conscious effort to repress
        the whole experience and used any means I could, including drug
        abuse, to dull my pain.
       
<P>       This past year, when I became pregnant with my son and felt him
        move inside me, the whole experience came back to me.  I was acutely
        conscious that I was carrying another person inside me and came to
        a full realization that I had allowed a child of mine to be killed inside
        my body.
       
<P>       I began to suffer horrible nightmares, insomnia, feelings of
        intense grief and guilt, and terror at what I had done.
       
<P>       I became clinically depressed, and my pain was so intense that
        I could hardly bear it.  My depression worsened after the birth of my
        son, and I eventually sought psychiatric care.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#9>9</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>        The story of Holly is typical of the devastating effects that an abortion
  can have on a woman.  In discussing this topic, I shall refer principally to
  the work of David C. Reardon, <EM>Aborted Women: Silent No More</EM>, the most
  comprehensive book on the subject, to my knowledge.  Reardon's basic
  thesis, that many women who have abortions suffer from them afterwards, is corroborated by numerous other works.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#10>10</A></SUP> Reardon's book is
  based on extensive research, including a detailed survey of 252 women
  who have had abortions, and are now members of WEBA, Women
  Exploited by Abortion, an organization formed to serve "as a refuge and
  source of spiritual and emotional healing for women who have had
  abortions" and "to educate the general public, and young women in
  particular, about the physical, emotional, and psychological side effects
  of abortion."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#11>11</A></SUP> One of Reardon's most significant findings is the following:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        If they had known where their lives would have been today, over 95
        percent of those surveyed said they would not have chosen abortion.
        Asked if their lives now are better or worse because of their choice, 66
        percent said that their lives are worse because of their abortions.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#12>12</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
        The claim that abortion is harmful to women has recently been
  challenged.  It has been claimed that most women do not suffer severe or
  long-term damage.  Even if "most" do not, <EM>some</EM> do, and that is very
  significant! Perhaps forty percent suffer, while most do not.  Perhaps only
  two percent suffer, in some categories.  If 20 million women have had
  abortions, two percent is 400,000, a very significant number.
       
<P> It is said that women feel a sense of relief after abortion.  That is
  understandable.  But the relief may mask deeper emotional scars (guilt,
  fear, anger, depression, feelings of loss).  The feeling of relief may be
  maintained by denial, and it may not last.  "Women.. . who suffer from
  abortion at a subconscious level are 'walking time-bombs,' waiting to
  explode over situations seemingly unrelated to their previous abortions."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#13>13</A></SUP>

<P>        Another aspect is the failure to consider long-term damage:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        An abortion recorded as complication-free in a short-term study might
        in fact have caused long-term damage.... Short term studies of
        abortion complications reveal only the tip of the iceberg.... Women
        who may appear physically unaffected by an abortion after a one year
        follow-up may be found to be severely effected by the abortion as many
        as ten to fifteen years later.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#14>14</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
        It is said that most women do not suffer lasting damage.  Or, they are
  not hospitalized.  But they may still suffer enormous pain at home.  They
  may go through what Karen Sullivan describes:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        I had nightmares and recurring dreams about my baby.  I couldn't
        work my job.  I just laid in my bed and cried.  Once, I wept so hard I
        sprained my ribs. . . . I was unable to walk on the beach because the
        playing children would make me cry.  Even the Pampers commercials
        would set me into fits of uncontrollable crying.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#15>15</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
        It is said that the data on the effects of abortion on women are
  insufficient.  True.  But that involves the frightening possibility that
  in some categories more woman may be suffering than reported.  What
   we know may be the tip of the iceberg.  There are a number of reasons
   for this:
       
<P>  Some women do not participate in surveys and studies because they
   are too deeply hurt.  Leaving them out creates an unrealistically positive
   picture. Some of those who do participate want to focus on the good part,
   the relief, they do not focus on their deeper feelings, the anguish, the guilt.
   Some may be in denial of these deeper sufferings.
       
<P>  Some complications which are in fact caused by abortion are not
   recognized as such because of lack of follow up examinations, because
   women hide their identities or deny they have had abortions, or because
   examinations that do occur do not trace complications back to their real
   source, the abortion.  This is especially true of long-term complications.
       
<P>  The data are insufficient because many women who suffer are never
   included in the statistics:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Accurate statistics are scarce because the reporting of complications
         is almost entirely at the option of abortion providers.  In other words,
         abortionists are in the privileged position of being able to hide any
         information which might damage their reputations or trade.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#16>16</A></SUP>

</FONT>
<P>
         The reason is a court mandated "Zone of Privacy":
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>
         This prohibits any meaningful form of state or federal regulation other
         than broad "general requirements as to the maintaining of sanitary
         facilities. . . ." As a result, any laws which attempt to require that
         deaths and complications resulting from abortion be recorded, much
         less reported, are unconstitutional.  Thus the only information available on abortion complications is the result of data which is <EM>voluntarily</EM>
         reported.  Since abortionists want to hide their failures, underreporting of complications is the rule rather than the exception.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#17>17</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>         What is unmistakably clear is that many women are hurting.  What
   we do not know are the precise figures: How many?  How severely?  For how
   long?  In what ways?  We know that smoking is hazardous to health, even
   if precise statistics and accurate predictions in specific cases are not
   available.  So it is with abortion.  It is a terrible hazard to the well-being of
   women.  To say that a particular woman has not suffered is to miss the
   point.  Perhaps she has not yet suffered.  Perhaps she is unaware of the
   root of her suffering in her abortion.  Perhaps she is denying her suffering.
   Assume she has not suffered at all, and will not suffer.  But many other
   women have suffered.  That is the important point here, a point that
   Reardon's book makes abundantly clear.  It is filled with facts and figures
   and their significance, and contains twenty-one stories of women devastated by their abortions, including that of Nancyjo Mann, founder of
   WEBA. These stories show that experiences like those of Holly are not
   isolated, but are tragedies repeated over and over again.

<P>         The conclusion is that abortion is a terrible risk for women.  As we
   shall see, the risk is especially great for the "hard cases" such as rape.  We
   have then another reason abortion for rape is wrong: it is a grave threat
   to the woman.
       
<P>  The following are some specific ways in which, abortion may be
   destructive to women.
       
<P>  First, psychological harm.  Reardon states:

       
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
  In a survey of available studies, the Royal College of Obstetricians and
         Gynecologists in England observed that, "The incidence of serious,
         permanent psychiatric aftermath [from abortion] is variously reported
         as between 9 and 59%." Naturally, the percentage is higher if one
         includes the "non-serious" and "non-permanent" aftermath.... A
         European study reported negative psychiatric manifestations following legal abortions in 55% of the women examined by the psychiatrists.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#18>18</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
         Another study showed 40% suffering from nightmares and 20% from
   nervous breakdowns.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#19>19</A></SUP>
       
<P>  Reardon reports on "one of the most detailed studies of post-abortion
   sequelae":

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         "[The women] ... were overwhelmed by negative feelings.  Even those
         women who were strongly supportive of the right to abort reacted to
         their own abortions with regret, anger, embarrassment, fear of
         disapproval and even shame." In another paper, the same group of
         psychiatrists reported that when detailed interviews were performed,
         <EM>every aborted woman, "without exception" experienced "feelings of
         guilt or profound regret</EM>... All the women felt that they had lost an
         important part of themselves."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#20>20</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
         Abortion is intended to help and strengthen women.  It may, in fact,
   do just the opposite. "Abortion often creates feelings of low self-esteem,
   feelings of having compromised values, having 'murdered my child,' and
   so on."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#21>21</A></SUP>
       
<P>  Second, abortion may cause physical harm.  In one study, fifty
   percent of the women suffered "from at least one type of physical
   complication" and eighteen percent "suffered permanent physical damage traceable to the procedure."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#22>22</A></SUP>


<P>         About ninety percent of all abortions are by suction, also known as
   vacuum aspiration.  "A major German study found that the total morbidity
   rate for vacuum aspiration abortions exceeded thirty-one percent."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#23>23</A></SUP>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Because the abortionist operates blindly, by sense of feel only, the
         cutting/suction device is potentially deadly.  Perforation of the uterus
         is one of the most common complications.... Another common complication results from failure to extract all the "products of conception.". . . Third, as with all forms of abortion, suction curettage results
         in a high incidence of embolisms.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#24>24</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
         Dilation and curettage (D & C) has complications similar to suction,
   but they are "approximately 20% more frequent."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#25>25</A></SUP> For later abortions
   things get worse.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Each year there are between 100,000 and 150,000 second and third
         trimester abortions.  Most of these are saline abortions.  The rate of
         "major" complications associated with saline abortion is reported to
         be about five times greater than for first trimester suction abortions.... In Japan, where abortion has been legalized since the 1940s, the
         saline abortion technique has been outlawed because it is "extraordinarily dangerous." Indeed in the United States saline abortion is
         second only to heart transplants as the elective surgery with the
         highest fatality rate.... Severe infections and hemorrhages are
         extremely common following saline abortions.  In addition, seepage of
         the salt solution into the woman's blood system may result in life-threatening coagulation problems.... Furthermore, infections or
         uterine damage incurred during saline abortions frequently require
         removal of the uterus.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#26>26</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
         Third, abortion may affect future pregnancies.  Abortion kills the
   child now present.  It threatens the woman.  A third potential victim is a
   wanted child from a later pregnancy.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Abortion poses a severe threat to the reproductive integrity of
         women.... Between 40 and 50 percent of all aborted women will suffer
         later reproductive problems.... It can be estimated that for every
         100,000 previously aborted women who later attempt a wanted
         pregnancy, 14,329 will lose their babies.  This is over four times the
         3,320 losses which would be expected for a group of 100,000 non-aborted women.  After subtracting out the "normal" fetal loss rate, it
         can be concluded that for every 100,000 pregnancies undertaken by
         previously aborted women, over 11,000 <EM>wanted</EM> babies will die as a
         direct result of latent abortion morbidity.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#27>27</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

          This danger is especially great for teenagers.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#28>28</A></SUP>
       
<P>   Fourth, legal abortions can lead to the woman's death.  Contrary to
   the familiar slogan, "safe, legal abortion," which so many people assume
   to be true, "a woman's supposedly simple surgery can become an ordeal
   of nightmare proportions."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#29>29</A></SUP>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          On June 14,1977, Barbaralee Davis underwent a routine suction
          abortion at the Hope Clinic for Women in Granite City, Illinois.  After
          the customary period of observation in the clinic's recovery room, she
          complained of  weakness and was sent home with instructions to rest.
          Alone in her bedroom, she slept and quietly bled to death.  Her body
          was found less than twelve hours after the abortion. After the incident
          was reported in the local press, Michael Grobsmith, chief of the Illinois
          Department of Public Health's Division of Hospitals and Clinics, commented on the death by saying: "It's unfortunate, but it's happening
          every day in Chicago, and you're just not hearing about it."

<P>               One year later, during an investigation of only four Chicago-based clinics (in a state with over twenty abortion clinics), the <EM>Chicago
          Sun-Times</EM> uncovered twelve abortion deaths that had never been
          reported.  Even when abortion-related deaths such as these are
          uncovered, they are generally not included in the "official" total since
          they were not reported as such on the original death certificates.  If
          there are this many unreported abortion deaths in one city from only
          a few clinics, in a state with regulations as strict as any allowed by the
          courts, how many more are there across the country?<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#30>30</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          The total number of deaths from legal abortion is unknown.  It is
   enough to know that they are occurring, and that every abortion poses a
   terrible risk of death for the woman.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          What should be clear is that there is a major flaw in the mortality
          statistics for legal abortion.  It is quite possible that only 5 to 10 percent
          of all deaths resulting from legal abortion are being reported as
          abortion-related.  Even if 50 percent were being accurately reported,
          that extra margin of risk is far greater than women are being led to
          believe. Indeed, based on the <EM>reported</EM> abortion deaths alone, abortion
          is already the fifth leading cause of maternal death in the United
          States.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#31>31</A></SUP>

<P></FONT>
          There is another threat to the woman's life:

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>
          For every 100,000 aborted women who later attempt a wanted
          pregnancy, 12 will die as a result of obstetric complications compared
          to a "normal" maternal mortality rate of 7.6 per 100,000 pregnancies.
          Thus, previously aborted women face a 58 percent greater risk of dying
          during a later pregnancy than their non-aborted sisters.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#32>32</A></SUP>

<P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
          The evidence shows that abortion is not safer than childbirth.
   Abortion makes future childbearing more dangerous.  It holds hazards for
   women: psychological, physical, even death.  These examples should
   make it clear that abortion is not safer than childbirth.  But let us look at
   some specific aspects of the comparison, both for complications following
   abortion and death from abortion:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          Compared to childbirth, the morbidity rate of abortion [i.e., the rate of
          complications following abortion] is astronomical.  For childbirth, the
          overall maternal morbidity rate is approximately 2 percent.... The
          reported immediate complication rate, alone, of abortion is no less
          than 10 percent.  In addition, studies of long-range complications
          show rates of no less than 17 percent and frequently report complication rates in the range of 25 to 40 percent.  One public hospital has
          even reported an overall complication rate following abortion of 70
          percent!<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#33>33</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          These figures are based on <EM>reported</EM> cases.  Many cases go unreported, meaning that actual morbidity rates are higher, perhaps much
   higher.  According to one report.  "the risk of long-term complications
   following an abortion is ten to twenty times greater than the risk of any
   complications following childbirth."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#34>34</A></SUP>
       
<P>   A careful study of the number of deaths resulting from childbirth and
   from abortion, was made by Thomas W. Hilgers,  M.D. and Dennis O'Hare,
   and reported in "Abortion Related Maternal Morbidity: An In-Depth
   Analysis." They first note that "traditional comparisons have been
   seriously flawed by comparing incomparable data.  In this study, adjustments have been made so that accurate reflections of the 'cases of
   pregnancy' can be made and compared."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#35>35</A></SUP>
       
<P>   They concluded: "In comparing the relative risk of natural pregnancy
   versus that of legal abortion, <EM>natural pregnancy was found to be safer in
   both the first and second 20 weeks of pregnancy</EM>."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#36>36</A></SUP>
       
<P>   These studies indicate that childbirth is safer for the woman.  When
   childbirth is dangerous, it is so because of an already present condition,
   while the dangers of abortion come from the abortion itself.  In this sense
   it is hardly fair to compare the two cases:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          The overwhelming majority of women who die from a legal abortion are
          perfectly healthy before their lethal surgery; in carrying the pregnancies to term few - if any - would die.  But most maternal childbirth
        deaths occur within a very small group of high-risk patients.  Those
        women who died in childbirth died from a disease process - an
        abnormality in the pregnancy/childbirth experience which for some
        reason could not be adequately treated.... The death of a healthy
        woman from a legal abortion is totally preventable simply by not
        aborting. . . . The death from childbearing of that woman with a
        disorder is mostly unpreventable because of medical inability to
        understand or control the disease process which takes her life.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#37>37</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
        Therefore, even if more women who carry the child to term were to
   die than those who abort, this would not show that abortion is safer than
   childbirth.  For the childbearing women who die do not die simply from
   childbearing but from already existing conditions in conjunction with
   their pregnancies.  In contrast, since the vast majority of aborting woman
   are healthy, if they die, their deaths must be attributed to the abortion and
   its consequences.
       
<P> Abortion can also make a future pregnancy more dangerous.  Hence
   some of the existing conditions that can make childbearing dangerous
   actually come from abortion, though the death of the woman would be
   counted under the childbirth statistics rather than abortion statistics.


   
<P><A NAME=Connection></A><EM>The Deep Connection</EM>


<P>   Abortion is wrong because it is the destruction of a child.  It is wrong
   because it is an assault on a woman.  There is a deep connection between
   these two.  The woman and the child, though absolutely distinct as
   individual persons, are nonetheless intimately joined together, not only
   physically but in a meaningful personal way.  The child is entrusted to her,
   sheltered and secured in her being.  She carries the child in herself
   Abortion is a violent attack on this intimate union.  The child is forcibly
   ripped out, against his instinctive clinging to remain in his secure resting
   place.  In this way, abortion is also an attack on the woman.  Such an
   attack is bound to take its toll, physically and psychologically.  That
   abortion is bad for women is what we should expect; it would be strange
   if it were not so.  When it seems not to be, when women say they are better
   off having had an abortion, one wonders whether this optimism does not
   mask a deeper hidden wound.  Sometimes they realize it later, as Nancyjo  Mann did: "The abortion killed not only my daughter; it killed a part
   of me."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#38>38</A></SUP>

There is a risk for all women who abort, but especially for those who do
       so in the "hard" cases, such as rape.  Reardon says such women "are much
       more likely to suffer from severe emotional and psychiatric stress after
       their abortion than are those who abort purely for reasons of convenience."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#39>39</A></SUP> In general: "<EM>The more difficult the circumstances prompting
       abortion the more likely it is that the woman will suffer severe post-abortion sequelae</EM>."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#40>40</A></SUP> This is supported by an official statement from the
       World Health Organization that reads: "Thus the very women for whom
       legal abortion is considered justified on psychiatric grounds are the ones
       who have the highest risk of post-abortion psychiatric disorders."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#41>41</A></SUP>

<P>            Reardon also notes.  "Within all of the psychiatric literature available,
       there is not one psychiatric condition for which abortion is a recognized
       cure.  Instead, the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that true psychological problems are generally complicated and aggravated by abortion
       rather than alleviated by it."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#42>42</A></SUP>

	Real Problem and Its Solution
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

What we have just seen - that abortion for rape is especially threatening
       to women - makes it clear that abortion is the wrong solution to the
       problem of rape pregnancy.  It is the wrong solution because the problem
       is misunderstood.  The problem is not the child, carrying her to term.  The
       problem is the effect on the woman of attitudes projected on her by others.

<P>            These attitudes are rooted in the valid response of abhorrence at the
       rape.  But then they are extended to a kind of abhorrence of the woman
       herself, and her child.  A stigma is attached, somewhat like that in
       Hawthorne's novel, <EM>The Scarlet Letter</EM>, where a woman was stigmatized by
       her society by having to wear a large "A" because of her sin of adultery.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#43>43</A></SUP>
       The stigma in the case of rape pregnancy "is that the woman is somehow
       'tainted' or 'dirtied' as a result of her tragic experience."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#44>44</A></SUP> There is also an
       assumption that the woman was somehow responsible, that she must
       have provoked the attack and could have prevented it: that "nice women
       don't get raped."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#45>45</A></SUP> The result is a strong desire to get rid of the whole thing,
       to push it out of sight.  There is an obvious way to do this: get rid of the
       visible sign of rape; abort the child.
       
<P>     Mahkorn expresses the real problem.  It is "that the attitudes
       projected by others and not the pregnancy itself pose the central problem
       for the pregnant   victim."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#46>46</A></SUP>

      
<P>The absurdity and injustice of these attitudes and assumptions
   cannot be too strongly condemned.  The woman must be seen only as an
   innocent victim.  Just as a child who is a victim of child abuse is not tainted
   or dirtied by that despicable deed, so a woman is not affected in this way.
   By its very nature, rape is something forced on the woman, precluding her
   responsibility.  Rape is rape, an unspeakable crime, regardless of what
   leads to it.  And, nice women do get raped.
       
<P>We should also note that part of the problem for a woman is the
   pressure to abort.  This tends to aggravate her problems: "Because it is
   likely that the victim already harbors feelings of guilt as a result of the
   assault, medico-social pressures which encourage and result in abortion
   could compound the woman's feelings of guilt and self-blame."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#47>47</A></SUP>
       
<P>Another part of the problem is the suggestion that the woman needs
   an abortion.  Such an attitude "can only serve to reaffirm the sense of
   helplessness and vulnerability that was so violently conveyed in the act
   of sexual assault itself.  At a time when she is struggling to regain her sense
   of self-esteem, such a 'take charge' attitude can be especially damaging."&nbsp;<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#48>48</A></SUP>
       
<P>What is needed is not the negative attempt to get rid of an embarrassment but a positive approach: support and encouragement for the
   woman, based on a total affirmation of her, in her present situation, with
   no shade of stigma, accusation, or condescension.  An important part of
   this is encouraging her to face her situation realistically, and to talk about
   it. That is, we must "recognize that the victim    ...  [has] a real need to
   discuss her feelings and fears with people who     ...  [care] about her."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#49>49</A></SUP>
       
<P>The negative feelings projected by others may be transferred to the
   child, who is then seen as something that should be removed.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#50>50</A></SUP> To
   understand the real problem allows us to become free from the impulse
   to remove the child, who is also an innocent victim of these negative
   feelings.
       
<P> In a typical rape case, the woman is the first innocent victim, a victim
   of the attacker.  Then she is an innocent victim a second time, a victim of
   the attitudes of others that stigmatize her.  The child is also drawn in, and
   becomes another innocent victim in this tragic scenario.  If an abortion is
   performed, the child is again an innocent victim.  Abortion for rape does
   not help - it only adds another innocent victim.
       
<P> The real problem is not the child but the social stigma unjustly
   suffered by the woman.  This helps us to understand why abortion for rape
   is especially bad for women.  The woman, already weakened and devastated by the assault of the rapist, now becomes subject to another assault
   on her body and spirit, the assault by the abortionist.  If she is pressured
   to have an abortion the assault is compounded.  She may feel that
   abortion is wrong, but that she must have one to please others or do what
  they insist is the right thing.  In this way she is again a victim of something
  forced on her by outside forces.  Already made to feel vulnerable by the
  rapist, she is now made to feel vulnerable by the pressure to abort:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Abortion promises only to compound the trauma of rape with yet
         another experience of violence.  In pursuing this course, the victim
         may assume to herself guilt for the entire episode.  In an attempt to
         overcome the violation of her own person, she does violence to
         another, submitting to the added humiliation of abortion.  This brings
         no peace of mind and no healing only more pain and more regret.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#51>51</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
         The negative social stigma also explains why there is such widespread support for abortion in cases of rape, and why it is so strong.  Pro-abortion people consider it one of their strongest arguments, implying
  that any compassionate person must favor abortion in such cases.  Many
  people (probably a majority) who oppose abortion as such, feel impelled
  to make an exception for rape.  They mean to do well for the woman;
  tragically, what they advocate hurts not only the child but the woman as
  well.
       
<P>  The only positive alternative to abortion is support for the woman as
  she deals with the trauma of her experience, and as she carries the child
  to term.  As Mahkorn puts it, "the central issue" is not abortion "but rather
  an exploration of the things we can change in ourselves and through
  community education to support such women through their pregnancies."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#52>52</A></SUP>

<P>
         Curt Young summarizes these points:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         The emotional trauma of rape is not mitigated by abortion.  Regardless
         of what the woman does once she is pregnant, she must work through
         her rape experience and her feelings about it in order to resolve the
         trauma.  This does not come easily and may involve professional counseling.  There is no shortcut to coming to grips with the pain.  From a
         counseling perspective, abortion is a simplistic and presumptuous
         suggestion.... In the course of choosing life and sacrificing for the
         child within them, women have regained their self-esteem and acquired a sense of their own worth they never before possessed.  In the
         midst of their pain they have discovered a peace they never imagined
         was possible.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#53>53</A></SUP>

<P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
  
<P><A NAME=Incest></A><EM>Abortion for Incest</EM>


<P>  The first and basic moral argument against abortion for rape applies to
  cases of incest as well.  If we realize that a child is present, if we identify
  with her, if we have full and equal concern for the mother and child, if we
  realize that we cannot kill one innocent person to try to benefit another,
  that we cannot do wrong to try to achieve good, then we will see clearly
  that abortion for incest is absolutely wrong; a clear-cut wrong, and not a
  legitimate exception.

<P>        The second major argument against abortion for rape - that abortion
  is an assault on the woman, that it is counterproductive, largely because
  it is based on a false picture of the actual problem - applies here as well.
  Reardon's argument is along these lines, and he adds certain features
  specific to incest pregnancies.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          As with rape, abortion proponents appealed to emotional abhorrence
          of incest to gain support for abortion while ignoring the real needs of
          the victims.  Abortion was simply <EM>presumed</EM> to be the best answer -
          at least best for society if not for the women, girls or children.  Through
          abortion, they suggested, we could cover up these embarrassing
          victims of our sick society; we could destroy the "unclean" offspring of
          our sexual perversions.  But in fact, just as with rape, there is no
          psychiatric evidence, nor even any theory which argues that abortion
          of an incestuous pregnancy is therapeutic for the victim - it is only
          more convenient for everyone else.

<P>               Setting aside the paternalistic attitudes with which society presumes that abortion is best for the incest victim, we must ask what do
          these girls themselves want? ... Almost all incest victims actually
          desire to keep the baby, and the majority do! Those who do abort do
          so under pressure from the impregnating relative who is seeking to
          cover-up his crime, and even in these cases, the victims abort only
          with resentment.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#54>54</A></SUP>
       
<P>        Abortion of an incestuous pregnancy ... not only adds to the
          girl's guilt and trauma, it also frustrates her plans for escape and
          attention.  Abortion perpetuates the "conspiracy of silence" by covering up the incest, or at least its results, and continues the family
          pattern of denying reality.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#55>55</A></SUP>
       
<P>        The problem the pregnant incest victim faces is not the pregnancy, it is the psychological pain of incest.  Again, as with rape, it is
          the discrimination and superstitions of those around her which make
          the pregnancy difficult, not the pregnancy itself.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#56>56</A></SUP>

<P></FONT>
          Dr. George Maloof speaks in the same vein:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
          Whatever else we may be doing by an abortion of an incestuous
          pregnancy, we are promoting mental illness by not allowing the girl to
          accept the consequences of her own acts . . . Accepting the
          pregnancy can be the first step to accepting the incest and making the
          changes to alter the family pattern so that it can be more productive
          rather than withholding and destructive.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#57>57</A></SUP>

<P><A NAME=Health></A><EM>   The Health and Life of the Woman</EM>


<P>   Is abortion justified when it is deemed necessary for preserving the health
   or life of the woman?  Cases where the woman's health or life is threatened
   by pregnancy are now extremely rare, perhaps so rare as to be virtually
   non-existent.  For example:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         According to one obstetrician, "After many years' work in several large
         gynecological hospitals, I have never yet seen a woman's life in danger,
         necessitating abortion." In contrast, he adds, "I have seen two extremely sick women offered abortions because of serious heart-lung disease: both refused, and both delivered normal children,    normally... Similarly, Dr. David Decker of the Mayo Clinic states that
         there are "few, if any, absolute medical indications for the therapeutic
         abortion in the present state of medicine."<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#58>58</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
         Despite the rarity of such cases, the question of abortion as it
   pertains to them is worth pursuing, as there are important principles
   involved.  Such cases, though rare in practice, are not so rare in the
   discussion of the abortion issue.  Hence, an understanding of the principles involved is of great importance.
       
<P>  To evaluate such cases, I suggest the following three principles.  The
   first two have already been noted.
       
<P><OL><LI>There must be full and equal concern for all persons involved, the
   woman and the child.  Each is fully a person, each has the same dignity
   and preciousness of being a person; each has the same right to live as the
   other.  What applies to one applies equally to the other.  Just as we
   recognize the full reality of the woman, so too we must recognize the full
   reality of the child.  Just as we identify with the woman, we must identify
   with the child.

<P><LI>We cannot kill innocent person B to save person A. Thus the
   fundamental point: We cannot kill the child to save the woman, any more
   than we could kill the woman to save the child.  Parallel to the case of
"abortion for rape," there are people who are fundamentally opposed to
   abortion, who recognize it as wrong, but who want to make an exception
   for "the life of the woman." But if abortion is murder, one cannot commit
   murder to save the life of another person.

<P><LI>Where complications arise, we must try to save both the woman
   and the child.  Dr. Everett Koop describes this situation:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         When a woman is pregnant, her obstetrician takes on the care of two
         patients - the mother-to-be and the unborn baby. If, toward the end
         of the pregnancy, complications arise that threaten the mother's
         health, he will take the child by inducing labor or performing a
         Caesarean section.

<P>              His intention is still to save the life of both the mother and the
         baby.  The baby will be premature and perhaps immature depending
         on the length of gestation.  Because it has suddenly been taken out of
         the protective womb, it may encounter threats to its survival.  The baby
         is never willfully destroyed because the mother's life is in danger.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#59>59</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
</OL><P>
         What is crucial in such cases is that no one is killed.  One person is
   saved, the other person would be saved if that were possible. Tragically,
   it is not.  So, one saves one person and regretfully fails to save the other.
   The other is not killed.  To apply a medical procedure to person A instead
   of to B - where both need it to survive but where it can be given only to
   one - is to save A, and to unwillingly withhold treatment from B. Unwillingly withholding treatment, in such a situation, differs sharply from
   doing something that kills.  So, if it is the child who is to be saved,
   treatment is unwillingly withheld from the woman, but she is not killed.
   Conversely, if it is the woman who is to be saved, treatment is unwillingly
   withheld from the child, but he is not killed.  No abortion is performed.  To
   withhold treatment from the child - because it cannot be given both to
   him and to the woman, and the woman is selected instead - is not to abort
   the child.
       
<P>  If two people are bitten by a poisonous snake and I have an antidote
   serum for one but not for the other, I give it to one and withhold it from
   the other.  I regretfully cannot save him but must let him die.  I have not
   killed him.  So too with the mother and child.
       
<P>  Difficult situations failing under these principles typically involve
   removal of the child.  What kinds of "removal" are justified, and what kinds
   are not?
       
<P><OL><LI>We may remove the child to save the woman, even if the child dies
   as a result.  A typical case is the removal of the child in an ectopic
   pregnancy, where she begins to develop in the fallopian tube instead of
   in the uterus.  If nothing is done, both mother and child will die.  Clearly
   it is right to remove the child in order to save the mother.  What is intended
   is only her removal, not her death.  And the method of removal is not one
   that actually constitutes killing, but is genuine removal.  Death follows as
   a result of the moving, it is clearly not intended.  A similar situation occurs
   when a child is removed from a cancerous womb in order to save the
   woman, even though the child's death is foreseen.

<P><LI>We may remove the child to save the child, if his death is otherwise
   certain, even if there is a risk to the mother.  Just as we may remove the
   child to save the mother, if her death is otherwise certain, even if there is
   a risk to the child.

        
<P><LI>The primary kind of "removal" that is not justified is an action that
  is in fact the killing of the child but labeled "removal." Thus suction, where
  the child is torn to pieces, is a form of removal (as are all the other
  methods).  The removal is accomplished by means of the suction.  But the
  act of suctioning is itself the act of killing.  Such acts of removal are really
  acts of murder.  Abortion is that kind of act.

<P>        Removal, to be justified, must be genuine removal.  It cannot be a de
  facto killing, which is then labeled "removal."
       
<P><LI>Another kind of removal that is not justified is the case in which
  it means the certain death of one person (as an unintended result), while
  it only increases the chance of life for another.  We cannot remove a sick
  child to increase his chances of life if doing so would result in the certain
  death of the woman.  So too, we cannot remove a child to increase the
  chance of life for his mother, if doing so would result in his certain death.
</OL>
<P>        It is extremely important to be clear about these matters, specifically
  the three principles and the justified and unjustified forms of removal.
  The failure to be clear on these things accounts for the fact that a large
  majority of people who see the wrongness of abortion for all the reasons
  indicated here, nevertheless want to make an exception for the life of the
  woman.  They fail to distinguish clearly between justified removals -
  where no one's death is intended - and abortion, which is intentional
  killing.  Or they fail to see that not saving the child - because both cannot
  be saved, and one tries to save the woman - is radically different from
  killing the child by abortion.  If one wants to save the woman (instead of
  the child), and one is not clear about these things, confusing them with
  abortion, one is likely to consider these procedures forms of abortion, and
  thus to favor abortion when necessary to save the life of the woman.
       
<P> The view defended here is not, as so often charged, an extreme view.
  It is simply the result of a careful analysis of such cases by applying the
  two basic principles that all persons are to count equally, and that we may
  not kill one innocent person to save the life of another.
       
<P> It is noteworthy that the United States Supreme Court, in the
  decision that legalized abortion (<EM>Roe v. Wade</EM>, January 22, 1973), recognized the inconsistency in saying that abortion is wrong as such, but right
  if necessary to save the life of the woman.  The Court was considering a
  Texas law that prohibited abortion but included an exception for the life
  of the woman.  The Texas law said "a fetus is entitled to Fourteenth
  Amendment protection as a person." The Court then noted: "But if the
  fetus is a person who is not to be deprived of life without due process of
  law, and if the mother's condition is the sole determinant, does not the
  Texas exception appear to be out of line with the Amendment's command?"<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#60>60</A></SUP>

<P>        One may not kill the child to save the woman when this benefit to her
  is a certainty; still less when it falls short of that, and even less when the
  abortion killing may actually be more dangerous for her.  Reardon,
  speaking of "cases where the mother is suffering from other maladies,
  such as heart or kidney disease, which <EM>may</EM> worsen as the pregnancy
  progresses," and where the "death of the mother is only a possibility
  rather than a certainty," explains:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        The vast majority of these diseased women, if not aborted, will survive
        and carry their pregnancies successfully to term.  Furthermore, since
        these women are already weakened by disease, they are also more
        susceptible to complications associated with abortion.  Though childbirth poses extra risks for these women, so does abortion.  In many
        such cases it has been found that "therapeutic" abortions are in fact
        far more dangerous than childbirth.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#61>61</A></SUP>

Defenders of abortion sometimes appeal to the right to kill in self-defense
  in cases such as those in this chapter, especially when it is the life of the
  woman that is threatened. The child is viewed as an attacker who may be
  killed in defense of the woman.  Judith Jarvis Thomson advances such an
  argument:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        Suppose you find yourself trapped in a tiny house with a growing
        child.  I mean a very tiny house, and a rapidly growing child - you are
        already up against the wall of the house and in a few minutes you'll
        be crushed to death.  The child on the other hand won't be crushed to
        death; If nothing is done to stop him from growing he'll be hurt, but
        in the end he'll simply burst open the house and walk out a free man.
        Now I could well understand it if a bystander were to say, "There's
        nothing we can do for you.  We cannot choose between your life and his,
        we cannot be the ones who decide who is to live, we cannot intervene."
        But it cannot be concluded that you too can do nothing, that you
        cannot attack it to save your life.  However innocent the child may be,
        you do not have to wait passively while it crushes you to death.
        Perhaps a pregnant woman is vaguely felt to have the status of house,
        to which we don't allow the right of self-defense.  But if the woman
        houses the child, it should be remembered that she is a person who
        houses it.<SUP><A HREF=notes10.htm#62>62</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
        When does a person have a right to kill another person in self-defense?  I submit there are three necessary conditions.  There is a right
     to kill only: (1) In cases of extremely serious threat, such as the threat of
     murder. (2) If there is no other alternative. (3) Against an aggressor, an
     unjust attacker who is doing something to threaten me.

<P>          Regarding (1): I cannot, for example, kill a car thief in order to
     protect the possession of my car.  There is a question about very serious
     threats short of life such as permanent paralysis or blindness or rape.
     They may or may not qualify, a difficult question we cannot pursue
     here.
       
<P>   Regarding (2): If I can escape, or distract my assailant, or temporarily
     disable him, or call the police, I must, of course, do so.  Killing can only
     be a last resort.
       
<P>   Let us focus now on (3), the most significant of these necessary
     conditions, and the one most often overlooked.  The crucial point is
     this.  I cannot kill another person merely because he is in some way
     causing my death, or is a causal factor involved in my impending
     death.  I cannot, so to speak, push people out of the way by killing them
     if they block the continuation of my life.  I can kill them only if they
     are unjustly attacking me.  To make this clear consider the following
     two cases:
       
<P>   Case A: A man attacks me, intending to kill me.  I can save myself only
     by killing him.  I kill him.
       
<P>   Case B: I'm fleeing for my life.  An innocent man, not doing anything,
     blocks my way, without realizing it.  I can get him out of the way only by
     killing him.  If I do not kill him, I will be killed.  Again: I can save myself only
     by killing him.  I kill him.
       
<P>   I submit that I have no right to kill the innocent man in case B, while
     I do have the right to kill the unjust aggressor in case A. Why?  Both are
     instances of "I can save myself only by killing him.  I kill him." The crucial
     difference is that in case A, a person is attacking me unjustly and
     threatening my life, while in case B the other person involved is not an
     attacker, and his behavior is not unjust.  I have a right to kill in self-defense against an unjust attacker, an aggressor, but not against
     someone who is merely a causal factor in my death.  The fact that another
     person is, or is about to be, a causal factor in my death - perhaps even the
     main cause - is not sufficient to justify killing him in self-defense.  The
     person who represents a threat to me must be more than a causal factor.
     He must be doing something to threaten my life, and he must be doing it
     unjustly.  The injustice of his behavior is an essential element in the
     justification of killing in self-defense. The right to kill in self-defense is
     essentially a response to the injustice of what another is doing that
     threatens my life; not merely the fact that his behavior, or his presence,
     somehow contributes to, or causes my death.

<P>      We may have great compassion for the person in case B who kills
 someone, to save his own life.  We would not want to judge the person
 harshly. but this does not mean that his act was morally justified.
      
<P>Suppose we deny this third necessary condition.  It would mean that
 I have a right to kill you in self-defense in the following situations: (C) I
 need a life-sustaining machine, but you are using the only one available.
 I push you out of my way, since you are blocking my use of it, thereby
 killing you. (D) We are trapped in a wreck, I am under you, your weight
 (through no fault of your own) is suffocating me, I have a device that
 pushes you out of my way," thereby killing you. (Note the similarity to
 Thomson's rapidly growing child.) (E) I am trapped in a cave where I will
 soon die, because you are blocking its entrance through no fault of your
 own.  I "push you out of my way" by dynamiting you.
     
<P> I submit that in all these cases I have no right to kill you to save
 myself.  It is wrong to kill one innocent person to save another.  Killing in
 defense in each of these cases would violate this important principle.
 Innocent in these instances means simply not unjustly attacking.  In each
 of these cases, the person about to cause a death, or causally involved in
 such a process, is not unjustly attacking.  He just happens to be in a
 position where his presence represents something that causes (or is a
 causal factor in) the death of another.  It is not his fault, in contrast to the
 unjust attack of a real aggressor.
      
<P>The no duty-nonforcing principle also makes the wrongness of
 killing in each of these cases clear.  Since you have no duty to give up your
 life so that mine can be saved, no one can force you to give up your life.
 No one may kill you.  Also, there is no duty that you are failing to live up
 to in any of these cases, a duty that might justify someone forcing you to
 live up to.  This is precisely what is not true of the unjust attacker: Since
 he is failing to live up to his duty to respect my life, I may force him to do
 so by protecting myself against him, even if it means causing his death.
      
<P>Abortion in the name of self-defense is not justified.  The child is not
 an unjust attacker.  He is not doing anything, especially not something
 unjust.  He is simply in his natural place, developing and growing.  If, in
 a particular situation, this has adverse causal effects on the woman, it is
 a terrible tragedy.  But it is not an unjust attack, and so it does not justify
 killing in defense.
      
<P>An important point that emerges especially from cases D and E is
 that the right to self-defense never applies when the cause of (or a causal
 factor in) my impending death is merely the body of another, and not that
 person as agent. The right to self-defense applies only when someone who
 threatens to do something to me acts as a personal agent, however
     irrationally.  He may use his body, as when he threatens severe blows with
     his fists.  But <EM>he</EM> is attacking me, not his body: though he attacks me by
     means of parts of his body.  In contrast, where it is merely the body of
     another that becomes a cause of my death - as in the previous cases, or
     the child in the womb - I have no right to kill in self-defense.
       
<P>   Regarding Thomson's analogy, we can now see that she has no right
     to kill the growing child inside her, since that child is absolutely innocent.
     The same is true if the tables are turned.  If a growth in the woman's body
     were about to crush the child, and he realized it, and could kill his mother
     to save himself, he would not be morally justified in doing so.  For his
     mother is not an unjust aggressor.
       
<P>   Thomson will say that the two cases are not parallel; that, after all,
     the body is hers; the house in which the baby is crushing the woman is
     her house.  But this does not alter the moral situation with regard to the
     right to kill in self-defense.  I cannot kill you, an innocent person who is
     merely causing my death, even if this is taking place in my own house.  A
     woman's right to her body, however far it may or may not extend, does not
     include the right to kill an innocent person.
       
<P>   Thomson's admission that she "could well understand it if a bystander were to say, 'there's nothing we can do for you.  We cannot choose
     between your life and his.... we cannot intervene,'" is revealing.  She is
     perfectly right.  A bystander couldn't intervene because the child is
     innocent, a non-aggressor.  If he weren't, the situation would be essentially different.  In general, if A were an unjust aggressor threatening to kill
     B, then surely the bystander could, and should, intervene.  He could kill
     A under the heading of the right to kill an aggressor in defense.  That right
     applies both to the defense of another and oneself.
       
<P>   The fact that the bystander has no right to intervene to kill the child
     reflects the central point here: The child is innocent, he is not an
     aggressor, and so he may not be killed.
       
<P>   The bystander may not kill the child because he should not be killed,
     which of course means the woman may not kill him either.  And Thomson's
     tiny house argument fails.  A woman may not kill a growing child inside
     her (her house or her body) even to save her own life.
       
<P>   The self-defense argument for abortion fails.  Virtually all pregnancies fail the first or second necessary condition, or both. (1) They are not
     life threatening, and those that are very serious are debatable in terms of
     their meeting the first condition. (2) Killing the child is not the only
     alternative.  A woman can successfully carry her child to term; in fact,
     killing the child is sometimes more harmful for the woman, as the last
     quotation from Reardon indicates.


       
<P>Most importantly, even if the first two conditions are met (something
  that virtually never occurs). the third condition is not met: the child is
  innocent.

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

Abortion is usually thought of as a procedure to benefit the woman.  But
    it is also advocated in the name of benefiting the child and others, for the
    sake of benefiting the family and society.  For the child, there are basically
    three arguments: (1) "Every child should be a wanted child.  We should not
    bring an unwanted child into the world." (2) "Abortion is justified as a
    preventive measure against child abuse." (3) "We should not bring a
    defective child into the world."

	<P>

It is argued: "Every child should be a wanted child.  We should not bring
    an unwanted child into the world.  It is not fair to him; he is better off if
    he is not born.  He will have a miserable life, rejected by his parents,
    unloved.  For his own sake, he should be spared such a life.  Abortion, in
    such cases, is the merciful termination of a pregnancy that, if continued,
    will result in an unloved, miserably unhappy child.  Abortion is the only
    humane thing to do in such a case."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#1>1</A></SUP>

<P>         We must certainly have the greatest sympathy for a child who is
    unloved and rejected.  We should do all in our power to alleviate her
    suffering.  We should love her in a special way, and try, as far as possible,
    to make up for the love she has not received.  These are the things we
    should do - not kill her by an abortion.
       
<P>  "We should not bring an unwanted child into the world." But the
    child in the womb is already in the world! The womb is part of the world.
    It is a part of the woman's body, and she is surely in the world.  What is
    in the womb is just as much already in the world as the womb itself.  Thus,
  the child in the womb is as much here as her mother.  She is merely not
  visible to us, and we cannot interact with her.  And so we overlook her.  But
  she is as real, and as present, as the rest of us.

<P>       As noted in the previous chapter, one cannot kill innocent person B
  for the sake of benefiting person A. The same is true when B is the
  supposed beneficiary.  We cannot kill B for the sake of B. The obligation
  to not kill a person clearly overrides the obligation to benefit a person.
       
<P>A child unwanted in his preborn phase may become wanted later.
  How many times have we heard of women with unplanned pregnancies,
  on the one hand considering abortions, on the other hand rejecting the
  idea of keeping the baby now and then giving him up for adoption after
  birth? The same child, unwanted as a baby in the womb, will then be very
  much wanted when he has emerged from the womb, when he can be seen
  and touched, when it is psychologically easier to identify with him.  This
  is especially true when it is the pregnancy that is unwanted, and when the
  child is called "unwanted" because of this.  There is evidence to suggest
  that "most women who are refused abortion will be glad that they carried
  the pregnancy to term."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#2>2</A></SUP>
       
<P>A child unwanted by his natural mother even after his birth may be
  wanted by others eager to adopt him.  Thousands of couples would like to
  adopt babies.  So few are available, and usually only after a very long
  waiting period.  How tragic that at the same time a million and a half or
  more are slaughtered each year by abortion!
       
<P>Can a disabled child be given up for adoption?  There is a program
  called IMPACT, Innovative Matching of Parents And Children Together,
  which "places 'hard to place' children, many with multiple handicaps
  such as mobility impairments, hearing or vision loss, or mental retardation in adoptive or foster families."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#3>3</A></SUP> These are parents who have "chosen
  to raise disabled children."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#4>4</A></SUP> Marsha Saxton, meeting with these parents
  says, "What struck me was that the usual feeling of 'burden' seemed
  consistently to be replaced with a sense of challenge to find solutions.... To the IMPACT parents, their disabled children served as a
  source of enrichment, growth, challenge, joy."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#5>5</A></SUP>
       
<P>Suppose, despite this, that the child remains unwanted and unhappy.  Even then the argument for abortion does not hold.  For it says we
  should kill preborn children who will be unwanted or unhappy.  Should
  we then not also kill other children who are unwanted?  If, as the pro-abortion reasoning assumes, killing the preborn child who will be
  unwanted is doing him a favor by sparing him a life of misery, why not
  grant this favor also to other children?  If preborn persons should be killed
  to save them from a life of misery, the same logic should apply also to post-born persons.

       <P> If there seems to be a difference between killing an unwanted born
   person and abortion, it is, I think, largely because of the assumption that
   we should not bring an unwanted child into the world.  To regain our
   perspective we have only to remember that the child in the womb is
   already in the world.
       
<P> Perhaps an unwanted child would not want to continue living.
   Perhaps he would decide that life in his particular condition is not worth
   living.  It is one thing if he decides this for himself, it is quite another if
   we decide this for him, if we impose this awesome life and death
   decision on him.  How dare we force such a decision on the child, the
   irreversible decision that a life in an unhappy state is a life not worth
   living!
       
<P> The person recommending abortion in such cases should ask
   himself how he would feel if someone else forced such a decision on him.
   He would want his autonomy respected.  He would claim the right to make
   such a decision himself. The child's autonomy should also be respected,
   as well as his right to decide.  Why is he not allowed to live until he is
   capable of making his own decision?
       
<P> Many persons who suffered through an unhappy childhood find
   happiness, meaning, and fulfillment later in life, through creativity, love,
   and many other things.  The present argument for abortion assumes that
   an unwanted child will be an unhappy person.  This is an unwarranted
   assumption, and when it is removed, the pro-abortion argument collapses.
       
<P> The term <EM>unwanted</EM> seems to be an adjective modifying <EM>child</EM>.  It is
   not. The child does not change her characteristics if she is first unwanted
   then wanted, or the reverse.  We change.  We should change from
   unwanting to wanting people.
       
<P> So the whole problem of the unwanted child is our problem.  There
   is nothing wrong with an unwanted child, no reason why she should be
   destroyed.  There is very much of a problem with unwanting parents and
   an unwanting society.  The changes that are called for to solve this
   problem are changes in us, not changes in the so-called unwanted child,
   from being alive to being destroyed.
       
<P> There is no such thing as an unwanted child - there are only
   unwanting people among those who are born.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#6>6</A></SUP>

	Abortion and Child Abuse

	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

It is argued: "Abortion is necessary to prevent, or at least to minimize, the
   terrible evil of child abuse.  Anyone who has ever witnessed the absolute
   horror of child abuse cannot but wish that such a child had never been
   born."

<P>          As in the previous type of case, we must have the greatest sympathy
   for a child who is a victim of child abuse.  We must do all we can to stop
   this abomination.  But to kill the child before he is born?
       
<P>   First, abortion is not a solution for child abuse, because abortion is
   itself the ultimate child abuse! Recall what has been continually emphasized, the horror of the methods of abortion, such as saline burning of the
   skin for one to two hours or cutting the child to pieces, and the pain these
   methods cause to the child.  Even by other "clean and painless" methods,
   abortion would still be child abuse because all murder is a form of abuse.
       
<P>   Second, abortion is not a solution for child abuse.  It is simply false
   to assume that it is the unwanted child who will be abused while the
   wanted child will not.  That is, abortion for this purpose, even if it were
   justified, would not be effective.  "Many studies have demonstrated that
   the victim of child abuse is <EM>not</EM> the 'unwanted child.'"<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#7>7</A></SUP> It IS the wanted
   child.  In his study of child abuse, Edward F. Lenoski, M.D., found that
   "91% of the parents admitted they wanted the child they had abused. The
   mothers had also donned maternity clothing two months earlier than
   most expectant mothers."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#8>8</A></SUP> Furthermore: "A higher percentage of the
   abused children were named after one of the parents,"<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#9>9</A></SUP> indicating that
   they were wanted.
       
<P>   Third, there is another compelling reason why abortion is not a
   solution for child abuse. "Instead of reducing the incidence of child abuse,
   the evidence shows that abortion actually <EM>increases</EM> child abuse."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#10>10</A></SUP> There
   are a number of reasons for this:

<P><OL><LI>The abused child is reduced to an object.

       
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
   The abortion mentality reinforces the attitude of treating children like
          objects, objects that can be wanted or unwanted according to whether
          or not "it" satisfies parental needs ... What aborters and abusers have
          in common. . . is "the assumption that the rights, desires, and ideas
          of the adult take full precedence over those of the child, and that
          children are essentially the property of parents who have the right to
          deal with their offspring as they see fit, without interference."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#11>11</A></SUP>

<P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><LI>The abused child is a victim of the result of guilt.  "Aborted women
   frequently feel guilt, and 'guilt is one of the major factors causing battering
   and infanticide.' This guilt results in 'intolerable feelings of self-hatred,
   which the parent takes out on the child."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#12>12</A></SUP>

<P><LI>The abused child is a victim of the result of lowered self-esteem.
   "Child abusers almost invariably have a significant lack of self-esteem.  Since lowered self-esteem is a well-documented aftermath of
   abortion, the experience of abortion may help shape an emotional
   environment which is conducive to the battering of other or later
   children."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#13>13</A></SUP>

<P>          Lenoski states that if the mother sees a resemblance of herself in
   her child. and if "the mother has very little self-esteem, she will see in
   the baby a reflection of the low self-esteem she feels toward herself,"<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#14>14</A></SUP>
   making the child a potential victim of the bad feelings the mother has for
   herself.
       
<P><LI>The abused child is a victim of the result of failures in bonding.  Dr.
   Philip C. Ney, an authority on child abuse, explains:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          It would appear that those who abort their infants at any stage of
          pregnancy interrupt a very delicate mechanism and sever the developing bond that is critical for the infant's protection against the
          mother's carelessness or rage.  It is hypothesized that, once bonding
          is interrupted in the primipara, there are long-lasting psychological
          changes which make it more difficult for the same bond to develop in
          subsequent pregnancies.  For this reason, it is likely that abortion
          contributes to bonding failure, an important cause of child battering.
          Consequently, as rates of abortion increase, rates of battering will
          increase proportionately.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#15>15</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
       <LI>The abused child is a victim of the results of marital stress.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          The marital stress caused by abortion increases family hostilities and
          thus heightens the possibility of violent outbreaks.  If the father felt left
          out of the abortion decision or only resentfully agreed to the abortion,
          or if the woman felt pressured into the abortion by her mate, deep
          feelings of resentment and violation of trust might cause frequent
          eruption of emotions.  In the heat of such parental disputes, children
          are likely to get caught in the crossfire, objects of release for the pent-up rage of adults.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#16>16</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
       <LI>The abused child is a victim of the results of abortion, because, as
   Dr. Ney states:

<P><OL>
       <LI>Abortion decreases an individual's instinctual restraint against the
          occasional rage felt toward those dependent on his or her care.
          
<LI>Permissive abortion diminishes the social taboo against aggressing
          the defenseless.
          
<LI>Abortion increases the hostility between generations.
          
<LI>Abortion has devalued children, thus diminishing the value of
          caring for children.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#17>17</A></SUP>
</OL>
<P>

         That abortion actually <EM>increases</EM> child abuse is tragically borne out
    by statistics.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Since <EM>Roe v. Wade</EM>, child abuse has increased proportionately with the
         skyrocketing rate of legal abortions.  The same pattern of increased
         child battery following legalization of abortion has also been observed
         in many other countries, including Canada, Britain, and Japan.
         During 1975 alone, the rate of child battery in New York increased 18
         to 20 percent, leading to estimates that during the 1980s there would
         be 1.5 million battered children, resulting in 50,000 deaths and
         300,000 permanent injuries.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#18>18</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
         Other sources reveal a similar, or worse, picture of violence against
    children.  Anne H. Cohn, executive director of the National Committee for
    the Prevention of Child Abuse, speaking at Brown University, March 8,
    1989, told the audience that "about 2.25 million child abuse cases were
    reported last year, half of which required some form of treatment; 1,130
    deaths were attributed to child abuse last year; the number of reported
    cases has risen 50 percent in the last 5 years."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#19>19</A></SUP>

</OL>
       
<P>  Abortion and child abuse go together.  Each represents the loss of
    reverence for a human person, the willingness to use violence against
    him.  Even when abortion and child abuse are not practiced by the same
    persons, they are manifestations of the same underlying attitude of loss
    of respect for human persons, and thus they tend to exist together.  Again,
    abortion is not a solution to the terrible problem of child abuse; it is part
    of that problem.

	Abortion and the "Defective" Child
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

The third of the three arguments for the sake of the child says, "We should
    not bring a defective child into the world.  If we have reasonable grounds
    to believe that the child will be defective, and therefore handicapped,
    either physically deformed or mentally retarded, it is an act of mercy not
    to let such a child come into the world.  He will have a miserable life, a life
    of anguish and suffering.  We should spare him that.  It is better for him
    that he not be born at all."

<P>         Abortion to prevent the birth of a "defective" child is not morally
    justified, for several reasons.
       
<P><OL><LI>The verdict that a child in the womb will be born defective can
    easily be mistaken.  It is hardly ever, if ever, a certain one.  As a rule it is
    a mere probability, and not even a very high one. "There is some chance
    that your child will be born with a defect."

<P>         Since that is so, why not wait until birth?  Why kill a child who might
   be defective?  One may well be killing a child who is in fact perfectly
   healthy.  So, if the reasoning is that a "defective" child should be
   terminated, why not wait until one knows with certainty whether she is
   in fact "defective." Why not wait until birth?
       
<P>  And kill her at birth?  Does that sound horrible?  But why is killing
   this same child before birth any different?  Why is killing her at an earlier
   phase of her existence "all right," "an act of mercy," while killing her at a
   later phase such a horrible thing?  The difference is purely psychological.
   One who favors killing before birth - called abortion - need not see the
   child, hear her cry, or look into her pleading eyes.  The child is not seen,
   so she is psychologically not there as a real person with whom we identify.
   That says a lot about us; it says nothing of any significance about the child
   herself.
       
<P><LI>It is one thing if a severely handicapped person decides for himself
   that his life is not worth living; it is quite another if we impose such a
   decision on him.  The same reasons, in terms of individual autonomy, that
   make it wrong to kill an unwanted child also make it wrong to kill a
   defective child.

<P><LI>Many handicapped people have happy lives.  They find meaning
   and fulfillment in life through creativity and love. They are glad to be alive.
   The argument for aborting a defective child assumes that such a child will
   be unhappy. This is an unwarranted assumption, and when it is removed,
   the pro-abortion argument based on it collapses.

<P>         Eugene F. Diamond, M.D., speaks to this point, and to the
   previous one:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         There is no evidence that the handicapped child would rather not go
         on living.  As a matter of fact, handicapped persons commit suicide far
         less often than normal persons.  An interesting study was done at the
         Ana Stift in Hanover, Germany, a center where a large number of
         children with phocomelia, due to thalidomide, are cared for.  Psychological testing on these children indicated that they do indeed value
         their lives, that they are glad that they were born and they look forward
         to the future with hope and pleasant anticipation.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#20>20</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
         There are numerous case histories of handicapped persons leading
   productive, fulfilled, meaningful lives, glad that they are alive.  Each of
   them is a refutation of the idea that a handicapped person cannot achieve
   a meaningful life; or that such a person is merely a "vegetable."

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         In a 1973 issue of <EM>Newsweek</EM> magazine, the medical section carried
         an article entitled "Shall This Child Die?" It reported on the work of
        Drs.  Raymond S. Duff and A. G. M. Campbell at the Yale-New Haven
        Hospital.  These men permit babies born with birth defects to die by
        deliberately withholding vital medical treatments.  The doctors are
        convincing the parents that these children would be a financial
        burden and that they had "little or no hope of achieving meaningful
        'humanhood." The doctors understood that they were breaking the
        law by doing away with what they called "vegetables," but they
        believed the law should be changed to allow for such deaths.

<P>              Sondra Diamond, who is in private practice as a counseling psychologist and is currently completing her doctoral work, responded to
        the article in a letter to the editor of <EM>Newsweek</EM>...
       
<P>       "I'll wager . . . that you have never received a letter from a
        vegetable before this one, but much as I resent the term, I must
        confess that I fit the description of a 'vegetable' as defined in the article,
        Shall This Child Die?'
       
<P>       Due to severe brain damage incurred at birth, I am unable to
        dress myself, toilet myself, or write: my secretary is typing this letter.
        Many thousands of dollars had to be spent on my rehabilitation and
        education in order for me to reach my present professional status as
        a counseling psychologist.  My parents were also told, 35 years ago,
        that there was 'little or no hope of achieving meaningful humanhood'
        for their daughter.  Have I reached 'humanhood'?  Compared with Drs.
        Duff and Campbell I believe I have surpassed it!"<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#21>21</A></SUP>

<P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
        The term "vegetable" is one of the greatest affronts to the dignity and
  preciousness of each person: its use cannot be too strongly condemned.
  No human beings are "vegetables," they are all persons.  Some lack the
  physical skills, mental abilities, or other capacities that we associate with
  "normal" persons. This does not make them nonpersons, "vegetables." If
  we use this term, we are failing, they are not.  We fail in our response to
  their being as persons, as full persons, with the same dignity and rights
  as the rest of us.

<P>        Not all handicapped people can reach a level of achievement like that
  of Sondra Diamond.  Meaningful human life does not require this.  My
  father, Balduin Schwarz, told me of the moving experience he had long
  ago in a home for the severely mentally retarded.  Though very limited in
  their activities, they showed by their facial expressions and gestures a
  deep gratitude to those who took care of them.  They were capable of
  receiving and giving love.  They appreciated what was done for them, they
  responded from their hearts, and in this their lives had a deep meaning.
       
<P><LI>But suppose a handicapped person is not happy, even miserably
  unhappy.  Does that mean we should kill him?  Should we kill all unhappy
  <EM>born</EM> persons.  Why try to kill all unhappy <EM>preborn</EM> persons?

<P>       I suggest that the argument for abortion for a "fetus" diagnosed as
  probably "defective" rests on the assumption that the "fetus" represents
  a merely potential person who is not yet there, and who may therefore be
  terminated before he actually arrives.  Hence the phrase "let us not bring
  into the world a defective child," as though the child were not yet here.
  Once the fallacy of this assumption is recognized, and it is seen that the
  child is already here, then anyone who reverences human life, all human
  persons, whether normal or handicapped, will understand the absurdity
  of abortion in the name of "not bringing a 'defective' child into the world."
  (The same point applies to the "unwanted child.")
       
<P><LI>I noted above the inappropriateness of the term <EM>unwanted</EM> as
  applied to children: there are no unwanted children, only unwanting
  adults.  Some such parallel applies to the term <EM>defective</EM>, as in "defective
  child." It is true that there are real differences among children, between
  those who have the capacity to walk and those who do not, between those
  who can see and those who are blind, and so on.  These are important
  differences, and the negative in each case does imply a defect.  But it is not
  a defect of the <EM>person</EM>; it is a defect in ability and bodily state.  The term
  "defective child" is odious because it implies that it is the child himself
  who is defective, rather than something about his body.

<P>       "But many defective babies die naturally before birth, in the very
  early stages, or later by miscarriage.  Nature 'takes care of them' by
  providing a merciful death.  Where nature fails, should we not do the
  same: provide a merciful death?  Should we not, therefore, abort
  defective babies?" No. There is a world of difference between natural
  death and murder! If a very sick person dies of his illness, that is a natural
  death; it is not a moral evil, it is not murder, since no one intentionally killed him.  If he is deliberately killed, "mercy killing," that is
  murder.  What is perfectly obvious for born persons applies equally to
  preborn persons.
</OL>

<P>
  <EM>Abortion for the Sake of the <A NAME=Family>Family</A></EM>


<P>  Abortion is sometimes advocated for the sake of family welfare. "We
  cannot take care of another child.  It would not be fair to the other
  children." These, and other similar reasons, may be valid for not bringing
  another child into existence.  But once a child is there?  We have only to
  remember that the child in the womb is already there, as much as any
  born child.  She is just as real as a born child and should be treated in the
  same way.

<P>
           The reply to this abortion argument is basically twofold.  One:
    Abortion would not be right even if it did benefit the family.  As I have been
    stressing, we cannot benefit people by murdering someone.  We cannot
    kill B to benefit A, not even to save As life, still less for other benefits.
       
<P>    Two: Abortion does not benefit a family.  On the contrary, it has in
    general a disastrous effect on the family and its members in four specific
    ways.
       
<P>    First, in a society where abortion is accepted, children who survive
    to be born naturally wonder why they exist when many of their brothers
    and sisters were destroyed.  Such children, Dr. Ney states, may suffer from
    guilt, from distrust regarding their future, and from carrying a heavy
    burden of expectation they may not be able to fill.  "Since their fate once
    hung on their desirability, they tend to feel secure only when they are
    pleasing to their parents."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#22>22</A></SUP> This is a heavy burden to carry, not all
    children succeed. In some cases it may lead to depression and suicide.
    Ney also explains that having abortions causes guilt leading to "antepartum depression that interferes with a mother's ability to bond."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#23>23</A></SUP> Failure
    to achieve bonding with the child tends to lead to child abuse, problems
    with subsequent pregnancies, and aversion to touching a child born later.
    Children who are abortion survivors, since they feel they exist only
    because their mothers chose them, tend to feel deeply insecure.  "Since
    their security rests in their wantedness.... [they] keep checking. . . , 'Do
    you really want me?"<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#24>24</A></SUP>
       
<P>    Second, perhaps the deepest and most devastating effect of abortion
    on family life. and the other children especially, is that abortion cheapens
    life:
       
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
    Abortion diminishes the value of all people, particularly children.
           When the destruction of the unborn child is socially sanctioned and
           even applauded, the child can't have much value.  More than anyone,
           children realize they are becoming worth less.  Thus, the rate of suicide
           has increased correspondingly.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#25>25</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
           "Every child a wanted child" sounds noble.  When it is taken to imply
    the destruction of children who are unwanted, it becomes something
    frightening.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
           If society adheres to the ethic that the unborn child only has value
           when he is wanted, that ethic can easily be applied to small
           children.... If the unborn has no value and it is all right to kill him,
           then it is defensible to kill children who have lost value because they
           are now unwanted.

<P>                People do not harm what they highly value.  As children decline
           in value, it becomes easier to neglect and dispose of them. <SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#26>26</A></SUP>

</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

        A third dimension of abortion on the family is its destructive effect
     on the structure of the family.  Under current American law, a woman can
     get an abortion without her husband's consent, even without his knowledge.  The child conceived by the man and woman together is torn from
     the man and put at the mercy of the woman who has the power to have
     him destroyed.  The union of father-mother-child is destroyed; the family
     structure is effectively destroyed.  Or, if it survives, it does so in spite of
     the power, enshrined in law, of a woman to destroy her unborn child, a
     child that should be seen as belonging in a family rather than to an
     individual woman.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#27>27</A></SUP>
       
<P>  The same applies to the right, under current American law, of a
     minor to have an abortion without her parents' consent or knowledge.  A
     child who cannot have even minor surgery without parental consent may
     have an abortion! Recall the hazards for women from abortion, physical
     and psychological.  These alone should mandate the necessity for parental
     consent.  The preborn child may be torn from the young (minor) woman;
     and she may be torn from her parents in her decision to abort.  In no other
     way could the family structure be more effectively destroyed.
       
<P>  Noonan puts it well when he observes that making abortion legal and
     readily available means that a "childbearing woman ... became a solo
     entity unrelated to husband or boyfriend, father or mother, deciding for
     herself what to do with her child.  She was conceived atomistically, cut off
     from the family structure."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#28>28</A></SUP>
       
<P>  Finally, abortion can be devastating to the man, and to the relation
     between him and the woman.  The man is often the forgotten figure in the
     abortion drama.  "What many people don't realize is that men, too, suffer
     from the abortion process - especially fathers of aborted children.  Whether
     they encouraged the abortion or opposed it, they endure feelings of guilt,
     depression, grief, and often describe the abortion experience as bewildering and painful beyond their coping abilities."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#29>29</A></SUP>
       
<P>   Here is an excerpt from a pamphlet titled: "How Abortion Affects Men:
     They Cry Alone." Referring first to the woman, it says: "The evidence grows
     daily that she is, indeed, a casualty - that she is a real victim, along with
     her unborn baby, of this most unnatural procedure.... The purpose of
     the pamphlet is to point out that much the same can be said of the aborted
     child's father."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#30>30</A></SUP>
       
<P>   Dr. Vincent Rue expounds:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
           Sociologist Arthur Shostak observed in an article for <EM>The Family
           Coordinator</EM> that three out of four male respondents studied said they
           had a difficult time with the abortion experience and that a sizable
           minority reported persistent day and night dreams about the child
           that never was, and considerable guilt, remorse and sadness.
<P>

              For men and women alike, the feeling of emptiness may last a
        lifetime, for parents are parents forever, even of a dead child.  Emotional resolution is nearly impossible because there is no visible
        conclusion - just a memory.  Because the unborn child was denied
        humanity, he or she is denied a grave or marker.  The grieving process
        is left unfinished....
       
<P>       Because of the basic inequality between the partners in the
        abortion decision, the capacity to develop trust.... intimacy, honesty
        and companionship is severely restricted.  This same inequality has
        the potential to breed displaced male aggression via child abuse,
        spousal abuse or self-abuse.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#31>31</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
       A woman's "right to choose" abortion, and the law that protects this,
  means that the father is denied any rights to protect the child.  In many
  cases the father very much wants the child.  To have his own child
  destroyed, at the request of the woman with whom he begot this child, is
  devastating.
       
<P>Not all men want the child.  Some in fact take just the opposite
  position. This too is harmful, for it is harmful to human relations.
  Speaking of men who support abortion, Wailing says, "Now they can
  pursue their pleasures without a thought about the consequences.  When
  told of a pregnancy, they say to the woman, That's your problem.' Other
  men do even worse - they apply great pressure on the woman, threatening to break off the relationship if she doesn't have the abortion.  She must
  choose between the baby or the babys father."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#32>32</A></SUP>
       
<P>Not surprisingly, abortion takes its toll on human relationships:
  "Researcher Emily Milling found that of more than 400 couples who went
  through the abortion experience, most of the relationships (70 percent)
  had failed within one month after the abortion."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#33>33</A></SUP>


<P><EM>
  Abortion for the Sake of <A NAME=Society>Society</A></EM>


<P>  It is argued: "What will we do with all those unwanted babies?  Abortion
  is needed to control population growth in the face of the threat of
  overpopulation," And, "it is unrealistic to say that all abortions are
  immoral.  If we lived in a perfect world, we would not need abortion; but
  we do not.  Killing is never good, but it is sometimes necessary, as in war
  time."
       
<P>First, abortion is bad for society because it is bad for people! Abortion
  is bad for the child.  The child is already in the world.  She should not be
  excluded from membership in our society merely because she is still in
  a secluded place, necessary for her so that she is nourished and protected
   during those first formative weeks of her life.  Abortion is bad because it
   represents frightening hazards for women, physically and psychologically.  It is bad because of its effects on other children.  It is bad because
   of its effects on the family structure.  It is bad because of its effects on men.
   Abortion is bad because of its effects on human relations.
       
<P>  Many other dimensions could be added: its effect on the medical
   profession when doctors, committed to healing and saving, become hired
   killers; its effect on nurses having to reassemble the broken pieces of a
   baby torn apart by the abortion knife; and its effect on the society that
   lives in the midst of a holocaust.  Abortion is a deadly plague with many
   victims.
       
<P>  Second, "What will we do with all those unwanted babies?" Often it
   is the pregnancy that is unwanted.  The child once born, and perhaps even
   before birth, is very much wanted.  A child unwanted now may be very
   much wanted later.  And if a child is at first wanted, then later unwanted,
   does the objection imply that she should later be killed, when she is born?
   Adoption, not abortion. While millions of babies are killed, so many
   couples who want to adopt cannot.
       
<P>  If there are still many babies "left over," we can make room for them.
   We can adjust our lifestyles to take care of them.  If a boat full of poor,
   hungry refugees were to come to our shores, begging to be allowed in,
   would we turn them away to their deaths?  Or would we open our hearts
   to them?  Open our gates to let them in?
       
<P>  Abortion is, if anything, still worse than a closed door to refugees;
   that is more like withholding support, as discussed in chapter 8. Abortion
   should be compared to killing the refugees after they land on our shores.
   ("The child is already in the world.")
       
<P>  In the worst case scenario, we return to the original question, "What
   will we do with all those unwanted babies?" Mass extermination, as the
   Nazis did with "all those unwanted people" in their society?  If it would be
   an atrocity to kill "all those unwanted babies" <EM>after</EM> birth, would it be any
   less of an atrocity to kill them <EM>before</EM> birth?
       
<P>  It is sometimes said that abortion is cheaper than welfare; that
   eliminating or sharply curtailing abortion means adding welfare costs
   later on.  This is not evident when we consider the thousands of couples
   eager to adopt and take care of babies.  But grant the premise for the sake
   of argument.  "Abortion is cheaper than welfare." Of course.  It is always
   cheaper to kill a child than to feed him and clothe him! The same applies
   to the aged, infirm, and to handicapped persons.  What follows? That we
   should kill people to get them out of the way?
       
<P>  Third, "Abortion is needed to control population growth in the face
   of the threat of overpopulation." The question of overpopulation is broad
   and complex, far beyond the scope of this book.  Let me suggest three
   significant points in reply to this objection.
       
<P><OL><LI>There is evidence to suggest that population growth, far from being
   a threat, is actually healthy. One author who argues for this is P. T. Bauer.
   His thesis is that as population increases the standard of living increases.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Since the 1950s rapid population increase in densely-populated Hong
         Kong and Singapore has been accompanied by large increases in real
         income and wages.  The population of the Western world has more
         than quadrupled since the middle of the eighteenth century.  Real
         income per head is estimated to have increased by a factor of five or
         more.  Most of the increase in incomes took place when population
         increased as fast as, or faster than, in the contemporary less developed world.. . .

<P>              In both the less developed world and in the West some of the most
         prosperous countries and regions are extremely densely populated.
         Hong Kong and Singapore are probably the most densely populated
         countries in the world, with originally very poor land.... In the
         advanced world Japan, West Germany, Belgium and Holland are
         examples of densely populated countries.  Conversely, many millions
         of extremely backward people live in sparsely populated regions
         amidst cultivable land.  Examples include the backward peoples in
         Sumatra, Borneo, Central Africa and the interior of South America.
         They have ready access to vast areas of land - for them land is a free
         good.  In South Asia, generally regarded as a region suffering from
         over-population, there is much uncultivated land, land which could
         be cultivated at the level of technology prevailing in the region....<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#34>34</A></SUP>

<LI>Evidence contradicts the idea that unchecked human reproduction will fill the earth because the sheer number of people will outdistance
   food resources, as Malthus warned.  James A. Weber argues against
   Malthus (and contemporary Malthusians such as Paul Ehrlich):

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         This Malthusian drama of despair has captured the imagination of
         generation after generation of population experts, including our
         present crop of doomsayers. However, there is one thing wrong with
         the scenario.  It is exactly the opposite of what has happened in the
         past or what can be expected to happen in the future.

<P>              Far from outdistancing material progress in the past, population
         growth has lagged far behind, as is evidenced by continuing rapid
         increase in per capita income that has occurred in the United States
         and other advanced countries since Malthus formulated his population principle.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#35>35</A></SUP>
       
<P>       However, <EM>based on broad trends of past and present world population growth</EM>, it is possible to suggest that world population will return
          to an extremely slow growth rate about the time it reaches the
          neighborhood of 10 billion people, which should be approximately the
middle of the next century.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#36>36</A></SUP>

<P>
          Jacqueline R. Kasun argues that 10 billion people is not too many for
    the world to sustain:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          Colin Clark, former director of the Agricultural Economic Institute at
          Oxford University and noted author of many books on population-resource questions, classified world land types by their food-raising
          capabilities and found that if all farmers were to use the best methods
          now in use, enough food could be raised to provide an American-type
          diet for 35,100,000,000 people, almost 10 times as many as now exist!
          Since the American diet is a very rich one, Clark found that it would
          be possible to feed three times as many again - or 30 times as many
          people as now exist - at a Japanese standard of food intake.  Nor would
          these high levels of food output require cropping of every inch of
          available land space.  Clark's model assumed that nearly half of the
          earth's land area would remain conservation areas.  The noted city
          planner, Constantin Doxiasis, arrived independently at a similar
          estimate of the world's ability to feed people and to provide conservation areas.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#37>37</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          Clearly there is plenty of room on this earth for 10 billion people. "We
    could put the entire world population [around 4 billion] in the state of
    Texas and each man, woman and child could be allotted 2,000 square feet
    [the average home ranges between 1,400 and 1,800 square feet] and the
    whole rest of the world would be empty."<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#38>38</A></SUP>
       
<P><LI>There is evidence to suggest that the problem, far from being a
    population explosion, is rather the opposite: a declining population, a
    population rate below replacement, leading to extinction:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          Ansley J. Coale, director of the office of Population Research at
          Princeton University, states: "Of the 31 countries that are usually
          listed as highly developed, 21 now have birthrates below replacement." Coale points out that, in the U.S., "by the time the Zero
          Population Growth movement came along, fertility was in the midst of
          its steepest decline in history - 50% in 16 years.  We are below
          replacement now and are continuing to grow only because of the age
          distribution of the population.  If the downtrend continues, we will
          begin to have a shrinking population not long after the end of the
          century." . . .

<P>                Thus, there is no population explosion in the U.S. or in the other
          developed countries.  Population scholars estimate that rates of growth
          are higher in the less-developed world, but also note evidence of
        declining growth rates in a majority of the countries for which data are
        available.<SUP><A HREF=notes11.htm#39>39</A></SUP>

</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
       <LI>Suppose the worst, that there is a real danger from a population
  explosion.  Are we simply going to kill off all the "extra people," a Nazi-type
  "final solution"?  It is shocking even to mention this.  The alternative is that
  all persons be respected, that no one be killed to get him out of the way.
  All persons means everyone, born or preborn.

<P>       Fourth, "Isn't an absolute ban on abortion unrealistic?  We don't live
  in a perfect world.  Killing in war is bad, but war is sometimes necessary.
  Isn't it the same with abortion?"
       
<P>We do not live in a perfect world.  We live in the pervasive presence
  of moral evil.  Abortion as the unjust killing of small, helpless, innocent
  children, especially on a mass scale that makes it a holocaust, is a
  frightening example of this.  Far from being a solution, abortion killings
  make the world more imperfect.  And much worse than imperfect.
       
<P> The destructive effects of abortion - on women, on men, on other
  children, on the structure of the family, on society - make abortion hardly
  a realistic solution, but exactly the opposite.  A realistic solution is
  something positive, not destructive like abortion.
       
<P>The argument for abortion that compares it to war is not valid.  If
  "going to war" is a way of trying to settle disputes, the comparison is
  indeed apt: Both are terrible moral evils.  For both are assaults on
  innocent people, both cause horrible sufferings, both have terrible side
  effects; both are fundamentally destructive.  If it is the question of defense
  against unjust attack, war becomes a complex subject, far beyond the
  scope of this book.  Some defensive wars are indeed unjust, and some
  tactics in war are unjust.  Intentionally killing an innocent person is
  always wrong, whether by a rifle, a bomb, a saline solution, or a knife.
       
<P>Abortion is indeed a war, a war on the preborn, in which they cannot
  defend themselves, in which they are killed in extremely cruel ways.
  Saying that war is not a solution applies most aptly to the war on the
  preborn.

	Should the Preborn Child be Given Legal Protection?
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

   Considering everything we have seen so far, the preborn child should
   definitely be given legal protection.  The child in the womb is a person, one
   of us; he should be given the same legal protection we have.  Killing him
   is murder, and all murder must be outlawed.

<P>        However, to give the child the same legal protection we have is to
   prohibit abortion, to make it illegal, a criminal offense.  This evokes strong
   resentment and opposition, not only on the part of those who approve
   abortion, but even on the part of some who recognize it as a moral evil.
   What is needed, therefore, is a careful analysis of this question, one that
   examines the objections to making abortion illegal and offers replies, and,
   more fundamentally, provides a clear understanding of the question of
   the legal status of abortion.

<P>        This question is a moral question, a question of what, morally,
   should be done.  It is a moral question about the legal order, what the law
   should say.  Murder, theft, and rape are, first and primarily, moral evils.
   But it is also true that they should be illegal.  It is a moral requirement that
   the state should protect people from these moral evils.  Its failure to do so,
   by making these actions legal, would itself be a moral evil; a moral wrong
   in addition to the wrong these actions represent in themselves.

   If the reality of the child in the womb is kept clearly in mind, killing such
   a person is, morally, exactly like killing any other person.  And so, if killing
   a born person is murder, a matter for state law, then killing a preborn
   person is murder and a matter for state law as well.
      
<P>Recall the horrible methods of abortion.  The child is dismembered or
soaked in a saline solution that burns his skin for one to two hours.
Abortion is a <EM>public</EM> moral evil, one that the state has the duty to forbid.
If the state has the duty to protect born persons from such terrible evils,
it has exactly the same duty to protect preborn persons from them.

<P>      Think also of how killing a person to get rid of him is a violation of
human dignity.  It is the duty of the state to uphold this dignity, to protect
it from assault.  This is perhaps the highest obligation of the state.  Balduin
Schwarz argues, <EM>"The dignity of the human person is the highest legal
good."</EM><SUP><A HREF=notes12.htm#1>1</A></SUP> And it is for this reason that the state 
exists, to protect this good.<SUP><A HREF=notes12.htm#2>2</A></SUP>
It is an inalienable, absolute good, that cannot be compromised for
expediency.<SUP><A HREF=notes12.htm#3>3</A></SUP> In fact, every law and legal code must be 
measured by this
standard, whether or not it upholds and protects the dignity of the person,
or accedes to the violation of this dignity, such as a law that allows slavery
or the murder of born or preborn persons.<SUP><A HREF=notes12.htm#4>4</A></SUP>

<P>      Thus abortion must be made illegal.  The prohibition of abortion is
one of the duties and concerns of the state.  Preborn human beings must
be given the <EM>same protection of law</EM> that the rest of us are entitled to.  If
we fail to see abortion as murder, it is because its victim is unseen, and
smaller, and the circumstances of the killing are somewhat different.
These are morally irrelevant.  The crucial thing is that an innocent person
is killed to get him out of the way, as clear a case of murder as can be
found.  The respectability in which the act, and the doctor who performs
it, is clothed must not hide its true reality: abortion is the murder of an
innocent child.  It must be labeled as such, and therefore outlawed.
 
<P>     Abortion is a <EM>civil rights</EM> issue, just like racial justice for blacks, or
equal treatment of the handicapped, and of all minorities.  In allowing
abortion, the state is not being liberal, but on the contrary, repressive.  It
is denying the basic human right of a large segment of the population.  The
fundamental duty of the state is to protect the rights of its people.  Legalized abortion, saying yes to 
abortion, means abandoning this most basic
civil right, the right to live, of a whole class of human beings to the brutal
power of those who would kill them.  Nothing is a more flagrant contradiction to the basic reason for the 
existence of the state.

<P>      Making abortion illegal is necessary to guarantee preborn persons
<EM>equal rights</EM>, the same rights you and I have.  Legal abortion, saying it is
wrong to kill born persons but acceptable to kill preborn persons, is an
outrageous violation of the latter's right to equal protection under the law.

<P>      Allowing abortion is a form of <EM>discrimination</EM>. In allowing abortion,
the state is saying to a class of persons: "You're too small, too dependent,
not sufficiently developed.  We can't see you; you're not in an environment
like the rest of us.  So you don't count.  While it is a criminal offense to kill
     other persons, it is all right to kill you." Blacks were treated as nonpersons
     because they had the "wrong" skin color; the preborn are treated as
     nonpersons because they have the "wrong" size, location, level of development, etc.  We move from 
one form of discrimination to another.  In each
     case a human being is denied his civil rights because he is perceived as
     different.  In each case the differences are morally irrelevant.

<P>          Legalized abortion is a form of <EM>slavery</EM>.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes12.htm#5>5</A></SUP> The essence of slavery is that
     a person is treated as a thing, in the sense of being "owned," as if he were
     a car or a house.  He is looked upon as something to be used or disposed
     of at will.  In the case of black slavery, slaves were used for work.  In the
     case of abortion, the child is disposed of.  But in each case there is the core
     idea of a right to treat a person as a thing, to determine his ultimate fate
     (use or disposal).  That such a view is translated into practice in which a
     person is actually enslaved is horrible enough.  But that the state allows
     this and puts its blessing on it by making it legal is an additional horror.
     Abortion is today's slavery.  The child belongs to the woman - not in the
     noble sense of being entrusted to her, but in the ignoble sense of being a
     "thing" that may be disposed of.  All with the blessing of the law.

	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

     It is often said that making abortions illegal will not stop them.  Quite true.
     Making rape illegal does not stop it from occurring.  But now imagine a
     government that made rape legal!<SUP><A HREF=notes12.htm#6>6</A></SUP> That would be an 
outrage beyond
     words.  Imagine a government that made the murder of adults legal, or
     that made child abuse and child murder legal.  It is terrible enough if
     people commit these crimes against the explicit laws of the state.  But if
     the state says, "It's all right, you can do these things" - if it gives these
     crimes its blessing by allowing them - that is an unspeakable, and new
     evil.
<P>
          It is said that making abortion illegal means "restrictive abortion
     laws," and that we should instead have "liberalized laws," namely those
      that allow abortions, in whole or in part.  First, all laws that protect the
     innocent from attack (rape, murder, child abuse, etc.) are restrictive, for
     their whole purpose is to restrict the actions of all potential offenders in
     order to protect potential victims.  Restrictive in this context is a good
     thing.  It is only undue restrictions that are bad, especially those that
     preclude doing things one has a right to do.  No one has the right to kill
     an innocent person, born or preborn.

<P>          Second, and especially significant, liberal or liberalized abortion
     laws are the greatest imaginable misnomer.  The true liberal spirit is
    freedom, especially the most basic freedom, the freedom to be.  Laws
    allowing abortion are precisely a denial of this freedom to the preborn
    child.  They are thus a direct antithesis to what is truly liberal.  By calling
    laws liberal that allow the killing of innocent preborn children, one
    manages to veil their absolute anti-liberal character.  Abortion seems
    acceptable, even respectable, because of the veil of language.  Black is
    called white; suppression is called liberalism.

<P>         One can also say that the true liberal spirit is compassion and
    concern for others, especially the weak and the helpless, those who
    cannot fend for themselves.  The opposite of this is oppression.  Legalized
    abortion is enthronement in the law of the worst sort of oppression: killing
    a child because he is helpless, unable to escape or defend himself.
        
<P> As noted, a new evil comes into existence when the government fails
    to protect preborn babies, saying, in effect, "You may kill them if you like."
    A still greater evil comes into existence when a high level of government
    not only fails in its duty to protect preborn persons, but mandates that
    no one may protect them.  This has been the situation in the United States
    since the Supreme Court decision <EM>Roe v. Wade</EM>.  It claimed that a woman
    has a constitutional right to have an abortion, hence that all laws
    forbidding abortion are unconstitutional.  Therefore, the states may not
    protect children in the womb.
        
<P> What this means is that those who want to protect preborn persons
    are attempting something illegal.  What they want is contrary to today's
    law.

	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

    Making illegal the crime of killing an innocent person, while it does not
    eradicate it, does make it far less frequent.  Our government's power to
    protect people, while far from perfect, is still quite significant.
        
<P> There are several important dimensions to this.  One is the deterrent
    power of criminal penalties attached to laws that forbid attacks on
    innocent persons.  If a person will not respect the integrity of another for
    moral reasons, let him at least do so for practical reasons, the avoidance
    of punishment.  The important thing is that the potential victim be
    protected, whether it is protecting a woman from rape or a child from
    being killed.
        
<P> Thus, doctors who are abortion killers must be subject to the same
    penalties as all other killers.  The manufacture and distribution of child-killing drugs such as RU486 
must be made illegal and subject to criminal
    penalties.

<P>          A second dimension concerns the protection of women.  To a large
    extent, women do not really want abortions.  Reardon emphasizes this fact
    again and again:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>

          As we have seen in story after story, women choose abortion because
          they feel there is "no other option." They abort because it is the "easy
          way out." They abort because they feel abandoned by their lovers,
          friends, and families.  Without the support to do the right thing, they
          yield to doing the "easy thing." In today's society, it does not take
          courage to abort: it takes courage to stand up against all the pressures
          and inconveniences which push towards abortion.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes12.htm#7>7</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          A law allowing abortion makes it much easier for the man, family
    members, and others to pressure a woman into an abortion she does not
    want.  What the woman needs is protection against such pressures.  A law
    forbidding abortion, and its penalties, provides that.  Reardon explains:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          Legalization . . . has made abortion <EM>too</EM> easy to obtain.  It has now
          become easier to coax, or even coerce, a woman uncertain about her
          pregnancy to accept abortion as the "easy out." Such women are made
          to believe that aborting is something they <EM>should</EM> do, if only for the
          male, or for their parents, or for their own vague "future" which friends
          and family hold in such high esteem.  Before, these women were
          protected from being pressured into an abortion because they had
          ready reasons for refusal: "But abortion is illegal! What if we're
          caught?  Isn't it dangerous?"<SUP><A HREF=notes12.htm#8>8</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          A third, very important, dimension is the law as a teacher, as a guide
    to people's thinking.  The law helps to create a certain climate of moral
    opinion.  Making abortion legal conveys the message that it is morally
    acceptable.  However incorrect it is to suppose that whatever the law
    allows is morally right, there is an element of truth in this idea; namely,
    the expectation that if something is a violation of the fundamental rights
    of persons, then the state will forbid it.  That expectation is absolutely
    correct; the state should forbid such things.  It should forbid all murder.
    In allowing abortion, the state fails people and their legitimate expectations.

<P>          This is yet another reason why abortion is seen as complex.  Making
    it legal creates a climate of opinion in which many people see it, to one
    degree or another, as acceptable.  Others see it as wrong, some as
    absolutely and clearly wrong, as the evil it really is.  A division of opinion
    ensues and one concludes it is controversial; hence it must be complex.
    In fact, it is not complex but a clear-cut evil, the appearance of complexity
    stemming in part from the fact that it has been made legal.
<P>
 
           Reardon explains the importance of the law:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
           Laws against abortion may seem restrictive to those who want
           abortions, but they are also an encouragement to those who are
           tempted by abortion but know that it is wrong.  For those women who
           struggle against the pressure that force them toward abortion, the
           law is a backstop that reminds them that their sacrifices are worthwhile, that they are doing the 
right thing if not the convenient thing.
           Social acceptance of abortion, on the other hand, tells women that
           they are foolish not to abort an inconvenient pregnancy....
<P>
               Studies into the psychology of morality reveal that the law is
           truly a teacher. One of the most significant conclusions of these
           studies shows that existing laws and customs are <EM>the most</EM> important
           criteria for deciding what is right or wrong for most adults in a given
           culture.... Most people look to law for moral guidance.  Right now the
           law is teaching that abortion is a moral and presumably effective
           solution to unplanned pregnancies.  As a result, millions of unborn
           children are being destroyed, an equal number of women are being
           physically and emotionally violated, and society's compassion for
           both women and their children is being eroded.<SUP><A HREF=notes12.htm#9>9</A></SUP>

<P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

           The statistics support this.  Legalizing abortion means increasing
    abortion:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>

           Before legalization there were only 100,000 to 200,000 illegal abortions per year - a range 
substantiated by both statistical evidence and
           the testimony of aborted women.  But in 1983 there were approximately 1.5 million legal 
abortions.  This means that legalization has
           caused a <EM>ten</EM> to <EM>fifteen</EM> fold increase in the number of abortions

           The law influences women's perceptions of abortion, and                  their
    decisions whether or not to have them:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>

           Given their doubts about the morality of abortion, most aborting
           women are strongly influenced by the legal status of the abortion
           option.  When asked "Did the knowledge that abortion was legal
           influence your opinion about the morality of choosing abortion?" 70
           percent said that the law had played a major role in their moral
           perception of abortion.<SUP><A HREF=notes12.htm#11>11</A></SUP>

<P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

           Asked whether or not they would have sought an illegal abortion if
    a legal abortion had not been available, 75 percent said they definitely
    would not have sought an illegal abortion.<SUP><A HREF=notes12.htm#12>12</A></SUP>

   "The question of abortion is something very intimate, very private to a
   woman.  Only she should decide whether to continue her pregnancy to
   term, or to end it by abortion.  No one else, and certainly not the
   government, should tell a woman what to do.  She alone should decide.
   Hence abortion should be legal."

<P>        There is certainly something very intimate in the relation between a
   woman and the child she is carrying.  The child is hers, entrusted to her,
   residing in her, nourished by her, protected by her.  And it is a terrible evil
   if someone comes from the outside to interfere with this relationship
   destructively.  It is abortion, not the prohibition of it, that violates the
   intimate realm of a woman who is pregnant.  It is abortion that intrudes
   into this beautiful sanctuary, where a small, innocent, defenseless child
   is nestled and protected.  Abortion sunders the beautiful and natural
   relation that exists between woman and child by violently tearing the
   child out, brutally killing him in the process.
       
<P> That the woman herself requests the abortion in no way nullifies this
   point.  It is objectively a violent sundering of this natural, intimate
   relationship.  By her abortion she becomes a part of this terrible evil, and
   often suffers from it as the second victim.
       
<P> Yes, there is something private and intimate that we should protect:
   the child.  Abortion is a violation of the child's privacy, an intrusion into
   what is intimate for him, his own person.  The methods of abortion and the
   pain they cause are a violation of intimacy and privacy.
       
<P> Thus the appeal to intimacy and privacy, insofar as it is valid and
   reasonable, means forbidding abortions.  The child's right to live, not to be
    killed, especially by the painful methods of abortion, that right surely
    outweighs anyone's claim to a right to privacy.  And the state must protect
    that right, just as it protects other civil rights.
       
<P>    Many of these objections rest on the idea that abortion is private to
    the woman, where no one else should interfere.  It is not.  It involves
    another human person, the child, who is killed by this act.  It involves
    other people as well.  The family structure, human relations, and other
    children may be adversely affected by abortion.  Noonan outlines the
    many ways in which abortion affects society at large:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
           Each act of abortion is, by declaration of the Supreme Court of the
           United States, a private decision.  Yet each act of abortion bears on the
           structure of marriage and the family, the role and duties of parents,
           the limitations of the paternal part in procreation, and the virtues that
           characterize a mother.  Each act of abortion bears on the orientation
           and responsibilities of the obstetrician, the nurse, the hospital administrator, and the hospital trustee.  The acceptance of abortion affects
           the professor and student of medicine and the professor and student
           of law.  In the United States, abortion on a large scale requires the
           participation of the federal and state governments.<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#1>1</A></SUP>

    "A woman has a right over her body, to decide what happens in it, and to
    it. She should have the right to make her own decision regarding her
    pregnancy.  Someone else cannot tell her what she may or may not do with
    her own body."

<P>           This objection has been discussed at length in chapter 
<A HREF=8-0.htm>8</A>. In short,
    a woman's right over her body does not give her a right to an abortion.  The
    child is not a part of her body, but a distinct individual, entrusted to her,
    to be sustained and protected by her.  The woman has a right over her
    body, including the right not to be destroyed.  The child has the same right
    not to be destroyed.  Granting a woman a right to an abortion denies the
    child his most fundamental right.

    "We should not legislate morality.  Morality is a matter of private choice,
    not government legislation."

<P>           We legislate morality all the time, in many ways: laws against the
    murder of born persons, against rape, against other forms of assault,
    against theft, against libel and slander, and many more.  These moral
    evils, as violations of the rights of persons, must be reflected in the law
    and made illegal.

<P>         It is true that certain parts of the moral domain should not be
    reflected in the law.  For example, to be ungrateful is a moral wrong that
    should not be reflected in the law; indeed, it cannot be.  There are other
    matters that are genuinely complex with regard to the question whether
    or not - and if so, to what extent - they should be reflected in the law.  But
    surely the fundamental right to life, not to be killed, belongs within the
    domain of law.  All civil rights should be protected by law.

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Some years ago many people opposed civil rights legislation, saying,
         "You cannot legislate morality." Dr. Martin Luther King responded, "It
         is true, the law cannot make a white man love me, but it can
         discourage him from lynching  me."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#2>2</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
         The distinction drawn here, between the command to love and the
    prohibition against lynching is a good example of the difference between
    the non-legal domain of morality (love) and the legal domain (killing).

	Imposing Morality

	<P>

    "We should not impose our morality on others.  One group should not
    impose its beliefs on the rest of society.  I'm personally opposed to abortion
    but I will not impose that belief on others."
       
<P>  Suppose someone said, "I'm personally opposed to rape, but I will not
    impose that belief on potential rapists." How absurd! This argument is as
    absurd in the case of abortion as it is in that of rape. The law must protect
    all innocent persons from assault: women from rape, babies from
    slaughter.  The morality of not raping, and of not murdering, a fellow
    human being is not "my morality" or "our morality" but morality itself.
       
<P>  Perhaps some people who say they're personally opposed do so
    because they feel abortion is wrong but do not fully understand why; they
    are unable to articulate good moral reasons why it is wrong.  Thus they
    think that others may feel differently about it, and they want to respect
    these differences of opinion or feeling.  "That's the way I feel, but maybe
    you don't."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#3>3</A></SUP> This attitude is psychologically understandable but morally
    disastrous, for the result is that a cruel death is imposed on the child.  We
    must look at the evidence that abortion is wrong, that it is murder; we will
    then see that it is not merely a feeling, but the truth of the matter.
       
<P>  It is true that we should not impose on people.  We should have
    compassion and concern for others, especially the weak, the oppressed,
   the poor, the downtrodden.  We should protect the helpless, not step on
   them.  Legalized abortion is the enshrinement in law of oppression,
   stepping on the weak and defenseless.  Legalizing abortion is saying,
   "Abortionists may crush the little ones if they like." Precisely because we
   should not impose on others, we must not allow such an imposition, the
   crushing to death of innocent, helpless babies in the womb.
       
<P> The term <EM>impose</EM> suggests that outlawing abortion is something bad
   because it imposes a burden or restriction on people.  But all laws impose.
   Traffic laws impose on us certain obligations and restrictions.  Laws
   making abortion illegal are nothing special in this regard.  They are simply
   another instance of the general feature of all laws, to impose certain
   obligations and restrictions for the common good, and to respect other
   individuals as persons and not to hurt or kill them.  Laws outlawing
   abortion merely apply this general feature to one class of persons, preborn
   babies.

<P>

<EM>   Abortion a <A NAME=Controversial>Controversial</A> Matter</EM>


<P>   "Abortion is a controversial matter.  Opinions are divided.  The law should
   reflect this and be neutral, and let each person decide for himself."
       
<P>The government cannot be neutral on this question.  It either
   recognizes the child in the womb as a person, entitled to the same
   protection of law, or it doesn't.  The first is a decision, the one being urged
   here.  The second is equally a decision; it is the decision to surrender the
   child (or "the being in the womb") to the power of a woman and her doctor
   to destroy him.  As William James points out: "<EM>To say, . . . 'Do not decide
   but leave the question open' is itself a ... decision - just like deciding yes
   or no - and is attended with the same risk</EM>. . . ."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#4>4</A></SUP> For example, for the
   government to leave open the question of whether toxic wastes may be
   dumped into rivers, and to let each person decide for himself by legalizing
   such actions is clearly a decision, not neutrality.  So too, legalizing
   abortion is a decision, the decision to allow abortions to take place legally.
   It is clearly not neutrality, but a definite stand: "Such actions are to be
   legally sanctioned."
      
<P>The point being made here is independent of the question of which
   side is correct on the abortion issue; i.e., whether it is morally right or not,
   whether it should be allowed by law or not.  The point is rather that
   allowing abortion is as much a public policy as not allowing it.  The fact
   that abortion is controversial, that opinion is divided on the question, no
   more speaks for allowing it than for not allowing it.

<P>
           Legalizing abortion means settling the issue in favor of those who
      claim that abortion is justified.  Legalized abortion does not correspond to
      neutrality on this issue, it is a verdict against the pro-child position.

<P>           Saying that each person should decide for herself sounds reasonable
      and tolerant.  In fact it represents a death verdict against millions of
      children.  It means surrendering them to the power of those who would
      have them destroyed.

	A Religious Issue
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

      "Abortion is a religious issue.  No group should impose its religious values
      and prohibitions on the rest of society.  We live in a pluralistic society.
      Different groups of people have different moral beliefs.  An individual
      religious group may oppose abortion as morally wrong, but it has no right
      to impose that belief on society as a whole."
       
<P>   The crucial thing is to understand that abortion is wrong because it
      is the killing of an innocent person, the violation of his most fundamental
      right, the right to be. This is not only a religious matter, but a basic ethical
      concern, accessible to all people.  I have urged that we identify with the
      child and do to her what we would want done to us.  These are universal
      ethical appeals, not sectarian religious ideas.
       
<P>  Abortion is a civil rights issue, one that parallels slavery and
      discrimination.  To argue that preborn human beings be given the same
      rights and respect as the rest of us is no more a religious matter than to
      argue that blacks be given the same rights and respect as the rest of us.
       
<P>  There are two senses of the term "religious issue." One refers to what
      the objection is based upon, that is, questions and topics that are properly
      left to individual persons and groups, such as the nature and existence
      of God.  The other refers to religious issues that are also matters of public
      concern, for example marriage, divorce, capital punishment, human
      equality, and discrimination.  To say that something is a religious issue in
      this second sense does not preclude government involvement in it.  On the
      contrary, the government cannot be neutral on these things: for example,
      it either allows no-fault divorce or it does not.  Abortion is a religious issue
      in this second sense.
       
<P> Questions and topics that are religious issues in the second sense
      are generally also philosophical issues; that is, questions that are to be
      answered by the use of reason, rather than appeal to religious faith.  Thus,
      in showing that the being in the womb is a real child and that abortion
      means killing this child, I have made no appeal whatever to any religious
   faith or theological principles.  It has been a strictly philosophical argument, appealing to reason.  In showing that a human person begins her
   existence at conception, I used scientific data and philosophical arguments, especially the one showing that conception-fertilization is the
   radical break.  The two major philosophical arguments attempting to
   justify abortion - Thomson's "no duty to sustain" argument and the
   Tooley-Warren argument that the being in the womb is only biologically
   human but not a person - were refuted by strictly philosophical arguments.  Finally, given that the being in the womb is a small person, it
   follows logically that he should be given the same legal standing as the
   rest of us, that abortion must be made illegal just as any other killing of
   innocent persons.

<P>        It is interesting to note that the preborn child was recognized as a
   person in Roman Law, with the same rights as born persons. Thus, for
   example, Julian, the classical Roman jurist, expresses this recognition in
   Roman Law when he teaches that the child in his mother's womb is to be
   treated as a member of human society in terms of legal rights.  And the
   jurist, Paulus, teaches that whoever is in his mother's womb is to be
   protected as if he were already born; he is to be granted the same civil
   rights and the same benefits accruing from them as anyone else.<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#5>5</A></SUP> Roman
   Law was surely not a religious matter.  What the Roman Law clearly
   recognized, we too should recognize.
       
<P> Furthermore. there are widely recognized secular codes of ethics that
   explicitly condemn abortion and/or acknowledge the sanctity of human
   life in the womb. Thus the <EM>Hippocratic Oath</EM> includes the promise: "I will
   not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#6>6</A></SUP> And <EM>The World Medical
   Association Declaration of Geneva</EM> states, as part of the Physician's Oath,
   "I will maintain the utmost respect for human life from the time of
   conception.  Even under threat, I will not use my medical knowledge
   contrary to the laws of humanity."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#7>7</A></SUP>

<P>

   <EM>No <A NAME=Consensus>Consensus</A> to Make Abortion Illegal</EM>


<P>   There is no consensus for making abortion illegal.  Hence doing so would
   mean unfairly imposing the beliefs of some people on the rest of society."
       
<P> First, just as there is no consensus for making abortion illegal, there
   is also no consensus on making it legal.  Abortion is a controversial matter,
   opinion is divided. The objection argues equally against the pro-abortion,
   or pro-choice, side: "Abortion should not be legal because there is no
   consensus for making it legal."

<P>        Second, we must examine the nature of abortion itself - whether or
   not the being in the womb who is killed is a real person - not what
   people think about abortion.  If abortion is not the killing of a child, if it
   is something private, then it should be legal, consensus or not.  If
   abortion is a woman's right, then she should have that right under the
   law, consensus or not.  Those who campaign for women's rights, including "the right to abortion," believe that this is something right in itself,
   called for in justice, not something that should be enacted only if there
   is a consensus for it.  This shows that consensus is not relevant in this
   kind of issue, where questions of fundamental human rights are at
   stake.
       
<P> Third, when we examine the nature of abortion itself, carefully and
   objectively, we see that the being who is killed by it is a real person, one
   of us.  With this we come to the core fallacy in the consensus objection, and
   the fundamental reply to it as an argument for legalizing abortion.  What
   this argument really says is that a person is not to be given recognition
   under the law as a person, his right to live protected by the state, simply
   because he is a person, and entitled to this protection; but only because
   other persons have agreed to recognize him as a person.  If that view is
   taken no one is safe.  If your right to live, your right to equal protection
   under the law, depends on there being a consensus that the group you
   belong to should be protected, then your rights are fragile indeed.
       
<P> In short, fundamental rights, above all the right of a person to be
   recognized and respected as a person, do not depend on the democratic
   voting procedures that are perfectly appropriate in other matters.  The
   recognition of fundamental rights cannot be made subject to popular
   votes.  Such rights are not granted by the people by majority votes; they
   cannot rightfully be taken away in this manner.  They are above the level
   of democratic processes based on majority opinion.
       
<P> Fourth, suppose there is a lack of consensus for outlawing abortion.
   Rather than wait for a consensus to enact laws to protect the rights of
   preborn persons, these laws should be enacted as a matter of justice, with
   the expectation that the laws will then help create the consensus.  Rather
   than the consensus leading to the laws, the laws can lead to the
   consensus.  This is what occurred in the case of civil rights laws to give
   equal treatment to blacks.  If an oppression is legal (racist oppression of
   blacks, the killing of preborn babies), it tends to be widely practiced.  This
   tends to make it respectable, which in turn tends to create a lack of
   consensus to outlaw the oppression.  We must reverse this process.  Our
   obligation is to respect persons, irrespective of the shifting tides of
   popular consensus.

<P>

<EM>   No Simple Answers to <A NAME=Complex>Complex</A> Questions</EM>


<P>   "We should avoid simplistic answers to complex problems.  Abortion is a
   complex problem, and simply outlawing it is a simplistic solution."
       
<P> First, abortion is only complex psychologically and socially, not
   morally, as was shown in chapter <A HREF=9-0.htm>9</A>. The killing of an innocent child to get
   rid of him is as clear-cut an evil as one can find.
       
<P> Is the outlawing of murder of born persons simplistic?  In a way, yes:
   you simply cannot do that! The same must apply to preborn persons.

<P>        Second, if prohibiting all abortions is simplistic, allowing all abortions -which is the current state of affairs in America<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#8>8</A></SUP> and throughout
   much of the rest of the world - is no less simplistic. What, in the view of
   those who use this objection, would be the ideal or true solution?  A law
   that forbade some abortions and allowed others?  But then why should
   only some innocent preborn children be protected and not others?
   Because there are justifying factors in some cases, such as rape and
   incest?  These factors do not justify murdering the child.  An innocent
   person cannot be killed, or allowed to be killed, for the benefit of others.
       
<P> What, after all, is wrong with a "simple" prohibition of murder?  That
   is all that is being asked for, for preborn and born persons alike.  Changing
   "simple" to "simplistic" is merely inserting a negative emotional overtone,
   to try to frighten people away from supporting what is demanded by
   "simple" justice: protection of innocent, defenseless small babies.

   "Abortion decisions should be left up to individual conscience.  Abortion
   is often an agonizing decision for the woman. We must leave her the
   freedom to make her own decision, in conscience, free from state
   interference."
       
<P> These are noble sounding phrases, and it is understandable that
   people are impressed by them and brought to support a woman's right to
   make her own decision in conscience.  They are psychologically plausible,
   but they are not logically and morally sound.  The law that would <EM>give</EM> a
   woman this right to decide in conscience would thereby <EM>take away</EM> the
   child's legal right to equal protection under the law.  The noble-sounding
   phrases veil the horror of the reality of abortion.
       
<P> There are things that should be left up to individual conscience.
   There are other things that should not.  Equal treatment of blacks in
   society is an obvious example.  Equal treatment for preborn persons is
   another.

<P>        When it comes to questions of fundamental civil rights, laws that
    allow individual conscience to decide mean the surrender of some to the
    power of others to deprive them of these fundamental rights, including the
    power to destroy them.

	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

    "Do you want to return to the butchery of self-induced or back-alley
    abortions?  Keep abortions safe and legal." The right to legal abortion
    is crucial to the health and well-being of American women.  This
    fundamental right is guaranteed by the U.S. Supreme Court decision of
    January 22, 1973, which: Affirms every woman's right to end an
    unwanted pregnancy safely and legally.  Affirms that women need no
    longer be forced by desperation into the horror of underworld abortion."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#9>9</A></SUP>
    "Desperate women will get abortions in any case.  Let us keep them
    legal so that they are safe, so that women are not forced into the
    horrors of back-alley abortionists.  Or to self-induced abortions by coat
    hangers!"

<P>         "Keep abortion safe and legal." First, legal abortion is not safe for the
    child! The idea of a "safe" abortion can arise only if the reality of the child
    is overlooked.
       
<P>  The force of this argument is its own destruction.  It is the horror of
    death and mutilation for women at the hands of back-alley butchers.  But
    this is precisely the horror that is repeated in every abortion! That is why
    every abortion, legal or illegal, must be prevented at all costs.  The true
    response to back-alley abortions is to be outraged at all abortions, to
    condemn <EM>all</EM> abortions - not to propose one kind (legal) in place of another
    (illegal).  The very evil that the argument appeals to is the essence of every
    abortion.  And for this reason every abortion must be condemned, morally
    and by the law.
       
<P>  The "back-alley" argument for legal abortion is a contradiction.  It is
    the argument, "We should allow abortion so that women are not killed."
    But, since abortion is itself killing, the argument reads: "We should allow
    killing so that there is no killing."
       
<P>  We cannot legalize murder.  To appeal to terrible side effects for the
    person ordering the murder is not an argument.  It does not justify the
    murder.  Mary Ann Warren, who advocates the right to abortion, is clear
    on this point: "The fact that restricting access to abortion has tragic side
    effects [i.e.. death due to illegal abortions] does not in itself show that the
    restrictions are unjustified, since murder is wrong regardless of the
    consequences of prohibiting it."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#10>10</A></SUP>
      
<P>The "back-alley" argument is not really an argument, either for the
 moral rightness of abortion or for its legalization, but merely a threat:
 "Give us legal abortions, or else." A law protecting preborn children is a
 just law.  Everyone ought to obey it.  Pointing to the hazards of disobeying
 the law is no more valid in this case than it would be in any other.
      
<P>There is a second major reply to the appeal to "safe abortion": legal
 abortion is not safe for the woman.  Reardon's research reveals a frightening fact: "Legalization has improved the odds that an individual will
 survive an abortion, but the astronomical increase in the number of
 abortions performed means that more women are dying.  <EM>The percentage
 chance of survival is improved, but the absolute number of those who suffer
 has increased!</EM>"<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#11>11</A></SUP>
      
<P>He goes on to add that this increase in suffering applies also to
 abortion complications and that one must also include "the deaths which
 are <EM>indirectly</EM> caused by abortion," namely future wanted babies: "Each
 year approximately 100,000 'wanted' pregnancies will end in the sorrow
 of a spontaneous miscarriage because of latent abortion morbidity."&nbsp;<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#12>12</A></SUP>

<P>      <EM>Keeping abortion illegal is better for women:</EM> "The number of women
 dying and suffering from physical complications alone far exceeds the
 number who would have suffered similarly if abortion had remained
 illegal.  Rather than reducing the pain and suffering of women, legalization
 of abortion has increased it by exposing many more women to its inherent
 risks.  The only difference is that now the pain and suffering can be
 antiseptically ignored because it is 'legal.'"<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#13>13</A></SUP>
      
<P>These numbers are based on reported deaths, and, as I noted before,
 "the reported rate of deaths due to legal abortion is being deliberately kept
 low through selective underreporting."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#14>14</A></SUP>
     
<P> As an example, Reardon mentions a Los Angeles doctor, Lester
 Hibbard, who was "charged with keeping track of maternal deaths." While
 "four abortion-related deaths [were] officially reported as such," Dr.
 Hibbard said that "he <EM>personally</EM> knew of at least four other deaths which
 had followed legal abortions but had not been reported as such on the
 death certificates.  Furthermore, he said he was certain that these
 unreported abortion deaths were only the tip of the iceberg."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#15>15</A></SUP>
   
<P>   Reardon reports, "According to one estimate, less than 10% of deaths
 from legal abortion are reported as such."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#16>16</A></SUP>
    
<P>  Women are suffering and dying from legal abortions partly because
 abortion is inherently unsafe for the woman, an assault on her, and partly
 because, in many cases, the staff at legal abortion centers can be as
 dangerous (or nearly so) to the woman's health as some of the infamous
 "back-alley" abortionists at illegal abortion centers.  Reardon presents a
 frightening array of data:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Abortion clinics routinely hire low-cost, unskilled staff members to
         fulfill the quasi-medical tasks normally performed by physicians or
         nurses.... There are no educational or certification requirements for
         abortion clinic personnel.... The depth of knowledge which abortion
         staff members have, therefore, is generally far below the usual
         standards of the medical and nursing professions.<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#17>17</A></SUP>

<P>               In the typical abortion clinic, these staff members counsel the
         patients about the procedure, examine the patients, estimate gestation, perform any required tests (e.g., pregnancy tests and blood
         samples), record vital signs, prepare the patients for surgery, and
         assist patients through the recovery room.... By delegating responsibility and minimizing patient/doctor interaction, abortionists free
         themselves to work solely on performing the actual abortion in the
         least amount of time possible.&nbsp;<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#18>18</A></SUP>
       
<P>       As a result of cost-efficient measures, most clinics do not have
         transfusion supplies and blood type selections available, even though
         2 to 12 percent of aborted women bleed enough to warrant a transfusion.<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#19>19</A></SUP>

<P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

         "Keep abortion safe and legal." And, "Let us not return to the days
   of back-alley abortionists." How do these phrases square with the reality
   of legal abortion?  Reardon explains: "To increase profits even further,
   abortionists try to work as fast as possible in order to handle as many
   patients per day as possible.  Besides the obvious risks in hurrying a blind
   operation which involves sharp instruments and vacuum pressures
   capable of tearing out organs, the rush for efficiency often results in
   'cutting comers' on normal sanitation standards."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#20>20</A></SUP>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         The <EM>Chicago Sun-Times</EM> series shocked readers with the fact that
         many abortions were being performed by "moonlighting residents,
         [and] general practitioners with little or no training in women's
         medicine." But once again this "revelation" was not unique to the four
         Chicago clinics which were investigated.  Instead the use of such
         "untrained" abortionists is perfectly legal and commonplace.<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#21>21</A></SUP> Abortionists are essentially free of oversight by state and local governments
         or even by state medical boards.  Even if an abortionist causes
         numerous complications or deaths, there is no mechanism to prevent
         him from continuing to perform abortions short of imprisonment for
         criminal neglect.<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#22>22</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
         Both illegal abortions and legal abortions are dangerous for women,
   legal abortions being somewhat safer.  Most women wanting abortions are
   dissuaded from seeking them if they are illegal.  ("75 percent said they
   definitely would not have sought an illegal abortion."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#23>23</A></SUP>) What, then, is the
  actual implication of the appeal to keeping abortion legal for the sake of
  safety?  It would mean increasing the safety margin for a small group of
  women - 25% or so who would resort to it in defiance of the law - while at
  the same time opening the floodgates of massive destruction for millions
  of preborn children and an increase in suffering and death for women as
  a whole.  Legalization improves the odds that an individual woman will
  survive an abortion, but the astronomical increase in the number of
  abortions performed means that more women are dying.

<P>       A word about self-induced abortions by coat hangers.  Here too the
  force of the argument is its own destruction.  The horror of a woman killed
  by a coat hanger is repeated in <EM>every</EM> abortion, with the child the victim
  of a horrible death.  If the woman should not be killed by one instrument
  of death, a coat hanger, then neither should the child be killed by another.
  We cannot legalize murder in order to dissuade people from choosing
  particularly dangerous forms of carrying it out.
      
<P> In addition, coat hangers will be a thing of the past, replaced by new
                   forms of abortion, such as an abortion pill.

<P>       Finally, "a return to illegal abortions" for those who choose to defy the
  law "does not mean that there would be a return to the death and complication rates of illegal abortion prior to 1973," when abortion was
  legalized throughout the United States.  "Instead, the complication and
  death rates would be much lower" because of improvements in "medical
  care for abortion complications" and in "the abortion techniques
  used ... illegal abortionists would continue to use the suction curettage
  that is used in legal abortion clinics today." This means that "illegal
  abortions performed by physician/abortionists will be no more dangerous than legal abortion - they will only be far less common, and that
  alone will save lives and reduce complications."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#24>24</A></SUP>

<P>       Fewer women proportionately are dying from abortions now than
  before, not because of legalization, but because of improvements in medicine.  Dr. Willke tells us: "With penicillin, the number [of deaths] dropped
  sharply. . . . " The general decline in deaths "was clearly due to better
  antibiotics, the establishment of intensive care units, better surgical
  techniques, etc."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#25>25</A></SUP>
       
<P>The actual number of women who died from illegal abortions prior
  to legalization is far lower than is sometimes claimed by pro-abortion
  groups.  Dr. Bernard Nathanson, in the past a leader in the effort to
  legalize abortion, and now a leading opponent of abortion, tells in <EM>Aborting
  America</EM> the story of his struggles and his profound change, and that the
  high figures were an outright lie.

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        When we spoke of the [number of deaths from illegal abortions] it was
        always "5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year." I confess that I knew the
            figures were totally false, and I suppose the others did too.... But in
            the "morality" of our revolution, it was a <EM>useful</EM> figure, widely
            accepted.... The overriding concern was to get the laws eliminated,
            and anything within reason that had to be done was permissible.<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#26>26</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
           Keeping in mind that not all abortion deaths are reported, it is still
      of some interest to see what the reported figures are: "In 1967.... the
      federal government listed only 160 deaths from illegal abortion.  In the last
      year before ... [abortion was legalized throughout the country], 1972, the
      total was only 39 deaths."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#27>27</A></SUP>

<P>

<EM>      Abortion Laws <A NAME=Unenforceable>Unenforceable</A></EM>


<P>      "Laws prohibiting abortion are not enforceable.  Desperate women, denied
      legal abortions, will find ways to obtain abortions in other ways. Trying
      to ban abortion is like trying to ban alcohol: it would be Prohibition all over
      again.  The law would be flouted, creating disrespect for law in general."
       
<P>    It is simply not true that the prohibition of abortion is not enforceable.  Abortion "clinics" could be shut down; hospitals now performing
      abortions could be prevented from doing so; doctors could be prosecuted,
      jailed, and barred from practicing.  Those who counseled women to have
      abortions, and those who assisted at them, could be prosecuted.  For most
      of our history, until very recently, abortion was illegal.  Those who
      committed this crime were prosecuted.  The child in the womb received
      legal protection in the past; what was unjustly taken away from him
      should now be restored to him.
       
<P>    Perhaps what the objection has in mind is that there would be
      widespread resistance to outlawing abortion.  That should not be a factor
      in deciding law.  "We will protect you as long as it is not too difficult to do
      so, as long as such a measure meets with popular approval." Imagine
      saying this to a minority suffering discrimination.  Persons must be given
      equality before the law because it is demanded by justice, not because (or
      only if) it is easy.

<P>           The protection of certain rights is more difficult to enforce than that
      of others.  It is easier to protect a person's right not to be beaten or killed
      in a public place than it is to protect the right of a child against child abuse
      at home.  But the law must stand with equal clarity and firmness in both
      cases.  The case of the child in the womb is similar to the child at home:
      both are more difficult to protect than an adult or child in a public place.
      But the essential point remains, that both should be protected, and
      protected equally.

<P> "Desperate women will flout the law and try to have abortions
  anyway." In general, some people desperate to do something prohibited
  by law will try to do it anyway, and some of them will succeed.  This is
  surely not a reason to have no law.  Consider rape.  Some desperate men
  will commit this crime anyway, even though it is illegal.  Making rape
  illegal does not eliminate it.  However different the psychology and
  motivation may be in the two cases, the effects on the victim are
  comparable: a violation of the intimacy and integrity of an innocent
  person.  Such attacks on the person must be prohibited by law, that some
  people will disobey the law is tragic, but is not the point here.
       
<P> Most women are not "desperate women (who] will flout the law." As
  was cited above, seventy-five percent of women seeking legal abortion
  .said they definitely would not have sought an illegal abortion." These are
  the women who are, to a large extent, "<EM>protected</EM> from being pressured
  into an abortion" by its illegality.<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#28>28</A></SUP>
       
<P> Trying to outlaw abortion is like bringing Prohibition back."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#29>29</A></SUP> This
  is simply not true, for a number of reasons.  First, the aim of Prohibition
  was to prohibit the consumption of alcoholic beverages.  This is largely a
  private matter, where the state has no clear and evident right to interfere.
  In direct contrast to this, abortion is not a private matter, but the killing
  of one person by others.
       
<P> Second, even if prohibition of alcohol were justified, it would not be
  required as a fundamental principle of law.  Prohibiting murder, all
  murder, is required as a fundamental principle of law.
       
<P> Third, a basic defect of Prohibition (of alcohol) was the confusion
  between a practice and its abuse.  What Prohibition wanted to eliminate
  was the <EM>abuse</EM> of alcohol; what it actually prohibited was <EM>alcohol itself</EM>.
  No such confusion, or even distinction, exists in regard to abortion.  It is
  abortion itself that is a terrible crime; there is no question of any abuse.
       
<P> Finally. there is the charge that making abortion illegal would mean
  widespread flouting of the law, and a consequent loss of respect for the
  law.  On the contrary, when the law fails to recognize a whole class of
  human beings as persons before the law, when it fails to protect their
  rights, it invites disrespect.  The law must protect <EM>all</EM> fundamental human
  rights.  It cannot hesitate in one area out of fear of disrespect.

	Discrimination Against the Poor
	</EM>
	<P>

	<!-- Body text goes here -->

  "If abortion is made illegal, the rich will still be able to get an abortion, for
  example by traveling to another country where it is legal, while the poor
  will be unable to.  This is unfair discrimination."


<P>          The first point to stress is that the difference involved here is not a
   matter of discrimination, of being unfair.  That applies when the law itself
   discriminates.  But when the law applies equally to all persons it is not
   discriminatory, even though compliance is unequal.  Generally, the rich
   can often evade a law that the poor cannot evade (e.g., by hiring expensive
   lawyers who can find loopholes in the law).  That is a defect in law
   enforcement, not in the content of the law. The issue here is the content
   of the law: should it recognize and protect all persons? That question is
   not answered by pointing to something quite general, namely, that,
   whatever the law says, whatever its content, the rich are often in a position
   to evade it in a way that the poor are not.  This is an injustice perpetrated
   by the rich.  It has nothing to do with the question of what the law should
   say, what it should allow or forbid.  Sexual exploitation of children, for
   example, must be prohibited, as a matter of principle, because it violates
   their rights, rights the state is required to uphold and defend.  That a rich
   person can evade the law prohibiting this in a way a poor person cannot
   is completely beside the point.  <EM>Neither</EM> should be allowed to do it.  If there
   is a discrepancy, the rich person should be brought to where the poor
   person is: prevented from committing such a crime.  Not the other way
   around: allowing the poor person to do what the rich person already
   manages to do.

<P>        This is what applies to abortion.  If abortion is the horrible crime that
   it has been shown to be, then neither rich nor poor women should be
   allowed to perpetrate it.  They should be made equal, not by allowing the
   poor to kill their preborn babies but by more vigorous enforcement to
   prevent the rich from doing so.

<P>        Discrimination means the denial of a right that one really has.  Poor
   women (and all women) have no right to kill their preborn babies.  The real
   discrimination is against the child when killing him is allowed by law. This
   is the discrimination that must be prohibited - the discrimination that
   means the denial of his most fundamental right, the right to live.

<P>

<EM>   Illegal Abortion Would Create <A NAME=Havoc>Havoc</A></EM>


<P>   "Making abortion illegal would create havoc with existing laws and
   systems; e.g., the census, apportionment of legislatures or services based
   on population, tax law."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#30>30</A></SUP>
       
<P> This is simply not true.  Many of these items would be unaffected by
   the enactment of a law recognizing preborn persons and upholding their
   right to live.  An example is apportionment of legislatures, which can
   continue to be based on the number of born persons.  Generally, we can
  legitimately make legal distinctions between born and preborn persons in
  some respects, without condemning preborn persons to the status of 
non-persons who may be legally destroyed.  We legitimately distinguish
  between minors who cannot vote and adults who can, without declaring
  minors to be non-persons who may be legally destroyed.  Precisely the
  same thing applies to a sub-class of minors: preborn babies.

<P>       Some of these, and possibly other similar items may be affected by
  enactment of the legal recognition that is due to preborn persons.  So be
  it. If we owe them a service let us give it to them.  Making the necessary
  adjustment would not create havoc, but would be a requirement of justice.
       
<P>Above all, the reciting of such a list should not obscure the
  elementary point, that we owe the child in the womb recognition as a
  person, and the equal protection of law that flows from it.

<P>

<EM>  Legal Status of Unborn Would Limit Women's <A NAME=Freedom>Freedom</A></EM>


<P>  "If the fetus is granted legal status equal to other persons, would pregnant
  women be forbidden to smoke, since that has a harmful effect on the
  fetus? Would they be forbidden to do other things that might have harmful
  side effects on the fetus?  Such prohibitions are absurd, an invasion of a
  woman's privacy.  In any case, they are impossible to enforce."

<P>       It is true, as the objection assumes, that it is morally wrong to do
  things like smoking that adversely affect the child.  The child has a right
  that such things not be done to him.  It is a new question whether this right
  can be, and should be, enshrined in the law.  Perhaps it should not be, and
  cannot be, because of the privacy factor.  If so, that hardly means that
  another right the child has should not be enshrined in law, namely the
  right to live, the right not to be murdered.  From the unfeasibility of
  protecting the first right, nothing whatever follows regarding the second
  right.  Not all rights can be given the protection of law, but some surely can,
  especially the right not to be murdered.
       
<P>A born child has a right to good health care, proper diet, protection
  from harmful effects.  To some extent this right can be enshrined in law,
  to a large extent it cannot.  We cannot have police at the family dinner table
  ensuring that the child gets all the nourishing food and vitamins he needs.
  Nor can he be protected from all harmful effects in the home, parallel to
  the harmful effects for the preborn child from his mother's smoking.  But
  surely the born child's right to live must be enshrined in the law, and given
  the same legal protection the rest of us enjoy.  Exactly the same applies
  to that child before he is born.

<P>        It is interesting that this objection argues equally against the
    pro-abortion view that the being in the womb is only a potential
    person and not an actual person.  For the harm done to the "fetus" by
    the pregnant woman's smoking will be manifest, and will be
    suffered, when that being is a person after birth.  Even if he is not a person
    before birth, as this position holds, he is surely a person after birth, and
    suffers then because of the adverse effects of his mother's smoking
    before his birth.  So the wrongness of smoking while pregnant is in no
    way removed, or even mitigated, by adopting the view that no person is
    present in the womb.  Correspondingly, if smoking is already wrong on
    the assumption that the "fetus" is merely a potential person, nothing
    significant is changed or added when we come to realize that he is
    already a real person, an actual person.  Hence the objection is not
    peculiar to the position defended here, that the being in the womb is a
    real person, entitled to the same legal status and protection as the rest
    of us.

<P>        Can a pregnant woman undergo medical treatment or take medication that is beneficial to her, but has a harmful side effect on the child?
    In some cases, yes, in some cases, no.  I suggest three principles to help
    decide such cases: (A) The woman and her child must be treated equally
    as persons. (B) We must try to benefit both as much as possible. (C)
    Proportionality must be observed.  A harmful side effect for one person
    must not be caused that is out of proportion to the good effect intended
    for the other person.



<P><EM>    Illegal Abortion Would Make All <A NAME=Miscarriages>Miscarriages</A> Suspect</EM>


<P>    "If abortion were made illegal it would 'perhaps require women who
    had spontaneous abortions [miscarriages] (and their doctors) to undergo special scrutiny to prove that they were in no way induced.'"<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#31>31</A></SUP>
       
<P>  If there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the spontaneous abortion was indeed deliberately induced, there should be a
    special scrutiny; for inducement of abortion means that a small child
    had been deliberately killed.  Deliberately killing him should be
    treated just like deliberately killing any child.  If there are no reasonable grounds for suspecting a deliberate killing, there would be no scrutiny.  This is precisely the same situation as the death of a born baby
    from an accident at home. If there are reasonable grounds for
    suspecting that the accident was deliberately caused, there will be, and
    should be, an investigation.  If not, there will not be.


<P>   <EM>Illegal Abortion Would Proscribe Certain <A NAME=Treatments>Treatments</A></EM>


<P>   "If abortion were made illegal, it would mean that treatment for certain
   medical conditions would be proscribed if the treatment had an abortifacient side effect."<SUP><A HREF=notes13.htm#32>32</A></SUP>
       
<P> The force of the objection assumes the pro-abortion position, that
   women have the right to bring about the death of the child within them.
   Once this assumption is removed, the objection collapses.  A woman does
   not have the right to a treatment that benefits her while killing the child.
   One cannot benefit B by killing innocent person A, as has been noted so
   often already.  The objection arises because one does not recognize the
   reality of the child.  Imagine someone suggesting the converse of this: a
   treatment for certain medical conditions in the child that would have the
   side effect of killing the woman. The term <EM>abortifacient side effect</EM> does not
   sound so bad, until one realizes what it means: a human person is being
   killed.
       
<P> The reply to this objection is simply that such medical treatments
   should be proscribed if they include the killing of the child, just as any
   treatment, or any action, should be proscribed if it includes the killing of
   an innocent person.



<P><EM>   Illegal Abortion Would Prohibit Certain <A NAME=Contraceptives>Contraceptives</A></EM>


<P>         "If abortion were made illegal, specifically, if it were declared that
   human life begins at conception-fertilization, that would make illegal
   certain kinds of contraception, such as the IUD and some oral contraceptives (such as the Morning After Pill)."
       
<P> The first point to make is that this formulation of the objection (which
   is common) confuses two essentially different terms: <EM>contraception</EM>, which
   means preventing the coming to be of a new person, and <EM>abortion</EM>,
   including abortifacients, which means destroying an already existing
   person.  Outlawing abortion would in no way affect what are really
   contraceptives.  It would outlaw abortifacients such as the IUD and the
   Morning After Pill, which destroy a tiny human person.
       
<P> The reply to the objection applying only to abortifacients is that
   making abortion illegal would indeed outlaw the IUD, the Morning After
   Pill, and other abortifacients.  If the child is recognized as a person from
   the very beginning - despite his small size, lack of development, and
   inability to function as a person - his right to live, his right not to be killed
   should be recognized also.  If our right to live is enshrined in law, his right
   should likewise be enshrined in law.  It is very easy, and often very
    convenient, to kill a preborn child by an IUD, while it is generally difficult,
    especially psychologically to kill an older person.  That is hardly a morally
    relevant difference.  It is unfair to take advantage of a person's small size
    and inability to defend himself in order to kill him.  It is likewise unfair to
    deny a tiny child the legal protection we enjoy.

<P>         Protecting a child from death by IUD or the Morning After Pill is much
    more difficult than protecting him from death by D & C, saline, and other
    surgical killings.  But the principle is the same: the child must be
    protected by the law.  There must be a legal prohibition on the manufacture, transport, distribution, possession, and use of IUD's, Morning
    After Pills, and other death-dealing devices.  That which has as its sole
    purpose the destruction of a small person cannot be legally tolerated.
    That enforcement of such a prohibition will be difficult is no argument
    against it.  Protecting babies from child abuse in the home is also difficult
    in terms of enforcement, but is of course absolutely imperative.

If abortion is made a criminal act under the law, should it be declared
murder?  Should the penalties be the same as for other cases of murder?
How should they apply to the doctor?  How should they apply to the
woman?

<P><OL><LI>Abortion is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being.  It
is a case of murder.  It must be called by its proper name, both in the moral
and legal order.  Anything less is an injustice to the child.  The seriousness
of the charge of murder is a reflection of the seriousness with which we
take the reality of the victim of the killing.  Preborn babies are not lesser
persons - they are our equals.  Killing a child before birth is as much
murder as killing that child, or anyone else, after birth.  The law must
reflect and express this.  It must call abortion by its proper term: murder.

<P><LI>A doctor deliberately kills a sick five-year old child.  A second doctor
kills a newborn baby.  A third doctor deliberately kills a preborn baby.
Surely the first doctor commits murder.  And the second? Of course.  There
is no morally relevant difference.  And the third?  Again it is murder, there
is no morally relevant difference.  The only difference between the three is
that the child is a bit younger and smaller in each succeeding case, and
in a different environment in the third case.  But the horror of the deed,
the gravity of the offense is the same in all three cases. The third has a
different name, <EM>abortion</EM>, and perhaps a different psychological appearance, but 
it is of the same nature as the other two.

<P>     Doctors who perform abortions are hired killers, paid professional
killers.  They should be indicted for first-degree murder just as in all other
cases of deliberate, premeditated murder.  The penalties for doctors for
killing preborn babies should be the same as the penalties for killing born
persons.  Only in this way do we grant the preborn child the equal
treatment he or she deserves.

<P>          Does this judgment sound harsh?  If so, is it because we do not
     seriously consider the child to be a person?  If we do, does it still seem
     harsh?  If we recognize that the doctor is deliberately killing a small child
     who cannot defend herself, who is ruthlessly crushed because the doctor
     has the power to destroy her, how can we say that the doctor's deed is
     anything but murder?

<P>          Recall the horror of abortion, how the child is cut to pieces,
     dismembered by suction, or subjected to being burned all over her body
     for one to two hours, and then ask: Where is the harshness?  In the
     judgment on the doctor, or in what the doctor does to the child?
       
<P>   It goes without saying that any doctor who kills a preborn child
     should immediately be suspended from the medical community and
     barred from any further medical practice.  He has violated his professional
     trust and obligation in the most fundamental way.  Medicine exists to heal
     and save people, not to kill them.  A greater contradiction to the spirit and
     essence of that noble profession can hardly be imagined.

<P>          A doctor who performs an abortion may see it as a service for the
     woman, an act on her behalf.  This has to do with the motive of the agent;
     it does not affect the nature of the action.  That action is still murder, and
     should be declared so under the law.  A doctor who kills a handicapped
     newborn baby may also do it as a service to the parents, perhaps out of
     compassion.  Whatever the status of his motive, his deed is clearly
     murder, the deliberate killing of a helpless infant.  Abortion is no different.

<P><LI>Let us turn to the question of penalties for women.  On the one
     hand, as I have shown, women are in various ways the second victims.
     They are often pressured; they turn to abortion because they are not
     supported and see no alternative.  Far from being a genuine choice,
     abortion is often an act of desperation.  Women are often devastated in
     many ways, by feelings of guilt, regret, depression, and by physical
     damage.  Abortion is a terrible assault on the woman, psychologically and
     physically.  One might easily say they have suffered enough.  Moreover,
     women are often unaware of the full reality of the child, and how horrible
     abortion is for the child.  All these are surely mitigating factors.

<P>          On the other hand, we must not retreat from the stand that abortion
     is murder, and, therefore, that the woman in choosing abortion participates in 
murder.  Women themselves sometimes say, "I have murdered my
     baby," or something similar.
       
<P>   "But is it not an extreme and harsh view that would treat women who
     have abortions as murderers?" This is sometimes asked by defenders of
     abortion as an objection to making abortion illegal: "It would treat women
     as murderers." It is assumed that any sensible person will immediately
     see that this is absurd.

<P>       But is it?  If we recall what a horrible act abortion is, as we have
  repeatedly stressed here, any apparent absurdity will quickly vanish.
  Abortion is murder, and therefore all those who are involved in it are
  involved in murder.  It is not my judgment that makes the killing of an
  innocent human being murder, but the facts of the case itself. The alleged
  absurdity here comes from failing to see the reality of the child in the
  womb and the horror of deliberately killing her.  Given this horror, how can
  abortion be anything but murder?
       
<P>Part of this question/objection stems from the idea that we should
  have pity on the woman.  Indeed we should.  But to call such an action
  murder is not to contradict pity.  If a desperate person kills an innocent
  person, we can have great pity on him; we do not judge him harshly, and
  yet we say his deed was murder.  Pity is a response to the person; the
  question of murder pertains to the nature of the action. The action, if it
  is the deliberate killing of an innocent person, does not cease to be murder
  because we have pity on the person who committed it, or the person
  involved in it.
       
<P>We should pity the woman who has an abortion.  And the child! We
  should have the same concern for the child that we naturally have for the
  woman.  If what is done to the child in abortion were done to the woman,
  we would be outraged.  We would surely call it murder, regardless of who
  did it, or why that person did it.  We must be equally outraged at what is
  actually done to the child, and we must call it murder as well.
       
<P><LI>At first the two aspects - calling abortion murder, recognizing that
  women who choose abortion are involved in murder; and having pity on
  women as second victims of abortion - may seem contradictory or opposed.  I 
think that on a deeper level they unite.  The law must recognize
  abortion in all its seriousness and apply penalties that reflect this.  This
  is not only in response to the child as the primary victim, to protect him,
  but also in response to the woman, the second victim, to protect her.
  Paradoxical as it may seem, we can have pity on women by recognizing
  abortion as murder, with appropriate penalties.  It is a way of conveying
  the message that abortion is a terrible thing, from which women must be
  protected. "Do not commit murder" is a powerful warning.

<P><LI>In all of this I have not spelled out what the penalties for abortion
  should be, for the doctor and for the woman.  That is a topic beyond the
  scope of this book, belonging to other subjects, the ethics of punishment
  and criminology.  I have argued for two main points: equal treatment for
  the preborn child, that killing her be treated as murder, just like the
  killing of a born child, or any other person: and protection for the woman.
  Whatever penalties are imposed must reflect this, as well as take into
  account any relevant mitigating factors, just as in all other cases of
    murder.  There are, however, several points that should be made in regard
    to the question just raised.

<P>        First, the severity of the penalty should reflect the seriousness of the
    crime.  The gravity of the penalty is a measure of the seriousness with
    which we take the offense. If we value human life, we must impose a
    corresponding penalty on those who would deliberately destroy it.
       
<P> Second, should we pity the criminal?  A tension between pity and
    justice runs through the whole of the criminal justice system.  The rapist
    who evokes our wrath may also evoke our pity if we look into his rniserably
    unhappy childhood, and if we see him harshly punished.  This tension is
    a very general one, not confined to any single type of crime.  And it is not,
    I think, easily resolved.  The pity/justice tension that we see in the case
    of abortion, pity for the woman, justice in response to the murder of the
    child, is part of this general tension. It should be seen as such, and not
    as something special.  And neither element should completely overshadow 
the other, as when pity for the woman leads to a denial that the
    abortion she requests is a case of murder.
       
<P> Third, consistent with justice, the penalty for a crime should be
    severe enough to provide maximum deterrence against committing it.  The
    principles here are the same as for the murder of born persons.  Murder
    of the preborn must be punished in such a way as to afford the potential
    victims the maximum protection of the deterrent effect of law, consistent
    with justice.  This is the kind of protection we owe the woman; and her
    preborn child.
       
<P> Finally, as in all cases of killing, the severity of the penalty should
    also reflect all the relevant factors of the individual case.  All the elements
    that make women the second victims of abortion enter here as mitigating
    factors.  In some cases, similar considerations may also apply to the
    doctor.  As a general rule, however, it seems to me that the penalties
    should be more severe for the doctor than for the woman.  As noted, the
    doctor is a hired killer, and should be treated as such.
       
<P>  The question of penalties for women is an agonizing one.  In trying to
    resolve it, I suggest we keep in mind the four points immediately above,
    paying special attention to the second: pity for the woman, but also a
    concern for justice.<SUP><A HREF=notes14.htm#1>1</A></SUP>

  Should the law prohibiting abortion allow for exceptions?  Specifically, to
    save the life of the woman and in cases of pregnancy due to rape or incest?
    A law incorporating such exceptions is advocated either because its
proponents feel that such exceptions are justified and called for, or
because they believe no other law is possible, that a law that mandates
an exceptionless prohibition stands no chance of passage.  They then
argue that it is better to have a law that bans almost all abortions, and
saves many lives, than the present situation (in the United States, and in
much of the rest of the world) in which there is, in effect, abortion on
demand.  "Better to save most babies and allow a few to be killed, than to
allow the number of abortions we have today."

<P>      The motives of such people are noble.  They want to save as many lives
as possible.  And surely it is better to save some than none at all.  If a
thousand innocent people are about to be exterminated by the Nazis, and
we can rescue only some, we should, of course, do so: better to save some
than none at all.  But is an abortion prohibition with an exception clause
parallel to this?
     
<P> In analyzing the question of exceptions.  I will begin with the rape/incest 
case, then discuss the "life of the mother" case, and finally the
question of exceptions regarding the IUD and other abortifacients.
      
<P>A law is enacted that says, in effect: Abortion is wrong; it is
prohibited, except if the woman is pregnant due to rape or incest.  Then
abortion is permitted.  What it says is that it is wrong to kill almost all
babies in the womb, but all right to kill a few.  For a child conceived in rape
or incest, the law says, "You may kill this child for the benefit of his
mother."
      
<P>Even in the case of rape or incest, there is a child present, a real
person, essentially like the rest of us.  Abortion is murder, and remains
murder when the victim is conceived in rape (or incest).  The child is
absolutely innocent, completely her own person, not a part of her father's
character, just as she is not a part of her mother's body.  Even assuming
abortion benefits the woman, we cannot kill one innocent person to
benefit another.  The child has no duty to give up her life to try to benefit
her mother, and we may therefore not force her to do so by killing her.  If
we do not kill the rapist for his crime, still less should we kill the child who
has committed no crime.  Abortion for rape is not a solution because it is
an assault on the woman, a cure that aggravates the disease, and because
it does not address the real problem of rape pregnancies (the social stigma
against the woman and her child).  And finally, abortion in the case of rape
is more of the same: first a horrible violence against the woman, then a
horrible violence against the child.  For all these reasons, abortion in the
case of rape (and incest) is not justified.
      
<P>The child in the womb conceived in rape or incest has the same right
to have her life protected by law as anyone else has.  This means there can
be no exception in the law for rape or incest.  There are two fundamental
   reasons for this, one concerning the principle at stake, the other, the
   practical effects.  The second follows naturally from the first.

<P>        First, the question of principle.  A law that incorporates the rape/incest 
exception means that murder is given the blessing of law in certain
   cases.  "Yes, go ahead, you can murder this child, since his conception was
   due to rape." The law can never allow murder.  A law that does so is not
   only a gross injustice in itself but also a contradiction to the very meaning
   of law, the upholding of what is right and just in the public domain.  That
   is, the whole law prohibiting abortion would be fatally flawed by this
   exception clause.  Such a law could never be a genuine prohibition of
   murder of the child when it makes an about face and says, "Yes, you can
   murder this child." The exception clause would mean the breakdown of
   the entire law.  It would no longer have a foundation to stand on.  It would
   not be like the removal of one checker from a board of checkers, leaving
   the rest intact.  It would be like removing the foundation of a building: the
   whole building would collapse.  For the foundation of the law banning
   abortion is that abortion is murder. If the law allows murder, it has
   destroyed itself.
       
<P> Such a law admits that abortion can be justified under certain
   circumstances, namely rape or incest.  But if in these circumstances, why
   not also others? The question is surely a reasonable one.  And with it we
   come to the second part: the practical effects of a law that allows the 
rape/incest exception.  There are six specific points:
       
<P><OL><LI>Such a law will be challenged.  On what basis is abortion to be
   prohibited in all other cases?  Is it because there is a child there, and
   abortion is murdering that child, and the law may not allow murder?  But
   that applies equally to the child conceived in rape.  If abortion in such a
   case is allowed, the reason just given can't be the basis of the prohibition.
   By allowing murder, the law defeats itself.  It invites a challenge that is not
   only perfectly reasonable, but cannot be met by those who agree with the
   exception law.

<P>        That is, in proposing or agreeing to an exception law, we would
   surrender everything that is essential to protecting any infant in the
   womb.  We would forfeit our chance to enact any legal protection for
   preborn infants.  We would grant our opponents who favor allowing
   abortion the idea that the child may be killed for the benefit of another.
   Granted, we would be conceding this in only one area, but it would be the
   crack in the door.
       
<P><LI>If the exception for rape or incest is granted, should we then
   have another exception based upon pain and trauma from other causes?
   To deny such a request at this point would be impossible.  If trauma and
   pain due to one cause are to serve as a reason for permitting abortion,
 then the similar trauma and pain for another cause must be given the
 same privilege.

<P>      There is a further, very serious problem.  How much pain and trauma
 are to be counted as sufficient?  How are they to be measured?  Who is to
 decide?  The decision will be left to a psychiatrist and other doctors.  In
 practical terms, it will mean that a woman seeking an abortion has only
 to find a doctor willing to certify, in his professional judgment, that she
 needs an abortion for psychological reasons.  When she does, no one will
 be able to dispute this doctor's claim.  We will no longer be able to appeal
 to the state for protection for the innocent.  We will have surrendered that
 element in the law that allows for exceptions.

<P>      The first of the two fundamental reasons for rejecting a law with
 exceptions, namely, that it violates principle, is no idle or stubborn
 clinging to the abstract, in disregard for practical consequences in the real
 world.  On the contrary, the principle that <EM>all</EM> persons must be respected,
 that <EM>all</EM> murder must be condemned by state law, is needed for practical
 reasons.  Abandoning the principle has disastrous consequences in the
 real world, consequences which flow directly from the surrender of the
 principle.

<P>      It may be claimed that abortion for rape is essentially different from
 all other abortions to benefit the woman, because in rape she was unjustly
 coerced.  The presence of the child in her represents an injustice, and
 therefore she may remove him.  Two wrongs, however, do not make a right;
 I cannot try to undo a wrong done against me by doing another wrong -
 especially murder - against another person.  The woman cannot try to
 undo the wrong done by killing the rapist, or the innocent child.  Allowing
 such killing in the name of undoing a wrong is a violation of the principle
 that all innocent persons must be respected and protected.  Holding fast
 to this principle is not only important in itself but also essential for
 practical reasons.
      
<P><LI>Will a rape exception law require proof that the woman was
 actually raped?  If the answer is yes, there are insuperable objections and
 difficulties.  She may be unable to prove it for lack of witnesses.  The rapist
 might not get caught; and even if he is, it is her word against his, with no
 proof. Forcing her to go through court proceedings is wrong and unrealistic.  
Even if it were expected, and the woman were forced to submit to it
 before she could get the abortion, it would take too long.  The baby would
 be far along in development and suffer a late-term abortion.  The proceedings 
might even take longer than the pregnancy itself, thus nullifying the
 whole intent of the law.

<P>      It is clear from this that no requirement for proof could be written into
 the exception law.  This means that a woman could legally claim an
     abortion on the basis of rape without proof.  The mere claim of rape would
     suffice.  It is easy to predict what will happen.  Women who feel they need
     an abortion could claim rape and get their abortions.  Family members
     and others who feel the woman needs an abortion could pressure her into
     claiming rape.  We would be back to where we are now: abortion on
     demand.

<P>         It may be charged that I take a cynical view here, saying that
     women will lie in order to get an abortion.  Those women who claim
     abortion as a right will understandably see in the restriction to rape
     clause an unwarranted intrusion into their privacy, a provision in the law
     put there in order to appease those who want to forbid abortion. They will
     feel justified in trying to evade this restriction.  "If a woman who has been
     raped can get an abortion, why can't I?" The same applies if it is others
     who pressure her into an abortion.  If we surrender the principle that
     abortion must be prohibited as murder, that every child in the womb is
     entitled to the same protection of law that we are entitled to, we really have
     no answer to this question.  In comparison with the horror of abortion
     itself, and the terrible violation of justice of allowing some preborn
     persons to be killed with the blessing of the law, a woman lying in order
     to obtain an abortion is very insignificant indeed.
       
<P><LI>We are now in a good position to see the essential difference
     between a genuine concern to save as many people as possible rather than
     none at all, and a law prohibiting abortion that allows exceptions for rape
     and incest.  A thousand innocent people are condemned to die by the
     Nazis.  We have several trucks, that together hold two hundred people.  We
     can make only one trip.  We take two hundred, saving them.  We are unable
     to save the rest.  But we do not compromise those eight hundred that we
     cannot save.  We do not say to the Nazis, "It's all right, you can kill these
     people." But that is precisely what the exception clause in an abortion law
     would say.  A law containing such a clause does not merely fail to save, as
     in the case of the shortage of trucks, it gives a positive sanction to killing.
     It enshrines it in the law.  That is what is so objectionable, first as a
     violation of principle, then in its practical consequences, which are
     essentially the unfolding of the violation of the principle.  The exception
     law must be rejected because written into it is the idea that some persons
     may be murdered.

<P>          It is sometimes said that a law need not, often cannot, include all that
     should be prohibited.  Granted.  But the crucial thing, in the present
     context, is that the law cannot incorporate an immoral principle, such as
     "You may kill the child if he was conceived under certain conditions." The
     very purpose and meaning of a law prohibiting abortion is to protect every
 child, to prohibit murder.  An exception for rape is a contradiction to this,
 a negation of the very essence of the law.

<P><LI>An exception law delivers the message that it's all right to have an
 abortion under certain circumstances.  With this the whole edifice of state
 protection for preborn persons collapses. "This must mean that abortion
 isn't really murder, else it wouldn't be allowed in some cases." These are
 the thoughts that will naturally suggest themselves to people if the law to
 protect preborn persons contains exceptions.

<P>      The practical effects of such a climate of opinion are easily predictable.  
An exception law will not be respected.  It is a law that contains an
 inherent contradiction, for it is a law that both wants to prohibit murder
 (in most cases) and also to allow it (for rape and incest).  And the exceptions
 will be widened.  Why shouldn't they be, once the idea is accepted, and
 enshrined in the law, that a benefit for the woman can justify abortion?
 The exception law would not save most babies as its advocates expect.  It
 would leave us where we are, with a legal system that sanctions murder.

<P><LI>"A law containing a rape and incest exception is all we can get.
 There seems to be a consensus for that, but not for an absolute prohibition on 
abortion.  Most Americans oppose abortion on demand, but only
 a minority supports an absolute prohibition."

<P>      First, there is every reason to be confident that if the American people
 fully realize what an abortion is, they will demand an absolute prohibition
 on abortion, no exceptions.  We must make clear the reality of the child in
 the womb.  We must publicize pictures of the child that show he is one of
 us and may not be destroyed for any reason.  We must publicize pictures
 of the results of abortion.  The full impact of the horror of abortion should
 silence any thought of exceptions.  How can one stare abortion in the face
 and still suggest exceptions?
      
<P>Second, a law with exceptions is not only a violation of fundamental 
principles, it is also useless; its practical consequences will be abortion
 on demand.  If we settle for an exception law, we may not get another
 chance to enact a real prohibition on abortion.  We will have compromised
 ourselves to ultimate defeat.  We cannot let this happen.  Therefore an
 exception law is not only useless; much worse, it is something that may
 close the door to any real protection for preborn persons.
      
<P>Should the law allow an exception to save the life of the mother? This
 question has, in effect, already been answered.  Abortion is murder, and
 murder can never be sanctioned by the law.  We cannot kill the woman to
 save the child.  Equally, we cannot kill the child to save the woman.  We
 may not be able to save both, we may have to withhold treatment from one
 if it cannot be given to both, but we may never deliberately kill the one to
 save the other.

<P>       The law should incorporate the three principles discussed earlier, in
  chapter 10.  I propose it include the following section:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
       If complications arise, all reasonable efforts must be made to save
       both the woman and the child.  Each must be respected and treated
       equally as a person.  Neither may be killed for the benefit of the other,
       or in an attempt to save the life of the other.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
</OL>
<P>
       Let us turn finally to the question of exceptions regarding the IUD
  and other abortifacients.  The same principle applies here too: there can
  be no exceptions, all preborn persons must be given legal protection.
       
<P>Suppose, however, that a law prohibiting abortion that includes
  a ban on all abortifacients cannot be passed, that only a law prohibiting 
surgical abortions, including prostaglandins, can be enacted.
  Isn't it better to save most of the vast number of babies being killed
  by these methods, and forego legal protection for tiny infants who
  would be killed by abortifacients, than to have nothing at all?  In
  addition, enforcement of a ban on abortifacients would pose great
  difficulties.
       
<P>This is a difficult question.  Let me suggest the following points:
       
<P><OL><LI>Any law that is passed must be free from all the objectionable
  compromises discussed above in regard to exceptions for rape and incest.
  It cannot be a law that contains an expandable loophole.

<P><LI>Specifically, it cannot be a law that explicitly allows early
  abortions (abortifacients).  It could only be a law that omits mention of
  abortifacients and focuses on outlawing the savagery of surgical abortions.  It 
would have to be a law that represented a real parallel to the
  example above, of saving some potential victims of Nazi extermination
  while failing to save others because it is impossible to do so.

<P><LI>If such a limited law could be formulated and enacted, it would
  have to be seen as a temporary measure.  We would have to work
  vigorously to extend its prohibition to all preborn persons.

<P><LI>We should not, however, assume too readily that a law including a ban 
on abortifacients cannot be enacted.  We must make full
  use of all the arguments and evidence available to us, primarily all
  that which makes it clear that a person begins his existence at 
conception-fertilization, that the zygote-embryo-fetus is a person all the
  way through and does not become one gradually.  We should supplement 
these arguments with the probability argument (if there is
  any significant chance that the zygote is a human being essentially
  like the rest of us - and surely there is - we may not destroy him.); as
  well as with the "no difference" argument (if the child is to be killed,
 what difference does it make whether he is killed earlier or later?
 Either way he is deprived of his entire future life).  All of these provide
 an abundance of reasons to help people realize that a tiny human
 being near the beginning of his existence is a person too, essentially
 like the rest of us, and therefore entitled to the same protection of law.
</OL>
<P>      We cannot compromise on this.  The most we might do is work in
 stages, first enacting a law that recognizes the personhood of the
 victim of surgical abortions, then also the personhood of the victim of
 abortifacients.  There is some parallel to this in the case of slavery in
 America.  The first stage was freeing the slaves from their bondage, the
 second stage was granting them equal status as persons in society and
 under the law.  Necessary as this second stage is, it was wise to begin with
 the first stage if the two could not be accomplished together.  Just as it
 was better that blacks be freed from slavery, but without full civil rights,
 than continuing to be slaves, which is an even greater violation of their
 civil rights and their dignity as persons. So too it is better to save many
 babies by giving them legal protection, than to continue the present
 horror in which no preborn babies are given any protection of law.

<P>      But it must be stressed that in such cases legal recognition and
 protection of blacks and preborn persons - there can only be stages,
 and not compromises of principles.  We could never concede that a black
 person is not fully a person, or that a tiny infant is not fully a person.
 If it takes time to awaken people to the full impact of the evil in both
 cases, we must work in stages.  The first stage must be accomplished in
 such a way that it naturally leads to the second.  Abortion by D & C, saline,
 etc. means killing a small child and must therefore be outlawed.  Abortifacients 
also mean killing a child, merely a smaller child, and must
 therefore also be outlawed.

<P>     There is a difference between a rape exception law and the two-stage
 procedure tentatively suggested here.  A two-stage procedure with no
 compromises on principle goes in the right direction.  A rape exception law
 goes in the wrong direction.  The two-stage procedure affirms that
 any being who is a person must be given equal protection of law; it only
 leaves open whether a zygote is such a being.  The rape exception law must
 be condemned precisely because it denies the principle that any being
 who is a person must be given equal protection of law.  The two-stage
 procedure is thus open to full recognition of preborn persons from the very
 beginning of their existence at conception.  The rape exception law, by its
 exception clause, closes the door to any genuine and effective legal
 protection for preborn persons.

   It is argued that the government should fund abortions for poor women.
    "Not to do so is discrimination.  The rich can still get abortions while the
    poor are denied them." Again, it is said, "Abortion is cheaper than welfare.
    Poor women who want abortions should be encouraged to get them, and
    supported financially, to ease the welfare burden.  Supporting a child on
    welfare is expensive over many years."
     
<P>    It is clear that government should not fund abortions.  Funding
    abortion means paying for the killing of a small, defenseless child, a child
    who is singled out for death because he is in the way, and sometimes
    because it costs too much to support him.
       
<P>  Abortion funding is a triple evil.  First, there is the moral evil of
    abortion itself, as the murder of a small child.  Second, there is the
    additional evil that the government gives this killing its blessing by
    allowing it under the law.  Third, the government even participates in the
    crime by paying for it.
       
<P>  In reply to the objection that refusal to fund abortions for poor
    women is a form of discrimination: it is true that there should be no
    discrimination.  But this must be achieved in precisely the opposite
    direction: neither the rich nor the poor should be allowed, or encouraged,
    to kill their preborn babies.  If poor women are not able to destroy their
    preborn infants, that is good. Rich women should be in the same position.
    The law must protect all preborn babies, of rich and poor mothers alike.
       
<P>  "Abortion is cheaper than welfare." Indeed it is.  So is killing the
    handicapped, the aged who are unable to take care of themselves.  Killing
    is always cheaper than caring.  The Nazis realized this, and put it into
    practice in their program of mass extermination of handicapped children,
    the aged, and others who were "useless eaters." Let us not follow that
    path.

<EM>Looking Back and Looking Ahead</EM><P>


    When future generations look back at us, what will they see?  They will see
 a society that prided itself on being humane and concerned for human
 rights, but one that also engaged in the practice of killing small children
 by dismemberment or poisoning/burning.  It did not do this to all its
 children, just certain ones, who were still in the first phase of their lives.
 It was a practice called abortion. One would think that such a practice,
 with its ghastly methods, would be outlawed.  It was not; it was perfectly
 legal.  In fact the individual states were forbidden by the Supreme Court
 to outlaw it and protect these children.  Many in the society welcomed this,
 for they wanted to keep the practice "safe" and legal.  Didn't they find it odd
 to refer to a practice that destroys little children as "safe"?

<P>      It was a society that held up very high standards in condemning
 discrimination against people merely because they were in some way
 different from those who happened to be the majority, such as in skin
 color.  But it was also a society that treated some of its members very
 differently from others because they were different: much smaller, much
 more dependent than the majority, and not in a familiar environment.
 They were treated differently in that they could be killed if they did not fit
 into others' plans.

<P>      Perhaps that was part of the explanation why a practice that kills
 a child was called safe: the child doesn't count as a real person because
 she is different (too small, etc.). In other cases such an attitude would
 be vigorously condemned as discrimination.  Here it was approved,
 and often strongly supported.  Laws that allowed people to murder babies
 were called liberal, while in other contexts that term referred (among
 other things) to the protection of those who could not protect themselves.

<P>           The child was not taken seriously as a real person.  Perhaps that
    explains how those who favored this practice would vigorously defend "a
    woman's right to choose." They called themselves "Pro-Choice," thus
    conveniently avoiding any reference to the killing of the child.  They would
    ordinarily defend choice only in personal matters that did not adversely
    affect others.  They would never defend a right to choose to kill a person,
    or to discriminate against a person.
       
<P>    It was a society that itself looked back on a horror scene, a holocaust
    where some six million people were exterminated.  It was aghast at what
    it saw, and kept saying "Never again!" It did not see that essentially the
    same thing was going on in its own neighborhoods.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes_ep.htm#1>1</A></SUP>
       
<P>    This is what they will see.  What will they say?  Probably many things.
    One of them being, "Why didn't those people who did see abortion for what
    it is do something?" That brings us back to the present, where we can look
    ahead to the future.  For us the question is: what must we do now to end
    the mass abortion killings?  Let me suggest the following Call to Action.

<P><OL><LI>We must awaken the American people to what is happening.  Two
    things should be stressed: the reality of the child and how abortion kills
    the child, the ghastly methods and their results.  A major part of this
    education campaign should be pictures of the child.  In so many cases,
    seeing is believing.  If a woman sees her child, she may change her mind
    about having an abortion.  Dr. Bernard Nathanson discusses an article in
    the <EM>New England Journal of Medicine</EM>, which reported an 
interview:


<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
           [T]wo women in the early part of pregnancy ... were privileged to watch
           their infants on an ultrasound screen.  The women were asked if they
           would still entertain the thought of abortion after having seen their
           babies move, breathe, and do all those inexpressibly endearing things
           that all babies do, born or unborn.  Both women categorically rejected
           the abortion option, one stating: "I feel that it is human.  It belongs to
           me. I couldn't have an abortion now."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes_ep.htm#2>2</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
           We must stress that abortion is not a private matter.  Joseph
    Scheidler urges us to "develop an educational program that concentrates
    on the unborn child as an unseen victim.  It is essential that this victim
    becomes a real person in the mind of the community.  The more the
    unborn is acknowledged, the less tolerant the community will be of taking
    that person's life."<SUP><A HREF=notes_ep.htm#3>3</A></SUP>
       
<P>    Why do those who support abortion not see its victim as a real
    person? I think a major factor is prejudice. We must work to overcome this
    prejudice where it exists, and a good first step is to understand it.
    Germain Grisez, in his excellent treatise, "Abortion and Prejudice against
   the Unborn" explains: "Prejudice takes advantage of a difference" between
   "those who are prejudiced" and "those against whom there is prejudice."
   Those who are prejudiced are so for "an intelligible motive" that explains
   the "development and persistence" of the prejudice.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes_ep.htm#4>4</A></SUP> For abortion there
   is an obvious motive: the desire to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          While prejudiced people are not simply dishonest, they act as if they
          suspected the truth and were trying to avoid facing it.  People who are
          racially prejudiced do not like to be shown facts and have a hard time
          following arguments that might dislodge their prejudice.  This resistance is 
always surprising, especially when it is encountered (as often
          happens) in persons who are extremely perceptive and logical in other
          matters.<SUP><A HREF=notes_ep.htm#5>5</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
          The same applies to prejudice against the unborn.  Further, "a
   system built on prejudice is never consistent."<SUP><A 
HREF=notes_ep.htm#6>6</A></SUP> People who are pro-abortion are 
generally very strongly opposed to racial prejudice.  Perhaps
   that helps to assure them that they themselves can't be prejudiced.  But,
   in fact, prejudice is a universal human danger, which any of us can fall
   into.
       
<P>   To speak of prejudice here is not to level a charge against persons
   who favor abortion; it is simply a way of trying to understand an aspect
   of the pro-abortion mentality.  How can people favor allowing babies to be
   killed? The viewpoint of prejudice helps to provide an answer.
       
<P>   There is also, I think, the fact that many people do not support
   abortion as a conclusion from a process of reasoning.  Rather, they first
   decide that abortion is necessary or desirable, then find reasons to
   support this view.  One such reason is the so-called unreality of the "fetus"
   as a person.  That, in turn, is a prejudice against the unborn.
       
<P>   In addition to those who explicitly favor abortion, there is a large
   majority who are complacent.  They are in between, neither actively 
pro-abortion nor filled with outrage at this horror.  They must be awakened to
   a response of outrage, and inspired to form a movement to end this mass
   killing.  They must come to see abortion in a new way.  According to
   Brennan:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          As long as abortion remains at the psychologically-remote and
          abstract level of removing insignificant tissue or contents from the
          womb, not that many people are likely to get upset.  The holocaust
          perspective, on the other hand, possesses a tremendous potential for
          breaking through this facade and revealing the harsh realities of 
large-scale killing, whatever the historical period of their perpetration, and
          whether the victims be born or unborn.  Only when people are allowed
         access to the concrete, emotionally repugnant facts of unborn baby
         killing will they be filled with outrage and motivated to demand an end
         to the destruction .<SUP><A HREF=notes_ep.htm#7>7</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
        One of the most important tasks is devising ways of reaching the
   American people with a message to awaken them to the reality of the
   child-killing that is politely referred to as abortion.  Perhaps a mass
   mailing can be arranged.  A vital part of this message is a call to action:
   "If you are outraged at abortion, then ________," specifying what a
   person should do.
       
<P><LI>We must prepare a program of political action for ending the mass
   killing.  We must prepare bills to be introduced in Congress.  We must
   devise strategies for reversing court decisions that protect the alleged
   right to kill instead of the rights of the victim.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes_ep.htm#8>8</A></SUP> We can then focus people's
   energy into specific programs: support this bill, call this government
   official, etc.

<P><LI>In pursuing the first two steps, our objective must be clear: full
   membership of preborn children in the community (full status as persons
   and full protection under the law).  There can be no compromise on this.
   The child can never be killed to benefit the woman or others, any more
   than the woman or others could be killed to benefit the child.

<P>        It is essential that legal protection for preborn persons be written into
   the Constitution, so that no future court or legislature can ever deprive
   them of it again.  There must be a Constitutional amendment that
   specifically states that preborn children are persons and entitled to full
   legal protection.  Three elements are essential:
       
<P> One, the amendment must restore personhood to the unborn child.
   Two, it must clearly apply from the beginning of life, conception-fertilization. 
Three, its prohibition of abortion-killing must contain no
   exceptions.<SUP><A HREF=notes_ep.htm#9>9</A></SUP>
       
<P><LI>It will be said that this objective cannot be achieved all at once.
   If this is so, we should work in stages, doing what we can at each
   stage and continuing until our task is complete.  It is important to be
   clear on the difference between this approach and one that accepts
   compromises.  We might, for example, start out with a law that bans
   saline abortions: they are so horrible that it is hard to believe they are
   used, and even sanctioned by law.  Someone who is unclear whether or
   not the "fetus" is a person could still see the horror of doing this to any
   living creature, for whom the evidence (presence of nerve endings, etc.)
   is overwhelming that it feels excruciating pain, and for a considerable
   time.  A law banning the saline method would not condone other
   abortions; it would simply not mention them.  Once this is accomplished, we 
must work in stages to forbid other types of abortion as
well.

<P>      Working for such a law does not constitute a compromise on principle.  It 
means climbing the first rung of a ladder before climbing the
second.  If abortions that cause more pain are greater evils than those that
cause less pain (or no pain), we should outlaw the greater evil if we cannot
outlaw both evils.  Incomplete laws are better than no law at all.

<P>      However, we must not compromise, allowing an incomplete law that
would eliminate or seriously reduce the chances of a complete law later.
We must never say that a little bit of murder is acceptable.  No murder is
acceptable.  We must constantly work towards eliminating all abortions.
      
<P>People who do not understand that a very early abortion is wrong will
usually see the wrongness of a late abortion. There are parallel examples
in which the wrongness of some abortions is easier to see than that of
others.  Thus, if we can convince people that certain abortions should be
prohibited, we should do so; and then continue our efforts to extend this
to all other abortions as well.
      
<P>Keeping in mind, then, the temporary character of these stages, let
me suggest some examples of them.

<P><OL><LI>A law, or court ruling, that allows protection for the child; then
one that requires it.
<LI>A ban on all third trimester abortions, then second then first; or,
a ban on killing a viable child, then a previable child.
<LI> A ban on abortions that cause the worst pain or are more likely
to cause pain; then, a ban on others.
<LI>A ban on all surgical abortions and abortion pills (e.g., RU486);
then, one on abortifacients.
<LI>A denial that there is any right to an abortion. This would mean
prohibiting all abortions other than the hard cases (rape, incest, health
and life of the woman); then, prohibiting these as well.  The first stage
would eliminate about ninety-seven percent of all abortions, a great first
step, but only a first step.
      
<P>These five items refer to eliminating all abortions, stage by stage.  The
remaining nine concern abortions that remain at any stage short of the
final stage.  They are aimed at reducing the harm done to the child, to the
woman, and to the family; at curtailing the number of abortions; and at
lessening the inherent evil of abortion (e.g., by banning government
funding).  There should be no abortions at all, at least no legal abortions,
but as long as it is impossible to ban all legal abortions, those that occur
must include:
      
<P><LI>Anesthesia for the child in all cases where there is even a slight
chance of pain for the child.
<LI>An informed consent requirement.  Any person considering
  a medical procedure has a right to a full disclosure concerning what
  that procedure involves and what its possible consequences are.  It can
  be expected that this requirement will significantly reduce the number
  of abortions.  The full disclosure should include all relevant information about 
the effects of the abortion: (A) What the child looks like, her
  status of development. (B) What abortion does to the child, the methods
  of abortion, the high probability of terrible pain for the child, and the
  length of time of the procedure. (C) What abortion can do to the woman,
  short term and long term, physically, psychologically, and in regard to
  future pregnancies: how it can effect her relationships with others.
  (D) Where applicable, the hazards of eugenic abortions (for eliminating
  handicapped babies), especially amniocentesis.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes_ep.htm#10>10</A></SUP> (E) Alternatives to
  abortion. (F) Support groups ready to help the woman continue a
  difficult pregnancy, especially by supporting her in the face of pressure
  by others to abort.

<P>       It is of the greatest importance that the woman be given this
  information honestly and objectively, that she be encouraged to ask
  questions.  Any kind of pressure in the direction of abortion must be
  prohibited.
       <LI>A forty-eight-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed, 
so that the woman has time to change her mind.  Many do.  It is
  a tragedy when a woman is rushed into an abortion, one she may regret
  bitterly.
<LI>A requirement that in all live births, the child be given complete
  medical treatment to maximize his chances for survival and health.
       <LI>Parental consent for minors, something required for all other
  medical treatments.  Making an exception for abortion is outrageous.
<LI>Spousal consent for married women.  Excluding the father is a
  terrible injustice.  The father has obligations of child support; he should
  also have corresponding rights.  For unmarried women, the right of legal
  intervention for the father of the child.
       <LI>A ban on all government funding of abortion.
<LI>A ban on all other government participation in abortion.  This
  includes a ban on: offering abortions at government facilities such as
  military bases, granting tax exempt status to organizations that promote
  or perform abortions, funding such organizations, promoting abortion in
  government-sponsored programs, such as family planning.
       <LI>Other measures, such as a ban on all advertising for so-called
  abortion services, and excluding abortion from health insurance plans.
</OL>
<P>       As many of these proposals as possible should be enacted 
concurrently, and coordinated with one another.


<P>
<LI>While working towards this objective, we must continue our
   efforts to save babies and their mothers from abortion.  An excellent guide
   to this is Joseph Scheidler's book, <EM>Closed: 99 Ways to Stop 
Abortion</EM>.  His
   first way is sidewalk counseling, in which pro-lifers go to abortion clinics
   "to intercede for the baby's life":

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Sidewalk counseling is a method of saving babies by talking to their
         parents in front of the abortion clinic.  It is probably the single most
         valuable activity that a pro-life person can engage in.  When pro-lifers
         counsel in front of an abortion clinic, they are coming between the
         woman and the doctor, between the baby who is scheduled to be killed
         and the doctor who will do the killing.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes_ep.htm#11>11</A></SUP>
</FONT>
<P>
         These efforts can be highly successful:

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>
         Women can be turned back.  In Chicago, in one thirty day period, half
         a dozen sidewalk counselors at only a few clinics were able to stop
         ninety women from having abortions.  Seventeen were stopped in a
         single morning at a clinic on Michigan Avenue.  While a few of these
         women may have gone back to have their abortions later, more than
         ninety percent did not return and they kept in touch with the pro-life
         counseling center.<SUP><A HREF=notes_ep.htm#12>12</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
         As the title indicates, there are many things one can do to fight the
   evil of abortion.  A sample of these include: The Counter-Demonstration,
   How to Get on Talk Shows, Aids to Effective Lobbying, Call their Bluff: the
   Legal Threat, and Warn the Garbage Man, "You're Hauling Corpses." All
   of these ways are non-violent, and there is a chapter, "Violence: Why It
   Won't Work."<SUP><A HREF=notes_ep.htm#13>13</A></SUP>
       
<P>  Besides Scheidler's suggestions, especially direct intervention on
   the sidewalk, there are several other specific things we should do:
       
<P>  We should support women with problem pregnancies.  We should
   encourage them to keep their babies.  If they are being pressured by others
   to kill their babies, we should offer them a haven of support and
   encouragement.  In all these things there should be both spiritual and
   material assistance.
       
<P>  We should work to encourage adoption as an alternative to abortion
   for cases where the woman is unable to raise the child.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes_ep.htm#14>14</A></SUP>
       
<P>  We should be concerned with women who have had abortions.

       
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
  If you or someone you love is suffering from the emotional or physical
         aftereffects Of abortion, you can find compassionate help and support
         from women who have been through the same experience by contacting 
any of the WEBA chapters in your state, or any of the other post-abortion 
counseling groups which are being formed.  If WEBA is not
          listed in your phone directory, call one of your local or state right-to-life 
organizations and they will be able to give you a phone number for
          the post-abortion support group nearest you.  Most of these groups
          have a hot-line that you can call to talk to a sympathetic, non-judgmental 
member at any time, whenever you need them.<SUP><A 
HREF=notes_ep.htm#15>15</A></SUP>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
          There is also a nationwide toll-free crisis hot line: 1-800-848-5683.
       
<P>   Abortion can be devastating to women, in many ways, as we have
   seen.  We should continue our research into this: How many women
   suffer?  From which problems?  For how long?  How severely?  We should
   carefully examine the challenges of abortion defenders.  Our aim must
   always be to find the truth.
       
<P>   We must warn women of the hazards of abortion.  I see this as a task
   of the greatest importance.  We must protect not only the child, but also
   the mother.  This protection can come from the law, and from an
   awakened public that realizes the evil of abortion and condemns it.  It can
   also come from an awareness of the terrible things abortion can do to
   women. The myth of "safe abortions" must be exposed for what it is.  We
   must work towards a general awareness of the threat of abortion to
   women.  "Having an abortion can be hazardous to your health" must
   become a household phrase.
       
<P>   Saving babies, supporting women before their decision and after it,
   these are our present tasks.  Many organizations exist for these purposes;
   let us join them, or start new ones where there are none.  We cannot merely
   be against abortion; we must be for the woman and her child, and we
   should translate this commitment into action.  In fact, we are 
<EM>against</EM>
   abortion only because we are <EM>for</EM> the child and his 
mother.<SUP><A HREF=notes_ep.htm#16>16</A></SUP>
       
<P><LI>Through all this, we must see ourselves as advocates of the
   preborn child: voices for those who cannot speak for themselves, who are
   forgotten because they are unseen.  Equally, we must be advocates of
   women, supporting and encouraging them.  For both the child and the
   woman, we must promote adoption as an alternative to abortion.

<P>          These commitments must continue after we achieve our objective of
   fully recognized personhood for the child.  That will be a major step, but
   it will not be the end of the road.  The temptation to succumb to abortion
   will remain after it has been made illegal.  The struggle for justice is an
   ongoing one.
       
</OL>

<P>   Finally, I would like to suggest that we work to heal the wounds in
   our society resulting from the bitter struggle over abortion. If we affirm the
   personhood of the preborn child and the woman, we must also affirm the
   personhood of all those who advocate abortion.  We must try to help them
   see abortion in a new way.

For the sake of argument, let's assume our lifeboat is ... the USS
Nimitz.<p>
<img src="nimitz.gif"><p>

The Nimitz is one of our nation's largest aircraft carriers. It's
flight deck is 1088 feet long and 252 feet wide.
(It's not a perfect rectangle, so simply multiplying
this length and width gives an area somewhat bigger than the true size.)
It's actual crew is 5700, but if it had the same population density that the
earth has in real life, how many people would be on it? Give it your best guess
before you go to the next page.<p>

If the USS Nimitz had the same population density that the earth as a whole
has, the number of people on board would be ... less than one.<p>

That's right, less than one. The earth has about
seven acres of land per person (that's just land -- not water, and not
counting Antarctica). The Nimitz' deck is
less than six acres.<p>

One person on an entire aircraft carrier is the desperate overcrowding that so
concerns the population control activists. And their solution to this
overcrowding problem? Why, to start throwing people overboard, of course.
Starting with the unborn, through abortion. An easy prediction to make is that
their next proposal will be to get rid of some of the "useless" elderly or
seriously ill through euthanasia.<p>

<h1>Sex Education and Teen Sex</h1>

<hr>
Return to <a href="tangents.htm">Tangents</a> |
<a href="../index.html">Ohio Right to Life Home</a><p>

<hr>
Sex education has become a standard part of the curriculum of schools
throughout America. The goal is to teach
teenagers to practice "safe sex" -- that is, to use condoms or other birth
control devices -- and so reduces the chance that they will become pregnant or
become infected with a venereal disease.<p>

Occassionally supporters of sex education will argue that such programs reduce
teen sexual activity. But more often they
strongly oppose the idea of suggesting that teens should abstain
from sex outside marriage, as this would violate the "separation of church and
state". Besides, they explain, teens are going to have sex regardless of what
their parents or teachers tell them, so the only practical thing to do is to
try to reduce the damage when they <i>do</i> have sex.<p>

Does sex education result in more or less teen sexual
activity? Even if it does not
reduce the total activity, does it at least result in teens practicing more
"safe sex"?<p>

Planned Parenthood conducted a landmark study of this subject back in 1986.
Planned Parenthood is, of course, one of the leading advocates of more and
earlier and more explicit sex education, and so if their study
is at all biased, it would surely be on the side of the benefits of sex
education.<p>

In reporting the results of their study, they pointed out that teens who had
gone through what Planned Parenthood considered a "comprehensive" sex education
program were significantly more likely to use birth control.
Thus, they trumpeted, comprehensive sex education is a resounding success.<p>

By the way: They
defined "comprehensive" sex education as a program that included at least
four of six categories: biology of reproduction, coping with sexual
development, different types of birth control, preventing sexual abuse,
abortion, and where to get contraceptives. As three of the six are abortion and
birth control (note its mentioned twice), for a program to be labeled
"comprehensive" it had to discuss birth control and/or abortion.<p>

Assuming that the numbers they report in the "back of the book" are accurate,
it is true that sex education <i>does</i> result in
greater use of birth control. But a close examination of the numbers reveals
that this does not mean what Planned Parenthood would like you to think it
means.<p>

Planned Parenthood reported the results of their study as follows:<p>
<pre>
Chart 1
                                           | Sex WITH       Sex WITHOUT
                           Had sex  No sex | birth control  birth control
                           -------  ------ + -------------  -------------
Total number of teens      350      600    |   160            168
                                           |
Comprehensive sex ed        46%      31%   |    53%            40%
Non-comprehensive sex ed    19%      26%   |    18%            22%
No sex ed                   34%      42%   |    28%            37%
</pre>

This is an odd way to present the statistics, as it does not allow us to
readily compare the sexual behavior of students who did and did not go
through "comprehensive sex education". However, there is sufficient information
here to
allow us to compute the percentages in a different way. (For the mathematically
inclined or those who question the accuracy of the following chart, I explain
how I came up with this chart at the end of this article.)<p>

<pre>
Chart 2
                             Comp    Non-Comp  No
                             sex ed  sex ed    sex ed
                             ------  --------  ------
No sex                        54%      70%       68%
Had sex                       46%      30%       32%

Sex WITHOUT birth control     19%      17%       17%
Sex WITH birth control        24%      13%       12%
Sex, birth control unknown     3%       0%        3%
</pre>
Note that the bottom section shows the percentage of the TOTAL teens who had
sex and used birth control, not just the percentage of those who had sex.<p>

Studying the data in this form reveals a couple of interesting facts:<p>
<ul>
<li>Teens who went through what Planned Parenthood considered "comprehensive
sex education" -- i.e. a "good" program" -- were over 50% more likely to be
sexually active. (From 30% to 46%.)
<li>These teens were almost twice as
likely to engage in "safe sex" (from 13% to 24%). This agrees with Planned
Parenthood's boasts.
<li>But ... they were still slightly MORE likely to engage in "unsafe sex" (17%
versus 19%).
</ul>
In other words: Yes, Planned Parenthood - style sex education teaches teens to
practice "safe sex". But what they give up is not "unsafe sex", it's sexual
abstinence. And so we end up with the worst of both worlds: more immorality AND
more teen pregnancy and venereal disease.<p>

Of course, Planned Parenthood gets government grants to hand out contraceptives
to teenagers. And, as the above study indicates, sex education is bringing them
a lot of business.<p>

<hr>
<font size=-1>
Chart 2 was derived from Chart 1 as follows:<p>

Note that they provided the actual number for each column of percentages. We
can thus compute the number of teens represented by each percentage by
multiplying the percentage by the number at the top of the column. This gives
the following chart:<p>

<pre>

The federal government spends millions of dollars on family planning programs
which are intended to reduce teen sexual activity and pregnancy. How effective
are these programs?<p>

A cynic might point out that while spending on Title X (the umbrella that
includes most of these programs) has now grown to
almost $200 million per year, teen pregnancy continues to rise. Have they
accomplished anything at all?<p>

We might get a glimpse of their effectiveness by looking at what happened in
the early 1980's. There was a dispute between the administration and Congress
over how Title X money should be spent, and they ended up actually reducing
appropriations (rare for a government program). As federal family planning
activities had to be cut back, what happened to teen pregnancy rates? (Note:
the following chart lists out-of-wedlock births and abortions rather than total
pregnancies, because that's the data actually available.)<p>

Hmm, that's funny. When federal spending on family planning went up,
teen pregnancy went up. When federal spending on family planning went down,
teen pregnancy went down. In fact, the two trend lines practically parallel
each other.<p>

Maybe the cynic would be right after all.<p>

<p align=center>
by Jay Johansen<p>

We recently received a communication challenging the validity of a
reference to an article in a medical journal in our "Abortion: Complications"
article. As we try to be meticulously accurate, I investigated the matter.<p>

Let's start at the beginning. The statement in the original article was:
"<i>Obstetrics and Gynecology</i> (May, 1985) admitted that today's
abortion-related deaths may be under-reported by as much as 50 percent."<p>

The objection we received was as follows (this is the complete text):<p>

<blockquote>
Your obgyn 1985 cite is wrong.  The article says, and I quote, "Intensive
surveillance of maternal mortality in two states
has demonstrated that maternal deaths may be underreported
by 45 to 50%."  Two articles are cited:  the title of
one is "The Risk of Childbearing Re-evaluated",
which tells even people who don't bother to read it
that it's addressing all maternal deaths, not just
those related to abortion.  The ObGyn article calls
for changing all maternal deaths to be tracked in
the same way in which abortion-related maternal
deaths are tracked.

I'll check your site in a few days to see if a correction has been made.
</blockquote>

So I read the OB-GYN article. It turns out that this article does not present
any new evidence on this subject,
it simply quotes two articles that had appeared previously
in other journals.<p>

The first of these is "The Risk of Childbearing Re-Evaluated", in the
<i>American Journal of Public Health,</i>, 1981, 71:712-716. As the objection
indicates, this article deals, not just with deaths from abortion, but with
all maternal deaths. Indeed, the bulk of the article deals with deaths related
to live birth. Nevertheless, they do mention abortion-related deaths:
"Intensive nationwide surveillance of abortion-related deaths ... showed that
only 52 percent of abortion-related deaths were so reported by state vital
records ..."<p>

<b>Conclusion:</b> The author of the original article was sloppy in giving this
secondhand reference rather than referring back to the original article. In
this case this was a particularly poor decision, as
the text in the quoted article was ambiguous. But when we do go back and read
the original article, it confirms what the author said. So while we may
criticize his scholarly writing style, his facts are correct.<p>

<h2>Outline</h2>

The Brain Suction abortion is a relatively new and particularly grisly method
of performing 2nd &amp; 3rd trimester abortions. It involves removing most of
the unborn child's lower body from the uterus while still alive, punching a
hole in the child's skull and inserting a suction catheter to suck out the
child's brain.<p>

A September 1992 presentation to a National Abortion Federation seminar
indicated that the brain suction procedure was used on patient's 20-26 weeks in
pregnancy and that the author, an Ohio abortionist, had performed it over 700
times as of that date.<p>

The bill prohibits the use of the brain suction abortion method. Violation
of the Act would be a fourth degree felony and subject the violator to civil
liability and professional discipline.<p>

Because of constitutional concerns, the bill contains an affirmative defense
permitting use of the procedure if it was established that all other methods of
abortion would pose greater risks to the health of the pregnant woman.<p>

The bill contains a purpose clause indicating that it was based on furthering
the legitimate state interest of avoiding unnecessary cruelty to the human
fetus, just as the state would have a legitimate state interest in avoiding
unnecessary cruelty to animals.<p>

<h2>The Procedure</h2>

We had some qualms about posting a
<a href="../aborters/dx.htm">real description</a>
of this procedure. But when I mentioned at a board meeting that this might be
too ugly to publish,
<a href="../tangents/jancar.htm">Jan</a>,
our chief lobbyist, who has been trying to get
this kind of information published, commented,
"Censored by newspapers across the state, and now by
Ohio Right to Life". So okay, I've put it on.<p>

<h2>Legislative History</h2>

The final bill represents a compromise
after intense negotiations between pro-abortion Republicans and the bill's
sponsor, a pro-life Democrat. (Now that's a switch ...)<p>

These negotiations were nothing short of bizarre. The pro-aborts objected to
the bill's use of the term "unborn child". We expected them to insist on some
dehumanizing term, like "fetal tissue" or "product of conception". But the term
they insisted be used was ... "unborn human".<p>

Even more amazingly, the pro-aborts objected to an effort to single out one
particular abortion procedure. So they proposed a compromise: outlaw all
post-viability abortions! The pro-life Republicans grudgingly agreed to this
for the sake of party unity ...<p>

The pro-lifers did have to make some real concessions. The descriptive term
"brain suction" was replaced with the more clinical "D&amp;X", the term used by
the abortionist who invented this procedure. There was also a technical but
important concession on standards of evidence: The original bill had said that
an abortionist could use this procedure if he could prove in court that it was
the safest procedure for the mother; the compromise bill requires the
prosecutor to prove that it is <strong>not</strong> the safest.<p>

<h2>Response from the National Abortion Federation</h2>

In the interests of free speech and equal time, we include a response from
the other side. The
following is the text of a letter from the National Abortion Federation
to its members regarding the publicity over this procedure. (Note: This letter
was typed in by hand. We apologize if there are any typos.)<p>

<blockquote>
June 18, 1993<p>
Dear NAF Member:<p>

Many of you have called in recent weeks regarding distribution of an
inflammatory anti-abortion flyer depicting graphic details of the Dilation and
Extraction (D&amp;X) abortion procedure. We would like to provide you with some
accurate information on this procedure, as well as some guidelines in
discussing this and any other abortion procedure with the press and public.<p>

First of all, the D&amp;X procedure was presented as part of the NAF "Second
Trimester Abortion: From Every Angle" risk management seminar held in September
of 1992. The surgical method described differs from a classic Dilation and
Evacuation (D&amp;E) procedure only in that it does not rely upon dismemberment
to remove the fetus. Rather, the surgeon grasps and removes a nearly intact
fetus through an adequately dilated cervix. This is a small variation in a
basic surgical procedure that has been performed for over 15 years. The
workbooks and tapes from this meeting are available to all NAF members who
would like additional details.<p>

The language and graphics used in the latest anti-choice propaganda to describe
this procedure are disturbing to some readers. Much of the negative reaction,
however, is the same reaction that might be invoked if one were to listen to a
surgeon describing step-by-step almost any other surgical procedure involving
blood, human tissue, etc.<p>

Here are a few talking points that may help you in discussing this
procedure:<p>

1. Don't apologize: this is a legal abortion procedure.<p>

2. The woman receiving the abortion is the patient.<p>

3. The obligation of any physician is to ensure that the abortion procedure
selected best promotes the health and safety of his/her patient.<p>

4. There is <i>no</i> method of abortion that is acceptable to an anti-choice
person.<p>

5. This is not a common procedure. Very few woman have abortions after 20
weeks; one-half of one-percent of all abortions are performed after 20 weeks;
some 300-500 abortions a year are performed after 24 weeks of pregnancy.<p>

6. There are many reasons why women have late abortions: life endangerment,
fetal indications, lack of money or health insurance, social-psychological
crises, lack of knowledge about human reproduction, etc. Use the NAF fact sheet
on second trimester abortion.<p>

7. Women who are having an abortion because of fetal anomalies are able to have
the intact fetus examined by geneticists, thereby providing a better diagnostic
evaluation of the chances for a future healthy pregnancy.<p>

8. Abortions in cases of fetal defect are almost always performed after 20
weeks. The availability of testing for severe fetal defects, such as Tay-Sachs,
has actually permitted women who otherwise would not risk becoming pregnant to
conceive and bear a child. Any prohibitions on abortions after 20 weeks would
prohibit women from having abortions in cases of severe fetal defects.<p>

It is critically important that NAF members be able to share information on new
and improved abortion technologies in the spirit of scientific advancement, as
with any other medical advances. While we face political pressures unknown in
other segments of health care that often discourage open dialogue, NAF will
continue to provide the latest in advances in abortion care to improve women's
health.<p>

We take pride in keeping you up-to-date on medical issues in abortion care and
are pleased to contribute to the health of your clients. If we can answer any
other questions about the above, please feel free to contact us.<p>

<h1><img src="../people/clinton.gif" align=left>
Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act:<br>
President's Veto</h1><br clear=all>

<a href="../index.html">Ohio Right to Life Home</a><br>
<hr>

I am returning herewith without any approval H.R. 1833, which would prohibit
doctors from performing a certain kind of abortion. I do so because the bill
does not allow women to protect themselves from serious threats to their
health. By refusing to permit women, in reliance on their doctors' best medical
judgment, to use their [sic] procedure when their lives are threatened or when
their health is put in serious jeopardy, the Congress has fashioned a bill that
is consistent neither with the Constitution nor with sound public policy.<p>

I have always believed that the decision to have an abortion generally should
be between a woman, her doctor, her conscience, and her God. I support the
decision in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> protecting a woman's right to choose, and I
believe that the abortions  protected by that decision should be safe and rare.
Consistent with that decision, I have long opposed late-term abortions
except where necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. In fact, as
Governor of Arkansas, I signed into law a bill that barred third trimester
abortions, with an appropriate exception for life or health.<p>

The procedure described in H.R. 1833 has troubled me deeply, as it has many
people. I cannot support use of that procedure on an elective basis, where the
abortion is being performed for non-health related reasons and there are
equally safe medical procedures available.<p>

There are, however, rare and tragic situations that can occur in a woman's
pregnancy in which, in a doctor's medical judgment, the use of this procedure
may be necessary to save a woman's life or to protect her against serious
injury to her health. In these situations, in which a woman and her family must
make an awful choice, the Constitution requires, as it should, that the ability
to choose this procedure be protected.<p>

In the past several months, I have heard from women who desperately wanted to
have their babies, who were devastated to learn that their babies had fatal
conditions and would not live, who wanted anything other than an
abortion, but who were advised by their doctors that this procedure was their
best chance to avert the risk of death or grave harm which, in some cases,
would have included an inability to ever bear children again. For these women,
this was not about choice--not about deciding against having a child. These
babies were certain to perish before, during or shortly after birth, and the
only question was how much grave damage was going to be done to the woman.<p>

I cannot sign H.R. 1833, as passed, because it fails to protect women in such
dire circumstances -- because by treating doctors who perform the procedure in
these tragic cases as criminals, the bill poses a danger of serious harm to
women. This bill, in curtailing the ability of women and their doctors to
choose the procedure for sound medical reasons, violates the constitutional
command that any law regulating abortion protect both the life and the
health of the woman. The bill's overbroad criminal prohibition risks that women
will suffer serious injury.<p>

That is why I implored Congress to add an exemption for the small number of
compelling cases where selection of the procedure, in the medical judgment of
the attending physician, was necessary to preserve the life of the woman or
avert serious adverse consequences to her health. The life exception in the
current bill only covers cases where the doctor believes that the woman will
die. It fails to cover cases where, absent the procedure, serious physical
harm, often including losing the ability to have more children, is very likely
to occur. I told Congress that I would sign H.R. 1833 if it were amended to add
an exception for serious health consequences. A bill amended in this way would
strike a proper balance, remedying the constitutional and human defect of H.R.
1833. If such a bill were presented to me, I would sign it now.<p>

I understand the desire to eliminate the use of a procedure that appears
inhumane. But to eliminate it without taking into consideration the rare and
tragic circumstances in which its use may be necessary would be even more
inhumane.<p>

The Congress chose not to adopt the sensible and constitutionally
appropriate proposal I made, instead leaving women unprotected against serious
health risks. As a result of this Congressional indifference to women's health,
I cannot, in good conscience and consistent with my responsibility to uphold
the law, sign this legislation.<p>

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1462.html">Title 18,
&#167; 1462</a>
of the United States Code, passed in 1897, forbids
the shipment of certain abortion-related items
by common carriers (that is, shipping companies, like
<a href="http://www.fedex.com">FedEx</a> or
<a href="http://www.ups.com">UPS</a>).
Specifically, it forbids the shipment of drugs or
devices used to commit abortions, or of advertisements or other information
describing where to get an abortion.
(It also forbids such shipment of obscene material.) This
law has not been enforced since the early 1900's.<p>

&#167; 507 of the
<a href="ftp://ftp.loc.gov/pub/thomas/c104/s652.enr.FTP">Telecommunications Act
of 1996</a> amends this law to make it also apply to the Internet. The relevant
section of the bill and the law as it would be amended is given
<a href="#sec507">below.</a><p>

There have been numerous news reports saying that this law would forbid people
from talking about abortion on the Internet, and many have therefore denounced
it as a violation of freedom of speech. A number of people have asked us
whether this Web site would be shut down because of this law.<p>

A simple reading of the law shows that these statements are exagerrated.
Presumably the section of the law that forbids shipping abortion-related drugs
or devices would not apply to the Internet, at least until someone figures out
how to transmit such objects through a modem. The remaining section clearly
says that it is banning abortion <i>advertising</i>, not discussion. There is
no restriction in this law on debating the morality and politics of
abortion. While it is conceivable that a judge could "interpret" the
language of this law to prohibit pro-life speech, one could make such
speculations about any law.<p>

It might be argued that, as abortion is legal, a restriction on advertising it
on a particular medium like this
is a violation of free speech. But then by the same reasoning, the prohibition
against advertising cigarettes on television would also be unconstitutional, as
would many other legal restrictions on advertising.
But given our courts' zealous regard for abortion as the premier
constitutional right, overriding even those which are actually mentioned in the
Constitution, it would not be surprising if this bill was declared
unconstitutional.<p>

<hr>

<i>The following information has been supplied to us by a pro-life group from
South Africa:</i><p>

<blockquote>
A committee was set up to make recommendations on South African abortion law.
The key points from their report:<p>

Below are the recommendations of the ad hoc committee on abortion 
(appointed by the government) having voted on their report on 29 June 
1995:<p>

1)  The Committee recommends that the current Act be repealed.<p>

2)  The main thrust of the changes introduced by the envisaged new 
Act should be as follows:<p>

a) The Act should provide for abortion, on request of the woman, up 
to 14 weeks gestational age, and between 14 and 24 weeks under 
certain broadly specified conditions.<p>

b) The current cumbersome, time-consuming and discriminatory 
procedures should be simplified.  The requirement that two doctors 
should be consulted, should be removed.  A wider range of health 
personnel should be trained and authorised to perform abortions, 
additional health facilities should be improved in order to increase 
access to women in areas where there are fewer doctors, if any.<p>

c) Counselling should be available to all women requesting abortion, 
but it should be non directive.  It should be non-mandatory, except 
in the case of minors.<p>

d) The consent of the woman's partner or husband should not be 
mandatory.  In the case of a minor she should be advised to consult 
parents or responsible family members or friends, but abortion should 
not be denied if she does not choose to consult.<p>

e) Statistics should be collected by a central authority.  The name 
and identity of the woman should not be passed on to the central 
statistics collection point.<p>

f) Any doctor or other health worker who has conscientious objections 
to taking part in the abortion procedure, should be free torecuse 
himself or herself.  They must, however, refer the woman to others 
who are willing to take part in such procedure.<p>

g) The issues of abortion and sterilisation should be clearly 
separated and should therefore not be dealt with in the same Act.<p>

The committee recommends accordingly.<p>

S A Nkomo<br>
Chairperson<p>

Committee Rooms<br>
Parliament<br>
29 June 1995<p>
</blockquote>

This recommendation was then taken to Parliament for a further 
recommendation for legislation.  Parliament voted 208 to 101 on 30 
August 1995 that the report be adopted.  The report was then referred 
back to the Department of Health (Minister of Health: Dr. (Mrs.) N 
Zuma) where the department's legal advisor compiled a Draft Bill.<p>

This draft Bill is scheduled to be released for public comment and 
submissions on 29 February 1996, and to be taken to Parliament for a vote in
June. However, opponents fear that it may never be publicly released
before the vote.<p>

Planned Parenthood is heavily involved in the public relations campaign
surrounding this bill. Radio and TV regularly air "health" programs featuring a
Planned Parenthood representative
lamenting a woman's "inability to choose".<p>

I wish to express my grateful appreciation to my many friends who encouraged me in the
writing of this book: Ronda Chervin, Alice von Hildebrand, Peter Kreeft, Balduin Schwarz 
(my father).  Wolfgang Waldstein, and Fritz Wenisch.  Two of my friends deserve very
special thanks.  They not only encouraged me but also read the manuscript and made very
helpful suggestions.  They are Kiki Latimer and Ron Tacelli.  Roy Heyne, M.D. provided 
valuable help with the medical and scientific aspects in several chapters, and also
made helpful suggestions for strengthening the argument.

<P> To all those who typed portions of the manuscript, my heartfelt thanks: Ede Williams,
Mary Lee Harrington, Terri Russo, my wife Sherry, and my three daughters, Elizabeth, Margaret
and Mary.

<P>  A special expression of gratitude is due to the late Dietrich von Hildebrand, whom I was
privileged to have as a friend and teacher from my earliest youth until his death in 1977.
It is mainly from him that I learned the art of philosophizing as careful analysis of
and faithfulness to reality.  His inspiration guided me throughout this work.
<P>

<OL>
<P><LI><A NAME=1>      Only </A>the basic organs are present; they are not 
yet 
developed as they
      will be in the future.  I am indebted to Dr. Roy Heyne for his many
      helpful suggestions on medical and scientific matters in this chapter
      and chapters 2, 3, and 6.

  <P><LI><A NAME=2></A><A HREF=wcited.htm#amicus_curiae>Amicus 
Curiae</A>, pp.  8-25.  See <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Heffernan>Heffernan</A> (1972) for a similar, partly
      equivalent statement.  Other descriptions of the developing child in
      the womb include <A HREF=wcited.htm#Blechschmidt>Blechschmidt</A> 
(1961),(1977).(1981); <A HREF=wcited.htm#Moore>Moore</A> (1988);
      <A HREF=wcited.htm#Patten>Patten</A> (1968); <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Shettles_Rugh>Shettles and Rugh</A> (1971); <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Flanagan>Flanagan</A> (1965); <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Nathanson>Nathanson</A> (1979), pp. 197-205, esp., 
202-203, <A HREF=wcited.htm#Willke>Willke</A> (1979), pp. 5-27,
      (1985), pp. 5-6, 33-35; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Young>Young</A> (1983), pp. 
74-80; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Bergel>Bergel</A> (1985), pp.  I-2 to I-13; <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Drama><EM>Drama of Life Before Birth</EM></A>. See also 
Albert W. <A HREF=wcited.htm#Liley>Liley</A>, "The
      Foetus in Control of his Environment" (1972) which shows the fetus
      as an active dynamic being; and "A Day in the Life of a Fetus" (1981).

<P>      (In the quotation from <A HREF=wcited.htm#Amicus_Curiae>Amicus 
Curiae</A>, and in all subsequent quotations containing footnotes, these 
references have been omitted.)

 <P><LI><A NAME=3></A>   Particularly fascinating is the fact that in a baby 
girl, "by the day
      46 ... the 600,000 potential ova of a lifetime already exist in" her.  She
      is just starting her own life, and is already being prepared for eventual
      (possible) motherhood! <A HREF=wcited.htm#Nathanson>Nathanson</A> 
(1979), p. 202.

 <P><LI><A NAME=4></A> <EM><A HREF=wcited.htm#Amicus_Curiae>Amicus 
Curiae</A></EM>, p. 21.

 <P><LI><A NAME=5></A>   <A HREF=wcited.htm#Nathanson>Nathanson</A> 
(1983), p. 150. He also discusses fetal surgery which is
      already occurring and soon will be commonplace.  The child in the
      womb is treated as a patient, a distinct being in his own right, with
      his own ailments. p. 143, passirn.  See also <EM><A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Amicus_Curiae>Amicus Curiae</A></EM>, "The
      Doctor Treats the Unborn Just as He Does Any Patient." (pp. 26-32).

 <P><LI><A NAME=6></A>   More precisely, "I who now <EM>validly</EM> 
remember. . . " Invalid memory
      experiences, in which I seem to remember having an experience that
      I actually never had, are an exception to the general rule, that we now
      have a memory experience of something because we really did experience it 
in the past.  The existence of some invalid memory experiences does not 
destroy the usefulness of the general rule for bringing
      out the meaning of personal identity, since (a) the vast majority of
      cases, valid memory, fit directly under it: and (b) even the invalid
      cases fit in terms of what is meant by the memory claim.  That is, when
      I say "I remember . . . " what I mean is that I, the         same person, had
      a certain experience in the past.  The meaning of personal identity
      implied in this memory claim remains intact even if, in a particular
      case, what I seem to remember didn't actually happen.

 <P><LI><A NAME=7></A>   The idea that a human "embryo" or "fetus" is not a 
child but merely
      something that develops into a child is widespread among abortion
      advocates.  See, for example, <A HREF=wcited.htm#Hardin>Hardin</A> 
(1974): "The question ... is whether
      an embryo ... should be given the right to live and develop into a
      child, . . ." (p. 17; see also p. 75).  Also <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Lader>Lader</A> (1966), " . . . whether or
      not a fetus shall become a child affects the population charts." (p. 2).

<P><LI><A NAME=8></A>    Donald <A HREF=wcited.htm#Van>Van De 
Veer's</A> article (1984) is typical of this misunderstanding of the Continuum 
Argument.  He assumes (A) that the anti-abortion position is based on the idea 
that one "can't find a clear cut-off point": and (B) that pointing out the fallacy of 
insisting on such
      "clear cut-off points" is sufficient to discredit the anti-abortion
      position.  "The Conservative [anti-abortion person] is restrictive; he
      permits attention only to consecutive stages." (p. 69).  Van De Veer is
      mistaken on both points,  A and B.

<P><LI><A NAME=9></A>    <A HREF=wcited.htm#Nathanson>Nathanson</A> 
affirms the continuum of human life when he says: "It is
      a continuous spectrum that begins in utero and ends at death - the
      bans of the spectrum are designated by words such as fetus, infant,
      child, adolescent, and adult." <EM>New England Journal of Medicine</EM>,
      "Sounding Board" Section, Nov. 28, 1974.  Reprinted in his <EM>Aborting
      America</EM> (1979), p. 165.  Also, (1983), p. 137.



   <P><LI><A NAME=10></A> See <A HREF=wcited.htm#Grisez>Grisez</A>, 
"Abortion and Prejudice against the Unborn" (1972), pp.
       467-70 (epilogue of his book).  He lists six aspects of prejudice, each
       of them applicable to the attitude of defenders of abortion toward the
       prebom, victims of the prejudice.  For example, taking advantage of
       a difference between oneself, or one's own group, and the class of
       victims of prejudice.

   <P><LI><A NAME=1 ></A> <EM>Life or Death.</EM> Brochure depicting the 
results of abortion (Hiltz Pub.
       Co.: Cincinnati, 1972).  Description under picture and caption, "D &
       C abortion at 12 weeks." Essentially the same description appears in
       the 1981 edition, which also describes D & E abortions.

       Data for weeks 9 and 10 are also from <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Flanagan>Flanagan</A> (1965). pp. 80-81.
       Data for week 4.5 is from a brochure, <EM>Life?  When did your life 
begin?</EM>
       (Value of Life Committee, Inc.: Brighton, MA).  Data assembled by
       physician members of this committee, using a number of standard
       scientific texts, including <A HREF=wcited.htm#Shettles_Rugh>Shettles 
and Rugh</A> (1971).  Some Items
       appear in more than one place.

 
 <P><LI><A NAME=11></A> The moral equivalence of abortion and infanticide 
applies also in the
      reverse direction: if abortion is accepted, infanticide follows (logically
      and historically).  See: <A HREF=wcited.htm#Brennan>Brennan</A> (1983), 
pp. 81`-90; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Delahoyde>Delahoyde</A> (1984);
      <A HREF=wcited.htm#Manney_Blattner>Manney and Blattner</A> (1984), 
pp. 11 5-29. ("If you could kill someone
      five days before he was born, why not five days after?") <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Quay>Quay</A>, (1980);
      <A HREF=wcited.htm#Willke>Willke</A> (1985), pp. 203-215 ("Abortion 
Leads to Infanticide like Night
      Follows Day.. . Same Patient / Same problem / Same Solution.")
      <A HREF=wcited.htm#Willke>Willke</A> (1979), pp. 
111-23. Among those who defend abortion, Fletcher
      says, "It is reasonable, indeed, to describe infanticide as post-natal
      abortion."Quoted in <A HREF=wcited.htm#Brennan>Brennan</A> (1983), p. 
82.  A similar position is that
      of <A HREF=wcited.htm#Tooley>Tooley</A>: "In Defense of Abortion and 
Infanticide" (1984); I will
      carefully examine this position in chapter 7.

 <P><LI><A NAME=12></A> <A HREF=wcited.htm#Williamson>Williamson</A> 
(1978), p. 62

 <P><LI><A NAME=13></A>  It is sometimes thought that an evil motive is 
essential for murder.
      Thus, <A HREF=wcited.htm#Bajema>Bajema</A> (1974) lists "Four 
lngredients of Murder." They are: "(1) A person is killed. (2) He is killed 
intentionally. (3) The person killed is innocent. (4) There is unlawful or sinful 
motive involved in the killing." That (4) is not essential will become clear in what 
follows.  See also note 14.

 <P><LI><A NAME=14></A>  For a similar analysis, including a similar example, 
see <A HREF=wcited.htm#Devine>Devine</A>
      (1978). p. 15.  It should also be noted that Bajema's "sinful motive"
      (see note 13) refers to what is true of persons rather than of actions
      in themselves, and is therefore out of place here, where the question
      is whether abortion as an action is murder.  Bajema holds that
      abortion is murder, except for what he calls "critical abortion,"
      abortion to save the life of the woman (pp. 47-48).

 <P><LI><A NAME=15></A>  Or similar phrases. See, e.g., <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Reardon>Reardon</A> (1987), pp. xvii, 184, 280, and
      304.

 <P><LI><A NAME=16></A>  <EM>lbid</EM>. pp. 181, 277, 304, 309.

 <P><LI><A NAME=17></A>  He will "never know the difference" as far as this 
<EM>life</EM> is concerned; and
      if death is annihilation, he will simply "never know the difference," as
      he will simply "not be." But if there is a life after death, he may even
      come to realize that he was killed and thereby deprived of what would
      have been the rest of his life.  It will then not be true that if he is killed
      "in his sleep," he will "never know the difference." This point applies
      equally to a born person killed in his sleep and to a pre-born child
          killed in the womb. or, perhaps it applies with greater devastation to
          the pre-born child: he would realize that he was deprived of his entire
          life after birth! This is one more reason for not making the assump-
          tion that "he will never know the difference."

      <P><LI><A NAME=28></A> Besides deliberately killing the child by active 
means and letting her
          die through neglect, there is also deliberately doing nothing so that
          she dies, intentionally letting her die.  Morally, this is like the first,
          behaviorly, it resembles the second.

 <P><LI><A NAME=1></A>Proposals and defenses of birth as the critical point 
include Cisler in
    "Unfinished Business: Birth Control and Women's Liberation," in
    Robin Morgan (ed.), <EM>Sisterhood is Powerful</EM> (New York: Random
    House, 1970). p. 274.  Quoted in <A HREF=wcited.htm#Sumner>Sumner</A> 
(198 1), p. 51: <A HREF=wcited.htm#Hardin>Hardin</A> (1974)
    p. 100; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Lader>Lader</A> (1966), p. 168; and <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Lomansky>Lomansky</A> (1 982), p. 172.  Rejections
    and refutations include <A HREF=wcited.htm#Devine>Devine</A> (1978), pp. 
87-88; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Glover>Glover</A> (1977),
         pp. 125-26 and 159, last lines; <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Nathanson>Nathanson</A> (1979), pp. 210-11 (see
         below, p. 44); <A HREF=wcited.htm#Singer>Singer</A> (1979a) p. 108; 
<A HREF=wcited.htm#Sumner>Sumner</A> (1981), pp. 52-53;
         <A HREF=wcited.htm#Tooley>Tooley</A> (1973), pp. 74-75; and <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Werner>Werner</A> (1979) p. 55.  The last four (as
         well as Glover) all defend abortion: Sumner and Werner "draw the
         line" at sentience, Singer and Tooley after birth.

    <P><LI><A NAME=2></A> <A HREF=wcited.htm#Nathanson>Nathanson</A> 
(1983), p. 132.  He states:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
          [In] fetoscopy... an exquisitely fine optical instrument is inserted into
          the uterus through the mother's abdomen, and the child can be
          viewed directly ... The instrument itself is about a foot long, and is
          about one-twelfth of an inch in diameter.  There is a light at the far end
          and an eyepiece at the observer's end ... Sometimes the light is so
          strong that the child flinches when the light is switched on (p. 132).

<P>
          With fetoscopy ... the skin can be observed, and skin diseases have
          been diagnosed in utero ... We can thread a line needle which we can
          insert into a blood vessel of the unborn child and actually carry out
          blood tests on it, even as we can in adult patients.  Thus, we can
          diagnose hemophilia, clotting disorders, sickle cell disease, anemia,
          and a host of other blood disorders.  We can also thread through the
          length of the instrument a biopsy forcep, an instrument which can
          take a piece of tissue for analysis.  In this way, we have been able to
          actually take a biopsy of the liver of the unborn child and study that
          organ with its enzymes and complicated chemistry (p. 133).

<P>
          Another technology which has allowed us to perceive the unborn child
          directly is hysteroscopy.  A hysteroscope is a long slender optical 
instrument, similar to the fetoscope.... with a light at the far end and
          an optical eyepiece at the observer's end.... This instrument is
          pushed up through the cervix in early pregnancy at four, five, or six
          weeks.  Peering through the eyepiece with the light on at the opposite
          end, one can see the six week old infant clearly.  We can even study the
          face.... in fact, the entire young child ... One can see the eyes, count
          the fingers and toes, and even see the blood vessels of the child
          through its incredibly fine, translucent skin! (pp. 134-35).

   <P><LI><A NAME=4></A>    Rejections and refutations of viability as the 
critical point include
         <A HREF=wcited.htm#Blumenfeld>Blumenfeld</A> (1975), p. 150; <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Devine>Devine</A> (1978), pp. 86-87; <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Glover>Glover</A> (1977),
         p. 124-25; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Kluge>Kluge</A> (1975), pp. 30-32; <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Nathanson>Nathanson</A> (1979) pp. 211-13,
      and (1983), p. 148; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Noonan>Noonan</A> (1983), p. 
23; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Singer>Singer</A> (1979a), pp. 
108-110; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Tooley>Tooley</A> (1973), p. 74; and <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Werner>Werner</A> (1979), p. 55.  In the literature
      on abortion that I have studied, I cannot recall a single instance where
      viability was proposed or defended.  The closest thing that comes to
      mind is the U. S. Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade (Jan. 22,
      1973), in which the Court said: "With respect to the State's important
      and legitimate interest in potential life, the 'compelling' point is at
      viability." [Quoted in <A HREF=wcited.htm#Feinberg>Feinberg</A> (1973), 
p. 186 and (1984). p. 196.] It
      did not assert that a person exists after viability.  It went on to say that
      "if the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may
      go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period except when it
      is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother" (Ibid.). After
      viability, there is "fetal life," not a "person," according to the Court.
      What line viability is supposed to mark remains unclear.  The "fetus"
      is a person neither before nor after, according to the Court.  If the
      "fetus" is not an actual human person before viability, as the Court
      maintains, it is surely a potential human person then, for "it"
      obviously develops into an actual human person.  If "it" is a potential
      person both before and after viability, and an actual person neither
      before nor after, what significant point is viability supposed to
      represent?  On what logical basis does a change in regard to "State's
      compelling interest" rest?  See <A HREF=wcited.htm#Singer>Singer</A> 
(1979a), pp. 108-109 for
      another criticism of Roe v. Wade on this point.
<P>
      Though hardly defended in the literature, viability plays a great role
      in popular thinking.  For those who defend abortion, probably the two
      most commonly assumed lines are birth and viability.  Hence, the
      need for an extensive refutation here.

out that "all discussion of viability

   <P><LI><A NAME=13></A>  <A HREF=wcited.htm#Werner>Werner</A>, p. 
64. Another defense of sentience is <A HREF=wcited.htm#Sumner>Sumner</A> 
(1981),
        Chapter 4 and (1984).

   <P><LI><A NAME=14></A>  Sentience marks a very significant line in terms 
of a person's ability
        to think, decide, communicate, etc.; what I have called 
<EM>functioning</EM> as
        a person - in contrast to <EM>beinq</EM> a person, which is the 
all-important category for the question of abortion, and our theme here.  The
        distinction is explained and developed in chapter 7.

   <P><LI><A NAME=15></A>  Drawing the line at the emergence of human form 
is also rejected by
        <A HREF=wcited.htm#Kluge>Kluge</A> (1975). pp. 32-33 and <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Tooley>Tooley</A> (1973). p. 77.

   <P><LI><A NAME=20></A>  <EM>Ibid</EM>.

   <P><LI><A NAME=21></A> Whether the loss of certain brain waves really 
does imply death, and,
        if so, under what conditions, is a complex and disputed question,
        which I shall not enter upon here.  If such loss does not imply death,
        or not in all cases, this is further evidence for the invalidity of Brody's
        argument, further proof of the falseness of his conclusion.  If I assume
        the (possible) truth of the theory that loss of brain waves implies
        death, it is only to give Brodys argument every possible benefit of the
        doubt.

  <P><LI><A NAME=28></A> That is, it would be a radical break if (and only if) 
the frog ceased to
      exist and was replaced by the prince, one being really transformed
      into another; the other actually coming into existence at that moment.  This is 
precisely what happens at conception-fertilization, the
      "frog" corresponding to "sperm and ovum," the "prince" to the newly
      conceived child, in the zygote phase of her existence, as will be shown
      in Chapter 6.) If, on the other hand. the frog and the prince are sup-
      posed to be the same being; that is, one being assuming different
      forms (a prince disguised as a frog), then the frog-prince story cannot
      be used as it is above.  In using it, I am assuming the first (transformation) 
interpretation.

  <P><LI><A NAME=1 ></A> The Agnostic Position is adopted, or assumed, 
mainly in popular
      discussions of the moral question of abortion, and the question of
      what should be its legal status.  It is rarely adopted or defended in the
      literature on the subject.  An instance of this position, or something
      similar to it, can be found in <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Wertheimer>Wertheimer's</A> article (1971), though I am
      not sure that it is his final position.  See pp. 44-45.  Rejection of the
      Agnostic Position is implicit in most of the literature on the morality
      of abortion.  Most writers are concerned with the question of "the
        status of the fetus," whether "it" is a "person," or "it's humanity." They
        advance and try to defend theses that they claim to know; hence, a
        rejection of the view that "no one knows when human life begins."
        Most theories advanced in the literature are precisely theories as to
        when "human life," in the morally relevant sense, begins; when the
        claims of the "fetus" become serious claims or rights that must be
        respected; or when "it acquires moral standing." (Judith Jarvis
        <A HREF=wcited.htm#Thomson>Thomson's</A> article, to be discussed in 
chapter 8, is a notable
        exception.)
<P>
        An explicit rejection of the Agnostic Position is found in <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Sumner>Sumner</A> 
        (1981), pp. 73-81, esp. pp. 78-79.  For example: "Why should the
        moral status of the fetus be less decidable than other moral
        questions?"

   <P><LI><A NAME=2></A>   <A HREF=wcited.htm#Foot>Foot</A> (1967), p. 
29.  Similar sentiments are expressed by <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Sumner>Sumner</A> 
        (1984), p. 73: and <A HREF=wcited.htm#Gillespie>Gillespie</A> (1977). p. 
96, in which he quotes a part of the passage from Foot.

   <P><LI><A NAME=4></A>   <EM>Ibid</EM>. <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Devine>Devine</A> rejects the Gradualist Position; the 
quotations are from
        his presentation of it (pp. 77-82). It is a position which is often
        assumed or advocated by defenders of abortion in popular discussions.  In 
the literature on the subject, different versions have been
        proposed and defended; they include <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Gillespie>Gillespie</A> (1977); <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Sumner>Sumner</A>

   <P><LI><A NAME=5></A>   For a similar refutation see <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Gallagher>Gallagher</A> (1985), p.21. The absolute
        impossibility of a gradual process in the being of a person is clearly
        and convincingly shown by <A HREF=wcited.htm#Crosby>John 
Crosby</A> in his excellent article
        (1976).

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
             If we reflect on the kind of being which we call human being, we
         will find that it admits of no degrees, of no more or less. It makes no
         sense to speak of one man as being more a human being than another.
         It is not just that this does not work linguistically, but rather the impossibility 
to say the thing, reflects an impossibility in the thing itself
         (p. 219).
<P>

         A child whose spiritual and rational powers are just beginning to
         develop certainly has many potentialities which are yet to be developed; 
but its very being as a human being is not one of these
        potentialities; that being is not actualized out of a state of potency as
        the child grows up.  And so it is that man as this kind of being either
        exists entirely, or does not exist at all; there is only this alternative,
        and there is no sliding scale of degrees of being human (p. 220).
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
  Also, I am always myself, the same person:

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
        If we just think of our speaking in the present of what I did or thought
        earlier, we see that an identity of my present self with my self at that
        earlier time is implied.  There is a self-identical self present in all the
        experiences of a given person, a self enabling him to call these
        experiences his <EM>own</EM>; if this self were to change and develop as 
other dimensions of a person do, then this self-identity would be unintelligible (p. 
222).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P><LI><A NAME=6></A>   See <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Gillespie>Gillespie</A> (1977), p. 96, and <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Sumner>Sumner</A> (1984). p. 83.

  <P><LI><A NAME=7></A>   For readers unfamiliar with the logic of the 
Reductio ad Absurdum
       argument, I offer the following.  Whatever implies an absurdity, or a
       falsehood, must itself be false.  For example, "If we get home by
       sundown, we will have traveled at 100 miles per hour." Since (in this
       instance) "we get home by sundown" implies an absurdity, it must be
       false.

  <P><LI><A NAME=9></A>   The thesis that a child is not a person until some 
time after birth has
       been advanced by some philosophers; for example, Michael <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Tooley>Tooley</A>,
       who holds, in his book [(1983), p. 411], that personhood is not
       reached until about three months after birth.  I shall consider Tooley's
       theory in chapter 7.

       human conceptus passes first ... through nonspecific (nonhuman)
       early stages and only thereafter, at about the beginning of the third

       Remnants of this thesis linger on, in the idea that humans pass
       through certain animal-like phases (e.g., a fish-like phase because of
       gill-like organs).  Through the techniques of modern science,
       Blechschmidt tells us, this thesis has been refuted. "Ontogenesis [the
       development of an individual] is a homogeneous, continuous process
       in which there are no breaks." (<EM>Ibid</EM>., p. 7)

 <P><LI><A NAME=25></A> Joseph <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Donceel>Donceel</A> , S.J., defends a version of this view 
in "A Liberal Catholic'sView," (1970).  He terms it <EM>"the theory of mediate or 
delayed animation,"</EM> (p. 16), in contrast to <EM>"the theory of immediate 
animation,"</EM>
      that "a human being . . . [with] a spiritual soul" exists from the
      moment of conception (p. 15).  Donceel's view is that "there is no
      human soul, hence no human person, during the first few weeks of
      pregnancy, as long as the embryo remains in the vegetative stage of
      its development" (p. 18).  He does not espouse the view that this being
      can simply be killed, but rather that "it deserves a very great
      consideration, because it is a living being, endowed with a human
      finality, on its way to hominization."And thus, "that only very serious
      reasons should allow us to terminate Its existence." (pp. 19-20).

 
   <P><LI><A NAME=26></A>  <A HREF=wcited.htm#Donceel>Donceel</A>, in 
trying to support his theory, appeals to what was taught
        "during long centuries." namely, "that the human soul was infused
        into the body only when the latter began to show a human shape or
        outline and possessed the basic human organs.  Before this time, the
        embryo is alive, but in the way in which a plant or an animal is alive.
        it possesses ... a vegetative or an animal soul, not yet a human
        soul.... it has reached the physiological or the psychological, not yet
        the spiritual level of existence.  It is not yet a human person: it is
        evolving, within the womb, toward hominization.

<P>
        Let me offer some reasons for rejecting this theory. (1) Regarding
        "human shape and outline": See chapter 4, sec. 6: present chapter,
        objections and replies 1-3. (2) Regarding "basic human organs": See
        chapter 4. sec. 7. 8; this chapter, objection and reply 2, next chapter,
        pp. 94-97.  That which is to become the developed organ is already
        present in the zygote. The development occurs in one and the same
        being who is there all along.  Bom people need these organs in their
        developed form, the zygote does not, for she is in a different phase of
        her development.  Each, the bom person and the zygote, has what she
        needs; level of development is irrelevant. (3) Regarding the claim that
        the zygote or embryo has not yet reached the spiritual level of
        existence: This can mean only that she cannot yet function as a
        person, not that she lacks the being of a person.  A full analysis of this
        follows, in the next chapter. (4) Regarding the claim that the zygote
        or embryo is alive only in the sense in which a plant or animal is alive:
        We are human beings, alive as human beings from the very beginning
        of our existence, all the way through pregnancy.  Recall the Continuum of 
human life (chapter 1).  "I was once a small child in my
        mother's womb, beginning as a tiny zygote." I was always rnyse!f, a
        person.  <EM>I was never an anirnal!</EM> See also chapter 5, refutation 
of
        GradualistPosition. (5) Regarding the claim that the zygote or embryo
        is evolving towards hominization: On the contrary, a zygote is already
        human, in every sense of the term.  A zygote does not "evolve" into a
        person; she is a person, a small person at the beginning of her
        existence, and development.  See again Gradualist Position, the
        section below ('Is the zygote a person?"), and chapter 7.

   <P><LI><A NAME=27></A> For another criticism of this view, see <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Grisez>Grisez</A> (1972), pp. 282 -83.

   <P><LI><A NAME=28></A> A possible exception to this would be cases of 
identical twins, if either
        (a) they came from a single-celled "parent," who then died, or (b) the
        second was begotten by the first, who was begotten by the adult
      parents (as was the single-celled "parent" in (a)).  But even here, what
      is begotten is, in each case, a human person, and not a mere
      biological organism into which the soul, or being of a person, is later
      infused.  So the essential point remains.

  <P><LI><A NAME=29></A> <A HREF=wcited.htm#Joyce>Joyce</A> (1981), 
p. 346.

  <P><LI><A NAME=30></A> See <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Weisbord>Weisbord</A> (1982), p. 13.

  <P><LI><A NAME=31></A> This is the way it is generally presented.  See, 
e.g., <A HREF=wcited.htm#Weisbord>Weisbord</A> (<EM>Ibid</EM>.)
      where it forms part of his claim that "legalized abortion" is not parallel
      to the Nazi holocaust.

  <P><LI><A NAME=19></A> The Functioning Person Theory, especially in its 
emphasis on the
       distinction between being "merely human" and being a "person"
       (meaning a functioning person), is held by a number of contemporary
       writers in different forms.  See: <A HREF=wcited.htm#Tooley>Tooley</A> 
(1972). pp. 55-69, <EM>passim</EM>;
       (1973), pp. 54-73, <EM>passim</EM> (1979), pp. 84-92; (1983), pp. 50-
157,
       <EM>passim</EM> (1984). <EM>passim</EM> <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Warren>Warren</A> (1973).  <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Fletcher>Fletcher</A> (1979), chapters 1, 10, 11. See also 
<A HREF=wcited.htm#Engelhardt>Engelhardt</A> (1974).  Speaking of a 
"fetus," he says
       "there may be merely human life present but not a person" (p. 321).
       Also <A HREF=wcited.htm#Glover>Glover</A> (1977), pp. 127, 138-40, 
and chapters 3, 9, 11 and 12,
       <EM>passim</EM>; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Singer>Singer</A> (1979a), 
chapter 4 and (1979b); <A HREF=wcited.htm#Sumner>Sumner</A> (1981), pp.
       90 ff.  Finally, <A HREF=wcited.htm#Kluge>Kluge</A> (1975), pp. 88-95, 
esp. 91, where the Theory is
       more restricted in scope than in authors such as Tooley, Singer and
       Warren.

  <P><LI><A NAME=20></A>  <A HREF=wcited.htm#Tooley>Tooley</A> 
(1983), p. 77. This is the conclusion he reaches in section 4.2,
       entitled "The Moral Irrelevance of Species Membership," pp. 61-77.
       See also (1979), p. 67, and (1972), p. 70.

  <P><LI><A NAME=21></A> <A HREF=wcited.htm#Singer>Singer</A> 
(1979a), p.117. Also (1979b), p. 47.

  
<P><LI><A NAME=22></A> Adherents of the Functioning Person Theory recognize that the term
       "human" may be used in a sense other than that of designating a mere
       biological category.  It may mean, as the <EM>Oxford English 
Dictionary</EM>
       says, "of, belonging to, or characteristic of man," or "having or
       showing the qualities or attributes proper to or distinctive of man."
       [<A HREF=wcited.htm#Singer>Singer</A> (1979b), p. 48].  The term "man" 
in this context Is, of course,
       interpreted by adherents of the Functioning Person Theory as
       meaning "functioning person." It would then include only beings who
       had the (present Immediate) capacity to function as persons; that is,
       who had "qualities or attributes we think characteristic of, proper to,
       or distinctive of man" [<EM>Ibid</EM>.], for example, the "characteristic ... 
[of  having] a capacity of self-awareness or self-consciousness" 
[<EM>Ibid</EM>. p. 49] This would mean that we will not count severely 
retarded infants
     as human beings even though they are clearly members of <EM>homo
     sapiens</EM> [the biological species human] (<EM>Ibid</EM>.)." Thus, the 
term "human" is taken by adherents of the theory to be ambiguous between
     "functioning person" and "member of the biological species 'human.'"
     See also <A HREF=wcited.htm#Singer>Singer</A> (1979a). pp. 74-76.  In 
this connection, <A HREF=wcited.htm#Tooley>Tooley</A> says
     that "the tendency to use expressions like 'person' and 'human being'
     interchangeably is an unfortunate one (1972), p. 56.  See also (1973),
     p. 56 and (1983). p. 50.

<P>
     My criticism of the Functioning Person Theory in this section is
     therefore directed to it in so far as it uses the term "human" in one of
     the two meanings just described, namely, "member of the biological
     species 'human.'" It is in this sense that the term is claimed to be "a
     mere biological category."

 <P><LI><A NAME=23></A> <A HREF=wcited.htm#Tooley>Tooley</A> (1983), 
p. 175; see also 193. See <A HREF=wcited.htm#Marquis>Marquis</A> (1989) 
for another
     refutation of views such as those of Tooley that try to justify abortion
     by claiming that the "fetus" is not a person.  Marquis argues that
     abortion is wrong because it denies the "fetus" a valuable future,
     regardless of whether "it" is a person.

 <P><LI><A NAME=29></A> <EM>Ibid</EM>.

 <P><LI><A NAME=30></A> An explicit endorsement of the Achievement View 
is found in <A HREF=wcited.htm#Sumner>Sumner</A>.
     "The future awaiting a human fetus is not relevant to its moral status;
     that status is based on what it has already achieved.  The threshold
     [when "it" achieves moral status, namely at sentience] is a moral
     quantum leap, for it is the stage at which the fetus joins the class of
      beings whose rights are secured by our network of positive laws and
      conventional moral rules" [(1981). p. 227].  When Sunmer says that
      "the paradigm bearer of moral standing is an adult human being with
      normal capacities of intellect, emotion, perception, sensation, deci-
      sion, action, and the like" [(1984), p. 741, he is expressing the
      Achievement View.  The normal human adult has achieved these
      capacities, so he "counts" as a full moral being, a "paradigm bearer
      of moral standing." The "fetus" has not achieved them, at least not
      before sentience, so he lacks moral standing; or at least full moral
      standing.  See also (1981), p. 10.  Another explicit advocate of the
      Achievement View is Ashley <A HREF=wcited.htm#Montagu>Montagu</A>.  
<A HREF=wcited.htm#Devine>Devine</A> tells us that "another
      possible account treats personhood, as Ashley Montagu once said,
      not as an endowment but as an achievement [Letter to the <EM>New York
      Times</EM>, March 9, 1967], an achievement (like the earning of a
      university degree) which confers a certain status on someone as long
      as he is" [(1978), p. 93].  See pp. 93-95 for Devine's criticism of this
      view.  See also <A HREF=wcited.htm#Grisez>Grisez</A> (1972), pp. 278, 
281 for a criticism.

  <P><LI><A NAME=31></A> <A HREF=wcited.htm#Tooley>Tooley</A> 
acknowledges this.  After listing ftfteen "proposals [that] have
      been advanced as to what . . . properties are required" for being a
      .person," In addition to consciousness, he observes that "these alternatives, 
and various combinations of them provide one with quite a
      bewildering selection of candidates for the properties that should
      enter into the definition of the concept of a person" [(1983). p. 90].

 <P><LI><A NAME=49></A>  <EM>Ibid</EM>., p. 154.

 <P><LI><A NAME=50></A>  Where would Tooley "draw the line" after birth? In 
each of his three
      articles on abortion he says: "The practical moral problem can ... be
      satisfactorily handled by choosing some short period of time, such as
      a week after birth, as the interval during which infanticide will be permitted" 
[(1972), p. 79; (1973), p. 91; (1984), p. 133].  In his book this
      period is considerably extended.  "New-bom humans are neither
      persons nor even quasi-persons [see sec. 11.6, pp. 407-12], and their
      destruction is in no way intrinsically wrong.  At about the age of three
      months.... they probably acquire properties that are morally significant, and 
that make it to some extent intrinsically wrong to destroy
      them" [(1983), pp. 411-12].  Even at three months, the killing of a child
      is not as wrong as killing an adult, according to Tooley.  The killing of
       infants, he says is only "eventually ... comparable in seriousness to
       the destruction of a normal adult human being" [<EM>Ibid</EM>., p. 412].

  <P><LI><A NAME=51></A>  This is reflected in <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Sumner>Sumner's</A> question: "To which creatures should 
we distribute (some degree of) moral standing?" [(1981), p. 128].  As if
       "moral standing," the right to be treated with respect as a person,
       were something we could distribute at will!

  <P><LI><A NAME=52></A>  For a profound analysis of reverence, see von <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Hildebrand>Hildebrand</A>, "Reverence" [(1950), pp.  1-15; 
reprinted, (1967), pp. 1-9].  The dignity of a person is closely related to the 
intrinsic value of a person as person,
       which von Hildebrand calls the ontological value of the person.  See
       his analysis, (1953), pp. 129-39.

human person, see

  <P><LI><A NAME=1></A> Brody makes this point when he urges us to reflect 
that "however
      unjust the act of rape, it was not the fetus who committed or commis-
      sioned it.  The injustice of the act, then, should in no way impinge
      upon the rights of the fetus, for it is innocent" [(1976), p. 38].  Also
      <A HREF=wcited.htm#Kluge>Kluge</A>: "As to . . . pregnancy resulting from 
rape, in this case, too,
      abortion will be an act of murder. . . '[(1975)`. p. 98].
<P>

      In addition to Brody, Kluge, Reardon, McCormack and Willke, (see
      notes 3. 4, and 6), other authors who recognize that abortion is not
      justified in the case of pregnancy due to rape include <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Brown>Brown</A> (1977),
      pp. 28-29; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Garton>Garton</A> (1979), pp. 75-79; <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Grisez>Grisez</A> (1972), p. 343; <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Joyce>Joyce</A> 
      (1970). pp. 42-44; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Rice>Rice</A> (1969), pp. 37-39; 
(1979), p. 94; <A HREF=wcited.htm#Whitehead>Whitehead</A>
      (1972), pp. 109-110: and <A HREF=wcited.htm#Young>Young</A> (1983), 
pp. 206-210.

 <P><LI><A NAME=2></A>   I am indebted to Fritz Wenisch for calling my 
attention to this principle.

Rape?" Christian

 <P><LI><A NAME=8></A>   The metaphysical refers to the essential nature of 
reality; for example,
      the nature of time (that it is directional, that one cannot go back in
      time, that one cannot undo the past), the nature of causation, the
      nature of a person (e.g., that a person is one and cannot be split), the
      nature of freedom.

     shows that all the standard arguments advanced for legalizing abortion apply 
with equal logic to legalizing rape.  Legalizing one is as
     absurd, and as morally outrageous, as legalizing the other.

HREF=wcited.htm#Rice>Rice</A> (1969), pp. 41-42.  He
     quotes the Roman poet Ovid: "Women, why will you thrust and pierce
     with an instrument and kill your children not yet bom? That neither
     the tigress has done ... nor did the lioness ever have it in her heart
     to destroy her unborn young."

HREF=wcited.htm#Brennan>Brennan</A> (1983), p. 134.

 <P><LI><A NAME=7></A>  <EM>Ibid</EM>., p. 137.

 <P><LI><A NAME=8></A>  In its <EM>Roe v. Wade</EM> decision of Jan. 22, 
1973, the Supreme Court
     legalized abortion during the time prior to viability, banning all restrictions that 
would protect the child.  In the second trimester, there
     could be regulations, but only to protect "matemal health," not to
        protect the child.  After viability, protection of the child was made an
        option for "the State" and abortion could be forbidden "except where
        it is necessary ... for the preservation of the life or health of the
        mother." [410 U.S. 113 (1973).  Excerpts are reprinted in <A 
HREF=wcited.htm#Feinberg>Feinberg</A> 
        (1984), pp. 192-98.  See p. 197.] The phrase "health of the mother" is
        broad enough to encompass any situation; a woman need only find
        a doctor willing to certify that the abortion is "necessary for her
        health."

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<IMG SRC="logo.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE HEIGHT=69 WIDTH=80><B><FONT SIZE=+3>Indoor Air Pollution</FONT></B><BR>
<P>
In the 1970's, two developments had a profound impact on the quality of the air we breathe, and therefore on our health, while working or living indoors.  An energy crisis forced us to tighten and weatherize our buidings.  While reducing energy costs, these measures also reduced the free flow of fresh air.  Simultaneously, this period saw an increased use of synthetic building materials, plus solvents and other organic compounds around the home or office.
</P>
<P>The combination of energy-efficient efficient buildings with restricted air flow and the new building materials has caused us to breathe more air contaminated with chemical gases and biological particles.  People who work in offices now regularly complain of headaches, dizziness, fatigue, cold- and flu-like symptoms, sore throats and other minor illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Buildings where many people become ill are called "sick."and the phenomenon itself is called <B>Sick Office Syndrome</B>.  The Environmental Protection Agency puts the annual cost to business in lost productivity, extra sick days and direct medical costs at over <B>$10 billion</B> a year.

<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="maint.gif"></TD><TD><P><A NAME="Maint"></A>Outgassing is like evaporation, only with solid materials.  It happens because even the densest solid material isn't really solid.  There are spaces between the molecules.  And molecules can work their way into the atmosphere, just like they do during evaporation.</P><P>All of which would be fine if the evaporating molecules were, say, water molecules.  Unfortunately, they're usually a lot more lethal.  Like formaldehyde molecules.</P><P>They're also constantly bubbling away into the air you breathe.  To make matters worse, today's energy-efficient buildings seal <B>in</B> all the toxic gases so that they tend to accumulate in the indoor environment.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><HR></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="fork2.gif"></TD><TD><P><A NAME="Fork"></A>An increase in cancer rates and in the incidence of respiratory diseases has occurred simultaneously with a massive increase in the use of petrochemical products since the end of WWII.  Of the two major sources of health-threatening indoor pollution, micro-organisms and toxic chemicals both continue to wreak havoc in a rapidly growing number of individuals.  Off-gassing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from commercial and residential buildings and furnishing products are the cause of lawsuits and, more often, permanent illness.</P></TD> </TR>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><HR></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="desk.gif"></TD><TD><A NAME="Desk"></A>Everyone is senstive to chemicals.  Even you.  You might not know it because of an effect called "masking".  Masking is the covering up of a toxic smell with a more pleasant perfumed one or your getting used to an odor and after a while you stop noticing it.  The toxic effects, nonetheless, continue.  That's why you don't notice the toxins released by the building materials around you right now.  Yet the E. P. A. estimates that indoor air pollution kills over 11, 400 people every year.
<P>Right now, for instance, your walls and floors can be outgassing formaldehyde and trichloroethane causing flu-like symptons, headaches, nausea, fatigue and sore throats.  Your carpet and underpadding is releasing an alphabet soup of unpronounceable compounds which can affect your immune system.</P></TD></TR>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><HR></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="carpenter.gif"></TD><TD><A NAME="Carpenter"></A>These pollutants are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which means they are chemically unstable.  They turn into gases or combine with other chemicals.  Then you breathe them.

Out of the 50,000 most common chemicals, there is nothing known about the long-term effects on humans.  They are in paints, stains, varnishes, glues, plastics, vinyls, cleaning supplies, etc.  Every indication, however, from science to common sense, is that they're highly toxic and to be avoided if at all possible.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><HR></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="doc.gif"></TD><TD><A NAME="Doc"></A>Doctors have linked indoor air pollution with ailments from behavioral problems, allergies and respiratory ailments to kidney failure and cancer.  In fact a whole new medical field, "environmental medicine", has evolved .  The neurotoxins have a cumulative effect.  They build up in your body until you reach your threshold.  Then something inside you breaks.  Your immune system having been compromised, you'll have to work all the harder to regain your basic health.  </TD></TR></TABLE>

The screen is rendered in oil on silk, and is composed of six (6) panles which are 22" x 73.5" each.  The panel, when fully extended, measures 132" x 73.5" (11' x 6' 1.5").  The entire work is finished in gold framing and attached by piano hinges from top to bottom.  It then folds up into a 12.5" x 22" x 73.5" monolith.

<IMG SRC="smcanary.gif"><B><FONT SIZE=+3>A CLEAR SIGNAL</FONT></B><BR>
<P>You might think indoor air pollution won't affect you.  But chances are it already has.  Have you ever felt nauseated after painting or cleaning?  Well, that's a neurotoxin for you.</P>
<P>The problem is, these toxins affect you all the time.  You might not feel downright sick,  but maybe you'll feel run-down and headachy as the afternoon wears on.</P>
<P>And it gets worse.  Many of these toxins have a cumulative effect.  That means you never get rid of them - they just collect until you reach your threshold.  Then, something inside you breaks.</P>
<P>In the old days, miners used caged canaries as a warning system.  When the toxic gases in a mineshaft built up enough to kill the canary, the miners knew it was time to leave the shaft.  <B>The 11,400 people that the E.P.A. estimates die from indoor air pollution every year</B> are our own grim warning system.  They are signalling that it's time to leave the old products and move on to something better.</P><BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>YOMA TEXTILES</B> was created in 1987 by partners Kathryn Hinkle and Lee Olson as a transitional upholstery collection with a distinctive, coordinated approach to design development.  Using Asian influence in graphic design, texture and color, the growing range of patterns in the collection can be freely mixed together to create harmonious settings and endless variety.  The fabrics are used in both residential and commercial installations throughout the United States and internationally.  The current line consists of 21 patterns with new additions in the works.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>1) </FONT><B>PARAPLUIE  </B>  Large scale jaquard inspired
by a Japanese black and white paper stencil of umbrellas.  The Matelasse
(French word meaning cushion or padded) construction incorporates the
traditional use of tinsel (Lurex) in tasteful moderation, just sparking the
subtle color combinations.</P>
<center><IMG SRC="para.gif"></center>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>2) </FONT><B>STRIE </B> Unlike most ottoman fabrics, our
focus was to create the illusion of dimension and ribbed texture.  By
weaving the fabric flat, we were able to maintain our abrasion standards.
A true complement to the collection and long awaited coordinate to the
Origami series.</P>
<center><IMG SRC="strie.gif"></center>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>3) </FONT><B>BOITE </B> Subtle box motif created by
combining a satin stripe with a faille construction.  This introduction
marks a change in palette for the collection, with emphasis on softer hues
for residential and hospitality interiors.  Appropriate for upholstery and
drapery alike.</P>
<center><IMG SRC="boite.gif"></center>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT><B>ORIGAMI </B> Bold use of contemporary
geometric design utilizing both ottoman and crepe weaves.  Original
inspiration: Antique gros grain ribbon.</P>

<H1>Welcome to Spec Simple</H1>
<IMG SRC="manuf.jpg"><BR>The <A HREF="info.html"><B>Manufacturer White Pages</B></A> is a searchable database of over 2500 manufacturers of interiors-related products, as well as their regional representatives.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="rooms.jpg"><BR><A HREF="rooms/home.html"><B>Product Rooms</B></A> presents you with a series of Virtual Rooms with clickable product categories; you can find out who makes what class of products.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="match.jpg"><BR><A HREF="seating.html"><B>Product Match</B></A> is a searchable database that allows you to find <I>alternative</I> products.  If you have a product in mind, but it has been discontinued or is too expensive, you can search for alternatives in this database.  At the moment, this database contains only seating products.  Coming soon: Casegoods and Systems.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="build.jpg"><BR>This tool is available only for people running Java-enabled Browser software such as Netscape.  "Build" the kind of product you are looking for on screen, specifying the kind of back, arms, seat, base, upholstery and finish.  As you specify the features you want, the product redraws itself on screen until, when you are satisfied with the way it looks, you can search our database to see who makes a similar product.<B>  [UNDER CONSTRUCTION]</B><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="links.jpg"><BR>A variety of <A HREF="industry.html"><B>links</B></A> to other interior design-related Web sites.<BR><BR>

<H2>This site contains advanced features such as Java.  You need advanced browser software such as Netscape 3.0 (Macintosh) or Netscape 2.0 (PC) to be able to take advantage of our services.</H2>
<H3>Like Yahoo! and Alta Vista, but unlike commercial services such as AOL and CompuServe, we make all the information on our site available at no charge to the browsing public.  This is part of the "open" approach to Internet content providing, in which Netscape is a key player.  They support us, so we support them.</H3>

<CENTER>
<H3>Our Mission</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
Rockford College is an independent private coeducational college with a heritage of integrating
liberal arts with strong professional studies.  Rockford College has a strong commitment to
academic enrichment, creative expression, and community service.

<CENTER>
<H3>Our Philosophy</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Rockford College Office of Continuing Education provides educational programs that help
all members of the community from age six months onward develop their highest capabilities.


<P>
Recognizing the mutually beneficial relationship between Rockford College and the greater
Rockford community, we continually seek to improve and refine course offerings and teaching
methods to keep our educational program vital and valid for the people we serve.

<CENTER>
<H3>Non-Traditional Students</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
Individuals who return to school after pursuing other interests are generally referred to as
"non-traditional students."  At Rockford College, they may be older students who may or may
not have enrolled in a formal degree program or those who are taking courses on a part-time
basis (fewer than 12 credit hours).  Courses are available for academic credit or on a non-credit
(audit) basis.  Advising, registration and most other services for non-traditional students are
handled by the Office of Continuing Education.

<CENTER>
<H3>Our Programs</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
As early as 1919, Rockford College was recognized as one of the first colleges in the United
States to offer classes for working people within the community.  The Office of Continuing
Education and Graduate Studies maintains that historical commitment with a broad range of
educational possibilities.

</CENTER>
<BR>
  <P>You worked hard to get where you are.  You chose courses that were
important for your education.  You are more than ready to meet the
challenge of college, and you want a program that offers you an
opportunity to get something extra from your education.  The Rockford
College Honors Program in Liberal Arts offers you that and more.</P>

  <P>Special courses, broad supporting requirements and extracurricular
events provide you a distinctive academic experience.  Our
interdisciplinary education encompasses art, literature, philosophy,
science, religion, and politics from the time of Homer and Aristotle to
the era of Nietzsche and Freud.  It fosters a deeper understanding of the
cultural and intellectual forces that have shaped our society.</P>

  <P>It is an experience that will enrich your life, no matter what
personal or career path you choose.</P>

  <P>Susan Bates, a 1989 Rockford College graduate who majored in
chemistry with a minor in classical civilization, found the Honors
Program a unifying force in her education.  "I learned to understand and
appreciate the time period covered by the Liberal Arts program as a whole
entity and not just as one discipline," said Bates, who recently
completed a doctorate in chemistry at Washington University in St.
Louis.</P>

  <P>This kind of education gives you a solid background in Western
civilization and helps you excel in whatever major you choose, whether it
is mathematics or English or business administration.  "We have tried to
make the program available to all areas of the college," said Dr. Gordon
Ross, Professor and Chair of the History Department.  "Often, the Honors
Program is even more valuable to accounting and computer science majors
because it is their only significant contact with the humanities."</P>

  <P>Lisa Kerr, a 1985 Honors Program graduate, was a theatre arts major
and now is a Ph.D. candidate in English literature at Loyola University. 
"Since my major was theatre arts, I spent a lot of time in the Clark Arts
Center," she said.  "It was, therefore, especially gratifying to be a
part of the Honors Program so I could take a break from the greasepaint
and immerse myself in some of the most revered texts of Western
Civilization."</P>

<CENTER>              
<A NAME="requirements"></A>
<H2>Academic and Course Requirements</H2>
</CENTER>

  <P>Only superior students are invited to participate in the Honors in
Liberal Arts Program.  Your eligibility is determined through an
evaluation of your academic record.  You should score a 600 on both the
verbal and mathematics sections of the SAT or achieve a composite of 27
on the ACT, rank in the top 10 percent of your high school graduating
class, or merit special consideration.  Transfer students should have a
grade point average of at least a 3.35 in their two most recent college
semesters.</P> 

  <P>Continued enrollment in the Honors Program requires that you
maintain a grade point average of 3.0 (or B) in the core courses with no
grade below a C.  You also will be expected to maintain an overall
cumulative grade point average of 3.0.</P>

  <P>Along with the Honors core courses, you must fulfill special course
requirements in arts, language and literature, and science and
mathematics.  In addition, you must complete up to 12 credit hours of
study in a foreign language or demonstrate proficiency in a foreign
language.

<CENTER>                       
<A NAME="courses"></A>
<H2>The Core Courses</H2>
</CENTER>

  <P>The Honors Program at Rockford College is built around four core
courses--The Ancient World, The Middle Ages, Renaissance and Reformation,
and The Modern World--which you can take at any point in your academic
career.</P>

  <P>These courses are offered in sequence, and it is recommended that
you take them in four consecutive semesters; however you may take the
courses out of sequence if your academic program requires it.</P>
     
  <P>The core courses, taught by a course chairman and another professor,
emphasize primary material; whenever possible, works are read in their
entirety.  For example, in The Ancient World, you will read all of the
Aeneid, not just excerpts.  Also included in the core courses are class
presentations by guest lecturers from the college and the community who
discuss pertinent artistic, historical or religious aspects of the period
being studied.</P>

<CENTER>                        
<A NAME="phibeta"></A>
<H2>Phi Beta Kappa</H2>
</CENTER>

  <P>Election to Phi Beta Kappa, the national scholastic honor society,
is the highest scholarly honor you can receive as an undergraduate.  Only
about 10 percent of the colleges and universities in the United States
are qualified to have a chapter of this prestigious society, and Rockford
College is one of them.  When you complete the Honors Program in Liberal
Arts as part of your bachelor's degree, you automatically meet the course
distribution requirements to be eligible for nomination to Phi Beta
Kappa.  Although completion of the Honors Program does not guarantee
election to Phi Beta Kappa, the majority of Rockford College students
elected in the last decade have completed the Honors Program.</P>

<CENTER>                       
<A NAME="benefits"></A>
<H2>Program Benefits</H2>
</CENTER>

  <P>As an Honors student, you will receive some special privileges.  The
Honors Program lounge is available to you 24 hours a day; it offers a
computer, reference books, and a quiet place to study or to meet with
other honors students.  You also can reserve a study carrel in Howard
Colman Library as an underclassman, a privilege usually reserved for
seniors.  Freshmen and sophomore honors students also are allowed to
pre-register for classes before the rest of their classmates, giving you an
edge in choosing your classes.</P>

  <P>Special events are scheduled frequently.  The Honors Program often
sponsors guest lecturers to speak on campus.  For example, William Scott,
Professor of Classics at Dartmouth College, presented a lecture on
Sophoclean tragedy, and The Most Rev. Thomas Doran, formerly a canon
lawyer at the Vatican and now Bishop of the Diocese of Rockford, spoke on
the Catholic Reformation.  The proximity of Rockford College to Chicago
also gives you ample opportunities to experience world-class museums,
lectures and libraries.  Participation in regional academic conferences,
like the annual meeting of the Midwest Region National Collegiate Honors
Council, is another benefit of the program.</P>

  <P>Above all, there is a special kind of fellowship among Honors
Program students and professors; late-night talks on philosophy, art and
literature are very common.  Dr. Marjorie Slavens, Professor of Spanish
and Chair of the Department of Modern Languages said, "I feel it is
extremely important for excellent students to identify with other
excellent students from other disciplines."  Special relationships
between faculty members and students likewise are very common. 
Professors often will invite students over to their homes for socializing
and discussion.</P>

  <P>The Honors Program benefits you in your other classes as well,
giving you that important intellectual edge.  "Honors students bring a
higher level of sophistication to their upper level courses," says Dr.
Ross.</P>  

  <P>Dr. Slavens recognizes the level of excellence achieved by Honors
Program students.  "If an issue comes up that requires general knowledge
in class, I always call on a Liberal Arts Honors student because I know
he or she has that knowledge," she said.  "It helps me as a teacher
because I can use that student's understanding of the material to teach
other students."</P>

<CENTER>             
<A NAME="life"></A>
<H2>The Honors Program and Life Choices</H2>
</CENTER>

  <P>The Honors Program is not memorizing dates and authors.  Rather, it
promotes a broad understanding of the intellectual history that shapes
our lives today; it teaches you to think in comprehensive terms--to see
the whole picture.  This is the kind of education that prepares you for
life, not just a career.</P>

  <P>"Honors students are in very good shape when they get to graduate and
professional schools," Dr. Ross said.  "Once there, graduates of the
Honors Program already have read the majority of the books on the
suggested reading lists."</P>

  <P>"As a teacher now," program graduate Marianne Minnis '84 explains,
"I believe that the more connections students can make between what they
are learning and what they already know, the more knowledge they will
gain, as opposed to merely collecting isolated facts."</P>

  <P>Thomas Sandquist '85, now an attorney with a prominent regional law
firm in northern Illinois, said his time in the Honors Program
contributed not only to his undergraduate studies but also to his work in
law school and beyond.  "It was an experience that enriched my education
and my career," he said.</P>

  <P>Laura Wasowicz '83, now senior cataloguer of American children's
books at the American Antiquarian Society, agrees.  "As a librarian of a
nineteenth-century children's literature collection, I continually draw
upon my ability to understand the birth, regeneration, and interpretation
of ideas within a cultural context," she explains.  "The Honors Program
provided me the ideal forum for developing this critical ability."</P>

  <P>Find out more about what the Rockford College Honors Program can
mean for you.  Call the Rockford College Office of Enrollment at (800)
892-2984 for an appointment to visit.  We will be happy to arrange for an
interview with a member of the Honors Program.</P>

<center><h3>The Library Facility</h3></center>

<p>

The library is centrally located, within easy walking distance
from classrooms, student activity centers and residence halls. 
It houses approximately 180,000 volumes and 17,200 bound volumes
or periodicals.  The library seating emphasizes individual study
areas which are located throughout the library. Senior students
are encouraged to reserve a library carrel for their personal
use throughout their senior year.  Presently, one third of the
student body could be seated at one time.  The library holdings
can be searched through CD-ROM computer public acccess
catalogs and thousands of journals can be searched through 
networked CD-ROM workstations.  Online search service is
available.  The library has lounges and small group study rooms.
 The copy machines, microform reader-printers,  and
audio-listening facilities are available.  Computers which will
connect to the Internet are planned.

The library's primary purpose is to help students and faculty to
integrate information into knowledge.  In this era of rapid

<H3 align="Center"><A name="Library"> Howard Colman Library </a></h3>
<p>The Howard Colman Library, completed in July 1967, was given a prominent 
central location in the belief that the library truly is the heart of a 
college. It was designed to meet the intellectual needs of the Rockford 
College community as attractively and efficiently as possible. 
Professional librarians are available for special projects, reference 
classes, discussion groups, and bibliographic instruction. As faculty 
members, librarians serve on committees, lecture, and act as advisors to 
student organizations. </p>

<p>The library building has 46,750 square feet and houses, in addition to 
library facilities, the college's computer center, faculty offices, and 
the office of career placement and planning. The library has more than 
175,300 volumes and more than 800 subscriptions to periodicals. Free 
copies of any periodical article not in the library can be provided,and 
on-line bibliographical reference service is offered. Rows of CD-ROM 
computer stations provide easy access to all library holdings and national 
subject indexes. Also available are aids for the blind, such as an electric Braille typewriter and several Lexicon Varispeech II speech time compressor/expanders.</p>

<p>The library has 399 seats, including 245 carrels for individual study, 
six cassette listening stations, three group-study rooms, 16 typing carrels, a microfilm room, archival facilities, a periodical browsing area, lounges, offices and a staff room, a rare book room, as well as space for book circulation and technical processing functions.</p>
<p>The computer center, built in the lower level of the library in 1983, 
houses the college's IBM 4381 mainframe computer and offices for the 
operating staff. Terminals and printers are located in most major campus 
buildings.</p>

For more than 40 years, Rockford College has provided opportunities for graduate study.  The
first Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degrees were awarded in 1952.  Since then, Rockford
College has developed a proud tradition as a teacher of teachers.

<P>
The MAT offers a sound academic tradition which can be tailored to suit individual student
needs.  Our MAT graduates have distinguished themselves in Rockford area schools, in northern
Illinois and around the country.

<P>
The Master of Business Administration degree was begun in 1980 after extensive study of the
needs of the Rockford area business and corporate community.  With these needs in mind, our
MBA program has become a vital and integral part of both the community and college.

<P>
Small classes and a highly qualified, experienced, and dedicated faculty provide our graduate
students an extraordinary learning experience.

<hr>
<p><A NAME="ENTRANCE"></A></p>
<h3>Entrance requirements for freshmen</h3> 
<p>Individuals wishing to
pursue a Rockford College degree 
are expected to have completed a college-preparatory program of
15 units at an accredited 
secondary school. A proper foundation for success will include
four years of English and at 
least three of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Two years of mathematics (algebra and geometry) </li>
<li>One year of history </li>
<li>One year of foreign language </li>
<li>One year of a laboratory science. </li>
</ul>
<p>Persons intending to major in scientific disciplines should
take additional high school courses in 
science and mathematics. Prospective students interested in the
humanities and social studies 
areas should have additional course work in literature, foreign
languages, and history. Freshmen 
who intend to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree
should take both biology and 
chemistry at the high school level. Applicants who have
deficiencies in course work, rank in the 
lower half of their high school class, or have standardized test
scores below the desired level 
may be asked to submit recommendations and a personal statement
before a final admission 
decision is made. Admission requirements for the Five-Year
Bachelor's/Master of Business 
Administration Program and the Honors in Liberal Arts program are
explained in the Special 
Programs section of this catalog. </p>
<p><A NAME="EARLY"></A></p>
<h3>Early admission</h3>
<p>Students who have completed six semesters of secondary school
with a cumulative GPA of at 
least 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) may be considered for admission as
freshmen. Applicants for early 
admission must have personal interviews on campus and should
provide letters of 
recommendation from individuals able to give an objective view of
their potential. Rockford 
College looks for evidence of unusual maturity and stability plus
outstanding academic 
qualifications in candidates for early admission. 
<p><A NAME="TRANSFER"></A></P>
<h3>Transferring credit before matriculation</h3> 
<p>Students may transfer credit from colleges accredited by
professional accrediting associations, 
such as the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.
Students may enter Rockford 
College at the beginning of any semester (or during the summer
session). Transferring credit 
hours for a Rockford College degree program is subject to these
regulations: </p>
<ul>
<li>Official transcripts of all previous collegiate study must be
submitted with the application. 
All course work with grades of &quot;C&quot; or better (grades of
C- are not accepted) from 
accredited colleges and universities will be evaluated and, if
applicable to a bachelor's 
degree, applied to students' degree plans. All course work will
be accepted at the same 
level (i.e., 100,200, etc.) at which it was taken. </li>
<li>Credits accepted from other colleges and universities will be
shown on the Rockford 
College transcript. </li>
<li>Transfer credit will be taken off the records of students who
complete courses at Rockford 
College for which they previously received transfer credit.
Students may receive credit for 
a course only once. </li>
<li>Students' grade point averages do not transfer. To be
eligible for a Rockford College 
degree, students must complete: <ul>
<li>A minimum of 60 semester hours at a four-year institution.
</li>
<li>At least 30 of the last 36 semester hours at Rockford
College. </li>
<li>For each major, at least 15 semester hours, including senior
seminar, in the major 
field at Rockford College. </li>
<li>For each minor, at least eight semester hours in the minor
field at Rockford College.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> Some programs may require students to complete
more semester hours at Rockford 
College than the minimums listed above. </p>
<p><strong>Rock Valley College transfer students</strong></p>
<p>Students who have completed an Associate of Arts degree from
Rock Valley College no earlier 
than the fall semester of 1989 and have been admitted to Rockford
College to pursue Bachelor 
of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science, or Bachelor
of Science in Nursing degrees 
will be granted full junior class standing at Rockford College.
Full junior class standing means 
that the work done by students at Rock Valley will be accepted in
satisfaction of Rockford 
College general education distribution requirements (which do not
include the UDRWOPS 
requirement or the Bachelor of Arts language requirement) and
that all passing grades from 
Rock Valley College will be transferred. These students still
must meet all major and 
degree-specific requirements to qualify for the appropriate
Rockford College degree. </p>
<p><A NAME="SPECIAL"></A></p>
<h3>Special conditions</h3>
<p><strong>Course work from non-accredited schools</strong></p>
<p>Course work completed at non-accredited colleges or
universities will be evaluated when 
individuals apply for admission. The evaluation will determine
which courses will apply to 
Rockford College general education, major, and minor field
requirements. When students 
complete a minimum of 12 semester hours of course work at
Rockford College with a grade of 
&quot;C&quot; or better (grades of C- are not applicable) in all
courses attempted, the approved course 
work from the non-accredited institution(s) will be accepted and
applied to the students' 
Rockford College degrees or majors. </p>
<p>Students may also validate course work from non-accredited
institutions for specified numbers 
of hours by acceptable scores on tests recognized by the college
for such purposes. (See 
College Level Examination Program.) </p>
<p><strong>Students whose first language is not
English</strong></p>
<p>The college encourages applications from a diverse population
and recognizes that, for some 
prospective students, English is not the first language. Through
the admission evaluation 
process, the college may determine that, although students are
academically prepared for 
college coursework, their knowledge of and skills in written and
spoken English are not 
sufficient for participation in college level classes. Applicants
who sometimes are included in 
this group are foreign nationals and other non-native speakers,
as well as immigrants who have 
citizenship or legal resident status. In such cases, admission
may be contingent upon 
achievement of a particular TOEFL, SAT or ACT score. These
students sometimes will be 
required to participate in English as a second language (ESL)
classes first or may be permitted 
to enroll part-time in ESL classes and academic courses until the
language requirement is met 
through re-testing at the college. At the time that the specified
contingency is satisfied, students 
are fully admitted and are permitted to enroll as degree
candidates. </p>
<p><A NAME="INTERADMIN"></A></p>
<h3>International admission</h3>
<p>Rockford College actively recruits international students.
Admission is based on analysis of the 
written application, secondary school records and diploma, proof
of financial support, and 
TOEFL score of 525 for a full-time academic program. For the
graduate program, three 
references and appropriate test scores (GMAT for Master of
Business Administration and GRE 
for Master of Arts in Teaching) also are required. </p>
<p><A NAME="INTEREVAL"></A></p>
<h3>International student evaluation</h3>
<p>Rockford College recognizes the International Baccalaureate
(IB) and offers advanced credit in 
appropriate cases. Students receiving a score of 4 to 7 on the IB
higher level may be considered 
for eight semester hours of credit per subject or 24 semester
hours of credit for the thirteenth 
year. Up to six more semester hours of credit are possible with
the appropriate Rockford 
College department chair's recommendation. Subsidiary level
examinations will not receive 
advanced credit. For other thirteenth-year programs, such as the
German Abitur or the Icelandic 
Students Prof, 24 semester hours of credit will be awarded for
course work that is equivalent to 
course work at Rockford College. Up to six more semester hours of
credit are possible with the 
appropriate Rockford College department chair's recommendation.
<p>For the British G.C.S.E. system, students must present passes
in five subjects, including two at 
A-level, for admission to the college. For students who have no
A-level passes, evidence of 
equivalent academic work beyond the O-level standard is needed
for admission to the college. 
For A-level passes, scores of A-C will be awarded eight semester
hours of credit per pass. 
Scores of D and E will receive four semester hours of credit per
pass.</p>
<p><A NAME="HONOR"></A></p>
<h3>Honor code</h3>
<p>Students enrolling at Rockford College agree to comply with
the Academic Honor Code which 
demands absolute integrity in all academic relationships. For
example, students are expected to 
adhere to the Honor Code during examinations, which normally are
given without faculty 
supervision. The Academic Honor Code strictly rejects plagiarism
and cheating, prohibits 
falsification of attendance at Forum Series events, and requires
adherence to the academic 
regulations of the Howard Colman Library and other college
facilities. Although formal written 
acceptance of the Honor Code is not required, acceptance and
understanding of this code is 
required for enrollment. </p>
<p><A NAME="ADVSTAND"></A></p>
<h3>Advanced standing</h3>
<p><strong>Advanced Placement (CEEB)</strong></p>
<p>Rockford College grants placement and/or credit for the
College Entrance Examination Board 
(CEEB) advanced placement examination. The CEEB grading scale is
as follows: 5-extremely 
well qualified, 4-well qualified, 3-qualified, 2-possibly
qualified, 1-no recommendation. 
Students who receive a score of 4 or 5 will be granted Rockford
College credit. Advanced 
placement and the number of credits awarded are determined by
individual departments.

<p>Students who earn sufficient credits (30 semester hours)
through Advanced Placement exams 
will be granted sophomore standing. </p>
<p><A NAME="CLEP"></A></p>
<h3>College Level Examination Program (CLEP)</h3>
<p>CLEP exams may be used to demonstrate an understanding of the
content and experience 
equivalent to the first year of college (general examinations) or
specific courses (subject 
examinations). For a score of 500 or higher on a general
examination, students will be granted 
six semester hours of credit at the 100 level. Four of these
hours can be applied to the 
appropriate distribution requirement. For a score of 50 or higher
on a subject examination, 
students will receive equivalent course credit of three or four
semester hours. Students may earn 
no more than 30 semester hours with the general examination and
no more than 64 hours through 
a combination of the general and subject exams. The essay
sections of CLEP exams are 
mandatory, with exceptions permitted for transfer students who
received CLEP credit at another 
school. CLEP credit will be treated the same as transfer credit,
and the same requirement 
regarding major hours and 300-400 level courses applies to
students receiving CLEP credit.</p> 
<p>Rockford College will use subject exams at the 40th percentile as
an alternative method of 
validating freshman and sophomore-level transfer credit from
unaccredited schools. 
<p><strong>College credit for high school students: 
The Early Scholars Program</strong></p>
<p>Students who have completed their 
junior year in high school may be eligible to register for
college level courses at the college. 
Applicants should complete the Early Scholars Program
Application, submit high school 
transcripts and test scores, and present a recommendation from
their high school principal or 
guidance counselor. After review of the application credentials,
admission to the program will 
be authorized by the Vice President for Enrollment Management.
Students in this program are 
carefully monitored in order to ensure their success and are
required to have faculty approval 
for their coursework. </p>
<p><A NAME="CREDITEXAM"></A></p>
<h3>Credit by examination</h3>
<p>Students may petition the Registrar to take examinations for
exemption or credit in any course 
except the senior seminar. The college will charge a fee of $20
per exam or course, as 
appropriate. </p>
<p><A NAME="PEACECORP"></A></p>
<h3>Peace Corps volunteers</h3>
<p>Rockford College grants 15 hours of academic credit for
successful completion of the training 
program and a satisfactory tour of duty in the Peace Corps. These
students may petition the chair 
of the Department of Modern Languages to have the foreign
language requirement waived for the 
Bachelor of Arts degree. </p>
<p><A NAME="ENTERING"></A></p>
<h3>Placement policies for entering students</h3>
<p>College admission examinations (SAT or ACT) or department
placement examinations are used 
to determine the level of courses in which students should be
placed. These examinations are 
given to ensure that students are placed in courses for which
they have the appropriate 
background. </p>
<p><A NAME="ENGLISH"></A></p>
<h3>Placement policy in English</h3>
<p>During orientation, freshmen who have not submitted ACT or SAT
scores and transfer students 
who have not transferred six hours of freshman English from
another college with grades of C or 
above are required to take an English Placement examination. On
the basis of the exam score, 
students are placed in English 110 or 111. Students must be
exempt from or pass English 110 
before taking English 111. The placement examination will be
given during each orientation 
period. </p>
<p><A NAME="READING"></A></p>
<h3>Placement policy in reading</h3>
<p>During orientation, entering students without appropriate
college admission test scores are 
required to take a reading examination at the Learning Resources
Center. Students who score at 
or above the 32nd percentile have met the reading requirement for
graduation. Those whose 
score is below the 32nd percentile must enroll in LRC 040,
Reading and Study Skills, during 
their first semester at Rockford College and must complete the
course successfully to be eligible 
for graduation. Transfer students who are native speakers of
English and have not taken the ACT 
Reading Subtest in high school shall be exempt from taking
Rockford College's Nelson-Denny 
Reading Test if they have a GPA of 3.5 or better (or equivalent
on a 4 point scale). Transfer 
students who are non-native speakers of English must have a 3.5
GPA (or equivalent on a 4 
point scale) and achieve a score of 53 on the reading subtest of
the TOEFL exam to be exempt 
from taking the reading test. Students who do not take the
reading exam, or do not enroll in the 
reading course if it is required, may not enroll in more than 12
credit hours and may not take 
independent study or tutorial courses until the reading
deficiency has been eliminated. Students 
who are enrolled in the reading course are limited to a semester
course load of 14 hours 
(including the LRC 040). </p>
<p><A NAME="MATHMATICS"></A></p>
<h3>Placement policy in mathematics</h3>
<p>The mathematics placement examination is administered during
orientation. Those studentswho 
have not submitted SAT or ACT scores are required to take the
mathematics placement 
examination. Mathematics placement is based on placement exam
scores of 1 to 5 as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5</strong> Student may enroll in courses beyond Math
130 but may not enroll in Math 130 without 
approval of the department chair. </li>
<li><strong>4 </strong>Student may take Math 130, 223, or 224 or
Computer Science 100 or 110, but may not 
take math modules (Math 106-109). </li>
<li><strong>3</strong> Student may take Computer Science 100 or
110 or Math 223 or 224 or some of the math 
modules. The student must take the pre-test and confer with the
department chair before 
taking the math modules. </li>
<li><strong>2</strong> Student may take Math 101 or the math
modules following the pre-test, or Computer 
Science but may not take Math 130 before taking the math modules.
</li>
<li><strong>1</strong> Student may not take math courses without
completing work in intermediate algebra or 
other remedial work and conferring with the department
chair.</li>
</ul>
<p><A NAME="FOREIGN"></A></p>
<h3>Placement policy in foreign languages</h3>
<p>Entering students are required to take the foreign language
placement examination during 
orientation if they have studied French, German, Spanish, Greek,
or Latin for two years or more 
in high school or if they have not completed a four-hour
intermediate level college course in a 
modern language or six hours at the intermediate level in a
classical language. Students should 
not take this examination if they have not studied a foreign
language for at least two years in high 
school. Native speakers of a foreign language who have completed
their secondary education in 
a school where that language is the primary language of
instruction are exempt from the foreign 
language requirement. Students of Greek or Latin are placed in
203-level courses with scores of 
450 and are exempt with scores of 575. </p>
<p><A NAME="REGNEW"></A></p>
<h3>Registration for new students</h3>
<p>New freshmen and transfer students are eligible to
pre-register after they have paid tuition 
deposits to the college. Students with tuition deposits on file
will be sent pre-registration 
information when the pre-registration begins in late spring for
the fall semester and in early 
December for the spring semester. Faculty advisors will be
available to plan student academic 
programs for the semester. During this process, students and
advisors will sketch out a tentative 
degree program and the advisors will answer student questions. At
orientation, new students 
meet with their faculty advisors in person and finalize their
course schedules for the upcoming 
semester. New students must complete all required paperwork for
financial aid and make 
payment arrangements with the Business Office prior to the
beginning of the semester before 
they can complete the official registration process. </p>
<p><A NAME="REGENROLLED"></A></p>
<h3>Registration for enrolled students</h3>
<p>Enrolled students pre-register in November for the spring and
in April for the fall and summer 
terms. Students select courses in consultation with their
advisors and return their program cards, 
signed by their advisors, to the Office of Registration. Prior to
the start of the semester, students 
must complete all required paperwork for financial aid and make
payment arrangements with 
the Business Office before they can complete the official
registration process. </p>
<p><A NAME="ADVISING"></A></p>
<h3>Advising system</h3>
<p>Rockford College is extremely proud of the close relationships
that develop between students 
and faculty members. Many students retain close ties with faculty
members long after 
graduating. All entering students are assigned faculty advisors
who help them plan a program of 
study. Freshmen students are assigned to members of the Freshman
Advising Team. Transfer 
students are assigned advisors in their major field of study.
Faculty advisors will assist students 
in selecting appropriate courses and in exploring major fields,
graduate study, and career 
opportunities. Advisors will also monitor students' progress
toward completing general 
education requirements and major and/or minor field
requirements.Although advisors assist 
students with academic planning, students are responsible for
determining their own goals and 
for completion of all degree requirements in effect at the time
of their initial enrollment. 
<strong>Students should retain this catalog throughout their careers at
Rockford College to verify these 
requirements.</strong></p> 
<p>Students who decline to accept appropriate academic
advice from their advisors 
may be required to sign a form waiving their advisors'
responsibility for students' academic 
programs. This form is available in the Office of Registration.

<P>The Career Planning and Placement Office provides comprehensive services for all students
no matter what  age and career goals.  Personalized placement services are available to graduate
students and alumni.  The services vary from providing personal consulting, reviewing current resources and arranging practical experiences while
reaching career planning goals. The office also provides interest inventories to determine
specific career needs and applicable placement activities to meet immediate and future goals.
Each semester,  David Klepitsch, the Director, presents seminars for honing student placement
skills like resume writing, job searching strategies and interviewing techniques. The
presentations are to classes, residence hall floors,  and clubs. He also maintains external relations
with employers, graduate schools and alumni.  Marjean Silberhorn, the Office Manager, is the liaison for
inter-office relations and she schedules appointments with the Director.  Peer Advisors are
liaisons to the student body because they are well trained in career planning and placement
techniques. Special programs like the Annual Career Fair and Senior Mock Interview Day are
just a sampling of the popular programs. The comprehensive career library has extensive current
job listings from employers looking for seasoned and recent graduates. It also has free information concerning
graduate school entrance examinations and resources.  Local employers and campus departments
regularly list part-time, seasonal and internship positions in the office.

<CENTER>
<H1>Student Life: Intramurals</H1>
</CENTER>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<P>
Competitive sports and recreational activities are a desirable
part of a student's education.  At Rockford College, it is our
hope that through participation individuals will develop an
appreciation of this use of leisure time and a wholesome attitude
toward physical activity for recreational purposes.

<P>
The Intramural Department desires to conduct activities of
interest to the men and women of Rockford College, including
students, faculty, and staff.  Our aim is to provided an
opportunity for every individual, regardless of skill, to
participate in some activity.  During the fall and spring
seasons, team and individual sports are offered.  (For team
sports, sign-up is handled on a team and individual basis to
facilitate the inclusion  of all interested participants on a
team and to assist teams to fill their rosters.)
<br>
<br>
<h3>Intramural Events, in sequential order</h3>

<P>
Fall 1995: <br><br>
Men's Volleyball League <br>
Women's Volleyball League <br>
Flag Football League <br>
Tennis (singles and doubles) <br>
Family Badminton Tournament <br>
Bowling League (singles) <br>
Badminton (singles and doubles) <br>
Archery Tournament <br>

<p>   
Spring 1996: <br><br>
Men's Basketball League <br>
Women's Basketball League <br>
Bowling League (doubles) <br>
Badminton (singles and doubles) <br>
Archery Tournament <br>
Volleyball League (coed) <br>
Tennis (singles and doubles) <br>



<br>
<h3>Entry Forms</h3>

<P>
All entries for team league play must be submitted on an Official
Intramural Entry Form.  Blank forms are available in the
Intramural Box in the Student Services Offices.  No team entry
will be accepted after the posted deadline, since brackets and
team schedules are based upon the number of teams registered by
the deadline.  Official registration for tournaments and bowling
leagues is on sign-up sheets posted on the I.M. bulletin
board in Burpee Center at least one week prior to the scheduled
event.  (For tournaments, players may sign-up at the tournament
if they are present before play begins and there is still room.)

<br><br>
<h3>Playoffs</h3>

<P>
The top two teams from each division in a league will compete in
the playoff with the final two teams competing for the
Intramural Championship of the sport.

<P>
In the double elimination tournaments, players are guaranteed at
least two games and are eliminated once they have lost two games. 
The winner is the player having no more that one loss.

<br><br>
<h3>Championship Awards</h3>

<P>
The winner(s) of each intramural event will receive an Intramural
Championship t-shirt.  A trophy is awarded to the over-all
winner(s) of the bowling league.

<br><br>
<h3>Participation Awards</h3>

<P>
An Intramural Athlete t-shirt will be given to every player
acquiring seven (7) participation points during one semester. 
Each player participating as a player or coach in an intramural
league game (or match) receives one participation point.  Players
participating in a tournament receive two participation points.

<P>
Each semester, there will be an opportunity to earn 20-22
participation points.  Only one Intramural Athlete t-shirt may
be earned by each person each semester.

<P>
If a team forfeits a game, no participation points will be given
to any players on that team.  If the opposing team does not also
forfeit, the players of that team will receive participation
points.

<P>
Players are responsible for signing their own name on the
participant sign-in sheet before the start of competition.  The
Intramural Supervisor will have the sheet available only before
the start of the game.  Players who are late will not receive a
participation point but may still compete.  For the bowling
leagues, the bowling recap sheets are used to record
participation.


<br><br>
<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<P>
The purpose of eligibility rules is to provide an equitable
program for Rockford College students, faculty, and staff.  The
rules serve as a guide to enjoyable participation.   They were
not designed with the intent to "expose" or "punish" violators. 
It is hoped that such negative procedures will be unnecessary.

<P>
In order to maintain a positive spirit, it is essential that
every participant abide by the rules and enlist the support of
all team members.  The net result will be a successful intramural
program for all.

<p>

1.  Players are responsible for their own eligibility and each
captain is responsible for the team's eligibility.  Any doubts
about the eligibility of a player should be referred to the
Intramural Director for a ruling.  Teams may not play ineligible
players even with mutual agreement of both teams.

<p>
2.  All Rockford College students (part- and full-time, graduate,
and undergraduate), faculty, and staff are eligible to
participate.

<p>
3.  All participants playing for a team must remain with that
same team throughout the sport.

<p>
4.  A player competing under an assumed name will be barred from
intramural competition for a calendar year.  Any team using an
ineligible player shall forfeit all games in which that player
participated and that team will not receive any "participation
points."

<p>
5.  Any student  who has played in a varsity-level game or match
will be ineligible to participate in a related intramural event
for that semester.

<p>
6.  Students who are barred from any intercollegiate sports
because of professionalism violations are barred from the same or
related sport in the intramural program.

<H3 align =center><A Name="COR">City of Rockford</a></h3>

<p><IMG Align="right" SRC="/images/airiel.gif">The Rockford College campus comprises 130 acres of gently rolling, partially-wooded land near the eastern edge of the second-largest city in Illinois. Rockford is located along the Rock River midway between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River, 20 miles from the northern border of the state. Rockford has a vigorous cultural life. Art exhibits, festivals, and shows are scheduled year round. Resident dance and theatre companies, several choral oranizations, and the Rockford Symphony Orchestra provide productions and concerts. Ten museums offer a variety of educational opportunities. Local park systems _ a model for many in the nation _ include several paved bike and jogging trails and 11 public and private golf courses. Of course, the Rock River itself provides a wealth of recreational possibilities in all seasons.</p>
<p>Rockford is just a 90-minute drive from Chicago, Milwaukee, and Madison, with easy access to interstate highways and tollways. The Greater Rockford Airport provides daily flights to various cities, including Chicago. O'Hare Airport is 50 minutes by car, with hourly bus service from several stops in Rockford. </p>

<H3 align =center><A Name="HORC">The history of Rockford College</a></h3>

<p align=center><IMG SRC="/images/oldcamp.gif"></p>
<p>In 1847, during one of the great college-building eras in American history, Rockford Female Seminary was chartered by the Illinois legislature. The citizens of Rockford (population 2,500) pledged $3,500 to erect a building for theambitious enterprise.</p>
<p>Anna Peck Sill became the first principal of the seminary, taking the post "on her own responsibility" _ that is, without wages or promise of students. Enrollment grew quickly. The first classes were held in the old downtown courthouse. Soon, however, the seminary moved to its own campus between the Rock River and Seminary Street. More than a century later, in the mid-1960s, the college moved to its present location at the eastern edge of the city.</p>
<p>Rockford College was an educational pioneer from the very beginning. In the 1840s, when Americans still doubted the value of educating women, the decision to make the curriculum at Rockford Female Seminary as demanding as that of a men's college was a bold one, and the college continued to display its pioneering spirit in the decades that followed. In 1882, Rockford Female Seminary granted its first bachelor's degrees. In 1892, Rockford Female Seminary became Rockford College. </p>
<p>The college was involved early in the development of adult education, offering the first such courses in 1919. In 1952, responding to a need in the community, the college opened its Learning Resources Center to help young people and adults improve their academic skills.</p>
<p>Men were first admitted to classes during World War II, when Rockford College offered cooperative educational programs with the Illinois Institute of Technology. Rockford College became fully coeducational in 1958.</p>
<p>Rockford College provides liberal arts, preprofessional and professional programs for degree-seeking students and for individuals seeking personal or career growth. The college encourages in its students the fullest development of intellectual capabilities, creative expression, and community responsibility.</p>

<H3 align =center><A Name="JANE">The tradition of Jane Addams</a></h3>

<p><IMG Align="left" SRC="/images/jane.gif">The Rockford College heritage of striving for excellence and recognizing those who have attained it is symbolized by Jane Addams, the most notable alumna of the college. She was the daughter of John Addams, who was an early Illinois legislator, friend of Abraham Lincoln, and trustee of the college. Jane Addams was president and valedictory speaker for the class of 1881 and returned to receive her Bachelor of Arts degree the following year when RockfordFemale Seminary began granting degrees. </p>
<p>Jane Addams devoted her life to the causes of peace and justice. She is best known as founder of Hull House in Chicago, a pioneer social work and settlement house that provided many services for the poor and for immigrants. As a tireless crusader for social reforms, she championed women's right to vote, the need for trained social workers, the eight-hour workday for women, child labor laws, juvenile courts, unemployment relief, and social insurance. </p>
<p>In 1931, her efforts and accomplishments were recognized when she received the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>In 1947, as part of the Rockford College centennial celebration, the college inaugurated the Jane Addams Medal to honor women who, like Jane Addams, have achieved preeminence in their chosen profession and made significant contributions to culture and society. The bronze relief medallion was designed by Chicago artist and Rockford College faculty member Andrene Kauffman.</p>

<H3 align =center><A Name="PBK">The tradition of Phi Beta Kappa</a></h3>

<p>Among the 78 four-year colleges and universities in the State of Illinois, Rockford College is one of only nine which can offer membership in Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
<p>Since the founding of Phi Beta Kappa at Williamsburg, Va., in 1776, invitation to membership in this select honorary society has been the American scholar's most coveted and most treasured honor. For more than 200 years, Phi Beta Kappa has symbolized superior ability, the pursuit of excellence, and high achievement. Invitation to membershipis limited to a select number of outstanding scholars. Candidates for both B.A. and B.S. degrees are eligible for election if they meet the foreign language and mathematics requirements for the national organization and the criteria established by the local chapter.</p>
<p>Each year the Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar Program brings a distinguished scholar to the campus to present a series of lectures and seminars, engage in informal discussion, and enrich the intellectual, cultural, and social life of the campus. </p>
<p>At commencement each year, the Phi Beta Kappa prize is awarded to the senior bachelor's degree candidate with the highest cumulative grade-point average for the complete four years of study, including transfer work. The student must complete the equivalent of at least six semesters of full-time study at Rockford College and must be a Phi Beta Kappa electee. </p>
<p>Phi Beta Kappa also presents prizes each year to freshmen, sophomores, and juniors who have distinguished themselves academically during the previous year's study. </p>

<H2>Rockford College Music Academy</H2>
</CENTER>

<BR CLEAR>
<BR>
<P>
The Rockford College Music Academy was established in 1985 to provide high quality
instruction and experience in instrumental and vocal music for community residents from age six
months through adult.

<P>
Music Academy classes and lessons develop music skills, encourage creative expression and a
love of the arts, and reward participants with the pleasure of making music.  These programs
enhance and promote the cultural community and further the strong ties between Rockford
College and the Rockford area.

<CENTER>
<H3>For Music Students of All Ages</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
The Music Academy of Rockford College is dedicated to the philosophy that music enhances the
quality of life at all ages.  Kodaly, the great Hungarian composer and educator, said it well:
"Music is a spiritual food for everybody ... not a toy for a few selected people."

<P>
The arts provide a holistic approach to development of personality, emotion, and intellect.  The
Music Academy approach to early music education is based on the child's instinctive and joyful
love of music and involves the parent in all activities.  The development of self-discipline and
self-esteem through success in small steps is encouraged at all levels.

<CENTER>
<H3>Music for the Young Child</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
These programs involve children and a "caregiver," who may be a parent or anyone who interacts
with the child regularly.  Classes begin in September, February and June each year.

<UL>
<LI> <B>Love Notes</B> is for children six months to three years old.  Finger play, counting
games, vocalization, bounces, tickles and listening experiences build musical and social skills
and promote bonding between child and caregiver.

<LI> <B>Kinder Kalliope</B> is for children three to four years of age.  The child and caregiver
sing, move to, create and listen to simple chants and songs from a variety of cultures.  Caregivers
are encouraged to use music to make learning a joyful, joint, and ongoing project.

<LI> <B>Kinder Singers</B> is for children four to six years old.  At this age, children are more
ready for precise musical activities.  We begin listening for rhythmic patterns, matching pitches
and learning songs where pitch, rhythm, melody and tone color are combined in an art form.  The
caregiver is an observer.

<LI> <B>Discovery Training Choir</B> is for ages six to eight.  Students receive vocal training
with emphasis on musical skill development.  Activities include ear training, sight-singing, and
early part singing, as well as refining vocal production, improving intonation and increasing
music reading and writing skills.  
</UL>

<CENTER>
<H3>Student Offerings</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Music Academy strives to offer a complete music education extending beyond the private
lesson to include musicianship and theory classes as well as large and small ensemble coaching. 
Offerings include:

<UL>
<LI> Piano Repertoire/Musicianship Classes
<LI> Suzuki String Repertoire and Reading Classes
<LI> String Orchestra and Ensembles
<LI> String Quartets
<LI> Mixed Ensembles
<LI> Private Traditional Lessons - Private lessons are available for piano, violin, viola and cello. 
Children may begin at age seven.
<LI> Suzuki Talent Education - Shinichi Suzuki calls his method of teaching the violin, viola,
cello or piano the "mother tongue method" and believes that children can learn to play an
instrument as easily as they learn to speak their native language.  A close parent-child
relationship in an environment of encouragement, understanding, repetition, and imitation is
necessary for this method to succeed.  Children may begin at age three or four.
</UL>

<CENTER>
<H3>Summer Camps for Children</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
Rockford College Music Academy offers high quality affordable summer programs for area
children from age five through high school.  Opportunities include:
 <UL>
<LI> <B>Carousel</B> - a popular integrated summer arts day camp
<LI> <B>Chamber Music Camp</B> - open to Suzuki and traditional students from "Twinkle"
to intermediate level
<LI> <B>String and Piano Camp</B> - open to students of intermediate ability and beyond
</UL>

<CENTER>
<H3>Adult Offerings</H3>
</CENTER>

<B>Music Appreciation - Adults</B>
<P>
Learn to understand and enjoy the classics through guided listening, discussions, lectures and
field trips.  Each semester new periods of music are discussed.  Join us for this fun, sociable
exposure to some of the world's finest music.  Classes begin in September and February.

<P>
<B>Private Lessons</B>
<P>
Private lessons are available for adults on piano, violin, viola and cello.

<H4>Call Martha Frantz, Director of the Rockford College Music Academy, at (815) 226-4168

First organized by Rockford College in 1991 and held every two years, UnCommon Lives is a
week-long community event exploring contemporary women's contributions to the arts. 
UnCommon Lives provides opportunities for community members to experience performances
and participate in educational activities led by prominent artists in the fields of dance, literature,
visual arts, theater, and music.

<p>
Performances, workshops, master classes, and discussions will be held on the Rockford College
campus and throughout the community at civic centers, public schools, and theaters. 

<p>
Watch this site for specific times and further information to be announced at a later date.

<p>
<b>Libby Larsen</b>, one of the most successful composers in the Unites States, has received
NEA Composer Fellowships as well as commissions from the American Composers Orchestra
and artists Eugenia Zukerman and Arleen Auger.  In 1973, she co-founded the Minnesota
Composer's Forum, a cooperative which was the model for the promotion of American
composers.  

<p>
As part of UnCommon Lives, Ms. Larsen will meet with community members to talk about her
life as an artist and to discuss her work "Mary Cassatt", a unique multimedia piece for mezzo
soprano, trombone soloist, and orchestra.  Based on the life of American impressionist painter
Mary Cassatt, the work includes overhead projections of Cassatt's paintings and excerpts from
her correspondence, chronicling her life as a struggling artist in the late 19th century.

<p>
UnCommon Lives is also collaborating with the Rockford Symphony Orchestra, which will
perform "Mary Cassatt" as part of the UnCommon Lives series.  <b>Saturday, March 15</b>

<p>
<b>Gloria Naylor</b>, writer for theater, film, and television, and author of the novels, <i>The
Women of Brewster Place, Linden Hills, Mama Day</I>, and <i>Bailey's Cafe</I>, has won
Guggenheim, NEA, and New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowships.  Her novels have been
translated into twelve languages.

<p>
For UnCommon Lives, Ms Naylor will lead a writing workshop for high school and college
students and give a public reading which will be followed by audience questions.  <b>Monday,
March 17</b>

<p>
<b>Chicago Moving Company</b>, a nationally celebrated dance company noted for its
energetic performances and pioneering community involvement programs, received an NEA
partnership for their ArtStretch program in inner-city Chicago schools.  Founded in 1972, CMC
is a nine-member company whose choreography reflects founder Nina Shineflug's artistic vision.  
CMC's primary mission is to bring a dynamic, creative, and personal dance experience to its
audiences and students, including populations with limited access to the performing arts.  CMC
is noted for its superb programs for special populations, such as mentally and physically disabled
people, young people, and those in inner city settings.

<p>
CMC's residency for UnCommon Lives includes a public performance on <b>Wednesday,
March 19</b> as well as extended work with Rockford College students and the Rockford Dance
Company (RDC) to develop an original performance of "Intersections", which includes
choreography drawn from the participants.  CMC and the RDC will work with students from
Ellis, Stiles, and Haskell Elementary Schools and with clients from the Goldie Floberg Center for
the developmentally disabled to create an original interpretation of the piece, based on the
participants' abilities.  <b>Friday, March 21</b>

<p>
<b>Wendy Wasserstein</b>, Pulitzer Prize winning author and playwright, has received
numerous awards and was the first woman to win a Tony Award for her play <i>The Heidi
Chronicles</I>.  Her play, <i>Uncommon Women and Others,</I> was adapted for PBS, and her
most recent work, <i>The Sisters Rosensweig,</I> has enjoyed runs on Broadway and in
London.  

<p>
UnCommon Lives is collaborating with the New American Theater, which will perform Ms.
Wasserstein's play, <i>The Heidi Chronicles</I>.  Ms. Wasserstein will lead a post-performance
discussion of the work.  She also will give a luncheon talk entitled, "A Life in the Theater". 
Wireless headsets designed for the hearing impaired will be available for the play and the
post-performance discussion. <b>Tuesday, March 18</b>

<p>
<b>CELLO</b>, a quartet of classically trained cellists whose repertoire includes jazz, pop, and
classical pieces, has performed at Lincoln Center, Weill Recital Hall, and for the Van Cliburn
Foundation.  Created in 1988, CELLO performs a mix of accessible music which, coupled with
their inviting way with audiences, has brought them both critical and popular acclaim.  The four
women (founder Caryl Paisner, Laura Koehl, Maureen McDermott, and Maria Kitsopoulos) have
studied at Julliard and Yale.  

<p>
CELLO's UnCommon Lives activities include a full-length concert and master classes for
cellists and cello instructors from area colleges. <b>Thursday, March 20</b>

<p>
 <b>"Focused,"</b> an exhibition of vintage works by early women photographers, will be on
display in the Rockford College Art Gallery, Clark Arts Center, from March 21 through April 2,
1997.  The exhibit will feature the work of <b>Berenice Abbott, Gertrude Kasebier, Laura
Gilpin,</b> and <b>Imogen Cunningham</b>, women who succeeded in that new medium
through sheer will and determination.  The exhibit is presented by the Rockford College Art
Gallery in cooperation with the Andrew Smith Gallery of Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Photographer
<b>Anne Noggle</b> will talk in Maddox Theatre about how these women from the turn of the
century succeeded in the field of photography.

<blockquote>
My Australian experience was like a dream come true. It was everything I 
expected and more! From the red deserts and mystical rainforests to the white
beaches and amazing coral reefs, there is so much to see and explore. The

Incas and Spanish colonists, excursions to the Galapagos Islands, Inca ruins,

<h3>A world of opportunities . . .</h3>

<p>Welcome to an experience that literally will change your
outlook on life. A recent study on higher education reports that employers
expect college graduates to have international knowledge and language skills.</p>

<p>The international programs available through Rockford College
provide the tools you need to compete in a multicultural society.
Not only do you learn more about yourself and your culture but
you also enhance your resume and have fun while studying in
another country. From Greece to Japan, from a few weeks to a
semester or academic year, various programs are available and can
be tailored to meet your specific needs.</p>

<p>With recent changes in financial aid regulations,
international study has become affordable for everyone through a
variety of state and federal aid programs. Rockford College is
committed to the value of a liberal arts education by providing
countless opportunities for you to study in Europe, Latin
American, and Asia.</p>

<p>Through international study experience you will gain a deeper
respect for another culture, a better insight into your own culture,
a greater understanding of yourself, and practical international
experience for your career.</p>

<p>Many Rockford College students have studied in our own program

<P>                              
As part of the Rockford College experience, students are
encouraged to take an active role in campus life.  Participating
in the activities of clubs & organizations is one avenue for
involvement in our college community.  Clubs & organizations
offer opportunities to participate in activities which educate
and entertain, to meet students with common interests and
aspirations, to develop ties within a new community, to utilize
talents and to hone or develop marketable leadership skills.

<P>
At Rockford College, there are numerous clubs & organizations
available.  Depending on schedules and interest, students chose
to support the efforts of these clubs & organizations by
attending scheduled events, to contribute to specific clubs &
organizations by becoming active members or to take on leadership
positions within particular clubs & organizations.

<H1>Rockford College and Community Service</H1>
</CENTER>


<H3>A History of Reaching Out</H3>

<CENTER>

"...that the things which make men alike are finer and better
than the things that keep them apart, and that these basic
likenesses, if they are properly accentuated, easily transcend
the less essential differences of race, language, creed and
tradition."
<BR> 
Jane Addams<BR>
Rockford College Class of 1881
</CENTER>

<P>
Throughout our nearly 150-year history at Rockford College,
students have served their community--beginning with the Civil
War when students rolled bandages under Anna Peck Sill's watchful
gaze.  

<P>
Jane Addams is perhaps the best symbol of the service spirit of
Rockford College, founding Hull House in Chicago and helping
thousands of poor and immigrants better their lives through
cultural events, education, and ground-breaking labor and
sanitation laws.  For her efforts she received the Nobel Peace
Prize, becoming the first American woman to be honored with the
award.

<P>
Service continues to be a strong tradition here; students become
alumni who continue to work for the improvement of their
communities.  We learn from and teach each other when we
volunteer.

<P>  
Rockford College students are volunteering now in ever-increasing
numbers, building houses during Spring Break or getting up long
before their classes to serve breakfast at the Metro Christian
soup kitchen.  The prevailing attitude on campus today is one of
not just helping others but one of learning from the experience.

<CENTER>
<H3>Office of Community Service</H3>    
</CENTER>

<P>
Rockford College established the Office of Community Service in
August, 1995.  As a sign of Rockford College's on going
commitment to the community, and in response to the growth in
student interest in community service, the Office serves as a
clearing-house for service opportunities, community contacts and
student organization activities.

<P>
We encourage students to become involved by meeting community
needs through the utilization of their skills.  Whether you are
definite about your career plans or are still undecided about
your major, volunteering can provide experiences that will help
you with goal clarification, improve your organizational and
communication skills and reinforce your course knowledge through
direct application.  Working with the community can give you a
new perspective on your own life and help you gain valuable human
relations skills.  More importantly, however, the Rockford
community has a wide range of needs.  Skills that seem natural to
you can provide community organizations with valuable help in
transforming their community into a better place to live.

<H3>Time Commitment</H3>

<P>
How much time is needed to volunteer?  The idea of to little time
to make a difference is a fallacy.  Whether you have two hours a
week or a whole day to volunteer, you can make a difference. 
Dedication and follow-through, not time, is important. 
Regardless of the amount of time you have to offer, on going or
one time event, there is an opportunity waiting for you.

<H3>Volunteer in Areas of Interest</H3>

<P>
Youth:
<BR>
<P>
Volunteers interested in helping area youth may choose from a
variety of options.  Opportunities include becoming a big brother
or big sister, helping to organize and coach sporting events,
story reading, mentoring, or offering a listening hear to area
youth at risk.

<P>
Hunger and Homelessness:
<BR>
<P>
Hunger and Homelessness is committed to addressing homelessness
issues in the Rockford community.   Interested volunteers may
choose between working at one of the various shelters, food
pantries, or soup kitchens, or help local organizations supply
affordable housing through rehab and construction.  

<P>
Health Care:
<BR>
<P>
Volunteers may help in community hospitals, nursing homes,
hospices, or community health education programs.

<P>
Education:
<BR>
<P>
Tutoring offers volunteers the chance to share their knowledge
with children and adults of all ages in the Rockford community. 
Tutoring takes place in a classroom or on an individual basis
during the day, after school, or on weekends.  The number of
hours and times are flexible.  The choice is up to you!   

<P>
Crisis Intervention:
<BR>
<P>  
Interested volunteers may work on local hotlines providing
counseling and support for battered women, rape victims, runaway
youth and others who find themselves facing a crisis situation.  

<P>
For more information regarding the above, or to receive a list of
many more opportunities and areas of interest, contact Steve
Marcon, Director of Community Service, at 226-4161 or stop by to
see him in Student Services.

<CENTER>
<H3>Community-Based Learning</H3>

<!-- link from Academics if community-based learning is included in that area-->
     
</CENTER>

<P>
Community-based learning is used by a number of faculty in their
courses at Rockford College.  More and more of our professors are
seeing the value of community-based learning as an important tool
to supplement the usual classroom activities of reading, research
and discussion.  Students in their classes are experiencing
hands-on learning by working in the community as an elected or
required part of the course.  Sites have included medical
centers, homeless shelters, political offices and retirement
centers.  Rockford College students have been generally favorable
in their written and oral evaluations of community-based
learning.  Despite the fact that community-based learning may
involve extra hours and scheduling challenges, most students
report that their on-site work significantly improves their
knowledge of the course material.

<P>
For more information on community-based learning opportunities,
contact Rufus Cadigan, Faculty Coordinator for Community-Based
Learning, at 226-3381 or stop by to see him in Student Services.

</CENTER>

<P>
Established more than 25 years ago, Volunteer Service Corps (VSC)
is a student organization on campus open to all who have a strong
ongoing interest in volunteering.  VSC meets weekly to help
coordinate student efforts.  For more information, contact
Francine Pelayo, VSC President, by leaving a note in the VSC mail

<H1>Campus Ministry: Spiritual Life</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
Spiritual life has been at the foundation of Rockford College
since its founding as a female seminary in 1847.  Aside from
regular services that address the spiritual needs of the campus,
traditional interfaith services celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas
and Baccalaureate.

<P>
The spiritual programming at Rockford College is "student-driven
and needs based".  The Interfaith Council, comprised of students,
faculty and staff, meets regularly to address the spiritual needs
of the college community through its programming of special
events, Christian concerts, speakers, and retreats.

<P>
Fisher Chapel, the home of the campus based worship services, is
an interfaith space that is open daily.  It provides a quiet
oasis with music, candles and comforting atmosphere amid the
hectic campus activities.

<P>
Students are invited to participate in the weekly meetings and
special events of the student club, BASIC (Brothers and Sisters
in Christ).

<H3>Catholic Campus Ministry</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
For more than 25 years the Diocese of Rockford has placed a
Catholic Campus Minister at Rockford College.  While
approximately 35% of Rockford College is Catholic, Catholic
Campus Ministry provides service to all students regardless of
their faith tradition.

<P>
Catholic Campus Ministry is well known for its Mass and
Pizza nights.  Sunday evening mass is often followed by pizza and
conversation for all those who wish to "come for the prayer and
stay for the pizza".  Catholic students and their non-Catholic
friends are frequently found together at mass.  

<P>
On campus, the Catholic Campus Ministry is also well known for
its annual "Giving Tree".  Each year the students, faculty and
staff become Santa's elves gathering more than 200 Christmas
gifts for needy children in the Rockford community.

<H1>Lang Counseling Services</H1>
</CENTER>

<H3>Lang Counseling Mission Statement</H3>
<P>
The counseling service provides individual and relationship
counseling to the students, staff and faculty.  The Rockford
College community will find a confidential and safe environment
where individuals who are experiencing stress due to personal
problems,decision-making, or conflicts that seriously affect
their academic or personal goals can seek professional
assistance.

<H3>Who are the professional counselors at Lang?</H3>
<P>
Therese Grumley, MA, Director of Lang Services, received her MA
from Holy Names College in Oakland, California.  She has ten
years of diverse counseling experience with individuals,
families,and children.  Therese has worked extensively with
women's support groups and teen self-esteem groups.

<P>
Sallyann Roberts, Director of Counseling Services, received her
MSW from Washington University, St. Louis.  Sally has a broad
range of experience in clinical practice including, sexual
abuse/assault, relationship issues, eating disorders,  addictive
systems, and women's and men's issues.  Sally's special areas of
interest include dream and bereavement groups.

<H3>Who are the peer counselors and what do they do at Rockford
College?</H3>

<P>
Peer Counselors are Rockford College students who are hired to
offer educational programs to students in clubs, halls, wellness
classes, and during special programs such as National Collegiate
Alcohol Awareness Week.  Peers also meet with individual students
who are needing to talk with someone about a personal or
college-related issue.  Peers are trained throughout the year in
listening skills, conflict resolution, and communication.  Peers
are supervised by the professional staff.

<H3>What is the "Safe Place"?</H3>
<P>
The "Safe Place" is a group meeting room, quiet place and
resource library located at Lang Center that is available during
office hours, Monday - Friday.  Resources include books, tapes,
videos on topics such as stress, STD's and AIDS, depression,
alcohol and drug use, eating issues, relationships, sexual
assault, and more.  Students are welcome to come and browse or to
stay awhile to study or relax.

<H3>When is it time to ask for help?</H3>
<P>
Crisis can occur in ways that interfere with personal and/or
academic needs and goals.  Sometimes a specific problem is just
too much to handle alone and when this is the case, counseling
can offer assistance.  Counseling can also provide an opportunity
for growth in relationships, communication
skills, and emotional development.

<P>
When a problem is too much to handle alone, people experience
such symptoms as:

<H3>How do I make an appointment?</H3>
<P>
All appointments are made with an individual professional
counselor or peer counselor, depending on your preference.  Call
Lang Center at 815-226-4083 to speak directly to an available
counselor for an initial session so that an effective plan can be
determined. 

<H3>Lang Counseling Hours</H3>
<P>
Monday - Thursday 9 a.m.- 5 p.m.<br>
Friday 9 a.m. - 3 p.m.<br>

<H3>Confidentiality</H3>
<P>

to divulge any information unless you have signed a release
giving us permission to share such information.  However,
confidentiality is waived when danger to self or others (i.e.
suicide or homicide) is a concern.  Also, by law, we must report
suspected child abuse and/or neglect communicated to us by you.

some of the key concepts and approaches used by sociologists
in studying deviance; 2) to acquaint students with some of the
major research findings re: varieties of social phenomena
identified by American society as deviant; and 3) to provide

achieving peace, justice, and security--personally, socially,

<b> 
 Computers and computer technology are changing the world as we know it, and the rapid development of this field 
shows no signs of slowing. Hardware technology is expanding in power and speed while contracting in size and price.Computer scientists must harness this technology and channel its use for the good of mankind. 
 
Early computer scientists were trained merely as programmers.  With the nineties, however, a new generation of 
computer scientists has emerged. Today, these individuals are educated not only in the mechanics and technology 
of the computer and its programs but also in the possibilities of applying computers to solving new and more 
challenging problems.  
 
The computer scientist of today and tomorrow is a problem-solver who has a broad educational background in 
human needs and drives. The computer scientist understands the various possibilities for applications of computers 
to life, and frequently acts as a communication link between man and machine. To help students gain that 
understanding, we arrange and supervise internships with a wide variety of businesses and organizations. 
 
The Department of Computer Science offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, with a choice of 
Management Information Systems or Mathematics/Computer Science options under either degree.

<A name="overview"></a>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
When students study accounting, they gain an appreciation of the role that
individuals,
groups, institutions, and the application of financial data play in determining
how
businesses in the U.S. economy are operated and controlled. Students also will
deal with
a broad spectrum of ideas presented by faculty members who have a wide variety
of
academic and professional experience and a commitment to preparing the student
for the
changing world of the future.<P>

The accounting major is firmly anchored in the liberal arts to give students an
interdisciplinary perspective on the interrelationships between courses in the
major and
those in the social sciences, natural and physical sciences, and arts and
humanities. This
structure helps students develop the abilities to think and evaluate critically,
to
communicate clearly and forcefully with both the written and spoken word, and to
understand the process and role of decision making in the real world business
environment. <P>

Students will enjoy small classes that allows interaction with professors and
peers as
they progress. The department encourages students to take an academic internship
to
blend knowledge gained in the classroom with practical considerations of the
business
environment and to ease transitions to first jobs if students do not plan to
attend
graduate school.
<P>
Students should make every effort to obtain a broad international/intercultural
and/or
quantitative focus. Developing language skills by completing a two-year program
in one of
the modern languages will broaden student perspectives. In addition, students
would be
wise to complete as much work as possible in mathematics, statistics, and
computer science,
and apply these concepts within the major. The quantitative studies are
essential if
students want to go to graduate school.
<P>
Students also may gain valuable exposure to the international environment by
spending
a semester at Regent's College in London or by participating during their
sophomore years
in other international programs offered by Rockford College.
<P>
The Senior Seminar is a capstone course that integrates the variety of
information and
skills acquired from study in students' majors and related business areas with
the broad
scope of material in the rest of the academic program and provides an
appreciation of and
preparation for the experience of lifelong learning.

<P>
<a name="career"></a>
<h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
<p>Accounting majors have a wide variety of career choices, including public
accounting with
national, regional, or local accounting firms, corporate accounting, and
government
accounting. Students from Rockford College have done exceptionally well when
taking the
CPA exam.

<H3>Overview</H3>
<PRE>
  Anthropology and sociology illuminate the human experience.
They invite us to examine aspects of the social environment that
we often ignore, neglect, or take for granted. Through these
studies, we can achieve a better grasp of how society is
organized, where power lies, what beliefs channel our behavior,
and how societies come to be what they are. Anthropology and
sociology equip us with a special form of consciousness which
gives us a better understanding of the social and cultural
forces we confront, especially those that constrain us and free
us. Thus, both disciplines are liberating sciences.
  By looking at social and cultural arrangements in imaginative
and fresh ways, we gain a new vision of the social experience.
We find that the society into which we are born and the culture
transmitted to us shape ouridentities, personalities, emotions,
thought processes, and fortunes in countless ways. The challenge
of anthropology and sociology is to go beyond appearances and
peer behind the masks that people and organizations wear.
  As majors in anthropology and sociology at Rockford College,
students may pursue a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science
degree and choose from a number of concentrations: anthropology
and sociology, criminal justice, pre-social work, human
relations, and urban studies. In each area, the all-college and
divisional requirements ensure a strong liberal arts foundation
for a more specialized program of study. Students may have a
wide range of academic internship opportunities to work for a
semester in an agency or organization in the community and earn
credits toward graduation.
  Regent's College in London provides many opportunities to
expand students' social and cultural horizons and enrich their
knowledge of social science during their junior or senior years.
For qualified anthropology students, independent studies and
internships can be arranged at such distinguished organizations
as the Royal Anthropological Institute, The Museum of Man, and
the British Museum. For sociology students, courses at the
London School of Economics, independent studies of the British
health service, the British system of social service, the
British criminal justice system, Parliament, or other British
institutions can be arranged. We encourage students to take
advantage of this unique opportunity Rockford College offers.

<H3>Career opportunities</H3>
<PRE>
  Both anthropology and sociology are popular majors and minors
for students planning futures in such professions as law,
politics, social work, public health, urban planning, community
relations, and public administration, not to mention medicine
and divinity school. Students also will find that numerous
courses in criminal justice, management, marketing, business
organization, labor relations, communication, journalism,
recreation, and nursing draw upon the principles, research
techniques, and findings of both sociology and anthropology. 
  Employers frequently look for potential employees with specific
skills that are acquired in anthropology and sociology courses
dealing with survey and research methods, statistics, population
research, and urban studies. With a number of these courses to
their credit, students may well find themselves at a competitive
advantagedevelop interpersonal, analytical, problem-solving, and
communication skills essential for success in today's
competitive job market. According to the Wall Street Journal,
big employers are wooing social science and liberal arts
graduates with growing fervor after years of favoring job
applicants with technical degrees. Employers find that graduates
of schools like Rockford College can take a variety of problems
and apply creative analysis to them.

<A NAME="require"></A>
<H3>Degree requirements</H3>
<PRE>
  In order to be accepted as majors in the Department of
Anthropology and Sociology, students must have completed at

students must have achieved, and must subsequently maintain, a
grade point average of at least 2.25 for all courses attempted
at the college and a grade point average of at least 2.50 for
all courses attempted in the major.  Students whose cumulative

<H3>Overview</H3>

<PRE>
The Art Department addresses a component of human nature that is more 
accessible through sensory experiences than through other, more obviously 
academic means. This component is a necessary addition to the more 
customary verbal learning of the liberal arts education if students are to 
realize their full potential.

The art curriculum has two components: It presents the study of art in a 
philosophic and historic context; and it emphasizes the studio experience, 
in which students learn through exploration of various media to reconcile 
an idea with its visualization. Artistic training is a revelation of
personal insight through its capacity to bring intuitive knowledge to a
surface level.  The Art Department endeavors to meet the individual,
expressive, and technical needs of students.

Because art draws its vitality from the culture that spawns it, it is
significant that art is taught at Rockford College in a liberal arts
context to strengthen artistic insight through all the components of being
a fully and broadly educated individual. The art program balances a
diversity of studio experiences with intensive study in an area of
concentration, built on a foundation of perceptual training, critical
thinking, and a thorough understanding of the history of visual ideas.
</PRE>

<A NAME="career"></A>
<H3>Career Opportunities</H3>

<PRE>
A degree in art or art history from Rockford College is excellent 
preparation to be an artist or a teacher or for going on to graduate 
school for further fine art, art history, or commercial art training. 
</PRE>

<A NAME="require"></A>
<H3>Degree Requirements</H3>

<PRE>
The Department of Art offers Bachelor of Arts degrees in art and 
art history and the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree with concentrations  
in drawing, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture and ceramics. 
Teaching in the studio areas of art is adapted to individual needs and 
abilities. If students want to take studio art courses for graduate credit, 
they must obtain written permission from the art faculty before registering. 
An evaluation of the students creative work will be required before

<A NAME="overview"></A>
<h3>Overview</h3>

As the &quot;central science,&quot; chemistry is rooted 
in mathematics and physics, yet has applications in
biology,medicine, and environmental science. Since all substances are 
chemicals, an understanding of chemistry is vital not only to scientists 
but also to all who would make decisions in their personal 
lives as to health, lifestyle, and choice of material things, 
and in their public lives as to issues such as clean air and water, 
nuclear power, and solid waste disposal and recycling.
The Department of Chemistry offers both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor 
of Science degrees and a chemistry minor through a traditional curriculum. 
Prospective majors should begin their study of chemistry and mathematics 
in their freshman year; physical chemistry should be completed by the end 
of their junior year.  Emphasis on laboratory work makes real the words that 
both text and lecture convey, while teaching basic laboratory skills and 
introducing students to modern instrumentation and scientific computer 
software. All majors are required to take one semester of undergraduate 
research, working with a faculty member on projects that can easily be 
continued for another semester or two. Although students getting a B.A. 
degree may fulfill the language requirement with German, French, Spanish, 
Latin, or Greek, those who intend to pursue and advanced degree in chemistry 
are encouraged to take German or French.
Beyond the traditional course work, chemistry students at Rockford College 
can explore internships, special courses, research opportunities and 
study abroad. Those interested in medicine may get clinical experience 
at local hospitals and may observe surgery as early as their sophomore 
year. Internships are available at local industries, and secondary teaching 
field experience at local high schools is offered. Students interested in 
overseas experience can spend a semester (preferably in their junior year) 
at Regent's College in London; courses in other fields can possibly be 
coupled with an internship at Lilly Research Centre in
Surrey. The Chemistry Department also offers several courses designed 
for the non-science major. Current courses include Understanding the 
Nuclear Age, Chemistry in Our Environment, and Aspects of Inorganic, 
Organic and Biochemistry. Not only will these provide a foundation for 
making informed decisions relating to current societal issues, but they 
may also enhance majors such as business, education, psychology, political 
science, and the allied healths.


<A NAME = "career"></a><h3>Career opportunities</h3>

Many Rockford College chemistry majors have gone on to graduate schools 
and earned advanced degrees, usually with full financial support. 
Others have gone on to become doctors, dentists, veterinarians, 
medical technologists,or pharmacists. Still others have gone directly 
into industry or have become teachers through our State of Illinois-approved 
program for chemistry teachers. Some students have combined a chemistry 
major with business or foreign language to prepare for careers in 
science-related business or industry.



<A NAME = "require"></a><h3>Degree requirements</h3>

The B.A. Program (28 hours) is intended for those who do not plan to 
work as industrialchemists or go to graduate school, e.g.,high school 
chemistry teachers who need 32 hours, pre-professional majors

<A NAME="overview"></A>
<h3>Overview</h3><br>
<pre>
The Classics including Greek and Latin studies historically have been
at the heart of the liberal arts. Acquaintance with the cultures and beliefs
of the ancients often gives us useful background and insights into current
events. Besides providing a foundation in the cultures on which our present
civilization has been built and a broad and firm base for continued learning,
many Classics courses improve communication skills. Classics courses often 
attract students with strong interests in sciences, arts, 
social studies or humanities.
<P>
To complement classroom studies, more than 180 speakers have been
brought to Rockford College from all parts of the United States and 
abroad to lecture about various world cultures under sponsorship of 
the Classics department, the campus chapter of Eta Sigma Phi 
(the national Classics honorary society), and the Rockford Society of the 
Archaeological Institute of America (AIA).
</P>
Classics courses combine well with majors in English, art, modern 
foreign languages, history, political science, philosophy, theatre, 
and other areas. For Classics students who would like to study abroad, 
Regent's College in London offers opportunities to visit famous 
archaeological sites of the ancient world and some of the world's 
greatest museums of antiquities. Other opportunities are available 
for foreign study in schools in Rome and Athens.
<P>
The Department of Classics offers the Bachelor of Arts degree with 
majors available in Latin or Classics and minors in Latin, Greek, or 
Classical Civilization. Students may apply for the Mary Braginton Scholarship
in Latin. Good students in Latin or Greek may be elected to Eta Sigma Phi.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="career"></A>
<h3>Career opportunities</h3>

The Classics major may lead to positions in high school and college 
teaching, with openings also available in museum, archive, publishing 
or library work. A Classics background also is helpful preparation for 
professional programs such as medicine, pharmacy, law, divinity, 
archaeology, and modern languages.

<H3>Overview</H3>


 Computers and computer technology are changing the world as we know it, and the rapid development of this field
shows no signs of slowing. Hardware technology is expanding in power and speed while contracting in size and price.
Computer scientists must harness this technology and channel its use for the good of mankind.<BR>

Early computer scientists were trained merely as programmers.  With the nineties, however, a new generation of
computer scientists has emerged. Today, these individuals are educated not only in the mechanics and technology
of the computer and its programs but also in the possibilities of applying computers to solving new and more
challenging problems.<BR> 

The computer scientist of today and tomorrow is a problem-solver who has a broad educational background in
human needs and drives. The computer scientist understands the various possibilities for applications of computers
to life, and frequently acts as a communication link between man and machine. To help students gain that
understanding, we arrange and supervise internships with a wide variety of businesses and organizations.<BR>

The Department of Computer Science offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, with a choice of
Management Information Systems or Mathematics/Computer Science options under either degree. <BR>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><br>
When students study Economics and Business Administration, they will gain a deeper appreciation 
of the roles that individuals, groups, and institutions play in determining the answers to basic 
questions within an economic system. In addition, they will be exposed to a broad spectrum of 
ideas by faculty members who bring a wide variety of academic and professional experience to the 
classroom. Students will also have the opportunity to take academic internships to blend the 
knowledge gained in the classroom with the practical considerations of an operating business. 

<P>The 
academic program gives students an interdisciplinary perspective on the interrelationships between 
courses in the major and in the social sciences, natural and physical sciences, and the arts and 
humanities. Because the Economics and Business Administration program is firmly anchored in the 
liberal arts, students develop the abilities to think and evaluate critically and to communicate clearly 
and forcefully with both the written and spoken word, and to understand the process and role of 
decision making in the real world business environment. 

<P>The Department of Economics and 
Business offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees with majors in Economics and 
Business Administration, and we recommend that students pursue a broad intercultural/international 
and/or quantitative focus in their studies. Students' long-term employment prospects will be 
enhanced by completing a two-year program in one of the modern languages. Students can gain 
valuable experience from an exposure to the international environment through a semester at 
Regent's College in London or other international programs. Students should complete this portion 
of their program before the second semester of their senior year, prior to taking the Senior Seminar. 

<P>Students also will be well served by completing as much work as possible in mathematics, statistics, 
and computers and by applying these concepts within their majors. The quantitative portion of the 
program is essential if the student plans to attend graduate school. All students majoring in Business 
or Economics are expected to demonstrate proficiency in at least two areas of computer software 
applications: spread sheets, database management, word processing and computer programming. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<a name="career"></a>
<h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
<p>As economics or business majors, students have a wide variety of career opportunities. Students in 
business often choose to concentrate in one of the functional areas of finance, marketing, or 
management, while economics majors may concentrate in the areas of public policy or international 
economics as they prepare for graduate school or entry into the work force. Careers in 
administration, banking, law, government, sales, public administration and with international agencies 
are among student options. <br>

<h3>Overview</h3>
All teacher education programs at Rockford College are firmly rooted in the liberal arts to provide a broad range of
knowledge and practical experiences that will help students understand themselves, society, the natural world, and the world
of arts and humanities.
<P>
Students learn how children and adolescents develop physically, socially and psychologically in the context of schools.
Students will understand how children and adolescents learn, know how to recognize and adjust for individual differences,
learn how to create a positive learning environment, and be able to evaluate their own teaching skills.
<P>
The programs culminate in the teaching semester, and acceptance is not automatic. Students must apply in the spring of their
junior year and show proof of at least 100 hours of work with children at the level at which they wish to student teach.
Students must have a minimum 2.50 grade point average in the major and overall. If either grade point average is between
2.25 and 2.5, students may petition the Application Committee for a special review. Students accepted for the teaching
semester are notified by April of their junior year.<P>

The Department of Education and Child Development offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in Child
Development/Elementary Education. The department also offers a minor in secondary education for majors in Art, Biology,
Chemistry, English, French, German, History, Mathematics, Physical Education, Social Science, Spanish, and Theatre Arts. 
Learning Disabilities Qualification is available at the undergraduate level for those pursuing a bachelor's degree with a major
or minor in education.

<H3>Overview</H3>
<PRE>
  Among the benefits of studying English language and literature
are a deeper appreciation of our own humanness and that of
others, a sharpened critical understanding of worthwhile ideas
and texts, and a regular confrontation with the blank page which
demands discipline of mind and adherence to convention as
students give shape to half-realized concepts in the act of
writing. 
  A major in English trains students to think analytically, to
write clearly and forcefully, and to sustain an argument
effectively all with an awareness of the values that gave form
to the great traditions in language and literature. At Rockford
College, those traditions are embodied in a curriculum
enthusiastically supported by a faculty that requires some sort
of expository and argumentative writing about the traditions in
all its literature courses.
  English majors here study with able classmates, are competitive
for scholarships specifically for English majors, choose from an
interesting array of academic internships in businesses and
corporations in Rockford and nearby communities, and have the
opportunity to study at Regent's College, in the center of
London. Rockford College maintains a fully accredited academic
program at Regent's, allowing students to study for a semester
or a year close to the libraries, museums, theaters, and
historic sites of one of the great cultural centers of the world.
  For students considering advanced study in English literature
following graduation from Rockford College, a semester or a year
in London has obvious advantages, but for those students whose
major in English is a preparation for some other kind of
professional career law or medicine or business, for example 
Regent's College also offers a variety of opportunities.
Students living in London may gain valuable experience by
observing the law courts or Parliament or visiting British
hospitals, and London offers unique advantages for English
majors with a professional eye toward business. Qualified,
well-prepared students may be able to arrange internships with
British or international corporations.
  The Department of English regards study at Regent's as a
significant part of the departmental major program and as a
complement to courses taken on the Rockford campus. The faculty
of the English Department hope that seniors in English 495, most
of whom will bring to the class not only a common knowledge of
literature but also a common stock of experience acquired in the
very center of the English-speaking world, will find the seminar
an effective culmination of a course of humane study which
represents education in the liberal arts at its best.

<A NAME="career"></A>
<H3>Career opportunities</H3>
<PRE>
  For majors in English there are plentiful career opportunities
in teaching, librarianship, journalism, public relations,
advertising, business, industry, and government. Today, English
also provides valuable preparation for careers in law, medicine,
nursing, and any number of other graduate and professional 
schools. In fact, because it trains the student to think clearly
and write effectively, English is one of the best pre-professional
majors.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><br>
The Department of Modern Languages at Rockford College is committed to the
principle of proficiency as its orientation on teaching and learning a language.
That means we teach all our courses in the target language, and we encourage
students to study overseas for a semester or a year. We provide a variety of
out-of-class opportunities for students to practice using language in a range of
contexts likely to be encountered in the target culture. Graduates of our
language programs reach a level of proficiency in the language that allows them
to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on
practical, social, and professional topics.<P>

Our students also learn more than how to communicate effectively in another
language. From the language and through the language, they learn the way of
thinking of a different people, the way of being of a different culture.  This
kind of growing and liberating experience is in the best tradition of the liberal
arts. Finally, our students acquire the global perspective that is so very much
valued today in the professional world.
<P>
The Department of Modern Languages offers Bachelor of Arts degrees in French,
German, and Spanish.  <P>
A placement exam is required for registration for all courses for students who
have studied at least two years of French, German, or Spanish in high school.
<A NAME="career"></A>
<H3>Career opportunities</H3>

In addition to preparing students for teaching or graduate school, the B.A.
degree in French provides a valuable tool for many careers in the fields of
publishing and editing, travel and tourism, business and banking, library work,
etc. It is an excellent second area of specialization that combines with other
disciplines such as history, mathematics, economics, business administration,
art, etc.

All levels of teaching in the United States and in German-speaking countries are
open to German graduates. The list of non-teaching positions is expanding and
includes business positions, work with service agencies such as tourism and
banking, and a variety of government jobs.  We recommend German as a minor or
double major in combination with majors in biology, chemistry, mathematics,
history, theatre, art and business.

The B.A. program in Spanish, in addition to preparing students for teaching or
graduate school, gives students a useful and valuable tool for a large number of
careers, especially for those in which contact with Spanish-speaking peoples is
likely, such as in education, public and social services, health services, law,
recreation programs, the tourist industry, business and banking, government,
library work, publishing, etc. As a result, it is an excellent second area of
specialization that combines well with many other disciplines; a growing number
of students have chosen to major both in Spanish and another area (i.e., history,
sociology, business administration, child development, political science, etc.).

<H3>Overview</H3>
<PRE>
  The question is sometimes asked, "What can I do with a history
major?"  The answer is, "Whatever you want to do." The point is,
students should not choose to study history as a major or minor
because of any career interest (liberal education never has much
to do with specific careers), but rather because they like
history. The goal of the Rockford College History Department is
not to prepare students to earn a living, but to prepare
students to enjoy more fully the living they earn. 
</PRE>

<A NAME="career"></A>
<H3>Career opportunities</H3>
<PRE>
  Careers subsequently pursued by history majors at Rockford
College are as varied as can be imagined: archivist, college
professor, fry cook, human resources consultant, lawyer,
hairdresser, librarian, medical doctor, millionaire's spouse,
musician, poet, politician, preacher, social worker, soldier,
teacher, used car salesman. These examples and more can be
documented.
