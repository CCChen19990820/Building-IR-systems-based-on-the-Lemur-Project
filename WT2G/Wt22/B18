<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>
 Addressing you, soldiers of the Allied Armies, members of the
Czechoslovak units that fought abroad as well as of the domestic
Resistance, our foreign guests and my fellow citizens, I am proud
that today - fifty years after our country was freed from Nazi
rule - I can on behalf of the Czech Republic thank all those to
whom we owe the liberation.
<P>
 My thanks go to all the surviving men and women of many nationalities
who took part in the liberation struggles on both the eastern
and the western fronts. I thank them for having risked their lives
for the restoration of the democratic Czechoslovakia, for the
freedom of us all, for the victory of the human race over Nazi
violence.
<P>
 By the same token, my thanks go to all the surviving Czechs,
Slovaks and other Czechoslovak citizens, including those of German
birth, who joined foreign military forces to fight on the side
of the Allies for the liberation of their home country. Furthermore,
I thank all the surviving members of the domestic Resistance.
Acting for all their fellow citizens and in their name, they saved
the honour of our nation, and it was also due to the important
contribution which they made to the liberation struggle that our
state became a member of the victorious coalition.
<P>
 I bow in homage before the memory of the thousands of participants
in that great fight for the salvation of humanity who fell on
battlefields, were executed or tortured to death, or passed away
before they could see this commemoration day.
<P>
 The present generations owe a debt of gratitude to them all,
the living as well as those who are not with us any more, because
all of them stood up, with or without arms, to combat an evil
that sought to subjugate the entire civilized world.
<P>
 It was not their fault that the fight would not have taken such
a heavy toll if the international community had not made concessions
to Nazism for so long and had resisted it earlier. Nor was it
their fault that Stalin was no true military leader and that he
sacrificed on the eastern front uselessly and wantonly millions
of troops who could have survived had the operations been conducted
more skilfully. And it was not their fault either that the freedom
we finally won was half-baked and did not last. Soon after the
end of World War II our country was again subjected to a totalitarian
regime, this time to one of the Communist type, and more than
forty endless years had to pass before we succeeded in shaking
it off and became truly free.
<P>
 Today, we are commemorating V-E Day at a time when we are, at
last, genuinely free, in every way and, as I firmly believe, forever.
<P>
 Everyone who fought against Nazism as well as everyone who opposed
Communism made a contribution to this accomplishment, not only
in the form of the tangible results of their fight but also through
something that goes beyond that, something that cannot be confined
to the history books alone: the moral example which they set for
us and for our successors. It is first and foremost thanks to
all those who fought against evil in different periods of modern
history that we understand today better than ever before that
evil must be resisted consistently and from the very beginning,
and that there are moments when personal interests have to be
forgone for the sake of a brighter future of the community.
<P>
 If, as a nation, we want to have backbone, to preserve our honour
and to be able to respect ourselves, we must never forget the
heroism shown by our liberators as well as by our ancestors in
resisting violence. At the same time, however, our nation must
acknowledge the depth of the failure of those of its members,
many as they were, who remained passive in the face of evil or
even abetted it. We should never cease to feel shame at the indifference
with which a great part of our population stood by and watched
how disgracefully the Communist regime, in the name of us all
and of our country, treated the heros and the victims of World
War II. Those who did more than anyone else for our liberty were
among the first to be persecuted. This is what I consider one
of the biggest crimes of Communism, one through which Communism
most clearly revealed its true nature: the new oppressors, proceeding
to stifle freedom again, dealt first with those who had proved
that they treasured freedom before all else.
<P>
 Therefore, I avail myself of this moment of celebration to apologize
on behalf of our national community to all those who during World
War II saved its honour and helped restore its liberty for the
inaction toward the persecution which they suffered after the
war.
<P>
 The cringing caution which many of us were so good at showing
both after Munich and during the Nazi occupation and later under
Communism must never again be our national programme. We have
to build on something else: on love for freedom and justice, on
respect for human dignity, and on the ability to prove the validity
of these feelings, if need be, by concrete deeds. In other words,
the values which we need now are the very qualities which were
demonstrated by all the men and women to whom we give our thanks
today and whose memory we honour.
<P>
 One more thing has to be said today: while World War II ended
with a victory of the Allies over Germany, in the years that followed
Germany itself has accomplished a victory over Germany as the
new Germany triumphed over the old one. Today's Germany, having
dissociated itself long ago from its nationalist and expansionist
past, is an important component of the democratic and increasingly
united Europe, and has become the Germany which brave German antifascists
longed for. I therefore avail myself of this occasion also to
appeal to all my fellow citizens not to give in to the anti-German
sentiments which certain enemies of a peaceful and democratic
Europe would wish to foment, but to find in themselves the courage
to condemn as well all the injustices and cruelties which many
of us once perpetrated when taking revenge on Germans for the
pernicious work of Nazism.
<P>
 Nazism and Nazi Germany receded into the past long ago. What
has not receded and must never be allowed to recede is the valour
of the men and women who resisted Nazism and the memory of those
who on the various battlefields of World War II continued to fight
the battle which the human race has been waging since time immemorial
against the evil it breeds and to which it has so often succumbed.
<P>
World War II Veterans and Resistance Fighters,
<P>
 Never again shall we betray your legacy!

<P>
Your Majesty,
<P>
Mr. President of the Generalitat,
<P>
President von Weizs&auml;cker,
<P>
Mr. Porcel,
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>
 The fiftieth anniversary of the end of World War II has once
again made me think about the eventful modern history of my country.
Once again I came to the realization that the central motif of
this period is an everlasting theme, one in which I have always
taken a special interest, namely the relationship between morality
and politics. Thus, when Mr. Pujol asked me to say on this ceremonial
occasion a few words on this particular subject, I immediately
thought of taking this opportunity to look at it in the light
of the modern history of my country.
<P>
 During that period there were several crucial moments that put
before the representatives of our state the same agonizing dilemma:
whether to harm the nation by yielding to somebody's dictate or
by not yielding. They always opted for the former, and I have
always thought that choice a fatal error. I still think so, but
compared with the times when I was but an independent observer
of history, lacking the experience of how difficult decision-making
is for a person saddled with a political office and thus bearing
a direct responsibility for the fate of his or her fellow citizens
and their descendants, I now understand much better what kind
of a burden lay on the shoulders of those who were required to
take those historic decisions. I will admit that many times lately
I have tried to look at their situation the way they saw it, and
to imagine what I would have done in their place, asking myself
whether I would have been able to decide in favour of the alternative
which I deem to be the right one as easily as I advocated it before
I tasted myself the responsibilities of a political office.
<P>
 The first of such ominous dilemmas was faced by Czechoslovak
President Edvard Benes at the time of the Munich dictate. He knew
full well that he was confronted by the aggression of a madman,
sanctioned by our then allies who thus betrayed not only the treaties
they had signed but also the values they professed. He was aware
that from the viewpoint of national honour, and with a view to
preserving the moral integrity of our national community, the
right thing to do would have been not to give in to the dictate
and to proceed to defend the country. On the other hand, however,
he knew what that could have meant: thousands of lost lives, the
devastation of the country and the probability of an early military
defeat by a far stronger adversary. He realized that such a decision
would likely have met with lack of understanding, even rejection
on the part of the democratic world, and that he himself might
well have been branded as a peacebreaker and provocateur foolishly
attempting to draw other nations into a totally unnecessary war.
He decided to capitulate without fighting, because he thought
that course more responsible than risking capitulation preceded
by heavy losses.
<P>
 The same man found himself in a similar situation in February
1948. Then, he could have resisted the Communist putschists supported
not only by the powerful Soviet Union but also by a part of the
nation. He could have risked bloodshed which might have ended
with a victory of the Communists anyway. The other option was
to succumb, and thus pave the way for many years of Communist
totalitarian rule. At that time too, old, ailing and disappointed,
he chose capitulation.
<P>
 For a third time, Czechoslovak representatives capitulated after
the Soviet occupation of our country in 1968. Having been abducted
to the Soviet Union and exposed for several days to humiliation
and threats, all - with one laudable exception - signed the so-called
Moscow protocols, thus de facto legalizing the occupation and
taking the first, and essential, step toward the ensuing course
of events that was called, rather perversely, &quot;normalization&quot;.
<P>
 Any parallels between different historical situations may of
course be misleading. This is true of the cases I mention here
as well: different people, equipped with different experience
and acting in different circumstances, both international and
domestic, decided about considerably different matters. Whole
libraries of testimonies, memoirs and historical analyses now
exist on each of the three dilemmas, and whoever delves into them
realizes all too well how cheap it would be to simply equate those
three dark moments of our modern history.
<P>
 Nevertheless, we should not overlook certain general similarities
among them:
<P>
 1/ Those making the decisions did not know what we know today
about the consequences which their decisions would have or, more
generally, about the course which history would take afterwards.
They had only their own judgment to draw on, the depth of their
understanding of the given situation and their own imagination
as to what the consequences of their choice would be. They all
knew they were deciding between two evils, and they all tried
to weigh responsibly which of them was the lesser.
<P>
 2/ All three dilemmas had one thing in common. Those who were
thrown into them had to choose between an alternative that was
more moral, yet carried with it the risk of incalculable loss
of life and suffering, and one that was more realist and promised
not to entail so many direct losses. Actually, they were torn
between two dimensions of political responsibility - on the one
hand, responsibility for the moral integrity of the society; on
the other, responsibility for human lives. This must be a dreadful
dilemma, and someone who has never been confronted with it personally
can hardly pass judgment on it.
<P>
 3/ None of us knows, nor shall we ever know, what would have
happened had those who made the decisions in the three cases mentioned
here decided otherwise. History is characterized by what physicists
call singularity - it always takes one course only, with no alternatives
we could compare and no ifs. Therefore, we should be very careful
when judging past decisions, and avoid jumping to conclusions.
<P>
 4/ All the aforementioned decisions brought about similar consequences
- a far-reaching traumatization and long-term demoralization of
the society. We can even say that this is where we can perhaps
find a thread, thin as it may be, of a causal nexus between them.
The post-war situation in my country would probably not have been
as favourable to the Communist offensive to which the democrats
eventually yielded if it had not been for the trauma of Munich,
and the reform-minded Communists would hardly have given up so
easily in 1968 if it had not been for the easy victory of the
Communists in 1948. I do not think that the Czechs, or Czechs
and Slovaks, are worse than any other nation from the moral point
of view. I only believe that in the decades following the Munich
dictate of 1938 my country suffered a specific type of moral frustration,
and that the three political decisions I am discussing here were
to a substantial extent instrumental in its emergence and subsequent
deepening. Our democracy, or our longing for it, three times surrendered
without battle, and this has left deep scars upon the soul of
our society and adversely affected its development. I could give
you hundreds of concrete examples bearing this out, but that is
not the purpose of this speech.
<P>
 Its purpose is to demonstrate how problematic it is to set politics
and morality against one another. Didn't the &quot;less moral&quot;
decisions have thoroughly adverse effects in the political sense
as well? Didn't the moral traumas resulting from these decisions
have a deep and long-term political impact? We do not know what
the consequences would have been of decisions to the contrary
- the &quot;more moral&quot; ones. But we can well imagine that
in the latter case the effects might not have been so deep, so
long-lasting, or so fatal. Most likely, there would have been
heavier immediate losses to both human lives and property, and
greater immediate physical suffering. But wouldn't we have been
spared other losses, the less visible yet deeper and more durable
ones - the losses caused by the harm done to the moral integrity
of our national community? It surely is difficult to weigh different
types of losses against each other, to judge how many thwarted
human lives would still be a justifiable price for the long-term
sanity of the society and its long-term immunity against new evils,
or at which number would the price become too high. However, one
thing is certain: both morality and immorality have direct political
consequences, just as political decisions have a direct bearing
on morality. That is why I think that it is nonsense to separate
politics from morality, or to say that the two are totally unrelated.
Putting such thoughts into practice, or even just saying them,
is - paradoxically - not only deeply immoral, but very wrong politically
as well.
<P>
 Morality is omnipresent, and so is politics, and politics that
dissociates itself from morality is simply bad politics.
<P>
 But I have not yet answered the question of what I would have
done had I been in the place of my predecessors and faced the
dilemmas which they faced.
<P>
 I will admit that I don't know. I only think I would probably
have decided differently, while not ruling out the possibility
that this belief is influenced by the fact that I know what they
did not: the consequences resulting from their decisions.
<P>
 Thus, it appears more relevant to ask myself another question:
what would I do if I found myself confronted today with a dilemma
similar to those which they had to deal with, not knowing and
not being able to know - just as they didn't - what the ultimate
impact of my decision would be.
<P>
 I believe I would try to judge objectively all the relevant aspects,
consult with many people who have my full confidence, analyze
the whole situation and attempt to make a rational estimate of
the different consequences that my action could possibly have.
And when, having done all that, I still would not know what to
do, I would probably turn to an authority which, while it may
not be wholly reliable in the strict sense of the word, has more
than once proved to be the most reliable source to me: my conscience,
my moral instincts, that part in me which - as I see it - transcends
me.
<P>
 We all know what qualms of conscience are, the strange and dejecting
feeling that we have betrayed something in us, or something above
us, that we have sunk into a mire, or soiled ourselves with some
ugly dirt, the feeling of having done something which we must
constantly justify before someone near us, something in us or
someone above us, while suspecting that the more we seek such
justification the less convinced we shall be in our own mind that
what we did was truly right. This is a state of deep existential
distress, a contact with what some philosophers call nothingness.
On the other hand, we all know the uplifting state of mind that
comes from having decided to do something that does not bring
us any visible benefits, but of which we can be certain that it
satisfies the requirements we are called upon to meet, through
our conscience, by what is called the moral order of the world.
<P>
 I do not know whether these thoughts will win the applause of
politicians. But I can't help it: nothing has convinced me so
far that doing what our heart tells us to do is not the best politics
of all.
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>
 I thank you for the attention with which you have listened to
these remarks. Most of all, I thank Catalonia for the prize it
has awarded me today. I am happy to receive it together with a
man whom I hold in the highest esteem.

<P>
Your Holiness,
<P>
Millions of my fellow citizens join me in rejoicing as I welcome
you again on the soil of the Czech Republic. It is with emotion
that I think at this moment of your visit here in April 1990,
remembering its unforgettable atmosphere and its extraordinary
significance to our national community. To all of us, your first
visit was a great feast of spiritual freedom, making us keenly
aware of the opening of a door that had so long been closed to
us.
<P>
Many things have happened since then in this country and worldwide.
It is gratifying to look back at what we have accomplished. Civil
liberties and democratic institutions have been restored here,
and the nation's economy has been put on a new footing. Yet, if
these fundamental changes are to be truly valid, a spiritual and
moral regeneration of the society must proceed along with them.
I would, in fact, go so far as to say that they would have no
chance of a lasting success otherwise.
<P>
In the realm of mentality, changes are often rather slow to come,
or difficult to achieve. Eradicating the spiritual and moral distortions
caused by the totalitarian regime takes a great deal more effort
than, for example, replacing bad legislation. The mental state
of the society is namely the result of an endless series of struggles
which everyone has to wage within themselves.
<P>
The social climate during your present visit differs from that
of 1990. The enthusiasm we felt then about our newly gained freedom
has given way to more sober thinking about everyday life with
its everyday cares. It may well be that, at this time, meeting
you and all that you stand for is even more important, more relevant
to the needs of the day. Before, we struggled with something outside
us. Now, we have to turn to our hearts if we want to live up to
the values which we put on our banners several years ago. Before,
we laid the political and economic foundations of a free society.
Now, we need to focus on the deeper preconditions of freedom,
on the &quot;ecology of freedom&quot;, the &quot;human ecology&quot;
and the &quot;social ecology&quot; on which you have placed so
much emphasis in your Encyclicals and statements.
<P>
The Catholic Church has been playing its spiritual role for nearly
two thousand years. It is with profound respect that we acknowledge
the significance of its work, its natural authority and its historical
experience, listening carefully to its words - often your own
words - through which it enhances our commitment to morality.
<P>
The Czech nation adopted Christianity at the very dawn of its
history, and is proud to have been part of the Christian civilization
ever since. It has embraced both a Catholic heritage and a notable
tradition of the Reformation. A prominent place in our spiritual
history belongs to John Hus, for whom Your Holiness has found
words of appreciation, thus encouraging efforts by Czech Catholics
to form a new, more sympathetic attitude toward his personality
and his legacy. I should like to express my hope that the understanding
among Christians of different denominations will continue to grow
in future and that they shall work in unison for a common goal.
Your Holiness personally has done an immense service to such understanding,
and the Czechs very much appreciate that.
<P>
I am confident that in the environment of our new democracy, which
has fully restored religious freedoms, Christian Churches will
make a major contribution to the spiritual rebirth of our society.
The Catholic Church, with many more members and a much wider background
in this territory than other Churches, has a heightened responsibility.
While those who openly declare themselves Roman Catholics constitute
about one fifth of this country's population, the cultural influence
of the Church undoubtedly extends wider.
<P>
Just as Christianity, and the Catholic Church as part of it, were
an important component of our nation's life in the more distant
past and, despite all the disfavour of the then self-appointed
rulers, in the more recent history as well, they shall retain
that position in future too. The great spiritual and moral authority
of the Catholic Church should remain forever present in the life
of our national community. I trust that it shall sensitively respond
to the needs and feelings of the people living in our time and
in this area, bringing us closer to one another and fostering
our spiritual links with our neighbours in Europe and all people
of good will on this planet.
<P>
Your Holiness,
<P>
The canonization of Agnes of Bohemia in Rome in 1989 and its celebration
in Prague were a remarkable source of strength not only for Czech
believers but for the whole nation. They thus became an inseparable
component of the events of November 1989, undoubtedly instilling
into that dramatic process of social change elements that helped
accomplish it peacefully and with dignity. Such harmony of developments
and human desires is certainly a rare and precious gift. It is
my conviction that with your present visit, which is a very special
occasion for this country, we are given such a gift again.
<P>
Holy Father, I thank you for being in our midst for a second time.
You carry the message of the Gospel as well as of the Ten Commandments.
I trust that you will remind us all of their words which remain
valid forever.
<P>
Welcome to our country!

<P>
        Mr. President,<BR>
        Mr. VicePresident,<BR>
        Ladies and gentlemen,<BR>

<P>
        One evening not long ago I was sitting in an outdoor restaurant
by the water. My chair was almost identical to the chairs they
have in restaurants by the Vltava River in Prague. They were playing
the same rock music they play in most Czech restaurants. I saw
advertisements I'm familiar with back home. Above all, I was surrounded
by young people who were similarly dressed, who drank familiarlooking
drinks, and who behaved as casually as their contemporaries in
Prague. Only their complexion and their facial features were different
&Auml; for I was in Singapore.<BR>
        <BR>
        I sat there thinking about this and again - for the umpteenth
time &Auml; I realized an almost banal truth: that we now live
in a single global civilization. The identity of this civilization
does not lie merely in similar forms of dress, or similar drinks,
or in the constant buzz of the same commercial music all around
the world, or even in international advertising. It lies in something
deeper: thanks to the modern idea of constant progress, with its
inherent expansionism, and to the rapid evolution of science that
comes directly from it, our planet has, for the first time in
the long history of the human race, been covered in the space
of a very few decades by a single civilization &Auml; one that
is essentially technological. The world is now enmeshed in webs
of telecommunication networks consisting of millions of tiny threads
or capillaries that not only transmit information of all kinds
at lightning speed, but also convey integrated models of social,
political and economic behaviour. They are conduits for legal
norms, as well as for billions and billions of dollars crisscrossing
the world while remaining invisible even to those who deal directly
with them. The life of the human race is completely interconnected
not only in the informational sense, but in the causal sense as
well. Anecdotically, I could illustrate this by reminding you
&Auml; since I've already mentioned Singapore &Auml; that today
all it takes is a single shady transaction initiated by a single
devious bank clerk in Singapore to bring down a bank on the other
side of the world. Thanks to the accomplishments of this civilization,
practically all of us know what cheques, bonds, bills of exchange,
and stocks are. We are familiar with CNN and Chernobyl, and we
know who the Rolling Stones, or Nelson Mandela, or Salman Rushdie
are. More than that, the capillaries that have so radically integrated
this civilization also convey information about certain modes
of human co-existence that have proven their worth, like democracy,
respect for human rights, the rule of law, the laws of the marketplace.
Such information flows around the world and, in varying degrees,
takes root in different places.<BR>
        <BR>
        In modern times this global civilization emerged in the
territory occupied by European and ultimately by EuroAmerican
culture. Historically, it evolved from a combination of traditions
&Auml; classical, Judaic and Christian. In theory, at least, it
gives people not only the capacity for worldwide communication,
but also a coordinated means of defending themselves against many
common dangers. It can also, in an unprecedented way, make our
life on this earth easier and open up to us hitherto unexplored
horizons in our knowledge of ourselves and the world we live in.
<BR>
        <BR>
        And yet there is something not quite right about it.<BR>
        <BR>
        Allow me to use this ceremonial gathering for a brief
meditation on a subject which I have dwelt upon a great deal,
and which I often bring up on occasions resembling this one. I
want to focus today on the source of the dangers that threaten
humanity in spite of this global civilization, and often directly
because of it. Above all, I would like to speak about the ways
in which these dangers can be confronted.<BR>
        <BR>
________________________________________________________________
<BR>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        Many of the great problems we face today, as far as I
understand them, have their origin in the fact that this global
civilization, though in evidence everywhere, is no more than a
thin veneer over the sum total of human awareness, if I may put
it that way. This civilization is immensely fresh, young, new,
and fragile, and the human spirit has accepted it with dizzying
alacrity, without itself changing in any essential way. Humanity
has evolved over long millennia in all manner of civilizations
and cultures that gradually, and in very diverse ways, shaped
our habits of mind, our relationship to the world, our models
of behaviour and the values we accept and recognize. In essence,
this new, single epidermis of world civilization merely covers
or conceals the immense variety of cultures, of peoples, of religious
worlds, of historical traditions and historically formed attitudes,
all of which in a sense lie &quot;beneath&quot; it. At the same
time, even as the veneer of world civilization expands, this &quot;underside&quot;
of humanity, this hidden dimension of it, demands more and more
clearly to be heard and to be granted a right to life.<BR>
        <BR>
        And thus, while the world as a whole increasingly accepts
the new habits of global civilization, another contradictory process
is taking place: ancient traditions are reviving, different religions
and cultures are awakening to new ways of being, seeking new room
to exist, and struggling with growing fervour to realize what
is unique to them and what makes them different from others. Ultimately
they seek to give their individuality a political expression.
<BR>
        <BR>
        It is often said that in our time, every valley cries
out for its own independence or will even fight for it. Many nations,
or parts of them at least, are struggling against modern civilization
or its main proponents for the right to worship their ancient
gods and obey the ancient divine injunctions. They carry on their
struggle using weapons provided by the very civilization they
oppose. They employ radar, computers, lasers, nerve gases, and
perhaps, in the future, even nuclear weapons &Auml; all products
of the world they challenge &Auml; to help defend their ancient
heritage against the erosions of modern civilization. In contrast
with these technological inventions, other products of this civilization
&Auml; like democracy or the idea of human rights &Auml; are not
accepted in many places in the world because they are deemed to
be hostile to local traditions.<BR>
        <BR>
        In other words: the EuroAmerican world has equipped other
parts of the globe with instruments that not only could effectively
destroy the enlightened values which, among other things, made
possible the invention of precisely these instruments, but which
could well cripple the capacity of people to live together on
this earth.<BR>
        <BR>
        What follows from all of this?<BR>
        <BR>
        It is my belief that this state of affairs contains a
clear challenge not only to the Euro-American world but to our
present-day civilization as a whole. It is a challenge to this
civilization to start understanding itself as a multicultural
and a multipolar civilization, whose meaning lies not in undermining
the individuality of different spheres of culture and civilization
but in allowing them to be more completely themselves. This will
only be possible, even conceivable, if we all accept a basic code
of mutual coexistence, a kind of common minimum we can all share,
one that will enable us to go on living side by side. Yet such
a code won't stand a chance if it is merely the product of a few
who then proceed to force it on the rest. It must be an expression
of the authentic will of everyone, growing out of the genuine
spiritual roots hidden beneath the skin of our common, global
civilization. If it is merely disseminated through the capillaries
of this skin, the way Cocacola ads are &Auml; as a commodity offered
by some to others &Auml; such a code can hardly be expected to
take hold in any profound or universal way.<BR>
        <BR>
        But is humanity capable of such an undertaking? Is it
not a hopelessly utopian idea? Haven't we so lost control of our
destiny that we are condemned to gradual extinction in ever harsher
hightech clashes between cultures, because of our fatal inability
to cooperate in the face of impending catastrophes, be they ecological,
social, or demographic, or of dangers generated by the state of
our civilization as such?<BR>
        <BR>
________________________________________________________________
<BR>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        I don't know.<BR>
        <BR>
        But I have not lost hope.<BR>
        <BR>
        I have not lost hope because I am persuaded again and
again that, lying dormant in the deepest roots of most, if not
all, cultures there is an essential similarity, something that
could be made &Auml; if the will to do so existed &Auml; a genuinely
unifying starting point for that new code of human coexistence
that would be firmly anchored in the great diversity of human
traditions.<BR>
        <BR>
        Don't we find somewhere in the foundations of most religions
and cultures, though they may take a thousand and one distinct
forms, common elements such as respect for what transcends us,
whether we mean the mystery of Being, or a moral order that stands
above us; certain imperatives that come to us from heaven, or
from nature, or from our own hearts; a belief that our deeds will
live after us; respect for our neighbours, for our families, for
certain natural authorities; respect for human dignity and for
nature: a sense of solidarity and benevolence towards guests who
come with good intentions?<BR>
        <BR>
        Isn't the common, ancient origin or human roots of our
diverse spiritualities, each of which is merely another kind of
human understanding of the same reality, the thing that can genuinely
bring people of different cultures together?<BR>
        <BR>
        And aren't the basic commandments of this archetypal spirituality
in harmony with what even an unreligious person &Auml; without
knowing exactly why &Auml; may consider proper and meaningful?
<BR>
        <BR>
        Naturally, I am not suggesting that modern people be compelled
to worship ancient deities and accept rituals they have long since
abandoned. I am suggesting something quite different: we must
come to understand the deep mutual connection or kinship between
the various forms of our spirituality. We must recollect our original
spiritual and moral substance, which grew out of the same essential
experience of humanity. I believe that this is the only way to
achieve a genuine renewal of our sense of responsibility for ourselves
and for the world. And at the same time, it is the only way to
achieve a deeper understanding among cultures that will enable
them to work together in a truly ecumenical way to create a new
order for the world.<BR>
        <BR>
_______________________________________________________________
<BR>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        The veneer of global civilization that envelops the modern
world and the consciousness of humanity, as we all know, has a
dual nature, bringing into question, at every step of the way,
the very values it is based upon, or which it propagates. The
thousands of marvelous achievements of this civilization that
work for us so well and enrich us can equally impoverish, diminish,
and destroy our lives, and frequently do. Instead of serving people,
many of these creations enslave them. Instead of helping people
to develop their identities, they take them away. Almost every
invention or discovery - from the splitting of the atom and the
discovery of DNA to television and the computer - can be turned
against us and used to our detriment. How much easier it is today
than it was during the First World War to destroy an entire metropolis
in a single airraid. And how much easier would it be today, in
the era of television, for a madman like Hitler or Stalin to pervert
the spirit of a whole nation. When have people ever had the power
we now possess to alter the climate of the planet or deplete its
mineral resources or the wealth of its fauna and flora in the
space of a few short decades? And how much more destructive potential
do terrorists have at their disposal today than at the beginning
of this century.<BR>
        <BR>
        In our era, it would seem that one part of the human brain,
the rational part which has made all these morally neutral discoveries,
has undergone exceptional development, while the other part, which
should be alert to ensure that these discoveries really serve
humanity and will not destroy it, has lagged behind catastrophically.
<BR>
        <BR>
        Yes, regardless of where I begin my thinking about the
problems facing our civilization, I always return to the theme
of human responsibility, which seems incapable of keeping pace
with civilization and preventing it from turning against the human
race. It's as though the world has simply become too much for
us to deal with.<BR>
        <BR>
        There is no way back. Only a dreamer can believe that
the solution lies in curtailing the progress of civilization in
some way or other. The main task in the coming era is something
else: a radical renewal of our sense of responsibility. Our conscience
must catch up to our reason, otherwise we are lost.<BR>
        <BR>
        It is my profound belief that there is only one way to
achieve this: we must divest ourselves of our egoistical anthropocentrism,
our habit of seeing ourselves as masters of the universe who can
do whatever occurs to us. We must discover a new respect for what
transcends us: for the universe, for the earth, for nature, for
life, and for reality. Our respect for other people, for other
nations, and for other cultures, can only grow from a humble respect
for the cosmic order and from an awareness that we are a part
of it, that we share in it and that nothing of what we do is lost,
but rather becomes part of the eternal memory of Being, where
it is judged.<BR>
        <BR>
        A better alternative for the future of humanity, therefore,
clearly lies in imbuing our civilization with a spiritual dimension.
It's not just a matter of understanding its multicultural nature
and finding inspiration for the creation of a new world order
in the common roots of all cultures. It is also essential that
the EuroAmerican cultural sphere - the one which created this
civilization and taught humanity its destructive pride - now return
to its own spiritual roots and become an example to the rest of
the world in the search for a new humility.<BR>
        <BR>
_______________________________________________________________
<BR>
        <BR>
        General observations of this type are certainly not difficult
to make, nor are they new or revolutionary. Modern people are
masters at describing the crises and the misery of the world which
we shape, and for which we are responsible. We are much less adept
at putting things right.<BR>
        <BR>
        So what specifically is to be done?<BR>
        <BR>
        I do not believe in some universal key or panacea. I am
not an advocate of what Karl Popper called &quot;holistic social
engineering&quot;, particularly because I had to live most of
my adult life in circumstances that resulted from an attempt to
create a holistic Marxist utopia. I know more than enough, therefore,
about efforts of this kind.<BR>
        <BR>
        This does not relieve me, however, of the responsibility
to think of ways to make the world better.<BR>
        <BR>
        It will certainly not be easy to awaken in people a new
sense of responsibility for the world, an ability to conduct themselves
as if they were to live on this earth forever, and to be held
answerable for its condition one day. Who knows how many horrific
cataclysms humanity may have to go through before such a sense
of responsibility is generally accepted. But this does not mean
that those who wish to work for it cannot begin at once. It is
a great task for teachers, educators, intellectuals, the clergy,
artists, entrepreneurs, journalists, people active in all forms
of public life.<BR>
        <BR>
        Above all it is a task for politicians.<BR>
        <BR>
        Even in the most democratic of conditions, politicians
have immense influence, perhaps more than they themselves realize.
This influence does not lie in their actual mandates, which in
any case are considerably limited. It lies in something else:
in the spontaneous impact their charisma has on the public.<BR>
        <BR>
        The main task of the present generation of politicians
is not, I think, to ingratiate themselves with the public through
the decisions they take or their smiles on television. It is not
to go on winning elections and ensuring themselves a place in
the sun till the end of their days. Their role is something quite
different: to assume their share of responsibility for the longrange
prospects of our world and thus to set an example for the public
in whose sight they work. Their responsibility is to think ahead
boldly, not to fear the disfavour of the crowd, to imbue their
actions with a spiritual dimension (which of course is not the
same thing as ostentatious attendance at religious services),
to explain again and again - both to the public and to their colleagues
&Auml; that politics must do far more than reflect the interests
of particular groups or lobbies. After all, politics is a matter
of serving the community, which means that it is morality in practice.
And how better to serve the community and practise morality than
by seeking in the midst of the global (and globally threatened)
civilization their own global political responsibility: that is,
their responsibility for the very survival of the human race?
<BR>
        <BR>
        I don't believe that a politician who sets out on this
risky path will inevitably jeopardize his or her political survival.
This is a wrongheaded notion which assumes that the citizen is
a fool and that political success depends on playing to this folly.
That is not the way it is. A conscience slumbers in every human
being, something divine. And that is what we have to put our trust
in.<BR>

<BR>
        <BR>
        Ladies and gentlemen,<BR>
        <BR>
        I find myself at perhaps the most famous university in
the most powerful country in the world. With your permission,
I will say a few words on the subject of the politics of a great
power.<BR>
        <BR>
        It is obvious that those who have the greatest power and
influence also bear the greatest responsibility. Like it or not,
the United States of America now bears probably the greatest responsibility
for the direction our world will take. The United States, therefore,
should reflect most deeply on this responsibility.<BR>
        <BR>
        Isolationism has never paid off for the United States.
Had it entered the First World War earlier, perhaps it would not
have had to pay with anything like the casualties it actually
incurred.<BR>
        <BR>
        The same is true of the Second World War: when Hitler
was getting ready to invade Czechoslovakia, and in so doing finally
expose the lack of courage on the part of the western democracies,
your President wrote a letter to the Czechoslovak President imploring
him to come to some agreement with Hitler. Had he not deceived
himself and the whole world into believing that an agreement could
be made with this madman, had he instead shown a few teeth, perhaps
the Second World War need not have happened, and tens of thousands
of young Americans need not have died fighting in it.<BR>
        <BR>
        Likewise, just before the end of that war, had your President,
who was otherwise an outstanding man, said a clear &quot;no&quot;
to Stalin's decision to divide the world, perhaps the Cold War,
which cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars,
need not have happened either. <BR>
        <BR>
        I beg you: do not repeat these mistakes! You yourselves
have always paid a heavy price for them! There is simply no escaping
the responsibility you have as the most powerful country in the
world.<BR>
        <BR>
        There is far more at stake here than simply standing up
to those who would like once again to divide the world into spheres
of interest, or subjugate others who are different from them,
and weaker. What is now at stake is saving the human race. In
other words, it's a question of what I've already talked about:
of understanding modern civilization as a multicultural and multipolar
civilization, of turning our attention to the original spiritual
sources of human culture and above all, of our own culture, of
drawing from these sources the strength for a courageous and magnanimous
creation of a new order for the world.<BR>
        <BR>
        Not long ago I was at a gala dinner to mark an important
anniversary. There were fifty Heads of State present, perhaps
more, who came to honour the heroes and victims of the greatest
war in human history. This was not a political conference, but
the kind of social event that is meant principally to show hospitality
and respect to the invited guests. When the seating plan was given
out, I discovered to my surprise that those sitting at the table
next to mine were not identified simply as representatives of
a particular state, as was the case with all the other tables;
they were referred to as &quot;permanent members of the UN Security
Council and the G7.&quot; I had mixed feelings about this. On
the one hand, I thought how marvelous that the richest and most
powerful of this world see each other often and even at this dinner,
can talk informally and get to know each other better. On the
other hand, a slight chill went down my spine, for I could not
help observing that one table had been singled out as being special
and particularly important. It was a table for the big powers.
Somewhat perversely, I began to imagine that the people sitting
at it were, along with their Russian caviar, dividing the rest
of us up among themselves, without asking our opinion. Perhaps
all this is merely the whimsy of a former and perhaps future playwright.
But I wanted to express it here. For one simple reason: to emphasize
the terrible gap that exists between the responsibility of the
great powers and their hubris. The architect of that seating arrangement
&Auml; I should think it was none of the attending Presidents
&Auml; was not guided by a sense of responsibility for the world,
but by the banal pride of the powerful.<BR>
        <BR>
        But pride is precisely what will lead the world to hell.
I am suggesting an alternative: humbly accepting our responsibility
for the world.<BR>
        <BR>
_______________________________________________________________
<BR>
        <BR>
        There is one great opportunity in the matter of coexistence
between nations and spheres of civilization, culture and religion
that should be grasped and exploited to the limit. This is the
appearance of supranational or regional communities. By now, there
are many such communities in the world, with diverse characteristics
and differing degrees of integration. I believe in this approach.
I believe in the importance of organisms that lie somewhere between
nation states and a world community, organisms that can be an
important medium of global communication and cooperation. I believe
that this trend towards integration in a world where &Auml; as
I've said &Auml; every valley longs for independence, must be
given the greatest possible support. These organisms, however,
must not be an expression of integration merely for the sake of
integration. They must be one of the many instruments enabling
each region, each nation, to be both itself and capable of cooperation
with others. That is, they must be one of the instruments enabling
countries and peoples who are close to each other geographically,
ethnically, culturally and economically and who have common security
interests, to form associations and better communicate with each
other and with the rest of the world. At the same time, all such
regional communities must rid themselves of fear that other like
communities are directed against them. Regional groupings in areas
that have common traditions and a common political culture ought
to be a natural part of the complex political architecture of
the world. Cooperation between such regions ought to be a natural
component of cooperation on a worldwide scale. As long as the
broadening of NATO membership to include countries who feel culturally
and politically a part of the region the Alliance was created
to defend is seen by Russia, for example, as an anti-Russian undertaking,
it will be a sign that Russia has not yet understood the challenge
of this era.<BR>
        <BR>
        The most important world organization is the United Nations.
I think that the fiftieth anniversary of its birth could be an
occasion to reflect on how to infuse it with a new ethos, a new
strength, and a new meaning, and make it the truly most important
arena of good cooperation among all cultures that make up our
planetary civilization.<BR>
        <BR>
        But neither the strengthening of regional structures nor
the strengthening of the UN will save the world if both processes
are not informed by that renewed spiritual charge which I see
as the only hope that the human race will survive another millennium.
<BR>
        <BR>
_______________________________________________________________
<BR>
        <BR>
        I have touched on what I think politicians should do.
<BR>
        <BR>
        There is, however, one more force that has at least as
much, if not more, influence on the general state of mind as politicians
do.<BR>
        <BR>
        That force is the mass media. <BR>
        <BR>
        Only when fate sent me into the realm of high politics
did I become fully aware of the media's doubleedged power. Their
dual impact is not a specialty of the media. It is merely a part,
or an expression of the dual nature of today's civilization of
which I have already spoken.<BR>
        <BR>
        Thanks to television the whole world discovered, in the
course of an evening, that there is a country called Rwanda where
people are suffering beyond belief. Thanks to television it is
possible to do at least a little to help those who are suffering.
Thanks to television the whole world, in the course of a few seconds,
was shocked and horrified about what happened in Oklahoma City
and, at the same time, understood it as a great warning for all.
Thanks to television the whole world knows that there exists an
internationally recognized country called Bosnia and Herzegovina
and that from the moment it recognized this country, the international
community has tried unsuccessfully to divide it into grotesque
ministates according to the wishes of warlords who have never
been recognized by anyone as anyone's legitimate representatives.
<BR>
        <BR>
        That is the wonderful side of today's mass media, or rather,
of those who gather the news. Humanity's thanks belong to all
those courageous reporters who voluntarily risk their lives wherever
something evil is happening, in order to arouse the conscience
of the world.<BR>
        <BR>
        There is, however, another, less wonderful, aspect of
television, one that merely revels in the horrors of the world
or, unforgivably, makes them commonplace, or compels politicians
to become first of all television stars. But where is it written
that someone who is good on television is necessarily also a good
politician? I never fail to be astonished at how much I am at
the mercy of television directors and editors, at how my public
image depends far more on them than it does on myself, at how
important it is to smile appropriately on television, or choose
the right tie, at how television forces me to express my thoughts
as sparely as possible, in witticisms, slogans or sound bites,
at how easily my television image can be made to seem different
from the real me. I am astonished by this and at the same time,
I fear it serves no good purpose. I know politicians who have
learned to see themselves only as the television camera does.
Television has thus expropriated their personalities, and made
them into something like television shadows of their former selves.
I sometimes wonder whether they even sleep in a way that will
look good on television. <BR>
        <BR>
        I am not outraged with television or the press for distorting
what I say, or ignoring it, or editing me to appear like some
strange monster. I am not angry with the media when I see that
a politician's rise or fall often depends more on them than on
the politician concerned. What interests me is something else:
the responsibility of those who have the mass media in their hands.
They too bear responsibility for the world, and for the future
of humanity. Just as the splitting of the atom can immensely enrich
humanity in a thousand and one ways and, at the same time, can
also threaten it with destruction, so television can have both
good and evil consequences. Quickly, suggestively, and to an unprecedented
degree, it can disseminate the spirit of understanding, humanity,
human solidarity and spirituality, or it can stupefy whole nations
and continents. And just as our use of atomic energy depends solely
on our sense of responsibility, so the proper use of television's
power to enter practically every household and every human mind
depends on our sense of responsibility as well.<BR>
        <BR>
        Whether our world is to be saved from everything that
threatens it today depends above all on whether human beings come
to their senses, whether they understand the degree of their responsibility
and discover a new relationship to the very miracle of Being.
The world is in the hands of us all. And yet some have a greater
influence on its fate than others. The more influence a person
has &Auml; be they politician or television announcer &Auml; the
greater the demands placed on their sense of responsibility and
the less they should think merely about personal interests.<BR>
        <BR>
        Ladies and gentlemen,<BR>
        <BR>
        In conclusion allow me a brief personal remark. I was
born in Prague and I lived there for decades without being allowed
to study properly or visit other countries. Nevertheless, my mother
never abandoned one of her secret and quite extravagant dreams:
that one day I would study at Harvard. Fate did not permit me
to fulfil her dream. But something else happened, something that
would never have occurred even to my mother: I have received a
doctoral degree at Harvard without even having to study here.

        More than that, I have been given to see Singapore, and
countless other exotic places. I have been given to understand
how small this world is and how it torments itself with countless
things it need not torment itself with if people could find within
themselves a little more courage, a little more hope, a little
more responsibility, a little more mutual understanding and love.
<BR>
        <BR>
        I don't know whether my mother is looking down at me from
heaven, but if she is I can guess what she's probably thinking:
she's thinking that I'm sticking my nose into matters that only
people who have properly studied political science at Harvard
have the right to stick their noses into. <BR>
        <BR>
        I hope that you don't think so.<BR>
        <BR>
        Thank you for your attention.

Address
<P>
by
<P>
Vaclav Havel,
<P>
President of the Czech Republic,
<P>
on the occasion of the inauguration
<P>
of the Human Rights Building
<P>
Strasbourg, France
<P>
29 June 1995
</CENTER>

<P>
Mr. Secretary-General,
<P>
Excellencies,
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>
It is a great honour for me to be invited to speak, on behalf
of the country which now holds the chair in the Committee of Ministers
of the Council of Europe, on this very special day when the Council
of Europe inaugurates the Human Rights Building. I firmly believe
that this house will soon become a materialized symbol of the
values the sharing of which has been the driving force behind
European unification.
<P>
With your permission, I should like to take this opportunity to
present to you one general observation on human rights and one
specific observation about those who put them in jeopardy.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
We who tried in the past to resist the totalitarian system in
the countries of the former Communist bloc used to be referred
to either as dissidents or as human rights champions. The former
of these two names was rather inaccurate, the latter - though
somewhat pathetic - came nearer to reality. The concept of respect
for human rights, as they are laid down in various international
conventions, was indeed the starting point for our endeavours,
and most of the documents which we brought out, incurring persecution
for doing so, were principally criticisms of the massive violations
of human rights by the Communist regimes. Nevertheless, I will
admit that one pretty weird, almost heretical question occurred
to me time and again throughout my dissident years. I asked myself
why in fact humanity should be supposed to enjoy such and such
human rights, where the prime origin of these rights was, who
had ever said that these were the rights human beings should have,
or why we were taking it for granted that we had the right to
any rights at all. The answers that are offered and generally
accepted today, such as that this is a product of the development
of human civilization, a fruit of human self-reflection as it
has been subsequently embodied in social contracts between people
who agreed upon what were to be their vested, natural or inalienable
rights, failed to satisfy me. The more I have thought about it,
the more I have been led to believe that the prime origin of these
rights must lay in something deeper than a mere contract. I have
been ever less willing to accept the idea that things such as
the right to life, freedom of thought, respect for human dignity
or equality before the law should be worth making sacrifices for
just because someone reached agreement that these were reasonable
principles that met human needs, or that were practical for human
coexistence on this earth.
<P>
Don't worry, it is not my intention to take up your time with
boring descriptions of my train of thought or comments on my philosophical
convictions. I shall limit myself to stating my considered opinion
that while the present-day concept of human rights indeed takes
a form which derives from the state of civilization today, the
set of values and imperatives which it reflects is rooted elsewhere:
in a deeper, truly profound inner experience, an archetypal human
experience of the world and of humanity itself within this world.
Already in long bygone times, long before the term 'human rights'
was coined, the human mind realized that the higher order of Being
of which it is a part puts it under a certain obligation. Different
cultures, both past and present, have perceived this obligation
in different ways in terms of form and sometimes in terms of content
as well, but all have agreed that this title or obligation comes,
so to speak, from without, as its background has the dimensions
of the infinite, and of eternity. In other words: the concept
of human rights is only one of the ways in which our present civilization
gives expression to what might be called the moral order, whose
existence is part of the fundamental experience of humanity as
conscious creatures - experience of something which transcends
us, which - to put it in plain words - exists beyond us. There
are simply certain things which people do not just because they
have agreed with other people on doing them, or because they have
found them practical.
<P>
Various manifestations of crises in the world today apparently
corroborate this opinion. Don't they all emanate from one common
cause - from a decline of human responsibility for our world,
precisely the kind of responsibility that relates to higher authorities
rather than to those underlying a simple intention to adhere to
certain standards endorsed by a vote ? Don't we find an explanation
for many such developments in the decline of humanity's readiness
to honour the order of Being that stands above the human person
and to conduct ourselves responsibly even when nobody sees us,
when there is nobody to tell on us to any mundane authorities
that may have been put in charge of overseeing observance of certain
agreed rules ? And isn't it this decline of the modern spirit
that provokes many cultures to revolt against such contemporary
standards in which they do not find any deities to worship, and
which they therefore deem to be lacking a proper metaphysical
anchor?
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
There has been much discussion about whether human rights in the
form which is now accepted in the Euro-American cultural sphere
are truly universal, that is, whether their observance can be
required of everyone, or whether they are only a product of one
particular culture that cannot be imposed upon other cultures
which are based on different world outlooks and different traditions.
<P>
If we were to perceive human rights as a mere product of a social
contract the answer to this question would be clear: we would
have no right whatsoever to demand that they be observed by anyone
who has not subscribed to this contract or who has had no part
in devising it. No group can justifiably claim that what its members
have agreed upon among themselves applies automatically to everyone
else as well, nor can it purport that only what this particular
group deems right is truly universal, and right for all.
<P>
If we, however, recognize that respect for human rights as a political
requirement or imperative is actually a political expression of
moral obligations anchored in the general human experience of
the absolute, any reasons for relativist scepticism cease to be
valid. While this recognition alone does not win any battles,
at least it paves the way: universality of human rights can be
successfully defended if we look for its truly universal spiritual
roots. That is, if we join forces in a search for what most cultures
have in common and if we attempt a new reflection on the most
profound points of departure from which our manifold cultures
have grown. In reality, these starting points are much closer
to one another than they now seem to be. The more we cling to
the mere surface of things the more the otherness in diverse cultures
conceals the depths of affinity among them. The way to genuine
universalism does not lead through compromises among various contemporary
forms of otherness but in a joint quest to bring back humanity's
common primeval experience of the universe, and of the human being
within it.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
A few hundred kilometres away from here, a dreadful war frenzy
is raging, and we are all helplessly watching, waiting to see
who will win - the Serbs or the others. What we are completely
forgetting is the fact that this is not just a war between the
Serbs and the others. This is a war for our own future - a war
of those to whom their tribal otherness is the ultimate value
against all those who embrace higher values than the blood group
which they happen to belong to. This war is waged against us all,
against human rights, against the coexistence of people of different
nationalities or religious beliefs, against the civic principle;
it is a war for what divides us, and against what brings us together.
The war in Bosnia is in fact a war against meaningful human coexistence
based on the universality of human rights derived from the universality
of the primeval human experience of the universe. It is an attack
of the darkest past on a decent future, an attack of evil on the
moral order.
<P>
We have to stop this war. Yet, we shall not stop it by engaging
in hopeless attempts to work out compromises between a number
of othernesses - compromises whose consequences would amount to
confirming otherness as the supreme principle. There is only one
way in which we can stop the war without being left defeated,
if this is still in fact possible: by calling evil evil, by pointing
out who is to blame, and who is the victim, by saying at last
in no uncertain terms what this war is all about.
<P>
The Council of Europe obviously cannot put an end to this war.
But the states united in the Council possess the strength to do
so. The responsibility of the Council of Europe, a maker and guardian
of European and universal values, consists in throwing light on
this war, in calling it by its right name, in saying outright
that this is a war against all the values which the Council has
enshrined in its documents, which it cherishes and which it has
tried to nurture and cultivate.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
This is a festive occasion. I have not meant to spoil it by bringing
in disturbing tones. My intention has been to stress that what
is to be fostered and guarded in this Building is right now the
target of a brutal attack not so far away from here, and that
the values which all of us have subscribed to have enemies in
our immediate vicinity. If we let these enemies prevail over human
solidarity and the will to live together, others like them, and
new ones, will emerge. Dark forces of tribal hatred lie dormant
in many a part. If we let them get the upper hand in one place,
they will begin to awake in many other places as well. We must
not allow this to happen at the very moment when Europe has, for
the first time ever in its history, a chance of building its political
order on the principle of peaceful coexistence and cooperation
on a footing of equality among all its nations, on the principles
of democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law and civil
statehood.
<P>
Europe - like the whole world today - currently finds itself at
a crucial historical crossroads. It shall either succeed in embracing
a new sense of responsibility, one that will grow out of the universal
spiritual experience of the human race and heed the moral message
which this experience holds for us, or it shall again commit the
same fatal error for which it paid such a terrible price twice
before in this century - the error of closing its eyes to the
emerging evil of nationalism which, like any evil, is contagious.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>
Let me conclude by voicing my enduring hope that human reason,
decency, solidarity and preparedness to seek understanding and
to live together in fairness will triumph over everything which
threatens them. I have no doubt that the Council of Europe and
its various institutions, including those to reside in this Building,
will make a major contribution towards achieving this - not by
using instruments of power, which the Council does not have, but
by pursuing further the great endeavour which it undertook several
decades ago, that is, by continuing to promote, intensify and
spread a good spirit of cooperation among nations.
<P>
Thank you for your attention.

<P>
Distinguished Mr. Kovalev,
<P>
Distinguished Mr. Mayor,
<P>
Distinguished Members of the Jury of the Nuremberg International
Human Rights Award,
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
<P>
Precisely sixty years ago this historical city of Nuremberg became
the stage for one of the key moments of the greatest horror and
ignominy of this century. During the so-called Reichsparteitag
der Freiheit, a rally of the National Socialist German Workers'
Party (NSDAP), in an atmosphere of bombastic Nazi parades, the
Reichstag, by then no more than a contemptible caricature of the
previous parliament of the German people, adopted the infamous
legislation reducing one group of people to the status of inferior
beings, segregating them both politically and racially from the
rest of German society. It was these publicly declared guidelines
that eventually led to the largest mass murder in history.
<P>
The evil began to spread. On the basis of the Nuremberg Laws and
other absurd directives people began to be classified as members
of a higher or a lower race, a higher or a lower people; blood
and &quot;racial purity&quot; soon became a requirement for participation
in public life, for admission to schools and decent jobs, and
ultimately for mere survival.
<P>
_____________________________________________________________
<P>
Western democracies, unfortunately, remained deaf and blind to
this reality, limiting themselves by and large to a mere formal
criticism of these so-called laws. As a result of the democratic
powers' cautiousness and reluctance to intervene in a forceful
way, the policy of appeasement prevailed. The criminals who proclaimed
the Nuremberg Laws were strengthened in their belief that they
were free to implement them with impunity. As part and parcel
of the brown plague, the Nuremberg Laws infected also the territories
that were joined to or annexed by the Nazi Reich, without any
significant opposition on the part of the international community.
The last chance to challenge these policies was lost in 1938,
when the European democracies failed the test of their commitment
to defence and solidarity. By this I mean the Munich Agreement,
a document that destroyed a democratic state which had previously
granted asylum to thousands of both Jewish and German refugees
alike, a state in which provisions such as the Nuremberg Laws
had been unthinkable until then. At the same time, this act debased
the honour, self-respect and self-confidence of the democratic
politicians and discredited their mandate.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
Along with the Munich diktat, the Nurenberg Laws came to my country,
too. The flaming synagogues in Liberec and other towns in the
Czech borderlands on the so-called Kristallnacht were a logical
outcome of that. Tens of thousands of our citizens, particularly
Jews, fled in terror to the interior which was still somewhat
safer at the time. But the chance to stop the evil had been squandered.
What followed, inevitably, was the occupation of the rest of the
Czech lands, the invasion of Poland, the first mass transport
of European Jews from the Moravian-Silesian city of Ostrava to
Nisko in Poland, transports to Theresienstadt and from there to
Auschwitz. Needless to say, the tragedy of the Czech Jews was
but one part in the larger apocalypse of the Holocaust and the
policy of the so-called final solution for entire nations and
states.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
How was it possible for an ideology as perverted as National Socialism
to come into being in a civilized European country ? How was it
possible for legislation that made a mockery of law to be adopted
in Nuremberg, an old European city associated with the historical
codification of city law ? And how was it possible for the democratic
powers to just stand by and watch, thereby allowing this wrong-doing
to spread ?
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
It seems that many politicians regarded democracy as nothing but
a mechanism of generating political will while the awareness of
its moral foundations was lost. It was not until the outbreak
of World War II that democrats realized that it does not pay to
tolerate the intolerable and to use standard diplomatic methods
when dealing with a regime that violates every rule on which European
civilization has been built. The price that had to be paid for
their slowness in understanding this was high indeed.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
After the war everyone felt sure that nothing like it could happen,
or be allowed to happen, ever again. Nuremberg, the site of Nazi
party congresses and of the adoption of racial laws, played host
to the trials that introduced the institute of an international
war crimes tribunal, intended to serve as a warning to all those
who might consider similar practices in the future. One other
outcome of World War II was the creation of the United Nations
- an institution whose mission has been to prevent such horrors
from being repeated. One of the lessons to be drawn from World
War II is that the international community should not think just
mechanically in terms of balance of power among individual nations.
It should also look at what is going on inside those countries.
For the Munich Agreement was a direct consequence of the mistaken
belief that for the sake of maintaining a balance of power concessions
could be made even to a regime that promulgated the Nuremberg
Laws. The horrors of the Holocaust and the sufferings of the war
were the fruits of that.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
However, it appears as if humankind will never learn. There are
still those who seek to divide people according to their ethnic
affiliations and to revive the spirit of tribal wars. There are
still those who believe that atrocities perpetrated in wartime
will go unpunished, and therefore provoke wars, ridiculing the
international community. And there are still democratic governments
that believe aggressors can be stopped with concessions, with
piecemeal manoeuvring, in a word, by giving in to evil. The United
Nations, too - though undeniably it has often played a positive
role in settling international disputes - still has a long way
to go if it wants to live up to the expectations and objectives
of its founders.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
As World War II becomes increasingly remote with the years, and
especially now that Communism has collapsed, the vigilance of
the democrats seems to have slackened. Again, democracy seems
to have been reduced to a mere routine, a mechanism for shaping
political will. Yet, if democracy is to remain vital the values
on which it is founded must be constantly renewed. Today again
we need politicians who remember the ethical basis of democracy
and who understand that one cannot rely on routine diplomacy when
dealing with militant nationalists. Aggressors cannot be stopped
with Chamberlain-style policies. For the same reason we also need
citizens who are able to recognize evil at its inception and stand
up to it despite the personal risks, and then voice their position
clearly, in the most resolute terms, to their political representatives.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
Fifty years after World War II Europe is still suffering from
armed conflicts, in particular from the war in the former Yugoslavia
and strife in several areas of the former Soviet Union. Oftentimes,
power-hungry men have made these conflicts into tribal wars in
which age-old ethnic hatreds are revived and ignited into violence.
In these regions it is our duty, and also in our own interests,
to support those forces that are committed to the values of civil
society and human rights. It is in their midst that we find Sergei
Adamovich Kovalev. His entire life he has demonstrated his devotion
to the concept of human rights as well as courage in struggling
to make them a reality. This modest scientist began his work on
behalf of human rights under Communist rule, as early as 1967,
becoming a close collaborator of Andrei Sakharov. In 1969 Kovalev
was one of the founders of the Initiative Group for Human Rights.
First as a contributor and later as an editor, he was involved
in the publication of the Chronicle of Current Events, an underground
publication that reported human rights abuses in the USSR. In
1970 he lost his job as a scientist; in 1974 he was arrested,
charged with &quot;anti-Soviet propaganda&quot; and sentenced
to seven years in prison plus three more years of detention in
Siberia. After serving that sentence, he lived in Kalinin, being
banned from living in Moscow. In 1987 Kovalev returned to Moscow
and joined the Human Rights Group of the International Fund for
Survival and Development of Humanity. In 1990 he became Chairman
of the Human Rights Committee of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian
Federation. That same year he began serving as the head of the
Russian delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Commission
in Geneva.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
To the whole world Sergei Kovalev's name has become a symbol of
opposition to the bloody conflict in Chechnya, the victims of
which have been for the most part civilians subjected to untold
suffering. Sergei Kovalev's courageous conduct on the scene of
the hostilities in Grozny was likewise a battle for democracy
in today's Russia. He has spoken out against all of the dangerous
aspects of the Chechnyan conflict that jeopardize the further
development of Russian society, and has worked hard to promote
democracy, human rights and the principles of civil society. Sergei
Kovalev has become the foremost representative of Russian democrats
whose ranks include not only politicians and other publicly active
figures, but also ordinary citizens who have dared to speak out
against the violence, injustice and threats to the democratic
development of their country. Kovalev alone knows best how difficult
it is to defy those who continue to long for the return of the
old days.
<P>
It is characteristic of Sergei Kovalev that he begins to act the
moment he sees an opportunity to help. We all followed with great
anxiety the terrorist attack in the South Russian town of Budjonnovsk
and Kovalev's efforts to mediate talks between the two sides -
efforts that culminated in success.
<P>
At present Sergei Kovalev is an authority recognized the world
over. Today's world needs people like Kovalev who, himself a politician,
shows us, the other politicians, how we should think and act.
It is people like him who represent a guarantee that there will
be no more Nuremberg Laws and Munich Agreements.
<P>
______________________________________________________________
<P>
The city of Nuremberg seeks to serve as a transmitter of signals
fostering understanding among nations. I see one such signal in
the fact that I, a Czech, have been given the honour to address
this forum. My fellow citizens have followed with pleasure and
appreciation all that the city of Nuremberg, an important centre
of a region bordering on the Czech Republic, has been doing for
the good of Czech-German relations. In short, it is fitting that
Nuremberg, remembering its turbulent history, is aware of its
share of responsibility for the state of the world today, and
that it has an acute understanding for a crucial imperative emanating
from the stormy history of the twentieth century, namely that
evil must be combatted at its inception. It is fitting that the
Nuremberg International Human Rights Award has been established
to honour those who are prepared to stand up to evil and carry
on the struggle for human rights regardless of personal risk.
It is fitting that Sergei Kovalev is the first recipient of this
award.
<P>
Dear Sergei Adamovich, I congratulate you on this high distinction.

Chronique de Richard SILVANI   SCEM  Pr&eacute;vision marine.<P>
<P>
Auguin tente de contourner l'anticyclone, le cap Horn dans trois ou quatre jours pour le trio de chasse,<P>
toujours pas de nouvelle de Gerry.<P>
</H2>
Christophe, dans un petit vent de sud ouest, tente de contourner une cellule anticyclone qui lui barre la route directe. En passant par la face est de cette cellule, il compte bien continuer &agrave; naviguer dans un r&eacute;gime de portant qui convient mieux &agrave; son bateau, et qui aussi, est beaucoup plus confortable pour lui.<P>
Le trio Thiecelin, Laurent et De Broc continu sa progression vers le cap Horn dans un r&eacute;gime de sud ouest 20/25 nds qui s'essouffle un peu. Attention dans les r&eacute;troviseurs, nouveau coup de vent pr&eacute;vu dans la nuit de mercredi &agrave; jeudi, donc, aux abords du cap.<P>
Intercal&eacute;e, mais plus class&eacute;e, Isabelle Autissier voit son vent du sud ouest adonner et s'orienter secteur ouest 10/20 nds. <P>

<H2>
Fort coup de vent pour Dumont, vent d'ouest pour Chabaud et Parlier.<P>
</H2>
Eric Dumont subit actuellement un fort coup de vent de secteur ouest sud ouest 40/50 nds la mer est grosse. Ces conditions vont persister jusqu'&agrave; demain, milieu de journ&eacute;e, prudence Eric.<P>
C'est dans un vent d'ouest &agrave; ouest nord ouest, plus fort au sud qu'au nord, 30/35 nds pour 15/20 nds, que Yves et Catherine continue leur route vers l'est. Demain en cours d'apr&egrave;s midi leur vent part &agrave; gauche et se g&eacute;n&eacute;ralise au suro&icirc;t 20/25 nds, la mer est agit&eacute;e &agrave; forte.<P>
Pete Goss devrait sortir aujourd'hui de l'anticyclone qui le freine depuis 48 heures.<P>
De Radigues retrouve des vents portants de secteur sud ouest et peux enfin plonger vers le grand sud. <P>

<H2>NIVOSE : la neige mesur&eacute;e</H2>
Les donn&eacute;es transmises par les stations automatiques NIVOSE, conues par le 
<a href="http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr:8000/plaquette/cen.html">CEN</A>,
permettent un suivi en temps quasi r&eacute;el des variations d'&eacute;paisseur du manteau neigeux. 
Leur apport est capital pour le pr&eacute;visionniste avalanche dans les situations perturb&eacute;es. 
Tout accroissement de la hauteur de neige, toute accumulation ou &eacute;rosion li&eacute;es &agrave; des 
ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes de transport de la neige par le vent sont imm&eacute;diatement identifi&eacute;s et pris
en compte dans l'analyse de la stabilit&eacute; du manteau neigeux.

<H2>SAFRAN-CROCUS : la neige mod&eacute;lis&eacute;e</H2>
En compl&eacute;ment des mesures issues du r&eacute;seau nivom&eacute;t&eacute;orologique humain, qui ne permettent qu'une 
repr&eacute;sentation fragmentaire de l'&eacute;tat interne du manteau neigeux, le 
<a href="http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr:8000/plaquette/cen.html">CEN</A> a d&eacute;velopp&eacute; un mod&egrave;le d'&eacute;volution 
du manteau neigeux (CROCUS). Les variables m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques dont CROCUS a besoin sont fournies par
le mod&egrave;le SAFRAN qui fonctionne en mode analyse et en mode pr&eacute;vision. Le couple SAFRAN-CROCUS est 
capable de traduire, du d&eacute;but &agrave; la fin de l'enneigement, la tr&egrave;s grande variabilit&eacute; de la structure 
interne du manteau neigeux en fonction du massif, de l'altitude, de l'exposition.

<P>
<i>Depuis que la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie op&eacute;rationnelle existe, le service public de 
m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France a pour mission de concevoir, d&eacute;velopper, 
mettre en oeuvre et entretenir tous les moyens n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; la pr&eacute;vision du temps. 
Pour cela, il a acquis des comp&eacute;tences dans des domaines scientifiques et techniques tr&egrave;s 
vari&eacute;s, d&eacute;velopp&eacute; les mod&egrave;les informatiques les plus performants et 
constitu&eacute; une trame &eacute;troite d'observation sur tout le territoire national et au-del&agrave;.<BR>
Le temps ignore les fronti&egrave;res ; M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France intervient donc au sein de l'Organisation 
M&eacute;t&eacute;orologique Mondiale (OMM), ce qui lui permet d'enrichir ces comp&eacute;tences par 
l'&eacute;change des connaissances et la participation aux grandes campagnes internationales d'&eacute;tude 
des ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes atmosph&eacute;riques.<BR>
Les savoir-faire qu'il d&eacute;tient et les moyens d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s lui conf&egrave;rent une 
exceptionnelle ma&icirc;trise de toutes les disciplines de la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie.</i>
<P>
L'essor consid&eacute;rable que conna&icirc;t la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie op&eacute;rationnelle depuis 
la fin des ann&eacute;es soixante va de pair avec le d&eacute;veloppement de techniques qui utilisent les 
connaissances scientifiques acquises dans des domaines tr&egrave;s vari&eacute;s. La globalit&eacute; de 
l'atmosph&egrave;re et sa complexit&eacute; imposent d'adopter une d&eacute;marche scientifique 
rigoureuse.<BR>
Instrumentation, t&eacute;l&eacute;communications, informatique, analyse num&eacute;rique, 
t&eacute;l&eacute;d&eacute;tection depuis le sol et depuis l'espace, physique de l'atmosph&egrave;re, 
m&eacute;canique des fluides, etc. dressent le d&eacute;cor de la sc&egrave;ne 
m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique moderne. Car pour pr&eacute;voir le temps et, au-del&agrave;, le climat futur, 
il faut &agrave; la fois disposer de puissants moyens d'observation r&eacute;partis partout dans le monde, 
savoir analyser ces observations, les traduire en donn&eacute;es num&eacute;riques exploitables pour la 
pr&eacute;vision &agrave; court, moyen et long terme, adapter ces pr&eacute;visions &agrave; chaque 
cat&eacute;gorie d'usagers et les diffuser.<BR>
Le professionnalisme exig&eacute; et la pluridisciplinarit&eacute; pratiqu&eacute;e n'ont qu'un but : servir la 
vie sur Terre et les activit&eacute;s &eacute;conomiques.<BR>
Cr&eacute;&eacute;e voil&agrave; plus d'un si&egrave;cle avec pour mission premi&egrave;re la 
s&eacute;curit&eacute; des biens et des personnes, la M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie Nationale, devenue 
M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France en 1994, a su se doter des moyens n&eacute;cessaires pour r&eacute;pondre aux 
exigences et &agrave; l'&eacute;thique de service public tout en d&eacute;veloppant des pr&eacute;visions 
adapt&eacute;es aux diff&eacute;rentes activit&eacute;s &eacute;conomiques.

La notion d'&eacute;chelle marque la connaissance des ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques, depuis les vastes syst&egrave;mes de pression qui s'&eacute;tendent sur plusieurs milliers de kilom&egrave;tres jusqu'aux ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes de brise de vall&eacute;es qui soufflent sur quelques kilom&egrave;tres.
<BR>
L'exploitation m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique s'articule autour d'un double mouvement de l'&eacute;chelle locale vers l'&eacute;chelle globale suivi d'un retour &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle locale : observation locale, concentration des mesures, analyse et pr&eacute;vision &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle globale, diffusion des r&eacute;sultats, adaptation locale, distribution aux usagers.
<BR>
L'organisation de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France, r&eacute;pond &agrave; cette r&eacute;alit&eacute;, au moyen d'une structure  op&eacute;rationnelle &agrave; 3 niveaux :
<DL>
<DD><LI>le centre national de Toulouse <a href="/scem/accueil.html">(SCEM)</a> est &agrave; la fois le point d'ancrage de la France sur le syst&egrave;me mondial de transmission de donn&eacute;es et le centre de traitement a l'&eacute;chelle globale.
<DD><LI><a href="/meteo/france.html">les 93 Centres D&eacute;partementaux de la M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie</a> prennent en charge l'&eacute;chelon local.
<DD><LI>entre les deux &eacute;chelons pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents, les centres r&eacute;gionaux, <a href="/meteo/regions.html"> 7 en m&eacute;tropole</a> et <a href="/meteo/monde.html">4 outre-mer,</a>  jouent un r&ocirc;le essentiel dans le relais des informations et l'adaptation des pr&eacute;visions.
</DL>
<P>
A cette structure s'ajoutent des centres sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;s comme :
<DL>
<DD><LI><a href="/meteo/lannion.html"> le Centre de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie Spatiale</a>
<DD><LI><a href="http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr:8000/plaquette/cen.html"> le Centre d'&eacute;tudes de la Neige</a>
<DD><LI><a href="http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr:8000/plaquette/cmm.html"> le Centre de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie Marine</a>
<DD><LI><a href="http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr:8000/plaquette/cam.html"> le Centre d'Aviation M&eacute;t&eacute;orologique</a>
</DL>
Les services op&eacute;rationnels sont soutenus par les services techniques suivants : 
<DL>
<DD><LI><a href="http://www.enm.meteo.fr/">Ecole (ENM)</a>
<DD><LI><a href="http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr:8000/">Recherche (CNRM)</a>

<H2>Les satellites m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques </H2>
La m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie a &eacute;t&eacute; un des tous premiers domaines d'action des 
satellites.On voyait enfin, sur de vastes &eacute;tendues, ce que l'on ne savait qu'imaginer ou 
reconstituer, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; ces satellites &agrave; basse altitude, dits encore d&eacute;filants. 
Mais ils ne passaient que deux fois par jour. Une deuxi&egrave;me r&eacute;volution a 
&eacute;t&eacute; l'apparition des g&eacute;ostationnaires qui ont permis une surveillance continue 
(toutes les 30mn pour METEOSAT actuel) de l'atmosph&egrave;re dans leur champ devenu fixe. Les 
deux familles de satellites participent, avec un poids devenu tr&egrave;s important, &agrave; 
l'information du pr&eacute;visionniste soit au travers des mod&egrave;les num&eacute;riques (vents 
obtenus &agrave; partir de d&eacute;placements mesur&eacute;s sur l'imagerie 
g&eacute;ostationnaire, capacit&eacute; "sondage" des d&eacute;filants), soit plus directement et plus 
rapidement (en tout premier lieu animation des g&eacute;ostationnaires). Les positions des 
g&eacute;ostationnaires m&eacute;t&eacute;os sont r&eacute;parties mondialement, l'Europe tenant 
la place 0 de longitude avec METEOSAT.
<P>
<h3>Derni&egrave;res images re&ccedil;ues de METEOSAT 5 :</h3>
L'&eacute;chantillonnage pr&eacute;sent&eacute; correspond aux heures dites synoptiques 
principales (00,06,12,18 <a href="#UTC">UTC</a>). Les images sont r&eacute;actualis&eacute;es sur 
ce serveur environ 30mn apr&egrave;s le balayage initial par l'imageur.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="images/picto001b.gif">
<I>La montagne est fr&eacute;quent&eacute;e par un nombre croissant d'amateurs &agrave; la recherche d'air 
pur, de d&eacute;tente, de grands espaces, de plaisirs esth&eacute;tiques ou sportifs. Jadis, elle 
constituait essentiellement le domaine des pionniers de l'alpinisme. Aujourd'hui, 
elle est de plus en plus parcourue par des randonneurs p&eacute;destres ou skieurs, des cavaliers, 
des amateurs de VTT, de vol libre, d'activit&eacute;s en eaux vives ou d'exploration souterraine.<BR><BR>
Cette grande fr&eacute;quentation peut engendrer un sentiment trompeur de s&eacute;curit&eacute;. La montagne 
n'est pas un espace de loisirs organis&eacute;, banalis&eacute; et s&eacute;curis&eacute;. Toutes ces activit&eacute;s 
de plein air se pratiquent dans un milieu naturel &eacute;volutif &quot;&agrave; risque&quot; qui se caract&eacute;rise par la pr&eacute;sence de pentes fortes, de terrains instables, etc. Dans ce milieu, 
les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques &eacute;voluent tr&egrave;s vite et souvent avec violence. La m&eacute;connaissance 
de leurs effets peut entra&icirc;ner des cons&eacute;quences parfois dramatiques.<BR><BR>
A un bon &eacute;quipement, &agrave; une bonne connaissance th&eacute;orique et pratique des techniques 
propres &agrave; chaque discipline, doit s'ajouter une prise en compte judicieuse et syst&eacute;matique 
des conditions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques pass&eacute;es, pr&eacute;sentes et &agrave; venir. C'est un facteur de 
s&eacute;curit&eacute; ainsi qu'un &eacute;l&eacute;ment suppl&eacute;mentaire de confort et d'agr&eacute;ment.</I><BR CLEAR=LEFT><HR>

Elle a &eacute;t&eacute; compos&eacute;e &agrave; partir des mesures de rayonnement de grande longueur d'onde (infrarouge) effectu&eacute;es par le satellite g&eacute;ostationnaire europ&eacute;en <I>M&eacute;t&eacute;osat</I>. Ce rayonnement qui provient de la Terre ou de l'atmosph&egrave;re est d'autant plus intense que la surface &eacute;mettrice (surface terrestre ou sommet d'un nuage) est chaude. Sur ce genre d'image, les <a href="http://www.meteo.fr/connaitre/nuages.html">nuages</a> &eacute;lev&eacute;s, donc froids, apparaissent en blanc. Les <a href="http://www.meteo.fr/connaitre/nuages.html">nuages</a> bas, de temp&eacute;rature plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e mais tout de m&ecirc;me inf&eacute;rieure &agrave; celle du sol ou de la mer, apparaissent en gris. La surface terrestre (zone de fort rayonnement) est color&eacute;e en ocre sur terre, en bleu sur mer.

Sur cette illustration, on distingue une masse nuageuse s'enroulant autour d'un minimum de pression dans le golfe de Gascogne. Elle est prolong&eacute;e par un front principal, de la Normandie &agrave; la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e, engendrant de tr&egrave;s nombreux orages, et un front secondaire abordant la c&ocirc;te atlantique. Au sud du Groenland, une perturbation complexe pr&eacute;sente plusieurs fronts. A l'est, les <a href="http://www.meteo.fr/connaitre/nuages.html">nuages</a> &eacute;lev&eacute;s d'une perturbation se distinguent parmi la masse grise des <a href="http://www.meteo.fr/connaitre/nuages.html">nuages</a> bas.

</TD>
<TD >
Cette image est compos&eacute;e &agrave; partir du rayonnement de grande longueur d'onde (infrarouge) parvenant au niveau le plus &eacute;lev&eacute; du mod&egrave;le. 

Dans un mod&egrave;le num&eacute;rique de pr&eacute;vision du temps, le rayonnement est utilis&eacute; dans le bilan thermique pour calculer l'&eacute;volution de la temp&eacute;rature. Sa fonction premi&egrave;re n'est pas de repr&eacute;senter la couche nuageuse mais, comme le fonctionnement du mod&egrave;le est tr&egrave;s proche de la r&eacute;alit&eacute;, il a suffit d'utiliser le m&ecirc;me code de couleur pour obtenir des images de la couche nuageuse tout &agrave; fait comparables &agrave; la r&eacute;alit&eacute; observ&eacute;e. L'image de synth&egrave;se est en tout point conforme &agrave; celle du satellite, &agrave; la diff&eacute;rence pr&egrave;s que l'un mesure le rayonnement r&eacute;el alors que l'autre le calcule et le pr&eacute;voit.

L'image ci-dessus est une pr&eacute;vision &agrave; 48 heures d'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance, &eacute;tablie le 4 ao&ucirc;t au matin et valable le 6 ao&ucirc;t &agrave; 0 h UTC. Elle peut donc &ecirc;tre compar&eacute;e &agrave; l'image observ&eacute;e par le satellite.

On retrouve sur l'image de synth&egrave;se la masse nuageuse du golfe de Gascogne et ses deux fronts, les structures de la perturbation au sud du Groenland, l'axe de <a href="http://www.meteo.fr/connaitre/nuages.html">nuages</a> &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; l'est. Les masses nuageuses li&eacute;es aux reliefs sont &eacute;galement bien repr&eacute;sent&eacute;es (arc alpin, Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es, cha&icirc;ne des monts Atlas, Balkans). 

Bien qu'elles puissent sembler imparfaites au n&eacute;ophyte, les images de synth&egrave;se de ce type constituent un outil extr&ecirc;mement efficace entre les mains des m&eacute;t&eacute;orologistes pour pr&eacute;voir le temps &agrave; 24, 48 ou 72 heures d'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance.

<P>
Le service M&eacute;t&eacute;oM&eacute;dia permet, au moyen d'un terminal Mac Intosh, d'acc&eacute;der aux bases de donn&eacute;es de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France pour rapatrier, via une liaison sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e ou le r&eacute;seau Num&eacute;ris de France-Telecom, toutes les informations n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; la pr&eacute;paration d'un bulletin t&eacute;l&eacute;vis&eacute;. Le terminal permet de pr&eacute;parer des 
animations d'images satellitales, d'images pr&eacute;vues, d'images radar ou d'impact de foudre. Il permet aussi la 
g&eacute;n&eacute;ration automatique de cartes de pictogrammes. Il permet enfin de les router sur un support vid&eacute;o de qualit&eacute; 
broadcast.

<HR>

Dans la continuit de 1994, l'anne <font size="+2"> 1995 </font> aura encore t douce puisque la temprature moyenne qui varie de l'ordre de 10C dans le Nord-Est jusqu' 16  17C dans le Sud-Est et en Corse, est partout suprieure  la normale. Alors que dans l'extrme Sud-Est, en Corse et sur les Pyrnes-Orientales elle est trs faiblement excdentaire, sur le reste du pays elle est excdentaire de plus de 1C et jusqu' 1,6C dans la rgion de Bordeaux.<P>

En liaison avec cette douceur, on enregistre un nombre de jours avec <B>temprature maximale</B> suprieure ou gale  30C largement excdentaire sur la majeure partie de l'Hexagone except l'extrme Sud-Est, la Corse et aux pieds des Pyrnes proches de la normale. De mme, le nombre de jours avec gel sous abri est nettement dficitaire (gnralement d'environ 10 jours) sur l'ensemble de la France  l'exception des mmes zones que ci-dessus qui restent proches de la normale.<P>

<B>Les hauteurs de prcipitations</B> varient de 328,9 mm en Corse  2013,6 mm  Morteau (Doubs). On n'enregistre pas de gros carts par rapport  la normale puisque le rapport  la normale varie de 50,1%  Hyres-Le-Levant  186,5% dans les Bouches-du-Rhne. Il est de l'ordre de 100  120% sur la majeure partie de la France et lgrement dficitaire sur les ctes de la Manche et de la mer du Nord, la rgion de Bordeaux, aux pieds des Pyrnes, sur le Massif central et en Corse.<P>

<B>Le nombre de jours avec prcipitations</B> suprieures ou gales  un millimtre varie de 46  Ste  172  Le Hohwald (Bas-Rhin). Il est dficitaire sur le Nord-Est, le pimont pyrnen et sur les ctes de la Manche et de la mer du Nord; le dficit maximal est enregistr  Boulogne-sur-Mer avec -20 jours. Ailleurs, ce nombre de jours avec prcipitations est excdentaire d'environ 4 jours avec un maximum de 17 jours  Bourg-Saint-Maurice.<P>

L'anne 1995 n'aura pas t trs orageuse puisque le <B>nombre de jours avec orage</B> reste proche de la normale sur la majeure partie de l'Hexagone et assez fortement dficitaire sur le Sud-Ouest.<P>

En relation avec la douceur, on enregistre un dficit quasi gnral du <B>nombre de jours avec chute de neige</B> en plaine  l'exception de la rgion de Besanon excdentaire de 8 jours.<P>

<B>La dure d'insolation</B> varie de 1506 heures  Charleville-Mzires  2862 heures  Toulon. Elle est suprieure  2000 heures sur le sud de la France.<P>

<B>Le nombre de jours avec brouillard</B> ne s'est que trs peu cart de la normale au cours de cette anne.<P>

En ce qui concerne <B>le vent</B>, le nombre de jours avec vent maximal instantan suprieur ou gal  16 m/s est assez fortement excdentaire partout.

<H2>Constitution des nuages</H2>
Les nuages sont constitu&eacute;s de tr&egrave;s petites gouttelettes d'eau ou de cristaux de glace (1 &agrave; 
100 microns de diam&egrave;tre). Ces &eacute;l&eacute;ments sont dus &agrave; la condensation obtenue 
notamment par d&eacute;tente de la vapeur invisible toujours contenue dans l'atmosph&egrave;re autour de 
minuscules impuret&eacute;s appel&eacute;es noyaux de condensation (cristaux de sel marin, pollens, 
produits polluants).<BR>
Les gouttelettes et cristaux ont une vie dans le nuage; ils peuvent s'&eacute;vaporer et se reformer. Leur 
vitesse de chute, de l'ordre du millim&egrave;tre par seconde, est imperceptible au sein de l'agitation de l'air 
nuageux. La quantit&eacute; d'eau condens&eacute;e (visible) est faible, de l'ordre du gramme par 
m&egrave;tre cube d'air, et ne repr&eacute;sente qu'une faible partie de l'eau atmosph&eacute;rique, le reste 
&eacute;tant constitu&eacute; par la vapeur d'eau (invisible) pr&eacute;sente dans le nuage.<BR>
Ces quantit&eacute;s ne peuvent para&icirc;tre consid&eacute;rables qu'en prenant en compte les importantes 
extensions verticales et surtout horizontales des nuages.


<H2>Les pr&eacute;cipitations</H2>
Sauf dans des cas exceptionnels comme ceux des nuages de grande dimension verticale (<A 
HREF="cumulonimbus.html">cumulonimbus</A> d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s) le nuage ne se vide pas pour 
donner de la pluie ou de la neige. Il doit &ecirc;tre aliment&eacute; en vapeur d'eau susceptible de se 
condenser par des courants a&eacute;riens appropri&eacute;s, et il joue seulement le r&ocirc;le de 
"catalyseur" de la transformation de cette vapeur en neige ou en pluie. La coexistence dans le nuage de cris taux 
de glace et de gouttelettes d'eau surfondues (sous forme liquide &agrave; des temp&eacute;ratures de -10  
&agrave; -30 ) joue un r&ocirc;le essentiel dans le m&eacute;canisme.<BR>
La gr&ecirc;le r&eacute;sulte, au sein des <A HREF="cumulonimbus.html">cumulonimbus</A>, du brassage 
continuel des gouttes d'eau vers le bas puis vers le haut du nuage, sous l'action de courants verticaux violents 
pouvant atteindre 10 &agrave; 30 m/s. En se chargeant continuellement de nouvelles gouttes d'eau, parfois 
surfondues et dont la cong&eacute;lation peut n'&ecirc;tre que partielle, les gr&ecirc;lons parviennent 
&agrave; atteindre une taille et un poids consid&eacute;rables et n'ont pas le temps de fondre avant de toucher 
le sol. Exceptionnellement le diam&egrave;tre des gr&ecirc;lons peut atteindre 6 cm. On a d&eacute;j&agrave; 
observ&eacute; des gr&ecirc;lons de 1 kg.<BR>
Ces gouttes tombent plus rapidement et grossissent par coalescence, c'est-&agrave;-c!ire par rencontre. Les 
vitesses de chute de tr&egrave;s grosses gouttes peuvent atteindre 8 m/s. La goutte poss&egrave;de alors sa 
dimension maximale. Elle se d&eacute;forme et se brise alors en gouttelettes plus petites qui grossissent 
&agrave; leur tour.


<H2>Aspect des nuages</H2>
L'aspect d'un nuage, c'est-&agrave;-dire sa forme, sa texture, sa transparence, son opacit&eacute;, ses couleurs, 
d&eacute;pend:<BR>
d'une part, de la nature et de la densit&eacute; de ses constituants. Les contours tranch&eacute;s indiquent en 
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral la pr&eacute;sence de gros &eacute;l&eacute;ments, la transparence est l'indice d'un 
contenu en mati&egrave;re condens&eacute;e faible; I'opacit&eacute; caract&eacute;rise l'&eacute;paisseur du 
nuage, une structure fibreuse et diaphane est le fait de fins cristaux de glace.<BR>
d'autre part, de la configuration des mouvements atmosph&eacute;riques au sein du nuage, qui eux-
m&ecirc;mes sont tributaires de la stabilit&eacute; de l'atmosph&egrave;re.<BR>
Une atmosph&egrave;re stable ne permet que des mouvements horizontaux, les formes nuageuses sont 
&eacute;tal&eacute;es; une atmosph&egrave;re instable autorise les mouvements verticaux qui 
entra&icirc;nent les formes globulaires.<BR>
et enfin de l'&eacute;clairage auquel le nuage est soumis: &eacute;clairage direct par un soleil plus ou moins 
bas sur l'horizon, &eacute;clairage diffus&eacute; par d'autres &eacute;l&eacute;ments nuageux, diffusion de 
l'air atmosph&eacute;rique ou r&eacute;flexion s&eacute;lective du sol. Les positions relatives de 
l'observateur, du nuage et des sources &eacute;clairantes ont un r&ocirc;le essentiel.<BR>
La coloration des nuages ne d&eacute;pend pas de propri&eacute;t&eacute;s sp&eacute;cifiques des 
&eacute;l&eacute;ments du nuage. Les colorations cuivr&eacute;es sont dues &agrave; des &eacute;clairages 
d&eacute;pouill&eacute;s des radiations absorb&eacute;es par la diffusion atmosph&eacute;rique; les teintes 
bleut&eacute;es sont dues au contraire, soit &agrave; un &eacute;clairage diffus&eacute;, soit, pour les nuages 
lointains, &agrave; la contribution de la lumi&egrave;re re&ccedil;ue par diffusion de la tranche 
d'atmosph&egrave;re situ&eacute;e entre l'observateur et le nuage.

<H2>Les 10 genres de nuages</H2>
Bien que les nuages soient en perp&eacute;tuelle &eacute;volution, on a pu d&eacute;finir un nombre 
limit&eacute; de formes caract&eacute;ristiques permettant de les classer en diff&eacute;rents groupes. La 
classification des nuages expos&eacute;e dans "l'Atlas International des Nuages" est bas&eacute;e sur 
l'existence de dix groupes principaux, appel&eacute;s ''genres'', qui s'excluent mutuellement mais comportent 
des subdivisions en ''esp&egrave;ces'' et en ''vari&eacute;t&eacute;s'', parfois communes d'un genre &agrave; 
l'autre.<BR>
Chacun des divers processus de formation imprime des formes propres et se trouve ainsi indirectement pris en 
consid&eacute;ration dans la classification. Il en est de m&ecirc;me pour l'altitude.<BR>
L'altitude d'un genre nuageux est fortement influenc&eacute;e par la structure thermique de 
l'atmosph&egrave;re. Elle varie donc avec la latitude, la saison, la situation m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique et 
m&ecirc;me l'heure de la journ&eacute;e, mais l'&eacute;tagement relatif des diff&eacute;rents genres est 
immuable.<BR>
Les nuages les plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s, qui occupent l'&eacute;tage sup&eacute;rieur de la 
troposph&egrave;re sont constitu&eacute;s de cristaux de glace (pr&eacute;fixe: Cirr ou Cirro) et 
comprennent les genres <A HREF="cirrus.html">Cirrus</A>, <A 
HREF="cirrocumulus.html">Cirrocumulus</A> et <A HREF="cirrostratus.html">Cirrostratus</A>.<BR>
Ceux de l'&eacute;tage moyen (pr&eacute;fixe: Alto), g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement constitu&eacute;s de 
gouttelettes d'eau, parfois de cristaux de glace, comprennent les <A 
HREF="altocumulus.html">Altocumulus</A> et <A HREF="altostratus.html">Altostratus</A>, et le <A 
HREF="nimbostratus.html">Nimbostratus</A>. L'<A HREF="altostratus.html">Altostratus</A> peut 
p&eacute;n&eacute;trer dans l'&eacute;tage sup&eacute;rieur; le <A 
HREF="nimbostratus.html">Nimbostratus</A> d&eacute;borde g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement dans les 
&eacute;tages sup&eacute;rieur et inf&eacute;rieur.<BR>
A l'&eacute;tage inf&eacute;rieur, on trouve les genres <A HREF="stratocumulus.html">Stratocumulus</A> 
et <A HREF="stratus.html">Stratus</A>, nuages bas.<BR>
Deux genres, enfin, les <A HREF="cumulus.html">Cumulus</A> et <A 
HREF="cumulonimbus.html">Cumulonimbus</A>, nuages d'instabilit&eacute;, qui ont 
g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement leur base dans l'&eacute;tage inf&eacute;rieur, peuvent s'&eacute;tendre 
&agrave; travers les deux autres &eacute;tages. Ils se pr&eacute;sentent en &eacute;l&eacute;ments 
s&eacute;par&eacute;s, ayant l'aspect de monceaux, de montagnes ou de tours dont l'extension verticale peut 
&ecirc;tre comparable &agrave; l'extension horizontale.<BR>
La majeure partie de la masse de ces nuages est constitu&eacute;e de gouttelettes d'eau, tandis que la partie 
sup&eacute;rieure des <A HREF="cumulonimbus.html">Cumulonimbus</A> et de certains <A 
HREF="cumulus.html">Cumulus</A>, qui peut atteindre 8 &agrave; 13 km d'altitude et parfois bien davantage 
(15 &agrave; 20 km dans les r&eacute;gions tropicales) est form&eacute;e de cristaux de glace.<BR>
Les divers genres de nuages comportent des esp&egrave;ces et des vari&eacute;t&eacute;s qui correspondent 
&agrave; des particularit&eacute;s ou &agrave; des aspects caract&eacute;ristiques: fibratus (fibreux), 
undulatus (d'aspect ondul&eacute;), opacus (opaque) etc. . .<BR>

<CENTER><H2>1994, ann&eacute;e exceptionnellement douce dans le Nord-Est</H2></CENTER>
<i>Dans la r&eacute;gion Nord-Est, </i><font size="+2"> 1994 </font><i> a &eacute;t&eacute; l'ann&eacute;e la plus chaude du si&egrave;cle. Cette douceur, remarquable sur la Lorraine, l'Alsace et la Franche-Comt&eacute;, a concern&eacute; l'ensemble de la France et, plus g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement, l'Europe occidentale.</i>
<P>
Les temp&eacute;ratures minimales annuelles de la r&eacute;gion ont &eacute;t&eacute; sup&eacute;rieures de 2 &agrave; 3 degr&eacute;s aux valeurs normales et ont battu tous les records de douceur depuis 1949, d&eacute;but des fichiers informatis&eacute;s &agrave; M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France, et m&ecirc;me depuis la fin du si&egrave;cle dernier si l'on se r&eacute;f&egrave;re aux archives centenaires de Besan&ccedil;on. Le nombre de jours de gel a &eacute;t&eacute; particuli&egrave;rement faible : &agrave; Strasbourg, on a enregistr&eacute; 35 jours de gel au lieu des 76 que l'on compte habituellement sur l'ann&eacute;e. Les temp&eacute;ratures maximales annuelles, sup&eacute;rieures de 1 &agrave; 2 degr&eacute;s aux valeurs normales, figurent &eacute;galement parmi les plus chaudes de ces derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies.
<P>
Ces moyennes exceptionnelles ont &eacute;t&eacute; le fait de la succession d'un hiver doux, d'une canicule estivale et d'une fin d'ann&eacute;e particuli&egrave;rement chaude. En dehors d'un mois d'avril normal et d'un mois d'octobre plus froid que la normale, tous les mois de l'ann&eacute;e ont pr&eacute;sent&eacute; des temp&eacute;ratures plus &eacute;lev&eacute;es que les valeurs normales. Paradoxalement, ces temp&eacute;ratures &eacute;lev&eacute;es ont &eacute;t&eacute; accompagn&eacute;es d'un ensoleillement tr&egrave;s m&eacute;diocre et de pr&eacute;cipitations l&eacute;g&egrave;rement plus abondantes que la normale.
<P>
La douceur de cette ann&eacute;e est essentiellement due &agrave; une remont&eacute;e plus persistante et plus puissante que d'habitude des hautes pressions de l'anticyclone des A&ccedil;ores, qui ont prot&eacute;g&eacute; l'Europe occidentale des descentes d'air polaire et plac&eacute; la r&eacute;gions sous l'influence d'un flux d'air chaud en altitude.

Le temps qu'il fait &agrave; un endroit et &agrave; un moment donn&eacute;s (vent, temp&eacute;rature, n&eacute;bulosit&eacute;, quantit&eacute; de pluie,...) d&eacute;pend de l'&eacute;tat dynamique, thermique et hygrom&eacute;trique du fluide atmosph&eacute;rique qui se trouve aux alentours et au-dessus de ce lieu. Il y a du vent si cette parcelle de fluide est le si&egrave;ge de mouvements rapides, il fait chaud si elle provient des r&eacute;gions tropicales, le ciel est nuageux si certaines des couches horizontales qui la composent sont satur&eacute;es en humidit&eacute; et charg&eacute;es de gouttelettes d'eau,... Pr&eacute;voir le temps &agrave; cet endroit revient donc &agrave; d&eacute;terminer &agrave; l'avance l'&eacute;tat d'un ensemble d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments homog&egrave;nes de cette parcelle, chacun de ces &eacute;l&eacute;ments &eacute;tant caract&eacute;ris&eacute; par un petit nombre de variables physiques telles que la pression, la temp&eacute;rature, l'humidit&eacute;, le vent, la teneur en eau liquide,...
<P>
L'&eacute;volution du fluide atmosph&eacute;rique, soumis &agrave; des forces externes (pesanteur, force de Coriolis due &agrave; la rotation de la Terre, frottement) et internes (diff&eacute;rences de pression, force d'Archim&egrave;de), ob&eacute;it aux lois physiques de conservation de la masse, de l'&eacute;nergie et de la quantit&eacute; de mouvement. Ces lois permettent en th&eacute;orie de pr&eacute;voir la mani&egrave;re dont va &eacute;voluer le fluide si l'on conna&icirc;t son &eacute;tat &agrave; un instant initial, de la m&ecirc;me fa&ccedil;on que l'on peut pr&eacute;voir l'heure d'arriv&eacute;e d'un train si l'on conna&icirc;t son heure de d&eacute;part, sa vitesse et la longueur du trajet qu'il a &agrave; parcourir. Les choses sont tout de m&ecirc;me un peu plus compliqu&eacute;es pour l'atmosph&egrave;re !</I>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>La simulation num&eacute;rique</H2>
La simulation num&eacute;rique est le principal outil employ&eacute; par les m&eacute;t&eacute;orologistes pour pr&eacute;voir l'&eacute;volution de l'atmosph&egrave;re, et donc le temps qu'il va faire. Elle proc&egrave;de en plusieurs &eacute;tapes :
<P><DL>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 SRC="/connaitre/images/boite.gif">
<DD>1- On divise l'atmosph&egrave;re en un grand nombre de boites &eacute;l&eacute;mentaires, correspondant aux &eacute;l&eacute;ments homog&egrave;nes dont il a &eacute;t&eacute; question plus haut. Typiquement, les dimensions de ces bo&icirc;tes sont d'une dizaine &agrave; une centaine de kilom&egrave;tres horizontalement, et de quelques centaines de m&egrave;tres verticalement. <P>
<DD>2- Les observations m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques effectu&eacute;es en permanence et dans le monde entier permettent de conna&icirc;tre, de fa&ccedil;on approch&eacute;e, l'&eacute;tat initial du fluide, ou encore les valeurs initiales des variables pression, temp&eacute;rature, vent,... dans chacune des bo&icirc;tes &eacute;l&eacute;mentaires. 
<P>
<DD>3- Les lois physiques de conservation sont d'abord traduites en &eacute;quations math&eacute;matiques, puis num&eacute;ris&eacute;es pour pouvoir &ecirc;tre appliqu&eacute;es aux variables &agrave; l'aide d'un ordinateur. On aboutit ainsi &agrave; un logiciel extr&ecirc;mement complexe appel&eacute; <a href="/connaitre/arpege.html">mod&egrave;le num&eacute;rique de pr&eacute;vision</a>, qui va permettre de calculer pas &agrave; pas l'&eacute;volution dans chacune des bo&icirc;tes &eacute;l&eacute;mentaires.
<P>
<DD>4- A la fin du calcul, le mod&egrave;le donne les nouvelles valeurs des variables pression, temp&eacute;rature, vent,... dans chacune des bo&icirc;tes. Ces valeurs peuvent &ecirc;tre pr&eacute;vues par <a href="/connaitre/arpege.html">les mod&egrave;les actuels</A> &agrave; des &eacute;ch&eacute;ances allant de 6 heures environ (pr&eacute;vision &agrave; tr&egrave;s courte &eacute;ch&eacute;ance) &agrave; 5 jours &agrave; peu pr&egrave;s (pr&eacute;vision &agrave; moyenne &eacute;ch&eacute;ance). Au-del&agrave; de 5 jours, l'imperfection des mesures, les impr&eacute;cisions contenues dans le mod&egrave;le de pr&eacute;vision, et la structure m&ecirc;me de l'atmosph&egrave;re rendent les r&eacute;sultats de la simulation trop hasardeux pour &ecirc;tre utilisables. Ces 5 jours constituent la limite actuelle de fiabilit&eacute; des pr&eacute;visions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques ; c'est pourquoi les Services m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques nationaux, comme M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France, se gardent bien de diffuser des pr&eacute;visions &agrave; plus long terme.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<P>
</DL>
Le processus de pr&eacute;vision du temps ne s'ach&egrave;ve pas avec la simulation num&eacute;rique. Le sp&eacute;cialiste charg&eacute; de la pr&eacute;vision, fort de sa connaissance du climat r&eacute;gional et des limites des mod&egrave;les, ajuste, voire modifie, les r&eacute;sultats de la simulation et les traduit en termes de temps observable, comme la dur&eacute;e et l'intensit&eacute; des pr&eacute;cipitations, les temp&eacute;ratures minimale et maximale du jour, la possible occurrence de brouillards, d'orages ou de rafales de vent. Cette expertise humaine est indispensable pour obtenir <a href="/tpsreel/bulletin.html">une pr&eacute;vision</a> correcte du temps, surtout pour les &eacute;ch&eacute;ances les plus br&egrave;ves (de quelques heures &agrave; un ou deux jours).

<I>Ever since operational meteorology began, M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France public meteorological service has been dedicated to the design, developement, implementation and maintenance of all systems and procedures required for weather forecasting. To this end, it has build up expertise in a wide range of scientific and technical fields, developed ultra-powerful computer models, and established a direct observation network covering France and beyond. <BR> The weather knows no frontiers. M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France therefore plays an active part in the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Such participation enables it to enhance its skills through exchange of information and involvement in major international research projects on atmospheric phenomena. <BR>
M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France's knowhow and technical expertise make it a world leader in all aspects of meteorology.</I>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=40% NOSHADE><P>
<i>The rapid growth of operational meteorology since the end of the 1960s has gone hand in hand with the development of techniques using scientific knowledge gained in a wide variety of fields. The complexity and global nature of the atmosphere call for a rigourous scientif approach.<BR>
Modern meteorology makes use of a whole spectrum of disciplines, including instrumentation, telecommunications, data processing, numerical analysis, remote sensing from the ground and from space, atmospheric physics, fluid mechanics, etc. Weather forecasting and - beyond that - prediction of climate change are based first of all on the availability of powerful observation systems around the world. Next comes the knowhow to analyse observations and to convert them into numerical data for short, medium and long range forecasts. Finally, forecasts have to be adapted to each user category, and made available as appropriate.<BR>
This professional expertise covering many fields has but one aim - that of serving people's daily lives and their economic activities.<BR>
Since its foundation more than a century ago, M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France (as the French national meteorological service was re-named in 1994) has had the primary mission of safeguarding people and property. It has equipped itself with the tools needed to satisfy the requirements and the ethical standards of public service, whilst developing forecasting procedures adapted to various economic activities.</i>

<H2>Meteorological satellites</H2>
To make a forecast, numeric models and forecasters needs to know an initial state of the atmosphere. This state is defined with observations of the atmosphere. <b>The meteorological satellites</b>  contribute to <b>the real time observation,</b> such as ground observations, vertical reading by sounding balloon, etc...

<I>A d&eacute;faut de pouvoir ma&icirc;triser le temps et le climat, l'homme a besoin de les pr&eacute;voir de 
fa&ccedil;on de plus en plus pr&eacute;cise, non seulement pour assurer sa s&eacute;curit&eacute;, mais aussi 
pour rentabiliser ses activit&eacute;s et pr&eacute;server son environnement. A&eacute;ronautique, transports 
maritimes, transports terrestres, agriculture, tourisme, industrie, travaux publics, etc. : aucun secteur 
&eacute;conomique ne peut se passer de la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie. Les enjeux sont tels que chaque pays a 
besoin d'un organisme de haut niveau et ind&eacute;pendant pour mettre en oeuvre les moyens de la

biens</A></H2>
Temp&ecirc;tes, brouillards, gel&eacute;es, ouragans, pr&eacute;cipitations diluviennes, avalanches : la natures 
a ses exc&egrave;s dont l'homme sait seulement limiter les effets. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la pr&eacute;vision 
m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique, mission premi&egrave;re de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France, la 
s&eacute;curit&eacute; des personnes et des biens impose une surveillance permanente de l'atmosph&egrave;re, 
de l'oc&eacute;an superficiel et du manteau neigeux, afin d'en pr&eacute;voir les &eacute;volutions. 
M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France est avant tout au service de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; civile, de la 
pr&eacute;vention des catastrophes naturelles, de la d&eacute;fense nationale et de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; 
a&eacute;ronautique. Les comp&eacute;tences et les moyens dont il dispose sont &agrave; la hauteur de cet 
enjeu : &agrave; la pointe des connaissances scientifiques et techniques, d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s sur tout le 
territoire m&eacute;tropolitain et Outre-mer.<BR>
D&eacute;terminante pour alerter les autorit&eacute;s et la population sur les risques 
m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques imminents et leur gravit&eacute;, cette expertise est de plus en plus 
sollicit&eacute;e &agrave; titre pr&eacute;ventif, dans les &eacute;tudes d'impact pr&eacute;alables &agrave; 
toute implantation de zone d'habitation, de site industriel ou touristique.<P><BR>
<H2><A NAME="RENV002">Acteur de la vie &eacute;conomique</A></H2>
Contribuer au d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique et &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration de la qualit&eacute; 
de la vie en r&eacute;pondant aux besoins des diff&eacute;rents secteurs d'activit&eacute; fait partie des 
missions de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France. Ses comp&eacute;tences et ses moyens sont employ&eacute;s 
&agrave; d&eacute;velopper des services adapt&eacute;s &agrave; chaque secteur &eacute;conomique. Enjeux 
de la qualit&eacute; des pr&eacute;visions et des &eacute;tudes sp&eacute;cifiques : des &eacute;conomies pour 
la collectivit&eacute; et les usagers concern&eacute;s, des gains de productivit&eacute;, une meilleure 
rentabilit&eacute;.<BR>
Grand "consommateur" de pr&eacute;visions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques pour sa s&eacute;curit&eacute;, 
l'aviation civile l'est aussi au nom de la rentabilit&eacute;, puisqu'elle emploie les moyens de la 
m&eacute;t&eacute;o pour calculer les routes a&eacute;riennes optimales en fonction des vents &agrave; chaque 
niveau de l'atmosph&egrave;re.<BR>
Moins connus sans doute, mais de plus en plus importants, les besoins en pr&eacute;visions pour les transports 
terrestres. Pr&eacute;cieuses &eacute;galement pour le monde de l'agriculture, des pr&eacute;visions 
ajust&eacute;es &agrave; chaque cas permettent de semer &agrave; la meilleure p&eacute;riode, de mettre en 
place les moyens n&eacute;cessaires pour juguler les effets des gel&eacute;es tardives, d'optimiser l'irrigation et 
les traitements phytosanitaires...<BR>
Les entreprises de travaux publics et de b&acirc;timent ne sauraient davantage se passer de pr&eacute;visions 
pr&eacute;cises du temps pour conduire leurs chantiers. Il en va de m&ecirc;me dans le secteur de 
l'&eacute;nergie, o&ugrave; distributeurs et gros utilisateurs ont besoin de pr&eacute;visions pour ajuster leur 
production et leurs stocks.<BR>
La liste est longue des m&eacute;tiers auxquels M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France apporte un concours 
irrempla&ccedil;able, partout en France m&eacute;tropolitaine et dans les DOM-TOM gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la 
pr&eacute;vision de ses centres d&eacute;partementaux.<P><BR>

d&eacute;finir les emplacements de sites industriels, pour pr&eacute;voir les &eacute;pisodes de pollution 
urbaine, mais aussi pour anticiper l'incidence de nos modes de vie sur le climat du futur. Le probl&egrave;me de 
la destruction de la couche d'ozone stratosph&eacute;rique est exemplaire :<BR>
les recherches et les simulations men&eacute;es par les grands centres d'&eacute;tudes 
m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques et climatiques ont permis de mesurer les risques engendr&eacute;s par 
l'utilisation massive de chlorofluorocarbones, ce qui a permis aux autorit&eacute;s de mettre en place les mesures

<TITLE>METEO-FRANCE : LA MISSION DE SERVICE PUBLIC</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<H1><CENTER>La mission de service public impose efficacit&eacute;, qualit&eacute; et permanence<HR 
SIZE=5></CENTER></H1>
<I>Parce que son activit&eacute; est d&eacute;terminante pour la s&eacute;curit&eacute; des personnes et 
des biens, efficacit&eacute; et qualit&eacute; jointes &agrave; la permanence de ses services sont les 
fondements de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France.<BR>
Tr&egrave;s connus du grand public, les bulletins m&eacute;t&eacute;o publi&eacute;s par les m&eacute;dias 
ne repr&eacute;sentent, en r&eacute;alit&eacute;, qu'une faible part du travail des 3 500 personnes qui 
oeuvrent &agrave; l'observation et &agrave; la pr&eacute;vision m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques, ainsi 
qu'&agrave; la diffusion d'informations adapt&eacute;es &agrave; chaque type de besoins. Pour fournir les 
prestations les plus &eacute;labor&eacute;es, au-del&agrave; des moyens techniques, les activit&eacute;s de 
M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France n&eacute;cessitent l'incomparable comp&eacute;tence de ses hommes et de ses 
femmes et leur pr&eacute;sence sur tout le territoire national</I><HR WIDTH=40% 
NOSHADE><BR><BR>
<H2>Qualit&eacute; des moyens</H2>
Pour les besoins de sa mission, M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France doit recourir aux techniques les plus 
performantes et ma&icirc;triser en permanence leur &eacute;volution. Cette obligation l'a conduit &agrave; 
d&eacute;velopper un savoir-faire peu commun dans toutes les disciplines de la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie : 
d&eacute;finition, mise au point et maintenance des appareils de mesure et d'observation, &eacute;laboration 
de mod&egrave;les de pr&eacute;vision &agrave; petite, moyenne et grande &eacute;chelle, traitement 
statistique de milliers de donn&eacute;es...<BR>
Avec une comp&eacute;tence s'&eacute;tendant &agrave; l'ensemble du globe, disposant d'un impressionnant 
r&eacute;seau d'observation, de recherche et d'analyse - dont un centre de calcul parmi les plus puissants du 
monde -, M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France est le seul organisme fran&ccedil;ais qui ma&icirc;trise toute la 
production de l'information de base et son traitement sur le territoire national.<P><BR>
<H2>Efficacit&eacute; des hommes</H2>
Ces atouts sont valoris&eacute;s par son d&eacute;ploiement territorial. Pr&eacute;sents dans tous les 
d&eacute;partements, les hommes de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France sont au contact du terrain pour adapter les 
pr&eacute;visions aux caract&eacute;ristiques et aux besoins locaux, et maximiser le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice 
socio-&eacute;conomique de la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie au profit de tous<P><BR>
<H2>Influence internationale</H2>
Les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques et climatiques ignorent les 
fronti&egrave;res. Depuis longtemps, une coop&eacute;ration internationale a permis de r&eacute;unir les 
moyens mat&eacute;riels et humains des diff&eacute;rents services m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques 
nationaux &agrave; travers le monde. M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France figure parmi les acteurs majeurs de cette 
organisation.<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=5>

<I>H 24 : M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France op&eacute;rationnel nuit et jour</I></H4>
Le temps ignore l'heure. Les imp&eacute;ratifs de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; civile imposent aux 
&eacute;quipes du centre de calcul et aux pr&eacute;visionnistes d'&ecirc;tre op&eacute;rationnels 24 heures 
sur 24, 365 jours par ans.<BR >
Etabli &agrave; Toulouse, le Service Central d'Exploitation de la M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie, coeur de 
M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France, poss&egrave;de un centre de transmission sur lequel transitent toutes les 
informations mondiales, nuit et jour. Des informations qu'il faut analyser, traiter et adapter aux 
diff&eacute;rents besoins.<BR>
Pour affiner encore la pr&eacute;vision, M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France s'appuie sur le r&eacute;seau de ses 
Directions r&eacute;gionales et de ses Centres d&eacute;partementaux.<HR><BR CLEAR=LEFT ><BR>
<H4><I>M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France, acteur international</I></H4>
Figurant parmi les organismes de m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie les plus importants au monde, 
M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France, repr&eacute;sentant officiel de la France, est largement associ&eacute; aux 
programmes et activit&eacute;s de l'Organisation M&eacute;t&eacute;orologique Mondiale (OMM). A ce 
titre, ses responsabilit&eacute;s internationales sont nombreuses : veille m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique 
mondiale, alerte cyclonique, qualit&eacute; m&eacute;trologique et harmonisation des observations, suivi du 
d&eacute;placement des polluants atmosph&eacute;riques, coop&eacute;ration technique internationale. 
M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France occupe &eacute;galement une place importante au sein de Centre 
Europ&eacute;en pour les Pr&eacute;visions M&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques &agrave; Moyen Terme 
(CEPMMT) et dans l'organisation europ&eacute;enne Eumetsat qui g&egrave;re les programmes 
europ&eacute;ens d'observation m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique par satellite. Enfin, M&eacute;t&eacute;o-
France est partie prenante dans de nombreuses coop&eacute;rations bi ou multilat&eacute;rales, notamment 
avec les pays africains, est-europ&eacute;ens et m&eacute;diterran&eacute;ens.<HR><BR

13 000 messages alphanum&eacute;riques et 350 documents graphiques en provenance du monde entier sont 
trait&eacute;s chaque jour par les ordinateurs de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France.<BR>
Connect&eacute; &agrave; tous les centres d'observation de la plan&egrave;te, M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France 
dispose lui-m&ecirc;me de 245 stations d'observation en surface, 23 stations de radiosondage (dont 4 en mer), 
3 087 postes climatologiques, 13 radars en m&eacute;tropole pour la surveillance des pr&eacute;cipitations et 
1 000 stations automatiques. Il b&eacute;n&eacute;ficie d'accords avec 140 navires &eacute;quip&eacute;s

<H1><CENTER>Pour progresser encore, la recherche appliqu&eacute;e et les expertises 
exceptionnelles<HR SIZE=5></CENTER></H1>
<I>Am&eacute;liorer les pr&eacute;visions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques &agrave; court et moyen terme, 
perfectionner les pr&eacute;visions climatiques d&eacute;terminantes pour l'orientation des activit&eacute;s 
de l'humanit&eacute;, tels sont les principaux enjeux de la recherche men&eacute;e par le Centre National de 
Recherches M&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques (<A HREF="http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr:8000/">CNRM</A>) de 
M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France, en collaboration 
&eacute;troite avec les organismes de recherche fondamentale. Ce centre de recherche figure parmi les plus 
importants en Europe et ses chercheurs font partie de la poign&eacute;e de scientifiques de renomm&eacute;e 
internationale.</I><HR NOSHADE WIDTH=40%><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=226 VSPACE=0 HSPACE=10 SRC="/meteo/images/ph07.gif">
Les moyens et actions de recherche de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France sont orient&eacute;s en priorit&eacute; 
vers les besoins du service aux usagers : connaissance de la physique et de la dynamique de 
l'atmosph&egrave;re, pr&eacute;vision, &eacute;tude du climat et de son &eacute;volution, influence des 
activit&eacute;s humaines... Ses domaines d'&eacute;tude s'&eacute;tendent jusqu'aux fronti&egrave;res de la 
m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie : chimie de l'atmosph&egrave;re (pluie acide, ozone), oc&eacute;anographie 
(comportement physique et dynamique des eaux des couches superficielles), &eacute;valuation et 
&eacute;volution du manteau neigeux, hydrologie...<BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
<H2>Mieux conna&icirc;tre les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes &agrave; moyenne &eacute;chelle pour 
am&eacute;liorer la pr&eacute;vision &agrave; court terme</H2>
L'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance de la pr&eacute;vision m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique est repouss&eacute;e en 
moyenne d'une journ&eacute;e tous les cinq ans. Ces gains de pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute; reposent sur 
l'am&eacute;lioration des mod&egrave;les num&eacute;riques, laquelle suppose des observations 
extr&ecirc;mement d&eacute;taill&eacute;es de ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes locaux et de courte 
dur&eacute;e. Depuis plus de dix ans, une unit&eacute; de recherche de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France se 
consacre &agrave; ces travaux, conjuguant ses comp&eacute;tences &agrave; celles des chercheurs du CNRS 
et des Universit&eacute;s, coop&eacute;rant avec des organismes m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques 
&eacute;trangers pour organiser les campagnes d'observation et de mesures.<P><BR>
<H2>Etudier le climat du futur</H2>
Les activit&eacute;s humaines contemporaines vont-elles engendrer des changements climatiques &agrave; 
plus ou moins longue &eacute;ch&eacute;ance ? Et quelle sera l'amplitude de ces derniers par rapport aux 
ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes naturels ? Cette question qui int&eacute;resse l'humanit&eacute; toute 
enti&egrave;re est l'objet de recherches sp&eacute;cifiques &agrave; M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France : 
&eacute;tude des &eacute;changes d'&eacute;nergie entre l'oc&eacute;an et l'atmosph&egrave;re, de l'impact 
de l'augmentation du gaz carbonique, de l'&eacute;volution de l'ozone... D&eacute;riv&eacute;s des 
mod&egrave;les de pr&eacute;vision du temps, les mod&egrave;les num&eacute;riques de pr&eacute;vision du 
climat n&eacute;cessitent la description de processus complexes et la mise en oeuvre d'importantes 
campagnes de mesures. Les sc&eacute;narios d&eacute;coulant de telles &eacute;tudes permettent 
d'&eacute;valuer les incidences sociales et &eacute;conomiques de toute modification du climat.<P><BR>

Concevoir, d&eacute;velopper et entretenir l'ensemble des mod&egrave;les num&eacute;riques

Seule m&eacute;thode scientifique pour pr&eacute;voir l'&eacute;volution du temps au-del&agrave; d'une 
&eacute;ch&eacute;ance de 24 heures, la pr&eacute;vision num&eacute;rique mobilise les moyens les plus 
puissants. M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France dispose d'un centre de calcul parmi les mieux &eacute;quip&eacute;s 
d'Europe. Ses &eacute;quipes pluridisciplinaires de scientifiques d'informaticiens et de pr&eacute;visionnistes 
ont

La qualit&eacute; de la pr&eacute;vision est d'abord li&eacute;e &agrave; la qualit&eacute; des observations et 
des mesures. Outre sa participation active aux efforts nationaux et internationaux en mati&egrave;re de 
m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie exp&eacute;rimentale et instrumentale, M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France s'investit 
dans le d&eacute;veloppement de nouveaux appareils : radar profileur de vent, syst&egrave;me de sondage

pr&eacute;visions g&eacute;n&eacute;rales, le kiosque t&eacute;l&eacute;phonique ajoute &eacute;galement 
des services sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;s (montagne, mer...).<BR>
Le magazine Minitel fournit observations, climatologie et pr&eacute;visions jusqu'&agrave; cinq jours sur la 
France et jusqu'au lendemain sur les Antilles, la R&eacute;union, la Nouvelle-Cal&eacute;donie et l'Europe ; il

<H2>L'information des m&eacute;dias</H2>
Si la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie est &agrave; ce point pr&eacute;sente dans la vie de chaque citoyen, sans

M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France travaille quotidiennement avec la majorit&eacute; des cha&icirc;nes de 
t&eacute;l&eacute;vision et de radio nationales (TF1, France 2, France 3, M6, LCI, RFO, Radio France...), ainsi

<DD>L'&eacute;cole nationale de la M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie fait partie de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France. 
Cr&eacute;&eacute;e dans les ann&eacute;es vingt, elle demeure en France le seul organisme de formation aux 
disciplines de la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie op&eacute;rationnelle. Outre la formation initiale des 
ing&eacute;nieurs et techniciens de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France et la formation permanente de tous les 
agents, elle accueille les futurs m&eacute;t&eacute;orologistes militaires (arm&eacute;es de l'air, de terre et 
marine nationale), dispense des formations sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es en mod&eacute;lisation 
num&eacute;rique et en m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie tropicale, ouvre ses portes &agrave; des 
&eacute;tudiants en provenance de services m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques &eacute;trangers. Elle organise 
&eacute;galement des stages pour les partenaires et les clients de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France.<BR>
La formation au m&eacute;tier d'Ing&eacute;nieur civil de la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie (Bac+7) est ouverte 
directement aux &eacute;l&egrave;ves issus de l'Ecole Polytechnique, des Ecoles Normales 
Sup&eacute;rieures et de l'Institut National Agronomique ; elle est accessible &eacute;galement sur concours 
aux titulaires d'un dipl&ocirc;me d'ing&eacute;nieur ou d'une ma&icirc;trise scientifique.<BR>
Les chefs de centres m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques et la plupart des pr&eacute;visionnistes ont le titre 
d'Ing&eacute;nieur de l'ENM (Bac+5), obtenu, &agrave; l'issue de trois ann&eacute;es de formation, par des 
&eacute;tudiants de niveau math&eacute;matiques sp&eacute;ciales ou titulaire d'une ma&icirc;trise 
scientifique.<BR>

<HEAD><TITLE>METEO-FRANCE : Neptune </TITLE></HEAD> 
 
<BODY> 
<H1><CENTER>NEPTUNE : La m&eacute;t&eacute;o num&eacute;rique accessible &agrave; tous les marins</H1><HR SIZE=5></CENTER> <P>
<i>Pour toutes informations complmentaires, veuillez contacter </i>: <a href="mailto:Philippe.Ladoy@meteo.fr"> Philippe.Ladoy@meteo.fr</a><i> ou </i><a href="mailto:Alan.Villemin@meteo.fr"> Alan.Villemin@meteo.fr</a>
<P>

Le service Neptune permet la r&eacute;ception, &agrave; bord, des informations m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques (donn&eacute;es num&eacute;riques, cartes...) sur une zone de navigation permanente ou mobile.
<P>
<H2>Le lien m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique en mer</H2>
Les donn&eacute;es transitent via le r&eacute;seau de satellites Inmarsat. Elles sont m&eacute;moris&eacute;es, d&eacute;cod&eacute;es et trait&eacute;es sur des terminaux embarqu&eacute;s qui permettent la visualisation des donn&eacute;es sous forme de carte ou des utilisations sp&eacute;cifiques (animations, optimisation de route, routage, alerte...).
<BR>
L'utilisation optimale des informations m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques, observ&eacute;es ou pr&eacute;vues, disponibles &agrave; bord est d&eacute;sormais possible. Neptune est donc un gage de s&eacute;curit&eacute; accrue en mer. Il concerne aussi bien les activit&eacute;s professionnelles que la plaisance.
<H2>Les donn&eacute;es disponibles</H2>
Selon les demandes, Neptune permet de disposer des donn&eacute;es suivantes :<BR>
<DL>
<DD><LI>la <A HREF="/produits/images/pmervent.gif"> pression</a> , le <A HREF="/produits/images/pap.gif">vent</a> (vitesse et direction), la <A HREF="/produits/images/wamglob1.gif">houle</a> (hauteur, direction et p&eacute;riode) ; ces pr&eacute;visions sont fournies avec une r&eacute;solution maximale de 0,5 de longitude, jusqu'&agrave; cinq jours d'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance.<P>
<DD><LI><A HREF="/produits/images/preiso72.gif">la carte des "fronts et isobares",</A> analyse et pr&eacute;visions jusqu'&agrave; trois jours d'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance.<P>
<DD><LI><A HREF="/produits/images/tmer.gif">les observations de temp&eacute;rature superficielle de la mer.</A>
</DL>
Ces donn&eacute;es sont issues des mod&egrave;les de pr&eacute;vision num&eacute;riques de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France et du centre Europ&eacute;en de Pr&eacute;visions &agrave; Moyen Terme (CEPMMT). Elles sont diffus&eacute;es une fois par jour automatiquement ou sur requ&ecirc;te de l'abonn&eacute;.
<H2>Pour recevoir NEPTUNE</H2>
Il faut :
<DL>
<DD><LI>Etre &eacute;quip&eacute; d'un r&eacute;cepteur Inmarsat-C (antenne et modem);<P>
<DD><LI>Disposer d'un micro-ordinateur (PC ou Macintosh) reli&eacute; au r&eacute;cepteur Inmarsat et pourvu des logiciels de d&eacute;codage, de traitement et visualisation des donn&eacute;es.<P>
<DD><LI>Souscrire un abonnement au service NEPTUNE.<P>
</DL>
<H2>Un service adapt&eacute; aux besoins des marins</H2>
<DL>
<DD><LI>Pour les p&ecirc;cheurs et pour toutes les activit&eacute;s en mer sur site (off-shore, patrouilles, etc.), le service "Neptune-EGC-FleetNET" permet, par abonnement forfaitaire, la r&eacute;ception automatique et quotidienne de neuf cartes m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques : vent, houle (analyse et pr&eacute;visions &agrave; 3 jours) et observations de la temp&eacute;rature superficielle de la mer. Ce service est disponible sur une ou plusieurs des sept zones de navigation d&eacute;finies de l'Islande &agrave; la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e ;<P>
<DD><LI>Pour les navigations hauturi&egrave;res (marine marchande, croisi&egrave;res, courses etc. ...), le service personnalis&eacute; "Neptune-Point-&agrave;-point" permet la r&eacute;ception des donn&eacute;es &agrave; bord selon les demandes de l'abonn&eacute;. Ce service est factur&eacute; au nombre d'appels et n&eacute;cessite l'acceptation pr&eacute;alable d'un devis.<P>
</DL>
<H2> NEPTUNE : une diffusion mondiale</H2>
L'acc&egrave;s M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France aux stations terrestres Inmarsat d'Aussaguel (France-Telecom) et de Perth (Telstra, Australie) assure, 24 heures sur 24, la disponibilit&eacute; de la diffusion mondiale de Neptune (standard-C).

Le Centre de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie Spatiale (CMS) de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France, situ&eacute; &agrave; Lannion, est le centre national pour l'acquisition, le traitement, l'archivage et la distribution des donn&eacute;es re&ccedil;ues des satellites m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques.<BR><BR>
Implant&eacute; &agrave; Lannion depuis 1963 le CMS compte aujourd'hui 80 personnes.<BR><BR>
<A HREF="images/gmeteosat.gif"><IMG HSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/meteosat.gif"></A>
<A HREF="images/gnoaa.gif"><IMG HSPACE=5 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/noaa.gif"></A>
Il re&ccedil;oit les satellites m&eacute;t&eacute;os &agrave; d&eacute;filement <A HREF="images/gnoaa.gif">(NOAA)</A> et g&eacute;ostationnaires (<A HREF="images/gmeteosat.gif">METEOSAT</A> et GOES) dont les donn&eacute;es sont compl&eacute;mentaires.<BR CLEAR=RIGHT><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
Le fonctionnement 24 heures sur 24 du CMS affirme son caract&egrave;re op&eacute;rationnel tr&egrave;s marqu&eacute;.<BR><BR>
<A HREF="images/gtourbillon.gif"><IMG HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/tourbillon.gif"></A>
Les donn&eacute;es brutes qu'il re&ccedil;oit sont transform&eacute;es en produits comme <A HREF="images/gtourbillon.gif">l'imagerie</A>, les temp&eacute;ratures de la mer et des nuages, l'indice de v&eacute;g&eacute;tation, la structure verticale de l'atmosph&egrave;re  La conception de ces produits et la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de les faire &eacute;voluer justifient une activit&eacute; de recherche et d&eacute;veloppement tr&egrave;s d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e.<BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
<A HREF="images/gtempete.gif"><IMG HSPACE=5 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/tempete.gif"></A>
<A HREF="images/gtempemer.gif"><IMG HSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/tempemer.gif"></A>
Par priorit&eacute;, ces produits sont destin&eacute;s aux services op&eacute;rationnels et de recherche de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France mais ils contribuent &eacute;galement &agrave; d'autres applications comme l'aide &agrave; la p&ecirc;che thoni&egrave;re, l'&eacute;laboration de <A HREF="images/gtempemer.gif">cartes de temp&eacute;rature de la mer</A> pour la Marine Nationale, la fourniture d'imagerie aux <A HREF="images/gtempete.gif">t&eacute;l&eacute;visions</A> sans conteste le produit le mieux connu du grand public.<BR CLEAR=RIGHT><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
Unique en France, le CMS remplit &eacute;galement des fonctions sp&eacute;cifiques :
<UL>
<LI>aide au lancement des satellites m&eacute;t&eacute;os d&eacute;filants am&eacute;ricains.<BR>
<LI>relais pour les Am&eacute;ricains d'orbites en dehors de leur zone de r&eacute;ception.<BR>
<LI>fourniture d'imagerie pour les campagnes "cycloniques"<BR>
<LI>intercalibration des divers satellites geostationnaires m&eacute;t&eacute;os.<BR>
<LI>actions de formation sur les activit&eacute;s en M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie Spatiale.<BR></UL>
<A HREF="images/ggoes.gif"><IMG HSPACE=5 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/goes.gif"></A>
Le CMS joue un r&ocirc;le tr&egrave;s important au sein d'EUMETSAT, l'organisation europ&eacute;enne de gestion des satellites m&eacute;t&eacute;os : sa position &agrave; l'extr&ecirc;me Ouest de l'Europe lui permet de recevoir des images des <A HREF="images/ggoes.gif">satellites am&eacute;ricains</A> qu'il rediffuse vers les services m&eacute;t&eacute;os europ&eacute;ens et africains.<BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
Enfin le CMS assure des fonctions d'expertise sur les stations de r&eacute;ception et les 
syst&egrave;mes de satellites futurs : il sera pr&ecirc;t &agrave; recevoir les g&eacute;n&eacute;rations des satellites de l'an 2000.

<H1><CENTER>La pr&eacute;vision num&eacute;rique avec le mod&egrave;le ARPEGE</CENTER></H1>
<HR>
<H2>Le mod&egrave;le ARPEGE</H2>
<i>La pr&eacute;vision m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique repose, pour une large part, sur l'emploi de logiciels de simulation num&eacute;rique de l'atmosph&egrave;re, couramment appel&eacute;s "mod&egrave;les". M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France a mis en service op&eacute;rationnel, le 6 d&eacute;cembre 1993, la version la plus &eacute;volu&eacute;e du nouveau mod&egrave;le </i><b>ARPEGE</b>.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/connaitre/images/arpege.gif"> La principale innovation d'ARPEGE est sa r&eacute;solution horizontale variable : l'atmosph&egrave;re est divis&eacute;e en <a href="/connaitre/images/boite.gif">petites "bo&icirc;tes" &eacute;l&eacute;mentaires</a> dont la dimension horizontale est minimale sur la France, pour cro&icirc;tre progressivement jusqu'aux antipodes o&ugrave; elle est maximales. On peut ainsi, avec un mod&egrave;le unique, r&eacute;aliser des pr&eacute;visions &agrave; &eacute;chelle fine sur le territoire m&eacute;tropolitain tout en d&eacute;crivant avec une pr&eacute;cision suffisante les grands ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle plan&eacute;taire. 
<P>
Le mod&egrave;le ARPEGE fournit deux fois par jour des pr&eacute;visions avec une r&eacute;solution de <b>25 km sur la France et de 300 km aux antipodes</b>.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
Ce nouvel outil num&eacute;rique a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;velopp&eacute; en collaboration &eacute;troite avec le Centre europ&eacute;en pour les pr&eacute;visions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques &agrave; moyen terme. Il a &eacute;t&eacute; con&ccedil;u d&egrave;s l'origine comme multi-usage, permettant aussi bien d'effectuer des pr&eacute;visions &agrave; courte &eacute;ch&eacute;ance, jusqu'&agrave; trois jours, ou &agrave; moyenne &eacute;ch&eacute;ance, de l'ordre de la semaine, que de contribuer &agrave; l'&eacute;tude des fluctuations et de l'&eacute;volution du climat.
<P>
<H2>Le relief  <i>tel qu'il est vu</i> par le mod&egrave;le ARPEGE</H2>
Les animations pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es ci-dessous illustrent le principe de la maille variable, et montrent comment le mod&egrave;le per&ccedil;oit le relief et les contours terrestres sur une maille variable. Au d&eacute;part de chaque animation la densit&eacute; des points de grille est homog&egrave;ne sur la surface terrestre, puis, peu &agrave; peu, cette densit&eacute; augmente sur la France. La repr&eacute;sentation du relief et des contours terrestres devient de plus en plus fine sur la France, et inversement elle diminue aux antipodes. L'image finale de chaque animation correspond &agrave; la maille et la repr&eacute;sentation du relief et des contours terrestres du mod&egrave;le op&eacute;rationnel.<P>

m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie. <BR>
La M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie a pris la succession de l'Annuaire de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; 
m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique de France, la plus ancienne revue de m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie du monde 
(cr&eacute;&eacute;e en 1853).<BR>
La 8e s&eacute;rie de La M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie, cr&eacute;&eacute;e en 1993, se veut 
l'h&eacute;riti&egrave;re de cet illustre pass&eacute;, en publiant en fran&ccedil;ais les articles des meilleurs 
sp&eacute;cialistes.
<H2>Une exigence de qualit&eacute;</H2>

<H2>La montagne, un milieu sp&eacute;cifique.</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Le temps peut changer du tout au tout en l'espace de quelques kilom&egrave;tres &agrave; cause du relief.<BR>
<LI>Les conditions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques &eacute;voluent tr&egrave;s rapidement et les phenom&egrave;nes perturbateurs sont souvent plus violents que ceux rencontr&eacute;s en plaine.<BR>
<LI>Les mauvaises conditions atmosph&eacute;riques augmentent les difficult&eacute;s et cr&eacute;ent des risques suppl&eacute;mentaires.<BR>
<LI>D'excellentes conditions peuvent paradoxalement engendrer d 'autres risques.<BR></UL>
<H2>La pr&eacute;vision m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique : un facteur de confort et de s&eacute;curit&eacute;.</H2>
La pr&eacute;vision m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique anticipe les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes, et permet la diffusion rapide 
des perspectives d'&eacute;volution du temps, mais elle ne ma&icirc;trise pas pour autant tous 
les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes. Elle doit &ecirc;tre bien interpr&eacute;t&eacute;e et utilis&eacute;e en consequence. <BR>
De plus, la connaissance des bulletins m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques et nivologiques doit s'accompagner 
de I'observation personnelle sur le terrain, ce qui demande une bonne experience.<BR><HR><BR>
<CENTER>M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France fournit directement aux pratiquants de la montagne la meilleure information 
m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique possible, r&eacute;actualis&eacute;e plusieurs fois par jour.<BR><BR></CENTER>

<I>La p&eacute;riode de beau temps sec et stable touche &agrave; sa fin. Un front froid, &eacute;tir&eacute; ce soir du Pas-de-Calais au Val de Loire et &agrave; l'Aquitaine, progresse vers l'est. Il atteindra les Alpes demain jeudi en mi-journ&eacute;e. Il y d&eacute;clenchera de violents orages.<BR>
Les hautes pressions se r&eacute;tabliront d&egrave;s vendredi, la fin de la semaine s'annonce belle et chaude.</I><BR><BR>
<H2>Pr&eacute;visions valables sur les Alpes du Nord pour la journ&eacute;e du Jeudi 20 Juillet</H2>
<I>Aggravation !<BR>
Le refroidissement nocturne permettra, une fois encore, un regel mod&eacute;r&eacute; de la neige en haute montagne.<BR>
D&egrave;s les premi&egrave;res heures de la matin&eacute;e, le ciel se chargera de nuages au-dessus de 4 000 m. Les premiers orages pourront &eacute;clater sur les reliefs vers la fin de la matin&eacute;e. Ils se g&eacute;n&eacute;raliseront rapidement par l'ouest &agrave; l'ensemble de la r&eacute;gion. La montagne sera alors &quot;bouch&eacute;e&quot; au-dessus de 1500 m.<BR>
Ces orages, localement violents, accompagn&eacute;s de coups de vent et parfois de gr&ecirc;le, donneront de fortes averses jusqu'en fin de soir&eacute;e. Une baisse accus&eacute;e des temp&eacute;ratures, surtout en montagne, accompagnera les pr&eacute;cipitations (neige &agrave; partir de .3 000 m environ).</I><BR><BR>
<B>Temp&eacute;ratures</B><BR><BR>
<I>En plaine : minimales 14  C - maximales 20  C.<BR>
A 1 000 m : minimales 10 C - maximales 28 C.<BR>
A 2 000 m : minimales 4  C - maximales 12  C.<BR>
Isotherme 0  C : 4 200 m la nuit, s'abaissant &agrave; 3 500 m l'apr&egrave;s-midi.<BR>
Isotherme -10 C : 6000 m la nuit, s'abaissant&agrave; 5 000 nz l'apr&egrave;s-midi.</I><BR><BR>
<B>Vents</B><BR><BR>
<I>Vents &agrave; 3 000 m : SW20 puis 40 km/h le matin, rotation &agrave; NW40/60 km/h dans l'apr&egrave;s-midi.<BR>
Vents &agrave; 5 000 m : SW20 puis 60 km/h le matin, rotation au NW60 km/h dans l'apr&egrave;s-midi.</I><BR><BR>
<H2>Tendance ult&eacute;rieure</H2>
<B>Vendredi :</B><I> ciel le plus souvent tr&egrave;s nuageux &agrave; couvert - &eacute;claircies fugitives, puis belles en plaine - frais.</I><BR>
<B>Samedi et dimanche :</B><I> retour du soleil - quelques nuages l'apr&egrave;s-midi au-dessus du relief - temp&eacute;ratures en hausse.</I><BR>

<B>La l<SUP>re</SUP> partie du message &eacute;voque &agrave; grands traits les conditions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques r&eacute;centes, celles pr&eacute;vues dans les heures &agrave; venir et les jours suivants.<BR></B>
Elle a pour objet de mettre en relief les &eacute;l&eacute;ments moteurs des chan gements en cours ou attendus (ici, le &quot;front froid&quot; et les &quot;hautes pressions&quot;). Elle se veut &eacute;galement p&eacute;dagogique en essayant de faire comprendre comment s'articulent les m&eacute;canismes atmosph&eacute;riques. C'est pourquoi des mots techniques simples sont volontairement utilis&eacute;s.<BR><BR>
<B>La 2<SUP>e</SUP> partie est consacr&eacute;e, dans un langage &quot;grand public &quot; (pas de terme technique) &agrave; la pr&eacute;vision pour les prochaines 24 heures.<BR></B>
C'est le corps du message. Elle met ici en valeur les &eacute;v&eacute;nements propres &agrave; mettre en difficult&eacute;, voire en danger, celui qui se trouve en montagne. En particulier, il est pr&eacute;cis&eacute; que &quot;les premiers orages pourront &eacute;clater vers la fin de la matin&eacute;e&quot;, &agrave; un moment d&eacute;licat o&ugrave; les cord&eacute;es seront encore au sommet ou &agrave; proximit&eacute;, situation &agrave; &eacute;viter absolument.<BR>
Cet ensemble de menaces justifie un titre lapidaire, sans &eacute;quivoque, qui a valeur 
de mise en garde imm&eacute;diate : &quot;Aggravation !&quot;.<BR>
On pr&eacute;cise le vent &agrave; 5 000 m et sa direction d'origine pour les cord&eacute;es qui &eacute;voluent en tr&egrave;s haute montagne (le Mont-Blanc culmine &agrave; 4807m).<BR><BR>
<B>La 3<SUP>e</SUP> partie permet l'organisation d'un emploi du temps &agrave; moyen terme.<BR></B>
Dans ce bulletin, c'est le week-end qui offre les perspectives les plus favorables. 
Mais pour ceux qui partent plusieurs jours, il peut &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute; de mettre &agrave; profit le vendredi pour une marche d'approche. La d&eacute;gradation du beau temps est annonc&eacute;e pour le lundi apr&egrave;s-midi, avec toutes les pr&eacute;cautions requises pour une &eacute;ch&eacute;ance lointaine et donc incertaine.

<H2>Le vent </H2>
En montagne, le vent est souvent sujet &agrave; de brusques changements de direction et de 
force, par suite de courants d'air ascendants, descendants ou rabattants le long 
des parois ou dans les vallons encaiss&eacute;s, sans que ces ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes aient fait l'objet 
de pr&eacute;visions dans les bulletins m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques. Il est d'autant plus dangereux qu'il est 
associ&eacute; &agrave; un autre ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne comme le froid, la pluie ou la neige. En particulier, 
I'action du vent pendant ou apr&egrave;s une chute de neige est &agrave; l'origine d'accumulations 
comme les plaques &agrave; vent, les corniches et les cong&egrave;res, et elle augmente les risques 
d'avalanche. <BR>
<H3>Il peut mettre en danger :</H3>
<UL>
<LI>les adeptes du vol libre (parapente, deltaplane) ;
<LI>les personnes qui progressent en terrain difficile et instable (perte d'&eacute;quilibre, 
chutes de pierres) ;
<LI>d'une mani&egrave;re g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, tous ceux qui passent d'un endroit abrit&eacute; &agrave; un site expos&eacute; 
(cols, cr&ecirc;tes) ;
<LI>les personnes longtemps expos&eacute;es sans protection (car une forte perte calorique 
par convection peut entra&icirc;ner une hypothermie).</UL>
<H2>La pluie </H2>
Sous forme d'averses, la pluie entra&icirc;ne fr&eacute;quemment des mont&eacute;es soudaines du niveau des ruisseaux et torrents, ainsi que des gonflements de cours d'eau souterrains. Persistante, elle peut &ecirc;tre &agrave; l'origine de glissements de terrains et d'&eacute;croulements rocheux.<BR>
La pluie s'accompagne souvent d'un refroidissement. Dans tous les cas, les surfaces 
deviennent glissantes, le franchissement des torrents difficile sinon impossible et les chutes de pierres sont &agrave; craindre.<BR>
De plus, tout refroidissement brusque survenant pendant ou apr&egrave;s une chute de pluie 
peut recouvrir le sol et les parois d'une couche de glace (verglas) ou devenir un 
danger mortel pour une personne dont les v&ecirc;tements sont mouill&eacute;s.<BR>
En hiver, la pluie abondante augmente souvent le risque d'avalanche. <BR>

<H2>La neige </H2>
Les pr&eacute;cipitations neigeuses ont pour premier effet de r&eacute;duire consid&eacute;rablement la 
visibilit&eacute;, entra&icirc;nant g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement la perte des rep&egrave;res visuels. La progression 
devient plus difficile. L'accumulation de neige peut provoquer des avalanches.<BR>
Tout au long de l'ann&eacute;e et m&ecirc;me en &eacute;t&eacute;, un refroidissement peut faire descendre la 
limite de la neige &agrave; basse altitude. Les chutes intervenant hors-saison &quot;pl&acirc;trent&quot; 
la montagne et emp&ecirc;chent souvent toute escalade pendant au minimum trois jours. <BR>

<H2>Le brouillard </H2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="images/picto002.gif">
Le brouillard s'accompagne toujours d'une forte r&eacute;duction de la visibilit&eacute;, de telle 
sorte qu'il peut devenir impossible de s'orienter. Il att&eacute;nue les variations diurnes 
de la temp&eacute;rature, en particulier en moyenne montagne : le jour, lorsqu'il cache 
le soleil, il emp&ecirc;che le r&eacute;chauffement de l'atmosph&egrave;re ; la nuit, il en mod&egrave;re le refroidissement.

et <FONT SIZE=+3>la foudre<FONT SIZE=3></H1>
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><HR SIZE=5><BR>
Les orages en montagne sont relativement fr&eacute;quents. Ils sont &eacute;galement plus surprenants, 
plus violents et plus dangereux qu'en plaine.<BR>
L'orage est en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral annonc&eacute; par des coups de vent avec des courants ascendants tr&egrave;s forts. Il s'accompagne d'averses, de fortes pluies, de neige ou de gr&ecirc;le ainsi que d'un refroidissement. Les turbulences cr&eacute;&eacute;es par le cumulonimbus, nuage g&eacute;n&eacute;rateur des orages, peuvent &ecirc;tre ressenties jusqu'&agrave; plus de 20 km de celui-ci.<BR>
La foudre est le danger majeur : il est tr&egrave;s difficile, en cas d'impact au sol, de se soustraire au risque et les chances de survie lorsque l'on a &eacute;t&eacute; touch&eacute; sont infimes. 
Ses caract&eacute;ristiques &eacute;lectriques sont impressionnantes : hautes temp&eacute;ratures (8 000 
&agrave; 30 000 C), hautes tensions (10 &agrave; 100 millions de volts), fortes intensit&eacute;s (25 000 
amp&egrave;res), temps de contact tr&egrave;s bref (1/1 000 &agrave; 1/10 000 de seconde).
<H2><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="images/troubles_foudre.gif">Manifestations &eacute;lectriques</H2>
Ces manifestations vont engendrer des t&eacute;tanisations, c'est-&agrave;-dire des secousses musculaires 
tant&ocirc;t localis&eacute;es, tant&ocirc;t g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;es, qui peuvent, dans ce dernier cas, projeter 
la victime &agrave; distance et occasionner des traumatismes divers.<BR>
Si, par malheur, le courant rencontre dans son trajet le muscle cardiaque, il y a &eacute;galement t&eacute;tanisation. Le coeur est agit&eacute; de violentes secousses anarchiques. La mort survient rapidement.<BR>
<H2>Manifestations traumatiques</H2>
Certaines sont la cons&eacute;quence de l'explosion provoqu&eacute;e par la brutale mont&eacute;e de temp&eacute;rature 
de la colonne d'air ionis&eacute;e o&ugrave; chemine la foudre. Apparaissent alors des l&eacute;sions de souffle atteignant les organes intra-thoraciques ou intra-abdominaux.<BR>
<H2>Manifestations thermiques</H2>
L'&eacute;clair &eacute;lectrique se propageant le plus souvent &agrave; la surface du corps, les parties les plus humides de la peau sont le si&egrave;ge de br&ucirc;lures superficielles (figures de Lichtenberg) d&eacute;crivant des dessins caract&eacute;ristiques. Les br&ucirc;lures profondes n'apparaissent qu'aux points d'entr&eacute;e et de sortie du courant &eacute;lectrique. Elles peuvent d&eacute;truire les muscles et les tendons. En dehors des manifestations graves, telles que l'arr&ecirc;t cardiaque, on note aussi des l&eacute;sions neurologiques dont les sympt&ocirc;mes sont une perte de conscience, des syncopes ou des paralysies rapidement r&eacute;gressives. Les yeux et les oreilles ne sont pas &eacute;pargn&eacute;s. La rupture du tympan est fr&eacute;quente. La cataracte est une l&eacute;sion courante mais d'apparition retard&eacute;e par rapport &agrave; l'accident initial (quelques semaines ou quelques mois).<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H1><IMG HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">Quelques<BR>conseils<BR>pr&eacute;ventifs<BR CLEAR=LEFT></H1>
<UL>
<LI>Eviter les cr&ecirc;tes
<LI>Si l 'on est surpris sur un sommet, descendre le plus bas et le plus rapidement 
possible en &eacute;vitant d'emprunter les ar&ecirc;tes de la montagne.
<LI>Eloigner de soi toute pi&egrave;ce m&eacute;tallique (piolets, crampons, mousquetons, pitons, etc.).
<LI>  Ne pas stationner sous les arbres et rochers surtout lorsqu'ils sont isol&eacute;s, ni 
sous les surplombs ou sous tout ce qui peut &ecirc;tre conducteur (eau qui ruisselle le 
long d 'une paroi).
<LI>  S'asseoir par terre, car la foudre est attir&eacute;e par tout ce qui d&eacute;passe (un arbre, un pic, ou un homme debout). Ne pas s'allonger ni s'appuyer contre une paroi.
<LI>  S'isoler au maximum du rocher ou du sol au moyen de tout mat&eacute;riau isolant : rouleau de corde, sac de couchage ou sac &agrave; dos dont l'armature est pos&eacute;e sur le sol ; il est pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable que ces objets soient secs.

<TD>A 3 000 m, la pression atmosph&eacute;rique a baiss&eacute; d'un tiers, &agrave; 5 800 m, elle n'est plus que la moiti&eacute; de la pression au niveau de la mer.<BR>
Le nombre de mol&eacute;cules d'oxyg&egrave;ne a diminu&eacute; dans la m&ecirc;me proportion : on se trouve en &eacute;tat d'hypoxie.<BR><BR>
La manifestation la plus b&eacute;nigne du mal des montagnes pourra se limiter &agrave; des mots 
de t&ecirc;te, une diminution de l'app&eacute;tit, des vomissements ou des insomnies qui appara&icirc;tront 
apr&egrave;s 6 ou 8 heures au-del&agrave; de 3 000 m. Un cachet d'aspirine pourra les faire dispara&icirc;tre progressivement. <BR>
<BR>
La forme aigu&euml; du mal des montagnes est l'oed&egrave;me pulmonaire (ou l'oed&egrave;me c&eacute;r&eacute;bral) 
: la pression augmente dans les art&egrave;res pulmonaires, la membrane qui s&eacute;pare l'air 
et le sang est fragilis&eacute;e et laisse filtrer du plasma qui envahit l'alv&eacute;ole pulmonaire 
(ou les cellules c&eacute;r&eacute;brales). Il faut redescendre la victime le plus rapidement possible. 
Sinon, la mort peut survenir rapidement. Les s&eacute;quelles peuvent &ecirc;tre graves. Un oed&egrave;me 
des mains, des chevilles ou des jambes, moins grave, peut &eacute;galement se produire. 
Il dispara&icirc;tra en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral en deux ou trois jours si l'on ne reprend pas 1'aItitude. <BR>
<BR>
<H1><IMG HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">Quelques<BR>conseils<BR>pr&eacute;ventifs<BR CLEAR=LEFT></H1>
Ces maux, parfois extr&ecirc;mement graves, sont dus &agrave; une mauvaise acclimatation &agrave; la diminution 
de la pression atmosph&eacute;rique. La rapidit&eacute; &agrave; laquelle on s'habitue &agrave; l'altitude d&eacute;pend 
de nos chromosomes et non pas de notre technique alpine. La bonne acclimatation demande du temps. Une marche d 'approche longue le permet :<BR>
il faut compter 5 jours au minimum pour passer sans risque de 3 000 m &agrave; 5 000m. Aucun 
moyen ne permet de s'habituer plus vite &agrave; l'altitude : on peut simplement augmenter 
les facteurs qui favorisent une bonne acclimatation en s'hydratant correctement pour 
emp&ecirc;cher le sang de devenir plus &eacute;pais et favoriser l'arriv&eacute;e d 'oxyg&egrave;ne dans les cellules.</TD></TR></TABLE>

Le temps change vite en montagne et les variations de temp&eacute;rature peuvent &ecirc;tre brutales 
: le coup de froid, comme le coup de chaleur, peut intervenir brusquement et avoir des cons&eacute;quences f&acirc;cheuses si des pr&eacute;cautions n'ont pas &eacute;t&eacute; prises. C'est pourquoi, &eacute;t&eacute; comme hiver, I'&eacute;quipement personnel doit &ecirc;tre adapt&eacute; &agrave; ces &eacute;carts de temp&eacute;ratures.<P>
Ces variations de temp&eacute;rature sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement li&eacute;es &agrave; l'arriv&eacute;e d'une perturbation, &agrave; de fortes pr&eacute;cipitations, &agrave; un fort refroidissement nocturne, &agrave; l'influence du vent, comme par exemple le foehn (vent chaud et sec d&ucirc; &agrave; l'&eacute;chauffement de l'air d&eacute;charg&eacute; de son humidit&eacute; apr&egrave;s le passage d'un relief), ou encore &agrave; l'enneigement du sol ou au retour du beau temps. Une information primordiale est donn&eacute;e sous la forme de 
l'altitude de l'isotherme 0 degr&eacute; Celsius. <P>
<I>Isotherme 0 degr&eacute; Celsius = surface fictive regroupant l'ensemble des points de l'atmosph&egrave;re o&ugrave; la temp&eacute;rature est &eacute;gale &agrave; 0 degr&eacute; Celsius.</I><P>
Pour l'alpiniste ou le skieur, I'isotherme 0 degr&eacute; Celsius est un rep&egrave;re qui indique si l'air est plus ou moins froid ou plus ou moins chaud en altitude. Les fluctuations de l'isotherme 0 degr&eacute; Celsius accompagnent les changements de masses d'air (lors du passage d'une perturbation par exemple). La stabilit&eacute; de l'isotherme 0 degr&eacute; Celsius indique une situation sans &eacute;volution notable. <P>

En montagne, une baisse de temp&eacute;rature est le plus souvent un facteur de s&eacute;curit&eacute;. En &eacute;t&eacute;, par exemple, un fort regel s&eacute;curise la progression sur une surface enneig&eacute;e et limite les risques de chute de pierres. Il peut cependant y avoir danger si l'&eacute;quipement individuel est insuffisant. Pour l'homme, la sensation de froid est essentiellement fonction de la vitesse de refroidissement de la peau. Ce refroidissement d&eacute;pend de plusieurs facteurs m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques et de leur variation.<P>

<LI>La sensation de froid augmente avec le degr&eacute; d'humidit&eacute; de l'air.<BR>
<LI>Le vent, par l'&eacute;vaporation qu'il provoque au niveau de la peau, est un facteur essentiel de refroidissement.

L'hypothermie est un refroidissement g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'organisme avec abaissement progressif de la temp&eacute;rature corporelle centrale. Toutes les fonctions de l'organisme se ralentissent, ce qui entra&icirc;ne d'abord un affaiblissement de la volont&eacute;, une perte de vigilance et, en terme ultime, un arr&ecirc;t cardio-respiratoire.<P>
L'hypothermie ne survient g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement qu'&agrave; l'occasion d'expositions prolong&eacute;es au froid. En l'absence de protection suffisante, elle peut &ecirc;tre aggrav&eacute;e par un vent intense. L'hypothermie atteint surtout des alpinistes &eacute;gar&eacute;s ou immobilis&eacute;s en paroi lors d'intemp&eacute;ries, ou pris dans des avalanches.<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<LI>Porter des v&ecirc;tements appropri&eacute;s &agrave; l'activit&eacute; physique et sportive pratiqu&eacute;e et susceptibles de s'adapter aux variations Atmosph&eacute;riques.
<LI>Boire chaud et en abondance.
<LI>Avoir une alimentation adapt&eacute;e, hypercalorique (viande s&eacute;ch&eacute;e, lard, f&eacute;culents, p&acirc;tes, fruits secs, l&eacute;gumes secs, etc.).
<LI>Proscrire formellement les boissons alcoolis&eacute;es, car l'alcool, en dilatant les vaisseaux, favorise la d&eacute;perdition de chaleur &agrave; la surface de la peau.</UL><P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="images/gelures.gif">
Les gelures se d&eacute;veloppent insidieusement : c'est l&agrave; leur principal danger. Perte progressive de la sensibilit&eacute;, engourdissement et p&acirc;leur de la zone atteinte sont autant de signaux d'alarme qui surviennent bien souvent &agrave; l'insu de l'individu lui-m&ecirc;me.<BR>
Elles surviennent aux extr&eacute;mit&eacute;s ou plus g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement sur les zones d&eacute;couvertes.<BR>
Le port de v&ecirc;tements et de chaussures humides (surtout serr&eacute;es) les favorise, de m&ecirc;me que tout ce qui entrave la circulation du sang dans des conditions de froid extr&ecirc;me. Il en va de m&ecirc;me du contact direct de la peau avec des corps m&eacute;talliques froids.<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H1><IMG HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">Quelques<BR>conseils<BR>pr&eacute;ventifs<BR CLEAR=LEFT></H1>
Ils reposent, l&agrave; encore, sur l'utilisation de v&ecirc;tements assurant une protection efficace contre le froid et le vent, le recouvrement syst&eacute;matique de toutes les parties d&eacute;couvertes et l'absorption de boissons chaudes en grande quantit&eacute;.<BR>
En groupe, il convient de se surveiller mutuellement et r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement le nez, les oreilles et les joues.<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<CENTER><H2>Que faire en cas de gelure ?<P>
<IMG SRC="images/picto003.gif"></H2>
<I>Il ne faut en aucun cas r&eacute;chauffer une zone gel&eacute;e sauf si l'on est s&ucirc;r que ce r&eacute;chauffement pourra &ecirc;tre durable et permanent jusqu'&agrave; l'arriv&eacute;e des secours.<P>
La situation la plus dramatique serait celle d 'une &quot;re-gelure&quot; sur une l&eacute;sion pr&eacute;alablement r&eacute;chauff&eacute;e.<P>
Si l'on opte pour le r&eacute;chauffement, il faut que celui-ci s 'effectue correctement :<BR>
immersion de l'extr&eacute;mit&eacute; gel&eacute;e dans un bain &agrave; 37 degrs Celsius additionn&eacute; d'une solution antiseptique du type Dakin.<P>
Il faut y associer n&eacute;cessairement un r&eacute;chauffement g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'organisme, par exemple par l'utilisation de couvertures de survie ou de duvets cloisonn&eacute;s.<P>
<B>Ne jamais pratiquer de frictions directes, de flagellations ou de chauffage &agrave; la flamme.<BR>
Prendre contact le plus t&ocirc;t possible avec une &eacute;quipe m&eacute;dicale sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e dans le traitement des gelures.</B></I></CENTER><HR>

<LI>Bien qu'agr&eacute;able pour toute sortie en montagne, un beau temps durable ou une hausse des temp&eacute;ratures pr&eacute;sentent quelques dangers inattendus.
<LI>Les pierres ench&acirc;ss&eacute;es dans la glace sont lib&eacute;r&eacute;es et les chutes de pierres sont extr&ecirc;mement fr&eacute;quentes.
<LI>La neige fond plus rapidement, particuli&egrave;rement dans les n&eacute;v&eacute;s, les couloirs et sur les pentes expos&eacute;es au soleil, ce qui peut entra&icirc;ner des coul&eacute;es de neige ou des avalanches de fonte, ainsi que la fragilisation ou la disparition des ponts de neige sur les crevasses ou les torrents.
<LI>Sur les individus, la chaleur peut engendrer, par ordre de gravit&eacute; croissant, des 
crampes, une insolation ou un &quot;coup de chaleur&quot;.
</UL>
<IMG HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/crampes.gif">
Les crampes de chaleur apparaissent au cours d'un effort physique intense et prolong&eacute;. 
Elles sont dues &agrave; des pertes importantes de sodium et de chlore contenus dans la 
sueur. Non compens&eacute;es par l'absorption de boissons l&eacute;g&egrave;rement sal&eacute;es, elles peuvent conduire &agrave; un &eacute;tat d'&eacute;puisement.<BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
<IMG HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/insolation.gif">
L'insolation r&eacute;sulte de l'exposition &agrave; une temp&eacute;rature &eacute;lev&eacute;e avec un fort ensoleillement 
et survient indiff&eacute;remment au repos ou dans I'effort.<BR>
Maux de t&ecirc;te, vertiges, fatigue extr&ecirc;me, perte de l'app&eacute;tit et sueurs froides en sont les principaux sympt&ocirc;mes. La temp&eacute;rature de l'individu est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement normale ou peu &eacute;lev&eacute;e.<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/hyperthermie.gif">
Le &quot;coup de chaleur&quot;, terminologie faussement rassurante, est un accident majeur d&ucirc; &agrave; la chaleur et constitue une TRES GRANDE URGENCE MEDICALE.<BR>
Plus que l'exposition directe au soleil, ce sont les conditions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques et la nature du terrain qui jouent ici un r&ocirc;le d&eacute;terminant. Le coup de chaleur survient &agrave; la suite d'un exercice musculaire intense et prolong&eacute; de type &quot;endurance&quot;. La production de chaleur qui en r&eacute;sulte, associ&eacute;e &agrave; la forte charge thermique ambiante li&eacute;e &agrave; la temp&eacute;rature de l'air et &agrave; l'ensoleillement, d&eacute;passe les possibilit&eacute;s de dissipation de la chaleur par le corps humain. A cela s'ajoute le fait que la sudation est g&ecirc;n&eacute;e, voire supprim&eacute;e par l'&eacute;ventuelle humidit&eacute; ambiante, I absence de vent et le port de v&ecirc;tements emp&ecirc;chant I'&eacute;limination de la transpiration. Certains facteurs li&eacute;s au sujet lui m&ecirc;me, les ant&eacute;c&eacute;dents m&eacute;dicaux, I'&acirc;ge, le manque d'entra&icirc;nement ou d'acclimatation sont &eacute;galement &agrave; incriminer.
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=5 SRC="images/picto004.gif"></CENTER>
Le cas typique est celui d'une progression dans une combe ou un vallon encaiss&eacute;s, peu ou pas ventil&eacute;s, &eacute;ventuellement enneig&eacute;s, provoquant une r&eacute;flexion maximale du 
soleil dans une ambiance proche de la saturation en vapeur d'eau (80 &agrave; 90 pour cent 
d'humidit&eacute;). Tout commence, g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement, comme une insolation banale mais tr&egrave;s vite la situation va s'aggraver. La d&eacute;marche est titubante ; aux troubles du comportement va succ&eacute;der un &eacute;tat comateux. La temp&eacute;rature du sujet s'&eacute;l&egrave;ve, pouvant atteindre, voire d&eacute;passer, 40 degr&eacute;s Celsius.<BR>
Fait marquant, la victime ne pr&eacute;sente, la plupart du temps, aucune sueur.<BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>

<LI>Portez un bon chapeau.
<LI>Une bonne hydratation pr&eacute;alable est indispensable de meme qu'une protection vestimentaire 
l&eacute;g&egrave;re et adapt&eacute;e (tenue ample, de couleur claire, et si possible en coton).
<LI>Buvez souvent, profitez de chaque halte pour absorber 250 ml de boisson m&ecirc;me si vous 
n'avez pas soif : la transpiration est le meilleur moyen d'&eacute;liminer l'exc&egrave;s de chaleur

<LI>Enfin, la pratique r&eacute;guli&egrave;re de sports d'endurance, tels que la course de fond, est 
un bon moyen d'adaptation &agrave; la chaleur.

<H1><FONT SIZE=+4>L<FONT SIZE=+3>e rayonnement solaire<FONT SIZE=3></H1>
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><BR><HR SIZE=5><BR>
De tous les types de rayonnement engendr&eacute;s par le soleil, seul l'ultraviolet pr&eacute;sente 
un r&eacute;el danger pour le corps humain. A long terme, les surexpositions solaires sont 
notamment responsables de l'apparition de cancers de la peau, et de cataractes. A 
court terme, les ultraviolets, invisibles et non calorifiques, peuvent provoquer de graves 
dommages aux yeux et &agrave; la peau.<BR>
<H2&>A savoir</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Plus on monte en altitude plus le filtrage de ce rayonnement diminue ; ainsi le rayonnement est multipli&eacute; par 1,5 &agrave; 2000 m par rapport au niveau de la mer par 2,5 &agrave; 4000 m.
<LI>La r&eacute;flexion est maximale sur la neige.
<LI>Un ciel nuageux ou le brouillard n'absorbe pas ou peu les rayons ultraviolets et donne 
une fausse impression de s&eacute;curit&eacute;.
<LI>Plus on se rapproche de l'&eacute;quateur et du solstice d'&eacute;t&eacute; plus I ultraviolet est important.<P>
<IMG HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/ophtalmie.gif">
L'ophtalmie est une br&ucirc;lure par les ultraviolets de la corn&eacute;e qui est la couche protectrice de l'oeil. Cette br&ucirc;lure se d&eacute;veloppe &agrave; l'insu du patient et les premiers signes apparaissent sans liaison apparente avec l'exposition au soleil. Cela d&eacute;bute par une simple sensation de &quot;grain de sable&quot; sous les paupi&egrave;res, une rougeur des yeux et un larmoiement, puis apparaissent des troubles de la vision, pouvant se transformer en une c&eacute;cit&eacute; transitoire.<BR>
Il n'existe pas de traitement curatif. L'ophtalmie n'est pas grave en elle-m&ecirc;me. Elle 
gu&eacute;rit sans s&eacute;quelle en 48 heures avec quelques petits soins (application d'eau froide, pansements oculaires, mise au repos dans I obscurit&eacute;...). Elle est grave indirectement puisqu'elle entra&icirc;ne une perte totale d'autonomie de la personne qui en souffre (immobilisation d'une cord&eacute;e par exemple).<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H1><IMG HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">Quelques<BR>conseils<BR>pr&eacute;ventifs<BR CLEAR=LEFT></H1>
Le port de lunettes sp&eacute;ciales, couvrant tout I 'oeil avec des verres de haute qualit&eacute;, est indispensable. Les collyres pr&eacute;ventifs, liquides qui s'appliquent sur la conjonctive de l'oeil, propos&eacute;s dans le commerce (type Uveline) ne dispensent absolument pas du port de ces lunettes. Ces collyres doivent &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme une mesure de protection suppl&eacute;mentaire pour des yeux particuli&egrave;rement fragiles. Attention ! un flacon de collyre entam&eacute; doit &ecirc;tre d&eacute;truit apr&egrave;s deux ou trois semaines.<P>
<IMG HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/brulures.gif">
Le classique &quot;coup de soleil&quot; n'est autre qu'une authentique br&ucirc;lure cutan&eacute;e dont la gravit&eacute; exc&egrave;de toutefois rarement le deuxi&egrave;me degr&eacute;. Une br&ucirc;lure au premier degr&eacute; se caract&eacute;rise par une simple rougeur cuisante. Au deuxi&egrave;me degr&eacute;, il y a apparition de cloques ou d'ampoules (phlyct&egrave;nes).<P>
<CENTER><H2>T R A I T E M E N T</H2></CENTER>
Lorsque le coup de soleil est l&eacute;ger (pas de cloque), la douleur sera calm&eacute;e par l'utilisation de savons alcalins et mieux par l'application de Biaffine. Lorsque le coup de soleil 
est plus grave (avec cloque), appliquez sur la zone br&ucirc;l&eacute;e une biogaze avec antibiotique si la peau est d&eacute;chir&eacute;e. Prenez conseil aupr&egrave;s de votre pharmacien. Surtout, ne r&eacute;exposez jamais une zone br&ucirc;l&eacute;e m&ecirc;me l&eacute;g&egrave;rement. Prot&eacute;gez les avec des masques ou une cr&egrave;me I.P. 40 au moins r&eacute;appliqu&eacute;e toutes les 30 minutes.<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H1><IMG HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">Quelques<BR>conseils<BR>pr&eacute;ventifs<BR CLEAR=LEFT></H1>
Attention ! En montagne, la temp&eacute;rature souvent basse nous fait sous-estimer l'intensit&eacute; du rayonnement U.V. Les parties les plus sensibles sont les zones expos&eacute;es et saillantes : nez, oreilles, l&egrave;vres, front, cou, avant-bras...<BR>
Les v&ecirc;tements et masques repr&eacutesentent la meilleure protection possible. Les produits solaires (cr&egrave;mes et stick pour les l&egrave;vres) doivent &ecirc;tre appliqu&eacute;s au moins quatre &agrave; cinq fois par jour. Leur indice de protection (I.P.) doit &ecirc;tre &eacute;lev&eacute; : au moins 25.

Les grandes &eacute;tendues de neige vierge, tant recherch&eacute;es aujourd'hui par les skieurs, dissimulent bien des dangers.<BR>
Quelle que soit l'&eacute;poque de l'ann&eacute;e, des avalanches de neige poudreuse, de neige en plaque ou de neige humide peuvent en effet se produire sur les pentes enneig&eacute;es. 
<BR>
Les risques de d&eacute;clenchement d'avalanche spontan&eacute;e ou provoqu&eacute;e par le passage d'un ou plusieurs skieurs d&eacute;pendent de l'&eacute;tat du manteau neigeux qui &eacute;volue en permanence sous l'effet des conditions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques.<P>
<IMG HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/conduite.gif">
<B>L'ensevelissement sous une avalanche entra&icirc;ne de nombreux types de l&eacute;sions responsables de polytraumatismes, de compressions prolong&eacute;es, d'&eacute;tats d'asphyxie et d'hypothermies.</B><P>
Compte tenu de la gravit&eacute; des l&eacute;sions, les secours doivent b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier d'une m&eacute;dicalisation pr&eacute;coce sur les lieux m&ecirc;mes de l'accident (h&eacute;licopt&egrave;re, m&eacute;decin r&eacute;animateur). Durant l'attente les groupes autonomes doivent mettre en pratique leurs connaissances des &quot;gestes simples qui sauvent&quot;.<P>
Ainsi, s'il est indispensable pour sa propre s&eacute;curit&eacute; que tout randonneur soit &eacute;quip&eacute; d'une pelle et d'un Arva (appareils de recherche des victimes d'avalanche, petits 
&eacute;metteurs r&eacute;cepteurs dont chaque membre d'une &eacute;quipe doit &ecirc;tre muni), il est tout aussi important qu'il sache utiliser cet appareil pour secourir dans les meilleurs d&eacute;lais le compagnon de course enseveli.<BR>
Rappelons pour m&eacute;moire que la probabilit&eacute; de survie est de 93% pour une personne ensevelie sous une avalanche durant 15 minutes : presque toutes les personnes d&eacute;gag&eacute;es dans les 15 minutes suivant l'ensevelissement, qui n'ont pas subi de graves blessures et auxquelles les premiers soins ont &eacute;t&eacute; apport&eacute;s, sont sorties indemnes de la catastrophe. Mais entre 15 et 45 minutes d'ensevelissement, cette probabilit&eacute; de survie d&eacute;cro&icirc;t tr&egrave;s rapidement &agrave; 25 %, puis &agrave; 10 % apr&egrave;s deux heures car ceux des ensevelis qui ne disposent pas d'une poche d'air meurent par asphyxie (il y a &eacute;galement hypothermie).<BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>

<H3>Contenu des bulletins</H3>
Des bulletins quotidiens tr&egrave;s complets, <B>les bulletins neige et avalanche (BNA)</B>, sont 
diffus&eacute;s du 15 d&eacute;cembre au 30 avril.<BR>
Ils comprennent 6 rubriques :<BR>
<UL>
<LI><I>I'estimation des risques d'avalanche</I> : par massif et pour les 24 heures &agrave; venir avec la r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle europ&eacute;enne (indice chiffr&eacute; et signification) ;
<LI><I>les conditions d'enneigement</I> : limites inf&eacute;rieures d'enneigement skiable, enneigement moyen, valeurs ponctuelles... ;
<LI><I>I'&eacute;tat du manteau neigeux</I> : bilan des chutes de neige, descriptif des couches superficielles et internes en terme de qualit&eacute; et de stabilit&eacute; ;
<LI><I>un aper&ccedil;u m&eacute;t&eacute;o</I> : br&egrave;ve information sur les param&egrave;tres pr&eacute;vus ayant une influence sur l'&eacute;tat du manteau neigeux ;
<LI><I>I'&eacute;volution du manteau neigeux</I> : transformation attendue de la neige avec les cons&eacute;quences sur la stabilit&eacute;, la nature et l'intensit&eacute; du risque d'avalanche qui en d&eacute;coule ;
<LI><I>la tendance ult&eacute;rieure des risques</I> : sens probable de l'&eacute;volution du risque &agrave; &eacute;ch&eacute;ance d'au moins 48 heures.</UL>
Au cours de cette m&ecirc;me p&eacute;riode, de la mi-d&eacute;cembre &agrave; la fin avril, <B>des bulletins de synth&egrave;se hebdomadaire (BSH)</B> sont disponibles du jeudi au dimanche. Ils r&eacute;sument les 
ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes marquants de la semaine &eacute;coul&eacute;e, avec notamment le cumul des chutes de 
neige mesur&eacute;es depuis le jeudi pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent.<BR>
En automne et au printemps, plus exceptionnellement en &eacute;t&eacute; si des chutes de neige 
remarquables venaient &agrave; se produire, des informations plus succinctes sur les conditions 
de neige sont d&eacute;livr&eacute;es au moins une fois par semaine, &agrave; la veille des week-end.
<H2>Comprendre et interpr&eacute;ter les bulletins</H2>
L'information neige et avalanche est fournie &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle de massifs (superficie de l'ordre de quelques centaines de kilom&egrave;tres carr&eacute;s). Elle n'est valable qu'en dehors des pistes balis&eacute;es et ouvertes. C'est une information de synth&egrave;se qui s'attache &agrave; donner les particularit&eacute;s les plus repr&eacute;sentatives des conditions de neige existantes ou pr&eacute;vues. Des pr&eacute;cisions sont souvent apport&eacute;es en fonction de l'exposition, de l'altitude ou encore de la plage horaire.<P>
La consultation des bulletins neige et avalanche doit devenir un r&eacute;flexe quand on 
pratique la montagne enneig&eacute;e en dehors des pistes balis&eacute;es et ouvertes. En station, une information locale aupr&egrave;s des professionnels est &eacute;galement recommand&eacute;e.<P>
L'estimation des risques fait r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle europ&eacute;enne de risque d'avalanche qui comporte 5 indices. Chacun de ces indices correspond &agrave; un niveau de danger pour le pratiquant de la montagne. Aucun d'entre eux n'est &agrave; n&eacute;gliger : en montagne, le risque O n'existe pas. Ces indices sont ordonn&eacute;s selon la gravit&eacute; du danger auquel s'expose l'usager. L'augmentation du risque est bas&eacute;e sur l'aggravation et sur l'extension g&eacute;ographique de l'instabilit&eacute; du manteau neigeux.<P>
Le but des bulletins n'est ni d'interdire, ni d'autoriser la pratique de la montagne. 
Ce n'est qu'un outil d'aide &agrave; la d&eacute;cision permettant &agrave; chacun d'adapter son comportement aux conditions de neige. Il faut absolument prendre connaissance de l'int&eacute;gralit&eacute; du bulletin et ne pas s'en tenir au seul indice chiffr&eacute; sur l'&eacute;chelle, ni se fixer un seuil de risque arbitraire (par exemple : &quot;en risque 2, je vais partout&quot;). Seul le texte procure une information qualitative sur le type de risque et sa localisation &eacute;ventuelle.<P>
L'enseignement retir&eacute; du bulletin d&eacute;pend bien s&ucirc;r de l'exp&eacute;rience et de la connaissance du milieu montagnard que poss&egrave;de chaque utilisateur. Dans certaines situations le skieur peu exp&eacute;riment&eacute; peut &ecirc;tre amen&eacute; &agrave; annuler la descente de hors-piste ou la randonn&eacute;e projet&eacute;e et &agrave; rester sur les pistes ouvertes. Le skieur exp&eacute;riment&eacute; peut d&eacute;cider de maintenir une sortie pr&eacute;vue mais en choisissant un site moins expos&eacute; que celui initialement pr&eacute;vu.<P>
Une fois sur le terrain, il convient d'appr&eacute;cier si les conditions r&eacute;elles sont dans l'ensemble conformes &agrave; celles qui &eacute;taient annonc&eacute;es. En effet, la pr&eacute;vision du risque d'avalanche est &eacute;tablie &agrave; partir des conditions nivologiques existantes et des pr&eacute;visions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques, dont l'essentiel est indiqu&eacute; dans la rubrique &quot;aper&ccedil;u m&eacute;t&eacute;o&quot; du bulletin. Elle peut &ecirc;tre remise en cause si les conditions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques &eacute;voluent diff&eacute;remment de ce qui &eacute;tait pr&eacute;vu.<P>
Il est recommand&eacute; de prendre connaissance du Guide avalanche de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France que l'on peut se procurer dans les <A HREF="/meteo/france.html">Centres d&eacute;partementaux de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France</A> ou au <A HREF="/meteo/dir_10.html">Service documentation de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France</A>.<P>

<CENTER><B>En montagne, les activit&eacute;s sportives exigent toutes<BR>
le respect d'un certain nombre de r&egrave;gles communes, facteur<BR>
de r&eacute;ussite et gage d'une meilleure s&eacute;curit&eacute;.</B></CENTER><P>
<H2>La recherche personnelle de l'information</H2>
Toutes les sources possibles doivent &ecirc;tre consult&eacute;es sur :<BR>
<UL>
<LI>les conditions d'acc&egrave;s aux activit&eacute;s choisies ;
<LI>les possibilit&eacute;s d'approche de ces activit&eacute;s selon les aptitudes de chacun ;
<LI>la r&eacute;glementation r&eacute;gissant ces activit&eacute;s ;
<LI>les risques encourus ;
<LI>les conditions m&eacute;t&eacute;o &agrave; court et moyen terme.
</UL>
<H2>La condition physique</H2>
La condition physique doit &eacute;videmment &ecirc;tre bonne et la consultation pr&eacute;alable d'un m&eacute;decin est souhaitable dans la mesure o&ugrave; elle permet de d&eacute;celer les contre-indications selon la pratique sportive envisag&eacute;e. Une bonne pr&eacute;paration est conseill&eacute;e (footing, marche, musculation) et un entra&icirc;nement plus sp&eacute;cifique doit &ecirc;tre con&ccedil;u et pratiqu&eacute; 
en fonction de chaque activit&eacute; sportive envisag&eacute;e. Il faut d'abord se &quot;mettre en jambes&quot;, puis augmenter la dur&eacute;e de l'effort et les difficult&eacute;s.<P>
Se rappeler que la capacit&eacute; d'adaptation &agrave; l'altitude varie selon les individus, mais qu'une acclimatation progressive est indispensable &agrave; tous et surtout aux enfants.
<H2>Les techniques de base</H2>
Chaque discipline sportive demande l'acquisition d'un minimum de techniques (th&eacute;orique et pratique). Le meilleur moyen de les acqu&eacute;rir est de s'adresser aux &eacute;coles et centres sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;s ou/et de participer &agrave; des sorties en groupe sous la conduite d'instructeurs qualifi&eacute;s.<BR>
L'am&eacute;lioration de la technique personnelle garantit une meilleure efficacit&eacute;, une &eacute;conomie d'effort et une plus grande s&eacute;curit&eacute;.
<H2>L'&eacute;quipement</H2>
Il y a deux sortes d'&eacute;quipements : individuel et collectif.<BR>
Le mat&eacute;riel doit &ecirc;tre en excellent &eacute;tat, accompagn&eacute; si possible d'un n&eacute;cessaire de d&eacute;pannage imm&eacute;diat, d'une trousse personnelle de pharmacie et de moyens de signalisation (lampe, fus&eacute;e, sifflet, v&ecirc;tements fluorescents, etc.). Il doit &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre adapt&eacute; &agrave; la discipline pratiqu&eacute;e et aux conditions les plus d&eacute;favorables de la montagne : orage, vent, pr&eacute;cipitations, humidit&eacute;, alternance d'ombre et de soleil, de froid et de chaleur avec des &eacute;carts qui ne sont pas comparables &agrave; ceux que l'on trouve en plaine...<P>
<B>Attention : le sur&eacute;quipement en mat&eacute;riel sophistiqu&eacute; peut donner une fausse impression de s&eacute;curit&eacute;.</B>
<H2>L'aIimentation</H2>
L'alimentation doit &ecirc;tre adapt&eacute;e &agrave; l'intensit&eacute; et &agrave; la dur&eacute;e de l'effort demand&eacute; &agrave; l'organisme.<BR>
En montagne, il faut boire avant d'avoir soif manger avant d'avoir faim, souvent et 
en petite quantit&eacute;
<H2>Savoir s'orienter</H2>
En montagne, quelle que soit l'activit&eacute; pratiqu&eacute;e, il est indispensable de savoir 
s'orienter et de conna&icirc;tre sans cesse sa position sur le terrain.<BR>
Pour cela, il est n&eacute;cessaire de disposer d'un minimum d'outils dont il faut bien poss&eacute;der les techniques d'utilisation : cartes (carte IGN 1/50 000 pour la randonn&eacute;e sur les sentiers balis&eacute;s et 1/25 000 hors sentier) boussole et altim&egrave;tre. La lecture des cartes topographiques est &agrave; la port&eacute;e de tous, moyennant un petit effort initial ; elle apportera ensuite beaucoup de satisfaction. L'orientation approximative est facile &agrave; l'aide du soleil, mais en cas de mauvais temps, la boussole et l'altim&egrave;tre sont indispensables.<P>
Avant le d&eacute;part, se pr&eacute;parer chez soi par l'&eacute;tude des cartes, des guides et de toute documentation ad&eacute;quate pour acqu&eacute;rir une bonne connaissance du terrain (longueur des &eacute;tapes, difficult&eacute;s, possibilit&eacute;s d'abri ou de ravitaillement...).<BR>
Au fur et &agrave; mesure du d&eacute;placement, identifier les sommets, les cols, les vall&eacute;es. En cas de changement de temps, la carte permettra de choisir le meilleur itin&eacute;raire de progression, d'&eacute;chappatoire... ou de repli.
<H2>L'&eacute;tat d'esprit</H2>
Il faut se conna&icirc;tre soi-m&ecirc;me, avoir conscience de ses possibilit&eacute;s et limites personnelles, aborder les difficult&eacute;s avec humilit&eacute; et savoir renoncer ; conna&icirc;tre le milieu et respecter la nature ; et enfin, informer les parents, les amis, les gardiens de refuges, les h&ocirc;teliers ou les services de secours de ses projets (jours, horaires pr&eacute;vus, itin&eacute;raires).<BR>

</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><HR SIZE=5><BR>
<B>Etre conscient de l'existence des risques est un pas franchi vers la s&eacute;curit&eacute;. Il faut r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir avant d'agir et mettre en application les principaux conseils de base qui sont donn&eacute;s pour quelques-unes de ces disciplines sportives.</B><HR>
<H2>Le ski de piste</H2>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/danger.gif">RISQUES</H3>
La mauvaise condition physique est &agrave; l'origine de la plupart des accidents entra&icirc;nant des fractures aux jambes, aux genoux, aux hanches... Les risques d'accident proviennent &eacute;galement d'un &eacute;quipement inadapt&eacute;, de fixations mal r&eacute;gl&eacute;es (des fixations trop l&acirc;ches diminuent le contr&ocirc;le des skis), de collisions entre skieurs, de la mauvaise appr&eacute;ciation des difficult&eacute;s, de l'&eacute;tat d'une piste ou de son degr&eacute; de fr&eacute;quentation, ou encore d'un niveau technique du skieur insuffisant, qu'il pratique le ski alpin, le surf ou le monoski.<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">CONSEILS</H3>
Observer les consignes de s&eacute;curit&eacute; des stations, et en particulier respecter les horaires d'ouverture et de fermeture des pistes ; observer <A HREF="#commandements">les commandements des skieurs</A> ; 
ne jamais skier seul sur une piste inconnue.<BR CLEAR=LEFT><HR>
<H2>Le ski hors-piste</H2>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/danger.gif">RISQUES</H3>
Les risques proviennent des dangers principaux du hors piste (avalanches, crevasses, 
barres rocheuses), de la difficult&eacute; d'&eacute;vacuer un bless&eacute; &eacute;ventuel, et des obstacles inconnus (terrains accident&eacute;s et non s&eacute;curis&eacute;s).<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">CONSEILS</H3>
La technique doit &ecirc;tre sup&eacute;rieure &agrave; celle suffisante pour le ski de piste.<BR>
Il faut avoir une bonne connaissance de la montagne et s'informer sur l'&eacute;tat de la 
neige. Skier &agrave; plusieurs mais espac&eacute;s. Porter chacun un Arva.<BR CLEAR=LEFT><HR>
<H2>Le ski de randonn&eacute;e nordique<BR>
Le ski-alpinisme et la raquette</H2>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/danger.gif">RISQUES</H3>
Ces activit&eacute;s rencontrent tous les risques li&eacute;s aux conditions atmosph&eacute;riques et au terrain en montagne.<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">CONSEILS</H3>
Ce sont des sports assez rudes, pour bons skieurs en parfaite condition physique, 
bien &eacute;quip&eacute;s et autonomes.<BR>
Il est particuli&egrave;rement important de bien conna&icirc;tre les pr&eacute;visions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques, l'&eacute;volution de l'&eacute;tat de la neige, d'o&ugrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'avoir de bonnes connaissances en nivologie.<BR>
Pour le ski-alpinisme et certaines formes de randonn&eacute;e nordique, il est indispensable 
de se munir d'Arva individuels en bon &eacute;tat de fonctionnement et qu'il faut savoir 
utiliser (d'o&ugrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de fr&eacute;quents entra&icirc;nements pour conna&icirc;tre parfaitement la technique de recherche), ainsi que de pelles &agrave; neige.<BR CLEAR=LEFT><HR SIZE=2>
<CENTER><H2>10 REGLES DE CONDUITE POUR TOUS LES USAGERS DES PISTES</H2>
<I>Comme toute activit&eacute; sportive la pratique des diff&eacute;rentes disciplines de glisse sur neige comporte des risques et peut entra&icirc;ner des responsabilit&eacute;s.</I></CENTER><P>
<H3>1 - Respect d'autrui</H3>
Les usagers des pistes doivent se comporter de telle mani&egrave;re qu'ils ne puissent mettre 
autrui en danger ou lui porter pr&eacute;judice, soit par leur comportement, soit par leur 
mat&eacute;riel.
<H3>2 - Ma&icirc;trise de la vitesse et du comportement</H3>
Tout usager des pistes doit adapter sa vitesse et son comportement &agrave; ses capacit&eacute;s personnelles, ainsi qu'aux conditions g&eacute;n&eacute;rales du terrain et du temps, &agrave; l'&eacute;tat de la neige et de la densit&eacute; du trafic.
<H3>3 - Choix de la direction par celui qui est en amont</H3>
Celui qui se trouve en amont a une position qui lui permet de choisir une trajectoire ; il doit donc faire ce choix de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; pr&eacute;server la s&eacute;curit&eacute; de toute personne qui est en aval.
<H3>4 - D&eacute;passement</H3>
Le d&eacute;passement peut s'effectuer par l'amont ou par l'aval, par la droite ou par la 
gauche ; mais il doit toujours se faire de mani&egrave;re assez large pour pr&eacute;venir les 
&eacute;volutions de celui que l'on d&eacute;passe.
<H3>5 - Au croisement de pistes lors d'un d&eacute;part</H3>
Apr&egrave;s un arr&ecirc;t ou un croisement de pistes, tout usager doit, par un examen de l'amont et de l'aval, s'assurer qu' il peut s'engager sans danger pour autrui et pour lui.
<H3>Stationnement</H3>
Tout usager doit &eacute;viter de stationner dans les passages &eacute;troits sans visibilit&eacute; ; en cas de chute, il doit lib&eacute;rer la piste le plus vite possible.
<H3>Mont&eacute;e et descente &agrave; pied</H3>
Celui qui est oblig&eacute; de remonter ou de descendre une piste &agrave; pied doit utiliser le bord de la piste en prenant garde que ni lui ni son mat&eacute;riel ne soient un danger 
pour autrui.
<H3>Respect de l'information, du balisage et de la signalisation</H3>
L'usager doit tenir compte des informations sur les conditions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques, sur l'&eacute;tat des pistes et de la neige. Il doit respecter le balisage et la signalisation.
<H3>Assistance</H3>
Toute personne, t&eacute;moin ou acteur d'un accident doit pr&ecirc;ter assistance, notamment en donnant l'alerte. En cas de besoin et &agrave; la demande des secouristes, elle doit se mettre &agrave; leur disposition.
<H3>Identification</H3>
Toute personne, t&eacute;moin ou acteur d'un accident, est tenue de faire conna&icirc;tre son identit&eacute; aupr&egrave;s du service de secours et/ou des tiers.<P>
<I>Nota - On entend par usagers des pistes tous les pratiquants des disciplines de glisse 
autoris&eacute;es (ski, surf, monoski...). Les r&egrave;gles 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 s'appliquent 
aussi aux pratiquants qui vont hors pistes.</I><P>
<A NAME="commandements"><CENTER><H2>LES COMMANDEMENTS DES SKIEURS</H2></CENTER></A>
Le drapeau &agrave; damiers noir et jaune signale le danger d'avalanche ; le drapeau noir 
signale le danger g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute; d'avalanche.<BR>
Les pistes des stations peuvent &ecirc;tre ferm&eacute;es lorsqu'il y a risque d'avalanche : le 
hors-piste devient alors extr&ecirc;mement dangereux. Inversement, ce n'est pas parce que 
les pistes sont ouvertes, donc en principe s&eacute;curis&eacute;es, que le hors-piste est praticable.<BR>
Enfin, consultez l'information permanente des stations sur les risques d'avalanche, les bulletins neige et avalanche ; et sachez bien &agrave; quoi correspond chacun des cinq niveaux de l'&eacute;chelle europ&eacute;enne de risque d'avalanche.<HR>
<H2>La randonn&eacute;e p&eacute;destre</H2>
<B>Elle pr&eacute;sente d'autant plus de risques qu'elle est d'un abord facile et qu'elle attire 
un tr&egrave;s grand nombre de pratiquants n'ayant aucune connaissance de la montagne.<BR>
</B>
<CENTER><H3>Moyenne montagne (cotation R I &agrave; R III)</H3></CENTER>
<H4><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/danger.gif">RISQUES</H4>
Les randonneurs peuvent s'&eacute;garer, surtout par temps de brouillard, de pluie ou de 
neige. Ils peuvent glisser sur les n&eacute;v&eacute;s, notamment en d&eacute;but de saison, sur les pentes herbeuses ou les barres rocheuses, ou encore se faire entorses ou fractures, m&ecirc;me sur un terrain peu accident&eacute;. Ces derni&egrave;res sont le plus souvent dues &agrave; un &eacute;quipement insuffisant. <BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H4><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">CONSEILS</H4>
Respecter un certains nombres de consignes &eacute;l&eacute;mentaires :
<UL>
<LI>avoir un &eacute;quipement adapt&eacute;, surtout pour les chaussures ;
<LI>pr&eacute;voir l'arriv&eacute;e soudaine du mauvais temps et avoir dans le sac des v&ecirc;tements chauds et des provisions ;
<LI>suivre les sentiers balis&eacute;s, &eacute;viter les raccourcis douteux qui d&eacute;gradent la montagne et respecter la nature.
</UL><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<CENTER><H3>Haute montagne (cotation R IV)</H3></CENTER>
<H4><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/danger.gif">RISQUES</H4>
Aux risques rencontr&eacute;s en moyenne montagne s'ajoutent ceux inh&eacute;rents &agrave; la nature du terrain (travers&eacute;es de glaciers, de n&eacute;v&eacute;s).<BR>
Les chutes de pierres sont fr&eacute;quentes.<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H4><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">CONSEILS</H4>
Une s&eacute;rieuse pr&eacute;paration de l'itin&eacute;raire et une bonne connaissance du massif sont indispensables. La randonn&eacute;e en haute montagne comporte souvent des passages n&eacute;cessitant un minimum de pratique de l'alpinisme.<BR>
Un piolet pour le passage des n&eacute;v&eacute;s, une corde d'assurage et des crampons font imp&eacute;rativement partie de l'&eacute;quipement.<BR CLEAR=LEFT><HR>
<H2>La sp&eacute;l&eacute;ologie</H2>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/danger.gif">RISQUES</H3>
Les risques d'accidents en sp&eacute;l&eacute;ologie sont dus :
<UL>
<LI>aux crues des rivi&egrave;res souterraines, qui peuvent &ecirc;tre brutales ;
<LI>&agrave; l'&eacute;puisement, qui peut entra&icirc;ner l'hypothermie ;
<LI>aux chutes de pierres dans les puits, aux &eacute;boulis et tr&eacute;mies instables ;
<LI>&agrave; un mat&eacute;riel et un &eacute;quipement inadapt&eacute;s.
</UL><BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">CONSEILS</H3>
Il faut bien conna&icirc;tre ses limites, celles du groupe, et ne pas s'engager dans des 
explorations au-del&agrave; des capacit&eacute;s physiques et techniques de chacun.<BR>
Se renseigner pr&eacute;alablement sur le r&eacute;gime hydraulique de la cavit&eacute; et sur les conditions m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques. En tenir compte avant et pendant la progression.<BR>
En vue d'une &eacute;ventuelle attente forc&eacute;e, pr&eacute;voir en quantit&eacute; suffisante carbure, nourriture et couvertures de survie.<BR>
L'acc&egrave;s aux entr&eacute;es des grottes et des gouffres est souvent difficile en montagne. La marche d'approche comporte les m&ecirc;mes risques que pour l'alpinisme et n&eacute;cessite un mat&eacute;riel, un &eacute;quipement et une technique similaires.<BR CLEAR=LEFT><HR>
<H2>Le canyoning</H2>
<B>Il emprunte &agrave; la sp&eacute;l&eacute;ologie et &agrave; l'alpinisme leurs techniques, mais &eacute;galement leurs risques. Les conseils sont donc les m&ecirc;mes.</B><HR>
<H2>L'alpinisme</H2>
<B>L'alpinisme se pratique dans un contexte tr&egrave;s difficile. Il demande de la technique 
et de l'exp&eacute;rience.<BR>
Il est fortement soumis aux variations m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques brutales et il n'y a pas toujours d'&eacute;chappatoire en cas de brusques intemp&eacute;ries. Une course moyenne peut se transformer en une &quot;hivernale&quot; avec un bivouac improvis&eacute;.</B>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/danger.gif">RISQUES</H3>
L alpinisme est un sport &agrave; risque. Il ne faut pas partir &agrave; l'aventure et les risques doivent &ecirc;tre bien &eacute;valu&eacute;s. Ce ne sont pas forc&eacute;ment les itin&eacute;raires de haute difficult&eacute; qui comportent le plus de risques. Ceux-ci sont parcourus par des alpinistes tr&egrave;s exp&eacute;riment&eacute;s qui appliquent des r&egrave;gles de s&eacute;curit&eacute; extr&ecirc;mement strictes.<BR>
Les itin&eacute;raires d&eacute;crits dans les guides par les lettres F (Faciles), PD (Peu Difficiles) et AD (Assez Difficiles) sont attractifs et donc tr&egrave;s fr&eacute;quent&eacute;s, mais ils requi&egrave;rent les m&ecirc;mes r&egrave;gles de s&eacute;curit&eacute; que celles appliqu&eacute;es dans les parcours de haute difficult&eacute;. Ces itin&eacute;raires comportent des passages peu difficiles techniquement mais expos&eacute;s, comme des lignes de cr&ecirc;te, des passages d'ar&ecirc;tes ou des terrains mixtes (neige et rochers, travers&eacute;es de glaciers crevass&eacute;s...).<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">CONSEILS</H3>
M&ecirc;me pour un alpiniste confirm&eacute;, il est pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable faire appel &agrave; un guide professionnel en cas de n&eacute;cessit&eacute;. Une voie PD ou AD peut &ecirc;tre difficile &agrave; identifier ; l'erreur d'itin&eacute;raire est la cause de nombreux accidents.<BR>
Les alpinistes doivent disposer d'un mat&eacute;riel adapt&eacute; (casque et baudrier obligatoire) et conna&icirc;tre parfaitement les itin&eacute;raires de descente, les techniques de progression tous terrains et celles permettant de d&eacute;gager des voies, surtout par mauvais temps. Pour les risques de foudre, <A HREF="gmont004.html">se reporter au chapitre correspondant</A>.<HR>
<H2>Le vol libre</H2>
<B>Il ne peut se pratiquer qu'apr&egrave;s une initiation dans des &eacute;coles sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es.<BR>
Implant&eacute; partout (plaine, bord de mer), sa pratique en moyenne et haute montagne concerne plus le parapente que le deltaplane, par suite des difficult&eacute;s d'acheminement propres &agrave; cette derni&egrave;re discipline. N&eacute;anmoins, les lib&eacute;ristes sont souvent amen&eacute;s &agrave; survoler ces domaines.</B><HR>
<H2>Le deltaplane</H2>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/danger.gif">RISQUES</H3>
Le deltaplane peut &ecirc;tre pris dans des turbulences &agrave; proximit&eacute; des reliefs, ou &ecirc;tre surpris par des orages, des plafonds bas qui limitent ou interdisent certains passages et diminuent la visibilit&eacute;. Il peut &eacute;galement subir des vents de vall&eacute;e ou des cisaillements avec vents m&eacute;t&eacute;o ou autres ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes.<BR>
Le survol &agrave; basse altitude des glaciers et les passages de cols pr&eacute;sentent &eacute;galement des difficult&eacute;s.<BR CLEAR=LEFT><HR>
<H2>Le parapente</H2>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/danger.gif">RISQUES</H3>
Les risques sont similaires &agrave; ceux encourus lors de la pratique du deltaplane, en 
ajoutant le fait que le parapente est moins fiable en cas de vent fort ; il peut se replier totalement dans la turbulence (en cas de relief proche par exemple).<BR>
La facilit&eacute; d'utilisation peut constituer un risque, notamment en incitant &agrave; des d&eacute;parts sur des zones escarp&eacute;es ou inadapt&eacute;es, donc dangereuses.<BR>
La d&eacute;gradation des performances du parapente en cas de vent fort, ou dans les turbulences, est source de danger : il peut, par exemple, devenir impossible d'atteindre le terrain d'atterrissage, ce qui entra&icirc;ne un atterrissage en catastrophe, n'importe o&ugrave;.<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">CONSEILS</H3>
A chaque fois, prendre absolument en compte les pr&eacute;visions m&eacute;t&eacute;o, m&ecirc;me pour un petit vol. Il faut &eacute;galement :
<UL>
<LI>avoir un &eacute;quipement personnel adapt&eacute; et en bon &eacute;tat ;
<LI>une fois sur place, faire un diagnostic sans faille des conditions ; en cas de doute, 
m&ecirc;me l&eacute;ger, renoncer ;
<LI>sans connaissance de la montagne, se faire accompagner par un sp&eacute;cialiste de la montagne et du parapente, qui conna&icirc;t le milieu et sait y &eacute;voluer ;
<LI>ne pas tenter de d&eacute;collage inhabituel, &agrave; partir de falaises, de vires, de pentes abruptes, de petites surfaces de d&eacute;part, etc. ;
<LI>voler loin des reliefs et atterrir au plus vite en cas de variations des conditions 
atmosph&eacute;riques, m&ecirc;me mineures ;
<LI>signaler l'heure de d&eacute;part du vol, sa dur&eacute;e et l'endroit o&ugrave; il s'effectue.

<H2>Le v&eacute;lo tout terrain</H2>
<B>Aux risques et conseils d&eacute;j&agrave; d&eacute;crits dans cette brochure s'ajoutent tous les risques inh&eacute;rents aux difficult&eacute;s d'adaptation du VTT aux in&eacute;galit&eacute;s du terrain, ainsi que ceux dus &agrave; une perte de contr&ocirc;le du VTT dans les &eacute;clivit&eacute;s. Le port du casque est obligatoire.</B><HR>
<H2>La descente des torrents et des rivi&egrave;res</H2>
<B>La descente de torrents et rivi&egrave;res peut se faire en cano&euml;-kayak, en raft ou &agrave; la 
nage avec des flotteurs.</B>
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/danger.gif">RISQUES</H3>
Certaines rivi&egrave;res sont sujettes &agrave; des variations importantes et rapides du niveau 
d'eau en raison :
<UL>
<LI>de la fonte diurne des glaciers (mont&eacute;e d'eau dans l'apr&egrave;s-midi ou en fin de journ&eacute;e selon la distance) ;
<LI>des pluies en amont, parfois &agrave; plusieurs dizaines de kilom&egrave;tres ;
<LI>des l&acirc;chures des barrages hydro-&eacute;lectriques. Les parcours navigables sont class&eacute;s en 6 cat&eacute;gories en fonction des difficult&eacute;s : pentes, encombrements, visibilit&eacute;, obstacles naturels et artificiels, volume d'eau.</UL>
Les difficult&eacute;s d'&eacute;vacuation en cas de n&eacute;cessit&eacute; sont &agrave; craindre car il n'y a parfois qu'une seule sortie vers l'aval.<BR>
Dans certains mouvements d'eau (rapides, tourbillons et descente de l'eau vers des 
circuits souterrains par exemple), les risques de noyade sont importants.
<H3><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/icons/oeil.gif">CONSEILS</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Sachez nager &agrave; la surface et sous la surface de l'eau.
<LI>Informez-vous des difficult&eacute;s du parcours envisag&eacute; ; en plus des informations donn&eacute;es par les guides de rivi&egrave;res, n'h&eacute;sitez pas &agrave; demander des renseignements compl&eacute;mentaires aux &eacute;coles et clubs locaux.<BR>
<LI>Connaissez les dangers les plus importants :
<UL>
<LI>les d&eacute;versoirs et les barrages naturels ou artificiels qui peuvent, quelle que soit la hauteur de la chute, engendrer des mouvements d'eau ramenant et conservant les objets au pied de la chute ;
<LI>les dragues, les passerelles basses, les ponts submersibles, les prises d'eau, les piles de pont ;
<LI>les arbres tomb&eacute;s dans les rivi&egrave;res &eacute;troites et &agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur des virages serr&eacute;s ; 
<LI>dans les rivi&egrave;res en crues avec un courant rapide, les berges noy&eacute;es rendent les 
arr&ecirc;ts difficiles et l'eau est froide.</UL>
<LI>V&eacute;rifiez que votre forme physique et votre niveau technique correspondent au parcours 
choisi.
<LI>Ne naviguez pas seul, et avertissez de l'heure probable du retour.
<LI>V&eacute;rifiez votre &eacute;quipement :
<UL>
<LI>prot&eacute;gez-vous du soleil, du vent et de l'eau froide (avec une combinaison) ;
<LI>ayez toujours des chaussures aux pieds ;
<LI>portez le casque d&egrave;s qu'il y a du courant et des obstacles.</UL>
<LI>Choisissez un bateau adapt&eacute; &agrave; votre niveau, au parcours et correctement &eacute;quip&eacute; en flotteurs, poign&eacute;es, calages et si&egrave;ges confortables.
<LI>Emmenez une petite trousse de premiers soins, une corde de s&eacute;curit&eacute; et quelques aliments &agrave; assimilation rapide.</UL><HR>

<P>
L'id&eacute;e initiale d'un syst&egrave;me AVISO vent-flux (AVF) est le r&eacute;sultat d'une enqu&ecirc;te r&eacute;alis&eacute;e en 1987 aupr&egrave;s des principaux laboratoires scientifiques fran&ccedil;ais impliqu&eacute;s dans des programmes de recherche en m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie, oc&eacute;anographie et t&eacute;l&eacute;d&eacute;tection. Ceux-ci avaient alors exprim&eacute; un besoin important en param&egrave;tres et en produits pour l'&eacute;tude de l'interface oc&eacute;an/atmosph&egrave;re, issus &agrave; la fois des mod&egrave;les num&eacute;riques de pr&eacute;vision m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique, et des satellites m&eacute;t&eacute;o-oc&eacute;aniques.<P>

<H4>Depuis 1987, ce besoin s'est encore accru pour les raisons suivantes :</H4> 

<UL>
<LI>Les r&eacute;cents satellites m&eacute;t&eacute;o-oc&eacute;aniques (ERS, TOPEX/POSEIDON...), emportant pour la plupart des instruments nouveaux, n&eacute;cessitent un nombre important de donn&eacute;es de qualit&eacute;, ainsi que des outils performants &agrave; des fins de calibration et validation.<P>

<LI>Les progr&egrave;s constants des syst&egrave;mes de pr&eacute;vision num&eacute;rique m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique ont consid&eacute;rablement augment&eacute; la qualit&eacute;, et donc l'utilit&eacute; des produits qui en sont issus.
</UL>

Pour r&eacute;pondre &agrave; ces besoins, M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France a pris en charge depuis 1993 le d&eacute;veloppement d'AVF, comprenant les fonctions suivantes :<P>

<H2>ARCHIVAGE</H2> 

AVF archive les champs concernant l'interface oc&eacute;an/atmosph&egrave;re issus des mod&egrave;les num&eacute;riques de pr&eacute;vision m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique et de pr&eacute;vision d'&eacute;tats de mer de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France et du Centre Europ&eacute;en de Pr&eacute;vision M&eacute;t&eacute;orologique &agrave; Moyen Terme (CEPMMT). AVF archive &eacute;galement les donn&eacute;es temps r&eacute;el des satellites ERS, les donn&eacute;es vent et vague du satellite TOPEX/POSEIDON, ainsi que des produits temp&eacute;rature de surface de la mer et flux solaire incident &eacute;labor&eacute;s au Centre de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie Spatiale de Lannion &agrave; partir des satellites m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques NOAA et M&eacute;t&eacute;osat. Enfin AVF archive les observations m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques des navires et des bou&eacute;es transmises sur le r&eacute;seau m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique mondial.<P>

<H3>L'activit&eacute; du SETIM est orient&eacute;e vers la logistique du r&eacute;seau d'observation de METEO-FRANCE.<BR> <BR>Elle couvre tout le cycle de vie des instruments et des syst&egrave;mes d'observation, depuis leur conception jusqu'&agrave; leur  retrait du r&eacute;seau, en passant par le d&eacute;finition des sp&eacute;cifications techniques, la commande &agrave; un industriel , la recette technique, le stockage, la livraison, l'installlation et la maintenance.<BR> Ces activit&eacute;s ont souvent lieu en collaboration avec d'autres services territoriaux : c'est le cas de l'installation et de la maintenance, pour lesquelles le SETIM joue un r&ocirc;le de conseil et re&ccedil;oit le retour d'exp&eacute;rience qui permet de faire &eacute;voluer les mat&eacute;riels.<BR><BR>

Le SETIM a &eacute;t&eacute; dot&eacute; de moyens importants en laboratoires et plates-formes exp&eacute;rimentales pour &eacute;valuer des mat&eacute;riels, que ce soit pour des besoins internes &agrave; METEO-FRANCE, &agrave; la demande d'industriels (homologation) ou pour des comparaisons internationales dans le cadre de l'Organisation  M&eacute;t&eacute;orologique Mondiale (OMM).<BR> Ces installations ont permis &agrave; METEO-FRANCE d'&ecirc;tre d&eacute;sign&eacute; pour jouer le r&ocirc;le de Centre R&eacute;gional d'Instruments pour l'Europe (CRI).

L'observatoire a t fond  Trappes en 1896, par Lon Teisserenc de Bort, sur sa fortune personelle, pour assurer la participation Franaise  la campagne internationale d'tude des mouvements et d'altitude des nuages.
Au cours des annes 1896-1897 , une installation avec deux thodolites photographiques distants de 1318 mtres a permis de mesurer la hauteur et la vitesse de dplacement des nuages.
<A HREF="images/meteorographe1nb.gif"><IMG Width=150 height=100 SRC="images/meteorographe1nb.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="mtorographe"></A>
En 1897, Teisserenc de Bort s'est lan dans l'exploration de l'atmosphre  l'aide de sondes de mesure(mtorographes) de la temprature, de l'humidit et de la pression embarques sur des cerfs-volants, puis des ballon-sondes  partir de 1898.
<H3>Cette deuxime technique lui a permis de dcouvrir en 1902 une couche  isotherme au-del de 10000 mtres qu'il nommera plus tard la stratosphre.</H3>
A sa mort, en 1913, son hritire lgue l'observatoire  l'Etat de faon  ce que les travaux de recherche de son oncle soient poursuivis.<BR><BR><BR>

<H4>En 1927,Pierre Idrac et Robert Bureau exprimentent le premier metteur radio  dont les missions depuis la stratosphre sont reues au sol.
La modulation du signal radio par les mesures des paramtres atmosphriques de pression, temprature, humidit, permettent la ralisation des premires radiosondes.</H4><BR>
<H3>Le premier radiosondage au monde est effectu  Trappes en janvier 1929, par messieurs Bureau et Idrac.</H3>

<H4>Ce n'est que bien plus tard, en 1951, que le Centre Technique et du Matriel(CTM) est cr pour assurer les installations et la maintenance du rseau instrumental de la Mtorologie.
Son dveloppement aboutit en 1986  la cration du Service des Equipements et Techniques Instrumentales de la Mtorologie(SETIM).</H4>

Ces nuages ont un aspect fibreux (fibratus) et/ou un &eacute;clat soyeux. Ils peuvent prendre la forme de 
virgules ou de crochets ("uncinus"). Compos&eacute;s de cristaux de glace tr&egrave;s &eacute;pars, ils ne 
diminuent qu'&agrave; peine la luminosit&eacute; du soleil. Par suite de leur altitude, ils sont les premiers

appara&icirc;t, vert &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur et rouge &agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur. On dit alors que l'astre a 
une ''couronne". Cette couronne est surtout visible de nuit (autour de la lune).

<H1><CENTER>Altocumulus lenticulaires ("lenticularis")</H1>
<IMG BORDER=2 WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=337 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=10 
SRC="images/altocumulus_3.jpg"></CENTER><BR>
Esp&egrave;ce particuli&egrave;re d'altocumulus (et parfois de cirrocumulus ou de stratocumulus) en forme de 
lentilles ou d'amandes, souvent tr&egrave;s allong&eacute;s, dont les contours sont bien 
d&eacute;limit&eacute;s; ils apparaissent parfois en piles d'assiettes, superpos&eacute;es les unes aux autres et 
peuvent pr&eacute;senter des irisations. Ces nuages ''d'ondes" ont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement une origine 
orographique et apparaissent dans la partie ascendante d'ondes sinusoidales, form&eacute;es sous le vent des 
massifs montagneux, parfois tr&egrave;s loin de ceux-ci .

<H1><CENTER>Altocumulus castellanus (ou Ac. orageux)</CENTER></H1>
Autre esp&egrave;ce particuli&egrave;re d'Altocumulus (et aussi de Cirrus, Cirrocumulus, et Stratocumulus) 
pr&eacute;sentant dans leur partie sup&eacute;rieure des protub&eacute;rances cumuliformes analogues 
&agrave; de petites tours, ce qui donne &agrave; ces nuages un aspect cr&eacute;nel&eacute;. Les Altocumulus 
castellanus indiquent l'existence d'une certaine instabilit&eacute; &agrave; caract&egrave;re orageux en 
altitude; ils peuvent ainsi pr&eacute;c&eacute;der ou annoncer le d&eacute;veloppement de Cumulonimbus et 
des orages qui les accompagnent.

Un voile l&eacute;ger d'Altostratus laisse encore voir le soleil. L'Altostratus se pr&eacute;sente sous forme de 
nappe ou couche nuageuse gris&acirc;tre ou bleu&acirc;tre, d'aspect stri&eacute;, fibreux ou uniforme, 
couvrant enti&egrave;rement ou partiellement le ciel et pr&eacute;sentant des parties suffisamment minces 
pour laisser voir le soleil, comme au travers d'un verre d&eacute;poli ("translucidus"). L'Altostratus ne 
pr&eacute;sente pas de ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes de halo. Certains altostratus &eacute;pais peuvent masquer 
compl&egrave;tement le soleil (AItostratus ''opacus'') .

Couche nuageuse grise, souvent sombre, dont l'aspeet est rendu flou par des chutes plus ou moins continues de 
pluie ou de neige, atteignant le sol.<BR>
L'&eacute;paisseur de cette couche est partout suffisante pour masquer compl&egrave;tement le soleil. Il 
existe fr&eacute;quemment, au-dessous de la couche, des nuages bas d&eacute;chiquet&eacute;s, 
soud&eacute;s ou non avec elle.<BR>
L'Altostratus et le Nimbostratus forment le ''Corps" des syst&egrave;mes nuageux associ&eacute;s aux 
perturbations. (Des pluies continues de plusieurs mm par heure accompagnent le syst&egrave;me nuageux dans 
son d&eacute;placement). On les observe le long de la pente des fronts chauds, &agrave; la suite de la 
"t&ecirc;te'', form&eacute;e de Cirrus et de Cirrostratus, &eacute;voqu&eacute;e 
pr&eacute;c&eacute;demment. Le N imbo stratus marque g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement la trace au sol du front 
chaud; il peut par fois dissimuler la pr&eacute;sence de Cumulonimbus, surtout lorsque le front froid tend 
&agrave; rattrapper le front chaud (occlusion).

compos&eacute;es de dalles, galets, rouleaux, soud&eacute;s ou non.<BR>
La plupart des petits &eacute;l&eacute;ments dispos&eacute;s r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement ont une largeur

Les &eacute;l&eacute;ments de Sc peuvent s'&eacute;taler et se souder. Le Sc appara&icirc;t alors en couche 
continue pr&eacute;sentant des bourrelets.<BR>
Le Sc peut avoir un aspect mena&ccedil;ant, mais il n'est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement pas accompagn&eacute; 
de pr&eacute;cipitations. On peut le rencontrer en dehors des perturbations (zones de liaison) mais 
&eacute;galement dans le secteur chaud des syst&egrave;mes nuageux, entre le passage du front chaud et celui 
du front froid.

Couche nuageuse, g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement grise, &agrave; base assez uniforme, pouvant donner lieu 
&agrave; de la bruine, ou de la neige en grains. Lorsque le soleil est visible au travers de la couche, son contour 
est nettement discernable. Le stratus peut se pr&eacute;senter parfois sous forme de bancs 
d&eacute;chiquet&eacute;s. Sur cette diapositive, la base floue du Stratus, rep&eacute;r&eacute;e &agrave; 
l'aide de la Tour Eiffel, est &agrave; environ 200 m&egrave;tres au-dessus du sol.<BR>
On peut rencontrer le Stratus dans le secteur chaud des syst&egrave;mes nuageux, mais aussi par situation 
anticyclonique, en hiver, en dehors de toute perturbation. Le Stratus est alors un brouillard qui ne touche pas 
(ou qui ne touche plus) le sol.

<H1><CENTER>Brouillard.</H1>
<IMG BORDER=2 WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=339 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=10 
SRC="images/stratus_2.jpg"></CENTER><BR>
Le brouillard est un nuage au niveau du sol, qui r&eacute;duit la visibilit&eacute; dans toutes les directions 
&agrave; moins d'un kilom&egrave;tre. Il se forme soit par "rayonnement" (refroidissement nocturne du sol en 
l'absence de couverture nuageuse), soit par augmentation de l'humidit&eacute; de l'air (par ''m&eacute;lange" 
ou par "advection'' d'air humide chaud au-dessus d'une &eacute;tendue maritime ou d'un sol plus froid). Lorsque 
le sol se r&eacute;chauffe, il &eacute;volue souvent en Stratus.

<H1>Cumulus humilis</H1>
Esp&egrave;ce &agrave; faible d&eacute;veloppement vertical. Ces nuages de beau temps sont li&eacute;s 
&agrave; la variation diurne de temp&eacute;rature. ils apparaissent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement le matin et 
disparaissent le soir.


<H1>Cumulus m&eacute;diocris</H1>
L'extension verticale de cette esp&egrave;ce est plus importante que pour les Cumulus humilis.


<H1>Cumulus congestus</H1>
Cumulus &agrave; d&eacute;veloppement vertical important. L'aspect bouillonnant r&eacute;v&egrave;le de 
puissants mouvements verticaux. Les parties sup&eacute;rieures de ces nuages, &eacute;clair&eacute;es par le 
soleil, sont le plus souvent d'un blanc &eacute;clatant alors que leur base est relativement sombre. Au terme de 
leur &eacute;volution, ils peuvent donner naissance &agrave; une averse, mais de tels nuages se transforment 
fr&eacute;quemment en Cumulonimbus.

"Nuage dense et puissant, &agrave; extension verticale consid&eacute;rable, en forme de montagne ou 
d'&eacute;normes tours. Une partie au moins de sa r&eacute;gion sup&eacute;rieure est 
g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement lisse, fibreuse ou stri&eacute;e et presque toujours aplatie; cette partie 
cirriforme s'&eacute;tale souvent en forme d'enclume ou de vaste panache''.<BR>
Au-dessous de la base de ce nuage, tr&egrave;s sombre, il existe fr&eacute;quemment des nuages bas 
d&eacute;chiquet&eacute;s, soud&eacute;s ou non avec elle, et des pr&eacute;cipitations. Son aspect rappelle 
souvent celui d'un nimbostratus, pour un observateur plac&eacute; au-dessous.<BR>
Le Cumulonimbus Calvus ressemble &agrave; un Cumulus congestus dans le quel certains bourgeonnements 
commencent &agrave; former une masse blan ch&acirc;tre, avec des stries plus ou moins verticales, mais 
o&ugrave; aucune partie cirriforme ne peut &ecirc;tre encore distingu&eacute;e. Une averse est nettement 
visible, ici, sous la base du nuage.<BR>
Le Cumulonimbus Capillatus, stade ultime du Cumulonimbus en pleine maturit&eacute; pr&eacute;sente 
toujours &agrave; sa partie sup&eacute;rieure une enclume un panache ou une vaste chevelure cirriforme plus 
ou moins d&eacute;sordonn&eacute;e. G&eacute;n&eacute;rateur d'averses de grains (coups de vent), d'orages 
et de gr&ecirc;le (une averse orageuse dans nos r&eacute;gions peut donner jusqu'&agrave; 30 &agrave; 100 
mm de pluie en une heure, soit 30 &agrave; 100 litres au m2).<BR>
Les Cumulonimbus r&eacute;sultent de mouvements verticaux violents engendr&eacute;s par le 
r&eacute;chauffement de l'air au voisinage du sol, le jour, ou de la surface de la mer la nuit (convection 
thermique), le relief ou la rencontre de masses d'air d'origine et de structure thermique diff&eacute;rentes 
("fronts''), mouvements qui peuvent se propager et s'amplifier jusqu'&agrave; 10-12 km, voire 20 km d'altitude 
dans les r&eacute;gions tropicales (vitesses verticales de
l'ordre de 5 &agrave; 30 m/s).<BR>
On peut donc rencontrer les Cumulonimbus de mani&egrave;re isol&eacute;e, I'&eacute;t&eacute;, notamment 
en montagne, mais &eacute;galement en lignes de grains plus ou moins continues, le long des fronts froids, 
&agrave; nos latitudes ou le long de
"tornades" en Afrique.

<H2> Coupe verticale d'un front chaud </H2>
<CENTER><IMG BORDER=2 WIDTH=467 HEIGHT=379 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=10 
SRC="images/front_chaud.jpg"></CENTER><BR>
Un grand nombre des nuages qui se pr&eacute;sentent en voile ou en couche, quelque soit leur &eacute;tage, 
sont des nuages d'&eacute;talement, caract&eacute;ristiques du front chaud d'une perturbation. Ici, I'air chaud 
(en rouge) plus rapide, s'&eacute;l&egrave;ve au-dessus de l'air froid (bleu). Des nuages se forment le long de 
la surface de discontinuit&eacute; s&eacute;parant les deux masses d'air (par d&eacute;tente, refroidissement 
et condensation), et l'on trouve, dans l'ordre, au fur et &agrave; mesure que la trace, au sol, du front chaud se 
rapproche (de droite &agrave; gauche sur la diapositive): les Cirrus et Cirrostratus (nuages de "t&ecirc;te'') 
puis l'Altostratus et le Nimbostratus, accompagn&eacute; de pr&eacute;cipitations et de nuages bas (nuages de 
"corps").<BR>
Plusieurs centaines de kilom&egrave;tres s&eacute;parent l'arriv&eacute;e des premiers Cirrus du 
d&eacute;but des pr&eacute;cipitations (soit, en un point donn&eacute;, plusieurs heures pendant lesquelles la 
pression atmosph&eacute;rique en surface baisse r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement) .

<H2>Coupe verticale d'un front froid </H2>
<CENTER><IMG BORDER=2 WIDTH=544 HEIGHT=380 VSPACE=2 HSPACE=10 
SRC="images/front_froid.jpg"></CENTER><BR>
L'irruption de l'air froid, &agrave; l'arri&egrave;re d'une perturbation, se traduit par un soul&egrave;vement 
brutal de l'air chaud pr&eacute;existant. Les nuages qui se forment sur la surface de discontinuit&eacute; (front 
froid) sont donc en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des nuages &agrave; grand d&eacute;veloppement vertical: 
Cumulonimbus, suivis d'autres nuages identiques ou de Cumulus, dans l'air froid post&eacute;rieur, formant "la 
tra&icirc;ne" de la perturbation. Apr&egrave;s le passage du front froid, de dur&eacute;e relativement 
br&egrave;ve, on enregistre g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement une hausse progressive de la pression

Les milieux h&eacute;t&eacute;rog&egrave;nes et dispers&eacute;s, aussi bien les nuages de 
poussi&egrave;res que les nuages d'eau ou de glace donnent lieu &agrave; des accumulations s&eacute;lectives 
de charges &eacute;lectriques. Les mouvements violents et de grande amplitude des Cumulonimbus 
d&eacute;truisent les &eacute;quilibres &eacute;lectriques que ces charges auraient en leur absence, et
ceci cr&eacute;e des diff&eacute;rences de potentiel consid&eacute;rables (plusieurs millions de volts) entre 
divers points du nuage ou entre nuage et sol.<BR>
Un nuage n'est pas un conducteur &eacute;lectrique mais, sous l'effet des champs &eacute;lectriques 
consid&eacute;rables, I'air peut localement s'ioniser. Cette ionisation se propage de proche en proche sur un 
canal privil&eacute;gi&eacute; d&eacute;termin&eacute; par les configurations du champ &eacute;lectrique. 
Les charges &eacute;lectriques empruntent ce canal qui est ainsi devenu conducteur.<BR>
C'est l'&eacute;clair, d&eacute;charge rapide, saccad&eacute;e et r&eacute;p&eacute;titive qui permet un 
&eacute;coulement &eacute;lectrique d'une intensit&eacute; de centaines de kiloamp&egrave;res pendant des 
temps d'une fraction de seconde.<BR>
Le tonnerre est la perception de l'onde de choc caus&eacute;e par la progression rapide de la 
d&eacute;charge.<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

Il arrive, enfin, par certaines conditions thermiques extr&ecirc;mes (un front froid faisant irruption, par 
exemple, sur un sol surchauff&eacute;) que les Cumulonimbus puissent engendrer des 
ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes, heureusement exceptionnels dans nos r&eacute;gions, comme les trombes ou les 
tornades. Il s'agit de tourbillons &agrave; axe sensiblement vertical, qui se d&eacute;veloppent sous le 
Cumulonimbus en suivant son d&eacute;placement et dont la vitesse due &agrave; la rotation peut atteindre 
plus de 100 km/h.<BR>
lls constituent alors une v&eacute;ritable chemin&eacute;e aspirante &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur de laquelle la 
pression ne cesse de diminuer (on a not&eacute; au passage des trombes une baisse de pression 
instantan&eacute;e pouvant atteindre 40 mb). Les b&acirc;timents &eacute;clatent &agrave; son passage et la 
trombe est mat&eacute;rialis&eacute;e par l'ensemble des mat&eacute;riaux, de la terre et de la 
poussi&egrave;re qu'elle soul&egrave;ve mais aussi par le c&ocirc;ne nuageux renvers&eacute; qui semble 
descendre du nuage et provient, en fait, de la condensation de la vapeur d'eau d&egrave;s le niveau du sol.<BR>
A la surface de la mer, la "trombe marine'' peut se terminer par un ''buisson" provenant du soul&egrave;vement 
de la mer &agrave; son passage et du bouillonnement d'&eacute;cume qui en r&eacute;sulte.<BR>
La dur&eacute;e d'une trombe est relativement br&egrave;ve, mais ses ravages peuvent &ecirc;tre 
&eacute;videmment consid&eacute;rables, sur plusieurs centaines de m&egrave;tres, voire sur plusieurs 
kilom&egrave;tres de distance.

<TITLE> IPM - Integrated Parallel Macros </TITLE>
<H1> <IMG SRC="../Images/logoipm.gif"> IPM</H1>

<HR>
<H2>IPM in a few words:</H2>

IPM is not a new message passing library. Not even a library. It is 
just a package of m4 macros built on top of existing message passing
libraries such as PVM 3.2.x, 3.3.x or PARMACS 6.0. It allows the user
to choose between parallel libraries at compilation time although he
retains a single source code - it therefore reduces development costs
while permitting the use of libraries that may be better suited for a
particular hardware configuration.  New releases of these libraries are
hidden from the user because of the compact IPM interface.
IPM has been designed keeping in mind the specifications for MPI.
An MPI subset, built on top of IPM calls, is provided with the IPM package.

<title>Service Central d'Exploitation Meteorologique</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Pr&eacute;sentation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale du service</h2>
<p>
Le Service Central d'Exploitation de la M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie (SCEM) est
le v&eacute;ritable centre nerveux de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France. C'est l&agrave; que sont trait&eacute;es
en temps r&eacute;el les informations sur le temps qu'il fait en France et
dans le monde.
<p>
Il dispose d'un centre de t&eacute;l&eacute;communication perfectionn&eacute;,
qui est un noeud important du syst&egrave;me de t&eacute;l&eacute;communication de 
l'Organisation M&eacute;t&eacute;orologique Mondiale. Gr&agrave;ce a ce syst&egrave;me, une
mesure m&eacute;t&eacute;orologique faite &agrave; l'autre bout du globe arrive &agrave; Toulouse
en quelques minutes.
<p>
Ensuite , les donn&eacute;es sont introduites dans un supercalculateur
Cray C90 sur lequel fonctionnent en routines des logiciels complexes
de simulation de l'atmosph&egrave;re. Cela sert &agrave; &eacute;tablir des pr&eacute;visions
jusqu'&agrave; 5 jours &agrave; l'avance, qui sont envoy&eacute;es directement &agrave; certains
usagers, francais et &eacute;trangers. Les pr&eacute;visions faites au SCEM sont
&eacute;galement distribu&eacute;es aux services locaux de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France (Directions
interr&eacute;gionales et centres d&eacute;partementaux), o&ugrave; elles sont mises en forme 
et adapt&eacute;es aux microclimats de chaque r&eacute;gion. Le SCEM pr&eacute;pare des
pr&eacute;visions sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es pour de nombreux secteurs &eacute;conomiques: marine,
aviation, gestion de l'&eacute;nergie, lutte contre la pollution notamment.
<p>
Le centre de calcul du SCEM et ses Crays
(<a href="/scem/images/cray.gif">Cray-2 et C90</a>) sont
utilis&eacute;s &eacute;galement par ses voisins de la m&eacute;t&eacute;opole: enseignement avec
l' <a href="http://www.enm.meteo.fr">ENM</a>, recherche avec le 
<a href="http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr:8000">CNRM</a> et le <a href="http://www.cerfacs.fr">CERFACS</a>.
De mani&egrave;re g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, le
centre est &agrave; la disposition de tous les chercheurs m&eacute;t&eacute;orologistes
francais qui b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient ainsi d'un outil leur permetant d'&ecirc;tre 
comp&eacute;titifs dans la communaut&eacute; scientifique internationale. Le SCEM
est &eacute;galement dot&eacute; d'un syst&egrave;me d'archivage de donn&eacute;es ultra-moderne
de grande capacit&eacute;, qui est utilis&eacute; pour garder la m&eacute;moire du climat,
sur la france et sur le globe.

<H1><CENTER>Climatologie de la France en 1994</CENTER></H1>
<HR>
<i>Dans la r&eacute;gion Nord-Est, </i><font size="+2"> 1994 </font><i> a &eacute;t&eacute; l'ann&eacute;e la plus chaude du si&egrave;cle. Cette douceur, remarquable sur la Lorraine, l'Alsace et la Franche-Comt&eacute;, a concern&eacute; l'ensemble de la France et, plus g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement, l'Europe occidentale.</i>
<P>
Les temp&eacute;ratures minimales annuelles de la r&eacute;gion ont &eacute;t&eacute; sup&eacute;rieures de 2 &agrave; 3 degr&eacute;s aux valeurs normales et ont battu tous les records de douceur depuis 1949, d&eacute;but des fichiers informatis&eacute;s &agrave; M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France, et m&ecirc;me depuis la fin du si&egrave;cle dernier si l'on se r&eacute;f&egrave;re aux archives centenaires de Besan&ccedil;on. Le nombre de jours de gel a &eacute;t&eacute; particuli&egrave;rement faible : &agrave; Strasbourg, on a enregistr&eacute; 35 jours de gel au lieu des 76 que l'on compte habituellement sur l'ann&eacute;e. Les temp&eacute;ratures maximales annuelles, sup&eacute;rieures de 1 &agrave; 2 degr&eacute;s aux valeurs normales, figurent &eacute;galement parmi les plus chaudes de ces derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies.
<P>
Ces moyennes exceptionnelles ont &eacute;t&eacute; le fait de la succession d'un hiver doux, d'une canicule estivale et d'une fin d'ann&eacute;e particuli&egrave;rement chaude. En dehors d'un mois d'avril normal et d'un mois d'octobre plus froid que la normale, tous les mois de l'ann&eacute;e ont pr&eacute;sent&eacute; des temp&eacute;ratures plus &eacute;lev&eacute;es que les valeurs normales. Paradoxalement, ces temp&eacute;ratures &eacute;lev&eacute;es ont &eacute;t&eacute; accompagn&eacute;es d'un ensoleillement tr&egrave;s m&eacute;diocre et de pr&eacute;cipitations l&eacute;g&egrave;rement plus abondantes que la normale.
<P>
La douceur de cette ann&eacute;e est essentiellement due &agrave; une remont&eacute;e plus persistante et plus puissante que d'habitude des hautes pressions de l'anticyclone des A&ccedil;ores, qui ont prot&eacute;g&eacute; l'Europe occidentale des descentes d'air polaire et plac&eacute; la r&eacute;gions sous l'influence d'un flux d'air chaud en altitude.

Toulouse is the French Capital city of Meteorology : in 1991, all National Research and Operational Services, the "Haute-Garonne" Meteorological district Centre, as well as the International Conference centre of M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France, were finally brought together on the site where ENM has been since 1982, thus creating one of the most important meteorological complexes in the world (with about 1000 Meteorologists) : the Toulouse M&eacute;t&eacute;opole, in which various other bodies cooperating with M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France (such as the Cerfacs : European Centre for Research and Formation in Scientific Advanced Calculations, or the environmental Navy Unit) are also located.<P>

In such a scientific and technical environment, taking into account the collaboration of ENM with the Toulouse Paul Sabatier University (which also has activities in the atmospheric field) and with other GE located in Toulouse, the teaching of meteorology benefits from a true synergy in almost all its aspects.<P>

<H1><CENTER>AVISO : Archive, Preview, Interpretation of data of Oceanographic Satellites</CENTER></H1>
<HR SIZE=5>
<P>
<P>
The initial idea of AVISO vent-flux system (AVF) is the consequence of an inquiry in 1987 among principal french scientific laboratories involved in research program about meteorology, oceanography and remote detection. These expressed a significant requirement about parameters and products for the study of ocean-atmosphere interface, stem at once from digital models of weather forecast and oceanographic satellites.<P>

<H4>Since 1987, this requirement have grown again for the following reasons :</H4>

<UL>
<LI>The recent oceanographic satellites (ERS, TOPEX/POSEIDON...), taking for the most new instruments, require an important amount of data of quality, as well as high performance tools for purposes of calibrating and authentication.<P>

<LI>Constants progress of digital weather forecast systems have significantly increased the quality, and so the use of products which are stemed from.<P>

</UL>

To reply to these requirements, M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France has taken charge since 1983 of development of AVF, including following functions :<P>

<H2>ARCHIVE</H2> 

AVF archive fields about ocean-atmosphere interface stemed from digital models of weather forecast and sea condition forecast of M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France and ECMWF (European Center of Meteorological Weather Forecast). AVF archive also real-time data of satellites ERS, wind and wave data of satellite TOPEX/POSEIDON, as well as products like surface sea temperature and incident solar flux developped at Centre de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie Spatiale at Lannion from meteorological satellites NOAA and M&eacute;t&eacute;osat. Finally, AVF archive meteorological observations of ships and buoies conveyed on worldwide meteorological network.<P>

<H2>PROCESSING</H2>
 
To reply in a efficient and progressive way to expressed requirements, AVF propose also products stemed from some processing :<P>

<UL>
<LI>Systematic processing : these processing have like principal aim the follow-up of feed and quality of the archive, and include a data quality control, as well as <A HREF="prodbilan_eng.html">statistical and graphic products `QUICK-LOOK'</A>, et <A HREF="prodcoll_eng.html">colocation</A> of satellites and conventiona `QUIasurements.<P>

<LI>Processing by request : many data of archive processing could be made by request, about for example calculation of derived statistical or geophysical parameters, or re-analysis of fields arranging differents media sources.<P>
</UL>

<H2>PLACING DATA AT DISPOSAL</H2>

Placing data at disposal is proposing by differents means (network, DAT etc...), according to user's requirements and the mass of concerned data. Besides, AVF proposes direct access by server to <A HREF="catalogue_eng.html">catalogue of available data</A>.<P>

<TITLE>METEO-FRANCE : la m&eacute;t&eacute;opole de Toulouse</TITLE>

<H1><IMG SRC="images/tlse.gif">   TOULOUSE</H1>
<HR>
Sa situation g&eacute;ographique privil&eacute;gi&eacute;e (&agrave; 150 km de la mer M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e, &agrave; 200 km de l'oc&eacute;an Atlantique et &agrave; une centaine de kilom&egrave;tres de la montagne pyr&eacute;n&eacute;enne), la richesse de son pass&eacute;, <A HREF="climtoul.html">son climat</A> et son cadre de vie s&eacute;duisant se sont conjugu&eacute;s pour faire de Toulouse un p&ocirc;le d'activit&eacute;s attractif, en m&ecirc;me temps qu'une ville o&ugrave; il fait bon vivre.

<H2>Un p&ocirc;le d'attraction </H2>

Capitale de la r&eacute;gion Midi-Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es, quatri&egrave;me m&eacute;tropole de France par sa population (600 000 habitants), l'agglom&eacute;ration toulousaine est, avec ses trois universit&eacute;s, son Institut National Polytechnique, ses douze Grandes Ecoles, ses 17 Instituts Universitaires de Technologie et ses 100 000 &eacute;tudiants,la seconde ville &eacute;tudiante de France apr&egrave;s Paris;  elle est aussi un important centre de recherches et de r&eacute;alisations scientifiques, techniques et industrielles, dans des domaines aussi divers que l'a&eacute;ronautique et l'espace, l'&eacute;lectronique et le logiciel, la chimie, la m&eacute;decine et la pharmacie, les biotechnologies, l'agroalimentaire, la m&eacute;canique, ou... la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie !<P>

<H2>Une ville sympathique</H2>

La richesse de son patrimoine architectural (nombreux monuments et h&ocirc;tels anciens), le pittoresque de ses places et jardins, la profusion de ses lieux de loisir et de rencontre (cin&eacute;mas, th&eacute;&acirc;tres, caf&eacute;s-th&eacute;&acirc;tre, terrasses,...), sa vie culturelle et artistique rayonnante (mus&eacute;es, manifestations musicales r&eacute;put&eacute;es,...) sans oublier sa gastronomie renomm&eacute;e, font de la "ville rose" une cit&eacute; qui sait offrir au visiteur et &agrave; l'habitant des conditions de vie harmonieuses.<P>

Dans un tel cadre de vie, l'&eacute;tudiant de l'ENM trouvera sans peine la stimulation intellectuelle n&eacute;cessaire &agrave; ses &eacute;tudes, ainsi que la satisfaction de ses aspirations l&eacute;gitimes &agrave; la culture et aux loisirs.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.cict.fr/Toulouse">Toulouse</A> est la capitale fran&ccedil;aise de la M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie : achev&eacute; en 1991, le regroupement sur <A HREF="http://www.enm.meteo.fr/site.html">le site</A> de l'ENM des Services nationaux <A HREF="http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr:8000/">de recherche</A> et <A HREF="http://www.meteo.fr/scem/accueil.html">d'exploitation</A> m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques, du Centre D&eacute;partemental de la M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie de Haute-Garonne, et du Centre international de conf&eacute;rences de M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France, a abouti &agrave; la constitution de l'un des plus importants complexes m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques du monde (environ mille m&eacute;t&eacute;orologistes) : <A HREF="http://www.enm.meteo.fr/image/site/meteopole.jpeg">la M&eacute;t&eacute;opole toulousaine</A>(260K).<P>

Dans un tel environnement scientifique et technique, et si l'on tient compte en outre des collaborations de l'ENM avec <A HREF="http://www.ups-tlse.fr/ups-tlse.html">l'Universit&eacute; Paul Sabatier</A> (qui a des activit&eacute;s dans le domaine de l'atmosph&egrave;re) et avec les grandes &eacute;coles toulousaines (collaborations bilat&eacute;rales ou au travers de groupements comme le P&ocirc;le Universitaire Europ&eacute;en, la Conf&eacute;rence R&eacute;gionale des Directeurs de Grandes Ecoles,...), l'enseignement de la m&eacute;t&eacute;orologie b&eacute;n&eacute;ficie d'une v&eacute;ritable synergie avec la quasi-totalit&eacute; des aspects de la discipline.<P>

Cette partie de la conference devrait se derouler du mardi 12 novembre a 9h00
au mercredi 13 novembre a 12h30.
<HR>
</UL>
<B> PRESENTATION DES LOGICIELS DE GESTION HIERARCHIQUE DES DONNEES</B></UL>
Plusieurs sites actuellement utilisateurs d'Unitree preparent des
evolutions importantes au niveau de leur centre de calcul (extension
ou remplacement du serveur de calcul principal, mise en place
de machines massivement parralleles, de clusters, ...). Ces  
changements vont avoir des impacts tres importants sur les besoins
en terme de gestion de donnees.</UL>
Afin d'eclairer ces sites dans leurs choix futurs, les produits de
gestion hierarchique de donnees (HSM) les plus importants seront
passes en revue. Seules les technologies aujourd'hui disponibles
(ou celles qui vont bientot l'etre) feront l'objet d'une presentation,
 les produits encore largement utilises mais qui ne sont plus
commercialises ne seront bien entendu pas abordes. Seuls les HSM
sous systeme d'exploitation de type Unix seront couverts.</UL> 
Il est prevu d'avoir, pour chaque produit, une presentation de la
part du vendeur, et si possible d'un site utilisant deja celui-ci.</UL>
A ce jour, la liste des logiciels devant etre presentes est la suivante :</UL>
<PRE>
<LI> ADSM, Turbo/ADSM           IBM Storage Systems</LI>
<LI> AMASS/DataMgr              EMASS </LI>
<LI> DMF                        Cray Research/SGI</LI>
<LI> HPSS                       IBM Government Systems</LI>
<LI> SAM-FS                     Large Storage Components</LI>
<LI> UniTree                    Unitree Inc., HP/Convex, Ahmdahl</LI>
</PRE>
</UL>
Cette liste n'est pas definitive et pourrait s'enrichir d'autres 
produits. Attention, il n'y a pas d'engagement formel a ce jour par
les fournisseurs ou par les utilisateurs a faire une presentation 
des produits ci-dessus mentionnes. 
</UL>
<B> PRESENTATION DE SUPPORTS DE STOCKAGE A HAUTE PERFORMANCES</B></UL>
Une presentation des medias de grande capacite et a acces a hauts-debits
completera ce symposium. Les principaux supports presentes seront :</UL>
<PRE>
<LI> D2		           Ampex</LI>
<LI> D3/Redwood	           STORAGETEK </LI>

<TITLE>METEO-FRANCE : Digital forecast</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<H1><CENTER>Digital forecast with ARPEGE model</CENTER></H1>

<HR>

<H2>ARPEGE model</H2>

<I>Digital weather forecast relies, in a large proportion, upon the use of atmosphere digital simulation softwares, usually called "models". M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France has put into operational service, the december 6th 1993, the most advanced version of the new </I><B>ARPEGE</B><I> model.</I>
<P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="images/arpege.gif">
The ARPEGE main innovation is its variable horizontal resolution : atmosphere is separated into small elemantary "boxes" whose horizontal size is minimal on France, to grow progressively up to antipodes where it is maximal. So we can, with an unique model, make fine-scale forecost on metropolotain territory, while describing with a sufficient description great phenomenons on global scale. 
<P>
ARPEGE model supplies twice a day forecasts with a resolution of <B>20 km for France and 300 km for antipodes</B>.

<BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
This new digital tool is developped in close collaboration with ECMWF (European Center of Meteorological Weather Forecast). It is conceived in the beginning as multi-purpose, allowing to make forecasts short-dated (up to three days), or to contribute to study of climate fluctuations and evolution.

        0. General Purpose:
        -------------------

        Fortran2html converts your source projects written in FORTRAN
        to the HTML syntax, enabling a fast navigation mode and variables
        tracing as well as miscellaneous operations including multiple
        versions management.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        1. What is the input data?
        --------------------------

        A multi-level directory structure of source files in FORTRAN 77 
        or FORTRAN 90 (as long as you write only external procedures):

        ...../project/dir_1/files
                     /dir_2/files  .h or .F or .anything!
                     /dir_2/dir_2a
                     /dir_2/dir_2a/files
                     /dir_2/dir_2b
                     /dir_2/dir_2b/files
                        .
                        ..
                     /dir_n/files

        The only restriction is that the top level directory project should
        only contain directories and no files for esthetic reasons (and...
        for multiple versions management, see below)!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        2. What do you retrieve?
        ------------------------

        You retrieve the matching architecture of directories with HTML
        files under:

        $WWWROOT/project/dir_1/files.html
                        /dir_2/dir_2a
                        /dir_2/dir_2a/files.html
                        /dir_2/dir_2b
                        /dir_2/dir_2b/files.html
                          ..
                        /dir_n/files.html
                        /data_1/STOxxx.html files for datatype data_1
                          ..
                        /data_m/STOxxx.html files for datatype data_m
                         main.html  (main entry point)
                         index.html  (top level index)
                        /F2HDico/index.html  (dictionary of modules)

        Hypertexted features are:

                - calling sequences
                - functions
                - backward dependencies
                - variables with status ( argument, read-write use)
                - expand mechanism
                - miscellaneous job mechanism

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        3. Installing Fortran2html
        --------------------------

        A) gunzip and untar the Fortran2html tar file, you retrieve 
           the following contents:

        ./README                the file you are reading

        ./INSTALL               install procedure

        ./bin/f2h_back          job to retrieve original source file
        ./bin/f2h_cgiexpj       job for the cgi-bin location
        ./bin/f2h_cgiexpr       job for the cgi-bin location
        ./bin/f2h_cgijob        job for the cgi-bin location
        ./bin/f2h_cgirun        job for the cgi-bin location
        ./bin/f2h_cgisrc        job for the cgi-bin location
        ./bin/f2h_cgivar        job for the cgi-bin location
        ./bin/f2h_create        main job for creating the html database
        ./bin/f2h_diffcreate    alternative create job with incremental diff
                                between multiple versions

        ./images/               several gif buttons
        ./conf/fort_datp.conf   FORTRAN datatypes and hash values (cf 4)
        ./conf/fort_keyw.conf   FORTRAN keywords

        ./include/              temporarily empty directory

        ./src/*.c *.h           kernel programs of f2h scripts
        ./src/makefile          guess what? edit for changing CC env.

        B) Then run the ./INSTALL procedure which copy scripts and compile
        some of the programs and define the common paths for the f2h scripts
        which are by default:

        HTTPDIR   /usr/users/W3   Http stuff main location
                                  overwritten by the -h option

        CGIBIN    /cgi-bin        cgi binaries location (local path)
                                  overwritten by the -c option

        WWWPATH   $HOME/WWW       central location of WWW stuff
                                  overwritten by the -w option

        BACKPATH  Cycles          extension to WWWPATH for f2h outputs
                                  overwritten by the -b option

        TMPWD     /tmp/f2html     tmp working directory
                                  overwritten by the -t option

        F2HPATH   $PWD            when running INSTALL

        BIN       $F2HPATH/bin    should be added to PATH env variable

        Note that the CGI-BIN scripts repository is defined twice:
                - through the CGI internal env variable defined as
                  CGI=$HTTPDIR/cgi-bin
                - through the local path for http references:
                  CGIBIN=/cgi-bin       (standard location) or 
                  CGIBIN=/login/cgi-bin (user's private location) or
                  CGIBIN=/~login/cgi-bin (global access to user's home)

        WARNING: do not forget the slash at the beginning of CGIBIN.

        *CgiParse* should be installed under $HTTPDIR/bin
        *CgiParse* is a public domain http CERN tool.

        C) Go to the location of the ascii version of your project and
           then run the f2h_create job with the project name (which is
           also the root directory name of the project!) as argument.

                % cd ~/src
                % ls
                test cy13.4 cy14
                % f2h_create -d cy14 > ~/tmp/out_cy14 2>&1 &

           Other optional arguments are:

                -n : to give a project name different of the root dir name
                     ex: f2h_create -d cy14 -n cycle_14

        That's All Folks !!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        4. Cross references and f2h_diffcreate
        --------------------------------------

        Fortran2html 4.o handles multiple versions of the same source file
        inside the same "project". It could be usefull for:

        - a project with its bugfix

        - a project built whith multiple releases of the same sources

        - mixing of several projects with a non-null intersection

        Multiple versions of the same module are taken into account whatever
        their location are. However, it appears that in most of the cases,
        users define their versions as the first level of directories.
        According to this condition, the f2h_diffcreate script scans the
        original source location and perform an incremental diff according
        to the hierarchy of versions given in the "-l filename" argument.
        Then a call to f2h_create is automatically performed. Note that
        there is no file removing mechanism in the f2h_diffcreate mechanism:
        a temporary directory is created and links are established with
        selected elements of the original source location.
        
        Example: the original code structure is:

                myproject/version1/src
                                  /include
                         /version2/src
                                  /src/level2
                                  /include
                         /version3/src/
                                  /include

        the priority list file should be something like:

        version3
        version2
        version1

        so that only version3 files which differ from version2 will be
        selected and version2 files which differ from version0. The
        last directory of the list and any directory which is not in this
        list will be completly selected.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        5. Customizing FORTRAN datatypes:
        ---------------------------------

        Before the step C of the previous sequence, you may wish to
        redefine the default datatype classification which is the
        DOCTOR norm with some adjustments.

        The conf/fort_datp.conf file must always have 3 columns:
        
                - prefix of the variable
                - datatype full name (name of the futur directory)
                - hash value for storage purpose

        A special line define the default datatype.

        The line ordering is very important, since the last test is
        the one retained! For example, you may classify your variables 
        beginning with the a "c" character (it's not case sensitive, so 
        that the first column must be written with lowercase!) as follow:

        c       Char                    32
        cd      None                    0
        cl      None                    0
        clim    CLIM_Constant           8
        =def=   Real                    16
        
        meaning that a variable beginning with a "c" is a global character
        variable, unless it begins with "cd" or "cl" and therefore is a 
        local variable unless it begins with "clim" and then it's a
        constant.

        The "hash" value defines the number of files that will be created
        to store the variables of the matching datatype. The higher the
        number of variable is, the higher the "hash" value should be. But
        the higher this value is, and the longer the execution time will be 
        to produce the hypertexted image.

        Note that f2h_create checks for a fort_datp.$project file first,
        and if none is available, selects the default fort_datp.conf file.
        In any case, at the end of f2h_create, a fort_datp.$project file
        exists in the conf directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        6. Retrieving the original source code
        --------------------------------------

        By clicking on the [SRC] link (at the top of each file) you can
        retrieve a work copy of the original source code whitout any HTML
        extension.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        7. The job submission form
        --------------------------

        At the top of each element file, the [JOB] link opens the job
        submission form to perform a miscellaneous processing on the
        current element and its alternate versions.

        A @ (with spaces around) in the command line is replaced by all the 
        selected versions. If no @ is present in the command line, the
        versions are added at the end of the command.

        By default, there is no active pre-selected command. The preselected
        command are:
                a. diff ( unix diff between 2 files )
                b. diff3 ( unix diff between 3 files )
                c. diffbc ( diff performed only if differences are not blanks
                            and not commentaries )
                d. xterm ( spawns a xtern in the job working directory
                           including original source copies of selected
                           versions )
                e. vi ( same as xterm but automaticaly performs vi @ )

        WARNING: options d and e request your display to be present in
        - - - -  the command line.

        examples:
                - "for file in @ ; do echo $file; cut -f2- $file; done"
                - "myscreen" (xterm selected, perform 
                               xterm -display myscreen:0.0)

        WARNING: when executing a command through the Common Gateway Interface
        - - - -  you take the logname and permission of the "adm" login (or
                 something like this), so that you loose all your favorite
                 environment. The root manager should also be aware of this
                 gateway in the unix system security.
                 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        8. The expand mechanism
        -----------------------

        When selecting [CPP] at the top of a source file code, a page
        is open where default include files are activated according
        to the current version of the file to expand. One can switch
        to other versions if any. The expand mechanism is performed through
        the cpp utility. 

        The default CPP variable is set to

                CPP="/lib/cpp -P"

        in the f2h_cgiexpr script. Feel free to modify it if necessary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        9. Search variable mechanisms
        -----------------------------

        Only the variables which match the definitions of the fort_datp.conf
        file are statically referenced. As an example, according to rules
        coding, you can reference only the global variables (F77 common) of
        your sources.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        10. Warnings and bugs
        ---------------------

        - Do not forget to add the F2HBIN path in your .profile.

        - Include file names enclosed between single quotes (') after the
INCLUDE Fortran keyword are not recognized. Use a double quote or the
#include cpp statement.

        - Multiple subroutines inside a single source file cause serious 
          troubles.

        - It could happen that your *awk* command is not really up to date.
Very often the *nawk* command is then available so that you must alias
awk to /bin/nawk (or /usr/bin/nawk) for a proper use.

        - Your umask is set to 22 at the beginning of f2h_create.

<title>Debian Install</title>

<h1>Debian Linux: Anatomy of a Successful Install</h1>

<hr>

<h2>What is Debian?</h2>

<p>Debian is a fairly recent distribution of Linux. Debian was an official
Free Software Foundation (GNU) project, but now is independent. The current
stable version is 1.2. "Debian" comes from "Deb and Ian Murdock;" Ian is
Debian's original developer.</p>

<p>I originally installed Debian 0.93, a beta release. Debian is now
officially released, an install manual is available, and the installation
tools are in much better shape than when I originally installed it. This
site is obsolete in many respects, but may still be useful, especially
to anyone upgrading from an older version of Debian.</p>

<p>For more information:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian Organization</a></li>

<li><A HREF="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/">FTP archive at
ftp.debian.org</a>

<li><A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/linux.html">The Linux Documentation
Project</a>

<li>the <a href="news:linux.debian.user">linux.debian.user</a> news group
or the debian-user mailing list (subscribe at
<a
href="mailto:debian-user-request@pixar.com">debian-user-request@pixar.com</a>);
the newsgroup mirrors the list (read-only).

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>And who are you?</h2>

<p>I am currently systems team leader (sysadmin/netadmin/etc.) at
<a href="http://www.gulf.net/">Gulf Coast Internet Company</a>,
and I maintain a Web server on the side as
<a href="/">Scimitar Internet Services</a>.</p>

<p>I installed Debian on my <a href="system.html">home computer</a>, not the
one running this web server.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Install</h2>

<p>My successful installation of Debian involved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="disks.html">Obtaining the boot/root/base disks</a></li>
<li><a href="diskpart.html">Repartitioning my hard drive</a></li>
<li><a href="boot.html">Booting Debian and installing the base system</a></li>
<li><a href="net.html">Obtaining and installing the network packages</a></li>
<li><a href="packages.html">Obtaining and installing other packages</a></li>
<li><a href="other.html">Obtaining and installing non-Debian software</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>The Upgrade</h2>

<p>Recently I upgraded to the Debian 1.1.2 release, ELF binaries and
the Linux 2.0.6 kernel. While a bit more troublesome than I had hoped,
it was accomplished quite easily thanks to Debian's packaging system.</p>

<p>The main stumbling blocks were:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The package format changed incompatibly, so I had to first upgrade
from my old dpkg to an intermediate version, then from the intermediate
version to the latest version.</p>

<li><p>There are some sketchy upgrade notes on the Debian FTP site,
be sure to read them before upgrading from 0.93.</p>
</ol>

<p>OK, so I always start things and never finish them. I really
create web places like this just to have a place to put things.
I don't intend to <em>really</em> have a series of party tips

<h1>What is a scimitar?</h1>

<p>A scimitar is a short curved sword once used in the Middle East. I chose the
name for Scimitar Internet Services for no particular reason. It just
sounded good (connotations of speed and power).</p>

<p>A few other uses of the word scimitar:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><a
href="http://vh.radiology.uiowa.edu/GrandRounds/PedsChest/chest.html"><b>Scimitar</b>
syndrome</a> (<i>med.</i>): a pulmonary development anomaly</p>

<li><p>Shakespeare.</p>

<p>From <cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite>, <a
href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/Comedy/TC/TC.5.1.html">Act 5 Scene
1</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ACHILLES: I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,
Which with my <b>scimitar</b> I'll cool to-morrow.
Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <cite>Titus and Andronicus</cite>, <a
href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/Tragedy/Titus/Titus.4.2.html">Act 4
Scene 2</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AARON: Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?
     Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,
     That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
     He dies upon my <b>scimitar's</b> sharp point
     That touches this my first-born son and heir!</p>
</blockquote>

<li><p>a high-performance engineering <a

<li><p>Part of the symbol for the <a
href="gopher://ftp.cac.psu.edu/00/genealogy/roots-l/FAQ.MASON">Shriners</a></p>

<li><p>From <cite>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DENNIS:  Well you can't expect to wield supreme executive power
just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!</p>

<p>ARTHUR:  Shut up!</p>

<p>DENNIS:  I mean, if I went around sayin' I was an emperor just because
some moistened bint had lobbed a <b>scimitar</b> at me they'd put me away!</p>
</blockquote>

<li><p>A model of car from Reliant Motors Ltd. (UK).</p></li>

<p>Amazing what you can find on the Web, isn't it?</p>

<title>Waco</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 28 - April 19, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<!-- To be checked:
	FBI jammed TV/radio signals during siege (CNN 4/20/93 11:40am EDT,
		Dallas Morning News 4/17/93, 4/18/93);
	FBI bugged Mt.Carmel during siege (DMN 4/21/93)
	Davidians on 3/14/93 flashed "SOS SOS SOS FBI BROKE NEGOTIATIONS"
		with light beacon (AP), then FBI used stadium lights/tanks
		to block view of signal;
	FBI said they planned to knock down Davidians' ham radio station
		(Atlanta Journal, 3/5/93)
	###
	Should really add more links to Reavis' Ashes of Waco pages.
-->

<!-- Should have a lie-by-lie refutation:

	House hearings: BATF testified Davidians "sprayed" machine guns,
	.50 caliber rifles and grenades. At trial, FBI admitted no spent
	.50 bullets were found.

	House hearings: BATF testified Davidians outgunned BATF's "pop guns".
	"Pop guns" included 9mm, AR-15s, MP-5 submachine guns, Blackhawk
	helicopter.

	"Ambush". BATF was the one attacking; BATF knew Davidians knew
	they were coming; BATF agents seen shooting out in the open
	during raid. BATF practiced repeatedly in mock raids at Ft. Hood
	under Special Forces training.

	House hearings (Kiri Jewell), standoff, etc.: BATF/FBI claimed
	Koresh abused children. DoJ admitted not enough evidence to
	indict Koresh; Jewell's father tried to make money by putting
	her on the talk show circuit and sell her story for a TV movie;
	counselors who interviewed surviving Davidian children found
	no evidence of abuse.

	Davidians were suicidal/committed suicide. Transcripts, trial
	testimony, survivors' testimony.

	FBI wanted peaceful surrender. Lights/noises, fake tank passes,
	destruction of property, superiors telling negotiators to justify
	aggression.

<h1>Remember Waco</h1>

<p>The federal government's military assault of a religious residence near
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>, was one of
the most egregious abuses of power witnessed in
the U.S. in this century.</p>

<p>On February 28, 1993, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF)
conducted a military assault of the living quarters of the Branch Davidians,
a small Christian church once associated with the Seventh-Day Adventists.
After a fifty-one-day siege, the Davidians' home burned, killing over eighty
men, women and children.</p>

<p>What happened?</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="motive/">BATF wanted to make an example of the Davidians.</a></dt>
<dd><p>BATF used some valid concerns to further their agenda of increasing
their budget and disarming American citizens.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="raid/">BATF used excessive force.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Instead of peacably serving a search warrant, the BATF lied in order to
get military support, then attacked the Davidians with overwhelming firepower,
leaving the Davidians no option but to defend themselves or be killed.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="siege/">The FBI's siege confirmed Davidians' fears.</a></dt>
<dd><p>During the long siege, the FBI cut off utilities, blared recordings of
rabbits being slaughtered, refused to allow family members to talk with the
Davidians, and otherwise confirmed the Davidian's view that the federal
government meant to kill them.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="fire/">The federal government started the fire and made sure the
	Davidians died in it.</a></dt>
<dd><p>The FBI pumped an inflammable gas into a building lit with kerosene
lanterns, then knocked down walls and blocked exits.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="coverup/">Government agencies covered up evidence of agents'
	wrongdoing.</a></dt>
<dd><p>The press were kept away from the scene; the building was immediately
demolished; key evidence disappeared; several feet of topsoil was removed
from the site.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="trial/">Surviving Davidians were found innocent of murder.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Despite dirty tricks by the prosecution, a jury found that surviving
Davidians acted in self-defense and were as such innocent of murder and
conspiracy to murder. Six Davidians are appealing convictions on lesser
charges.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="reaction/">The Waco tragedy stirred tremendous antigovernment
	sentiment.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Seeing federal agents abuse their authority with impunity, average
Americans began to fear their government. Both the House and Senate
held hearings on the Waco incident. Imprisoned Davidians appealed their
sentences.</p></dd>

<dt>Federal agencies should be required to use local police for
	actual enforcement.</dt>
<dd><p>To reduce the situations that made Waco likely, federal police
should be prohibited from carrying weapons, instead being confined to an
investigative role, and relying on local law enforcement for searches and
arrests.</p></dd>

<p>A 1995 study by Merrill Lynch says that "depending on where you live,
federal, state, and local taxes can consume nearly half your income." For
example, the study estimates that individuals in the top income bracket in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York
City</a> can pay 47.1% of their income in taxes; 46.2% in <a

and 46.8% in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ma/">Massachusetts</a>.</p>

<h1>Community and Social Issues</h1>

<p>Functional, satisfying communities are built by the efforts of
everyone in them to achieve common goals. The trend in the 20th century
to nationalize all social issues takes responsibility away from
local groups, puts control in the hands of people far removed from
the actual problems, and results in a one-size-fits-all approach
that is inappropriate to the great diversity of human community.</p>

<p>Libertarians support having private organizations rather than
government trying to solve social problems.</p>

<h1>Controlling Your Own Body</h1>

<p>Libertarians believe you should have control over your own body. Although
this seems obvious, all other political groups want to control what substances
you can put into your body, what you can take out of it, how you maintain it
and what you and other consenting people do with it.</p>

<h1>Sexual and Reproductive Freedom</h1>

<p>Reproductive (or sexual) freedom covers many issues, including birth
control, sexual preference, abortion and forced sterilization. Libertarians
are divided on the abortion issue (depends on whether one considers the fetus
an individual); the Libertarian Party platform is pro-choice.</p>

<h1>Drug Policy</h1>

<dl>

<dt><a href="moral/">Drug prohibition is morally wrong.</a></dt>
<dd><p>With origins in bigotry and racism, and sustained by the use of force,
drug prohibition is a violation of the most basic human rights.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="usage/">Prohibition affects drug usage for the worse.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Prohibition leads to more dangerous drugs, and has a "forbidden fruit"
effect, but whether lax or tough has little effect on patterns of drug
usage.</p>

<dt><a href="users/">Drug users are worse off under prohibition.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Although intended to protect people from drugs, prohibition worsens the
situation of drug users, increasing criminality and health problems.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="sellers/">Drug sellers are more dangerous under
	prohibition.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Prohibition enriches the worst criminals and leads to more
violence.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="legal/">Prohibition corrupts the judicial system.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Due to prohibition's nature, drug enforcement inevitably leads to
overburdened courts and jails, fewer resources devoted against violent crime,
and corruption at all levels.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="rights/">Prohibition leads to destruction of other
	liberties.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Faced with failure, prohibitionists seek more and more infringements
of individual liberties, from restricting speech to banning guns, from
more intrusive searches to higher taxes.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="effects/">Prohibition deprives us of beneficial drug use.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Prohibition discourages promising drug research, denies medically
proven uses of recreational drugs, eliminates beneficial industrial uses
of drug sources. Relying on an image of evil drugs, prohibition propaganda
spreads ignorance of the true effects of drugs.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="critics/">Prohibition's critics come from all viewpoints.</a></dt>
<dd><p>As prohibition's failure becomes evident, voices from all points on the
political spectrum speak out against it, from Nobel Prize-winning economists
to conservative columnists and former police chiefs.</p></dd>

<h1>Freedom of Expression</h1>

<p>One of the most fundamental of our freedoms is that summarized by the First
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: freedom of expression.</p>

<p>Freedom of expression includes everything listed in the First Amendment --
freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom of
petition and freedom of assembly. Unfortunately the founding fathers couldn't
see into the future, and so omitted an equally important aspect of freedom of
expression: freedom of communication in any form, including broadcast and
electronic.</p>

<p>Closely tied to freedom of expression is privacy of communication.</p>

<p>Libertarians support the peaceable free exercise of religion, and the
separation of church and state. (And the separation of just about everything
else and state, for that matter.) When religions attempt to legislate their
beliefs, or commit violence, they are no longer peacably exercising their
rights, but violating others' rights.</p>

<h1>Firearms and Crime</h1>

<p>One of the most common reasons for gun ownership is as a deterrent to
crime. Gun grabbers claim that guns cause crime rather than deter it.
Where do the facts stand? Read on.</p>

<p>The obsolesence of self-defense is one of the great myths of our time.

<title>Militia</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Citizen Militia Movement</h1>

<p>The true purpose of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is to
preserve the concept of the citizen militia, an armed citizenry willing
and able to defend its rights against enemies foreign and domestic.</p>

<p>Citizen militia have a long history. For most of human history and
pre-history, countries had no standing armies, but instead relied on all
able-bodied males to take arms when necessary to defend the community. Rather
than being obsoleted by modern technology and industrial civilization,
militia can now easily include anyone who wishes to help, including women
and the elderly.</p>

<p>With the recent rise of gun control legislation, a grass-roots movement
has arisen to reclaim the tradition of the citizen militia. Some of the modern
militia movement is rooted in libertarianism; some in conservatism; some in
fringe groups such as survivalists and racists.</p>

<title>The Politics of Firearms</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Politics of Firearms</h1>

<p>Efforts at gun control are misguided or even totalitarian in intent.
Gun control proponents often resort to <a href="grabbers.html">perpetuating
myths and lies</a> to gain support.</p>

<p>Gun owners should prefer <a href="lvr.html">Libertarians over Republicans</a>
based on principle and pragmatism.</p>

<p>Gun grabbers like to parade around a few police chiefs and other law
enforcement officials to demonstrate their support for each new round
of gun control. Survey after survey, however, has found that the vast
majority of police support gun ownership and oppose gun control.</p>

<p>Granted, many of these surveys are not scientific, and I don't
particularly care what any government official thinks of my inherent
and inalienable rights. However, gun grabbers routinely and purposely
perpetuate a myth that cops support gun control, and they don't.</p>

<p>Most police support individual firearm ownership, as evidenced by</p>

<title>Jury Rights</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Jury Rights</h1>

<p>The reason that we have juries decide guilt and innocence is that you can't
trust the government. Juries guard against injustice in two ways: by being
disinterested parties, and by having the authority to decide guilt or
innocence regardless of the instructions of the judge or the law. This latter
right is called jury nullification and is a well-established legal
principle.</p>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/FIJA.html">Fully Informed Jury
Association (FIJA)</a> seeks to inform jurors of this
right, in the hopes of having unjust laws nullified.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="sentence.html">Jury can know possible sentencing</a>
<li><a href="ca_order.html">California Courts Prohibit Jury Leafletting</a>

<title>Libertarian Philosophy Books</title>

<h1>Books on Libertarian Philosophy</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/TFranklinHarrisJr.html">T. Franklin
Harris Jr.</a>, Critic-at-Large, <cite>The Exchange: Culture,
Reason, Style</cite>:</p>

<p>The following is a list of books on libertarian philosophy -- or, more 
properly, philosophical defenses of libertarianism. It is not meant to be 
exhaustive, but, rather, is meant to reflect the best examples of 
philosophical libertarianism as defended by various philosophical 
standpoints: Aristotelianism, contractarianism, intuitionism, 
utilitarianism, etc. It is also limited (of course) by my own knowledge 
of the libertarian canon. For instance, I am largely unfamiliar with 
various Kantian defences of libertarianism, apart from the works of 
Hans-Hermann Hoppe included below.</p>

<p>I hope this list will help libertarians -- and, by extension, 
non-libertarians -- become more familiar with the moral basis for their 
beliefs and where that basis may or may not be lacking or in need of 
further thought. As Bastiat said, the worst thing that can happen to a 
good idea is, not to be skillfully attacked, but ineptly defended.</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href="/revolution/by_name/N/JanNarveson.html">Narveson, Jan</a>,
	<cite>The Libertarian Idea</cite> (<a
	href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/Philadelphia.html">Philadelphia</a>:
	Temple University Press, 1988)</dt>
<dd><p>Narveson's book is one of the overlooked treasures of the libertarian 
canon. In this critic's opinion, his contractarian defense of liberty -- 
based largely on Hobbesian philosophy -- is the best defense of 
libertarianism currently available. Narveson utilizes game theory and 
value subjectivism to breath new life into the social contract.</p>

<p>The one major flaw in the book is Narveson's section on health care in
which Narveson seems to claim that it is possible to defend a national
health care system with the confines of libertarian moral theory. 
(Narveson, it should be noted, no longer holds this view.) But,
nevertheless, ignore this one unfortunate section, and you will find
Narveson's account inspiring.</p>

<dt><a href="/revolution/by_name/N/RobertNozick.html">Nozick, Robert</a>,
	<cite>Anarchy, State, and Utopia</cite> (New York: Basic Books,
	1974)</dt>
<dd><p>In professional philosophical circles, Nozick's work is regarded as
<em>the</em> definitive defense of libertarianism. Other libertarians --
myself included -- find his intuitionist defense of liberty lacking to say the
least. Still, because of the book's reputation, it is important for
libertarians to be familiar with <cite>Anarchy, State, and Utopia</cite>.</p>

<dt>Hoppe, Hans-Hermann, <cite>A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism</cite>
	(Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1989) and <cite>The Economics
	and Ethics of Private Property</cite> (Boston: Kluwer Academic
	Publishers, 1993)</dt>
<dd><p>Hoppe's Kantian defense of liberty rests upon the argument that it is 
illogical for one to argue against liberty as doing so places one with a 
logical contradiction. Hoppe argues that the ability to argue presupposes 
self-ownership, which presupposes an absolute right to private property.</p>

<p>So far, only Murray Rothbard has announced that he agrees with Hoppe. 
I remain unconvinced. Still, his work is useful and (depending upon your 
view) instructive in either how or how not to do logic.</p>

<dt><a href="/revolution/by_name/R/MurrayRothbard.html">Rothbard, Murray
	N.</a>, <cite>For a New Liberty: The Libertarian
	Manifesto</cite> (New York: Libertarian Review Foundation, 1978) and
	<cite>Power and Market: Government and the Economy</cite> (Kansas City:
	Sheed Andrews and McMeel, Inc., 1977)</dt>
<dd><p>Half the time Rothbard sounds like <a
href="/revolution/by_name/R/AynRand.html">Ayn Rand</a> (and other Aristotelians 
listed below), while the rest of the time he sounds like Hoppe. The mix 
of Aristotelian and Kantian philosophy seems incoherent to me but not, it 
seems, to most other libertarians. Apart from Ayn Rand, Rothbard is the 
most infuential libertarian theorist, thus, his works are essential reading.</p>

<dt>Merrill, Ronald E., <cite>The Ideas of Ayn Rand</cite> (La Salle, Ill.:
	Open Court, 1991)</dt>
<dd><p>Merrill provides the best critical introduction currently available to 
the philosophy of <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/AynRand.html">Ayn Rand</a>.
For my purpose here, his book is better than 
Rand's own, as Merrill provides a detailed discussion of how Rand's 
"Objectivist" philosophy relates to the modern libertarian movement.</p>

<dt>Tannehill, Morris and Linda, <cite>The Market for Liberty</cite> (New York:
	Libertarian Review Foundation, 1984)</dt>
<dd><p>The Tannehills' near-classic book is the best introduction to the 
anarcho-Randian viewpoint -- that is, anarcho-capitalism as defended by 
the philosophy of Ayn Rand. Rand, however, disagreed violently with the 
anarcho-capitalist view.</p>

<dt><a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">Friedman, David</a>,
	<cite>The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical 
	Capitalism</cite> (La Salle, Ill.: Open Court, 1989)</dt>
<dd><p>David Friedman, son of economist Milton Friedman, presents the best 
defense of the anarcho-capitalist version of libertarianism available. 
(Although his discussions of moral theory are, I think, simplistic and 
self-defeating.) Friedman never shys away from the hard questions -- 
including the one with which anarcho-capitalists always have trouble: 
national defense.</p>

<dt>Machan, Tibor R., <cite>Individuals and Their Rights</cite> (La Salle,
	Ill.: Open Court, 1989) and <cite>The Virtue of Liberty</cite>
	(Irvington-on-Hudson, NY: Foundation for Economic Education, Inc.,
	1994) and <cite>Human Rights and Human Liberties: A Radical
	Reconsideration of the American Political Tradition</cite>
(<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>:
	Nelson Hall, 1975)</dt>
<dd><p>Machan presents the most scholarly and coherent case for the Randian
defense of liberty available. <cite>The Virtue of Liberty</cite>, in
particular, is a very good introduction to libertarianism. Machan, however,
typically casts Hobbesian libertarianism in an unjustified bad light --
usually with straw man arguments that, while they may apply to Hobbes's own
philophophy, don't necessarily apply to the philosophy of present-day Hobbesian
libertarians.</p>

<dt>Rasmussen, Douglas B. and Douglas J. Den Uyl, <cite>Liberty and Nature: An 
	Aristotelian Defense of Liberal Order</cite> (La Salle, Ill.: Open
	Court, 1991)</dt>
<dd><p>This book seems to have replaced (if only in libertarian circles) 
Nozick's as <em>the</em> book of libertarian philosophy. It is, perhaps, the 
most technical of all the book's I've listed -- sometimes, I think, 
overly so. And while I don't agree that Aristotelianism is either right 
or of use in defending liberty, the book is still full of insight.</p.

<p>Of particular note is the discussion of rights as "meta-normative" 
concepts -- a discussion that, I think, actually leads one to the 
conclusion that <em>any</em> teleological moral system (not just 
Aristotelianism) presupposes libertarian rights to life, liberty, and 
property.</p>

<h1>Politics</h1>

<p>Ah, politics. That's what we're here for, isn't it? Perhaps
the reason libertarians have had such limited success politically
is that most libertarians would rather do <em>anything</em>
other than politics.</p>

<title>Libertarian Activism: Strategy and Tactics</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: contemporary -->
</head>
<body>

<h1>Libertarian Activism: Strategy and Tactics</h1>

<p>Sometime around 1991, Libertarian activist
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a> began
a series of tips, tactics, strategies, and case studies that became
known as "Tom's Tips" and proved invaluable to activists across
the country trying to learn how to grow their parties and run
campaigns. This web page has grown from that effort and now includes
articles from many people.</p>

<p>The premier resource for Libertarian activists is the outstanding
newsletter <cite>Libertarian Volunteer</cite>, edited by LP Communications
Director <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill Winter</a>.
It is simply the best newsletter in the libertarian movement. It is
written for LP volunteers, activists, officers, and candidates. If you are
one of those, send your request to Bill Winter to get on that mailing
list.</p>

<body>

<h1>About Revolution</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/"><b>Revolution</b></a> provides
<font size=+1>intellectual ammunition</font>
to everyone fighting for more freedom around the
<A href="/revolution/by_place/">world</a> -- the peaceful revolution
of ideas and technology. Revolution is
a <a href="search.html">searchable</a> collection of facts, arguments
and statistics furthering the libertarian
idea of individuals freely collaborating in society.</p>

<p>I (<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/KenGaillotJr.html">Ken Gaillot</a>)
maintain this site in my spare time, which unfortunately is not very
abundant. As a result, I do not get to add all the information I would
like, and I do not get to respond to all the email I receive. I do read
every suggestion and try to incorporate them into the site.</p>

<p>If you have comments, corrections or information
you wish to be added, fill out the <a href="comments.html">comment form</a>
or send e-mail to <img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:scimitar@scimitar.com">scimitar@scimitar.com</a>.</p>

<p><a href="sponsors/">Sponsorship</a> is available.</p>

<H2>Tips</H2>

<p><b>Revolution</b> uses Excite for Web Servers, a concept-based
searching engine.</p>

<p>A query is simply a description of what you are looking for. If
you do a keyword search, Excite will return documents that have those
words in them. If you do a concept search, Excite does a more intelligent
search, returning documents that contain those words and related words.</p>

<DL>
<p>
<DT><B>Only use words that are relevant to your query</B></dt>
<DD>If you're looking for documents about the Widget2000, don't enter a
query like "<CODE>Find me all documents about the Widget2000</CODE>".
Excite for Web Servers considers <I>all</I> the words in your query to be
part of your information need, so queries like the previous example will
find all documents about <I>finding all documents about</I> the Widget2000,
which may not be exactly what you want.</dd>
<P>
<DT><B>Specify multiple forms of the same phrases</B>
<DD>Excite for Web Servers distinguishes between hyphenated and
un-hyphenated words. So, sometimes it might be necessary to explicitly say
that you want both versions, for example "<CODE>CDROM CD-ROM</CODE>". Excite
for Web Servers will try to figure out that <CODE>CDROM</CODE> and
<CODE>CD-ROM</CODE> are the same, but it never hurts to explicitly specify
multiple forms.</dd>
<P>
<DT><B>Common words are ignored</B>
<DD>Excite for Web Servers doesn't index common words like <I>a</I>,
<I>and</I>, or <I>the</I>.  Consequently, those words in your query will
be ignored. Excite for Web Servers also ignores numbers; however, it can
find strings that happen to contain a number, for example <I>3Com</I>.

<title>Blind Boy Fuller</title>

<table border>
<tr><th><b>Artist</b></th> <td>Blind Boy Fuller</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Title</b></th> <td><cite>East Coast Piedmont Style</cite></td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Dates</b></th> <td>1935 - 1939</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Label</b></th> <td>Columbia (Roots'n'Blues series)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>North Carolina, the 1930's. A street musician plays the blues for
local tobacco factory workers and city crowds of Durham. Thanks to
new-fangled recording technology, this link in the blues experience
was preserved for posterity. Columbia here reissues much of Blind Boy
Fuller's work as part of its Roots'n'Blues series.</p>

<p>Fulton Allen (1907 - 1941) went blind by age 22, and became a street
musician to help support himself and his young wife. A local record store
owner recorded him and sold the recordings to the American Record Company
(ARC), which released the songs on the Vocalion label. Not believing the name
Fulton Allen could sell records, the store owner rechristened Allen "Blind
Boy Fuller."</p>

<p>The sound here is typical of 1930's blues recordings: mostly just
Fuller on vocals and guitar, occasionally accompanied by washboard,
harmonica or another guitar.</p>

<p>In stark contrast to the moody, personal blues of contemporary
<a href="johnson.html">Robert Johnson</a>, Fuller's songs are mainly
upbeat, party blues, closer to the later rollicking blues of
<a href="dixon.html">Willie Dixon</a>. The typical "I'm a Rattlesnakin'
Daddy" is perhaps the best song in this collection, and other rocking tunes
include "Rag Mama Rag," "Baby You Gotta Change Your Mind" and
"You've Got Something There."</p>

<p>Fuller does have his share of the blues though, in "Ain't It a Cryin'
Shame" and "Walking My Troubles Away:"</p>
<blockquote>
I got coffee grinds in my coffee<br>
Boll weevils in my meal<br>
Tacks in my shoes keep on sticking my heel<br>
I keep on walking, walking my troubles away
</blockquote>

<p>The blues is not so much a music form as a contagious disease.
The basic elements of the blues, whether pieces of lyrics, or riffs,
or bass lines, can be heard in all blues recordings from the earliest
to today's. Blues artists borrow -- are infected by --
these elements, building on them, reworking them, enhancing them. No
blues artist is truly original but the best make it seem like it.</p>

<p>Fuller here borrows from many sources, including Blind Willie McTell
(what exactly is it about blindness and the blues?). In turn, Fuller's
songs can be heard in later musician's work. Howlin Wolf's "Sitting on
Top of the World" sounds much like Fuller's "I'm Climbin' On Top of the
Hill." "Cryin' Shame" was redone by many artists, including
country singer Merle Haggard. Lightnin' Hopkins' style often sounds
similar to Fuller's slower pieces.</p>

<p>Sexual innuendo plays a leading role in Fuller's lyrics. "Rattlesnakin'
Daddy," "Sweet Honey Hole," "Black and Tan" and "Big Leg Woman Gets My Pay"
are all lighthearted frolics. The recurring blues theme of infidelity
gets its play here as well, in "Keep Away From My Woman," "Cat Man Blues"
and "Untrue Blues."</p>

<blockquote>
I rattle to the left<br>
I rattle to the right<br>
My sweet little woman says I can rattle all night<br>
Cuz I'm a rattlesnakin' daddy<br>
</blockquote>

<h2>Robert Johnson: <cite>The Complete Recordings</cite></h2>

<table border>
<tr><th><b>Artist</b></th> <td>Robert Johnson</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Title</b></th> <td><cite>The Complete Recordings</cite></td></tr>

</table>

<p>Not many people know about Robert Johnson, but almost everyone knows
about this 1930's bluesman's songs. His works can be found recreated by
Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, the Red Hot Chili Peppers
and numerous other artists. Unfortunately, the only recorded legacy of
this master is from a handful of 1936 and 1937 sessions and fits on
two CDs.</p>

<p>Columbia has put together this collection of all 41 known Robert Johnson
recordings, including second takes, as part of its "Roots'n'Blues Series."
The songs come from 1936 and 1937 Texas sessions for the American Record
Company (ARC), which released eleven of the songs on the Vocalion label.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes the modern ear upon playing this set
is the poor quality of recordings. At the time, the height of technology
was the microphone, and over the many decades since, the original source
recording has deteriorated somewhat.</p>

<p>Once you overcome the distraction of the hiss and poor sound, you enter
a mystical world seeming to mark the connection between earth and hell.
Johnson's voice is a banshee's wail, and his guitar a caged demon.</p>

<p>Johnson's recordings are some of the most original in known blues history.
Despite borrowing a few lines or riffs here and there, Johnson lends a
profoundly distinctive sound and lyricism to the genre. His songs formed
the basis for future schools of blues, soul and rock musicians. Many of the
songs here have been redone by more well known artists -- "Crossroad
Blues" (Eric Clapton), "Dust My Broom" (Elmore James, Z.Z. Top),
"Love in Vain" (Rolling Stones), "Traveling Riverside Blues" (Led Zeppelin),
"Sweet Home Chicago" (Blues Brothers) and "They're Red Hot" (Red
Hot Chili Peppers), for example. Robert Plant still borrows
a few Johnson lyrics now and then.</p>

<p>Strangely enough eye trouble seems to be positively correlated with
blues talent. Blind Willie McTell, Blind Boy Fuller, Blind Gary Davis,
Blind Lemon Jefferson, not to mention Ray Charles, were all completely
blind. Johnson dropped out of school because of poor vision and reportedly
had one bad eye.</p>

<blockquote>
I'm going to hoist your hood mama<br>
I'm bound to check your oil
</blockquote>

<p>Automobiles as sexual metaphor are a recurrent theme in modern music,
and Johnson helped start the show with "Terraplane Blues." Shades of this
song would reappear in Led Zeppelin's "Trampled Underfoot."</p>

<blockquote>
I got to keep movin', I got to keep movin'<br>
Blues falling down like hail, Blues falling down like hail<br>
And the days keep worrying me<br>
There's a hellhound on my trail<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Robert Johnson's short life was one of rambling and playing music.
According to legend, Johnson was poisoned by a bar owner when Johnson
spent a little too much time with the bar owner's wife.</p>

<p>The word that blues added to the vocabulary appears
in this blues album as well. In "Little Queen of Spades" Robert sings,
"Everybody say she got a mojo, cause she's been using that stuff."</p>

<blockquote>
You can bury my body<br>
Down by the highway side<br>
So my old evil spirit<br>
Can catch a Greyhound bus, and ride
</blockquote>

<title>John Lee Hooker</title>

</table>

<p>John Lee Hooker is one of the great bluesman of all time,
his Mississippi growl forever stamped upon musical history.
This 1994 compilation of his early recordings provides an
enjoyable sample of get-down-and-boogie blues, including
"Boom Boom," which was immortalized in <cite>The Blues Brothers</cite>.</p>

<p>"When I ran off from home, I was 14 and I didn't want to be no farmer."</p>

<p>John Lee Hooker was born in August 1920 in Clarksdale, Mississippi,
a cousin to another great bluesman, Earl Hooker. As a teenager he ran
away to the big city -- Detroit -- and began singing the blues. He lied
about his age to get into the Army, getting an ID that said he was born
in 1917, causing confusion for historians many years later.</p>

<p>Hooker got his musical start in Detroit, bringing the Mojo to Motown.
His first recording, 1948's "Boogie Chillun!", was also his first hit.
He continued recording for the Vee-Jay label until 1964. Like most
bluesmen of his era, he just kept on singing and recording, winning a
Grammy in 1989.</p>

<p>Retro Music compiled the best of his early music into two CDs --
<cite>Trouble Blues</cite> and <cite>Whiskey and Wimmen</cite> --
sometimes sold separately and sometimes packaged together (best
bargain bin value ever).</p>

<p>The standout selections here are "Boogie Chillun!", "Tupelo",
"Crawlin' Kingsnake", "Whiskey and Wimmen" and "Boom Boom".
"Boogie"'s start-and-stop rythym is catchy and shows up later
in Led Zeppelin's live album <cite>The Song Remains The Same</cite>
("you gotta let that boy boogie ..."). "Tupelo" is a slow, moody
blues history of one of the great Mississippi River floods.</p>

<p>"Crawlin' Kingsnake" is another upbeat blues manifesto, along
the lines of Blind Boy Fuller's "Rattlesnakin' Daddy". "Whiskey
and Wimmen" is a blues lament of the downfall of man, not quite
the Biblical version but more believable.</p>

<p>1962's "Boom Boom" is classic John Lee, the ultimate bad-ass lay-it-down
blues riff (how how how how ...). Hooker's widest recognition would
come when he played "Boom Boom" in the <cite>Blues Brothers</cite> movie.</p>

<p>The other tracks on these albums are also worth listening to,
although a few aren't very noteworthy. The set overall has a muddy,
laid back groove, more like the gritty Texas blues of Lightnin' Hopkins
than the urban Chicago blues of Howlin' Wolf or Muddy Waters.</p>

<title>Willie Dixon</title>

<body>

<h1><a href="/kaleidosound/">kaleidosound</a></h1>
<h2>Willie Dixon: <cite>The Chess Box</cite></h2>

<table border>
<tr><th><b>Artist</b></th> <td>Willie Dixon et al.</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Title</b></th> <td><cite>The Chess Box</cite></td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Dates</b></th> <td>1951 - 1968</td></tr>
<tr><th><b>Label</b></th> <td>Chess</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you could only buy one blues album, what a sorry state that would
be. But you have to start somewhere, and the Dixon box is a great
place to start.</p>

<p>Dixon was the main songwriter behind Chess Records in the '50s and '60s,
and Chess was the main record label behind the Chicago sound. All the
greats recorded Dixon's lyrics, and are represented on this 2-CD set:
Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, Otis Rush, Little Milton and of
course Dixon himself.</p>

<p>Little Walter's deep vocals shine on "My Babe" and "Mellow Down Easy,"
and a party atmosphere prevails on his "Dead Presidents" ("I ain't broke,
but I'm badly bent, everybody loves them dead presidents").</p>

<p>Dixon's blues tend to be upbeat, party blues, kick-your-butt kind of
music. Blues bravado is apparent in blues classics like "Hoochie Coochie Man,"
"Seventh Son" and "I'm Ready" ("I'm drinkin' TNT, I'm smokin' dynamite,
I hope some screwball starts a fight, 'cuz I'm ready").

<p>The material here often pushes the border between blues and rock'n'roll.
Bo Diddley's enthusiastic "You Can't Judge a Book By Its Cover" nearly
dances its way through the air.</p>

<p>Down-home earthy blues are here as well, from the bad-luck lyrics of
"Third Degree," to the rolling melody
of "Walkin' the Blues" to the punctuated rhythm of the Howlin' Wolf
classic "I Ain't Superstitious."</p>

<p>Dixon impressed many musicians, including rockers such as The Doors (who
covered the "Back Door Man" represented here), The Rolling Stones ("Little
Red Rooster") and Cream ("Spoonful").
Led Zeppelin borrowed heavily from Dixon's material: "You Need Love" became
"Whole Lotta Love," while "You Shook Me," "Bring It On Home" and "I Can't
Quit You Baby" were covers. Dixon eventually sued for royalties -- right
after his friends Page and Plant sold their interest in the Zep songs.</p>

<p>If you can't afford to buy the entire Chess catalog, the Dixon box
is the next best thing. Highly recommended.</p>

White Zombie</h1>

<p>On February 13, 1996, the Pensacola, Florida Civic Center was
temporarily transformed into a throbbing, neopagan audiovisual orgy of
devilworshipping nose-pierced teenagers. The occasion for the
festival was the arrival of psychedelic metal band White Zombie.</p>

<h2>Inauspicious Arrival</h2>

<p>It started unpromisingly enough, with a mediocre, distortion-heavy
nonperformance by Filter, some band that has a couple of songs on the
radio. That was just to clear the palate -- fresh Zombie was on
the way.</p>

<p>In the intermission between the Filter and Zombie sets, about half of
the audience in the stands decided to rush the floor.
In the interest of fair reporting, I joined them. It seemed too
easy, and it was. The management sent security guards to scour the floor
sending anyone without a hand stamp back to the seats. They got a lot
of people, but not everyone. Heh heh. The secret is to keep moving and
never make eye contact.</p>

<P>By the time the lights dimmed for White Zombie's show, the floor
was really riled up. The seat crowd was pretty tame the whole show,
but the floor was electric the whole night long. And only a couple of
people got hurt.</p>

<h2>Devil Music</h2>

<p>The devilworshipping theme in rock music goes quite a ways back.
Religion was one of the first opponents of rock'n'roll, so it was only
natural that rock would retaliate. Besides, rock is a rebellion
against organized anything, and at its essence is a way for teenagers to
piss off their elders. Whatever shocks works.</p>

<p>Black Sabbath -- named after an old B-movie horror flick -- probably
started it all, bringing in Aleister Crowley overtones and long, drawn out
guitar fuzz. Ozzy perhaps was the peak of this genre when he bit the
head off a bat and otherwise killed little furry creatures on stage.</p>

<p>In the 1980's, various heavy metal bands took the theme to cinematic
proportions. Dressed in leather and chains, and wearing almost as much
makeup as Tammy Faye Baker, Motley Crue and their ilk shouted at the
devil whenever they got the chance. Speed and death metal bands probably
took this as far as it could go.</p>

<p>In the 1990's, White Zombie -- named after an old B-movie horror
flick -- revived the tradition on a grand scale. Abandoning pure metal
for a gumbo of psychedelic, funk, house and other influences, Zombie
thrives on the devilworshipper image. Their first album, <cite>Sexorcisto:
Devil Music Volume One</cite>, set the tone. Their stage act, replete
with skeletons, fire, dead bodies, and the like, completes the picture.</p>

<h2>Teensomething</h2>

<p>Zombie's audience was definitely the too-young-to-drink crowd. Flannel,
pierced noses and floppy hairdos were the uniform of choice. The floor
was a writhing mass of jumping, headbanging and moshing. When at
various times throughout the show, Zombie's lead singer (Mr. Zombie)
yelled "Jump!  Jump! Jump!" the floor was only happy to oblige, with hordes
of teenagers bouncing up and down like a pogo stick convention. (I'm
getting too old for this shit. My legs still hurt.)</p>

<p>About halfway through the performance, the singer tried to get the
stands to rush the floor again, but no one did. Wimps. Oh well, the
floor was happy.</p>

<h2>Seeing is Believing</h2>

<p>The most intense part of the show was the tight connection between
the music and the giant projection screen behind the band. Despite
the headbanging, mock satanist approach, the show was intelligent,
with subtle interplay between onscreen images and the blizzard
of sound.</p>

<p>Zombie started with some of their best songs from the first album,
"Psychoholic Slag" and "Black Sunshine." "Sunshine" ripped through
the air as the video screen played images of indy car race wrecks.
Cars sped by, spun out, and slammed into walls as Zombie's incredible
bassist (female by the way) laid down the steady rolling bass line.</p>

<p>The video screen melted through series of unconnected images --
Charles Manson's arrest for one song, sci-fi porn anime for
another, horror B-movie scenes for another.</p>

<p>At one point, the screen showed a short video clip
of a news broadcast (unaccompanied by music) giving a sensational
warning of an upcoming Zombie concert. The television "personality"
interviewed a local pastor and mouthed almost-sincere-sounding platitudes
about teens not being able to differentiate between stage acts and
reality.</P>

<p>As the clip ended, a bunch of sparklers floated down above the band,
rotating around and showering sparks as circus organ music played
laughingly in the background. Then, in the most spectacular part of the show,
four brightly dressed crucified clowns dropped from the ceiling,
hanging in midair as the band launched into a little more devil music.</p>

<p>The band played for nearly two hours, spanning their best songs from
their two recent albums (1992's <cite>Sexorcisto</cite> and 1995's
<cite>Astro Creep 2000</cite>). "Thunder Kiss '65," the Beavis-and-Butthead
hit that may have started it all, rocked, as did the more
recent "Super Charger Heaven" and "Electric Head."</P>

<p>The teenage years may not last very long, but they sure are fun to
watch.</p>

<p><cite>Yeah I want it ... yeah I need it ... yeah I love it ... electric
head in your head in your head ...</cite></p>

Presidents of the United States of America</h1>

<p>With an aircraft carrier parked outside, the Presidents of the
United States of America played a whole lot of music at the Pensacola
Bayfront Auditorium, May 11, 1996. In case you don't know, the Presidents
are the three-man, five-string band that made it big with "Lump" (now
Weird Al's "Gump").</p>

<p>At first, I thought I had made a mistake and entered the theater
for the Muppet Show. The average age must have been around thirteen,
and I swear there were some eight year olds walking around. Those
darn kids! All the old folks (twentysomethings) were hanging around
the beer corral, where they quickly ran out of Budweiser. Zima or
Bud Lite? Aaaaaaaaa!</p>

<h2>We're From Seattle</h2>

<blockquote>
'cuz there's a million better bands<br>
with a million better songs<br>
</blockquote>

<p>PUSA is from Seattle, and I guess they thought it would be cool
to give some other Seattle bands a chance. Their two opening acts
were both Seattle bands. They both sucked. One had one decent song,
"Beer Money," and the rest was pretty sloppy and uninspired.</p>

<p>The audience was cool most of the time, high-energy of course.
Lots of body surfing, three or four people at any given time. The
temperature was about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and everyone was
jumping and slamming and so forth, so everyone was drenched in sweat.</p>

<p>There were a few annoyances: someone threw a bolt at the guitarist,
causing him to stop the show and bitch for a minute, and some
dudes who looked more appropriate to a Skynyrd concert started moshing
with the primary goal of hurting people. An unusual number of people
had to be carted out of the place, one woman apparently falling from
the balcony, and several others that looked like they were suffering
from heat stroke or something.</p>

<h2>This is a Song About ...</h2>

<p>PUSA's lead singer has a habit of starting off every song by
saying, "This is a song about ...". They played their entire current
album except for two songs ("Body" and "Candy"), plus a good wallop
of new songs and covers.</p>

<p>They led off with their awesome rendition of "Kick Out The Jams,"
then jumped into their bug trilogy consisting of "Boll Weevil," "Bug City"
("this is a song about a stay-out-all-night-and-party bug") and
"Dune Buggy."</p>

<p>They do some great covers, putting a raw edge on classics like
"Video Killed the Radio Star" ("this is a song about how video killed
the radio star"). It's obvious that they love music and love playing
music. They're also very technically proficient, despite limiting
themselves to three-string guitar and two-string bass.</p>

<p>They suprised me and did all their hits in the first portion of
their show -- "Lump," "Kitty" and "Peaches" ("this is a song about something
you have in your kitchen"). Didn't save anything for the encore, which
is kind of cool for a change.</p>

<p>The encore was more like a second set. They must have played another
ten songs. PUSA definitely rocks -- if you like the CD, you'll like the
concert.</p>

Ozzy Osbourne</h1>

<p>Ozzy Osbourne, the original Master of Reality, unable to leave the
world of performing, ended a three-year leave of absence from touring
to promote his eleventh solo album, 1996's <cite>Ozzmosis</cite>. The Oz-man
hit the Pensacola Civic Center on May 20.</p>

<p>The first opening act was Sepultura (Portuguese for "one who resembles
the Addams Family's Cousin It"). Sepultura's thrash-core
(possibly unintentional) parody of heavy metal started things off with
a bang, laying a heavy undercurrent to the evening. The second band,
Type O Negative, was from Brooklyn, which is probably why they sucked.</p>

<br clear=all>
<h2>Rock's Court Jester</h2>

<blockquote>
You know all that stuff about being clean and sober? It's fucking bullshit.
I lied.
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the evening, Ozzy made it clear that he is more interested
in performing than in singing. Songs were almost incidental to his having
fun running across the stage, interacting with the crowd and throwing
buckets of water everywhere. Large video screens added playful imagery to
the blistering guitar licks and searing vocals.</p>

<p>Before the band came on stage, the screens played a fifteen-minute
video of Ozzy parodying pop culture. Everything from Elvis to Madonna fell
into his realm. You really had to be there -- words can't adequately describe
the hilarity of Bill Clinton giving a speech while a superimposed image
of Ozzy throws stuff on the President's desk and lights up a joint
next to him. Or Ozzy as the fifth Beatle singing "Twist and Shout."</p> 

<p>The band started off with a kicking version of "Paranoid" and proceeded
to jam for two hours to all the standards from "Flying High Again" and
"Bark at the Moon" to "No More Tears" and "Road to Nowhere", as well as
newer hits like "Perry Mason." All the while he was prancing around,
shooting the audience with a huge water gun, mooning the crowd and
repeatedly asking everyone to "show me your fookin' hands."</p>

<p>Ozzy left the stage for a short while as the other band members
played an extended solo. The guitarist's white-hot licks kept up the
headbanging mood as the bassist and drummer laid down the train-rolling
beat.</p>

<p>Ozzy came back to do a Sabbath tribute with "Iron Man", "Sweetleaf"
and a few other oldies but goodies. Several encores wrapped up the show,
starting with "Mama I'm Coming Home" and culminating in "Crazy Train,"
leaving the aging headbanger crowd pumped up but satisfied.</p>

<h2>Aging Rocker Poster Child</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Don't you try to teach me no original sin<br>
I don't need your pity for the shape I'm in<br>
<p>I don't want to change the world<br>
I don't want the world to change me<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Ozzy Osbourne, the man who spent his youth chasing immortality and
courting darkness, preaching and living excess, has ended up with
as a pot-bellied, middle-aged old fart who can't hit
the high notes any more. "Satan laughing spreads his wings."</p> 

<p>Ozzy was drinking shots all night long, and as the evening wore
on he stumbled more and more weaving across the stage. Occasionally he
would miss a lyric or start a line late. At one point near the end, as
he tried to get the audience to start clapping, he clapped off beat.</p>

<p>His hoarse voice cracked often, reducing to a whisper when high
notes extended beyond his current range. I got the impression that
when he encouraged the audience to sing along, it wasn't so much for
the spirit as to avoid having to sing a few more lines.</p>

<h2>The Performer</h2>

<p>Ozzy, born in 1948, put out eight albums with Black Sabbath and
another eleven (so far) solo. 1992's "No More Tours" tour was supposedly
his last one, but after three years of staying home with the wife and kid,
Ozzy got back on the road again with his "Retirement Sucks" tour.</p>

<p>Ozzy is a performer at heart, never truly himself unless he's on
stage. He will never stop recording and touring. I get a picture of
Ozzy, ten or fifteen years from now, slowly turning into Archie Bunker,
balding, grey-haired and sitting in a big EZ-recliner chair on stage
with a beer in his hand. "Come on, show me your fookin' hands ...
everyone get fookin' crazy."</p>

<blockquote>
Because I'm in such a good mood, I'm going to play
<em>one more song</em> ...
</blockquote>

<title>My Debian System</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1><a href="index.html">Debian</a></h1>
<h2>The system on which I installed Debian</h2>

<p>I installed Debian 0.93R5 on my home computer. With Linux, just about
every component matters. You've got to make sure there is support for it
(see the Hardware HOWTO for details).</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD 486DX2/66 CPU
<li>20MB RAM (originally 8MB)
<li>515MB Western Digital hard disk
<li>3.5" floppy drive
<li>no-name Cirrus Logic 5428 video card
<li>Microcom V.34 28.8Kbps internal modem
<li>Conner TapeStor 250 QIC-80 tape drive
<li>Peak Performance 2-button mouse
<li>MAG Innovision 15" SVGA monitor
<li>Canon BJ-100 BubbleJet printer
<li>original OS: MS-DOS 6.22, Windows for Workgroups 3.11
</ul>

<p>I have a dialup PPP connection to the net.</p>

<p>Just a few examples of why components matter in a Linux install. The hard
disk gave me problems because it has more than 1024 cylinders. The video
card and monitor together determine how to configure X windows. The fax modem
is class 1, and requires class-1 compatible fax software. To use the printer I
needed an appropriate driver for GhostScript and had to configure lpr
appropriately. I strongly advise anyone considering a Linux install to do
a complete inventory of their system components!</p>

<title>Debian Disks</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1><a href="index.html">Debian</a></h1>
<h2>Getting the Debian Disks</h2>

<p>To install Debian from floppy you need five disks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot floppy: this boots Debian.
<li>Root floppy: this contains just enough of a system to run; bootdisk uses
this to run Debian so you can install Debian on your hard disk.
<li>3 base floppies: these contain the "base" package, the minimal Debian
system. Once installed on your hard disk, you don't need floppies anymore
(kind of).
</ul>

<p>"Images" of the above disks are available from ftp.debian.org
(and mirrors) under <a
href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/stable/disks">/debian/stable/disks</a>.
The disk images are available for both 5.25" and 3.5" floppies
(1200* and 1440* respectively).</p>

<p>You can copy these images to disk using "dd" from Unix or "rawrite" from
DOS/Windows. Since I started with a Windows system, I downloaded rawrite, also
available from Debian archives under <a
href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/tools/">/debian/tools/</a>.
I used rawrite to copy the images to five floppies.</p>

<p>There is also a CD-ROM available now from the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian Organization</a>.</p>

<title>Repartitioning for Debian</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1><a href="index.html">Debian</a></h1>
<h2>Repartitioning for Debian</h2>

<p>I have a 515MB hard disk that I wanted to hold both Windows and Debian.
Originally there was one partition (for Windows' C: drive) spanning the entire
disk. I wanted three partitions: 195MB DOS, 303MB Linux root partition and 17MB
Linux swap partition (strange numbers because of cylinder boundaries).</p>

<p>Step One in messing with your hard disk is backing up the entire thing. To
this end, I purchased a Conner TapeStor 250 QIC minicartridge tape drive. (Good
price from <A HREF="http://cexpress.com:2700/">Computer Express!</a>, much
better ones are even cheaper now.) I installed the drive and backed up C:.</p>

<p>Step Two in messing with your hard disk is to create a system floppy to boot
DOS. (When C: is gone, you won't be able to run anything that happened to be on
it.) So I created a system floppy (FORMAT /S A:) and copied FDISK.EXE and
FORMAT.COM from C:\DOS to the system floppy.</p>

<p>Next what is <em>supposed</em> to happen is that you boot with the system
floppy, use FDISK to delete existing partitions and create a new
(smaller) DOS partition. Then you FORMAT /S C:, restore from backup and move
on.</p>

<p>However, I had <a href="problem.html">problems</a> because my hard drive
has more than 1024 cylinders. In my case, the backup was the only useful thing
accomplished at this point. I had to create the DOS partition from Debian
and restore the C: drive later.</p>

<title>Booting Debian</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1><a href="index.html">Debian</a></h1>
<h2>Booting Debian and Installing Base</h2>

<p>Well now I have my bootdisk, rootdisk and three basedisks. My hard drive is
backed up and repartitioned to make room for Debian. The next step was to boot
Debian and install the base system.</p>

<p>Booting is easy. Stick the bootdisk in the drive and reboot. The bootdisk
ran fine, but gave one strange message: "No BIOS32 extensions present. This
release still depends on it. Sorry." I later found out from Michael Neuffer
that this only applies to a EATA/PCI/SCSI combination and can be safely ignored
in other configurations.</p>

<p>After the bootdisk is done, it asks for the rootdisk. The rootdisk put
me in cfdisk ("curses fdisk"), a nice screen-oriented program for installing
Debian (actually for messing with your hard disk).</p>

<p>Cfdisk presents a menu of nine steps that you must go through one
by one (except "show partition table" which you can do at any time). I don't
remember the exact wording or sequence, but it roughly followed this
outline.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change disk partitions. I had <a href="problem.html">problems</a> here
because I have a hard disk with greater than 1024 cylinders.
cfdisk wouldn't read my partition table correctly. What I wound up doing was
deleting existing partitions, then creating three partitions: 195MB for
DOS, 303MB for Linux root and 17MB for Linux swap.</p>

<p>I later booted DOS with a DOS boot disk, formatted the DOS partition and
restored my DOS C: drive to it.</p>

<p>Linux requires at least one partition for the root file system. A swap
partition is highly recommended. If you like, you can create other partitions
for other file systems such as /usr, /var and /home.</p>

<li><p>Activate swap. If you created a swap partition, this makes it used.</p>

<li><p>Install Debian base system. Put in the three basedisks
when asked, and Debian is on your hard drive.</p>

<li><p>Create bootdisk. This allows you to create a new boot floppy so that you
can boot from the root file system on your hard disk rather than needing a
separate rootdisk floppy.</p>

<li><p>Display partition table. Do this at any time to see what
partitions are on your hard disk.</p>

<li><p>Reboot system. Reboots don't work on my box; reboot flashes some
keyscan errors on my screen then hangs. Although the 1.2.9 kernel claimed
to fix the hang-on-reboot problem, it persisted on my machine even after
upgrading to 1.2.13.</p>

<li><p>Go to shell. Now you can actually use the system you just installed. In
reality, this is just to see that things are working. You'll want to boot from
your new bootdisk, and login at the prompt.</p>

</ol>

<title>Networking Debian</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1><a href="index.html">Debian</a></h1>
<h2>Networking Debian</h2>

<p>By this point I was happy. I had the Debian base package installed on my
hard drive and I had a boot floppy to boot it. The next thing to do was to get
the packages that make the system usable: X windows, printer support,
development kits and so forth.</p>

<p>The problem is that while all the Debian packages are available on the
Internet, the base package doesn't include network support. If you want to
install from the net, you need to get the net packages first.</p>

<p>How I did this was to run Windows, download some basic packages (including
networking) to a single floppy, then boot Debian back up, copy the files from
floppy to the Debian filesystem, and install the packages.</p>

<h2>"Packages" in Debian</h2>

<p>Debian's nicest feature is "packages." Installation and maintenance of
software is simplified by having "package" files containing all the binaries,
configuration files etc. needed by an application. The "dselect" program
(along with the command-line "dpkg" that is uses) lets you install, configure
and remove all packages.</p>

<p>For example, the "lilo" package contains LILO, the Linux loader which allows
you to boot Linux (and other operating systems such as DOS/Windows) from your
hard disk. The lilo package file is "lilo-15-4.deb" which shows the package
name ("lilo"), the developer's release ("15"), and the Debian package release
("4").<p>

<p>Packages are stored on Debian archive sites in the "binary" directory. The
packages are organized into "sections" corresponding to archive directories.
For example, the "lilo" package is in the "system" directory (section).</p>

<h2>Choosing Minimal Packages</h2>

<p>I didn't want to keep switching back and forth from Windows to Debian, so I
wanted to download enough packages to let me work within Debian. At the same
time, I wanted to keep it down to one floppy if possible.</p>

<p>My choice of initial packages was:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>base/dpkg. You don't need to re-install any of the base software, but I
wanted to be sure I had a recent version of dpkg.</p>

<li><p>editors/elv-vi. Elvis is a vi clone (I'm an unreformed vi user).
The Debian base system now comes with ee, the "easy editor", but when
I installed it you had to add your own editor.</p>

<li><p>system/lilo. LILO lets you boot Linux from your hard disk so you don't
need a boot floppy. Major convenience.</p>

<li><p>net/netbase. The base Internet package for connecting to the net.</p>

<li><p>net/netstd. The standard Internet applications.</p>

<li><p>net/ppp. I have a PPP Internet account, so I needed the ppp package to
dial up.</p>

</ul>

<p>The above packages fit on one floppy with room to spare. Note that it was a
DOS floppy because I had to download them from Windows.</p>

<h2>Installing Packages from Floppy</h2>

<p>Installing from a DOS floppy involved:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot Linux with Linux boot disk and login as root.
<li>Create directory to hold packages (e.g. /usr/local/packages).
<li>Mount DOS floppy: <samp>mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /floppy</samp>
<li>Copy files from floppy to package directory:
<samp>cp /floppy/* /usr/local/packages</samp>.
<li>I renamed the files to their original names, although I didn't have to.
<li>Unmount DOS floppy: <samp>unmount /dev/fd0</samp>.
<li>Install each package with "dpkg."
</ol>

<p>I learned "dpkg" by trial-and-error, which wasn't too hard since it is
incredibly easy to use. For each package, I ran "dpkg --install
&lt;filename&gt;" which did everything. All I had to do was watch. You can also
run "dpkg --install --auto &lt;directory-name&gt;" which installs all ".deb"
files in the specified directory, but I wanted to follow things a little more
closely. Debian now comes with "dselect," a screen-oriented front-end to
dpkg.</p>

<p>After dpkg did its work, I <a href="ppp.html">configured PPP</a> and
connected to my Internet account. At this point I could download other
packages with FTP and work entirely within Linux.</p>

<title>Installing Debian Packages</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1><a href="index.html">Debian</a></h1>
<h2>Installing Debian Packages</h2>

<p>Once I had LILO set up to boot Linux, and PPP configured so I could connect
to the Internet, I then set out to download and install more Debian
packages.</p>

<p>This was easier than installing the first (networking) packages, because
I could do everything from within Linux without needing floppies.</p>

<p>The process is simple: ftp to <a
href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/stable/binary/">ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/stable/binary/</a>,
get the package files you want, and run "dselect". When I installed,
dselect wasn't available, so I did "dpkg --install" on each one instead.</p>

<h2>Some Good Packages</h2>

<p>Some things come in handy early on. I would recommend getting the following
first.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>system/lilo. LILO lets you boot Linux from hard disk.</p>
<li><p>Your favorite editor. Mine is vi, so I downloaded editors/elvis, a vi
clone.</p>
<li><p>net/netbase, net/netstd and net/ppp. If you have a dial-up Internet
connection you need these.</p>
<li><p>text/groff, text/man. Lets you read manual pages.</p>
<li><p>admin/cron, devel/m4, devel/make. Some other useful things depend on
these.</p>
<li><p>x11/xbase, xbaseR6, xr5shlib, xfnt100, xfnt75, and an X server.
My video card uses the xsvga server package.</p>
</ul>

<p>After that, you can use your system comfortably while you get other stuff.
Developers will want most of the things under devel. Everyone will probably
want some more stuff from editors, tex and text for printing and text editing.
Mail, news and net contain Internet apps.</p>

<p>Some of the packages I installed include <a href="ftape.html">ftape</a>
and <a href="lpr.html">lpr</a>.</p>

<h2>Installing Non-Debian Software</h2>

<p>After I had a nice Debian system up and running, I wanted to add software
that isn't "packaged" for Debian. That is, I needed to download and compile some
freely available packages.</p>

<p>Among the software I installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="apache.html">Apache</a>: HTTP server (since then,
	Apache has been Debian-packaged)</li>
<li><a href="pcsnd.html">pcsndrv</a>: Linux PC speaker driver</li>
<li>xv: image tool (now packaged and distributed in the "non-free" section
	because it is shareware)</li>
<li>Netscape: I think you've heard of this one (a package is now available
	that assumes you have downloaded Netscape, and installs it
	properly for you)</li>
</ul>

<title>Party Cancun</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Party Cancun</h1>

<p>Cancun is one of the few places on Earth designed from the ground
up as a party town. If you like drinking and dancing, and have a ton
of money to blow, do it. Especially if you aren't sure about traveling
in a foreign country, Cancun is about as delicate a transition as you
can get from the U.S. without going to some boring cold place like Canada.</p>

<h2>Spirit</h2>

<p>Cancun displays a spiritual affinity with New Orleans,
only an hour or two away by plane.
The most obvious sign is the presence of N'awlins mainstays
like Pat O'Brien's, Fat Tuesday and Ruth's Chris Steak House.
Se&ntilde;or Frog's and of course Hard Rock Caf&eacute;
are in both towns.</p>

<p>One major difference is the music. Unlike New Orleans, Cancun is
very limited musically. Mexicans still haven't discovered the electric
guitar, and that syncopated upbeat gets annoying after a while. Great
stuff to dance to, though.</p>

<p>Most locals speak English, so you can get by, but Spanish is
definitely preferred.</p>

<p>All the hotels and clubs are on the strip of the island, known as
the Hotel Zone (<i>Zonas Hoteleras</i>). There is just one road, which
is great for drunks trying to figure out which way to go.</p>

<h2>What You Need To Know in Cancun (Abridged Version)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Bacardi is the cheap stuff in Mexico. Pick up
a few bottles of Cuervo, Kahlua and Bacardi cheap to take back home, and
try not to drink them before then. Well, maybe just <em>one</em>.</p>

<li><p>Mexicans are shy, until they get on the dance floor.</p>

<li><p>Never haggle unless you're sober. Imagine if car dealers could
switch between two currencies.</p>

<li><p>Most clubs are open all night long all week long, but weekends
are hottest, and Dady O's is the place to be after 2am or so.</p>

<li><p>Tequila slammers and Dos Equis beer (<i>cervesa</i>) should form
a large part of your diet.</p>

<li><p>The clubs and street musicians play the same ten songs over and
over again, three of which are "La Bamba." (Believe it or not, one of
the others is "Old MacDonald Had a Farm.")</p>

<li><p>Always take the bus (three pesos), unless you are too drunk to
remember where your hotel is, in which case take a taxi (agree on the
fare ahead of time).</p>

<li><p>Do drink the water. The hotels and shopping centers (<i>plazas</i>)
on the island have purified water. Off the island, don't take the chance.</p>

<li><p>If you're looking for the authentic Mexican experience, you're
in the wrong place. A day trip to downtown or Isla des Mujeres will
help satisfy your desire for foreign stimulation.</p>

<li><P>Snorkeling is cool.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Spanish for Partiers</h2>

<p>You don't <em>need</em> to know Spanish to party in Cancun, but
even a little helps. So few U.S. partiers even bother with <i>si</i>
or <i>gracias</i> that the locals recognize when someone respects the
place enough to try.</p>

<p>Luckily for drunks, Spanish follows simple rules, unlike English.
The same letters are always pronounced the same. Quick refresher: in Spanish,

J is pronounced like the English H (think <i>jalape&ntildeo</i>).

H is silent.

E is pronounced kind of like the A in SAY, even at the end of a word.

O is like the O in FOR.

L is L, but LL is Y (think <i>tortilla</i>).</p>

<p>Little bits of Spanish come in handy even when you speak mostly English:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><i>Si.</i> Yes. Don't say this if you don't understand the
question.</p>

<li><p><i>No.</i> No. Tough, ain't it?</p>

<li><p><i>Gracias.</i> Thanks. Say this about once every sentence.</p>

<li><p><i>Arrete.</i> Stop the bus. (You could push the button instead, but
this is more fun. Also <i>bajon</i> to open the back door.)</p>

<li><p><i>Uno dos tres quatro cinco seis siete ocho nueve diez.</i> You should
remember these from Sesame Street.</p>

<li><p><i>Ron.</i> Rum, as in <i>ron y coke</i>. With a lime,
<i>cuba libre</i>.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Etc.</h2>

<p>Whatever your style of partying, it's there and it isn't hard to find.
Enjoy.</p>

<p>The beaches, of course, are beautiful. Cancun is at the beginning of
the Caribbean. The water really is crystal clear and blue as the sky.
Reefs for snorkeling are plentiful with brilliantly colored fish.
Half-day or full-day tours to take you there are available all
over the place.<p>

<h2>Smuggling</h2>

<p>Leaving the U.S. is pretty easy. Have your birth certificate and driver's
license, and fill out a tourist card when you arrive. Entering Mexico
is <i>no problemo</i> -- even if you get the red light they just open
your bags and look without poking around.</p>

<P>Re-entering the U.S. isn't much more difficult if you look like a
tourist. You fill out a customs form listing what you have (you can bring
in $400 worth of stuff including one liter of alchohol with no duties).
Cuban cigars are strictly forbidden in the U.S., so hide them in your
luggage along with your other three bottles of liquor.</p>

<title>Bars of Pensacola</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Bars of Pensacola</h1>

<p>Pensacola, Florida is best known for its white sand beaches.
Some of the most beautiful beaches in the world stretch along the
Florida panhandle, which starts at Pensacola and continues down
through Ft. Walton Beach and Destin to Panama City.</p>

<p>If you're ever in the area, and you should be, you might want
to check out some of the nightlife in the Pensacola area.</p>

<hr><h2>Seville Quarter</h2>

<p>The granddaddy of Pensacola partying, Seville is the place to
hang out. Seville is a collection of seven small bars housed in a
historic building in downtown Pensacola (built in the 1880's).
You pay one cover charge and stroll around through all the bars,
each of which has its own ambience. Or, if you're a real lush, you
become a member for $25 and get in free year-round.</p>

<p>Lili Marlene's is a tiny bar with dart boards and a stage where
Rick Holt and Blues for Your Mama can often be found playing. Good
for playing darts of course, and for drinking in small groups.</p>

<p>Fast Eddie's is the sports bar of the place, with pool tables,
a few TV sets and -- gotta be hip -- an Internet surfing station.
When they had air hockey here it was cool, now it sucks. The last
thing I want to do when I go out is look at a computer.</P>

<p>The Palace Oyster Bar and Restaurant, as its name implies, is
where you can sit down for a meal. You can order food anywhere though --
the Oysters Seville is a house specialty.</p>

<p>Phineas Phogg's is the dance club. Great place to wind up after
you've been drinking everywhere else. It also has a nice balcony
from which you can discreetly observe everyone dancing.</p>

<p>The End O'the Alley Bar is small, even by Seville standards, but
has the best beer selection (but no Dos Equis, damn). In the courtyard,
you can breathe the fresh air (or a cigar) while listening to a mediocre
reggae band.</p>

<p>Seville usually gets going around 10pm or so and lasts late.
Fridays and Saturdays are busiest of course, but even most weekdays
have some action. Wednesday evenings are business hour -- bring a
business card and get a free drink. Tuesdays and Thursdays 18-year-olds
can get in, otherwise 21-and-up only.</p>

<hr><h2>The Dock</h2>

<p>Chances are, if you're in Pensacola, you're going to the beach.
What do you do when you get there? Go to The Dock if you want to party.</p>

<p>Located in the heart of Pensacola Beach on Santa Rosa Island, directly
on the Gulf of Mexico, the Dock is the ultimate beach hangout. Enjoy
a view of the Gulf as you sip a frozen drink and listen to island music.</p>

<p>Sundays are rum-and-reggae days -- specials on rum drinks and
the best damn reggae band I've ever heard, Lazy Day. Lazy Day is the only
band I've heard that can do a good Marley cover. Their brand of reggae
includes island versions of old standbys such as "Brown Eyed Girl"
and rockin' versions of dance music. Guaranteed to get you on the
dance floor.</p>

<p>The Dock has a couple of pool tables, serves some decent fried
shrimp and oyster baskets, and employs some of the best looking waitresses
in Pensacola. One of the best ways to renew your appreciation of life
is to spend a Sunday at Pensacola Beach, hanging out on the beach til
evening, then heading to the Dock for dinner, a few games of pool,
more than a few Cuba Libres, and some kick-ass music.</p>

<hr><h2>Chan's and Coconut Bay</h2>

<p>These two are within walking distance so I'll lump them together.
Located in the northern area of Pensacola, these are close to the
malls and the University of West Florida. Kinda the college kid hangout.</p>

<p>Chan's has a volleyball court, dart boards and TV sets, and is also
a decent restaurant. They've started calling Tuesdays cigar nights, but
their cigar selection sucks and no one goes there to smoke.</p>

<p>Coconut Bay is probably the best dance club in Pensacola, which
is like saying the best Mexican restaurant in Idaho (not very difficult).
Nice mix of bar, dance floor and outdoor veranda.</p>

<hr><h2>The Cigar Brewery</h2>

<p>Oh yeah! It's about time. Pensacola finally has a cigar bar.
Unfortunately, it's kind of slow right now, but I expect that it'll
pick up soon with Spring Break right around the corner.</p>

<p>The Cigar Brewery on Zaragossa Street downtown is a laid back
cigar bar with a walk-in humidor and mac daddy beer on tap (Bass,
Samuel Adams, etc.). Jazz music plays lightly in the background.
The air filtration system is working better now, so you no longer
have to smoke more of everyone else's cigars than your own.</p>

<p>The humidor has a decent selection at decent prices (for cigars
these days). None of my favorites, but you can always get a Thomas
Hinds.</p>

<hr><h2>Bedlam's</h2>

<p>Pensacola's "rave" bar, also downtown, opens at 2am and closes
whenever. You bring your own beer, and pay to bring it in the door
(two bucks a six pack or something like that). Bedlam's is the whole
rave scene, so there are druggies and gays there. On the other hand,
drugged out lesbians can be fun to dance with.</p>

<title>Nevada's Prostitution</title>
<!-- Place: Nevada (USA) -->
<!-- Time: current -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Legal Prostitution in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nv/">Nevada</a></h1>

<p>Prostitution is not illegal everywhere. In particular, in the United
States, prostitution is legal in certain counties of Nevada.</p>

<p>State law forbids counties with high populations from legalizing
brothels, so prostitution is illegal in Las Vegas,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nv/Reno.html">Reno</a>,
Carson City and
Lake Tahoe. Other counties may license brothels; street solicitation is
illegal.</p>

<p>Prostitutes are required to use condoms for all types of intercourse,
and must undergo regular medical checkups. The rate of AIDS infection is
nearly zero. Where prostitution is illegal, AIDS rates are often over
25 percent.</p>

<title>Handicapped Nude Dancers</title>

<h1>Antidiscrimination Law Shuts Down Nude Dancers</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> city
officials shut down an adult nightclub's main feature,

claims the club discriminates against the handicapped, denying them an
equal opportunity to work as nude dancers, according to Reuters news
service.</p>

<p>Patrons of the Odd Ball Cabaret could previously pay $20 to watch a nude
dancer take a shower for five minutes.</p>

<p>More than likely, the use of the antidiscrimination law was just an excuse
to stop a legal, but politically unpopular, form of expression.</p>

<title>The Jonestown Massacre</title>
<!-- Place: Jonestown (Guyana) -->
<!-- Time: mass suicide November 18, 1978 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Jonestown Massacre</h1>

<p>On November 18, 1978, over 900 members of a religious group led by
the Reverend Jim Jones were killed in an apparent mass suicide. The
megalomaniac Jones convinced most of his followers to drink a cyanide
mixture. Some, including Jones, were shot, either in suicide or murder.</p>

<p>Shortly before the mass suicide, U.S. Congressman Leo Ryan was assassinated
on Jones' orders. Ryan had just landed in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/SouthAmerica/Guyana/">Guyana</a> to investigate
alleged human rights abuses at Jonestown.</p>

<p>Jim Jones, born May 13, 1931 in Lynn, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/in/">Indiana</a>,
had his own religious
congregation, the People's Temple Full Gospel Church, in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/in/Indianapolis.html">Indianapolis</a>
by 1963. Jones led the interracial congregation (rare at the time) with
faith healing, visions and advice from extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>After spending a short time in Brazil, Jones moved his congregation to
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>. He
eventually moved it again to an isolated area of Guyana jungle,
naming the new settlement after himself.</p>

<p>Rumors abound of government connections to the Guyana tragedy.</p>

<p>A former Jones cult member, Phil Kerns, wrote a book claiming that
"Jones was a Marxist who had numerous contacts with officials of both the
Cuban and Soviet governments."</p>

<p>Others claim the CIA was involved in Jonestown, possibly as part of a
mind control experiment. The CIA definitely had operations in socialist
Guyana, and was certainly interested in cult members' Soviet embassy visits.
The CIA did have a mind control program, MK-ULTRA, the famous "LSD in your
coffee" experiments. One of Leo Ryan's congressional aides, among others,
suspects that the CIA did not disband the program in 1973, as it claims, but
instead continued the effort in religious cults like Jonestown.</p>

<p>In 1980, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence reported
"no evidence" of CIA involvement in Jonestown.</p>

<h1>The World Trade Center Bombing</h1>

<p>On February 26, 1993, a car bomb at the World Trade Center in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York
City</a>, <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a>
exploded, killing six people, injurning thousands and
causing extensive damage.</p>

<p>The FBI quickly arrested four radical Muslims, who were convicted in 1994.
More members of the radical group were tried beginning January 16, 1995
for a wide-ranging plot of terrorist attacks.</p>

<p>One reason the FBI was able to act so quickly is that an FBI informant was
the one who built the bomb. The informant, Emad Salem, was paid $1 million
for his testimony. Salem tape recorded conversations with the bombing
suspects. Unbeknownst to the FBI, Salem also recorded his conversations with
them.</p>

<p>The FBI benefited greatly from the World Trade Center bombing. In
particular, the bombing resulted in the proposal of the
<a href="/revolution/legal/police/terror95.html">1995
Counterterrorism Bill</a> greatly expanding federal authorities' budgets and
powers.</p>

<p>December 1993, from Terry Atwood (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a href="mailto:Terry.Atwood@f434.n109.z1.fidonet.org">
Terry.Atwood@f434.n109.z1.fidonet.org</a>):<p>

<p>"Tucked away on page A5 of the Washington <cite>Times</cite> for Wednesday,
December 15 is a tiny article about tape transcripts of a conversation
between the FBI informant, Emad Salem, and his controller, FBI agent
John Anticev.  As you may already know, Salem is a former Egyptian army
officer hired by the FBI to infiltrate (or organize?) a terrorist group
here in the U.S.  In April, two months after the bombing, when the taped
conversation took place, Anticev asked Selem to justify his expenses. Salem
defended his expense report by saying that his usual expenditures were pushed
up by the costs of building the trade center bomb.  He acknowleged procuring
the materials (at government expense) and personally building the bomb."</p>

<title>BATF's Motives at Waco</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>BATF Wanted to Make Example of Davidians</h1>

<p>The BATF wants to disarm American citizens. BATF particularly dislikes
Americans having access to the most powerful weapons, or large collections
of weapons. Even worse to the BATF is when Americans with unorthodox
religious or political views have large collections of the most powerful
weapons.</p>

<p>The problem, from the BATF's point of view, is that such a situation is
perfectly legal. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects
unorthodox religious and political views, and federal law imposes no limits
on the number of weapons that an individual can own.</p>

<p>The solution, from the BATF's point of view, is to use minor infractions
of the extensive federal firearms laws to justify draconian response.</p>

<p>In the case of the Branch Davidians, the BATF suspected legal, semiautomatic
rifles had been converted into unregistered, automatic rifles.</p>

<h2>Legitimate Concerns, Illegitimate Response</h2>

<p>The BATF had enough information to warrant legitimate concern about
illegal activities at Mt. Carmel. The most serious allegations were about
sexual abuse of 11 and 12 year old girls.</p>

<p>The BATF was still wrong in conducting a military attack of the
Davidians' residence.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Sexual abuse is not in the realm of the BATF, rather it is the realm
of state law. The information should have been passed to the proper authorities
for further investigation.</p>
<li><p>Allegations are just that. In the U.S., people accused of a crime are
considered innocent until proven guilty. Many of the allegations came from
dubious sources, such as "cult busters" intent on destroying the Davidians'
religion.</p>
<li><p>Investigating allegations does not justify a military assault.</p>
</ol>

<p>Other than the above charges, the allegations used to secure a search
warrant involved technical violations of gun control laws, and deprecating
innuendo about unorthodox (but peaceful) beliefs and habits.</p>

<h2>BATF Had Personal Grudge Against Koresh</h2>

<p>The affidavit used by the BATF to gain a search warrant made note of
the fact that David Koresh opposed gun control, believed U.S. gun control
laws were wrong, and possessed a Gun Owners' Association video portraying
the BATF as violating gun owners' rights by threats and lies.</p>

<title>Siege of the Branch Davidians</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 28 - April 19, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>The Siege</h1>

<p>After the U.S. government
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">attacked the
Branch Davidians</a> in Waco, Texas in February 1993, the FBI conducted
a fifty-one day siege of the religious group. The FBI clearly intended
nothing but a violent end, conducting the siege with bright lights
and loud noises played throughout the night, driving tanks up to
the compound, destroying cars parked outside, and so forth. More tanks
were sent to Waco than were sent to Somalia during the U.S. troops'
presence there.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="pressure.html">FBI agent pressured into recommending
	confrontational approach</a></li>
<li><a href="tapes.html">Transcript of negotitation tapes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Reported by Andrew Clark (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:clarka@netcom.com">clarka@netcom.com</a>):</p>

<p> The FBI deliberately precipitated a violent showdown by antagonising the
occupants of the commune via loudspeaker, refusing the assistance of family
members to plead with those inside, refusing to accept the assistance of
attorneys to persuade the occupants to surrender, and forcing the Branch
Davidians to act.</p>

<p> Sending in a combat engineering vehicle with a gas attachment is a good
start ... but such activity could easily start a fire. When LAPD was
experimenting with armored vehicle assaults into crack houses, they had
to figure out where the gas lines were and how to avoid them. Someone should
have assumed that Koresh would burn himself out, a reasonable conjecture
based on his "prophecies." Or, maybe the tank driver would fuck up and
hit a line?  It's called contingency planning.</p>

<p> Where the hell was the fire gear?  Over on misc.emerg-services, it
was reported that the FBI had to call 911 to get the Waco FD out
there. If the FBI knows it's going in, the fire apparatus should
have been set up and ready to go with plenty of reserve water (set
up storage tanks in advance and keep running refills if needed.) 
With all the aircraft the FBI seemed to have buzzing around, it
should have been easy to have a firefighting aircraft ready to 
drop water and/or fire retardant on the house.  If the Davidians
try to shoot at it with their (possibly mythical) .50 cal MGs,
then have your friendly neighborhood snipers put large holes in
their heads.  With all of the military shit the FBI had around,
they should have had lots and lots of snipers.</p>

<p> The timing in particular is difficult to understand. The argument that they
were concerned for the children is not credible, especially because the
FBI shut off the water. That was a dumb move; anything that weakens the
cultist's bodies also weakens their minds as well. Hungry, tired and
frightened people are remarkably easy to goad. </p>

<p> The FBI spokesman in Waco said tht they believed 'all of the adults have gas
masks.'  Shortly later he said that they hoped that the suffering of the
children (here I paraphrase) would motivate the BDs to release the children
due to their 'maternal insticts.' Any effect this might have had was surely
outweighed by the psychological effects of wearing a gas mask 
for any length of time.  This merely strengthened the siege mentality. </p>

<p> This is an admission that the attack was intended to deliberately inflict
suffering on the children, hoping to force the adults to act. Why would
anyone expect such a strategy to work on people who themselves were abusing
the children in question? Frankly, because FBI and BATF couldn't keep their
lies straight.</p>

<title>The Waco Fire</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 19, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Waco Fire</h1>

<p>On April 19, 1993, the U.S. government's
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">attack on the
Branch Davidians</a> at Waco, Texas came to an end with the deaths of
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/victims.html">86 men,
women and children</a>.</p>

<p>The official version, represented by investigator Paul Gray's report,
is that the Davidians committed suicide by setting the fire which
destroyed their home. This denies the volume of evidence otherwise:
tapes of negotiations showed the <a href="suicide.html">Davidians were
not suicidal</a>; FBI tanks killed women and children by collapsing
ceilings before the fire started; and the FBI itself may have started
the fire.</p>

<p>The feds had cut off electricity to Mt. Carmel and the Davidians were using
kerosene lamps, most hung on walls, for light. Then tanks start ramming
the building, collapsing walls. Then a fire starts. Much evidence exists
to show that the U.S. government intentionally started the fire,
trapped the occupants inside the burning building, and rigged the report
to mask their actions.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="cs_gas.html">Inflammable gas pumped into building</a></li>
<li><a href="coverup.html">Investigators covered up cause of fire</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Surviving Davidians' testimony, FBI agents' and Texas Rangers' testimony,
video evidence (including infrared video) and Mt. Carmel's design and
contents provide evidence of what happened on April 19.</p>

<p>According to the Justice Department report, fire started in three
separate locations in Mt. Carmel. Television footage shows that those
fires each started within two or three minutes of tanks ramming those
areas.</p>

<p>Why did the fire start? Tanks crushed through walls that held kerosene
lanterns into rooms containing butane heaters and propane tanks. At the same
time, the FBI pumped in highly inflammable CS gas (banned for use in war by
international treaty) into the building.</p>

<p>Why did the fire spread? The building contained inflammable liquids and
gases (kerosene, butane, propane and CS). Mt. Carmel was designed with many
long, narrow passageways, causing a "flue" effect spreading the fire. The FBI
dismissed fire fighters, who had been on standby during the entire siege, not
long before the fire. Winds that day were up to 30 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Why couldn't the Davidians escape? Government tanks demolished possible
exits, crushing people trapped in some rooms. The attack would have forced most
of them further into the building, making escape more difficult.</p>

<p>Why did the independent report not show this? Because it was a lie. The head
investigator, appointed by the feds, withheld some evidence and ignored others.
The feds prevented truly independent investigation by keeping press away from
the scene, bulldozing the site, then excavating the top several inches of
topsoil from the area. Even so, what evidence is available (video and
testimony) points to what can only be described as evil: the murder of innocent
Americans by their government.</p>

<title>Waco: The Coverup</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 1993 - June 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>The Waco Cover-Up</h1>

<p>April 1993: Claiming safety hazards from "millions of rounds of ammunition"
stored at the Davidian complex, reporters are kept 3 miles away from the scene.
However, on the day of the fire, ATF agents could be seen strolling
on the grounds near the fire, apparently unafraid of the "millions of rounds"
going off.</p>

<p> August 16, 1993: The Treasury Department places a proposed regulation in
the Federal Register (58FR43312) to allow the department to investigate the
Waco massacre without making the results of the investigation public as
required under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p> January 1994: During jury selection for the Davidians' trial, every attempt
is made to limit public access to the proceedings. As reported in
the January 11, 1994
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>
 <cite>Morning News</cite>, p. 10A:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">San
Antonio</a> resident, Francis Sommer, was arrested on a criminal
trespass charge after repeatedly demanding to be allowed into the courtroom
during jury selection.</p>

<p>An Associated Press reporter, Kelley Shannon, was escorted from the
courthouse without explanation, and a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Houston.html">Houston</a>
 <cite>Chronicle</cite> reporter was briefly denied entrance.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> AP bureau
chief John Lumpkin, in a letter to U.S. District 
Judge Harry Hudspeth, who presides over the Western District of Texas, said:
"Ms. Shannon did not deserve the treatment she received this morning.  From 
the beginning of this case, federal authorities have operated in such a manner
to inhibit the free flow of information."</p>

<p>Judge Smith barred all public spectators and allowed only a pool of
five reporters into the courtroom Monday, telling security officers that more
spectators might intimidate potential jurors, said an official with the U.S.
Marshals service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> June 1994: The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Committee and the Texas
Water Commission authorize a contractor to excavate 6" to 18" of topsoil from
the already burnt-over and bulldozed Mt. Carmel building site and surrounding 7
acres. The government claims the former grounds of the  Branch Davidian
community is contaminated with lead and human waste and is therefore a health
hazard.</p>

<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">attack on the
Branch Davidians</a> at Waco, Texas in 1993 stirred a
wave of antigovernment sentiment. Of course, the government's own reaction
has generally been continued persecution.</p>

<title>The Committee for Waco Justice</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: December 1993 - ongoing April 1995 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>The Committee for Waco Justice</h1>

<p>June 1995, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/CarolMoore.html">Carol
Moore</a>:</p>

<p>"The <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/CWJ.html">Committee for Waco Justice</a>
is working for an complete and thorough investigation of BATF and FBI crimes
against the Branch Davidian religious group near
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> and for
prosecution of responsible agents and officials.  We call for
freedom for the nine Branch Davidian prisoners sentenced to
243 years in prison for defending themselves against the
brutal BATF assault."</p>

<p>The CWJ has been active since at least December 1993, when Carol Moore
posted the following:</p>

<p>Our report on the massacre will demand:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>PROSECUTION OF ATF/FBI AGENTS:</p>

<p>At the end of the individual sections on ATF/FBI we will be
recommending prosecution of specific agents and officials under
the following two laws.</p>

<p>TITLE 18 SECTION 241-(18USC 241)-CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF
CITIZENS: If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten,
or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of
any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws
of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the
same; or if two or more persons go in disguise on the highway or
the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his
free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured- 
they shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more
than 10 years, or both: and if death results they shall be
subject to imprisonment for any term of years or for life.</p>

<p>TITLE 18 SECTION 242-(18USC242)-DEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS UNDER COLOR OF LAW:  
Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance,
regulation, or custom, willfully subject any inhabitant of any
state, territory or district to the deprivation of any rights,
privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the
Constitution or laws of the United States, or to different
punishments, pains, or penalties, on account of such inhabitant
being an alien, or by reasons of his color, or race, than are
prescribed for the punishment of citizens, shall be fined not
more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both;
and if death results shall be subject to imprisonment for any
term of years or for life.  </p>

<li><p>Abolish BATF</p>

<p>Or at least put it under the same restrictions FBI has on
accumulating information on Americans.  According to <cite>Washington
Times</cite> article 11/2/93 "ATF chief vows to keep an eye on religious
cults," John Magaw, acting director of BATF said, "We're trying
to monitor them early in the game ... find out their history, their
background, makeup."  Looks like all BATF has learned from Waco
is to spy better and use bigger guns!</p>

<li><p>Restrict FBI and Other Federal Agent Powers</p>

<p>Federal agents' ability to serve warrants should be restricted or eliminated.
Restrict local/state/federal "multi-taskforces" or joint actions against
individuals or groups making them all defacto "co-conspirators" and giving no
possibility of independent investigation of wrongdoing. (Especially, local and
state law enforcement should not be deputized as federal marshals, as Texas
Rangers are who deal with Waco, in any situation where there is possibility of
wrongdoing by federal officers against citizens of state.)  </p>

<li><p>Congress Should Make A Clear and Constitutional Policy on "Armed
Groups"</p>

<p> Appendix G of the Treasury Dept. report on Waco is "A Brief
History of Federal Firearms Enforcement" and traces that history
from Shay's Rebellion (1786) through the civil war, prohibition,
and up to the present where they list several rightwing, tax
resisting, gun holding survivalists they've attacked and burned
out.  Waco was not the first.    </p>

<p> What is particularly of interest here is the statement: "The
raid by ATF agents on the Branch Davidian compound resulted from
its enforcement of contemporary federal firearms laws.  In a
larger sense, however, the raid fit within an historic, well-
established and well-defended government interest in prohibiting
and breaking up all organized groups that sought to arm or
fortify themselves ... From its earliest formation, the federal
government has actively suppressed any effort by disgruntled or
rebellious citizens to coalesce into an armed group, however
small the group, petty its complaint, or grandiose its ambition. 
The collection of large arsenals by organized groups lent itself,
ultimately, to the violent use of those weapons against the
government itself or portions of its citizenry. Indeed, federal
agents who tried to disband the groups frequently became the
targets."  (Appendix G, Page 7)</p>

<p> Finally, we know their true motivation for all this! So one thing that must
be demanded of Congress is an exact definition of "armed groups" -- how many
and what kinds of guns held by how many individuals in what kind of "group" is
considered an armed group which must be broken up?    </p>

<title>Davidian David Thibodeaux</title>
<!-- Place: Waco, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: fire April 1993 -->

<body>

<h1>David Thibodeaux</h1>

<p>David Thibodeaux is one of the Branch Davidians who escaped the fire. I'm not
sure if his name is spelled correctly; posters on the net spelled it
Thibedeaux and Thibodeau.<p>

<hr>

<p>Paul Watson (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:pwatson@utdallas.edu">pwatson@utdallas.edu</a>) reported on a
meeting of the Citizens for Legal Reform in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>:</p>

<p> ... The next speaker was David Thibedeaux who escaped the day of the 
fire. David said 22 people were assassinated by snipers as they ran out 
the back of the building. He said they got one of the cases the CS gas 
was in and it has a warning label "not to be used in closed areas/may 
cause death/for open area riot control only." He also said CS is not a gas 
but a powder that is inflammable in a closed area. David said the Texas 
Health and Human Services had came out to investigate all of the child 
abuse charges and had medically inspected all of the children and found 
no evidence of sex or child abuse and in fact they said they were the 
most polite, happy and well mannered kids they had ever had the pleasure 
of working with.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've lost the author and date of the following report:</p>

<p> We were fortunate to have as guest speaker at our weekly meeting
last week, David Thibedeaux, one of the nine sole survivors of the
Mount Carmel incident and the only one not to be indicted so far.</p>

<p> He is a young man - early 30's probably and spoke very passionately
about the his 3 years living amongst his friends and family at Mt. Carmel </p>

<p>... Some of his key points:</p>

<p> At the time of the fire many tried to escape as quickly as possible through
various exits. The nine that survived happened to exit on side of the building
that was being covered by video camera -- he claims the government killed all
others except those on camera.</p.

<p> 25 people exited safely through the back exit. These same people were also
reported being killed by bullet wounds to the head ...</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/G/MatthewGaylor.html">Matthew Gaylor</a>
posted the following to Libernet on June 18, 1995:</p>

<p>David Thibodeau, a theological scholar, was researching the Branch
Davidians when the initial assault by the BATF occurred in 1993. Trapped
in the crossfire, Thibodeau escaped the Davidian siege shortly before the
firestorm, and was a material witness in the ensuing trial. Thibodeau was
and is not a Branch Davidian, and is the only survivor not charged or
imprisoned as a result of the incident.</p>

<title>Waco Survivors Sue U.S.</title>

<h1>Waco Survivors Sue U.S.</h1>

<p>By Mike Drago, Associated Press Writer</p>

<p> HOUSTON (AP) - Branch Davidians and their survivors sued the government
for $63.5 million Monday [February 28, 1995], claiming it meant for church 
members to die in the federal raid on their compound and the fire that 
destroyed it. "This is a fundamentally different approach than any of the
other lawsuits," said lawyer James Brannon, who filed the lawsuit in federal
court.</p>

<p> "The others claim that the government made mistakes," he said.  "This  is
the only one that takes a position that they calculatedly destroyed  the
compound and everything in it. " Nearly a dozen civil lawsuits have been filed
by federal agents and by Davidians.  None have gone to trial yet. </p>

<title>Hong Kong's Economic Policies</title>
<!-- Place: Hong Kong -->
<!-- Time: report 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Hong Kong's Economic Policies</h1>

<p>1993, from Daniel Lam of Melbourne, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Oceania/Australia/">Australia</a>:</p>

<p>Well, I was born in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/HongKong/">Hong Kong</a> and visited there
last month.</p>

<p>I know of no convenient reference for finding out about HK economic
policies, but you can always try the HK government, I guess.  Here I
will just present some facts which I discovered while there.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Free Trade. There are no protective tariffs. There are import duties on a
few items for revenue purposes, alcohol and cigarettes, I think. Duties on
cosmetics was abolished on April 1, when the new budget came into effect.</p>

<li><p>Personal Income Tax. There is tax-free allowance of HK$56000 (about
US$7000). For income above that there is a single rate (I think) of about
15%.</p>

<li><p>Welfare. There is no social security scheme, and no unemployment benefits.
The only form of direct welfare I can think of which exists is old-age
pensions.</p>

<li><p>Economy. Unemployment is less than 2%. The "world-wide economic recession"
which mysteriously hit the world despite the best efforts of governments to
protect their peoples seems to have missed Hong Kong, whose government was
grossly negligent and didn't do a thing.</p>

<li><p>Labour laws. There are no minimum-wage laws like in the U.S., or, worse
still, the kind of centralized arbitration we have in Australia. There are
some laws and regulations governing safety and the like.</p>

<li><p>Health. There are public hospitals where very cheap subsidized health
care is available. There is no state health insurance scheme, nothing like
Medicaid or Medicare. If you want to get (almost) free health care, you go to
a public hospital and join the queue. If you go to a private doctor, you pay.
I should also say that the HK Medical Association, like the AMA, controls the
registration of doctors.</p>

<li><p>Education. There is compulsory education up until an age which I don't
remember. There are public schools and private schools but most schools are
privately run religious schools subsidized by the government.</p>

<li><p>Guns. HK has draconian gun-control laws. It is a British colony, after
all.</p>

<li><p>ID cards. All HK residents are required to have and carry with them a HK
identity card. Visitors are "advised" to carry identification with them. This
measure is intended to catch illegal immigrants from <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China</a>, who are sent back
immediately, unless they claim asylum or refugee status and succeed.</p>

<li><p>Housing. A lot of people (something like 25%) live in government housing,
although the government is trying to move them to private housing. This doesn't
stop the private real estate market from boiling constantly. Real estate is
extremely expensive, and is rising constantly. Almost everybody in HK lives in
a flat. Houses are only for the fabulously rich. I had great difficulty in
comprehending the notion of a "suburb" when I first came to Australia.</p>

<li><p>Shopping. This is the most important thing. There are no restrictions on
hours of trading. Shops are open on weekends and late into the night.</p>

</ol>

<p>As you can see from this list, HK has a very high degree of economic freedom,
and quite good personal freedom, excellent compared with its neighbours. Four
more years to go ...</p>

<title>Transition to Free Market</title>
<!-- Place: ? (USA) -->
<!-- Time: October 15, 1993 or 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Czech Transition from Communism to the Free Market</h1>

<p>Of the former Soviet bloc nations, the Czech Republic has made
the most progress towards tranforming its economy into a free market,
and became the only nation in the world whose Prime Minister was
an Austrian school economist. "Coincidentally" it is also the most
prosperous of formerly communist nations as well as the one with
the most vibrant culture.</p>

<h2>How to Move Boldly Towards Freedom</h2>

<p>The following remarks were made by
<A href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/CzechRepublic/">Czech</a> Prime Minister
<a href="/revolution/by_name/K/VaclavKlaus.html">Vaclav Klaus</a> on
October 15th, 1993 or 1994 in a speech at the Heritage Foundation.</p>

<p>I believe that the Czech Republic has already crossed the 
Rubicon dividing the old and the new regime. We may become 
the proof that the transformation from communism to a free 
society can be realized.</p>

<p>The systemic transformation is not an exercise in applied 
economics or in applied political science; it is a process 
which involves human beings, which affects their day-to-day 
life, which creates new groups of gainers and losers, which 
changes the relative political and economic strength and 
standing of different socio-economic groups and which, 
therefore, destroys the original political, social and 
economic equilibrium.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To be successful, the political leaders must formulate and 
sell to the citizens of the country a positive vision of a 
future society. The first task is its formulation; the vision 
must be positive (not just a negative one); it must be 
straight-forward; it must motivate; it must speak to the 
hearts of the men and women who spent most of their lives in 
the spiritually empty communist regime. The second task, to 
sell the vision, is much more complicated. It requires to 
address the people, to argue, to explain, to defend; it 
requires permanent campaigning. It requires more than a good 
communication system, more than sophisticated information 
technology, more than free and independent mass media. It 
requires the formation of standard political parties because 
without them the politicians have no real power base. </p>

<li><p>The necessary set of reform steps includes both changes of 
institutions and changes of behavioral and regulatory rules. 
Institutional changes take time, changes of rules, however, 
can and must be done very fast. Much of the disagreement 
about the speed of transformation (shock-therapy or 
gradualism) can be dispelled if a proper distinction is made 
between the speed of those two conceptually different 
transformation tasks. </p>

<li><p>Such a fundamental change of an entire society cannot be 
dictated by a priori, prearranged procedures. Reform 
blueprints must be loose, unpretentious and flexible. The 
dreams of social engineers of all ideological colors to 
organize or to mastermind the whole process of a systemic 
transformation in a rigid way are false, misleading, and 
dangerous. It must be accepted - as an important 
transformation theorem - that it is impossible to centrally 
plan the origin and rise of a free society and of a market economy. </p>

<li><p>The reforms must be bold, courageous, determined, and, 
therefore, painful, because </p>
	<ul>
	<li>Economic activities based on subsidized prices, on 
	artificially created and now nonexistent demands, and on 
	sheltered markets must cease to exist;
	<li>Once-and-for-all price jump after price deregulation is unavoidable;
	<li>Drastic devaluation, inevitable to be introduced before 
	liberalization of foreign trade, shifts the exchange rate 
	very far below the purchasing power parity;
	<li>Income and property disparities grow to an unprecedented level, etc.
	</ul>
</ol>

<p>The costs the people have to bear must be widely shared, 
otherwise the fragile political support is lost. Telling the 
truth, not promising things which cannot be realized, and 
guarding credibility of reform programs and of politicians 
who realize them, are absolute imperatives.</p>

<h2>The Reality of Compromise</h2>

<p>In June 1996 elections, Klaus' free-market Civic Democratic Party (ODS)
fell two seats short of a majority in the Czech parliament. The
second-place Social Democrats, a traditional European welfare state
party, will slow down the liberalization of the Czech economy.</p>

<p>The four major Czech parties accepted an agreement in which the
Social Democrats lead parliament in return for support of a minority
government of the center-right coalition of the other parties. Klaus
will remain prime minister.</p>

<p>The Social Democrats oppose privatization of state-owned utility
and transportation networks, and want more government involvement
in pensions, health care and education.</p>

<title>Russia Rejects Democracy</title>
<!-- Place: Russia -->
<!-- Time: 1990s; commission resigns February 5, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Russia Returns to Communism</h1>

<h2>The Fall of Communism</h2>

<p>Communism destroyed the Soviet Empire. The parasite of socialism
finally drained the last blood from the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russian</a> nation in the late
1980's and 1990's, resulting in a spectacular break-up of Soviet
control.</p>

<p>But freedom did not take hold in Russia. Instead of forging ahead
with property rights and free markets, Russians devolved into a
collection of turf wars, with ethnic groups, former rulers, entrepreneurs,
organized crime and various other groups competing to survive.</p>

<p>Out of the former Soviet-controlled states, the one that proceeded
fastest and furthest with free-market reform -- the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/CzechRepublic/">Czech Republic</a> --
has done the best economically by far. The ones that at least moved
closer to free markets, including Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland,
are doing alright.</p>

<p>Russia, who moved least to free markets, whose economy continued to be
based on payoffs, bribes and tribute, has (surprise) done the worst
economically and culturally. Yet this catastrophe is often blamed on moving
<em>too fast</em> with economic reforms! The blindness, willful or
otherwise, of international commentators continues to astound me.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Communism</h2>

<p>In the mid-1990's, Russia began a decided move back towards
nationalism and communism. President Boris Yeltsin abandoned democratic
allies to appease former hardliners, and imposed numerous crackdowns
on civil liberties.</p>

<p>On February 5, 1996, four members of Russia's presidential human
rights commission resigned, releasing what is likely the commission's
final report. The head of the commission resigned in January and another
member announced plans to resign, leaving only three members on the
commission.</p>

<p>The report said that human rights violations are common is Russia,
that Russia is moving from democracy back to totalitarianism, that
Russia is becoming increasingly militarized, and
that Yeltsin is tolerating the abuses. Examples of human rights abuses
included ethnic hatred, anti-Semitism, xenophobia,
mistreatment of servicemen and prison inmates, free speech restrictions,
government disinformation, war abuses in
<a href="/revolution/multi/war/chechnya.html">Chechnya</a>,
and the renewal of the Soviet practice of issuing residence permits
restricting free movement.</p>

<hr>

<p>Source: February 5, 1996 Associated Press article, "Russian human rights
commission reports gross violations, practically disbands," reprinted
in the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NandO.html">NandO Times</a>.</p>

<h1>Market Process Theory</h1>

<p>This overview of the Austrian school of economics' theory of
entrepreneurship was originally a college paper by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/KenGaillotJr.html">Ken Gaillot</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>The study of economics is based on the premise that there exists
a regularity in economic phenomena, laws as inescapable as the law
of gravity. Economic theory seeks to establish these laws. One
essential aspect of economic theory, the theory of the market, tries
to explain the relationships observed under a system of private
property. Although most economists today follow an equilibrium approach
to market theory, the body of market theory associated with the Austrian
school provides a better understanding of market processes, being
able to explain events that equilibrium analysis cannot.</p>

<p>The Austrian theory of the market is one of market process, of
action, change and uncertainty. Exponents of Austrian economics,
also called subjectivist economics, explain economic activity in
terms of its ultimate cause, purposeful human action. Austrians
believe an economic theory is valid for situations in which its
assumptions are present, if the theory is logically consistent.</p>

<p>Conventional neoclassical equilibrium analysis takes a fundamentally
different approach. Reality is to be modeled, as it is in the natural
sciences, tested against empirical data, and refined if necessary.
Models make assumptions to simplify reality and focus on areas of
interest. An economic theory is valid for reality if the results it
predicts are present in the situation and the theory is logically
consistent.</p>

<title>Air Control Dangers</title>
<!-- Time: September 1994 - August 1995 -->
<!-- Place: USA -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Government-run Air Control Dangerous</h1>

<p>The deregulated, private, competitive U.S. airlines are the envy of the
world when it comes to safety, state-of-the-art technology and affordability.
But the government-run U.S. air traffic control system is in a shambles,
relying on quarter-century old computer equipment and suffering major
personnel problems.</p>

<p>Air traffic control computers are long overdue for replacement, some being
more than twenty-five years old. Some are so old that replacement parts are
unavailable. Despite this, the Federal Aviation
Administration is cutting back on its maintenance budget, eliminating
training and cutting back on hiring.</p>

<p>In some centers, half the technicians are eligible to retire. Because of
planned reductions in benefits, many will retire in the next year or two.</p>

<p>Air traffic control centers have experienced major trouble relating to
their computer and personnel problems. Although the problems have not yet
caused a crash, they have caused delays costing millions of dollars.
The FAA counted eleven failures between September 1994 and
August 1995.</p>

<p>On-board collision-avoidance systems were the only savior of two
American Airlines passenger planes led by faulty controller information
towards a head-on collision.</p>

<p>Other problems have included "ghost targets" (planes that exist only on
air traffic control screens), real planes that don't show up on screen and
frequent flickers.</p>

<p>Government is simply not an efficient producer of consumer products,
whether food, health care or air traffic control. U.S. air traffic control
will be the envy of the world when it is run by U.S. businesses and not the
U.S. government.</p>

<title>Sky's the Limit</title>
<!-- Place: Montana (USA) -->
<!-- Time: December 1995 -->

<body>

<h1>Montana Ends Speed Limit</h1>

<p>Before 1973, highway speed limits were properly the realm of individual
states. The states owned the roads, the Constitution did not say anything
about speed limits, so the states set the speed limits.</p>

<p>In 1973, as part of the creeping slime-mold-like growth of the
federal government, the U.S. Congress mandated a national 55 mile per hour
speed limit in response to a supposed oil crisis. When the oil "crisis"
went away with deregulation of oil prices, the speed limit stayed, with
the new rationale of "saving lives." (Of course, zero miles per hour would
save even more lives.)</p>

<p>In 1995, Congress finally repealed the national speed limit, once
again leaving the matter up to the states. In December 1995,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mt/">Montana</a>
became the first state to repeal the daytime speed limit on major
highways altogether.</p>

<p>Montana law currently sets a nighttime speed limit of 65 mph, and
a daytime speed limit of "reasonable and proper" (as defined by patrolmen,
subject to judges' and juries' review). Trucks are still limited to 65 mph
during the day and 55 at night. As to what is reasonable and proper,
one patrolman said, "Anything in triple digits is probably a ticket."
Probably.</p>

<p>Critics are worried that tires and engines will wear out more quickly,
and of course that the death rate will skyrocket as deer go flying through
windshields at 100mph. My advice to the critics: take the bus.</p>

"With speed limits untied by Washington, drivers' eyes are on Montana,"

<h2>O'Rourke on Car Safety</h2>

<p>A car used to be a simple piece of machinery, something like a very fast
rider mower but better because you couldn't mow the lawn with it. You started
this up, drove off at pretty much any speed you desired, and then exercised
a variety of constitutionally guaranteed liberties, usually by having sex and
accidents.</p>

<p>No more -- nowadays if a car cannot survive a fall from the Gateway Arch
and emits any vapors more noxious than Evening in Paris, the federal
government won't let you own it, and what they will let you own you can't
really drive, because fifty-five miles an hour is the speed at which a
spirited person parallel-parks, not motors to

<h2>Barry on Speed Limits</h2>

<p>I'd also like to see speed limits that take into account what song
you're listening to on the radio. Ideally, if a police officer pulled
you over for doing, say, 95 mph in a 75 zone, and you could prove
to him that you were listening to the Isley Brothers' version of
"Twist and Shout," he would not only have to let you off, but he would
also be required, by law, to sing along with you.</p>

<title>Tax Resisteer Wins</title>
<!-- Place: Chattanooga, Tennessee (USA) -->
<!-- Time: case filed October 15, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Tax Resister Beats IRS</h1>

<p>Lloyd L. Long believes that the income tax is voluntary and refuses
to pay it. The IRS took him to court and lost.</p>

<p>As reported by Bill Keller in January 1994 in the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/Chattanooga.html">Chattanooga</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/">Tennessee</a>
<cite>Independence News Opinion</cite>, and by Lamarr Hardy in the Boise,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/id/">Idaho</a>-based
<cite>Alert</cite>, Long was defended by attorneys Lowell Becraft of Huntsville, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/al/">Alabama</a> and Russell J.
Leonard of Sewanee, Tennesee.</p>

<p>Long testified that, based on his study of the Internal Revenue Code
(Title 26), he believes the income tax is an excise tax applicable only
to certain persons, and not the majority of citizens (including himself).
Long says Internal Revenue Code Sections 1441-1443 applies the income tax
only to nonresident aliens and U.S. citizens living abroad in a country where
a tax treaty exists with the United States.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Curtis Collier, representing the Internal Revenue Service,
took a different view. The IRS prosecuted Long for willfully failing to file
tax returns for 1989 and 1990 as "required by law."</p>

<p>Long admitted he had income in excess of $49,000 in each of those years and
that he did not file a return. <cite>Alert</cite> described the defense's
evidence that he was not required to do so:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defense testimony showed a case titled <cite>Brushaber v. Union Pacific
Railroad</cite> wherein it was the unanimous decision of the U.S. Supreme
Court that the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution did not give Congress
any new power to tax any new subjects; it merely tried to simplify the
way in which the tax was imposed.  The ruling also showed that the income tax
was, in fact, an excise tax on corporate privileges and privileged
occupations.</p>

<p>The defense then brought out a case entitled <cite>Flint v.  Stone Tracy
Co.</cite> wherein an excise tax was defined as being a tax laid upon the
manufacture, sale and consumption of commodities within the country; upon
licenses to pursue certain occupations; and upon corporate privileges.</p>

<p>Long's attorneys also brought out a case entitled <cite>Simins v.
Arehns</cite> wherein the court ruled that the income tax was neither a
property tax nor a tax upon occupations of common right, but was an excise
tax.</p>

<p>Next the defense turned to the case of <cite>Redfield v.  Fisher</cite>.
In this instance, the court ruled that an individual, unlike the corporation,
cannot be taxed for the mere privilege of existing, but that the individual's
right to live and own property was a natural right upon which an excise
cannot be imposed.  Defense also pointed to several studies done by the
Congressional Research Service showing the income tax is an excise.</p>

<p>A Tennessee Supreme Court case, <cite>Jack Cole v.  Commissioner</cite>,
provided the fifth defense argument. Here, the court ruled that citizens are
entitled by right to income or earnings and that right could not be taxes as
a privilege.</p>

<p>Finally, Long's legal team pointed to another Tennessee Supreme Court
case, <cite>Corn v. Fort</cite>, in which the court ruled that individuals
have a right to combine their activities as partnerships; and that this is
a natural right, independent and antecedent of government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The defense presented additional arguments that the IRS knew no one
was liable for the income tax. Other IRS-administered taxes, such as the
alcohol tax, are very clearly worded as to who is liable. The IRS' Mission
Statement states that the income tax relies on "voluntary compliance."</p>

<p>Long had built a paper trail in his defense before the trial. He had
written letters asking the IRS direct questions such as, "Am I required to
file federal income tax returns?" and "Am I liable for federal income
taxes?" The IRS never directly answered Long's questions, at which point
Long stopped filing tax returns.</p>

<p>The jury found Long not guilty on all counts.</p>

<p>The Research Foundation provides information to individuals who want to
challenge the IRS. Write to Lamarr Hardy, Executive Director, The
Research Foundation, POB 29265, Honolulu, HI 96720.</p>

<p> This was Case Number CR-1-03-91, <cite>U.S. v. Lloyd Long</cite>, filed in
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Tennessee, October 15, 1993.

<title>Posse Comitatus Organization</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1930's - present -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Posse Comitatus</h1>

<p>February 19, 1995, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/G/IanGeldard.html">Ian
Geldard</a>:</p>

<p>There have been several recent references to the Posse Comitatus. In 
order to enlighten libernet readers a little further about them, I have 
drafted this little backgrounder. I have more information and would be 
happy to prepare a more detailed paper if there is sufficient interest 
(along with any corrections and additions that may come my way). Please 
note that I don't read libernet-d, and so any comments should be sent to 
me directly.</p>

<h2>The Posse Comitatus</h2>

<p>Posse Comitatus is (or was) an organisation composed of loosely
affiliated bands which have been around since 1969. The name Posse
Comitatus is Latin for "power of the county", and the Posse believes
that all government power is rooted at the county level.</p>

<p>Their ideology is largely based on the Posse Comitatus Act passed in
the wake of the Civil War specifically to bar the federal military
from interfering in local police matters. In response to President
Grant's post Civil War efforts to use troops to guard ballot boxes
and prevent election fraud, Congress had ordered that such police
powers rest only at the county level. Federal troops were barred from
enforcing domestic laws.</p>

<p>Modern Posse adherents assert that the Posse Comitatus principle means
that no citizen is bound to obey any authority higher than that of the
county sheriff. Paying income tax, making social security payments,
using license plates and driving licenses violate this principle.
Many, but not all Posse members also believe that the Posse doectrine
was divinely revealed by God and therefore to pay taxes is not only
illegal but sinful. Some of these "religious" Posse members are
associated with the "Identity" churches which believe, among other
things, that Jews are the spawn of Satan and that blacks are not
humans at all, but animals in disguise.</p>

<p>The formation of the Posse Comitatus "movement" has been traced to
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/or/Portland.html">Portland</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/or/">Oregon</a>, when a
retired dry-cleaning executive named Henry
Lamont "Mike" Beach formed the first Posse chapter, called the
Sherriff's Posse Comitatus (SPC) or Citizen's Law Enforcement Research
Committee (CLERC). Beach had been a controversial Pacific Northwest
right-winger ever since the early 1930s when he was a leader of a
group of American Hitler-worshippers who called themselves the Silver
Shirts <a href="#note">[1]</a>. At about the same time as the formation of the
SPC, retired Army Colonel William Potter Gale founded the US Christian
Posse Association in Glendale, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>.</p>

<p>According to a 1986 report by analysts for the IRS, in the first
manual for the Posse, Beach wrote: [O]fficials of government who
commit criminal acts or who violate their oath of office ... shall be
removed by the posse to the most populated intersection of streets in
the township and, at high noon, be hung by the neck, the body
remaining until sundown as an example to those who would subvert the
law." The advisory went on to claim that "members associated with some
of the Posse groups wear tiny gold hangmen's nooses on their lapels."</p>

<p>Beginning in 1983, the Posse Comitatus became the focus of widespread
media attention when Gordon W. Kahl, a longtime Posse member allegedly
shot and killed two US marshals and wounded three other law
enforcement officers in a shootout near Medina,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nd/">North Dakota</a>. The two
marshals had been trying to arrest Kahl in an income tax case when the
shooting occured. Kahl became a fugitive, until he himself was shot
and killed by an
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ar/">Arkansas</a> sheriff.
In that shootout, when Kahl was
killed, the house in which he was hiding went up in flames as the
shots were said to have ignited "thousands of rounds of ammunition,"
and the sheriff was also killed.</p>

<h2><a name=note>Note</a></h2>

<p>[1] The Silver shirts were founded in Asheville,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nc/">North Carolina</a>, by
William Dudley Pelley, a New Englander of "uncontaminated English
Stock", in 1933, the day after Hitler came to power. His followers
dressed themselves in silver shirts, blue corduroy knickers and gold
stockings. I wonder what the Gestapo would have thought of them had
they turned up at a Nazi rally in Germany!</p>

<title>IRS Incompentence</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: report April 15, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>IRS Often Wrong</h1>

<p>April 15, 1995, from the <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato
Institute</a>:</p>

<p>This year some 40 million Americans will clash with the Internal Revenue
Service.  In a new Cato Institute study, "Why You Can't Trust the IRS,"
author Daniel J. Pilla says in a rising number of these confrontations, the
taxpayer is right, and the $7.6 billion IRS is wrong.</p>

<p>In the study (Policy Analysis no. 222) Pilla finds that despite a doubling
of its budget over the past 10 years and a nearly 20 percent increase in
enforcement personnel, the IRS is increasingly incapable of administering
and enforcing the nation's tax law.</p>

<p>Pilla cites the following as among the reasons the IRS can no longer be 
trusted.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The IRS telephone taxpayer assistance program provides about 8.5
million Americans the wrong answer to even the most basic inquiries
about tax laws.</p>

<li><p>This year roughly 10 million Americans will receive correction
notices from the IRS assessing about $4 billion.  About half of
those notices will be erroneous.</p>

<li><p>About 40 percent of the revenues the IRS collects through penalty
assessments are abated when citizens challenge the penalties.  In 1993
taxpayers were overcharged $5 billion.</p>

<li><p>A General Accounting Office audit of the IRS in 1993 found
widespread evidence of financial malfeasance and gross negligence.
The IRS could not account for 64 percent of its congressional appropriation.</p>

</ul>

<p>Pilla says the IRS fails to meet the standards of financial accountability
and diligence that it imposes on the citizenry.  Since the IRS can no longer
adequately police itself, it can no longer be trusted with the authority to
police individual American businesses and taxpayers.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>

<p>The time has come to abolish our complicated, intrusive and ineffective
income tax system.  Never before has the political will and popular mandate
converged in support for structural overhaul of our tax system.  Both
politicians and the public are now calling for a simplified, fair and
effective tax collection system.  Pilla says policymakers should act
now -- abolish the IRS and replace it with a national sales tax.</p>

<p>The study can be ordered for $4.00 from Cato Institute Books at
1-800-767-1241.</p>

<h2>Difference Between Taxes and Theft</h2>

<p>The highwayman takes solely upon himself the responsibility, danger,
and crime of his own act. He does not pretend that he has any rightful
claim to your money, or that he intends to use it for your own benefit ...
Furthermore, having taken your money, he leaves you, as you wish him to
do. ... He does not keep "protecting" you, by commanding you to bow down
and serve him; by requiring you to do this, and forbidding you to do that.</p>

Spooner</a>, in <cite>No Treason</cite> (1870).</p>

<p>The consequences arising from the continual accumulation of public
debts in other countries ought to admonish us to be careful to prevent

<title>Education and the Industrial Revolution</title>
<!-- Place: England (UK) -->
<!-- Time: 1800's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Education and the Industrial Revolution</h1>

<p>May 1993, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David
Friedman</a>:</p>

<p> I have just been reading a fascinating book: <cite>Education and the Industrial
Revolution</cite> by E. G. West. It is a history of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> education through
the 19th century, and is interesting for three reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It provides strong evidence that a fully private system of education can
do a reasonable job of providing for the working class of (by modern
standards) a poor society. England around 1830, before the first government
subsidies of education, spent about 1 % of GNP on schooling. Fifty years
later, with a large government run sector rapidly replacing the private
sector, the figure was about 1.1%. And this was a period when incomes were
rising sharply, so one would expect relative spending on schooling to rise
(given that education seems to be a superior good) anyway.</p>

<p> West provides comparisons to a variety of other countries, including
Germany and the U.S., which had compulsory government run systems earlier
than Britain. So far as one can tell (the data, of course, are not very
good) both input and output measures (average number of years of
schooling--there do not seem to be any measures of quality of output that
are really comparable across countries) suggest that the British private
system in the early part of the century was doing as well as or better than
the other systems then and later.</p>

<li><p>It is an interesting account of how historical myths get created and
propagated. Numbers purporting to show the failure of the British system
were generated as part of the political process, then used uncritically by
later historians--who ignored other numbers, sometimes with much solider
evidence, that pointed the other direction. The most popular trick was to
compare the number of children in school by the number of children in a
specified age range, such as 3-13, and imply that the difference
represented children who never saw the inside of a school. Where detailed
studies were done, it typically turned out that almost everyone was going
to school, but for an average of less than ten years (I think about six).
The Prussian compulsory system, to which British reformers pointed, claimed
to have everyone in school--but for seven years, not the ten which the
reformers were using to calculate the gap in the British system.</p>

<p> Also, the reformers made much of Scotland's supposedly superior national
system of schools. It turns out that by the early 19th century, only a
third of the Scottish students were at (government run and subsidized)
Parish schools, with two thirds at private ("adventure") schools. And even
the Parish schools seem to have received the majority of their income from
school fees.</p>

<li><p>It is also an interesting account of the dark side of Benthamite
utilitarianism. There was a definite tendency for utilitarians to be in
favor of individual freedom in theory but centralized state direction (run
by them) in practice. On education, the division was between Bentham and
his disciples as the bad guys and Godwin as the good guy (arguing, among
other things, that the state was the last place in the world you would want
to go for moral instruction of the young), with John Stuart Mill caught in
the middle and straddling the fence. It appears, incidentally, that
vouchers were invented, at least in the 19th century, by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/P/ThomasPaine.html">Tom Paine</a>.</p>

</ol>

<p>In any case, I recommend the book highly. </p>

<title>Separation of School and State</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Separation of School and State</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/C/ChrisCardiff.html">Chris Cardiff</a>
posted a FAQ for the <a href="/revolution/by_name/S/SSSA.html">Separation
of School and State Alliance</a> to Libernet which is excerpted below.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why should school and state be separated?</h2>

<p>We should remove schools from government operation and influence for three
reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>One-size-fits-all doesn't work in a pluralistic society, especially for
character values.
<li>Government take-over of parents' duties is often met with parental
abdication of their responsibilities. Reduced parental responsibility hurts
children.
<li>Politically-run schooling can't escape the age-graded time-based model
imported from Prussia in the 1840s. Those offering glimpses of better
paradigms (e.g., John Holt, Maria Montessori) are all but scorned.
</ul>

<p>Our goal is the end of federal, state, and local involvement with
schooling. We believe government has no role in financing, operating, or
defining schooling, or even compelling attendance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What's wrong with the common school concept?</h2>

<p>We don't have a common pizza, a common magazine or a common church. They
make no common sense. The way out of the "School Wars" is to drop the
1840s' notion of a "common school." Government has no business forcing kids
from different backgrounds into a one-size-fits-all tablet of values. The
Common School wasn't so bad for 100 years; they imparted the Protestant
majority's values to mostly Protestant kids. Some groups escaped (e.g.,
Christian Reformed, Seventh Day Adventist, and Catholics); others were
small and took their lumps (e.g., Jews, atheists, and Jehovah's Witnesses).</p>

<p>The flaw of the common school only became clear to traditionalists when the
tables were turned on them. Over the last 50 years, the modernists have won
control and now they use schools to impart their idea of "The Good." But
the traditionalists are not a tiny minority that can be abused with
impunity. They're escalating the school wars to try to "take back their
schools." Parent support for teachers is plummeting. Compromise is not
possible: Some want prayer in school, some want condoms. Printing prayers
on condoms satisfies nobody. Communities are split. Some even have to use
police to maintain order at school board meetings.</p>

<p>The way to get parents to support schools is for schools to support
parents, especially their tablet of virtues and values. Cultural and
religious pluralism in parents means we need the same pluralism in schools.
Kids are now being injured in the psychological equivalent of a vicious
custody battle.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What about irresponsible parents?</h2>

<p>The 1840s' municipal takeover of schools told parents they weren't
responsible for their children's education. It's the government's job. The
1890s' compulsory attendance legislation relieved parents of the awesome
burden of convincing children to attend school. It's the government's job.
The 1930s' Social Security told children they weren't responsible for their
elderly parents. It's the government's job.</p>

<p>The last three decades brought us government breakfast, lunch, health care
and after-school care. When governments usurp, many parents abdicate their
responsibility. Family life is weakened and children are harmed. This
usurpation/abdication two-step has been ratcheting downward for 150 years
and has been accelerating in the last 40 years. Government attempts to
rescue children from poor parenting are the great enabler of irresponsible
parenting.</P>

<hr>

<h2>What's wrong with the Prussian approach?</h2>

<p>The factory-model school was designed when children were more obedient and
the restless ones were allowed to learn by apprenticeship. Today's system
is a dysfunctional pressure cooker. Educators know better ways but politics
forces them to keep re-formulating the age-segregated, competition-driven,
time-based system designed by Prussians after their defeat by Napoleon.
Getting government out of schooling will allow the market to test
potentially good ideas invented by creative educators.</p>

<title>The Weak Case for Public Schooling</title>
<!-- Author: David Friedman, July 7, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1 align=center>The Weak Case for Public
Schooling<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></h1>
<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David Friedman</a></p>

<p>It is often said that Adam Smith, despite his general belief in
Laissez-faire, made an exception for education. That is not entirely true.
In the course of a lengthy and interesting discussion, Smith argues both
that education is a legitimate government function, at least in some societies,
and that it is a function which governments perform very badly. His conclusion
is that while it is legitimate for government to subsidize education,
it may be more prudent to leave education entirely
private.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p>My purpose in this essay is to argue that Smith's conjecture was correct
While government schooling,<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> free and compulsory, is at present
nearly universal in developed societies, the case for it is unconvincing.
There are arguments for government provision of schooling, as there are
arguments for government provision of any good or service, but the arguments
in favor are weaker, and the arguments against stronger, than the
corresponding arguments for other goods and services that we routinely
leave to the private market.</p>

<hr>
<h2>The Arguments In Favor of Government Schooling</h2>

<p>The arguments in favor of government involvement in schooling can be
roughly divided into four groups: Externality arguments, information
arguments, capital market failure arguments, and egalitarian arguments.
I will deal with them in that order.</p>

<ul>
<li><A href="externality.html">Externality Arguments</a></li>
<li><A href="information.html">Information Arguments</a></li>
<li><a href="capital.html">Capital Market Failure</a></li>
<li><a href="egalitarian.html">The Egalitarian Argument</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a href="history.html">History</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><i>In many areas of human activity there are two histories -- the
popular history, mostly mythological, and the real history ...</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2><a href="voucher.html">The Voucher Alternative</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><i>I have been considering two alternatives -- government and private
schooling. Another alternative, in some ways intermediate between the two,
is for the state to provide a fixed amount per pupil per year ...</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2><a href="conclusion.html">Conclusion</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><i>... Whether or not it is proper to have a
government system of schooling, it is prudent not to.</i></p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p><a name="fn1">1.</a> This article is dedicated to E. G. West, to whom,
allowing for the usual timelag between ideas and policy, our grandchildren
will owe a large debt. Most of my historical discussion is based on
E. G. West,
<a href="/revolution/community/educate/books/west.html"><cite>Education and
the Industrial Revolution</cite></a>,
P.T. Batesford & Co., London 1975.</p>

<p><a name="fn2">2.</a> "The expence of the institutions for education
and religious instruction, is likewise, no doubt, beneficial to the whole
society, and may, therefore, without injustice, be defrayed by the general
contribution of the whole society. This expence, however, might perhaps
with equal propriety, and even with some advantage, be defrayed altogether
by those who receive the immediate benefit of such education and instruction,
or by the voluntary contribution of those who think they have occasion for
either the one or the other." (Adam Smith, <cite>An Inquiry into the Nature and
Causes of the Wealth of Nations</cite>, 1789 edition, E. Cannan ed., 1904
U of Chicago Press,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>:
1976, Bk V, Ch 1, Conclusion, p. ii 340).</p>

<p><a name="fn3">3.</a> I have chosen to refer to "government" rather
than "public" schools and schooling, because I find the latter terminology
misleading. A privately run school may be "public" in the sense that
differentiates a public hotel or restaurant from a private club -- it may
choose to accept all customers willing to pay its price. In this sense, most
government run schools are private, since they accept only students who meet
certain criteria, most commonly geographical. To describe government schools
as "public" on the grounds that they are run by the public is to identify the
public with the state, which I think is a mistake. Avoiding the term
"public school" also avoids confusion between the British and American
usages; a British "public school" is what Americans call a "private school."
I use "government" rather than "state" in the context of schooling in order
to avoid confusion with "state" in the sense of a political subdivision
of a federal system, such as the state of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a>.</p>

<p>-- Lester Frank Ward 1897</p>

<hr>

<h2>Mill on Public Education</h2>

<p>State education is a mere contrivance for molding
people to be exactly alike one another; ... in proportion as it is
efficient and successful, it establishes a despotism over the mind, leading
by a natural tendency to one over the body.</p>

<p>-- John Stuart Mill, 1859</p>

<hr>

<h2>Disraeli on Public Education</h2>

<p>Whenever is found what is called a paternal
government, there is found state education. It has been discovered that the
best way to ensure implicit obedience is to commence tyranny in the nursery.</p>

<p>-- Benjamin Disraeli, 1874</p>

<h1>Social Insecurity</h1>

<p>Somewhere along the line, someone decided that since having a nice old
age requires long-term planning, efficient management of limited resources, and
a compassionate sense of community, we should turn retirement planning over
to the government.</p>

<p>Say what?</p>

<title>Welfare in New York</title>
<!-- Place: New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: report August 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Real Price of New York's Generous Welfare Benefits</h1>

<p>August 1994, from Tom Carroll, President of CHANGE-NY (1-800-851-8881):</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a> state's
welfare benefits are so high that a welfare recipient
would have to work at a job paying nearly $45,000 to break-even, according to
a study released today by CHANGE-NY, a statewide taxpayers organization with
over 100,000 members.</p>

<p>"It is often said that New York provides a Cadillac-style welfare program.
Rolls Royce is more like it," explained Tom Carroll, CHANGE-NY's president.</p>

<p>The CHANGE-NY study documents that the typical welfare recipient (a woman
with two children) is able to receive a tax-free welfare-benefit package
costing taxpayers $32,571 annually.   This figure encompasses the most common
and broadly used welfare programs in New York, including the AFDC basic cash
grant, Medicaid health coverage, and subsidies for food, housing, and energy
cost.</p>

<p>To have after-tax take-home pay of $32,571 from a regular job, a welfare
recipient would have to earn a salary of $44,900 annually, according to
CHANGE-NY.  By comparison, the starting salary for nuclear engineers with
college degrees is $32,200.  The $44,900 figure also is higher than the
statewide median household income, alomst four times the poverty level, and
almost three times the annual unemployment-insurance benefits.</p>

<p>The CHANGE-NY study also noted that sending the welfare recipient to
Harvard University would be cheaper than the current approach.  The cost of
tuition, family housing, meals, <em>and</em> campus health services at Harvard
is $31,692 per year-- less than what New York shells out annually for a welfare
recipient.</p>

<p>Carroll explained that while not everyone makes this much on welfare, many
do.  The example provided -- a woman with two children -- is the typical
recipient, contrary to the common stereotype of a single able-bodied male on
welfare.</p>

<p>"The impulse to be generous to those who fall on hard times is natural --
and commendable.  But the state's taxpayers simply cannot afford <em>this</em>
level of
generosity.  And, this so-called compassion is not in the interests of the
welfare recipient either, who would be better served by self-sufficiency
instead of long-term dependency," Carroll added.</p>

<p>Since 1982, New York has spent more than $180 <em>billion</em> waging the
"War on Poverty."  The result: the state's poverty rate went up, not down.</p>

<p>In 1982, New York had fewer than 1.3 million welfare recipients (AFDC and
Home Relief).  Today, New York has more than 1.6 Million welfare recipients --
a 25 percent increase.</p>

<p>CHANGE-NY today recommended setting a ceiling on the combined amount that
welfare recipients can recieve from all welfare programs, imposing a time
limit on the duration of welfare benefits, and providing welfare recipients
with a universal voucher or debit card in place of the existing web of
complicated, bureau cratic, and expensive individual programs.</p>

<p>ASSISTANCE PROGRAM and ANNUAL AMOUNT: AFDC basic cash grant, $2,856;
Medicaid, $13,664; Housing Assistance, $9,828; Food Assistance, $4,507;
Energy Assistance, $1,716. TOTAL $32,571. Pre-Tax Equivalent of Welfare
Benefit Level $44,900.</p>

<title>Canadians Tiring of Benefits</title>
<!-- Place: Canada -->
<!-- Time: 1990's -->
</head>

<h1>Canadians Reconsidering 'Benefits'</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada</a> in recent
decades began practicing the Santa Claus form of
government, giving its citizens an extensive package of welfare benefits,
from a comprehensive national health care system to generous welfare
allowances.</p>

<p>The predictable outcome of this has been huge increases in government
spending and debt, the steepest tax hikes in any industrialized nation,
income stagnation and rationing of "public" goods.</p>

<P>Federal and provincial Canadian governments are finally seeking to
cut spending in an effort to reduce taxes and debt. Prime minister Jean
Chretian expects significant cuts in health spending, welfare, pensions,
child care, homeless shelters and other entitlement programs.</p>

<p>The libertarian-leaning Reform Party made huge gains in the 1993 elections,
becoming the third-largest party in the lower house of Parliament, after
the Liberal Party and the Bloc Quebecois. The Conservative Party is also
doing well.</p>

<title>National Service</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1993-1996; report released March 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Clinton Puts "Service" in National Service</h1>

<p>When Bill Clinton was elected President in 1992, one of his pet
projects was AmeriCorps, a pie-in-the-sky program administered by
the newly created Corporation for National Service. AmeriCorps was
going to help students pay their way through college by volunteering
for good causes.</p>

<p>Typical of modern day boondoggles, the National Service program was
not presented as yet another massive bureaucracy handing out the dole,
but as an "investment" in the future of the country, funded by a
"public-private partnership".</p>

<p>In March 1996, less than four years after the program's inception,
the corporation's own inspector general announced that the program's
financial books were in such sorry state that they could not even
be audited. The corporation had incomplete and inaccurate records,
did not maintain adequate security over financial data, and ignored
some of the most basic rules of money management.</p>

<p>Not coincidentally, the cost per participant, orginally estimated
at $18,000, turned out to be $27,000.</p>

<p>In 1995, the corporation received nearly half a billion dollars in
government funding. That wild-eyed radical Republican-controlled Senate
recommended slashing that to only a measly four hundred million or so.
This fits in with the Republican motto: "We want a slightly smaller
government than we have today, but bigger than the one we had yesterday."</p>

<p>Libertarians oppose national service programs because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As evidenced above, they needlessly waste enormous sums of
taxpayer money. Whether they waste $400 million or $500 million is
not a useful distinction.</p>

<li><p>In the U.S., national service is not one of the duties assigned
to the federal government by the Constitution. One does not "phase out"
unconstitutional activity, one stops it.</p>

<li><p>"Voluntary" national service programs eventually lead to
a mandatory draft. When proponents see segments of society they don't
like (the rich for example) being underrepresented by volunteers,
they propose a draft to make sure everyone does their "fair share."</p>

<li><p>Government is unsuited to charity and compassion.
Government is force, government is prison, government is the barrel of
a gun. Any government-run attempt at providing charity is doomed to
failure, creating only dependency and undesired incentives.</p>

</ul>

<h1>Quotes on Welfare</h1>

<hr>

<h2>O'Rourke on Poverty</h2>

<p>In comparative terms, there's no poverty in America by a long shot.
Heritage Foundation political scientist Robert Rector has worked up figures
showing that when the official U.S. measure of poverty was developed in 1963,
a poor American family had an income twenty-nine times greater than the
average per capita income in the rest of the world. An individual American
could make more money than 93 percent of the other people on the planet and
still be considered poor.</p>

<p>-- <a href="/revolution/by_name/O/PJORourke.html">P.J. O'Rourke</a>,
in <cite>Parliament of Whores</cite></p>

<hr>

<h2>Jimmy Carter on the Great Society</h2>

<p>I would say of the Great Society programs of the Johnson years, all of
the federal programs that have concentrated on low-income areas, what
I tried to do ... what has been done by other leaders coming after me,
in general the failures have been abject and almost unanimous.</p>

<p>Former President Jimmy Carter, 1995.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Welfare State</h2>

<p>We ask that the government undertake the obligation above all of providing
citizens with adequate opportunity for employment and earning a living.
The activities of the individual must not be allowed to clash with the
interests of the community, but must take place within its confines and be
for the good of all. Therefore, we demand: ... an end to the power of the
financial interests. We demand profit sharing in big business. We demand a
broad extension of care for the aged. We demand ... the greatest possible
consideration of small business in the purchases of national, state, and
municipal governments. In order to make possible to every capable and
industrious [citizen] the attainment of higher education and thus the
achievement of a post of leadership, the government must provide an all-around
enlargement of our entire system of public education ... We demand the
education at government expense of gifted children of poor parents ... The 
government must undertake the improvement of public health - by protecting
mother and child, by prohibiting child labor ...  by the greatest possible
support for all clubs concerned with the physical education of youth. We
combat the  ...  materialistic spirit within and without us, and are
convinced that a permanent recovery of our people can only proceed from
within on the foundation of the common good before the individual good.</p>

<p>-- from the political program of the Nazi Party, adopted in Munich,
on February 24, 1920, quoted in <cite>Die Nationalsozialistische Dokumente
1933-1945</cite>, edited by Walther Hofer, Frankfurt am Mein: Fischer
Bucherei, 1957, pp. 29-31.</p>

<h2><cite>Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do</cite></h2>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/M/PeterMcWilliams.html">Peter McWilliams</a>
has written a masterful book exposing the follies of prohibition for
what they are. <cite>Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do: The Absurdity of
Consensual Crimes in a Free Society</cite> "marshals a vast army of anecdotes,
quotes, statistics and assertions to argue that America would be a lot
better off if we stopped using the force of law to save each other from
drugs, alcohol, gambling, pornography, suicide and sex in its more exotic
flavors," according to the New York <cite>Times</cite>.</p>

<p>The book is fun to read and even browse, as compelling and/or witty
quotes are scattered about everywhere.</p>

<p>McWilliams, in the spirit of creativity unleashed, has put the
entire contents of <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a

<title>Chinese Reproductive Policy</title>
<!-- Place: China -->
<!-- Time: report 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Reproductive Policy in China</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JayManifold.html">Jay Manifold</a>:</p>

<p>Millions of Chinese men and women have been forcibly aborted or sterilized 
under <a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China's</a> "population
control policy."  Hundreds of victims have fled to
America to spare their child's life or who fear their own safety.</p>

<p>Since the Clinton Administration agrees with China's one-child policy, 
refusing to consider it persecution, these immigrants have been held in 
prisons throughout America for almost 2 years.  Their families in China have 
been harshly punished, with fines of up to several years' wages, or their 
homes bulldozed.</p>

<p>First-hand accounts of the one-child policy reveal the inhumane treatement,
including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Incarcerating pregnant women in barracks until they acquiesce to 
abortions and/or sterilizations.

<li>Handcuffing mothers in their last trimester, herding them into cages
and delivering them by the truckload to the operating tables of
abortion clinics.

<li>Carrying out sterilization or abortion without the consent or 
knowledge of the women.

<li>Crushing the skulls of infants with forceps during delivery or 
injecting iodine, alcohol, or formaldehyde into their soft spots as 
they are crowning so that they are born dead.

<li>Cutting off food, electricity, water and wages for couples who refuse
to comply.

<li>Confiscating the furniture, livestock, and even homes of families who
refuse to comply.

<li>Demolishing the homes of those who refuse to comply.

<li>Physical torture of those who refuse to comply.
</ul>

<p>On February 14, 1995, the Chinese government announced a new campaign of
even more rigorous enforcement of the one-child policy.</p>

<p>Federal authorities from the Department of Justice and the INS have used 
deceitful, unethical, and perhaps illegal actions to keep the immigrants in 
jail and to quietly deport them.  The Clinton administration not only supports
China's one-child policy, they subsidize it with tax dollars through foreign
aid for "family planning."</p>

<p>On February 27, 1995, the Fifth Circuit Appellate Court denied the
immigrants' plea for asylum.  They now face deportation back to China, and
certain torture.</p>

<title>Nevada's Prostitution</title>
<!-- Place: Nevada (USA) -->
<!-- Time: current -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Legal Prostitution in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nv/">Nevada</a></h1>

<p>Prostitution is not illegal everywhere. In particular, in the United
States, prostitution is legal in certain counties of Nevada.</p>

<p>State law forbids counties with high populations from legalizing
brothels, so prostitution is illegal in Las Vegas,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nv/Reno.html">Reno</a>,
Carson City and
Lake Tahoe. Other counties may license brothels; street solicitation is
illegal.</p>

<p>Prostitutes are required to use condoms for all types of intercourse,
and must undergo regular medical checkups. The rate of AIDS infection is
nearly zero. Where prostitution is illegal, AIDS rates are often over
25 percent.</p>

<title>Exon's Indecent Bill</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->

	adopted by Senate committee March 23, 1995;
	passed by Senate June 14, 1995;

	panel declares unconstitutional June 12, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</h1>

<p>On Black Thursday, February 8, 1996, after a year of controversy, the
U.S. government enacted the <a href="act.html">Telecommunications Act of
1996</a>, censoring the Internet and other telecommunications networks.
The blatantly unconstitutional law prohibited the transmission of "indecent"
material and information about abortions on telecommunications networks
such as the Internet. Speech that would be perfectly legal in conversation
or in print was <a href="banned.html">banned in the U.S.A.</a>.</p>

<p>In June 1996, a panel of federal judges found that the First Amendment
of the United States Constitution applies to the Internet, guaranteeing
free speech and rendering the indecency provisions of the law null and
void.</p>

<h2>The Exon Act</h2>

<p>On February 1, 1995, U.S. Sen. James Exon (D-<a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ne/">Nebraska</a>) introduced
the Communications Decency Act. His proposal broadened existing
law by subjecting individuals to up to a $100,000 fine or two years in prison
for any "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" message transmitted
over a telecommunications network to a minor or with intention to "annoy,
abuse, threaten or harass."</p>

<p>The initial language of the bill additionally made the telecommunications
network provider (such as an Internet provider or telephone company) criminally
liable for such actions of their users. Later amendments removed this
provision, although providers would still be held liable if they are aware
of the transmission or if they do not a "reasonable effort" (defined by the
FCC) to prevent minors from accessing the material.</p>

<p>In March 1995, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously adopted
a version of the Exon proposal as an amendment to the telecommunications
reform bill. In June 1995, the Senate attached the Exon amendment to the
telecommunications reform bill by a vote of 84-16. On February 1, 1996,
the final bill passed the Senate by a vote of 91-5, and the House of
Representatives by a vote of 414-16. On February 8, 1996, the bill was
signed into law by President Clinton.</p>

<h2>The Internet Reaction</h2>

<p>The Internet community reacted strongly to the threat.
115,000 Internet users signed an online petition to stop the
Exon bill. When the bill passed, thousands of World Wide Web sites protested,
many by participating in a <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.vtw.org/speech/">Web blackout</a>
(setting web pages' backgrounds to black) and displaying images of a
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.eff.org/BlueRibbon/">blue ribbon</a>. Protesters
<a href="winter.html">rallied</a> outside the White House after the
bill passed.</p>

<p>The ACLU challenged the law twice in court, first getting the
Department of Justice to agree not to enforce the law for seven days
while constitutional issues are settled, and then to
<a href="ciec.html">challenge the law</a> in a broad coalition.
An online newspaper <a href="challenge.html">challenged
the law</a> with an indecent commentary on it. Senator Patrick Leahy
offered a <a href="leahy.html">bill to repeal it</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of the challenges, a panel of federal court judges was
convened to decide the issue. On June 12, 1996, the panel unanimously rules
that free speech applies to the Internet, rendering the indecency
provisions unenforceable. The Clinton administration promises to
appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>

<h2>The Meaning of It All</h2>

<p>This asinine affront to American rights exemplefies the approach
of freedom-killers. Today's would-be tyrants always invoke "the children."
The same people who are bankrupting the country; who are ensuring there
will be no <a href="/revolution/community/welfare/ss/">Social Security</a>
remaining when the next generation retires; who are sending American kids
overseas to fight foreign wars; who are diminishing in every respect
U.S. citizens' birthrights of property and freedom; these
are the people who want to protect children! These are the honorable men
and women, trying to protect us. God save us from our protectors.</p>

<p>Note to U.S. voters: this law enjoyed the widespread support of both
Democrats and Republicans. Bob Dole voted for the Exon amendment, as did
supposed "libertarian Republicans" like Phil Gramm, Jon Kyl, Connie Mack and
Paul Coverdell. Democrats were no better, with the Clinton administration
leading the charge. Only Libertarians are worth your vote! The
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
was the <em>only</em> political party that participated in the net-wide
anti-CDA campaign, the <em>only</em> party to participate in the Web
blackout, and the <em>only</em> party to condemn the censorship.</p>

<title>Immorality of Drug Prohibition</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Immorality of Drug Prohibition</h1>

<p>Prohibition of recreational drugs is morally wrong. Far from a noble cause,
drug prohibition has its roots in <a href="bigotry.html">bigotry and
hatred</a>. Prohibition is a <a href="rights.html">violation of individual
rights</a>.</p>

<p>While prohibition of drug use is wrong, that does not affect whether drug
use is itself right or wrong. It means, rather, that drug use is a moral
decision made by the individual without the threat of force.</p>

<title>Drug Usage</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Drug Usage</h1>

<p>Drug prohibition leads to more dangerous drugs, and slightly encourages
drug use through constant advertisement and the "forbidden fruit" effect.
Despite this, and despite the "toughness" of enforcement, drug prohibition
has little effect on broad patterns of drug usage.</p>

<h2>Prohibition = More Concentrated Drugs</h2>

<p>The economics of smuggling lead smugglers to seek more concentrated
forms of drugs. Thus, during alcohol Prohibition in the U.S., we had
"bathtub gin" and "bootleg whiskey:" harder forms of alcohol were favored
over more moderate drinks such as beer and wine. When opium was made illegal,
smugglers switched first to morphine and later to heroin. When cocaine was
made illegal, smugglers switched from relatively mild coca drinks to powder
cocaine and later smokable (crack) cocaine. Since marijuana was made illegal,
its potency has steadily increased.</p>

<p>With legalization, people generally prefer moderate drug usage. Since
Prohibition, hard alcohol usage has declined in favor of beer and wine, which
are actually beneficial to health in moderation. "Tar" content in tobacco
(a legal drug, today) declined steadily after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
allowed tobacco companies to compete on that basis. When other recreational
drugs were legal, relatively few users chose the most concentrated forms.</p>

<h2>Prohibition Encourages Drug Use</h2>

<p>Although explicitly condemning drug use, prohibition often has the
unintended side effect of promoting drug use among certain parts of the
population.</p>

<p>Teenagers naturally rebel against authority figures and mandates of any
sort. Prohibition, with its "Because I told you so" logic, sets up a
"forbidden fruit" effect, turning drug usage into a statement of rebellion.</p>

<p>Prohibitionists are dependent on publicity to keep the public convinced that
their efforts are needed. As such, drug users and dealers get much more
publicity than they would under legalization. Many groups have documented
increases in drug usage with increases in publicity. See, for example, Consumer
Reports' <cite>Licit and Illicit Drugs</cite> for how one newspaper managed to
spread "glue sniffing" to the entire country.</p>

<p>Use of the drug Ecstasy peaked years <em>after</em> it was
made illegal in 1985. This may partially be attributed to the "forbidden
fruit" effect and the widespread publicity the drug received after becoming
illegal.</p>

<p>Another side effect of prohibition is to cause some users to switch from
more-prosecuted drugs to less-prosecuted ones. Thus, when marijuana laws are
strongly enforced, use of hard alcohol goes up. When cocaine enforcement was
strengthened, heroin made a comeback.</p>

<h2>Prohibition Matters Little</h2>

<p>In the end, though, prohibition's effects on drug usage are small. Drug
usage is a culturally determined phenomenon, mainly out of the realm of
government policy.</p>

<p>Marijuana laws vary considerably across the U.S. and across <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>. Some
states and countries have strict laws, others have decriminalized or even
legalized personal marijuana use. Yet marijuana use is fairly constant across
the U.S. and across Western Europe.</p>

<p>One of the most frequently cited "arguments" of prohibitionists is that
"England tried legalizing heroin, and the use skyrocketed." What is so amazing
is that prohibitionists, having no real logic to back their claims, are
reduced to deception about an incident clearly favoring legalization.</p>

<p>England did legalize heroin (with a doctor's prescription) -- in the 1920's.
Heroin use did skyrocket -- in the 1960's. If legalization causes increased
drug use, it sure has one hell of a time lag.</p>

<p>What prohibitionists never get around to telling you is that heroin use
skyrocketed <em>even more</em> in the U.S. during the same time period,
despite strict law enforcement efforts. Nor do they say that the British
heroin users had lower overdose rates, less criminal behavior and less
public dependency than users under the U.S.'s prohibitionary regime.</p>

<p>The perennial prohibitionists' solution to their failure is to get
"tougher." In addition to the instances above, history provides numerous
examples of the failure of being "tough." <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China</a> once beheaded opium users and
sold their families into slavery. I cannot imagine a tougher policy, yet opium
use in China continued. Many Muslim countries today hang drug dealers -- and
continue to do so (it hasn't stopped).</p>

<P>As further evidence against the "get tough" argument, prisons still
have high levels of illegal drug use. For example, the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a> governor's office
did a study that found illicit drugs in the bloodstream of 11% - 24% of
Ohio's prison population. If drugs can't be kept out of jail, how can they
be kept out of anywhere else?</p>

<title>Drug Users</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Drug Users</h1>

<p>Drug users are clearly worse off under prohibition than under legalization.
Under prohibition, users have more criminal activity, more health problems
and less opportunity to improve their lives.</p>

<h2>Drug Users Under Prohibition</h2>

<p>Prohibition increases the cost of the drugs made illegal. This causes many
addicts, who otherwise could have supported their habit, to rob and steal, or
go on welfare, to get enough money.</p>

<p>Under prohibition, users must obtain their drugs from criminals, since
organized crime generally ends up distributing illegal substances. Thus,
users associate with violent criminals and are more likely to commit crime
themselves.</p>

<p>Criminal justice scholars have often noted that there is a psychological
barrier to breaking the law. It is much easier for a person to commit a second
crime than a first one. Making drug use illegal puts drug users in the position
of already having broken a law -- often a law with harsher penalties than
violent crimes such as robbery and theft. This makes users more likely to
commit other types of crime.</p>

<p>In the black market, there is little recourse for disputes other than
violence. If a drug seller commits fraud, or otherwise injures a user, the
user's only hope for compensation is violent confrontation. Most "drug murders"
are not the result of drug usage, but disputes over drug deals.</p>

<p>Because illegal drugs are sold on the black market, users cannot be sure of
what they are actually purchasing. In fact, black market drugs are often
tainted ("cut") with other, sometimes harmful, substances. This is the primary
reason overdoses are common under prohibition but rare under legalization.
Users are more at a health risk because drugs are illegal. Drugs' illegality
also tends to make them more concentrated, often a health hazard.</p>

<p>Because drug paraphrenalia is often illegal, intravenous drug users
sometimes share needles, leading to increased rates of diseases including
AIDS.</p>

<p>Users are also worse off under prohibition because companies cannot
perform some drug research, and so are unable to discover less addictive
or less harmful alternatives.</p>

<p>Prohibition discourages users from seeking help. If a user seeks medical
or other forms of help, he runs the risk of being turned over to the
authorities, or of losing access to his drug. Many users are unwilling to
face the struggle of overcoming addiction if those barriers remain.</p>

<p>If a drug user does manage to stay out of criminal activity, and avoid
health hazards, his life may still be destroyed if his drug usage is found
out. Serving even a short prison sentence will disrupt the user's family,
make it harder to find a job, and bring the user into contact with the most
violent criminals.</p>

<h2>Drug Users Under Legalization</h2>

<p>Under legalization, the future is much brighter.</p>

<p>Drug users have ready, inexpensive access to their drug, allowing them to
support their habit even on a slight income. See, for example, the difference
in users who were able to obtain drugs legally through England's <a
href="/revolution/body/drugs/usage/liverpool.html">Liverpool
clinic</a> or through methadone clinics in the U.S.</p>

<p>Under legalization, users buy drugs from stores, never coming into contact
with organized crime. Fraud and labeling laws apply, so users can be sure of
what they are getting, leading to fewer health problems. Disputes are settled
in the courts rather than in the streets.</p>

<p>Drug users will have more choice, and history shows that they will favor
less concentrated (usually less harmful) forms of their drug: beer and wine
instead of liquor, coca tea instead of powder cocaine.</p>

<p>Drug users who seek help will have no barriers to doing so. There will be
no threat of punishment, no penalty for failing.</p>

<h2>Drug Users and Society</h2>

<p>Prohibitionists rely on demonizing drug users and dealers in order to
justify the inhuman treatment proposed for them. In reality, drug users make
many useful contributions to society, even when their personal lives falter.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>American Indians. Many American Indian tribes of the southwest used
peyote, a hallucinogenic cactus, in religious ceremonies. This cultural
practice continues in many tribes today.</p></li>

<li><p>Edgar Allen Poe. Wracked by alcohol and opium abuse for most of his
short adult life, Poe nevertheless earned an esteemed place in literary
history. He invented the modern detective story and defined the horror
story. His works are mandatory reading in many U.S. classrooms.</p></li>

<li><p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge. His most famous poem was written under the
influence of opium. Though an addict, he was able to support his habit legally,
without resort to crime or dependency, and led a productive life.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="/revolution/by_name/E/AlbertEinstein.html">Albert
Einstein</a>. A confirmed tobacco user, the preeminent physicist
is responsible for some of the greatest scientific advances of the
twentieth century. Einstein opposed alcohol Prohibition in the U.S.</p></li>

<li><p>Jack Nicholson. The award-winning actor and director took part in
LSD experiments while the drug was still legal.</p></li>

<li><p>The Beatles. The band that defined sixties rock'n'roll experimented
widely with marijuana and LSD. Their seminal album, <cite>Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band</cite>, was partly inspired by their discovery of
LSD use. The Beatles' members were among a large group of Britons who took
out full-page newspaper ads advocating marijuana legalization.</p></li>

<li><p>Jimi Hendrix. The groundbreaking psychedelic/blues guitarist used
marijuana and LSD, and died after taking (legal) sleeping pills. Despite
his personal problems, he contributed much to American music.</p></li>

<li><p>Hunter S. Thompson. The prototypical "gonzo journalist" was well known
for his excessive drug use.</p></li>

<li><p>John Belushi. The great comedian eventually died of a drug overdose.
Belushi did whatever drugs he could find: marijuana, LSD, cocaine, heroin.
Despite his self-destructive habits (not limited to drugs), Belushi contributed
to American film with such comedic classics as <cite>Animal House</cite> and
<cite>The Blues Brothers</cite>.</p></li>

<li><p>Al Gore. The Vice President admitted to smoking marijuana in college
(including inhaling).</p></li>

<li><p>Bill Clinton. The President admits to smoking marijuana but not to
inhaling it.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Of course there are many more, countless examples of people who led
productive lives in spite of recreational drug use. With over thirty million
users of illegal drugs in the United States alone, it is obvious that drug
users are present in every level of society, including doctors and lawyers,
teachers and politicians.</p>

<title>Drug Sellers</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Drug Sellers</h1>

<p>Drug sellers are a menace under prohibition, but a peaceful contributor
to the economy under legalization.</p>

<h2>Drug Sellers Under Prohibition</h2>

<p>Prohibition provides a major source of income for organized crime. Under
prohibition, drug sellers most likely to succeed are those who can evade
police best and who are most ruthless dealing with competitors. This is
natural territory for organized crime.</p>

<p>Prohibition concentrates drug industry profits. Contrary to popular belief,
the drug industry as a whole is not highly profitable. Instead, profits are
highly concentrated in the most successful sellers. Most drug sellers
barely make enough -- and sometimes not enough -- to support their own
habit. Sellers are constantly being ripped off or killed by other sellers,
when they're not in jail.  The drug industry is not kind to most sellers.</p>

<p>The minority of drug sellers who are successful, however, make spectacular
profits. Their prominent and glamorous example encourages others to try to
emulate them. At most risk are those with few legal alternatives, those who
expect to make around the minimum wage, or be jobless. Prohibition, by
concentrating drug industry profits, tempts many poor teenagers into a
violent life.</p>

<p>Prohibition provides a source of funding for guerilla groups in
hot spots worldwide, including the <a href="triangle.html">Golden Triangle</a>
of southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Drug Sellers Under Legalization</h2>

<p>Under legalization, the drug industry becomes another part of the economy.
Disputes between competitors are settled in court, not in the street.
Organized crime loses its advantage -- and its funding. Profits are evened
out by legal competition, so that drug dealing no longer presents a glamorous
example to struggling youth.</p>

<title>Drugs and the Legal System</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Drugs and the Legal System</h1>

<p>Prohibition leads to overcrowded prisons, overloaded courts, less
enforcement against violent crimes, and corruption at every level of
the legal system.</p>

<p>Criminalizing an activity that so much of the population participates in
can only lead to overcrowded prisons. There are more marijuana users in the
U.S. than there are Catholics. Even doubling or tripling the amount of prison
space would not help imprison more than a slight fraction of drug users.</p>

<p>When prisons fill up, prisoners must be released. In many cases, violent
criminals are let out before nonviolent drug offenders. Plea-bargaining,
suspended sentences and early releases for violent criminals are all a
direct result of increased drug law enforcement.</p>

<p>Similarly, courts are burdened with drug cases. To speed up the process,
courts are forced to deal lightly with violent criminals, through such means as
plea-bargaining.</p>

<p>Police must allocate their limited resources among various law enforcement
efforts. Seizure laws and political pressure ensure that drug enforcement
receives funding at the expense of efforts to stop violent crime.</p>

<p>The amount of money involved in the drug trade leads to corruption at all
levels: police, lawyers, judges, politicians. Police <a href="lying.html">lie
to make drug arrests</a> because actual evidence is hard to come by when
there is no victim to file a complaint.</p>

<title>Benefits of Drugs</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Benefits of Drugs</h1>

<p>Another deleterious effect of drug prohibition is that we lose the
benefits of drugs that are made illegal. Almost every drug that can be
abused, can also be used beneficially for other purposes. Because
prohibition relies on an image of drugs as unmitigated evil, anti-drug
propaganda distorts the true effects -- positive and negative -- of drugs.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="hemp/">Marijuana</a></li>
<li><a href="tobacco/">Tobacco</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Prohibition discourages research into categories of drugs that have
been banned, taking away from us discoveries that might help medicine,
or that might prove to be less harmful alternatives to existing
recreational drugs.</p>

<p>Many illegal drugs have medicinal uses. Alcohol in moderation lessens
the risk of heart disease. Heroin is the only painkiller effective for certain
terminal diseases including cancers. Marijuana can halt the progress of
glaucoma and combat nausea caused by chemotherapy or prescription drugs.
MDMA (Ecstasy) showed promise for treating some psychological problems.
If you are one day afflicted by one of these ailments, do you want your
choices in cures limited by legislative decree?</p>

<title>Drug War Critics</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Critics of Drug Prohibition</h1>

<p>Libertarians have always been foremost among opponents of drug prohibition.
Psychologist <a href="/revolution/by_name/S/ThomasSzasz.html">Thomas Szasz</a>,
economist <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/MiltonFriedman.html">Milton
Friedman</a> and <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html"><cite>Reason</cite>
magazine</a> have all given eloquent arguments in favor of drug freedom.</p>

<p>Libertarians aren't the only ones calling for reform. Many prominent figures
have signed the Hoover Institution's <a href="hoover.html">Hoover
Resolution</a> calling for a national commission to study drug war
alternatives. Among the many people criticizing drug prohibition
are the <a href="sanchez.html">President of Bolivia</a>, the
<a href="bushnell.html">President of the American Bar Association</a>,
the <a href="mutter.html">President of the American Judges Association</a>,
and Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke.</p>

<p>When then-Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders declared drug legalization should
be studied, Republicans and Democrats alike denounced her. The Libertarian
Party issued a <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.bradley.edu/campusorg/libertarian/lpdocs/releases/LPDefendsElders.html">1993
news release</a> supporting her call.</p>

<p>Support for medical use of marijuana has increased dramatically.
In 1994, localities cities passed resolutions supporting medical marijuana,
including <a href="breckenridge.html">Breckenridge, Colorado</a>,
<a href="frisco.html">Frisco, Colorado</a>, and
<a href="alameda.html">Alameda County, California</a>. In 1996, the
states of California and Arizona passed initiatives legalizing
medical marijuana. In 1997, the prestigious New England Journal of
Medicine <a href="jom.html">endorsed medical marijuana</a>.</p>

<h1>Quotes on Drugs and Drug Policy</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Einstein on Prohibition</h2>

<p>The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably
by the Prohibition law. For nothing is more destructive of respect
for the government and the law of the land than passing laws
which cannot be enforced. It is an open secret that the dangerous
increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this.</p>

judgment in all human affairs.</p>

<title>Morality of Drug Policy</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: current -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Morality and Drug Policy</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/ThomasRush.html">Thomas Rush</a>:</p>

<p>If you are interested in my background, here it is.  My mother
raised us in a Christian household -- evangelical, fundamentalist, 
almost 'holy roller,' if that means anything to you.  I believed (of
course!) that drugs should be illegal; after all, they were dangerous.</p>

<p>At some point, though, I remember that I started to believe that you
couldn't make someone go to heaven by controlling their behavior -- people
were saved by what they thought and believed, and their actions and lives
changed to match those beliefs. And so I started to question the laws we
have which try to enforce morality: the laws against drugs, and homosexuality,
and nudity, and prostitution, and a seemingly endless stream of others.</p>

<p>I also started to see some of the information about how prohibition didn't
work -- how alcohol consumption went <em>up</em> (and went down again after
repeal). How the money involved in illegal alcohol provided organized crime
its foothold (in fact, probably, its reason for being). How the murder rate
went up through prohibition and dropped starting soon after repeal. The
tremendous jump in alcohol-related diseases from bathtub gin and
overindulgence that began with the advent of prohibition, and how those
same diseases and their deaths tapered off when alcohol became legal again.</p>

<p>In short, I saw that my earlier views of why we have these laws, and of
their effects, were not consistent with reality. I very definitely remember
reading, at about age twelve, an argument for treating drug addiction as a
health problem, not a legal problem. At that time, I thought the idea was one of
the most ludicrous ever -- these people were criminals!  My views on this
changed as I began to see that there was a difference between what drug
users did to themselves by choice, and illegal things they did to others
to support their habits.</p>

<p>Since then, I have discovered what I find to be the single most damning
piece of evidence against our current drug laws: if we have been unable to keep
illegal drugs out of our prisons, how, then, can we keep illegal drugs out
of a free society?</p>

<p>There is an increasing number of people who support drug legalization, from
a surprisingly broad spectrum of society. They include conservative columnist 
William Safire, the Democratic governor of Baltimore, some Federal judges,
a number of think tanks, and lots of "just plain folks."</p>

<p>Someone once said to me, "Drug addictions destroy lives, often without the
victim's knowledge. A very good friend of mine is addicted to pot. He's been
smoking for several years, always claiming he's not addicted, that it's just
fun, but his life is getting consistently destroyed, and he lacks the ambition
he used to have. His status has gradually gone from upper middle-class to
nearly poor, and he's far from unique."</p>

<p>This brings up two of the things that I think would be just plain silly
about the war on drugs, if they weren't so frightening.  First, that
friend chooses to smoke pot regardless of the laws now in place. How
much more draconian do they need to be made before he'll quit? How
strict a law, how fierce the punishment should we enact to keep someone
from consuming a substance if there is no force or fraud involved in his
decision to consume it?</p>

<p>Second, if he's in bad shape now in his drift from the middle class, just
pray that he doesn't get arrested. There are people, many people, who have
had their lives shattered not because their drug use was out of control,
but because of their arrest for drug use. As long as this is only a
personal problem, he can decide to get medical treatment, and can get
back into the middle class. The moment it becomes a legal problem, and he
is arrested, he'll be lucky if he can ever be whole again.</p>

<p>This person continued, "Many addicts end up on welfare or homeless. They
become dependent invalids, which our society must care for, whether we want
to or not, because poor people will turn to violence for basic necessities
if they are not provided."</p>

<p>This involves several points: 1) Drug addicts have a higher incidence of
homelessness and are more likely to be on welfare than the population as
a whole; 2) Drug addicts become dependent invalids; 3) Our society must
provide for drug addicts; and 4) If society does not provide for drug addicts,
they will turn to violence to keep themselves alive.</p>

<p>My response:</p>

<p>I have no problem with point 1. I think that statistics show that alcohol
abusers are also <em>much</em> more likely to be homeless than the general
population. Does this mean that we should recriminalize alcohol?</p>

<p>Examining the second point shows it to be false. Over fifty million people
in this country have smoked marijuana. Very few of those are dependent on
society for support, or invalids. I agree that some people do become
addicted to illegal drugs (but alcohol has a higher addicition rate than
most illegal drugs, and tobacco has just about, if not <em>the</em>, highest
addiction rate of all), but that is not typical.</p>

<p>I vehemently reject point 3. Our government has decided that we
<em>shall</em> provide for the less-well-off. I do not believe that the
government is either the best, the most effective, or the lowest cost
provider of welfare. In fact, the more we provide for people who have
made irresponsible lifestyle choices, the easier it becomes for them to
be irresponsible. I have a brother-in-law who was going down that path. He
had both drug and alcohol problems. As long as he had someone in his family to
give him a place to sleep and food to eat, he got worse -- more dependent. At
some point, his mother (the last of the supporters) said, "Enough." It was
painful to her, but it was not that long after that he began to turn his
life around.</p>

<p>Many (if not most) of the crime problems around illegal drugs stem from the
artificially high prices charged for them. There's no reason for cocaine to
cost $100 for a very diluted gram. If people could keep their day job and
afford to buy their substances of choice, you'd have a lot less mugging,
burglary, embezzlement, what have you. In answer to point four, if drugs
were again legal, users could work normal jobs and pay for normal amounts
of drug use. If the lesson of prohibition is any guide, there would be
<em>less</em> drug use.  Drug use would tend to the less-concentrated
forms of the drug, and away from the more dangerous and concentrated
(crack, PCP) drugs that are now being sold to increase the ease of
smuggling and distribution.</p>

<p>We could stop locking up people who engage in peaceful business
transactions and hurt only themselves, if anyone.  We could concentrate
on keeping  those in jail who do commit crimes of force or
fraud against others.  Our jails in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> are so filled
with people
who have committed victimless crimes, thanks to the minimum sentence
laws, that violent criminals serve only one month for each year of
their sentence.</p>

<p>I am very concerned that laws need to focus on responsibility.  If
you choose to take a psychoactive substance, you ought to be responsible
for the acts you do while under its influence.</p>

<p>Someone might say, "When someone is addicted to major personality-altering
drugs, it becomes everyone's problem, since the person on the drugs is
different from the one who calmly debates the need for legalization. I know
of two incidents where train crashes were caused because the conductor was
high. In one, he forgot to switch tracks. He was only high on marijuana, but
many people <em>died</em>. It's no longer just his problem. When someone is
actually addicted, they cannot control themselves, so there are high people
operating heavy equipment, putting lives in danger."</p>

<p>The train incidents argue not for drug prohibition, but for 
competence testing.  Those conductors could just as easily been 
impaired because of lack of sleep or a fight with their wife.  The
dangerous act is operating heavy equipment while impaired, not the
way that one got impaired (unless it should be illegal to not get 
enough sleep?).</p>

<p>Someone who sells bungee jumps is statistically more likely to be
killing someone than I, a computer programmer, is.  Someone who
designed race cars up through the sixties and seventies was 
endangering not only the driver of <em>that</em> car, but also the other
drivers and the spectators; should that have been illegal?  I am
concerned here about the difference between an act of choice
(consumption of a psychoactive substance) and an act of endangerment
(putting others at risk by operating equipment while impaired).
If an act doesn't endanger others, what right have we to make
it a criminal act?</p>

<p>If I can leave you with one thought, let it be this:
I feel strongly that responsibility comes from within -- from 
being able to learn from mistakes.  Our government can give no one
a sense of responsibility (no more than it can give one a sense
of patriotism by drafting them). It has never been a good nanny,
no matter how compelling the cause: a free people must be free to
make mistakes with their own property, money, and bodies.</p>

<title>Christian Group Funds Health Care</title>
<!-- Place: USA;
	bills passed in Oklahoma, Kansas, Kentucky and Pennsylvania (USA);
	newsletter based in Barberton, Ohio (USA) -->
<!-- Time: OK bill passed by House April 25, 1994;
	signed by governor April 28, 1994 -->

<h1>Oklahoma Exempts Group From Insurance Regulation</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/">Oklahoma</a> passed
a law, signed by the governor April 28, 1994, exempting
a religious newsletter from insurance regulations, according to a May 2, 1994
report from PRNewswire.</p>

<p>The <cite>Christian Brotherhood Newsletter</cite>, with over 25,000
subscribers nationwide, coordinates contributions
for medical expenses incurred by subscribers. If a member has a need, it is
published in the newsletter, and other subscribers respond with cards, prayers
and monetary gifts to help pay the bills.</p>

<p>The problem is that insurance regulators in Oklahoma and other states see
this as a form of insurance. If the newsletter is forced to comply with
costly insurance regulations, it will go out of business.</p>

<p>Oklahoma State Rep. Jim Dunlap (R) introduced H.B. 2125, exempting
religious organizations from insurance regulation. The bill passed the state
house on a concurrence vote to the state senate version on April 25, and was
signed by the governor April 28.</p>

<p>Similar laws have been passed in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ky/">Kentucky</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ks/">Kansas</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a>.</p>

<p>According to PRNewswire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Oklahoma Insurance Department launched an inquiry into the operation of
the <cite>Newsletter</cite> in June of 1993.  Upon review of documents provided
by the <cite>Newsletter</cite> and a flood of correspondence from Oklahoma
subscribers, Commissioner of Insurance Cathy Weatherford determined in a July
29, 1993 letter to the <cite>Newsletter</cite> that "it appears <cite>Christian
Brotherhood Newsletter</cite> does not meet the definition of insurance found
at 36 O.S. 102."  Ms. Weatherford also suggested at that time to pass
legislation to further clarify the <cite>Newsletter's</cite> status in
Oklahoma.</p>

<p>... House Bill 2125 stipulates that the Oklahoma Insurance Code does not
apply to a non-profit, religious organization that "acts as an organizational
clearinghouse for information between subscribers who have financial,
physical, or medical needs and subscribers who choose to assist with those
needs, matching subscribers with the present ability to pay with subscribers
having a present financial or medical need," as long as the suggested amounts
to give are "voluntary among the subscribers, with no assumption of risk or
promise to pay ..."</p>

<p> In 1993, Newletter subscribers helped each other pay over $27,000,000 of
medical expenses. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The need for such an exemption highlights the fact that regulation drives
up the cost of insurance. If the <cite>Christian Brotherhood Newsletter</cite>
can only operate successfully without regulation, how many private insurance
companies are driven out of the market by such regulation?</p>

<p>Copyright 1994 by <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/MichaelHihn.html">Michael
J. Hihn</a>:</p>

<p>Health care represents 1/7 of our economy, approaching one trillion 
dollars a year.  Of that total, what percent would you say is 
controlled by insurance companies?  In round numbers, 60%, 40%, or 30%?  
Insurance companies are the primary target of health-care reform.  
And, although containing costs is only one goal, we should know how 
much of that goal is being addressed.  What was your answer?</p>

<p>The correct answer is ... less than 15% of national health-care costs 
are paid by private insurers.  And I apologize for the trick question.  
That was for 1990, which you can confirm in the Statistical Abstract 
at your local library.  (I assume you may not believe private insurance 
is so small a factor.)  Insurance companies spent $90 billion of the 
$675 billion total, or 13.3%.</p>

<p>In that same year, government insurance spent nearly twice as much, 
$174 billion, for Medicare/Medicaid alone.  And costs for these 
government plans are increasing nearly twice as fast as private plans.  
That's the first well-kept secret:  government plans dominate the 
health care market, and do the worst at controlling costs.  
But we keep hearing the private sector has failed.  If the auto 
industry is in trouble do we blame the smallest supplier, Chrysler?</p>

<p>In autos as in health care, the largest supplier (GM) is the least 
efficient.  Are Ford and Chrysler customers demanding a takeover by a
less efficient GM?  Or might GM shareholders prefer a takeover by a 
more efficient competitor?  For health care, the evidence suggests 
it's the private sector that should be taking over the government 
plans.  We're doing it backwards.</p>

<p>Here's another well-kept secret:  Three major health-care proposals, 
including the President's, will require higher local taxes for many 
schools and cities.  When I was a school board member at an average-
sized suburban system, we saved tens of thousands of dollars per 
year by self-insuring employee health costs.  We reimbursed expenses 
ourselves, up to a "stop-loss" maximum (high-deductible insurance).  
Self-funding is a proven cost-saver for millions of Americans.  
But the President would make these savings illegal for employers of 
fewer than 1,000.  Do your city and schools self-insure?</p>

<p>In a May 19th <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> op-ed piece, it was reported
that 405,000 small-medium businesses now self-insure their employees.  
Administrative costs average only 6%.  The Independent Grocers 
Association manages a self-funded plan for IGA grocery stores, 
providing coverage for 37,000 families.  But because each store is 
an independent small business, that coverage would be banned.</p>

<p>Self-funding is one way employers have cut costs without sacrificing 
quality.  The other is a major switch to HMO coverage.  From 1980 to 
1992, when insurance rates were skyrocketing, HMO enrollments more 
than quadrupled - from 9.1 million to 37.2 million Americans.  
Both options, self-funding or HMO, provide one-time savings of 30-45% 
from the switch, with future savings from better management.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, employers who provide traditional low-deductible, 
third-party health insurance have failed to control rate increases.  
Instead, those employers shifted more of the burden to workers.</p>

<p>Cost increases are much less in private health plans.  But look 
deeper, and we see two opposing factors.  Traditional plan rates 
are still skyrocketing.  But actual cost <em>reductions</em> are occurring 
in those workplaces, both public and private, that reject or reduce 
traditional coverage.</p>

<p>That's why Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) deserve a closer look.  
MSAs, and how they work, is another well-kept secret.  My family 
already has a restricted MSA, the Flexible Savings Accounts now 
used by millions of Americans.  (Flex accounts are another cost-saver 
the President would repeal.)</p>

<p>Personally, I love a system that eliminates both government and 
insurance bureaucracies.  We have HMO coverage.  Our flex account 
self-reimburses the co-payments (tax free).  We fully self-insure 
(pay cash for) the optical needs of three people, also from the 
tax-free flex account.</p>

<p>Reimbursement is simple, from my wife's employer.  I attach cash 
receipts to a simple form that contains her name, employee number 
and signature.  We get the same tax treatment as employer-paid 
insurance, without paying insurance overhead.  If I could, I'd cancel 
the HMO, buy insurance for only major expenses, pay cash for everything 
else, and let the savings accumulate for our son when we're gone.  
But Congress won't let me.</p>

<p>One proposal, by Senator Phil Gramm, would have your employer place 
your full insurance costs, up to $4,500, into a tax-free MSA.  
It would then be your money.  You could self-insure (pay cash) to 
whatever extent you want, and buy whatever insurance you want ... 
including what you have now.  There's a strong incentive (cash in 
your pocket) to either self-insure or switch to an HMO.  Each year 
you could withdraw up to $1,500 of any savings, as taxable income.</p>

<p>Self-insuring would save the most.  But the Senator may have oversold 
that option, while doing nothing to help you do so.  His critics claim 
most folks are too dumb to shop for insurance.  Are you too dumb?</p>

<p>The critics have a point, though.  If the Senator wants to encourage 
self-insurance (paying cash), he could have made it a lot easier.  
Two simple changes would do that.  First, help more small employers 
to provide self-insured plans, by allowing small-business and trade 
associations to manage them ... like IGA.</p>

<p>For those who want to individually self-insure, Gramm's plan already 
transfers the money to your own account.  Permit banks to offer a 
debit card on MSAs, and we can even eliminate that simple form I 
described.  You'd have two health-care cards.  One for catastrophic 
insurance, which would rarely be used.  Another that automatically 
pays your doctor (or HMO co-pay) from your MSA ... totally eliminating 
their own paperwork.</p>

<p>One card or two?  With one-card plans, we start by repealing proven 
cost-savers, then add a huge new bureaucracy and more insurance 
reimbursements than now.  Add the second card and we slash insurance 
involvement, avoid more government, expand what already works, and give 
you several options to increase your take-home pay.</p>

<p>If we then do likewise with government plans, the savings would pay 
all or most of the costs for universal coverage.  That's the final 
best-kept secret.  The real obstacle to genuine reform is ... partisan 
politics.  It's Democrats who most want universal coverage.  But it's 
Republicans with the best way to pay for it, by cutting costs for the 
currently insured.</p>

<h1>What we <em>don't</em> need is another Medicare</h1>

<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/MichaelHihn.html">Michael J. Hihn</a></p>

<p>The First Lady has dismissed health care opponents as "the same people 
who opposed Medicare."  But Medicare is lurching toward bankruptcy.  
Its opponents were right.</p>

<p>Let's go back to 1965, when Congress passed Medicare and Medicaid.  
Most of the elderly already had health insurance.  The poor were treated 
at city, county and charity hospitals.  The right to emergency treatment, 
regardless of insurance, had been enacted under Eisenhower.  Medical care 
was available to only slightly fewer people than now.  But medical costs 
were less than half today's level -  5.9% of the economy.</p>

<p>Since 1965, health costs have more than doubled, to 14% of GDP, and are 
projected to triple by the year 2000.  Government now pays over 43% of 
all medical costs - and shifts billions more to private insurers.  From 
a 1991 CBO report:  Medicare  underpays hospital average costs by 
12%.  Medicaid underpays hospitals by 12%, and pays doctors 31% less 
than even Medicare rates.  When government underpays, providers shift 
their costs to private insurers and cash customers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clinton never mentions how Medicare shifts costs to private payers.  
Instead, she points to cost-shifting created by unpaid treatment for the 
poor.  But doctor and hospital bills have <em>always</em> recovered the cost of
unpaid treatment.  What's new is cost shifting by government.</p>

<p>From 1985 to 1989, unpaid hospital care grew slightly, from 5.5% to 6.0% 
of billing.  But government underpayment shot from 0.6% to 5.0% -- the 
same years private insurance premiums started skyrocketing.</p>

<p>Obviously, runaway private insurance costs are not caused by cost shifts 
from the uninsured poor. That shift has always existed, as a bad debt, 
and has remained fairly constant.  Excessive medical cost inflation is 
caused by  new and growing shifts from Medicare and Medicaid.  Politicians 
have promised more than they can pay for with taxes.  So they force private 
insurers to pick up the tab.</p>

<p>Eventually, you and I pay anyhow.  One big difference:  if Medicaid and 
Medicare were fully funded by taxes, we could all see government's failures.  
But shift the costs elsewhere, and private insurance looks like the villain.</p>

<p>CBO also reports that 25% of physicians refuse to see Medicaid patients.  
Other doctors are discouraged by hospitals from admitting Medicaid 
subscribers, thus forcing these patients into hospital emergency rooms.</p>

<p>The first lady claims people use costly emergency rooms because they have 
no insurance.  But under Medicaid, even many <em>insured</em> patients must use
the ER.   Then, because Medicaid refuses to pay emergency room prices, 
the difference is made up by private insurers.</p>

<p>Don't blame hospitals.  The more Medicare and Medicaid patients they 
treat, the more they have to increase prices on everyone else.  Then, 
some consumer group will accuse them of price gouging.  And preferred 
provider plans will decertify them.</p>

<p>The market hasn't failed.  Government health care has failed.  Hospitals 
do compete on price.  But their rewards and incentives are distorted by 
government cost shifts.</p>

<p>So far, we've considered only Medicare's hidden costs.  They also hide 
taxes.  You see some Medicare taxes on your pay sub, as part of the 
FICA deduction.  What you don't see is the hefty subsidy to Medicare 
from general revenues - income taxes.   In 1991, that subsidy was $37.6 
billion  - slightly over 8% of all personal income taxes.  That's up 
sharply too, from 3% in 1980.</p>

<p>There's more.  Take the cost shifting from government health insurance.  
Add the subsidy from income tax revenues.  Then throw in last year's 
Medicare tax hike.  With all that, Medicare will still be broke in 6-8 
years.</p>

<p>In 1965, we should have listened to the critics.  In 1994, we still can.</p>

<p>The Clinton health plan, and even some Republican plans, share the same 
fallacy that's now bankrupting Medicare.  They create a subsidized 
entitlement, for a large group of people, most of whom <em>already have
insurance</em>.  According to Martin Feldstein, former chairman of the 
Council of Economic Advisors, even a modest income-based subsidy would 
create a vast new welfare program for 50 million currently-insured 
Americans.</p>

<p>That's overkill.  And it meets the President's favorite definition of 
insanity ... doing the same thing over and over, but expecting the 
outcome to change.</p>

<h1>Forbes' Health Insurance Alternative</h1>

<p>August 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/TFranklinHarrisJr.html">T.
Franklin Harris Jr.</a>, Critic-at-Large, <cite>The Exchange: Culture Reason
Style</cite>:</p>

<p>The Forbes plan gives cash bonuses to employees who do not file health
insurance claims -- that is, to employees to economize, shop 
around, and pay out of pocket for non-catastrophic or routine health care. 
Forbes has saved enough on insurance to more than pay for the bonuses 
they offer. Meanwhile, employees have very high marks for their company's
system.</p>

<title>The British Health Care System</title>

<body>

<h1>The British Health Care System</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/MalcolmHutty.html">Malcolm Hutty</a>:</p>

<p>On February 23, 1994 MTHORNTN@business.auburn.edu wrote: "One need not
recount the atrocities of the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> and <A
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canadian</a> health
care systems to know
that shortages of health care services results in poor health and in many cases
unnecessary deaths."</p>

<p>... but since that's where I live, I will. The situation here proves a few 
basic truths. In a world of finite resources, desirable goods and 
services have to be rationed. This can be done by pricing or by 
establishing long queues. If it is done by pricing, desperately urgent cases 
can jump the queue by paying a premium, having a whip-round amongst 
friends or appealing to charity, institutional or personal. If it is done 
by queues, urgent cases simply die.</p>

<p>If the government assumes responsibility for the health of the nation, 
every death is seen as the fault of the government, because "just another 
million" would have endowed a kidney machine and operator. There is an 
unstoppable pressure to increase funding year on year. A slight slowdown in 
the rate of growth of spending is universally denounced in the media as 
"Draconian cuts". Whenever hospitals are moved to suit demographic 
trends, or unsavoury old Victorian hospitals are replaced with new, 
modern hi-tech ones, the TV news does an expose' on "the ward closures" 
and "the secret story of closing hospitals" with ne'er a word of the new 
ones opening. The perpetual message is "spend more, spend now".</p>

<p>When election time comes around patient histories are used as campaign 
fodder. The scandal of Jennifer's ear dominated the 1992 General 
Election, in which the parents of a 4? year old girl used her failure to 
be treated for an ear infection as material for the Labour TV ads,  
damning Conservative "cuts". Spending on the NHS has actually risen 
every year in real terms under the Conservatives since they took office 
in 1979 (and undoubtable, before that too).</p>

<p>If you can afford it you get private health insurance, and private 
treatment when you need it. But because this doesn't relieve you of one 
penny of your liability to pay taxes towards the NHS, a lot of people 
cannot afford it.</p>

<p>Horror stories of incompetent doctors, negligent hospitals and unapproved 
drugs waiting idle for the bureaucrats to give them their blessing do not 
help; I'm sure you have those stories too. But in a country where 
anything short of criminal negligence is acceptable, where gross 
incompetance leads only to transfer to another region, where the doctor 
gets paid according to the number of patients in his area not the amount 
of work he does, you can imagine that while people say "the NHS is the 
greatest part of the Welfare State and the great success of post-war 
socialism", they also say that the system is in crisis, that it cannot go 
on like this.</p>

<h1>The Canadian Health Care System</h1>

<p>I've lost the author and date of this report on
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada's</a>
national health care system:</p>

<p>In a recent <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite>, a woman described the
horrors of childbirth, without anesthesia -- yet another cutback in Ontario.
Anesthesiologists are becoming rare in the smaller cities, and
now available only during "business hours" even in Toronto.
If you have a baby at night in Toronto -- or in a small town --
be prepared to scream a lot.</p>

<p>The government had announced cancellation of of any epidural
reimbursements in Thunder Bay.</p>

<p>The article did mention that Ontario anethesiologists get only
$100, but failed to observe that this was the likely cause of
the shortage of these <em>specialists</em> in Ontario.</p>

<p>And, it's not just the rich who come to the U.S. for treatment.
Last month's <em>Readers Digest</em> described a retired blue-collar worker
who was forced to sell his house and liquidate his savings, because
he was "too old" to receive a bone marrow transplant in Ontario.</p>

<title>Clinton Immunization Proposal</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: April 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Clinton's Child Immunization Proposal</h1>

<p>THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary<br>
For Immediate Release April 1, 1993<br>
"Comprehensive Child Immunization Act of 1993" FACT SHEET</p>

<p>The President today sent to the Congress the "Comprehensive Child 
Immunization Act of 1993".  This bill is the first legislative 
proposal he has sent to the Congress for consideration and 
enactment.  When enacted, the bill will assure that all children 
in the United States are protected against vaccine-preventable 
infectious diseases by their second birthday.  This legislation 
inaugurates a new collaborative partnership among parents and 
guardians; health care providers; vaccine manufacturers; and 
Federal, State, and local governments to protect our children 
from the deadly onslaught of infectious diseases.</p>

<p>This legislation would:</P>
<ul>
<li><p>beginning in fiscal year 1995, authorize the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services to purchase and provide childhood 
vaccines in quantities sufficient to meet the immunization 
needs of children in the United States;</p>

<li><p>establish a national immunization tracking system, through 
grants to the States to establish State immunization 
registries, to ensure that children receive their scheduled 
immunizations at the earliest appropriate age; </p>

<li><p>ensure that the National Vaccine Injury Compensation 
Program, an essential link in our Nation's immunization 
system, remains operational; and</p>

<li><p>continue vaccine infrastructure enhancements started in my 
economic stimulus program.</p>

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Immunizations represent one of the most cost-effective means of 
disease prevention.  Although Federal support for childhood 
immunization has been in existence since 1962, the full potential 
of immunizations remains to be achieved.  </p>

<p> Approximately 80 percent of vaccine doses should be received 
before the second birthday in order to protect children during 
their most vulnerable periods.  Unfortunately, many children do 
not receive their basic immunizations by that time.  In fact, in 
some inner city areas as few as 10 percent of 2-year olds have 
received a complete series.  This low level of immunizations has 
been reflected in recent years in outbreaks of measles among un-immunized
preschool children.  The resurgence of measles in 1989 
through 1991 afflicted over 55,000 people and cost the country 
$20 million in avoidable hospital costs alone.</p>

<p> In 1982, the recommended vaccine schedule cost $6.69 in the 
public sector and $23.29 in the private sector.  By 1992, the 
total cost for fully immunizing a child was $122.28 in the public 
sector and $244.10 in the private sector.  </p>

<hr>

<h2>Legislative Proposal</h2>

<p>The problem posed by soaring vaccine costs is exacerbated by a 
deteriorated immunization infrastructure.  This legislation 
continues the rebuilding of our capacity to deliver vaccines and 
educate parents started in my economic stimulus package.  With 
this bill, our Nation's vaccine infrastructure will continue to 
be revitalized, including delivery, safety and research capacity, 
patient and vaccine tracking ability, and the community-based 
outreach and information campaign.</p>

<p> To remove the financial barriers to immunization that impede 
children from being vaccinated on time, and to facilitate 
development of a national tracking system, we must begin Federal 
purchase of all vaccines recommended for universal use in children.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Universal Vaccine Purchase and Provision</h2>

<p> The bill would require that the Secretary consult with other 
Federal agencies for advice on the quantities of recommended 
childhood vaccine to be purchased.  It would authorize the 
Secretary to consult with representatives of State governments, 
experts in vaccine delivery, health care providers, and other 
experts prior to commencing negotiations for the purchase of vaccine.  </p>

<p> This proposal would direct the Secretary to negotiate a 
reasonable price with manufacturers participating in a 
procurement.  The price would be based on data supplied to the 
Secretary by manufacturers regarding (1) costs related to 
research and development, production, distribution to States and 
health care providers, and marketing; (2) profit levels 
sufficient to encourage future investment in research and 
development; and (3) the ability to maintain adequate outbreak 
control.  In addition, the bill would require that data provided 
to the Secretary be treated as a trade secret or confidential 
information for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act and 
would provide criminal sanctions for violations of this provision.</p>

<p> Under this legislation, the Secretary would provide (either 
directly or through the States) for the free distribution of 
vaccines to health care providers who serve children and are 
located in a State that participates in the State registry grant 
program.  In non-participating States, free vaccine will be 
distributed to Federal health care providers, community health 
centers, migrant health centers, health centers serving residents 
of public housing or the homeless, other federally qualified 
health centers, and health care providers serving Indians 
pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination Act or section 503 of 
the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.</p>

<p> Under the Act, health care providers could not charge patients 
for the cost of the vaccine, but may impose a fee for its 
administration unless such a fee would result in the denial of a 
vaccine to someone unable to pay.</p>

<p> Finally, the bill provides that the authority of the Secretary 
established under this legislation to purchase and provide 
vaccines shall cease to be in effect beginning on such date as 
may be specified in a Federal law providing for immunization 
services for all children as part of a broad-based reform of the 
national health care system.</p>

<hr>

<h2>State Immunization Registries</h2>

<p> The bill provides for a collaborative Federal and State effort to 
track the immunization status of the Nation's children.  It 
authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States to establish 
and operate State immunization registries containing specific 
information for each child in the State.  Entering infant birth 
data into registries will enable the identification of children 
who need vaccinations and will help parents and providers assure 
that children are appropriately immunized.  </p>

<p> Providers would be required to report to the State tracking 
registry (or to the Secretary if there is no State registry) 
information regarding each vaccine administered and their 
periodic estimates of the future vaccine needs.  For each child, 
information will be gathered on immunization history, including 
types and lot numbers of vaccines received, health care provider 
identifiers, and adverse reactions associated with the 
immunizations.  In addition, the State immunization registries 
will provide vital information on safety and efficacy of vaccines 
by linking administrative records with adverse reactions 
reporting and disease outbreak patterns.  </p>

<hr>

<h2>The National Vaccine Compensation Program</h2>

<p> A keystone to the Nation's vaccine immunization effort is the 
National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.  This proposal 
would amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow payments from the 
Trust Fund for compensable injuries from vaccines administered on 
or after October 1, 1992.  It would authorize appropriations from 
the Trust Fund for years after fiscal year 1992 for 
administrative costs to carry out the National Vaccine Injury 
Compensation Program.  In addition, it would provide for a 
permanent extension and reinstatement of the vaccine excise tax 
and repeal the Internal Revenue Code provision that authorizes 
the Secretary of the Treasury to terminate the vaccine excise tax.</p>

<p> Other provisions related to the National Vaccine Injury 
Compensation program state that any vaccine recommended for 
universal administration to children by the Secretary would be 
included on the Vaccine Injury Table.  The bill would provide the 
Secretary authority, with respect to any vaccine so added, to 
modify the Table, but only in accordance with notice, hearing, 
and comment procedures, and other limitations.  The chief special 
master would be allowed to suspend proceedings on petitions from 
retrospective claims for up to 30 months, rather than the 540 
days (or 18 months) in current law.  </p>

<p> Finally, vaccine information materials would be simplified by 
replacing the detailed list of items that must be addressed in 
the information materials with a requirement for a concise and 
understandable statement of the benefits and risks of the 
vaccine, and the availability of the National Vaccine Injury 
Compensation Program.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p> For the purpose of making State registry grants, the bill would 
authorize appropriations of $152 million for fiscal year 1995, 
$125 million for fiscal year 1996, and $35 million for each of 
the fiscal years 1997, 1998, and 1999.  In addition, the bill 
would authorize appropriations of such sums as may be necessary 
for fiscal years 1993 and 1994 for start up costs associated with 
activities to implement the "Comprehensive Child Immunization Act 
of 1993."  </p>

<p> Beginning in fiscal year 1995, the bill would authorize the 
Secretary to carry out the program of vaccine purchase and 
distribution from the Comprehensive Child Immunization Account in 
the United States Treasury.  The sources of revenue that will be 
deposited into the Comprehensive Child Immunization Account for 
the vaccine purchase and distribution program will be identified 
in legislation for broad-based reform of the national health care 
system when it is submitted to the Congress by the President in May.</p>

<title>Rothbard's Criticism of the Clinton Plan</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Criticism of Clinton's Health Care Plan</h1>

<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/MurrayRothbard.html">Murray N.
Rothbard</a></p>

<p>The standard media cliche about the Clinton health plan is that God, or the
Devil, depending on your point of view, "is in the details." There is
surprising agreement among both the supporters and all too many of the
critics of the Clinton health "reform." The supporters say that the general
principles of the plan are wonderful, but that there are a few problems in
the details: e.g., how much will it cost, how exactly will it be financed,
will small business get a sufficient subsidy to offset its higher costs, and
on into the night.</p>

<p>The alleged critics of the Clinton Plan also hasten to assure us that they
too accept the general principles, but that there are lots of problems in the
details. Often the critics will present their own alternative plans, only
slightly less complex than the Clinton scheme, accompanied by assertions that
their plans are less coercive, less costly, and less socialistic than the
Clinton effort. And since health care constitutes about one-seventh of the
American output, there are enough details and variants to keep a host of
policy wonks going for the rest of the their lives. </p>

<p> But the details of the Clintonian plan, however diabolic, are merely petty
demons compared to the general principles, where Lucifer really lurks. By
accepting the principles, and fighting over the details, the Loyal Opposition
only succeeds in giving away the store, and doing so before the debate over
the details can even get under way. Lost in an eye-glazing thicket of
minutiae, the conservative critics of Clintonian reform, by being
"responsible" and working within the paradigm set by The Enemy, are
performing a vital service for the Clintonians in snuffing out any clear-cut
opposition to Clinton's Great Leap Forward into health collectivism. </p>

<p> Let us examine some of the Mephistophelean general principles in the
Clintonian reform, seconded by the conservative critics.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Guaranteed universal access. There has been a lot of talk recently about
"universal access" to this or that good or service. Many "libertarian" or
"free-market" proponents of education "reform," for example, advocate
tax-supported voucher schemes to provide "access" to private schooling. But
there is one simple entity, in any sort of free society, that provides
"universal access" to every conceivable good or service, and not just to
health or education or food. That entity is not a voucher or a Clintonian ID
card; it's called a "dollar." Dollars not only provide universal access to
all goods and services, they provide it to each dollar-holder for each
product only to the extent that the dollar-holder desires. Every other
artificial accessor, be it voucher or health card or food stamp, is despotic
and coercive, mulcts the taxpayer, is inefficient and egalitarian.</p>

<li><p>Coercive. "Guaranteed universal access" can only be provided by the
robbery of taxation, and the essence of this extortion is not changed by
calling these taxes "fees," "premiums," or "contributions." A tax by any
other named smells as rotten, and has similar consequences, even if only
"employers" are forced to pay the higher "premiums."</p>

<p> Furthermore, for anyone to be "guaranteed" access to anything, he has to be
forced to participate, both in receiving its "benefits" and in paying for
them. Hence, "guaranteed universal access" means coercing not only taxpayers,
but everyone as participants and contributors. All the weeping and wailing
about the 37 million "uninsured" glosses over the fact that most of these
uninsured have a made a rational decision that they don't want to be
"insured," that they are willing to take the chance of paying market prices
should health care become necessary. But they will not be permitted to remain
free of the "benefits" of insurance; their participation will become
compulsory. We will all become health draftees. </p>

<li><p>Egalitarian. Universal means egalitarian. For the dread egalitarian theme
of "fairness" enters immediately into the equation. Once government becomes
the boss of all health, under the Clinton plan or the Loyal Opposition, then
it seems "unfair" for the rich to enjoy better medical care than the lowest
bum. This "fairness" ploy is considered self-evident and never subject to
criticism. Why is "the two-tier" health system (actually it has been
multi-tier) any more "unfair" than the multi-tier system for clothing or food
or transportation? So far at least, most people don't consider it unfair that
some people can afford to dine at The Four Seasons and vacation at Martha's
Vineyard, whereas others have to rest content with McDonald's and staying
home. Why is medical care any different? </p>

<p> And yet, one of the major thrusts of the Clinton Plan is to reduce us all to
"one-tier," egalitarian health care status.</p>

<li><p>Collectivist. To insure equality for one and all, medical care will be
collectivist, under close supervision of the federal Health Care Board, with
health provision and insurance dragooned by government into regional
collectives and alliances. The private practice of medicine will be
essentially driven out, so that these collectives and HMOs will be the only
option for the consumer. Even though the Clintonians try to assure Americans
that they can still "choose their own doctor," in practice this will be
increasingly impossible. </p>

<li><p>Price Controls. Since it is fairly well known that price controls have
never worked, that they have always been a disaster, the Clinton
Administration always keen on semantic trickery, have stoutly denied that any
price controls are contemplated. But the network of severe price controls
will be all too evident and painful, even if they wear the mask of "premium
caps," "cost caps," or "spending control." They will have to be there, for it
is the promise of "cost control" that permits the Clintonians to make the
outrageous claim that taxes will hardly go up at all. (Except, of course, on
employers.)  Tight spending control will be enforced by the government,
not merely on its own, but particularly on private spending. </p>

<p> One of the most chilling aspects of the Clinton plan is that any attempt by
us consumers to get around these price controls, e.g. to pay higher than
controlled prices to doctors in private practice, will be criminalized. Thus,
the Clinton Plan states that "A provider may not charge or collect from the
patient a fee in excess of the fee schedule adopted by an alliance," and
criminal penalties will be imposed for "payment of bribes or gratuities"
(i.e. "black market prices") to "influence the delivery of health service." </p>

<p> In arguing for their plan, by the way, the Clintonians have added insult to
injury by employing absurd nonsense in the form of argument. Their main
argument for the plan is that health care is "too costly," and that thesis
rests on the fact that health care spending, over recent years, has risen
considerably as a percentage of the GDP. But a spending rise is scarcely the
same as a cost increase; if it were, then I could easily argue that, since
the percentage of GDP spent on computers has risen wildly in the past ten
years, that "computer costs" are therefore excessive, and severe price
controls, caps, and spending controls must be imposed promptly on consumer
and business purchases of computers. </p>

<li><p>Medical Rationing. Severe price and spending controls means, of course,
that medical care will have to be strictly rationed, especially since these
controls and caps come at the same time that universal and equal care is
being "guaranteed." Socialists, indeed, always love rationing, since it gives
the bureaucrats power over the people and makes for coercive egalitarianism.</p>

<p> And so this means that the government, and its medical bureaucrats and
underlings, will decide who gets what service. Medical totalitarianism, if
not the rest of us, will be alive and well in America.</p>

<li><p>The Annoying Consumer. We have to remember a crucial point about
government as against business operations on the market. Businesses are
always eager for consumers to buy their product or service. On the free
market, the consumer is king or queen and the "providers" are always trying
to make profits and gain customers by serving them well. But when government
operates a service, the consumer is transmuted into a pain-in-the-neck, a
"wasteful" user-up of scarce social resources. Whereas the free market is a
peaceful cooperative place where everyone benefits and no one loses, when
government supplies the product or service, every consumer is treated as
using a resource only at the expense of his fellow-men. The "public service"
arena, and not the free market, is the dog-eat-dog jungle. </p>

<p> So there we have the Clintonian health future: government as totalitarian
rationer of health care, grudgingly doling out care on the lowest possible
level equally to all, and treating each "client" as a wasteful pest. And
if, God forbid, you have a serious health problem, or are elderly, or your
treatment requires more scarce resources than the Health Care Board deems
proper, well then Big Brother or Big Sister Rationer in Washington will
decided, in the best interests of "society," of course, to give you the
Kevorkian treatment. </p>

<li><p>The Great Leap Forward. There are many other ludicrous though almost
universally accepted aspects of the Clinton Plan, from the gross perversion
of the concept of "insurance" to the imbecilic view that an enormous
expansion of government control will somehow eliminate the need for filling
out health forms. But suffice it to stress the most vital point: the plan
consists of one more Great Leap Forward into collectivism.</p>

<p> The point was put very well, albeit admiringly, by David Lauter in the Los
Angeles Times (September 23). Every once in a while, said Lauter, "the
government collectively braces itself, takes a deep breath and leaps into a
largely unknown future." The first American leap was the New Deal in the
1930s, leaping into Social Security and extensive federal regulation of the
economy. The second leap was the civil rights revolution of the 1960s. And
now, writes Lauter, "another new President has proposed a sweeping plan" and
we have been hearing again "the noises of a political system warming up once
again for the big jump."</p>

<p> The only important point Mr. Lauter omits is leaping into what? Wittingly or
unwittingly, his "leap" metaphor rings true, for it recalls the Great Leap
Forward of Mao's worst surge into extreme Communism.</p>

<p> The Clinton health plan is not "reform" and it doesn't meet a "crisis." Cut
through the fake semantics, and what we have is another Great Leap Forward
into socialism. While
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russia</a> and the former
Communist states are struggling
to get out of socialism and the disaster of their "guaranteed universal
health care" (check their vital statistics), Clinton and his bizarre Brain
Trust of aging leftist grad students are proposing to wreck our economy, our
freedom, and what has been, for all of the ills imposed by previous
government intervention, the best medical system on earth. </p>

</ol>

<p>That is why the Clinton health plan must be fought against root and branch,
why Satan is in the general principles, and why the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/L/Mises.html">Ludwig von Mises
Institute</a>, instead of offering its own 500-page health plan, sticks to its
principled "four-step" plan laid out by Mises Institute Senior Fellow
Hans-Hermann Hoppe (<cite>The Free Market</cite> April 1993) of dismantling
existing government intervention into health. </p>

<title>Health Supplements</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->

<body>

<h1>Health Supplements</h1>

<p>Open Letter to the President</p>

<p>Dear President Clinton:</p>

<p>I urge you to actively support and lobby Congress to pass The
Supplement Health and Education Act of 1993. which provides necessary
definitions and direction for the FDA, introduced as bicameral, bipartisan
legislation by by Congressman Bill Richardson (H.R. 1709) and Senator Orrin
Hatch (S.784). Under the Bush Administration the FDA substantially expanded
its scope of operation by misapplying the thirty-five year old amendment to
the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) passed by Congress to regulate and
ensure the safety of new chemical additives which were entering the market,
to substances which have been traditionally recognized as food or food
supplements.  I believe that the FDA's action warrants specific direction by
Congress. Please lobby Congress to see that these bills are passed.</p>

<p>For example, the FDA seized two barrels of black currant oil (BCO), claiming
it was a food additive because it had been placed in gelatin capsules.
U.S. District Court for the Central District of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a> denied the
FDA's attempt to dispose of the case without trial on April 10, 1991,
and found in favor of Traco Labs, on the grounds that the FDA had failed
to make its case, and stated that simply adding BCO to gelatin capsules
did not make BCO a food additive.  In November the court dismissed the
FDA's case because the FDA had nothing further to add to its position.</p>

<p>The FDA appealed the decision on October 21, 1992 to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.  In its judgment, rendered
January 27, 1993, the appeals court affirmed the lower court decision
and found in favor of Traco.  Writing for the court, Judge Cudahy stated
that "the Act (FDCA) distinguishes between food additives and food in the
generic sense, this distinction being critical ... The FDA's food additive
definition is so broad, however, that it would blur this distinction.
It would classify every component of food -- even single active
ingredients -- as food additives.  Thus, it would seem, even the addition
of water to food would make the food a food additive.  The only
justification for this Alice-in-Wonderland approach is to allow the
FDA to make an end-run around the statutory scheme..."</p>

<p>The court decision stated:  "The FDA's interpretation would also
arbitrarily classify a substance as either a food or a food additive by
how it is marketed rather than by the nature and use of the substance
itself. The FDA concedes that BCO marketed in bottles instead of capsule
form is not a food additive...  How a product is marketed is not a rational
way of determining whether a substance is a food additive."</p>

<p>An identical case was won in the First Circuit Court of Appeals on
March 3, 1993.  Leslie Kux, the FDA's Associate Chief Counsel for
Enforcement declined comment saying, "the Black Currant Oil cases are
still in litigation.  Suffice it to say that we believe that our legal
position is a sound one."</p>

<p>Even as a layman, it would seem that this legal position is ridiculous.
The FDA regulations, do, as Judge Cudahy suggested, treat herbal teas
as food additives arguing that the addition of an herb to hot water
constitutes food additive status for that herb, while at the same time
regulating true food additives that may be mixed into that herb.  It
should be obvious that the FDA needs further direction from Congress
in determining what a food additive is and what constitutes nutritional
substances.</p>

<p>I believe that the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1993,
is necessary, if for no other reason than to stop the FDA from wasting
valuable tax funds when it has more immediate budget concerns in meeting
its primary function of quality and safety assurance.  I also believe
that an investigation of the FDA's reasons for pursuing such ridiculous
cases in an already over-burdened court system is called for by Congress.
I strongly urge you to support the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act of 1993.</p>

<h1>The Food and Drug Administration</h1>

<p>"FEEL A HEART ATTACK COMING? GO TO FRANCE" by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/V/AlexanderVolokh.html">Alexander Volokh</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/C/CEI.html">CEI</a>
policy analyst; appeared in the August 2, 1994 <cite>The Wall Street
Journal</cite>:</p>

<p>Imagine that you've had a heart attack.  Amid the wails of sirens and
the flash of red lights, paramedics are rushing to help you.  Skilled in
the art of CPR, they remove your shirt and prepare to revive you.  But
much to their surprise -- and yours -- a sign about your neck reads, "Do
not resuscitate." </p>

<p> The real shocker is that, unbeknownst to you, this sign was placed
there by the Food and Drug Administration.  In April 1993, the FDA blocked
testing of the cardiopump, a new cardiopulmonary resuscitation device for
heart-attack victims.  As a result of FDA policy, thousands of people with
heart disease are literally being protected to death. </p>

<p> The cardiopump, manufactured by Ambu International of Denmark, is a
modest device.  It weighs a mere pound and a half and looks like a
modified toilet plunger, with a pliable cup that fits onto the
heart-attack victim's chest and a combination hand- grip/pressure gauge
instead of the wooden handle.  Manual CPR exerts downward pressure on the
chest, but the chest has to re- expand naturally.  The cardiopump can
apply pressure in both directions.  Says Dr. Jeffrey Shultz of the
University of Minnesota: "It turns the chest into a bellows.  It allows
you to pull blood back into the heart and air back into the lungs." </p>

<p> Just how effective is the cardiopump?  In St. Paul, Minn., where
tests were carried out, 54% more patients survived long enough to be
admitted to intensive care if they were given cardiopump-assisted CPR, and
35% more survived to be discharged from the hospital.  (Because of small
sample size, the hospital discharge statistics aren't statistically
significant.)</p>

<p> U.S. tests for the cardiopump began in 1992 and continued until April
1993, when FDA barred further use of the pumps.  According to FDA
spokeswoman Sharon Snider, "This product is considered to be a
'significant risk device,' and informed consent is required for any trials
of significant risk devices." </p>

<p> The FDA's view is shared by virtually no one.  None of the
institutional review boards at the 12 medical institutions where the tests
had been carried out called the cardiopump a "significant risk device." 
More important, the cardiopump is already in use around the world --
Austria and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/France/">France</a> (where it is standard
in physician-manned ambulances), England, Germany, Sweden, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada</a>, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Oceania/Australia/">Australia</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a> and Chile, among
others.  The FDA, in its treatment of the pump, stands alone. </p>

<p> The concepts of "significant risk" and "informed consent" may well be
important, but their relevance here is highly questionable.  "Significant
risk" is meaningless unless you compare the risk of the device with the
risk of <em>not</em> using it.  The survival statistics of manual CPR are
dismal. About one million people have cardiac arrests every year in the U.S.,
and an estimated 700,000 are given CPR.  About 680,000 of these 700,000 do not
survive to leave the hospital.  If the FDA had jurisdiction over manual
CPR, it might well prohibit it on the same grounds. </p>

<p> As for informed consent, keep in mind that these are patients whose
hearts have literally stopped beating.  "You're talking about a
life-or-death situation where our current therapy is nearly hopeless,"
explains Dr. Joseph P. Ornato, chairman of the American Heart
Association's emergency cardiac care committee.  "The reality is, there is
no reasonable means to get informed consent." </p>

<p> The issue of informed consent for unconscious patients may be a
complex question in some cases.  This, however, is not one of them.  The
cardiopump is hardly experimental.  In France, the average approval time
for a medical device is a year and a half; the cardiopump was approved in
March 1993 after just nine weeks.  But the FDA has been of little help,
aside from vaguely offering to "work with the company" in devising
acceptable test procedures.  It will take years just to produce studies
with enough "informed consent" patients to satisfy the FDA. </p>

<p> The world-wide medical community is somewhat nonplussed by the U.S.
government's attitude toward medical technology.  The feeling is
widespread that the Americans are shooting themselves in the foot by
making it so difficult for new drugs and devices to reach the market.  As
Dr. William Grace of St. Vincent's Hospital in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a> put it: "We are a
Third World nation when it comes to the development of ... drugs for people
with life-threatening diseases." </p>

<p> Keith Lurie, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota
who helped develop the cardiopump, estimates that the device will increase
one's chances of survival by about 10-50%.  That kind of improvement "has
not been reported since the first description of manual CPR more than
three decades ago."  Since 20,000 CPR patients a year survive to leave the
hospital, even a 10% increase would mean 2,000 extra lives saved.  In the
St. Paul trial, the increase was 35%, which extrapolates nationally to
7,000 lives, or roughly 20 a day. </p>

<p> Yet strange as the FDA's actions might seem from a medical
standpoint, they are perfectly understandable politically.  If the FDA
mistakenly approves a device that has adverse side effects, this would
result in highly undesirable publicity.  On the other hand, if the FDA
delays in approving a life-saving device, the people who die are
politically invisible.  For a regulator, it's easy to err on the side of
overcaution, even when the results are deadly. </p>

<p> The irony is that we applaud FDA approvals when we should really be
asking why we had to wait so long.  In 1987, when FDA approved
streptokinase, the first drug that could be intravenously administered to
reopen the blocked coronary arteries of heart-attack victims, it was
estimated that the drug could have saved 22,000 lives in the two years
between the filing of the new drug application and the approval.  But
these deaths received less media attention than the deaths of five
patients last year during a test of the hepatitis B vaccine fialuridine. </p>

<p> Now Congress is considering charging device manufacturers "user fees"
of up to $50,000 per new-product application; FDA Commissioner David
Kessler calls this the solution to FDA's backlog problem.  But backlog
isn't the problem.  No amount of staff and funding increases can erase the
bureaucratic incentive to impose restrictions as illogical as informed
consent from patients with no pulse. </p>

</ul>

<h2><a name=clinton>The Clinton Plan</a></h2>

<p>At the heart of President Clinton's proposals for health
care reform is a concept known as "managed competition."
The concept is the brain child of the "Jackson
Hole Group," an ad hoc coalition of health care executives and
academic specialists, led by Dr. Paul Elwood <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p> As envisioned under the President's proposals, each state would
establish one or more Health Alliances, which would act as
collective purchasing agents on behalf of employers and individuals <a
href="#fn2">[2]</a>.
All Americans would be enrolled in a Health Alliance, either
through their employer or individually <a href="#fn3">[3]</a>.  The Alliance
would negotiate with certified health Plans for a benefits package on
behalf of its members, operating much like German sickness
funds <a href="#fn4">[4]</a>.  The government would establish a Guaranteed
National Benefits Package, effectively determining what benefits will and
will not be included in any policies offered. Ultimately, individuals
would be able to choose from three government-defined insurance plans.
The lowest cost of these would be a managed care
plan. Traditional fee-for-service plans, which allow a full choice
of physicians, may be available, but would be much higher priced.
Certified health plans partnerships would be required to community
rate all members of the Alliance and to guarantee coverage
to all Alliance members. Every American will receive a "health
security card" as a symbol of his now guaranteed health coverage <a
href="#fn5">[5]</a>.</p>

<p> Employers would be required to provide coverage for all employees,
both full-time and part-time. Employers must pay at least
80% of the cost of coverage, with the employee paying 20%. The
employer's premium payment would be capped at 7.9% of an
employee's wages for most businesses. However, some very
small businesses could have their premiums capped at 3.9% of
wages. Nonemployed people with incomes and the self-employed
would also have to pay a tax. The federal government
would subsidize insurance purchases by those not covered
through an employer and unable to pay the full insurance cost
themselves <a href="#fn6">[6]</a>.</p>

<p> Public programs, such as Medicaid, would have the option of
purchasing care through an Alliance <a href="#fn7">[7]</a>.</p>

<p> A global budget would be established and premium caps would
be imposed on the certified health plans, in the hopes of using
them to indirectly impose price restraints on hospitals and
physicians.</p>

<p> The program would be overseen by a new federal agency, The
National Health Board. This would be an independent agency,
"similar to the SEC," removed from day-to-day oversight by
Congress or the Executive Branch, with broad powers, including
"stand-by" authority to impose more direct price controls.</p>

<p> However, as legal economist Richard Epstein has noted, "[Managed
Competition] is not so much a coherent government plan
as an oxymoron. It is possible to have either managed health care
or to have open competition in health care services. It is not
possible to have both simultaneously."<a href="#fn8">[8]</a> As proposed,
managed competition appears to offer a great deal of management and
very little competition. Often discussed as a compromise between
various health care reform proposals, managed competition
borrows many of the worst elements of other proposals.</p>

<p> As Alain Enthoven, one of the leading proponents of managed
competition admits, it is not "a free market system." <a href="#fn9">[9]</a> He
is certainly correct about that.</p>

<p> First, the mandate that employers provide health benefits for all
full-time employees will cost jobs. The Jackson Hole Group
admits that "employer mandates are a form of employment
tax."<a href="#fn10">[10]</a>  They claim, however, that their explicit taxes
would be "fairer" than the current system of allocating costs. But, the real
result of such a tax increase is likely to be lost jobs.</p>

<p> The amount of compensation each worker receives for his or her
work is directly related to that worker's productivity. Mandating
an increase in that compensation by requiring the employer to
provide health insurance does nothing to increase productivity.
Thus one of two things happens: either 1) consumers must pay
higher prices for products; or 2) more likely in a competitive
economy, employers will be forced to reduce their payroll costs
to offset these new and increased costs of health benefits. Payroll
reductions may take several forms. One is a reduction in cash
compensation, which in practice is unlikely. More probable is a
reduction in the number of employees, either through layoffs or
by postponing the hiring of new workers.  In either case,
unemployment increases, especially among low-skilled workers
for whom mandated health benefits constitutes a relatively large
increase in employee compensation <a href="#fn11">[11]</a>.</p>

<p> The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), which
represents more than 500,000 small businesses in all 50 states,
surveyed its members and found that 23% would be forced to lay-off
employees if an employer mandate imposed an additional
cost of only $100 per employee per month. Nearly 22%
indicated that they could be forced out of business altogether <a
href="#fn12">[12]</a>.</p>

<p> Indeed, a March 1992 study by the Joint Economic Committee
of Congress estimated that more than 1.2 million jobs would be
lost within one year of enactment of federally mandated health
insurance. Other economists have placed the estimate of jobs lost
at between 630,000 and 3.5 million <a href="#fn13">[13]</a>.</p>

<p> There is a particular unfairness to such a mandate. While most
individuals without health insurance are the working poor,
studies show that 25% of the uninsured have incomes greater
than 300% of the poverty level <a href="#fn14">[14]</a>. These are frequently
young, healthy individuals who have chosen not to purchase health
insurance, preferring to spend their discretionary income elsewhere.
Under an employer mandate, low-skilled, poor people
would lose their jobs to provide these relatively affluent individuals
with government-funded health insurance.</p>

<p> Second, the proposal creates a huge new bureaucracy, the
National Health Board, as well as mini-bureaucracies at the state
level in the Health Alliances. While the proposal fails to offer any
real estimate of the cost of these agencies, those costs can be
assumed to be substantial.</p>

<p> Third, the call for a guaranteed National Benefits Package simply
moves the problems of mandated insurance benefits from the
states to the federal level. Inclusion in the mandated benefits
package is much more likely to be based on the relative lobbying
strength of various provider groups than on a rational view of
medical necessity.  Already the scramble is beginning with women's
groups demanding coverage for abortion and more frequent
mammograms,<a href="#fn15">[15]</a> disputes over the extent of mental health
coverage, etc. <a href="#fn16">[16]</a> Whatever benefits are mandated will
increase the cost of insurance.  And, consumers will be deprived of the ability
to make individual choices on the type of benefits they wish to purchase.</p>

<p> Fourth, requirements for guaranteed issue and community rating
will increase the cost of insurance. Insurance is a business of risk
allocation, in which the insurer receives payment in exchange for
agreeing to cover the expense of certain risks. The cost and
scope of coverage is determined by morbidity/mortality statistical
analysis <a href="#fn17">[17]</a>.  To the degree that insurers are prevented
from basing their contracts on such actuarial values, other policyholders
will be forced to absorb the additional costs.</p>

<p> The whole theory underlying community rating is essentially a
flawed one that healthy people and sick people should pay the
same for insurance. Since sick people inevitably require greater
benefits, the cost of insuring them must be subsidized by healthy
people. Thus, in order to provide coverage for a person with
AIDS, a person without AIDS must pay a higher premium.
Moreover, the additional costs are highly regressive in nature,
forcing the highest marginal costs on those least able to afford the
increase. For example, if community rating causes the premiums
for a famity policy to increase by $1,000, that's a 10% surcharge
for a family earning only $10,000 per year, but only a 1%
surcharge for a family earning $100,000 <a href="#fn18">[18]</a>.  The
subsidization is also regressive because those low-risk persons, who will see
their premiums increase, tend to be young with lower incomes, while
high-risk persons, who will be subsidized, tend to be older and
have higher incomes.</p>

<p> Finally, we should recognize that community rating relieves
individuals of the responsibility for unhealthy lifestyles. There is
no question that individuals who smoke, drink, use drugs,
practice unsafe sex, have poor diets and fail to exercise have far
higher health costs than individuals with healthy lifestyles. In fact,
the top ten causes of death in the United States are all lifestyle
related <a href="#fn19">[19]</a>.  But, by spreading the cost over the entire
population, community rating and guaranteed issue "socialize" the costs in
the truest sense of the word.</p>

<p> Perhaps nothing better illustrates the failures of community
rating than recent events in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a>. On April
1, 1993, New
York began to enforce the nation's most stringent community
rating and guaranteed issue requirements <a href="#fn20">[20]</a>. The result
has been astronomical increases in insurance premiums, in some cases
doubling and tripling rates. The average premium for a 30 year-old
male will increase from $1,200 per year to $3,240, a 170
percent hike. A family policy for a 30 year-old will jump 91
percent, from $4,020 to $7,680, well beyond the reach of most
lower- and middle-income families. Of course some will benefit
under New York's plan. The elderly will see a reduction in their
premiums of nearly 50 percent <a href="#fn21">[21]</a>.</p>

<p> Fifth, the Clinton plan will severely limit consumer choice --
choice of insurer, choice of benefits, and choice of physician.
Numerous studies have shown that Americans do not like
restrictive managed care plans that limit their choice of physicians <a
href="#fn22">[22]</a>.
Because the cap on premiums, community rating and
other restrictions in the President's plan generally prevents
insurers from competing on the basis of their ability to price and
manage risk, most traditional insurers would be driven out of the
market. The criteria established for certified health Plans essentially
limits the market to "the Blues" -- Blue Cross and Blue
Shield -- and a handful of large HMO's <a href="#fn23">[23]</a>.  Thus, the
support for the Clinton health plan by these insurers.</p>

<p> The Clinton plan also holds the potential of severely disrupting the
traditional doctor-patient relationship. Managed competition
changes insurers from "financial intermediaries with expertise in
underwriting risks" to "health care delivery systems ... organizing,
managing and purchasing medical care." <a href="#fn24">[24]</a>  In short,
advocates of managed competition believe physicians should be responsible to
insurers, rather than the patient. This means that patient choice of
physician should be limited to give the insurer increased bargaining
power with the doctor. It also means increasing insurer
control over the physicians choice of treatment, so that insurers
can "apply quality assurance or review of appropriateness." <a
href="#fn25">[25]</a></p>

<p> As Swiss medical philosopher Ernest Truffer has noted, the
increasing interjection of third-parties between doctor and
patient "amounts to a rejection of the medical ethic -- which is
to care for a patient according to the latter's specific (medical)
requirements -- in favor of a veterinary ethic, which consists in
caring for the sick animal not in accordance with its specific
medical needs, but according to the requirements of its master
and owner, the person responsible for meeting any costs
incurred." <a href="#fn26">[26]</a></p>

<p> Finally, the proposal is vague about how it will control overall
health costs. Advocates of managed competition have a tremendous
faith in the ability of "managed care" to control health care
costs, which is not surprising considering the close ties between
them and the managed care industry <a href="#fn27">[27]</a>.  However, a recent
survey indicated that half of employers who switched from non-managed care
plans to HMO's said their HMO rates were as high
or higher than their previous rates <a href="#fn28">[28]</a>. Likewise, a
Congressional Budget Office Report found that shifting Medicare patients to
HMO's "had little or no effect on hospital use and costs." <a
href="#fn29">[29]</a> In
addition, a recent Rand corporation study indicates that managed
care providers were as likely as fee-for-service providers to
perform unnecessary procedures. <a href="#fn30">[30]</a></p>

<p> It is very difficult to judge whether managed competition can
deliver its promised cost savings because no such system
currently exists anywhere in the world. However, it is at least
worth noting that one of the models for managed competition
cited by the Jackson Hole Group is the Federal Employee Health
Benefits Program (FEHBP) <a href="#fn31">[31]</a>.  However, despite recent
enthusiasm for FEHBP by some conservative groups such as the
Heritage Foundation <a href="#fn32">[32]</a>,  FEHBP costs have actually risen
faster than employer-provided health benefits in general <a
href="#fn33">[33]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name=libertarian>The Libertarian Alternative</a></h2>

<p> The Libertarian Party believes that the only health care
reforms which are likely to have a significant impact on
America's health care problems are those that draw on
the strength of the free market. The Libertarian Party has
developed a comprehensive proposal for health care reform that
will reduce health care costs, while extending access to care. It
is a program based on the idea that health care is a personal
responsibility, not a government one.</p>

<p> 1. Medical Savings Accounts.</p>

<p> Under federal tax law, money spent by an employer on a
worker's health insurance is not counted as taxable income to the
worker. Thus, even though that money is part of the worker's
total compensation, the worker avoids paying any income or
payroll taxes on it.</p>

<p> This tax treatment gives American workers and their families
very generous tax relief on their medical expenses, but only on
two conditions. First, they must obtain their medical care through
health insurance. And second, they must obtain their health
insurance through their employer.</p>

<p> In many cases, however, it would be more desirable or cost
effective to purchase low-cost or routine medical care directly
out-of-pocket rather than filing an insurance claim, or to buy a
different health insurance plan than the one offered by the
employer. Workers are heavily penalized for doing this because
they receive no tax relief for doing so.</p>

<p> To make matters worse, a worker who has employer-sponsored
health insurance, who is cost-conscious, and seeks out providers
who offer good quality at good prices, is not rewarded, since he
or she cannot pocket any savings. Moreover, physicians who
dispense more services, regardless of their benefit, or charge
higher prices, are rewarded with more income.</p>

<p> One method of solving this problem is the adoption of Medical
Savings Accounts (MSA) <a href="#fn34">[34]</a>,  under which an individual
should be exempted from taxes on money deposited in a medical savings
account in the same way that he currently pays no taxes on
deposits to an IRA. Money could be withdrawn from an MSA
without penalty to pay medical expenses <a href="#fn35">[35]</a>.  This would
increase consumer responsibility, while increasing access and controlling
costs. With such a program in place, employers could be
expected to change the way they provide insurance. Rather than
continuing to provide high-cost insurance benefits, with low
deductibles and extensive benefits, employers could provide
each employee with an annual allowance of perhaps $2,000,
which the employee could deposit in the MSA. For medical
expenses in excess of the $2,000, the employer would continue
to provide health insurance, but such catastrophic coverage
would be relatively inexpensive.</p>

<p> The individual would be responsible for paying his own health
care expenses under $2,000, using funds from the account <a
href="#fn36">[36]</a>.  It
should be noted that less than 12.5% of all insured individuals
have annual claims in excess of $2,000 <a href="#fn37">[37]</a>.</p>

<p> Unspent money in the account would accumulate and belong to
the account holder. Prior to age 65, there would be a penalty
applied to withdrawals for other than health care expenditures.</p>

<p> 2. Establish Tax Equity.</p>

<p> A second consumer-based reform is changing those tax laws that
discriminate against people that do not have employer-provided
health insurance. The solution: All health care expenditures
should be 100% tax deductible. In addition to expanding health
care access, such tax changes would 1) establish a basic fairness
in government policy -- giving the same tax break to the waitress
who has to buy her own health insurance that we are currently
giving to the well paid executives of wealthy corporations, and 2)
would hold down overall health care costs by increasing consumer
involvement in the health care marketplace.</p>

<p> The difference in tax treatment creates a disparity that effectively
doubles the cost of health insurance for those people who must
purchase their own. For example, the family of a self-employed
person, earning $35,000 per year, having to pay federal and
state taxes with only a 25% deduction, and having to pay Social
Security taxes, must earn $7,075 to pay for a $4,000 health
insurance policy. A person working for a small business that
offers no health insurance, would have to earn $8,214 to pay for
that $4,000 policy.</p>

<p> The results of this inequity can be clearly seen. Those workers
who must use after-tax dollars to purchase health insurance are
24 times more likely to be uninsured than those who are eligible
for tax-free employer-provided coverage <a href="#fn38">[38]</a>.</p>

<p> Significantly, the poor and minorities, who are less likely to have
employer-provided insurance, are the most likely to be left
without access to health insurance <a href="#fn39">[39]</a>.  Thus, the
perverse impact of our tax policies is to subsidize the purchase of health
insurance by the most affluent in society, while penalizing those less well
off <a href="#fn40">[40]</a>.</p>

<p> While limiting access to health insurance, our tax policies also
have an adverse impact on health care prices. By encouraging
employer-provided coverage to the detriment of individually-purchased
coverage and/or out-of-pocket payment, our tax
policy increases the trend toward divorcing the health care
consumer from health care payment.</p>

<p> As discussed previously, most health care consumers do not pay
for their health care. On the average, for every dollar of health
care services purchased, 76 cents is paid by someone other than
the consumer who purchased it <a href="#fn41">[41]</a>.  As a result, consumers
have little incentive to question costs and every incentive to demand
more services.</p>

<p> Establishing tax equity will encourage health care consumers to
become more involved in the health care system. Individuals who
purchase their own insurance are more likely to "shop around"
for the best deal. And, individuals who purchase health care out-of-pocket
are much more likely to make cost-conscious health
care decisions <a href="#fn42">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>3. Deregulate the health care industry.</p>

<p> There should be a thorough examination of the extent to which
government policies are responsible for rising health costs and
the unavailability of health care services. We can help lower
health care costs and expand health care access by taking
immediate steps to deregulate the health care industry, including
elimination of mandated benefits, repeal of the Certificate-of-Need
program, and expansion of the scope of practice for non-physician
health professionals.</p>

<p> For example, having decided that people are not smart enough
to choose their own health insurance benefits, every state has
laws that mandate that all health insurance contracts in their state
provide for coverage of specific disabilities/diseases and the
provision of specific health care services. These mandates add
significantly to the cost of health insurance <a href="#fn43">[43]</a>.</p>

<p> Blue Cross and Blue Shield of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/md/">Maryland</a> estimates
that mandated
benefits account for 13.3 percent of all claims dollars <a
href="#fn44">[44]</a>.  And, in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ma/">Massachusetts</a>,
Blue Cross and Blue Shield estimates that mandated
benefits add nearly $55 per month to the cost of a policy <a
href="#fn45">[45]</a>.
Surveys of small businesses have repeatedly shown that the cost
of health insurance is the number one reason why these
businesses do not offer health benefits. By making insurance
more expensive, mandated benefits are contributing directly to
the number of uninsured.</p>

<p> In addition, a majority of states continue to maintain regulatory
restrictions on health care services that act as a barrier to
competition, such as Certificate-of-Need requirements. This is
a regulation that says that if someone wants to build a new
hospital, or buy a new piece of medical equipment, or offer a new
type of medical service, they must first get permission from the
government.</p>

<p> Certificate-of-Need is based on the bizarre economic theory that
greater supply and increased competition will lead to higher
prices. However, studies have repeatedly demonstrated that
CON programs not only fail to contain costs, but may actually
lead to increased costs, while limiting the availability of medical
services, particularly in rural areas. The Trade Commission has
concluded that, on a national basis, "Hospital costs would decline
by $1.3 billion per year if states would deregulate their CON
programs <a href="#fn46">[46]</a>. </p>

<p> We also need to rethink our medical licensing laws. Studies have
repeatedly shown that qualified mid-level nonphysician practitioners
can perform many medical services traditionally performed by physicians.
Yet, the medical profession has consistently used licensure and other
regulatory restrictions to limit competition. The result has almost
inevitably been higher prices for consumers. For example, 37 states continue
to outlaw the practice of lay midwifery. In most states, nurse practitioners
cannot treat a patient without direct physician supervision.
Chiropractors cannot order blood tests or CAT scans. Nurses,
psychologists, pharmacists and other practitioners cannot prescribe
even the most basic medications <a href="#fn47">[47]</a>.</p>

<p> Deregulating the health care industry will reduce the cost of
health care overall, making health insurance more affordable
and, therefore, easier to obtain.</p>

<p> 4. Replace the FDA.</p>

<p> The Food and Drug Administration is one of the most dangerous
and counter-productive of all federal government agencies. The
mission of the FDA is obstensibly to protect the public from
unsafe and ineffective medicines (and foods of course). However,
in reality, the FDA has provided little protection, but has driven
up health care costs and deprived millions of Americans of the
health care treatment they need.</p>

<p> It now costs more than $231 million to bring a new drug to
market, an increase of 327% since 1976. It also takes approximately
12 years to complete the process <a href="#fn48">[48]</a>.  A substantial
portion of that time and money is the result of the FDA approval process.
Indeed, some studies indicate that the FDA doubles the cost of
developing a new drug <a href="#fn49">[49]</a>.  The cost, of course, is passed
along in the form of higher prices for consumers. In addition, the high cost
of the approval process acts as a barrier to entry, benefiting large
pharmaceutical companies, by preventing competition from
smaller firms that have limited financial resources.</p>

<p> Even more tragic is the loss of human life that results from delays
caused by the FDA approval process. For example, during the
10-year delay in allowing propanolol (the first widely used beta-blocker
for treatment of angina and hypertension) to be marketed
in the United states, approximately 100,000 people died because
the drug was unavailable <a href="#fn50">[50]</a>.  In addition, according to
George Hitchings, winner of the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine,
the FDA delay in approving the anti-bacterial drug Sepra cost
more than 80,000 lives <a href="#fn51">[51]</a>.</p>

<p> Now the FDA is attempting to expand its reach, seeking to
extend its authority to cover such items as vitamins and herbal
remedies. The agency is also seeking broader subpoena, seizure
and surveillance powers.</p>

<p> The FDA is clearly an unnecessary burden on the American
health care system. There is no evidence that the agency offers
Americans any real protection, but there is massive evidence that
it is causing great harm. The agency should be abolished and
replaced with voluntary certification by a private-sector organization,
similar to the way Underwriters Laboratory certifies
electrical appliances.</p>

<p> 5. Privatize Medicare and Medicaid.</p>

<p> The current Medicare and Medicaid systems have clearly failed.
Costs are skyrocketing. Medicare costs have increased to the
point where the system is in serious jeopardy. Medicare Part A,
which pays for hospital care and services, is projected to be
unable to meet its financial commitments by the year 2005. It is
estimated that to restore the fund's financial stability will require
increasing the Medicare payroll tax from 2.9% to at least 6.5%.
Medicare Part B, which pays for physician services, is hardly in
better shape. General revenue contributions to Medicare Part B
may increase 300% by the end of the century. And, premium
contributions by the elderly may have to increase by a similar
percentage <a href="#fn52">[52]</a>.</p>

<p> Medicaid is in much the same condition. The state share of the
joint federal-state program is growing twice as fast as overall
state spending. Some estimates indicate that state spending on
Medicaid could increase a phenomenal 480% by the year 2000.
The federal share of the program is growing even faster <a
href="#fn53">[53]</a>.</p>

<p> At the same time, patients are receiving second rate care. Studies
have shown that both Medicaid and Medicare patients have
higher mortality rates than patients with private insurance.</p>

<p> Finally, providers are being shortchanged. Both Medicare and
Medicaid reimburse providers at a rate well below the actual cost
of procedures. As a result, fewer and fewer providers are willing
to participate in the program. Those who do, pass along their
costs to patients with private insurance, a practice known as
cost-shifting.</p>

<p> The time is ripe for drastic reform. The federal government
should begin to restructure the system to give Medicaid and
Medicare recipients more flexibility to purchase private health
insurance. Some experts suggest a voucher system would be a
solid interim measure to bring Medicare and Medicaid recipients
back into the private sector <a href="#fn54">[54]</a>.  Other experts point to
the potential for expanding the role of nonprofit charitable institutions in
replacing government programs <a href="#fn55">[55]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name=summary>Summary</a></h2>

<p> The Libertarian Party believes that not only can free market
solutions to health care reform lower costs, expand access to
care, and protect individual choice, they are the only solutions
that will solve our nation's health care crisis.</p>

the consumer's co-payment. The study found that an individual with a 50%
co-payment spent  25% less on health care than an individual with no
co-payment. Manning, et. al, "Health Insurance and the Demand for Medical

<title>Health Care Fallacies</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Fallacies of the Health Care Debate</h1>

<p>August 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom
Isenberg</a>:</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Health care is a human right."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "No, health care is a product.  And you don't have the
right 
to force someone else to produce it for you.  That kind of slavery is a 
violation of real human rights."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Health care is a right".</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "Yes, you do have a right to health care. But  no one has 
an <em>obligation</em> to give it to you. You have a right to bear arms, but 
no one has an obligation to provide you with a gun. You have a right to 
free speech but no one has an obligation to listen to you."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Nationalized health care is necessary to give everyone
access 
to affordable health care."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "Then why don't we nationalize food, clothing, housing, 
jobs, transportation, sex, entertainment, and toilet paper? Doesn't 
everyone have a right to those necessities, as well?  And what makes 
you think it will work better here than it did in the Soviet Union?"</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Gun control is a health-care issue."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "Yes, without my gun, it is more difficult to defend my 
health from bad people and bad government."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "These opponents of nationalized health care are the same 
people who opposed Social Security, welfare, and Medicare."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "Any decent person who could have foreseen the disastrous 
consequences of these programs would have opposed them.  Let's not make 
the same mistake with our health care."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Demand the same right Congress has: guaranteed health
coverage."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b> "Why stop there?  Let's also demand the other 'rights' 
Congress has: $100K salaries, exemption from its own laws, and the 
power to control your life and spend your money."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Clinton at least deserves credit for starting the debate on

health care reform."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "Yes, and we should thank O.J. Simpson for starting the 
debate on domestic violence."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Americans should stop whining.  Compared to other
countries, 
Americans are undertaxed."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "And compared to many countries, Americans are
under-raped."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "America is the only industrialized country that does not 
provide 100% health care coverage."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "And if all the other industrialized countries jumped off
a 
bridge, would you too?"</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "We're just asking people to pay their fair share."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "Government is not about asking, it is about telling.  And

with the understood threat of violence if you do not fork over your 'fair
share.'"</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "The US spends a higher percentage of its GDP on health care

than any nation in the world."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "You get what you pay for, and that's why the US has the 
best health care system in the world.  To lower costs, we must increase 
competition among suppliers (by deregulating the existing physician and 
insurance cartels and monopolies and legalizing competition among all 
would-be health-care and insurance providers.)</p>

<title>FBI Targeted University President</title>
<!-- Place: Berkeley, California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1962 - 1968 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>FBI Targeted University President for Political Views</h1>

<p>The FBI targeted supporters of the 1960's Free Speech Movement at
the University of California at
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Berkeley.html">Berkeley</a>
for their political views, and
even tried to have the university's president fired.</p>

<p>The San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite> reported that the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ordered the FBI to release documents showing the FBI's
involvement in domestic politics at Berkeley.</p>

<p>Clark Kerr was president of UC-Berkeley from 1962 to 1968, during which
time the Free Speech Movement and Vietman war protests were blooming at the
university. The FBI disapproved of his handling of student exercise of free
speech (J. Edgar Hoover himself called Kerr "no good"), and lobbied the
university's Board of Regents to have him fired.</p>

<p>The FBI also leaked information from the CIA to the Board of Regents
concerning left-wing political activities of university staff.</p>

<title>Government Sues Housing Critics</title>
<!-- Place: Berkeley, California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: July 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>U.S. May Sue Foes of Plan for the Homeless</h1>

<p>The First Amendment to the United States Consitution protects freedom
of speech. Except ...</p>

<p>Politicians love exceptions.</p>

<p>As reported in the July 31, 1994, <cite>New York Times</cite>, p. A-13,
the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is investigating a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Berkeley.html">Berkeley</a>
resident for distributing political pamphlets against a proposed
homeless shelter.</p>

<p>The resident, Alexandra White, along with her husband Joseph Deringer
and neighbor Richard Graham, may be prosecuted under the Federal Fair
Housing Act. If convicted, they could receive a $10,000 fine plus
"restitution."</p>

<p>HUD is using the Fair Housing Act to silence critics of its programs.
The act prohibits housing discrimination on such basis as race, mental
illness or drug abuse. HUD officials claim private citizens' opposition
to housing programs on such grounds is itself housing discrimination.</p>

<p>As the <cite>Times</cite> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HUD used the Fair Housing Act against an avowed white supremacist who
taunted and threatened a black resident in Vidor, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>.  An administrative
law judge ordered the racist to pay more than $300,000 for emotional distress
as well as $10,000 for discriminatory housing practices.</p>

<p>... Federal investigators asked for every article, flier and letter to the
editor that Ms. White, Mr. Deringer and Mr. Graham had written about the
Bel Air, as  well as minutes from any meeting they have spoken at, said
David Bryden, their lawyer.</p>

<p>Ann Brick, a lawyer with the <a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ACLU.html">
American Civil Liberties Union</a> of Northern 
California, called the HUD investigation disturbing.  "There's a big
difference between the HUD going after a government body denying permits
and going after citizens complaining about a project," Ms. Brick said.
"We may not find their opposition admirable, but it's a fundamental
right of citizens to make their views known."</p>

<title>Copyright</title>
<!-- Place: England (UK), USA -->
<!-- Time: 1600s? - present -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Copyrights</h1>

<p>Copyrights, and the idea of intellectual property in general, are an
interesting issue for libertarians. Does freedom of speech and of the press
include the right to repeat someone else's writings? Or is there a real
property interest in ideas?</p>

<p>Copyrights today are intended to allow the author of a work to gain the
benefits of the work, presumably encouraging the production of more such
works.</p>

<p>That's now how copyrights started. In 17th-century England, copyrights were
introduced as a government-sanctioned monopoly for booksellers in exchange for
the booksellers' acquiesence to restrictions on freedom of the press.
Copyrights were essentially a bribe to reduce opposition to the English
government's encroachment on individual rights.</p>

<p>The fact that copyrights are not permanent, but for a specific duration,
underscores the fact that they are a matter of privilege not right. Even if one
concedes the benefits of having copyrights, the duration of copyrights is still
a matter of debate.</p>

<p>The U.S. Constitution specifically authorizes Congress to set the duration
of copyrights, but says copyrights must be of limited duration. Congress has
somewhat stretched their authority by repeatedly extending copyright durations;
if they continue to do so, they will in effect be making copyrights
permanent.</p>

<p>In the U.S., copyrights lasted 56 years, until a 1976 law extended them to
75 years. As of May 1995, there is a proposal in Congress (H.R. 989 and S. 483)
to lengthen the duration to 95 years.</p>

<p>The "hard-core" libertarian approach to copyrights would be to abolish them
altogether, as a government-imposed monopoly. A more moderate approach would be
to lessen their duration.</p>

<title>Campaign Financing</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: study released September 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Campaign Finance Limits Ineffective</h1>

<p>When all the media and Congress agree on something, it's time to
check your shoes.</p>

<p>Campaign finance reform is not a lofty means of ending special interest
influence but instead is an unconscionable limit on free speech, ineffective
against special interests and a form of protection for incumbents.</p>

<p>In September 1995, the <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato
Institute</a> released its Policy Analysis no. 238, "Campaign Finance
Regulation: Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences", by Capital
University law professor Bradley A. Smith.</p>

<h2>Ineffective Against Special Interests</h2>

<p>"Special interests" (meaning everyone favoring government programs we
dislike) have always found ways around campaign finance limits and always
will.</p>

<p>The real problem is not that special interests can persuade Congress to
manipulate the economy, restrict individuals' choices and get the U.S.
entangled in foreign affairs. The problem is that Congress has the power
to do any of those things.</p>

<p>As long as Congress has the ability to give benefits to some people
at others' expense, people will vie to be in the "beneficiary"
category rather than the "benefactor" category.</p>


<h2>Protecting Incumbents</h2>

<p>Money does not close the political process but instead opens it.
Incumbents have name recognition and some identification with ideas;
challengers need to spend money to get the same. As Smith observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although reform advocates say we spend too much on political campaigns,
total spending for candidates for all offices is less than $10 per eligible
voter every two years.</p>

<p>Because money is of much greater value to challengers than to incumbents,
higher spending opens up the political system to new people and ideas.</p>

<p>While many assume that large contributions are undemocratic, most
challenges to the status quo and most working-class political movements
have been financed by wealthy donors.</p>

<p>... Big spending does not guarantee success. Michael Huffington,
Lewis Lehrman, Mark Dayton, John Connally, and Clayton Williams are
just a few candidates who spent lavishly and lost.</p>

<p>The politicians who designed campaign finance laws rigged the system
to give incumbents an advantage. Even in the 1994 elections, 91.4 percent
of congressional incumbents seeking reelection won.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Restricting Free Speech</h2>

<p>Limits on campaign contributions restrict how and to whom a person may
show political support. Disclosure laws can be used to ban anonymous or
pseudonymous pamphlets, one of the primary means of communication in
the birth of the U.S. Public financing of campaigns forces taxpayers to
subsidize speech with which they disagree.</p>

<p>Campaign finance limits also give certain people's political speech
more weight than others. As Smith says, "campaign finance laws give
media moguls more opportunity than other wealthy people to support the
candidates they prefer."</p>

<h2>True Campaign Finance Reform</h2>

<p>A libertarian version of campaign finance reform would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dismantle the Federal Election Campaign Act and the Federal Election
	Commission bureaucracy</li>
<li>Reject proposals for public financing, which force taxpayers
	to fund campaigns</li>
<li>Return to the campaign "regulation" system found in the
	First Amendment -- "Congress shall make no law ...  abridging the
	freedom of speech."</li>
</ul>

<title>House Passes Free Speech Exception</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: June 28, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Free Speech, Except ..</h1>

<p>Republicans and Democrats have trouble with freedom. A <em>little</em>
freedom is fine, they say, as long as there are exceptions.</p>

<p>On June 28, 1995, the U.S. House approved a proposed constitutional
amendment to ban flag-burning. The measure passed 312-120, well over the
two-thirds majority required.</p>

<p>The Senate must also approve the measure by a two-thirds majority for it
to be sent to the state legislatures, three-fourths of which must approve it
for the amendment to become part of the Constitution.</p>

<p>The amendment would allow Congress and state legislatures to "prohibit
the physical desecration of the flag of the United States."</p>

<p>Libertarians believe in freedom, period, no and's, if's or but's. There's
no such thing as half-way freedom. Either you make your decisions, or someone
else makes your decisions. Congress and state legislatures have no moral
authority to tell individuals what they can do with their own property,
including flags.</p>

<h1>Quotes on Freedom of Expression</h1>

<hr>

<h2>FBI Director on Privacy</h2>

<p>If five years from now we [the FBI] solve the access problem, but what we're
hearing is all encrypted, I'll probably, if I'm still here, be talking about
that in a very different way: the objective is the same. The objective is for
us to get those conversations whether they're by an alligator clip or ones and
zeros.  Whoever they are, whatever they are, I need them.</p>

<p>-- FBI Director <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis
Freeh</a>, clarifying statements that the FBI may seek
legislation to ban strong encryption, in an October 1994 interview with Steven
Levy.</p>

<p>Not just the Chinese government, but all governments, are concerned that
information on the Internet could cause social instability.</p>

<title>The Jonestown Massacre</title>
<!-- Place: Jonestown (Guyana) -->
<!-- Time: mass suicide November 18, 1978 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Jonestown Massacre</h1>

<p>On November 18, 1978, over 900 members of a religious group led by
the Reverend Jim Jones were killed in an apparent mass suicide. The
megalomaniac Jones convinced most of his followers to drink a cyanide
mixture. Some, including Jones, were shot, either in suicide or murder.</p>

<p>Shortly before the mass suicide, U.S. Congressman Leo Ryan was assassinated
on Jones' orders. Ryan had just landed in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/SouthAmerica/Guyana/">Guyana</a> to investigate
alleged human rights abuses at Jonestown.</p>

<p>Jim Jones, born May 13, 1931 in Lynn, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/in/">Indiana</a>,
had his own religious
congregation, the People's Temple Full Gospel Church, in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/in/Indianapolis.html">Indianapolis</a>
by 1963. Jones led the interracial congregation (rare at the time) with
faith healing, visions and advice from extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>After spending a short time in Brazil, Jones moved his congregation to
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>. He
eventually moved it again to an isolated area of Guyana jungle,
naming the new settlement after himself.</p>

<p>Rumors abound of government connections to the Guyana tragedy.</p>

<p>A former Jones cult member, Phil Kerns, wrote a book claiming that
"Jones was a Marxist who had numerous contacts with officials of both the
Cuban and Soviet governments."</p>

<p>Others claim the CIA was involved in Jonestown, possibly as part of a
mind control experiment. The CIA definitely had operations in socialist
Guyana, and was certainly interested in cult members' Soviet embassy visits.
The CIA did have a mind control program, MK-ULTRA, the famous "LSD in your
coffee" experiments. One of Leo Ryan's congressional aides, among others,
suspects that the CIA did not disband the program in 1973, as it claims, but
instead continued the effort in religious cults like Jonestown.</p>

<p>In 1980, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence reported
"no evidence" of CIA involvement in Jonestown.</p>

<h1>Humor and Religion</h1>

<hr><h2>Particular Athiest</h2>

<p>When I told the people of Northern Ireland that I was an atheist,
a woman in the audience stood up and said, "Yes, but is it the 
God of the Catholics or the God of the Protestants in whom you don't 
believe?"</p>
<p>-- Quentin Crisp</p>

<hr><h2>Something Fishy</h2>

<p>A Catholic priest, Baptist minister and Jewish rabbi are fishing in
a boat. They run out of bait, but left their bait box on the shore.
The priest says, "I'll go get some more," steps out of the boat, and
walks across the water to the shore and back again. The rabbi is amazed
but says nothing.</p>

<p>A little later, they run out of bait again. This time, the minister
says, "I'll get it," steps out of the boat, and walks across the water
to the shore and back again. The rabbi wonders at this.</p>

<p>They run out of bait a third time. Now, the rabbi says, "This time
I'll get it." He steps out of the boat, and splash! falls in over his
head. The minister says to the priest, "Do you think we should have 
told him where the rocks are?"</p>

<hr><h2>Golfing</h2>

<p>A priest goes out golfing with a nun as caddy. On one hole the
priest slices terribly. "Damn! I missed!" he yells. "Father, you
shouldn't say such things," the nun says. "I'm sorry, sister,"
the priest says.</p>

<p>The next hole, the priest hits the ball way to the left. "Damn!
I missed!" he yells. "Father, you really should watch your language,
God doesn't appreciate that," the nun says. "I'm sorry, sister, it
won't happen again," the priest says.</p>

<p>On the next hole, the priest hits the ball into a sandtrap. "Damn!
I missed!" he yells. All of a sudden the sky darkens, thunder sounds,
and a lightning bolt flashes down and fries the nun. A big voice booms,
"Damn! I missed!"</p>

<hr>
<h2>Dangerous</h2>

<p>Q. What goes clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop, BANG!?</p>
<p>A. An Amish drive-by shooting.</p>

<h1>The U.S. Mail Monopoly</h1>

<p>Of all the ridiculous ideas thought up by advocates of big government,
one of the worst has got to be the idea that the U.S. federal government
should deliver all the mail in the entire country. What advantage does
government have in delivering mail? They keep costs down so well? They're
so in tune with the customer? I don't get it. Government is there, essentially,
to kill people or lock them up. That's what it's good at. Delivering the mail
is best left to private companies.</p>

<h1>The Internet</h1>

<p>The Internet will rank with the printing press and the automobile as
innovations that revolutionized society. Science, government, commerce,
recreation and politics are all moving in new directions as the result of
the Internet. Information services are already estimated to comprise 50%
of the U.S. economy.</p>

<p>The encouraging thing is that the Internet is empowering individuals.
Hell, any old yahoo can set up his own web site and reach the world (see,
for example, <a href="/revolution/">Revolution</a>). As should be
expected, governments worldwide are trying to restrict the Internet and
its effects.</p>

<title>H.R. 185 (Telecommunications Drug Enforcement Act of 1995)</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: March 1995 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Telecommunications Drug Enforcement Act of 1995</h1>

<p>March 19, 1995, posted by Frank Lofaro (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a href="mailto:ftlofaro@unlv.edu">ftlofaro@unlv.edu</a>) to
<img src="/images/news.gif" alt="[NEWS]"><a
href="news:comp.org.eff.talk">comp.org.eff.talk</a>:</p>

<p> HR 185, the Telecommunications Drug Enforcement Act of 1995 would
mandate that the courts order the disconnection and/or refusal of
mobile phone service to anyone the Federal or a State government can
show <em>probable cause</em> that said person is involved in drug trafficking.</p>

<p> A conviction is not needed, just the same standard used to give a
search warrant. Probable cause is quite easy to prove. One anonymous
tip often does the trick. When the government gets that, they can
<em>compel</em> any public or <em>private</em> carrier to disconnect and/or
refuse service. Basically the government can just order anyone's service
turned off and/or refused. With the probable cause standard it is
quite easy (trivial in fact) for them to at least temporarily get
anyone off the air that the government does not like, or is
communicating anything the government does not want communicated. The
bill says people can still pursue remedies to get service restored or
any government mandated refusals lifted, but that could take a very
long time, up to (possibly even beyond) the length of a trial. During
all this time, an innocent person could be denied mobile service.</p>

<p>Consider that this would also effect mobile Internet sites (they still
need to use mobile communications). Consider that this would open the
door for expansion beyond just mobile services. Consider that this
could very well be the first step to the mandating of an off switch in
every network hookup that the government could flip any time they felt
something was obscene, threatened national security, was used in drug
trafficking, or was something they did not like.</p>

<p>Remember, probable cause does <em>not</em> require due process! Consider
that the government could cut service if they even thought such transmission was
likely to occur in the near future. You could start saying something
controversial and get cut off, courtesy of Big Brother. And anyone refusing to
implement such a cut off mechanism or trying to bypass or prevent such a block
would be prosecuted, probably for a felony (long prison, government
takes half your rights away for life).</p>

<hr>

<p>Side note: a reader noted that "probable cause" means "articulatable 
facts which by themselves would lead an ordinary person of prudence to
believe that a crime has occurred and that a specific person has committed,
or is about to commit a crime."</p>

<p>The main points of the above message are still relevant -- probable
cause is not being used in this case to get a search warrant, but to
cut off a person from telecommunications access in a society where that
is becoming increasingly important. A central concept of our legal
system is that the higher the stakes, the greater the burden of proof
is on the state. Probable cause is enough for a search warrant, but
not for the death penalty. Taking away liberties, such as being able to
communicate freely, should only be done upon conviction of a crime.</p>

<title>Telecom Law</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: February 8, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Telecom Law Deregulates, Regulates</h1>

<p>On February 8, 1996, the U.S. government enacted a new telecommunications
law. On the good side, the law extensively deregulates significant aspects
of the telecommunications industry, from cable to local phone service. On
the bad side, the law increases regulation of content (<a
href="/revolution/express/techno/exon/">censorship</a>) in
telecommunications including the Internet.</p>

<p>The law is the first major overhaul of U.S. telecommunications policy
since 1934. Since 1984, local and long distance telephone service has been
under control of the consent decree signed at the breakup of the
AT&amp;T monopoly. The new law replaces the consent decree, and amends
the 1934 law.</p>

<p>Positive aspects of the law include:</p>
<dl>

<dt><p>Local phone companies will be allowed to offer long distance
service.</p>
<dd><p>The seven RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating Companies, or Baby Bells)
plan to enter the long-distance market in the next few years.</p></dd>

<dt><p>Local phone service will no longer be a monopoly.</p></dt>

<dt><p>Pricing will simplify.</p></dt>
<dd><p>With repeal of current rules, flat rate per minute long distance calls
may become common.</p></dd>

<dt><p>New areas of competition make "bundles" possible.</p></dt>
<dd><p>With fewer restrictions, many companies will compete to be
a single source of telecommunications services by offering bundles
including local phone, long distance, cellular, entertainment and
Internet services.</p></dd>

<dt><p>Broadcasting will have fewer restrictions.</p><dt>
<dd><p>Broadcasters have been restricted in their market reach by
various arbitrary numbers, like no more than twelve television stations
reaching 25% of the country. The new law's arbitrary limits are fewer
and higher, allowing companies to own any number of TV stations, but
no more than 35% reach.</p></dd>

<dt><p>Cable price regulation will be ameliorated.</p></dt>
<dd><p>After 1999, cable service beyond the "basic tier" will not
be price regulated.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>The above changes will likely result in a wave of mergers, split-ups,
acquisitions and divestitures as the market realigns itself to natural
boundaries.</p>

<p>Competition will likely result in a lowering of
prices, although increased demand for telecommunications services tends
to counteract this effect. In the short term, local phone rates may rise,
as they have been previously subsidized by long-distance access charges,
and competitors will need time to install completely separate networks.</p>

<p>Negative aspects of the new law include:</p>
<dl>

<dt><p>Big Brother in your TV set.</p></dt>
<dd><p>The new law mandates that all new television sets include the
"V-chip," a computer chip that will block out "violent" programming as
determined by an industry board operating under a government chilling
effect.</p></dd>

<dt><p><a href="/revolution/express/techno/exon/">Big Brother
on the Internet.</a></p></dt>
<dd><p>The unconstitutional Exon amendment censoring the Internet was
included in the final law.</p></dd>

<h1>Cryptography</h1>

<p>Cryptography is the art of making and breaking codes. Crypto is
at the center of electronic privacy, being able to communicate privately
with whom you choose -- and keeping everyone else, including
government agents, from listening in.</p>

<p>The United States considers encryption technology a munition,
putting it under the same export controls used for nuclear weapons.
Ironically, the computer source code for an encryption algorithm can
be exported outside the United States without controls, but an
electronic copy of the same code is restricted.</p>

<p>Topics in crypto:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="pgp/">Pretty Good Privacy</a>: protection for the masses
<li><a href="escrow/">Key escrow</a>: encryption with built-in
	wiretap, including the notorious Clipper Chip</a>
<li><A href="bernstein.html">Export controls ruled unconstitutional</a></li>

<title>Clipper Chip</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>The "Clipper Chip" is a general name for a proposal originating in the
Bush administration and pushed by the Clinton administration to establish
a federal encryption standard that includes a "back door" for law
enforcement.</p>

<p>Clipper is actually comprised of several parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Skipjack encryption algorithm, which is classified, forms the
basis for the Clipper components.
<li>The Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) is intended to replace the current
Digital Encryption Standard (DES). EES involves components using the Skipjack
algorithm, with skeleton keys held by federal agencies. Law enforcement
officials (with a warrant of course, trust us) could obtain the escrowed
keys to decrypt any EES-encrypted data.
<li>The Clipper chip itself implements EES for telephones.
<li>The Capstone chip implements EES for computers.
<li>The Tessera card is a PC card containing Capstone.
</ul>

<p>When the Clinton White House announced plans to implement EES, the online
community reacted strongly. As a result, plans for Capstone and Tessera were
put on hold. Although the administration initially said they never intended
to ban other means of encryption, FBI director <a
href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis Freeh</a> later said he would
seek such a ban if criminals didn't use EES (duh).</p>

<p>EES met strong online opposition, and several Congressman promised to
block appropriations for EES. After the 1995
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a>
<a href="/revolution/multi/war/okc/">Federal Building bombing</a>,
reptilian opportunists like Clinton seized the chance to rush through a
Counter-Terrorism Bill, which included funding for Clipper.</p>

<p>To try to rescue the sinking Clipper Chip, U.S. federal agencies
proposed a variation called Commercial Key Escrow, in which private
companies would hold the skeleton keys and provide them to police
when presented with a warrant.</p>

<h1>NSA's Super Spy Satellite</h1>

<p>"Damn the Torpedoes," by Loring Wirbel (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a href="mailto:lwirbel@eet.cmp.com">lwirbel@eet.cmp.com</a>),
from p. 134 of the June 6, 1994 <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://eet.cmp.com/"><cite>Electronic Engineering Times</cite></a>:</p>

<p> ... the little-noted launch of a gargantuan satellite from Cape
Canaveral on May 3.</p>

<p> The $1.5 billion satellite is a joint project of the NSA and the
National Reconaissance Office (NRO).  At five tons, it is heavy enough
to have required every bit of thrust its Titan IV launcher could
provide -- and despite the boost, it still did enough damage to the
launch-pad water main to render the facility unusable for two months.</p>

<p> The satellite is variously known as Mentor, Jeroboam and Big Bertha, and
it has an antenna larger than a football field to carry out
"hyper-spectral analysis" -- Reconnaissance buzzwords for real-time
analysis of communications in a very wide swath of the electromagnetic
spectrum ...</p>

<p> Mentor surprised space analysts by moving into a
geostationary orbit.  Geostationary orbit allows the satellite to "park"
over a certain sector of the earth.</p>

<p> This first satellite in a planned series was heading for the Ural
Mountains in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russia</a> at last notice. 
Additional launches planned for
late 1994 will park future Mentors over the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p> According to John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists, those
satellites will likely be controlled from Buckley Field
(<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/Aurora.html">Aurora</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/">Colorado</a>),
an NSA/Reconnaissance downlink base slated to become this hemisphere's
largest intelligence base in the 1990's.</p>

<p> Multiple Mentors will make it easy for technical intellicence agencies to
perform an unannounced "breakout" from their pledges to refrain from
domestic surveillance.  That is in addition to mandated use of
<a href="/revolution/express/techno/crypto/clipper/">Clipper</a>
and the Digital Signature Standard -- a requirement that will give the NSA
and National Reconaissance Office the capability in theory, if not in
practice -- to monitor all Internet and National Information
Infrastructure traffic anywhere in the world.  Given the ambitions of
the NSA and Reconaissance, Clipper's opponents may have confined their
arguments to too limited a scope.</p>

<title>Testimony of James Wright</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->

</head>

<body>

<h1>Ten Fundamental Gun Facts</h1>

<p>March 31, 1995 statement of Tulane University criminologist James Wright
before the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Crime of
the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p><i>Dr. WRIGHT:</i> Thank you so much, and thank you for the opportunity to be
here.  My name is James Wright... and I'm a professor of sociology at Tulane
University.  I've spent the last twenty years of my academic career conducting
research on guns and violence in American society.  In the course of these two
decades, I have come to the conclusion that there are at least ten simple, but
terribly important facts about guns in America that every participant in the
gun control debate should be aware of.  I have referred to these in a recent
paper as "Ten Essential Observations on Guns in America," and my point is to
share them with the Committee today.</p>

<p> While many of the facts of the gun control issue are hotly contested, and
matters of great dispute, the ten fundamental truths that I wish to discuss are
matters about which everyone more or less agrees.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="households.html">Half of U.S. households own guns</a>
<li><a href="circulation.html">200,000,000 firearms are in the U.S. now</a>
<li><a href="sport.html">Most guns are owned for recreation</a>
<li><a href="defense.html">Many guns are owned for defense against crime</a>
<li><a href="retail.html">Bad guys don't buy guns through retail channels</a>
<li><a href="violence.html">Bad guys carry guns for surviving violent world</a>
<li><a href="law.html">Bad guys indifferent to existing gun control laws</a>
<li><a href="demand.html">Demand for guns creates its own supply</a>
<li><a href="evil.html">Guns are not inherently good or evil</a>
<li><a href="culture.html">Guns are part of the American culture</a>
</ol>
 
<p>And, thank you so much for your attention.  Dr. Bordua...</p>

<h1>Firearms Humor</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</h2>

<p>I thought I saw this somewhere before, but a Libernet poster attributed
this to Todd Prior (todd@ftp.com):</p>

<p>I was bored last week and a thought occured to me.  Why is it that there is a
government bureau which oversees alcohol, tobacco, and firearms?  I was bored
enough to call up the regional office of said bureau.  I asked the man who
answered the phone "What wine goes best with an M-16?"  He did his best to be
helpful, however.  "That depends.  What are you smoking?"</p>

<hr>

<h2>Alternative Interpretation of Militia</h2>

<p>From William A. Arvola (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:arvola@sol.acs.unt.edu">arvola@sol.acs.unt.edu</a>), University of
North Texas Department of Mathematics, (817) 565-4701, Denton, TX 76203:</p>

<p>The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution states:
"A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state,
the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."
The classical pro-firearms doctrine states that "well-regulated militia"
means "well-trained armed citizens."</p>

<p>My objection is that I resent being told by a bunch of dead guys what it
means to be a "well-behaved citizen".  I am one of the sovereign people of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> after all. 
On the other hand, I thoroughly endorse their criteria for
what it means to be a "well-behaved government".
So, I got out my "big" dictionary and looked up "well-regulated
militia".</p>

<p>"Regulate" comes from "regula" meaning "law" or "order". Hence, "regulate"
means "to bind by law" or "to put in good order".  So, "well-regulated" means
"law-abiding", "orderly" or "well-behaved".  So far so good.  But now:
"Militia" is the plural of "miles" meaning "soldier"! "Soldier" comes from
"soldare" meaning "to pay". In other words, "militia" = "soldiers" =
"paid agents"!</p>

<p>The Second Amendment now reads:  "Well-behaved soldiers being
necessary to ...".  I can hear the voices of indignation
already.  But hold your criticisms for one moment more, I ask.
The Amendment calls for good behavior by government agents
and provides a remedy for bad behavior: "As a defense against badly-behaved
paid agents of the government, these being a threat to liberty, the right
of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."</p>

<p>So if they wish to say that "militia" = "National Guard", I say fine!
And if they ask what is "bad behavior" for an agent of
the government, I point to the rest of the Bill of Rights.
Note that no burden is placed on the right or the people.
The burden is on the government, as it should be. Perhaps Mason and <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/JamesMadison.html">Madison</a>
snuck in <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Jefferson's</a>
"right to revolt" after all!</p>

<title>Police Protection Not Enough</title>
<!-- Place: London (UK); UK; DC (USA); USA -->

	1800's - 1900's -->

<h1>Police Protection Is Not Enough</h1>

<p>The following is an article by Peter Kasler. I don't know how to get in
touch with the author, and am reprinting this without permission until I
find out. It's just too good.</p>

<p>"Police Have No Duty To Protect Individuals" by Peter Kasler.
COPYRIGHT 1992 Peter Alan Kasler.</p>

<p> All our lives, especially during our younger years, we hear that
the police are there to protect us. From the very first kindergarten-class
visit of "Officer Friendly" to the very last time we saw a police
car - most of which have "To Protect and Serve" emblazoned on their doors -
we're encouraged to give ourselves over to police protection. But it hasn't
always been that way.</p>

<p> Before the mid-1800s, American and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> citizens - even in large
cities - were expected to protect themselves and each other. Indeed, they
were legally required to pursue and attempt to apprehend criminals. The
notion of a police force in those days was abhorrent in England and America,
where liberals viewed it as a form of the dreaded "standing army."</p>

<p> England's first police force, in London, was not instituted until
1827. The first such forces in America followed in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York</a>,
Boston, and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/Philadelphia.html">Philadelphia</a>
during the period between 1835 and 1845. They were established
only to augment citizen self-protection. It was never intended that they act
affirmatively, prior to or during criminal activity or violence against
individual citizens. Their duty was to protect society as a whole by
deterrence; i.e., by systematically patrolling, detecting and apprehending
criminals after the occurrence of crimes. There was no thought of police
displacing the citizens' right of self-protection. Nor could they, even if it
were intended.</p>

<p> Professor Don B. Kates, Jr., eminent civil rights lawyer and
criminologist, states:</p>

<p> Even if all 500,000 American police officers were assigned to patrol,
they could not protect 240 million citizens from upwards of 10 million
criminals who enjoy the luxury of deciding when and where to strike. But we
have nothing like 500,000 patrol officers; to determine how many police are
actually available for any one shift, we must divide the 500,000 by four
(three shifts per day, plus officers who have days off, are on sick leave,
etc.). The resulting number must be cut in half to account for officers
assigned to investigations, juvenile, records, laboratory, traffic, etc.,
rather than patrol.<a href="#fn1">[1]</a></p>

<p> Such facts are underscored by the practical reality of today's
society. Police and Sheriff's departments are feeling the financial
exigencies of our times, and that translates directly to a reduction of
services, i.e. even less protection. For example, one moderate day recently
(September 23, 1991) the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanFrancisco.html">San
Francisco</a> Police Department "dropped"<a href="#fn2">[2]</a> 157
calls to its 911 facility, and about 1,000 calls to its general telephone
number (415-553-0123). An SFPD dispatcher said that 150 dropped 911 calls,
and 1,000 dropped general number calls, are about average on any given
day.<a href="#fn3">[3]</a></p>

<p> It is, therefore, a fact of law and of practical necessity that
individuals are responsible for their own personal safety, and that of
their loved ones. Police protection must be recognized for what it is:
only an auxiliary general deterrent.</p>

<p> Because the police have no general duty to protect individuals,
judicial remedies are not available for their failure to protect. In other
words, if someone is injured because they expected but did not receive police
protection, they cannot recover damages by suing (except in very special
cases, explained below). Despite a long history of such failed attempts,
however, many, people persist in believing the police are obligated to
protect them, attempt to recover when no protection was forthcoming, and are
emotionally demoralized when the recovery fails. Legal annals abound with
such cases.</p>

<p> <cite>Warren v. District of Columbia</cite> is one of the leading cases of this
type. Two women were upstairs in a townhouse when they heard their roommate,
a third woman, being attacked downstairs by intruders. They phoned the police
several times and were assured that officers were on the way. After about 30
minutes, when their roommate's screams had stopped, they assumed the police
had finally arrived. When the two women went downstairs they saw that in fact
the police never came, but the intruders were still there. As the Warren
court graphically states in the opinion: "For the next fourteen hours the
women were held captive, raped, robbed, beaten, forced to commit sexual acts
upon each other, and made to submit to the sexual demands of their attackers."</p>

<p> The three women sued the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">District of Columbia</a>
 for failing to protect
them, but D.C.'s highest court exonerated the District and its police, saying
that it is a "fundamental principle of American law that a government and its
agents are under no general duty to provide public services, such as police
protection, to any individual citizen."<a href="#fn4">[4]</a> There are many
similar cases with results to the same effect.<a href="#fn5">[5]</a></p>

<p> In the <cite>Warren</cite> case the injured parties sued the District of
Columbia under its own laws for failing to protect them. Most often such cases
are brought in state (or, in the case of <cite>Warren</cite>, D.C.) courts for
violation of state statutes, because federal law pertaining to these matters
is even more onerous. But when someone does sue under federal law, it is
nearly always for violation of 42 U.S.C. 1983 (often inaccurately referred to
as "the civil rights act"). Section 1983 claims are brought against
government officials for allegedly violating the injured parties' federal
statutory or Constitutional rights.</p>

<p> The seminal case establishing the general rule that police have no duty under
federal law to protect citizens is <cite>DeShaney v. Winnebago County
Department of Social Services</cite>.<a href="#fn6">[6]</a>
Frequently these cases are based on an alleged "special relationship" between
the injured party and the police. In <cite>DeShaney</cite> the injured party
was a boy who was beaten and permanently injured
by his father. He claimed a special relationship existed because local
officials knew he was being abused, indeed they had "specifically proclaimed
by word and deed [their] intention to protect him against that
danger,"<a href="#fn7">[7]</a>
but failed to remove him from his father's custody.</p>

<p> The Court in <cite>DeShaney</cite> held that no duty arose because of a
"special relationship," concluding that Constitutional duties of care and protection
only exist as to certain individuals, such as incarcerated prisoners,
involuntarily committed mental patients and others restrained against their
will and therefore unable to protect themselves. "The affirmative duty to
protect arises not from the State's knowledge of the individual's predicament
or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation which
it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf."<a href="#fn8">[8]</a></p>

<p> About a year later, the United States Court of Appeals interpreted
<cite>DeShaney</cite> in the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>
case of <cite>Balistreri v. Pacifica
Police Department</cite>.<a href="#fn9">[9]</a> Ms. Balistreri, beaten and
harassed by her estranged husband,
alleged a "special relationship" existed between her and the Pacifica Police
Department, to wit, they were duty-bound to protect her because there was a
restraining order against her husband. The Court of Appeals, however,
concluded that <cite>DeShaney</cite> limited the circumstances that would
give rise to a "special relationship" to instances of custody. Because no such custody
existed in <cite>Balistreri</cite>, the Pacifica Police had no duty to
protect her, so when they failed to do so and she was injured they were not liable. A citizen
injured because the police failed to protect her can only sue the State or
local government in federal court if one of their officials violated a
federal statutory or Constitutional right, and can only win such a suit if a
"special relationship" can be shown to have existed, which
<cite>DeShaney</cite> and its progeny make it very difficult to do. Moreover,
<cite>Zinermon v. Burch</cite><a href="#fn10">[10]</a> very
likely precludes Section 1983 liability for police agencies in these types of
cases if there is a potential remedy via a State tort action.</p>

<p> Many states, however, have specifically precluded such claims,
barring lawsuits against State or local officials for failure to protect, by
enacting statutes such as California's Government Code, Sections 821, 845,
and 846 which state, in part: "Neither a public entity or a public employee
[may be sued] for failure to provide adequate police protection or service,
failure to prevent the commission of crimes and failure to apprehend
criminals."</p>

<p> It is painfully clear that the police cannot be relied upon to
protect us. Thus far we've seen that they have no duty to do so. And we've
also seen that even if they did have a duty to protect us, practically-
speaking they could not fulfill it with sufficient certainty that we would
want to bet our lives on it.</p>

<p> Now it's time to take off the gloves, so to speak, and get down to
reality. So the police aren't duty-bound to protect us, and they can't be
expected to protect us even if they want to. Does that mean that they won't
protect us if they have the opportunity?</p>

<p> One of the leading cases on this point dates way back into the
1950s.<a href="#fn11">[11]</a>
A certain Ms. Riss was being harassed by a former boyfriend, in a
familiar pattern of increasingly violent threats. She went to the police for
help many times, but was always rebuffed. Desperate because she could not get
police protection, she applied for a gun permit, but was refused that as
well. On the eve of her engagement party she and her mother went to the
police one last time pleading for protection against what they were certain
was a serious and dangerous threat. And one last time the police refused.
As she was leaving the party, her former boyfriend threw acid in her face,
blinding and permanently disfiguring her.</p>

<p> Her case against the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">City of
New York</a> for failing to protect her
was, not surprisingly, unsuccessful. The lone dissenting justice of New
York's high court wrote in his opinion: "What makes the City's position
[denying any obligation to protect the woman] particularly difficult to
understand is that, in conformity to the dictates of the law [she] did not
carry any weapon for self-defense. Thus, by a rather bitter irony she was
required to rely for protection on the City of New York which now denies all
responsibility to her."<a href="#fn12">[12]</a></p>

<p> Instances of police refusing to protect someone in grave danger, who
is urgently requesting help, are becoming disturbingly more common. In 1988,
Lisa Bianco's violently abusive husband was finally in jail for beating and
kidnapping her, after having victimized her for years. Ms. Bianco was
somewhat comforted by the facts that he was supposedly serving a seven-year
sentence, and she had been promised by the authorities that she'd be notified
well in advance of his release. Nevertheless, after being in only a short
time, he was temporarily released on an eight-hour pass, and she wasn't
notified. He went directly to her house and, in front of their 6- and 10-
year old daughters, beat Lisa Bianco to death.</p>

<p> In 1989, in a suburb of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a>, Maria Navarro called the L. A.
County  Sheriff's 911 emergency line asking for help. It was her birthday and
there was a party at her house, but her estranged husband, against whom she
had had a restraining order, said he was coming over to kill her. She
believed him, but got no sympathy from the 911 dispatcher, who said: "What do
you want us to do lady, send a car to sit outside your house?" Less than half
an hour after Maria hung up in frustration, one of her guests called the same
911 line and informed the dispatcher that the husband was there and had
already killed Maria and one other guest. Before the cops arrived, he had
killed another.</p>

<p> But certainly no cop would stand by and do nothing while someone was
being violently victimized. Or would they? In <cite>Freeman v.
Ferguson</cite><a href="#fn13">[13]</a> a
police chief directed his officers not to enforce a restraining order against
a woman's estranged husband because the man was a friend of the chief's. The
man subsequently killed the woman and her daughter. Perhaps such a specific
case is an anomaly, but more instances of general abuses aren't at all rare.</p>

<p> In one such typical case<a href="#fn14">[14]</a>,
a woman and her son were harassed,
threatened and assaulted by her estranged husband, all in violation of his
probation and a restraining order. Despite numerous requests for police
protection, the police did nothing because "the police department used an
administrative classification that resulted in police protection being fully
provided to persons abused by someone with whom the victim has no domestic
relationship, but less protection when the victim is either: 1) a woman
abused or assaulted by a spouse or boyfriend, or 2) a child abused by a
father or stepfather."<a href="#fn15">[15]</a></p>

<p> In a much more recent case,<a href="#fn16">[16]</a> a woman claimed she
was injured because the police refused to make an arrest following a domestic
violence call. She claimed their refusal to arrest was due to a city policy of
gender-based discrimination. In that case the U. S. District Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit held that "no constitutional violation [occurred] when
the most that can be said of the police is that they stood by and did
nothing ..."<a href="#fn17">[17]</a></p>

<p> Do the police really harbor such indifference to the plight of
certain victims? To answer that, let's leave the somewhat aloof and
dispassionate world of legal precedent and move into the more easily
understood "real world." I can state from considerable personal experience,
unequivocally, that these things do happen. As to why they occur, I can offer
only my opinion based on that experience and on additional research into the
dark and murky areas of criminal sociopathy and police abuse.</p>

<p> One client of my partner's and mine had a restraining order against
her violently abusive estranged husband. He had recently beaten her so
savagely a metal plate had to be implanted in her jaw. Over and over he
violated the court order, sometimes thirty times daily. He repeatedly
threatened to kill her and those of us helping her. But the cops refused to
arrest him for violating the order, even though they'd witnessed him doing so
more than once. They danced around all over the place trying to explain why
they wouldn't enforce the order, including inventing numerous absurd excuses
about having lost her file (a common tactic in these cases). It finally came
to light that there was a departmental order to not arrest anyone in that
county for violating a protective order because the county had recently been
sued by an irate (and wealthy) domestic violence arrestee.</p>

<p> In another of our cases, when Peggi and I served the man with
restraining orders (something we're often required to do because various law
enforcement agencies can't or won't do it), he threatened there and then to
kill our client. Due to the vigorous nature of the threat, we went
immediately to the police department to get it on file in case he attempted
to carry it out during the few days before the upcoming court appearance. We
spent hours filing the report, but two days later when our client went to the
police department for a copy to take to court, she was told there was no
record of her, her restraining order, her case, or our report.</p>

<p> She called in a panic. Without that report it would be more difficult
securing a permanent restraining order against him. I paid an immediate visit
to the chief of that department. We discussed the situation and I suggested
various options, including dragging the officer to whom Peggi and I had given
the detailed death threat report into court to explain under oath how it had
gotten lost. In mere moments, an internal affairs officer was assigned to
investigate and, while I waited, they miraculously produced the file and our
report. I was even telephoned later and offered an effusive apology by
various members of the department.</p>

<p> It is true that in the real world, law enforcement authorities very
often do perpetuate the victimization. It is also true that each of us is the
only person upon whom we can absolutely rely to avoid victimization. If our
client in the last anecdote hadn't taken responsibility for her own fate, she
might never have survived the ordeal. But she had sufficient resolve to fend
for herself. Realizing the police couldn't or wouldn't help her, she
contacted us. Then, when the police tried their bureaucratic shuffle on her,
she called me. But for her determination to be a victim no more, and to take
responsibility for her own destiny, she might have joined the countless
others victimized first by criminals, then by the very system they expect
will protect them.</p>

<p> Remember, even if the police were obligated to protect us (which they
aren't), or even if they tried to protect us (which they often don't, a fact
brought home to millions nationwide as they watched in horror the recent
events in Los Angeles), most often there wouldn't be time enough for them to
do it. It's about time that we came to grips with that, and resolved never to
abdicate responsibility for our personal safety, and that of our loved ones,
to anyone else.</p>

<title>Firearms in the Home</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: late 1900's -->

<h1>Firearms in the Home</h1>

<p>July 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/D/DavidDeming.html">David
Deming</a>:</p>

<p>I have come to the conclusion that most advocates of gun control simply are
ignorant of the facts regarding the relationship between violence and 
firearms. Typical of these is the letter by Ellen Scheer which appeared in
the <cite>Oklahoman</cite> last Saturday, July 2. Ms. Scheer cites the
discredited study by Kellerman et al. which concluded that "in a home with
a gun....a family member is 43 times more likely to be shot than an 
intruder."  However, Ms. Scheer does not tell us that of the 43 shootings,
37 are suicides. We may reasonably conclude that these suicides would not
have been prevented by the absence of a firearm, because it is well 
known that gun availability does not influence suicide rates. For example,
private gun ownership in Japan is virtually unknown, yet the suicide rate
in Japan is twice that of the U.S..</p>

<p>There are two other flaws in the Kellerman study cited by Ms. Scheer. The
first of these is that Kellerman did not consider instances where a gun 
was used to ward off an anticipated criminal act but not fired, or was fired
and did not result in a death. Professor Gary Kleck of Florida State
University has estimated that guns are used for self defense against
criminals more than 2 million times a year.  In more than 98% of these 
cases the gun is not fired. Professor Kleck is a self-described liberal
Democrat and <a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ACLU.html">ACLU</a> member who has
never accepted any funding from the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>
or any other gun rights organization. Kleck's research is important in that
he is regarded by his colleagues as the leading expert on the subject of
firearms and violence.</p>

<p>For example, Kleck's book <cite>Point Blank:  Guns and Violence in
America</cite> was the winner of the 1993 Hindelang award from the American
Society of Criminology for "the book published in the past two years that
makes the most outstanding contribution to criminology". The other major 
flaw in the Kellerman study is that Kellerman groups the socially
dysfunctional with normal people, yet most familial gun violence is found
almost exclusively within a pathological subset of the general population:  
alcoholics, career criminals, drug addicts, etc. Professor Kleck has
concluded that for most people "the risks of a fatal gun accident are
negligible". When all of the defensive uses of firearms are factored in and
the suicides factored out, we find that a homeowner is 200 times more likely
to use a gun to prevent a criminal assault than to cause the death of an
innocent member of the household.</p>

<p>Ms. Scheer informs us that the U.S. has a teen-age murder rate seven times
higher than any nation in Western Europe. Presumably, Ms. Scheer is implying 
that the higher incidence of gun ownership in the U.S. causes the increased
violence. However, she does not consider the most obvious alternative
hypothesis:  that an increased level of violence leads to a higher level of
gun ownership for defensive purposes.  Gun ownership is only one of many
variables that affect violence levels in different countries, societies, and
cultures. When factors such as race and culture are taken in consideration,
it is usually found that increased gun ownership is correlated with lower
violence levels. For example, the homicide rate amongst individuals of
Japanese ancestry living in America is less than half that of Japanese in
Japan.</p>

<p>I agree with Ms. Scheer that "gun violence costs too much ... to allow it to
increase any further." However, the consensus amongst serious and unbiased
researchers is that the availability of guns amongst the general population
certainly does not cause violent crime, and probably is an inhibitor of such
crime. Ignorance is not a virtue, and gun control policies conceived in
ignorance are likely to increase suffering amongst the innocent, not 
alleviate it.</p>

<title>Firearms Used In Crime</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->

</head>

<body>

<h1>Firearms Used In Crime</h1>

<p><cite>USA Today</cite> published a full page graphic of the
most popular "crime guns" as reported by the Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms. Only one so-called assault weapon
is on the list and it is number 9:</p>

<ol>
<li>Smith & Wesson .38 Special Revolver
<li>Raven Arms .25 caliber
<li>Davis P-380
<li>Smith & Wesson .357 Revolver
<li>Ruger .22 caliber
<li>Lorcin L-380
<li>Smith & Wesson semiautomatic handgun
<li>Mossberg 12 gauge shotgun
<li>Tech DC-9
<li>Remington 12 gauge shotgun
</ol>

<p>Any numbers from BATF are suspect, both because BATF has an agenda to push
and because states don't uniformly report crime statistics to the federal
government. Nonetheless, the info above is useful, if taken with a grain of
salt.</p>

<title>American Criminals Move to Japan</title>
<!-- Place: Tokyo, Japan -->
<!-- Time: April 20, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>An American Gangster in Japan</h1>

<p>April 1994, from Tom Wyld of <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>
Public Affairs (703-267-3820):</p>

<p> CLINTON OFFICIAL CONFIRMS PRIVATE GUN OWNERSHIP IN AMERICA DETERS CRIME</p>

<p> Washington, D.C. -- Days before the U.S. Congress holds hearings on whether to ban guns, a Clinton Administration official -- former Vice
President Walter Mondale -- confirmed that private gun ownership in
America deters crime and sends criminals packing.</p>

<p> In an April 20 message from the American Embassy in Tokyo, Ambassador
Mondale reported that a twenty-member gang moved to Japan after
finding criminal activity in this country "too dangerous because of
the prevalence of guns in the homes.  After two dozen successful
burglaries in gun-free Tokyo, they managed to mail over six million
dollars worth of stolen cash and jewels" to conspirators in Colombia.</p>

<p> For research on gun ownership as a crime deterrent, consult <cite>Point
Blank</cite> (1991; NY:  Aldine de Gruyter) by Gary Kleck, Professor of
Criminology, Florida State University.</p>

<p> For a critical review of international gun laws, see <cite>The Samurai, The
Mountie and the Cowboy (Should America Adopt the Gun Controls of
Other Democracies?)</cite> (1992; NY: Prometheus Books) by David Kopel.

<h1>Self-defense</h1>

<p>Opponents of the right to self defense often claim that firearms are not
good defensive weapons. These cases bear witness otherwise. While other
documents seek to give arguments and statistics to back up gun rights,
this one consists entirely of real-world examples of self defense. Most
involve firearms, a few involve other weapons.</p>

<h1>BATF Shoots Collector</h1>

<p>On June 7, 1971, ski-mask wearing BATF agents used a battering ram to
break into the home of Kenyon Ballew. Based on an incorrect tip from a
burglar, they were looking for grenades, which turned out to be legal
empty grenade hulls.</p>

<p>Responding to his wife's screams, Ballew grabbed an antique blackpowder
pistol, and was shot by BATF agents. He remains confined to a wheelchair.</p>

<title>Congress Criticizes BATF</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: July 1979, April 1980, October 1980-->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Congressional Hearing Blasts BATF</h1>

<p>The criminal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) was
investigated by Congress in hearings before the Subcommittee on Treasury,
Post Office and General Appropriations of the Senate Appropriations Committee
in July 1979 and April 1980, and before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of
the Senate Judiciary Committee in October 1980.</p>

<p>The final report called BATF's enforcement tactics
<font size=+1>"constitutionally, legally, and practically reprehensible"</font>
and said there is "little doubt that
the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of
the United States."</p>

<p>In particular, the report found of the BATF:</p>
<ul>
<li>"It has trampled upon the Second Amendment by chilling exercise of the
right to keep and bear arms by law abiding citizens."
<li>"It has offended the Fourth Amendment by unreasonably searching and seizing
private property."
<li>"It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property without just
compensation and by entrapping honest citizens without regard for their right
to due process of law."
<li>"Approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary
citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge."

<title>BATF Harasses Sporting Goods Store</title>
<!-- Place: Marin County, California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: January or February 1991? -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>BATF Harasses Businessman for Maintaining Rights</h1>

<p>The BATF revoked the Federal Firearms License (FFL) of a sporting
goods store owner who refused to comply with an illegal request.</p>

<p>As reported by Neal Talbot in the March 1, 1991 <cite>Gun Week</cite>,
Kirby Ferris was contacted by the BATF to schedule an inspection of his
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Marin.html">Marin County</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> sporting
goods store. A BATF agent said the BATF
would inspect his records and check his list of customers "against the crime
computer."</p>

<p>Ferris knew that the Form 4473's that firearms purchasers fill out is
supposed to remain private except when a particular weapon has been used in
a crime or a particular purchaser is a suspect.</p>

<p>When the BATF arrived to conduct the inspection, Ferris, along with four
witnesses and a video camera, asked the BATF to sign a release holding
Ferris blameless for the BATF's violation of the Privacy Act of 1974 (improper
use of confidential information). The BATF refused to sign the release and
left.</p>

<p>The BATF warned Ferris to submit to the warrantless search. Ferris wrote
Harry Alder, the local head of the BATF, demanding that he "cease and desist"
and pointing out the federal statutes making such a search illegal.</p>

<p>Alder responded by revoking Ferris' FFL and threatening him with up
to $250,000 in fines and 5 years in prison. Ferris demanded an administrative
review (part of due process) but was refused.</p>

<p>The warrantless inspection is part of the BATF's "Operation Forward Trace,"
which a federal judge has prohibited in his <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a> jurisdiction
pending a final
ruling in a court case involving the tactics.</p>

<title>Urgent Express Mail</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>USPS Claims Monopoly Over Non-Urgent Mail</h1>

<p>Few people realize that sending mail via Federal Express or other private
carrier is illegal unless the mail is "urgent." And guess what, the Post Office
gets to define urgent.</p>

<p>As reported in the December 20, 1993 <cite>Washington Post</cite>
("Enforcing Its Monopoly To the Letter at USPS"), the U.S. Postal Service
fined credit reporting company Equifax Inc. $30,000 for using private shippers
for routine letters and financial statements.</p>

<p>As the <cite>Post</cite> said, "the majority of U.S. companies probably
violate the law routinely out of simple ignorance."

<p>U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Georgia) introduced legislation in 1993 to
prevent penalties for private carrier use. (An interesting aside is that
Coverdell was elected with Libertarian help.)</p>

<p>The <cite>Post</cite> quoted a postal spokesman as given the age-old
"cream-skimming" argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Postal Service was established to give universal service to
everybody at the same rate, whether you're in the bush country of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ak/">Alaska</a>
or the bottom of the Grand Canyon," said spokesman Paul Griffo.
"In order to provide that service you can't have people skimming off
lucrative areas of our revenue."</p>

<p>... Griffo said postal inspectors conducted 12 audits in the past year and
identified $312,000 in potential lost revenue, compared with two
audits the previous year in which $89,000 in lost revenue was identified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that argument were true, then why not declare "bush country" open to
competition? Because the Post Office would get flattened even in the
areas with the smallest profit margin. They're bloated and inefficient and
they know it.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Shuts Down Internet Providers</title>
<!-- Place: Hong Kong -->
<!-- Time: March 3, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Hong Kong Shuts Down Internet Providers</h1>

<p.From a March 8, 1995 press release by Philip Wong, Chairman of Asia Online
Ltd.:</p>

<p> On Friday March 3, 1995 the offices of Asia On-Line were raided by
officers of <a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/HongKong/">Hong Kong's</a>
 Commercial Crime Bureau accompanied by officials
of the Office of the Telecommunications Authority, or OFTA. Our
equipment was seized and our on-line services were shut down. According
to the police at the time of the raid, police statements since and the
wording of the search warrant, the raid was for operating a
telecommunications service without a licence.</p>

<p> This raid occurred while we were in active dialog with OFTA about
obtaining proper licensing. I myself held a meeting with OFTA four days
before the raid. I was told that the licensing issue was still under
investigation and that our services were not in danger. However, to be
on the safe side, we wrote a letter to OFTA and began the process of
applying for a PNETS licence anyway. OFTA has also publicly stated that
the telecommunications ordinance, which was written long before the
Information Super Highway existed, has many grey areas that needed
clearing up before the licensing issue could be resolved. In a letter of
January 19, OFTA said that it would advise us on licensing requirements
and procedures once their investigations were complete.</p>

<p> OFTA now claims that it did not initiate the raids and only took part as
technical advisers. They further said in a statement that the raid was
part of a CCB investigation into computer hacking. The police have never
made any mention of computer hacking.</p>

<p> We believe miscommunication between these two organisations has resulted
in a serious blunder which could affect Hong Kong's worldwide reputation
for freedom of information and fair business practices. About 10,000
people have suddenly been cut off from their worldwide links through the
Internet, some of whom rely on this for their livelihood. Potentially 40
million people on the Intemet have been cut off from Hong Kong. In
short, Hong Kong has been isolated from the world's Information Super
Highway.</p>

<p> Six other companies offering similar services were also raided and shut
down on the same day.</p>

<h1>Malaysia Offended by Internet</h1>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Malaysia/">Malaysian</a> government
is offended that people are criticizing
Malaysia on the Internet. Information Minister (what an Orwellian title)
Mohamed Rahmat condemned the dissent, saying that Malaysian students abroad
are smearing the country's good name and the government is considering
laws to curb such "abuses." Rahmat suggested that people seeking information
about Malaysia read officially sanctioned sources such as <cite>The Star</cite>
and <cite>Berita Harian</cite> newspapers.</p>

<p>Awww, we're sorry, we never meant to offend any anal bureaucrats in some
country that can't tell its information policy from a hole
in the ground. <b>Revolution</b> extends a hearty welcome to all Malaysians
who have disobeyed their government and read this page!</p>

<title>Vietnam and the Internet</title>

<body>

<h1>Vietnam Prepares to Join the Internet</h1>

<p>In January 1996,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Vietnam/">Vietnam</a>
 installed the equipment for its first
full, commercial link to the Internet. The Vietnamese government
controls the link and set it up to block material they do not want.</p>

<p>Vietnamese dissident Ha Si Phu's 1995 arrest brought no internal
publicity and little international publicity in major media, but the
Internet spread the news to every corner of the globe. As has become
common with repressive regimes across the world, overseas citizens
are using the Internet to criticize the government and call for reform.</p>

<p>The Vietnamese government exercises a high degree of control over
information, selectively monitoring telephone and fax calls, requiring
permission for satellite dishes, and censoring foriegn publications entering
the country. Despite these efforts, banned material thrives in an
underground market. The Internet will prove even more difficult to control.</p>

<p>Only a small fraction of the 70 million Vietnamese have access to
the one of the estimated 60,000 computers in the country. Communications
infrastructure is growing however; Vietnam now has thousands of international
telephone lines, compared to nine in 1987.</p>

<p>Six organizations currently provide email access to the Internet in
Vietnam.</p>

<p><b>Revolution</b> extends a hearty welcome to any Vietnamese citizens
who have thwarted their government in reaching this page.</p>

<title>Arabs Censor Internet</title>
<!-- Place: Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain -->
<!-- Time: Jordan access contract 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Arabs Try to Censor Internet</h1>

<p>Other than speech, the Internet may well be the most successful means
of communication invented by man. It is decentralized, resilient and
easily used by individuals. As such, it is a threat to governments worldwide,
who universally desire to limit the information seen by their subjects.</p>

<p>The Arab world presents one of the most obvious examples. Middle
Eastern dictatorships like Saudi Arabia, Jordon, Kuwait and Bahrain
seek to prevent their subjects from accessing pornography, dissident
views of government and criticism of the Muslim faith. Warming the
hearts of conservatives everywhere, the Arabs "get tough" by torturing,
maiming, imprisoning and fining violators.</p>

<p>In a worldwide trend, the Arab dictatorships are attempting to gain
the economic benefits of Internet access while preventing the Internet
from undermining their tyranny. Of course, they don't have a choice about
either; free-minded citizens find ways around the government to accomplish
both. Many Saudi citizens pay $100 in long distance charges to download
a single pornographic picture from the Internet, risking serious punishments
in addition to the high phone charges.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Jordan/">Jordan</a> contracted with
GlobeNet, a U.S. firm, to provide Internet access
with a screening facility allowing Jordanian censors to preview pictures
before they can be transmitted to subscribers. Carlton Tolsdorf, vice president
of GlobeNet and reprehensible reptile, said "We agreed with the authorities'
request. And, by the way, I think we shouldhave the same thing back home in
the United States."</p>

<p>As is becoming common, exiled dissidents from the dictatorships are
using the Internet to spread news repressed by official media and to
criticize government actions.</p>

<p>An interesting facet unique to the Middle East is that the Internet
may actually serve to lessen the millenia-old hatred between Israelis and
Arabs, by allowing ordinary people to see beyond the official propaganda
of their governments. Although most Arab nations ban contacts with Israel,
Israeli sites including the Jerusalem Post proliferate on the Internet.</p>

<p><b>Revolution</b> extends a hearty welcome to any Arabic freethinkers
who have evaded their government's restrictions to see this page.</p>

<title>China and the Net</title>
<!-- Place: China -->
<!-- Time: February 15, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>China Gets Wired</h1>

<p>On February 15, 1996, China ordered all Internet users to register
with the police within thirty days.</p>

<p>The Internet is revolutionizing every aspect of society. One of its
effects is empowerment of individuals, which makes totalitarian
governments (and wannabes) wary of connecting to it. At the same time,
economic and military reality dictates that advanced information technology
is essential to survival in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>

<p>The totalitarian Communist dictatorship of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China</a> is now attempting to
get Chinese universities on the Internet, while at the same time prevent
dissenting opinions, pornography and other unwanted material.
Already, about six thousand computers in China are connected to the
Internet. The state-run Xinhua News Service reported that China had
40,000 Internet accounts as of July 1995. The actual number is likely
much higher.</p>

<p>The Boston <cite>Globe</cite> reported that Chen Tongbao, director of the
new-technology division in China's Bureau of Scientific and Technical
Information, praised the benefits of the Internet for scientific research,
but said, "information coming from the Internet is closely related
to cultural, social and political issues. Some unhealthy information comes in
-- information that is not good for young people." Chen noted that "it is
very difficult to prevent" discussion of disapproved material.</p>

<p>To put it another way, young people armed with information are not good
for Communist dictatorships.</p>

<p>China believes it can limit Internet access to scientific and technical
disciplines without giving hackers and dissenters a chance to express their
version of the Internet society. Among China's ideas is China Internet
Corporation, for commercial Internet use and controlled by the state-run
Xinhua News Agency. Users must access the 'net in Xinhua offices.</p>

<p>Another more chilling idea was the Ministry of Public Security's
February 1996 directive to all users of the Internet and other
international computer networks to register with the police within
thirty days of signing up for service or switching service providers.
Yang Zhihui, a cog in the censorship bureaucracy, was quoted as saying
registration would "promote the healthy development of the country's
information industry."</p>

<p>Another straightjacket on the Internet is China's bottlenecks:
the Ministry of Post Telecommunications is the sole (legal) provider
of connections between Chinese computer users and international networks,
and Xinhua is the censor for foreign news agencies that want to
provide economic news services to Chinese customers.</p>

<p>James Chu, chief executive officer of China Internet, says "not just the
Chinese government, but all governments, are concerned that information on
the Internet could cause social instability."</p>

<p><b>Revolution</b> gives a hearty welcome to all Chinese citizens who have
managed to circumvent their country's controls to view this page!</p>

<h1>Singapore Licenses, Restricts Internet Service</h1>

<p>Governments have always tried to restrict the flow of undesirable
information -- undesirable to them anyway. The Internet stomps all over
these plans, routing information in such a way to make censorship practically
impossible. Of course, that doesn't stop governments from trying.</p>

<p>In March 1996, the Singapore government announced that all Internet
service providers <em>and content providers</em> in the country must
be licensed by the Singapore Broadcast Authority. The government
prohibits pornography, hate literature and other information
not in accordance with "local values" (government interests).</p>

<p>Providers like schools, libraries and Internet cafe&eacute;s must not
only censor their users' content, but also supervise use of public
terminals.</p>

<p>An estimated 100,000 Singaporeans use the Internet. Revolution
extends a hearty welcome to Singaporeans who defy their government
to view criticism of it!</p>

<h1>Banned Magazine Goes Online</h1>

<p>Sometimes, even governments can be cool, even if they don't really
want to be.</p>

<p>In March 1996, the
<A href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Indonesia/">Indonesian</a> government
allowed the staff of
<cite>Tempo</cite> magazine to publish an online version, even though
the government banned the print version of the magazine in June 1994,
on the grounds that it threatened national stability.</p>

<p>The Indonesian Information Minister told the parliament that there
was no need to consider the subject, as Indonesia does not yet regulate
the Internet. "They may enter the Internet, everyone may," he said.</p>

<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a

<title>French ISPs Protest</title>

<h1>French ISPs Protest Arrests, Shut Down Usenet</h1>

<p>In early May 1996, French police shut down France's two largest
Internet access providers and arrested their top executives after finding
child pornography in Usenet, an Internet service for discussion groups
carried by the providers. The heads of FranceNet and WorldNet face up to
three years in prison and around US$100,000 in fines.</p>

<p>Internet providers across France responded by staging a "strike,"
closing off access to the entire Usenet collection of thousands of
discussion topics beginning May 8. The strike ended May 14 after
French Telecommunications Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon agreed
that providers should not be held liable for their users' actions.</p>

<p>Most Usenet groups are freely accessible, allowing anyone to
read and write messages on any topic. The Internet provider industry
has generally argued that providers should be viewed as similar to
telephone companies with regards to not being liable for their
users' conversations if illegal.</p>

<p>France also restricts speech on other topics, such as racism
and World War II.</p>

<h1>United Arab Emirates Want to License Internet</h1>

<p>The Middle East, with its Muslim dictatorships, is one of the
most censorious areas of the planet. Political, religious and
sexual expression is heavily restricted. The Internet poses a
direct threat to this order, empowering the individual to access
information and resisting all attempts at restriction.</p>

<p>In June 1996, the police chief of Dubai,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/UAE.html">United Arab Emirates</a>
called for the state information ministry and the police to issue
"Internet licenses" rather than the 60% state-owned telecommunications
company. In response to the criticism, the company pulled its
representative from the government board overseeing Internet use.</p>

<p>A local newspaper quoted the police chief,
"In all cases, the information should be filtered, scanned and then made
available to users."</p>

<p>The <b>Revolution</b> issues a hearty welcome to anyone in
the UAE who circumvented their government to read this page!</p>

<h1>Steve Jackson Games Vs. The U.S. Government</h1>

<p>I was forwarded this account by Joe Abernathy of <a
href="/revolution/by_name/J/SteveJackson.html">Steve Jackson</a> Games'
lawsuit against the Secret Service. I am unsure how to get in touch with the
author and whether this is freely distributable or not. I'm assuming it
is ...</p>

<h2>Steve Jackson Games/Secret Service Lawsuit -- Day One</h2>

<p>by Joe Abernathy</p>

<p> AUSTIN -- Plaintiff's attorneys wrested two embarrassing admissions 
from the United States Secret Service on the opening day of a federal 
civil lawsuit designed to establish the bounds of constitutional 
protections for electronic publishing and electronic mail.</p>

<p> In the first, Special Agent Timothy Foley of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>
admitted that 
crucial statements were erroneous in an affidavit he used to conduct 
several search-and-seizure operations in a March 1990 crackdown on 
computer crime.</p>

<p> Foley later conceded that the Secret Service's special training for 
computer crime investigators overlooks any mention of the law that 
regulates the extent of permissible search-and-seizures at publishing 
operations.</p>

<p> The case, brought by Steve Jackson Games, an
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Austin.html">Austin</a>
firm, is being 
tried before United States District Judge Sam Sparks. Carefully 
nurtured over the course of three years by a group of electronic civil 
rights activists -- at a cost of more than $200,000 -- the case has 
been eagerly anticipated as a possible damper on what is seen as 
computer crime hysteria among federal police.</p>

<p> Plaintiffs hope to prove that the printed word exists just as surely on 
the computer screen as it does on a sheet of paper. The complaint also 
seeks to establish the right of computer users to congregate 
electronically on bulletin board systems -- such as one called 
Illuminati that was taken from Steve Jackson Games -- and to exchange 
private electronic mail on such BBSs.</p>

<p> "This lawsuit is just to stand up and say, at the end of the 20th 
Century, that publishing occurs as much on computers as on the printed 
page," said Jim George, of the Austin firm George, Donaldson & Ford, 
Jackson's law firm.</p>

<p> That issue came into sharp focus during George's questioning of Foley 
regarding the seizure of the PC on which Illuminati ran, and another 
computer on which was stored the word processing document containing a 
pending Steve Jackson Games book release, GURPS Cyberpunk.</p>

<p> "At the Secret Service computer crime school, were you, as the agent in 
charge of this investigation, made aware of special rules for searching 
a publishing company?" George asked Foley. He was referring to the 
Privacy Protection Act, which states that police may not seize a work 
in progress from a publisher. It does not specify what physical form 
such a work must take.</p>

<p> "No, sir, I was not," Foley responded.</p>

<p> "Did you just miss class the day that was taught?" George asked.</p>

<p> "No, sir. The United States Secret Service does not teach its agents 
about special rules regarding search and seizure at publishing 
companies," Foley said.</p>

<p> "Let the record clearly show that to be the case," George said.</p>

<p> Earlier, Foley admitted on the witness stand that his original 
affidavit seeking a judge's approval to raid Steve Jackson Games 
contained a fundamental error.</p>

<p> During the March 1990 raid -- one of several dozen staged that day 
around the country in an investigation that the Secret Service called 
Operation Sun Devil at the time -- agents were seeking copies of a 
document taken as a hacker trophy from Bell South. Subsequently 
republished in an electronic magazine called Phrack, thousands of 
copies of the document were stored on bulletin board systems around the nation.</p>

<p> Neither Jackson nor his company were suspected of wrongdoing, and no 
charges have ever been filed against anyone targeted in several Austin 
raids.  The alleged membership of Steve Jackson employee Loyd 
Blankenship in the Legion of Doom hacker's group -- which was believed 
responsible for the break-in -- led agents to raid the Austin game 
publisher at the same time that Blankenship's Austin home was raided.</p>

<p> Yet the only two paragraphs in the 42-paragraph indictment that 
established a connection between Blankenship's alleged illegal 
activities and Steve Jackson Games were shown to have been erroneously 
arrived at, when George produced a statement by Bellcore expert Henry 
Kluepfel disputing statements attributed to him in Foley's affidavit.</p>

<p> "Is it true that Mr. Kluepfel logged onto (Illuminati)?" George questioned.</p>

<p> "No, sir," Foley responded.</p>

<p> "But you state that in your affidavit," George said.</P>

<p> "That was a misattribution," Foley said.</P>

<p> "So you had no knowledge that anything was sent to my client?"</p>

<p> "No sir, not directly," Foley said.</p>

<p> "Indirectly?" George asked.</p>

<p> "No sir."</p>

<p> The Justice Department, in papers filed with the court, contends that 
only traditional journalistic organizations enjoy the protections of 
the Privacy Protection Act. It further contends that users of 
electronic mail have no reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>

<p> The trial was to resume at 8:30 a.m. It is expected to conclude on 
Thursday or Friday.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Steve Jackson Games/Secret Service Trial -- Day Two</p>

<p>by Joe Abernathy</p>

<p> AUSTIN -- A young woman read aloud a deeply personal friendship letter 
Wednesday in a federal civil lawsuit intended to establish the human 
dimension and constitutional guarantees of electronic assembly and 
communication.</p>

<p> Testimony indicated that the letter read by Elizabeth Cayce-McCoy 
previously had been seized, printed and reviewed by the Secret Service.</p>

<p> Her correspondence was among 162 undelivered personal letters testimony 
indicated were taken by the government in March 1990 during a raid on 
Steve Jackson Games, which ran an electronic bulletin board system as a 
service to its customers.</p>

<p> Attorneys for the Austin game publisher contend that the seizure of the 
bulletin board represents a violation of the Electronic Communications 
Privacy Act, which is based on Fourth Amendment protections against 
unreasonable search and seizure.</p>

<p> "Because you bring such joy to my friend Walter's life, and also 
because I liked you when I met you, though I wish I could have seen 
your lovely face a little more, I'll send you an autographed copy of 
Bestiary," said McCoy, reading in part from a letter penned by Steffan 
O'Sullivan, the author of the GURPS Bestiary, a fantasy treatise on 
mythical creatures large and small.</p>

<p> Although the correspondence entered the public record upon McCoy's 
reading, the Chronicle obtained explicit permission from the principles 
before excerpting from it.</p>

<p> The electronic mail was contained on the game publisher's public 
bulletin board system, Illuminati, which allowed game-players, authors 
and others to exchange public and personal documents. After agents 
seized the BBS during a raid staged as part of a nationwide crackdown 
on computer crime, Secret Service analysts reviewed, printed and 
deleted the 162 pieces of undelivered mail, testimony indicated.</p>

<p> When the BBS computer was returned to its owner several months later, a 
computer expert was able to resurrect many of the deleted 
communications, including McCoy's friendship letter.</p>

<p> "I never thought anyone would read my mail," she testified. "I was very 
shocked and embarrassed.</p>

<p> "When I told my father that the Secret Service had taken the Steve 
Jackson bulletin board for some reason, he became very upset. He 
thought that I had been linked to some computer crime investigation, 
and that now our computers would be taken."</p>

<p> O'Sullivan, who is a free-lance game writer employed by Steve Jackson, 
followed McCoy to the stand, where he testified that agents intercepted 
-- via the Illuminati seizure -- a critical piece of electronic mail 
seeking to establish when a quarterly royalty check would arrive.</p>

<p> "That letter never arrived, and I had to borrow money to pay the rent," 
he said.</p>

<p> No charges were ever filed in connection with the raid on Steve Jackson 
Games or the simultaneous raid of the Austin home of Jackson employee 
Loyd Blankenship, whose reputed membership in the Legion of Doom 
hackers' group triggered the raids.</p>

<p> Plaintiffs contend that the government's search-and-seizure policies 
have cast a chill over a constitutionally protected form of public 
assembly carried out on bulletin boards, which serve as community 
centers often used by hundreds of people. More than 300 people were 
denied use of Jackson's bulletin board, called Illuminati, for several 
months after the raid, and documents filed with the court claim that a 
broader, continuing chill has been cast over the online community at large.</p>

<p> The lawsuit against the Secret Service seeks to establish that the 
Electronic Communications Privacy Act guarantees the privacy of 
electronic mail.  If U.S. District Court Judge Sam Sparks accepts this 
contention, it would become necessary for the government to obtain 
warrants for each caller to a bulletin board before seizing it.</p>

<p> The Justice Department contends that users of electronic mail do not 
have a reasonable expectation to privacy, because they are voluntarily 
"disclosing" their mail to a third party -- the owner of the bulletin 
board system.</p>

<p> "We weren't going to intercept electronic mail. We were going to access 
stored information," said William J. Cook, a former assistant U.S. 
Attorney in Chicago who wrote the affidavit for the search warrant used 
in the Steve Jackson raid.</p>

<p> The Justice Department attorneys did not substantially challenge 
testimony by any of the several witnesses who were denied use of 
Illuminati.  They did, however, seek to prevent those witnesses from 
testifying -- by conceding their interests -- after Cayce's compelling 
appearance led off the series of witnesses.</p>

<p> Most of the Justice Department's energies were directed toward 
countering damage claims made by Steve Jackson, whose testimony opened 
the second day of the trial. Most of the day's testimony was devoted to 
a complex give-and-take on accounting issues. Some $2 million is being 
sought in damages.</p>

<p> Justice sought to counter the widely repeated assertion that Steve 
Jackson Games was nearly put out of business by the raid by showing 
that the company was already struggling financially when the raid was 
conducted.  An accountant called by the plaintiffs countered that all 
of Jackson's financial problems had been corrected by a reorganization 
in late 1989.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Steve Jackson Games - Day 3, Steve Jackson Games/Secret Service Wrapup</h2>

<p>by Joe Abernathy</p>

<p> AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret Service 
closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal District Judge Sam 
Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a proper investigation in a 
notorious computer crime crackdown, and went too far in retaining 
custody of seized equipment.</p>

<p> The judge's formal findings in the complex case, which will likely set 
new legal precedents, won't be returned until later.</p>

<p> A packed courtroom sat on the edge of the seat Thursday morning as 
Sparks subjected the Secret Service agent in charge of the 
investigation to a grueling dressing-down.</p>

<p> The judge's rebuke apparently convinced the Department of Justice to 
close its defense after calling only that one of the several government 
witnesses on hand. Attorney Mark Battan entered subdued testimony 
seeking to limit the award of monetary damages.</p>

<p> Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in 
charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1, 1990, 
that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke over the 
Service's poor investigation and abusive computer seizure policies. 
While the Service has seized dozens of computers since the crackdown 
began in 1990, this is the first case to challenge the practice.</p>

<p> "The Secret Service didn't do a good job in this case. We know no 
investigation took place. Nobody ever gave any concern as to whether 
(legal) statutes were involved. We know there was damage," Sparks said 
in weighing damages.</p>

<p> The lawsuit, brought by Steve Jackson Games of Austin, said that the 
seizure of three computers violated the Privacy Protection Act, which 
provides First Amendment protections against seizing a publisher's 
works in progress. The lawsuit further said that since one of the com 
uters was being used to run a bulletin board system containing private 
electronic mail, the seizure violated the Electronic Communications 
Privacy Act in regards to the 388 callers of the Illuminati BBS.</p>

<p> Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin 
science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never suspected of 
a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal research to establish 
a criminal connection between the firm and the suspected illegal 
activities of an employee, or to determine that the company was a 
publisher. Indeed, agents testified that they were not even trained in 
the Privacy Protection Act at the special Secret Service school on 
computer crime.</p>

<p> "How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what Steve 
Jackson Games did, what it was?" asked Sparks. "An hour?</p>

<p> "Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to Steve 
Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything taken?</p>

<p> "Did you read the article in <cite>Business Week</cite> magazine</p>
where it had a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying
citizen -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?</p>

<p> "Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material could 
harm Steve Jackson economically?"</p>

<p> Foley replied, "No, sir," but the judge offered his own answer.</p>

<p> "You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go out 
and hire a lawyer and sue you."</p>

<p> More than $200,000 has been spent by the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>
in bringing the case to trial. The EFF was founded by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/K/MitchKapor.html">Mitchell Kapor</a>
amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large part by the Secret 
Service computer crime crackdown.</p>

<p> "The dressing-down of the Secret Service for their behavior is a major 
vindication of what we've been saying all along, which is that there 
were outrageous actions taken against Steve Jackson that hurt his 
business and sent a chilling effect to everyone using bulletin boards, 
and that there were larger principles at stake," said Kapor, contacted 
at his Cambridge, Mass., office.</p>

<p> "We're very happy with the way the case came out," said Shari Steele, 
who attended the case as counsel for the EFF. "That session with the 
judge and Tim Foley is what a lawyer dreams about."</p>

<p> That session seemed triggered by a riveting cross-examination of Foley 
by Pete Kennedy, Jackson's attorney.</p>

<p> Kennedy forced Foley to admit that the search warrant did not meet even 
the Service's own standards for a search-and-seizure, and did not 
establish that Jackson Games was suspected of being involved in any 
illegal activity.</p>

<p> "Agent Foley, it's been almost three years. Has Chris Goggans been 
indicted? Has Loyd Blankenship been indicted? Has Loyd Blankenship's 
computer been returned to him?"</p>

<p> The purported membership of Jackson Games employee Blankenship in the 
Legion of Doom hacker's group triggered the raids that day on Jackson 
Games, Blankenship's home, and that of Goggans, a Houstonian who at the 
time was a University of Texas student. No charges have been filed, 
although the computer seized from Blankenship's home -- containing his 
wife's dissertation -- never has been returned.</p>

<p> After the cross-examination, Sparks questioned Foley on a number of key 
details before and after the raid, focusing on the holes in the search 
warrant, why Jackson was not allowed to copy his work in progress after 
it was seized, and why his computers were not returned after the Secret 
Service analyzed them, a process completed before the end of March.</p>

<p> "The examination took seven days, but you didn't give Steve Jackson's 
computers back for three months. Why?" asked an incredulous Sparks. "So 
here you are, with three computers, 300 floppy disks, an owner who was 
asking for it back, his attorney calling you, and what I want to know 
is why copies of everything couldn't be given back in days. Not months.
Days.</p>

<p> "That's what makes you mad about this case."</p>

<p> The Justice Department contended that Jackson Games is a manufacturer, 
and that only journalistic organizations can call upon the Privacy 
Protection Act. It contended that the ECPA was not violated because 
electronic mail is not "intercepted" when a BBS is seized. This 
argument rests on a narrow definition of interception.</p>

<h1>Steve Jackson and the Libertarian Party</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JayManifold.html">Jay Manifold</a> of
the Libertarian Party of Texas:</p>

<p>This afternoon I spoke with <a
href="/revolution/by_name/J/SteveJackson.html">Steve Jackson</a>,
proprietor of Steve Jackson
Games in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Austin.html">Austin</a>
and plaintiff of a successful lawsuit against the Secret
Service earlier this year.  Mr Jackson's business was ransacked by
Treasury Department goons during the infamous "Hacker Crackdown" of 
1990.  He was already well-known in the "gaming community" and became
familiar to computer users nationwide after this incident.  The trial
was covered in the mainstream press, and the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation assisted in his defense.  He won $50,000 in damages, and each
employee whose private e-mail was read by the Feds after the raid was
awarded $1,000.  For more information about his case, you may wish to
read Bruce Sterling's <cite>The Hacker Crackdown</cite> or almost any recent
issue of <cite>2600</cite> magazine.</p>

<p>Steve, like most of his employees, is a Libertarian. He identifies with us
strongly. Steve offered to assist us with publications, which is his area of
expertise: the games his company publishes involve lengthy hard-copy texts of
rules and scenarios.  His availability is limited, but for certain
one-time-only efforts his assistance may prove invaluable.</p>

<p>One sobering point: in the e-mail message I sent to Steve on Friday to
let him know I'd be calling, I stated: "I believe that your recent
experiences have entailed some of the most egregious violations of
Consitutional rights ever suffered by Texans."  On the phone today, 
Steve said he doesn't agree --- because he's still alive, and they 
didn't burn the place down.</p>

<title>Export Controls Lawsuit</title>
<!-- Place: USA; Berkeley, California; San Francisco, California (USA) -->

	suit filed February 1995;
	refusal to dismiss April 1996;

<h1>Export Controls Ruled Unconstitutional</h1>

<p>The U.S. government considers
<a href="index.html">encryption technology</a> a munition,
placing it under the same export controls as bombs. These controls
have a strong chilling effect on academic freedom, requiring
researchers to register as international arms dealers and obtain
licenses in order to publish and discuss cryptographic research.
Penalties for violations include up to ten years in prison and up
to $1 million in fines.</p>

<p>In December 1996, a federal judge ruled current restrictions
unconstitutional.</p>

<p>In 1993, University of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> at
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Berkeley.html">Berkeley</a>
graduate student Daniel Bernstein was told by the State Department
that he could not publish his encryption program on the Internet
without a munitions license. In February 1995 Bernstein, along with the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>,
sued the U.S. Department of Justice, arguing that export controls are
an unconsitutional prior restraint of speech.</p>

<p>The Justice Department requested that the suit be dismissed,
arguing that computer software code is not speech, and that the
courts do not have jurisdiction over national security. In April 1996,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanFrancisco.html">San
Francisco</a>, California U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel
refused, ruling that software code is speech and while the court cannot
address case-by-case rulings regarding national security it can address
broader issues. "This court can find no meaningful difference between
a computer language, and German or French," wrote Patel in her opinion.</p>

<p>In December 1996, Patel ruled that export restrictions then in place were
"an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment."
However, it is unclear whether the ruling allows encryption software to
be exported, or only a description of the algorithms. Further, since
it only applies to restrictions in effect at the time of the ruling,
the federal government may ignore the ruling and wait for another
challenge to slightly different rules that went into effect in January
1997.</p>

<p>Bernstein now teaches mathematics at the University of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illionois</a> at
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>.</p>

<h1>The Story of PGP</h1>

<p>[Written on March 2nd, this is appearing in the April 1995, editions of
<cite>MicroTimes</cite>, with total circulation exceeding 230,000 in
California.]</p>

<p>(c)1995 <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/JimWarren.html">Jim Warren</a>.
Permission herewith granted to redistribute-in-full for any nonprofit use.</p>

<p> I write this today, March 2nd, because I envision the possibility of
somehow being enjoined from speaking or writing about this, by a federal
grand jury in San Jose, next Tuesday.</p>

<h2>Subpoena follows op-ed</h2>

<p>On Wednesday, February 22nd, an op-ed piece that I wrote appeared in the
San Jose <cite>Mercury News</cite>, captioned, "Encryption could stop computer
crackers." In the wake of massive Internet break-ins, I urged adopting
nationwide, standardized, by-default, end-to-end data-communications and
file encryption using the most-secure scrambling technologies that are
publicly known and published worldwide. I criticized the FBI and NSA
(National Security Agency) for zealously - and successfully - opposing all
such protection, thus seriously endangering innocent citizens and
law-abiding businesses.</p>

<p>On February 26th, a similar op-ed of mine appeared in the Sunday
edition of the combined San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite> and San Francisco
<cite>Chronicle</cite>,
emphasizing the unnecessary danger and billions of dollars of losses
resulting from the government's preoccupation with protecting and
greatly-enhancing its eavesdropping capabilities.</p>

<p>Three days later, two U.S. Customs Special Agents appeared at my
home, unannounced, and soon handed me a federal grand jury subpoena. I am,
"commanded to appear and testify before the Grand Jury of the United States
District Court," on March 7th.</p>

<p> The subpoena was dated February 27th - the first workday after the Sunday
Examiner's op-ed piece.</p>

<p>Whoever said government is inefficient?</p>

<h2>Interview recording prohibited</h2>

<p>The agents - two pleasant, businesslike young women - said they were here
about <a href="/revolution/by_name/Z/PhilZimmermann.html">Phil Zimmermann</a>
 and his encryption software known as PGP, "Pretty Good Privacy."</p>

<p>I laughed and said, "Oh - okay, come on in," and led them up to my
office, grabbing a tape-recorder along the way.</p>

<p>I sat down and - prominently turning on the recorder - said,
without being confrontational, that I'd like to record the interview.</p>

<p>Woppps! - flag on the play. They said they would want to take a copy of the
tape with them when they left. That was fine with me, so I turned off my
recorder and went for a second recorder from my car.</p>

<p>Drat! - I wish I'd left the recorder running, because when I
returned, they had decided they needed approval from Assistant U.S.
Attorney Bill Keane, the AUSA in charge of investigating Zimmermann and
PGP.</p>

<p>They called Keane. He was out. They left a message, then said that
- in the absence of his approval - they would have to forego the interview,
and made motions to leave. I was curious about what they wanted, and it
occurred to me that I probably couldn't record my testimony before the
grand jury, anyway. So after some discussion, we agreed not to record. In
the process, they offered to allow me to copy their interview notes - which
I thought was a rather-neat show of good faith.</p>

<p>However, before we began, the senior agent looked at me with a
moment of clear hesitancy and suspicion, and asked several times that I
verify that our conversation was not being recorded. I did, pointing out
that it would be a criminal misdemeanor - in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> - if I recorded
them in this private place without their knowledge.</p>

<p>Part-way through the interview, Keane returned his agent's call. I
asked if he say why we couldn't record the interview, with both of us
having a tape. He said only that he didn't wish to have it done.</p>

<p>Apparently we citizens aren't the only ones who are paranoid.</p>

<h2>Realworld Big Brother</h2>

<p>The interview was relaxed, candid and cordial. The agents said they were
just seeking the facts of what actually happened - to wit:</p>

<p> On April 10, 1991, shortly after the Gulf War, a message from
WHMurray@DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL cascaded across the computer nets, warning
about one sentence in buried in a massive "anti-terrorism" bill authored by
Senators Biden and DeConcini. Their Senate Bill 266 declared, "It is the
sense of Congress that providers of electronic communications services and
manufacturers of electronic communications service equipment shall ensure
that communications systems permit the government to obtain the plain text
contents of voice, data, and other communications when appropriately
authorized by law."</p>

<p>Bill Murray, then a computer-security consultant to the NSA, wrote:</p>

<p>"The referenced language requires that manufacturers build
trap-doors into all cryptographic equipment and that providers of
confidential channels reserve to themselves, their agents, and assigns the
ability to read all traffic.</p>

<p>"Are there readers of this list that believe that it is possible
for manufacturers of crypto gear to include such a mechanism and also to
reserve its use to those "appropriately authorized by law" to employ it?</p>

<p>"Are there readers of this list who believe that providers of
electronic communications services can reserve to themselves the ability to
read all the traffic and still keep the traffic 'confidential' in any
meaningful sense?</p>

<p>"Is there anybody out there who would buy crypto gear or
confidential services from vendors who were subject to such a law?</p>

<p>"David Kahn asserts that the sovereign always attempts to reserve
the use of cryptography to himself.  Nonetheless, if this language were to
be enacted into law, it would represent a major departure. An earlier
Senate went to great pains to assure itself that there were no trapdoors in
the DES [federally-adopted Data Encryption Standard]. Mr. Biden and Mr.
DeConcini want to mandate them.</p>

<p>"The historical justification of such reservation has been
"national security;" just when that justification begins to wane, Mr. Biden
wants to use "law enforcement." Both justifications rest upon appeals to
fear.</p>

<p>"In the United States the people, not the Congress, are sovereign;
it should not be illegal for the people to have access to communications
that the government cannot read. We should be free from unreasonable search
and seizure; we should be free from self-incrimination.</p>

<p>"The government already has powerful tools of investigation at its
disposal; it has demonstrated precious little restraint in their use.</p>

<p>"Any assertion that all use of any such trap-doors would be only
"when appropriately authorized by law" is absurd on its face.  It is not
humanly possible to construct a mechanism that could meet that requirement;
any such mechanism would be subject to abuse.</p>

<p>"I suggest that you begin to stock up on crypto gear while you can
still get it."</p>

<p> The net went ballistic over this Orwellian mandate.</p>

<h2>PGP - Pretty Good Privacy</h2>

<p>Prior to this, <a href="/revolution/by_name/Z/PhilZimmermann.html">Phil
Zimmermann</a>, a sometime cryptographer and small computer
consultant near the University of Colorado in Boulder, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/">Colorado</a>, had been
developing a PC implementation of public-key encryption, as described in the
open literature, published worldwide more than a decade earlier. He had idle
thoughts of possibly making it available as shareware, perhaps for
educational purposes for fellow crypto hobbyists. He called it, "PGP" -
Pretty Good Privacy.</p>

<p>But public-key crypto using any reasonably-robust key-sizes is
reputed to be uncrackable. And intentionally building a back-door into a
beautiful crypto implementation is about like welding a tractor tire on the
back of a classic '63 Corvette - obscene!</p>

<p>

<p>Kelly Goen, located in the San Francisco Bay area, was also interested in
crypto. He and Zimmermann became acquainted - as is common among technoids
with similar interests. In that context, Zimmermann apparently gave Goen a
copy of PGP - also common behavior among us propeller-heads.</p>

<h2>S. 266 goads guerrilla crypto</h2>

<p>When Murray's message flashed across the nets, thousands of us were
infuriated - and frightened. In the wake of the Gulf War, S. 266 seemed
likely to become law, permanently prohibiting Americans from having the
privacy protection that technology could easily provide.</p>

<p>S. 266 would also prohibit PGP - at least in any respectable form.</p>

<p>So - with more than a little of the spirit of freedom that is the
heritage of all Americans - and the help citizens "stock up on crypto gear
while you still can," it was decided to make this privacy protection tool
available to everyone, immediately. Goen would upload copies - fully
annotated sources, binaries and documentation - to as many BBSs (bulletin
board systems) and host-computers around the United States as possible.
Zimmermann agreed - especially since S. 266 would soon outlaw PGP.</p>

<h2>A night-time call</h2>

<p>Goen sent email to <cite>MicroTimes</cite> on May 24th, saying, "the intent
here is to invalidate the socalled trap-door provision of the new senate bill
coming down the pike before it has a possibility of making it into law." He
said we could publish details about it, "provided of course mum is the word
until the code is actually flooded to the networks at large."</p>

<p>He also called me - as a <cite>MicroTimes</cite> columnist, and
probably because I had organized the recently-completed First Conference on
Computers, Freedom & Privacy, or maybe because of my comments on the net
critical of the S. 266 mandate.</p>

<p>I had several conversations with Goen, and later with Zimmermann -
who seemed more passive about the project. Now, four years after the fact, this
is re-constructed from random notes I took at the time, plus my recollections -
some of which remain quite vivid.</p>

<h2>D-Day, defending freedom</h2>

<p>On a weekend around the first of June, Goen began uploading complete PGP to
systems around the U.S. He called several times, telling me his progress.</p>

<p>He was driving around the Bay Area with a laptop, acoustic coupler
and a cellular phone. He would stop at a pay-phone; upload a number of
copies for a few minutes, then disconnect and rush off to another phone
miles away.</p>

<p>He said he wanted to get as many copies scattered as widely as
possible around the nation before the government could get an injunction
and stop him.</p>

<p> I thought he was being rather paranoid. In light of the following, perhaps
he was just being realistic.</p>

<h2>Government counter-attacks</h2>

<p>About two years after the PGP uploads, the government began threatening to
prosecute Zimmermann for illegal trafficking in munitions - cryptography.
[He was first visited by U.S. Customs agents on Feb. 17, 1993.]  For more
than two years, they have been investigating whether he "exported" PGP. It
appears at press-time that they will probably prosecute him.</P>

<p>The allegation seems to be that, since he permitted someone else -
over whom he had no control anyway - to upload PGP to some Internet hosts
inside the United States, Zimmermann thus exported this controlled
munition!</p>

<p>This ignores the fact that most of those same Internet hosts also
have DES crypto software from AT&T, Sun, SCO and BSD, part of their
standard domestic Unix systems. The DES is under the same export
prohibition as PGP. The same is true for RSA's public-key crypto tools that
reside on thousands of Internet hosts around the nation.</p>

<p>This bizarre lunacy also ignores that public-key was published,
worldwide, fifteen years ago, and is available from numerous foreign
software competitors including entrepreneurs in former Easter Bloc
countries - as is the DES.</p>

<p> Based on what they told me at the time and everything I've learned since
then:</p>

<p>Zimmermann never even uploaded PGP files for public access.</p>

<p>Goen studiously limited his uploads to U.S. systems, as permitted
by law and routinely done with identically-regulated AT&T and RSA software.</p>

<p>They certainly didn't care about exporting PGP. Hell, most of the
rest of the world already purchases public-key products from numerous
vendors except U.S. companies.</p>

<p> They did want to pre-empt S. 266 before it became law - just as millions of
people do all the time regarding all sorts of pending legislation. And the
offending mandate was later deleted from S. 266, anyway.</p>

<p>Zimmermann and Goen wanted to protect this nation's citizens. S. 266
wasn't threatening other nation's citizens; it was threatening Americans!</p>

<h2>Why the persecution?</h2>

<p>Some apologists say the government is just trying to clarify the law.
Bull!</p>

<p>If that's what they want, they should investigate and prosecute
AT&T or Sun or SCO or RSA. Each makes millions peddling systems to U.S.
Internet host-owners that include identically-controlled crypto modules,
particularly including RSA public-key packages that are at-least as
powerful as PGP.</p>

<p>But thugs don't pick on targets that can defend themselves. Goons
go for the frail and weak and helpless - like Phil Zimmermann.</p>

<p>Maybe this is a rogue prosecutor trying to make a name for himself. But
apparently Keane can't seek a grand jury indictment for this "crime"
without clearance from the Department of Justice in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington</a>.</p>

<p> Maybe it's just our government wasting thousands of staff hours and
millions of dollars to publicly flog Zimmermann as a lesson to any other
pissant citizen who dares to do what AT&T, Sun and RSA can do with
impunity.</p>

<p> This appears to be nothing less than an arrogant, oppressive government
using all of its might and all of its power to flail and torture one poor
citizen, to teach him that he is dirt and intimidate everyone else.</p>

<p> Is this what our nation has become?  Is this the America we want?</P>

<h2>Coincidental subpoena?</h2>

<p>As a footnote, I must say that my initial assumption was that the agents'
arrival two days after my op-ed piece appeared was simply coincidental -
that they were just-now getting around to tying-up loose ends of this
wasteful multi-year investigation. They said they were responding to a
letter I had sent to the grand jury a year or two earlier, when I first
heard they were investigating Zimmermann.</p>

<p>As I write this, and try to maintain some slight semblance of
reason, about half the time I think the timing was accidental - and half
the time I think I'm being naive.</p>

<h2>A frightening experience</h2>

<p>But I gotta tell ya, I awakened hours before dawn this morning, wondering
if somehow I was going to be the next victim of this governmental
obscenity. The government's stated policy is to attack opponents with
overpowering force. They are certainly doing that to Zimmermann.</p>

<p>I feel threatened and intimidated - and furious and outraged that
it should be happening in <em>my</em> nation, prosecuted by <em>my</em>
government.</p>

<p> I cry for what Phil Zimmermann must be going through. He had little
financial resources to begin with; this has already cost him, dearly. For
almost two years, he has been under the horrifying threat of wasting all of
his assets including his home, just to defend himself against the
outrageous abuse of a federal government that will go to any expense to
"win."</p>

<p>And if Zimmermann loses, he goes to prison for years of mandatory
incarceration. When he comes out, his young daughter will be a teen-ager.
All because he dared to write a cryptographic program that the government
couldn't crack, that someone else made available to U.S. citizens.</p>

<p> If there is any justice remaining in this nation, this screams out for
immediate redress!</p>

defense fund in care of his attorney, Phil DuBois, 2305 Broadway, Boulder

<h1>Feds Won't Prosecute PGP Creator</h1>

<p>January 11, 1996 public email message from <a
href="/revolution/by_name/Z/PhilZimmermann.html">Phil Zimmermann</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My lead defense lawyer, Phil Dubois, received a fax this morning from
the Assistant US Attorney in Northern District of California, William
Keane.  The letter informed us that I "will not be prosecuted in connection
with the posting to USENET in June 1991 of the encryption program
Pretty Good Privacy.  The investigation is closed."</p>

<p>This brings to a close a criminal investigation that has spanned the
last three years.  I'd like to thank all the people who helped us in
this case, especially all the donors to my legal defense fund. Apparently,
the money was well-spent.  And I'd like to thank my very capable defense
team:  Phil Dubois, Ken Bass, Eben Moglen, Curt Karnow, Tom Nolan, and 
Bob Corn-Revere.  Most of the time they spent on the case was pro-bono.  
I'd also like to thank Joe Burton, counsel for the co-defendant.</p>

<p>There are many others I can thank, but I don't have the presence of mind
to list them all here at this moment.  The medium of email cannot express
how I feel about this turn of events.</p>

the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.</p>

<p> The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.</p>

<p> For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.</p>

<p> Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.</p>

<p> A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has
been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.</p>

<p> This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. </p>

<p> A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the
"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique
"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.</p>

<p> The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans.</p>

<p> To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings.</p>

<p> The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;</p>
<li><p>the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
calls and data, under proper court or other legal
order, when necessary to protect our citizens;</p>
<li><p>the effective and timely use of the most modern
technology to build the National Information
Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
the competitiveness of American industry in the global
marketplace; and </p>
<li><p>the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
high technology products.</p>
</ul>

<p> The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.</p>

<p> The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice.</p>

<p> Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law.</p>

<p> Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. 
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.  </p>

Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.</p>

<title>Clipper Chip Q & A</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: from press release April 16, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The White House's Clipper Chip Q & A</h1>

<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE</p>

<p> Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?</p>

<p> A:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.</p>

<p> Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message?</p>

<p> A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system.</p>

<p> Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?</p>

<p> A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key-escrow data banks.</p>

<p> Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  </p>

<p> A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.</p>

<p> Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?</p>

<p> A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.</p>

<p> Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?</p>

<p> A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.</p>

<p> Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?</p>

<p> A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.</p>

<p> Q:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?</p>

<p> A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,
<a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>, and will
sell the chip to encryption device
manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
to other vendors in the future.</p>

<p> Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? </p>

<p> A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.</p>

<p> Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?</p>

<p> A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.</p>

<p> The Administration is not saying, "since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a
     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper
     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.</p>

<p> Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?  </p>

<p> A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.</p>

<p> Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?</p>

<p> A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The
     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of these products.</p>

<title>Clipper Chip Critique</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: chip announced April 16, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Critique of the Clipper Chip</h1>

<p> April 1993 letter from Sameer Parekh (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:zane@genesis.mcs.com">zane@genesis.mcs.com</a>):</p>

<p>The Clinton administration on Friday unveiled their plan for
establishing a standard data encryption system for voice communications.
President Clinton says that he wants to bring the United States
into the twenty-first century. This proposal is bringing us to 1984. I
will mention first the technical reasons why the system is inadequate.</P>

<p>The encryption algorithim is classified; only a select group of
people will be allowed to examine the algorithim for flaws. The members
of the cryptographic community continually and persistently emphasize
that the only way to ensure security in a cryptographic system is to
have as many people as possible analyze and try to break it for as long
as possible. A system which has been examined by a small segment of the
population should not be trusted.</p>

<p> Release of the algorithim is crucial to verification of a good
encryption method. The earlier Data Encryption Standard (DES) for data
storage encryption was a very strong standard; the academic world
examined it and after a number of months found weaknesses, spawning the
now-standard "triple-DES" system which is more secure.</p>

<p> From what little is known about the encryption system, it
appears to be a weak system. Such a weak system lends itself to
easy decryption by an unauthorized party. It would lend a false sense of
security to laypersons in the field who do not realize that a key of
such simplicity could be cracked easily by any talented criminal. The
necessarily secure communications between a doctor and his patient could
be thus breached. If the system were strong, the government would use it
for internal use, but according to the AT&T release, the government will
not be using the same chip which is marketed to consumers.</p>

<p>Apart from the technical flaws in the system, there are many
political problems with this big brother proposal. First, there is the
assumption that the government has a right to spy on its own citizens.
The proposal for this wiretap chip includes the registration of keys
with two escrow agencies.  This proposal is purported to allow law
enforcement to keep track of "terrorists" and "drug-dealers." The first
flaw in this key-escrow system is that no self-respecting criminal will
use a cryptography system which can be easily tapped by law enforcement
officials -- they will use strong cryptography. The only people who
may end up using the wiretap encryption system will be law-abiding
laypeople who don't fully understand cryptography. (Law-abiding citizens
who do understand cryptography will use strong cryptography to preserve
their privacy from a talented criminal.) </p>

<p> The proposal states that in order to obtain the key of a wiretap
chip user a law enforcement agency must first establish that they have a
valid interest in the key. Translated out of legalese, that means that
all a government agency will have to do to get access to all of the
private communications, for example, between a lawyer and her client
will be to fill out the necessary forms. Registering cryptographic keys
with the government is similar to giving the IRS the keys to your house
and filing cabinet. A criminal who wants access to the communications
between a priest and confessor needs only to find a corrupt judge.</p>

<p> The chip is being manufactured exclusively by one company. The
release stated that the Attorney shall request (i.e. coerce)
telecommunication product manufacturers to use this product.  This
aspect of the system is a government-mandated monopoly. Such monopolies
result in high prices and the elimination of market forces which drive
the improvement of technology. (One needs only look at the state of the
Soviet Union to see how the lack of market forces affects consumer
technology.)</p>

<p> The system exposes our President's hypocrisy because of his
campaign promise to protect womens' rights to privacy and that he will
see a Supreme Court nominee who believes that the Bill of Rights
guarantees a right to privacy. By mandating a weak cryptosystem he is
reneging on his promise to provide privacy rights to the nation's
citizenry. If Clinton supported a right to privacy to limit government
interference with regards to abortions, he must limit government
interference with regards to communication.</p>

<p> Another element of Clinton's hypocrisy lies in his promise to
reduce the budget deficit. By introducing additional responsibilities
for government agencies (keeping track of the millions of keys
registered in escrow) he is only using our tax dollars to invade our
privacy, tax dollars which are better spent lowering the budget deficit.</p>

<p> What I fear most from the proposal is that if the wiretap chip
becomes the standard, strong cryptography will be declared illegal. If
such is the case, then only criminals will have access to strong
cryptography. As I have stated above -- the wiretap chip will not be used
by criminals because of the obvious flaws in the crypto-system --
criminals will use strong crypto, while law-abiding citizens will have
to use a system which can be easily defeated by any criminal.</p>

<p> Strong cryptography already exists for data communications, for
<em>free</em>. Strong cryptography for voice communications for free is only
a few months away for people who own a personal computer. There is no
way that making strong cryptography illegal will stop it -- it will only
turn otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals.</p>

<title>Clipper Chip Petition</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: early 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Electronic Petition to Stop the Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>In response to the White House's Clipper chip proposal, <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/CPSR.html">Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility</a> (CPSR) organized an electronic
petition to urge Clinton to withdraw the proposal.</p>

<p>Petition "signers" sent a message to Clipper.petition@cpsr.org with the
message "I oppose Clipper."</p>

<p>CPSR maintains <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://cpsr.org/dox/clipper.html">more information about Clipper</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The CPSR Petition</h2>

<p>The President<br>
The White House<br>
Washington, DC  20500<br></p>

<p> Dear Mr. President:</p>

<p> We are writing to you regarding the "Clipper" escrowed encryption
proposal now under consideration by the White House.  We wish to
express our concern about this plan and similar technical standards
that may be proposed for the nation's communications infrastructure.</p>

<p> The current proposal was developed in secret by federal agencies
primarily concerned about electronic surveillance, not privacy
protection.  Critical aspects of the plan remain classified and thus
beyond public review.</p>

<p> The private sector and the public have expressed nearly unanimous
opposition to Clipper.  In the formal request for comments conducted
by the Department of Commerce last year, less than a handful of
respondents supported the plan.  Several hundred opposed it.</p>

<p> If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that hope to develop
new products will face extensive government obstacles. Cryptographers
who wish to develop new privacy enhancing technologies will be
discouraged.  Citizens who anticipate that the progress of technology
will enhance personal privacy will find their expectations
unfulfilled.</p>

<p> Some have proposed that Clipper be adopted on a voluntary basis
and suggest that other technical approaches will remain viable.  The
government, however, exerts enormous influence in the marketplace, and
the likelihood that competing standards would survive is small.  Few
in the user community believe that the proposal would be truly
voluntary.</p>

<p> The Clipper proposal should not be adopted.  We believe that if
this proposal and the associated standards go forward, even on a
voluntary basis, privacy protection will be diminished, innovation
will be slowed, government accountability will be lessened, and the
openness necessary to ensure the successful development of the
nation's communications infrastructure will be threatened.</p>

<p> We respectfully ask the White House to withdraw the Clipper
proposal.</p>

<title>EFF Fights Clipper Chip</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: February 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>EFF Opposes Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">Electonic Frontier
Foundation</a> (EFF) opposed the Clinton administration's
Clipper Chip proposal by supporting Rep. Maria Cantwell's bill, <img
src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.eff.org/ftp/eff/Legislation/Bills_by_sponsor/cantwell_hr3627.bill">H.R.
3627</a>, to liberalize control of encryption technology.</p>

<p>Supporters on the net could send e-mail to cantwell@eff.org with the subject "I
support HR 3627" and a body expressing reasons for such support. EFF printed
out the messages and gave them to Rep. Cantwell. The Cantwell bill was never
passed, and Cantwell lost her re-election bid in 1994.</p>

<p>From a February 1994 message by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/B/JerryBerman.html">Jerry Berman</a>,
Executive Director of EFF:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Friday, February 4, 1994, the Administration announced that it
plans to proceed on every front to make the Clipper Chip encryption scheme
a national standard, and to discourage the development and sale of
alternative powerful encryption technologies. If the government succeeds
in this effort, the resulting blow to individual freedom and privacy could
be immeasurable ...</p>

<p> Rep. Cantwell introduced H.R. 3627 in the House of Representatives on
November 22, 1993.  H.R. 3627 would amend the Export Control Act to move
authority over the export of nonmilitary software with encryption
capabilities from the Secretary of State (where the intelligence community
traditionally has stalled such exports) to the Secretary of Commerce. The
bill would also invalidate the current license requirements for
nonmilitary software containing encryption capablities, unless there is
substantial evidence that the software will be diverted, modified or
re-exported to a military or terroristic end-use ...</p>

<p> We've been fighting Clipper Chip and Digital Telephony in the policy arena
and will continue to do so. But there's another way to fight those
initiatives, and that's to make sure that powerful alternative encryption
technologies are in the hands of any citizen who wants to use them. The
government hopes that, by pushing the Clipper Chip in every way short of
explicitly banning alternative technologies, it can limit your choices for
secure communications.</p>

<title>Safire Criticizes Clipper Chip</title>

<h1>Sink the Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>Columnist William Safire attacked the Clipper Chip in the February 14,
1994 <cite>New York Times</cite> ("Sink the Clipper Chip").</p>

<p>Safire criticized law enforcement and intelligence officials for using
outdated thinking towards new technology. Safire pointed out that the proposal
would miss its target because "no self-respecting vice overlord or terrorist
or local drug-runner would buy or use clipper-chipped American
telecommunications equipment."</p>

<p>Safire criticized the proposal for violating privacy: "In effect, its
proposal demands we turn over to Washington a duplicate set of keys to our
homes, formerly our castles, where not even the king in olden times could
go."</p>

<p>Safire continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "clipper chip" --- aptly named, as it clips the wings of individual 
liberty --- would encode, for Federal perusal whenever a judge 
rubber-stamped a warrant, everything we say on a phone, everything we 
write on a computer, every order we give to a shopping network or bank 
or 800 or 900 number, every electronic note we leave our spouses or 
dictate to our personal-digit-assistant genies.</p>

<p>Add to that stack of intimate data the medical information derived from 
the national "health security card" Mr. Clinton proposes we all carry. 
Combine it with the travel, shopping and credit data available from all
our plastic cards, along with psychological and student test scores. 
Throw in the confidential tax returns, sealed divorce proceedings, 
welfare records, field investigations for job applications, raw files 
and C.I.A.  dossiers available to the Feds, and you have the individual citizen
standing naked to the nosy bureaucrat.</p>

<h1>Jackboots on the Infobahn</h1>

<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/B/JohnBarlow.html">John Perry Barlow</a></p>

href="mailto:infobot@wired.com">infobot@wired.com</a> with the following
message: "send clipper.index". - The Editors of <cite>Wired</cite>]</p>

<p>On January 11, I managed to schmooze myself aboard Air Force 2. It was 
flying out of LA, where its principal passenger had just outlined his 
vision of the information superhighway to a suited mob of television,
show-biz, and cable types who  fervently hoped to own it one day - if they
could ever figure out what the hell it was.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>
 the speech had 
been wildly encouraging. The administration's program, as announced by Vice 
President Al Gore, incorporated many of the concepts of open competition, 
universal access, and  deregulated common carriage that we'd been pushing 
for the previous year.</p>

<p> But he had said nothing about the future of privacy, except to cite among 
the bounties of the NII its ability to "help law enforcement agencies 
thwart criminals and terrorists who might use advanced telecommunications 
to commit crimes."</p>

<p> On the plane I asked Gore what this implied about administration policy on 
cryptography. He became as noncommittal as a cigar-store Indian. "We'll be 
making some announcements.... I can't tell you anything more." He hurried 
to the front of the  plane, leaving me to troubled speculation.</p>

<p> Despite its fundamental role in assuring privacy, transaction security, and 
reliable identity within the NII, the Clinton administration has not 
demonstrated an enlightenment about cryptography up to par with the rest of 
its digital vision.</p>

<p> The Clipper Chip - which threatens to be either the goofiest waste of 
federal dollars since President Gerald Ford's great Swine Flu program or, 
if actually deployed, a surveillance technology of profound malignancy - 
seemed at first an ugly legacy  of the Reagan-Bush modus operandi. "This is 
going to be our Bay of Pigs," one Clinton White House official told me at 
the time Clipper was introduced, referring to the disastrous plan to invade 
Cuba that Kennedy inherited from Eisenhower.</P>

<p> (Clipper, in case you're just tuning in, is an encryption chip that the 
National Security Agency and FBI hope will someday be in every phone and 
computer in America. It scrambles your communications, making them 
unintelligible to all but their  intended recipients. All, that is, but the 
government, which would hold the "key" to your chip. The key would 
separated into two pieces, held in escrow, and joined with the appropriate 
"legal authority.")</p>

<p> Of course, trusting the government with your privacy is like having a 
Peeping Tom install your window blinds. And, since the folks I've met in 
this White House seem like extremely smart, conscious freedom-lovers - 
hell, a lot of them are Deadheads -  I was sure that after they were fully 
moved in, they'd face down the National Security Agency and the FBI, let 
Clipper die a natural death, and lower the export embargo on reliable 
encryption products.</P>

<p> Furthermore, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology and the 
National Security Council have been studying both Clipper and export 
embargoes since April. Given that the volumes of expert testimony they had 
collected overwhelmingly opposed  both, I expected the final report would 
give the administration all the support it needed to do the right thing.</p>

<p> I was wrong. Instead, there would be no report. Apparently, they couldn't 
draft one that supported, on the evidence, what they had decided to do 
instead.</p>

<h2>The Other Shoe Drops</h2>

<p> On Friday, February 4, the other jackboot dropped. A series of 
announcements from the administration made it clear that cryptography would 
become their very own "<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Bosnia/">Bosnia</a>
of telecommunications" (as one staffer put 
it). It wasn't just that the old  Serbs in the National Security Agency and 
the FBI were still making the calls. The alarming new reality was that the 
invertebrates in the White House were only too happy to abide by them. 
Anything to avoid appearing soft on drugs or terrorism.</p.

<p> So, rather than ditching Clipper, they declared it a Federal Data 
Processing Standard, backing that up with an immediate government order for 
50,000 Clipper devices. They appointed the National Institutes of Standards 
and Technology and the  Department of Treasury as the "trusted" third 
parties that would hold the Clipper key pairs. (Treasury, by the way, is 
also home to such trustworthy agencies as the Secret Service and the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.)</p>

<p> They reaffirmed the export embargo on robust encryption products, admitting 
for the first time that its purpose was to stifle competition to Clipper. 
And they outlined a very porous set of requirements under which the cops 
might get the keys to your  chip. (They would not go into the procedure by 
which the National Security Agency could get them, though they assured us 
it was sufficient.)</p>

<p> They even signaled the impending return of the dread Digital Telephony, an 
FBI legislative initiative requiring fundamental reengineering of the 
information infrastructure; providing wiretapping ability to the FBI would 
then become the paramount  design priority.</p>

<h2>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</h2>

<p> Actually, by the time the announcements thudded down, I wasn't surprised by 
them. I had spent several days the previous week in and around the White 
House.</p>

<p> I felt like I was in another remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. 
My friends in the administration had been transformed. They'd been subsumed 
by the vast mindfield on the other side of the security clearance membrane, 
where dwell the  monstrous bureaucratic organisms that feed on fear. They'd 
been infected by the institutionally paranoid National Security Agency's 
Weltanschauung.</p>

<p> They used all the telltale phrases. Mike Nelson, the White House point man 
on the NII, told me, "If only I could tell you what I know, you'd feel the 
same way I do." I told him I'd been inoculated against that argument during 
Vietnam. (And it does  seem to me that if you're going to initiate a 
process that might end freedom in America, you probably need an argument 
that isn't classified.)</p>

<p> Besides, how does he know what he knows? Where does he get his information? 
Why, the National Security Agency, of course. Which, given its strong 
interest in the outcome, seems hardly an unimpeachable source.</p>

<p> However they reached it, Clinton and Gore have an astonishingly simple 
bottom line, to which even the future of American liberty and prosperity is 
secondary: They believe that it is their responsibility to eliminate, by 
whatever means, the  possibility that some terrorist might get a nuke and 
use it on, say, the World Trade Center. They have been convinced that such 
plots are more likely to ripen to hideous fruition behind a shield of 
encryption.</p>

<p> The staffers I talked to were unmoved by the argument that anyone smart 
enough to steal a nuclear device is probably smart enough to use PGP or 
some other uncompromised crypto standard. And never mind that the last 
people who popped a hooter in the  World Trade Center were able to get it 
there without using any cryptography and while under FBI surveillance.</p>

<p> We are dealing with religion here. Though only ten American lives have been 
lost to terrorism in the last two years, the primacy of this threat has 
become as much an article of faith with these guys as the Catholic 
conviction that human life begins  at conception or the Mormon belief that 
the Lost Tribe of Israel crossed the Atlantic in submarines.</p>

<p> In the spirit of openness and compromise, they invited the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation to submit other solutions to the "problem" of the 
nuclear-enabled terrorist than key escrow devices, but they would not admit 
into discussion the argument that  such a threat might, in fact, be some 
kind of phantasm created by the spooks to ensure their lavish budgets into 
the post-Cold War era.</p>

<p> As to the possibility that good old-fashioned investigative techniques 
might be more valuable in preventing their show-case catastrophe (as it was 
after the fact in finding the alleged perpetrators of the last attack on 
the World Trade Center), they  just hunkered down and said that when 
wiretaps were necessary, they were damned well necessary.</p>

<p> When I asked about the business that American companies lose because of 
their inability to export good encryption products, one staffer essentially 
dismissed the market, saying that total world trade in crypto goods was 
still less than a billion  dollars. (Well, right. Thanks more to the 
diligent efforts of the National Security Agency than to dim sales 
potential.)</p>

<p> I suggested that a more immediate and costly real-world effect of their 
policies would be to reduce national security by isolating American 
commerce, owing to a lack of international confidence in the security of 
our data lines. I said that Bruce  Sterling's fictional data-enclaves in 
places like the Turks and Caicos Islands were starting to look real-world 
inevitable.</p>

<p> They had a couple of answers to this, one unsatisfying and the other scary. 
The unsatisfying answer was that the international banking community could 
just go on using DES, which still seemed robust enough to them. (DES is the 
old federal Data  Encryption Standard, thought by most cryptologists to be 
nearing the end of its credibility.)</p>

<p> More frightening was their willingness to counter the data-enclave future 
with one in which no data channels anywhere would be secure from 
examination by one government or another. Pointing to unnamed other 
countries that were developing their own  mandatory standards and 
restrictions regarding cryptography, they said words to the effect of, 
"Hey, it's not like you can't outlaw the stuff. Look at <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/France/">France</a>."</p>

<p> Of course, they have also said repeatedly - and for now I believe them - 
that they have absolutely no plans to outlaw non-Clipper crypto in the US. 
But that doesn't mean that such plans wouldn't develop in the presence of 
some pending "emergency."  Then there is that White House briefing 
document, issued at the time Clipper was first announced, which asserts 
that no US citizen "as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable 
commercial encryption product."</p>

<p> Now why, if it's an ability they have no intention of contesting, do they 
feel compelled to declare that it's not a right? Could it be that they are 
preparing us for the laws they'll pass after some bearded fanatic has 
gotten himself a surplus nuke  and used something besides Clipper to 
conceal his plans for it?</p>

<p> If they are thinking about such an eventuality, we should be doing so as 
well. How will we respond? I believe there is a strong, though currently 
untested, argument that outlawing unregulated crypto would violate the 
First Amendment, which surely  protects the manner of our speech as clearly 
as it protects the content.</p>

<p> But of course the First Amendment is, like the rest of the Constitution, 
only as good as the government's willingness to uphold it. And they are, as 
I say, in the mood to protect our safety over our liberty.</p>

<p> This is not a mind-frame against which any argument is going to be very 
effective. And it appeared that they had already heard and rejected every 
argument I could possibly offer.</p>

<p> In fact, when I drew what I thought was an original comparison between 
their stand against naturally proliferating crypto and the folly of King 
Canute (who placed his throne on the beach and commanded the tide to leave 
him dry), my government  opposition looked pained and said he had heard 
that one almost as often as jokes about roadkill on the information 
superhighway.</p>

<p> I hate to go to war with them. War is always nastier among friends. 
Furthermore, unless they've decided to let the National Security Agency 
design the rest of the National Information Infrastructure as well, we need 
to go on working closely with  them on the whole range of issues like 
access, competition, workplace privacy, common carriage, intellectual 
property, and such. Besides, the proliferation of strong crypto will 
probably happen eventually no matter what they do.</P>

<p> But then again, it might not. In which case we could shortly find ourselves 
under a government that would have the automated ability to log the time, 
origin and recipient of every call we made, could track our physical 
whereabouts continuously,  could keep better account of our financial 
transactions than we do, and all without a warrant. Talk about crime 
prevention!</p>

<p> Worse, under some vaguely defined and surely mutable "legal authority," 
they also would be able to listen to our calls and read our e-mail without 
having to do any backyard rewiring. They wouldn't need any permission at 
all to monitor overseas calls.</p>

<p> If there's going to be a fight, I'd rather it be with this government than 
the one we'd likely face on that hard day.</p>

<p> Hey, I've never been a paranoid before. It's always seemed to me that most 
governments are too incompetent to keep a good plot strung together all the 
way from coffee break to quitting time. But I am now very nervous about the 
government of the  United States of America.</p>

<p> Because Bill 'n' Al, whatever their other new-paradigm virtues, have 
allowed the very old-paradigm trogs of the Guardian Class to define as 
their highest duty the defense of America against an enemy that exists 
primarily in the imagination - and is  therefore capable of anything.</p>

<p> To assure absolute safety against such an enemy, there is no limit to the 
liberties we will eventually be asked to sacrifice. And, with a Clipper 
Chip in every phone, there will certainly be no technical limit on their 
ability to enforce those  sacrifices.</p>

<h2>Get Congress to Lift the Crypto Embargo</h2>

<p> The administration is trying to impose Clipper on us by manipulating market 
forces. By purchasing massive numbers of Clipper devices, they intend to 
induce an economy of scale which will make them cheap while the export 
embargo renders all  competition either expensive or nonexistent.</p>

<p> We have to use the market to fight back. While it's unlikely that they'll 
back down on Clipper deployment, the Electronic Frontier Foundation 
believes that with sufficient public involvement, we can get Congress to 
eliminate the export embargo.</p>

<p> Rep. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, has a bill (H.R. 3627) before the 
Economic Policy, Trade, and Environment Subcommittee of the House Committee 
on Foreign Affairs that would do exactly that. She will need a lot of help 
from the public. They may not  care much about your privacy in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">DC</a>, but they 
still care about your vote.</p>

<p> Please signal your support of H.R. 3627, either by writing her directly or 
e-mailing her at cantwell@eff.org. Messages sent to that address will be 
printed out and delivered to her office. In the subject header of your 
message, please include the  words "support HR 3627." In the body of your 
message, express your reasons for supporting the bill. You may also express 
your sentiments to Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, the House Committee on 
Foreign Affairs chair, by e-mailing hamilton@eff.org.</p>

<p> Furthermore, since there is nothing quite as powerful as a letter from a 
constituent, you should check the following list of subcommittee and 
committee members to see if your congressional representative is among 
them. If so, please copy them your  letter to Rep. Cantwell.</p>

<p> Economic Policy, Trade, and Environment Subcommittee:</p>

<p> Democrats: Sam Gejdenson (Chair), D-Connecticut; James Oberstar, D-
Minnesota; Cynthia McKinney, D-Georgia; Maria Cantwell, D-Washington; Eric 
Fingerhut, D-Ohio; Albert R. Wynn, D-Maryland; Harry Johnston, D-Florida; 
Eliot Engel, D-New York; Charles Schumer, D-New York.</p>

Gallegly, R-California; Ileana  Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida; David Levy, R-New 
York; Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Florida; Ed Royce, R-California.</p>

<p> BOYCOTT CLIPPER DEVICES AND THE COMPANIES WHICH MAKE THEM.</p>

<p> Don't buy anything with a Clipper Chip in it. Don't buy any product from a 
company that manufactures devices with Big Brother inside. It is likely 
that the government will ask you to use Clipper for communications with the 
IRS or when doing business  with federal agencies. They cannot, as yet, 
require you to do so. Just say no.</p>

<p> LEARN ABOUT ENCRYPTION AND EXPLAIN THE ISSUES TO YOUR UNWIRED FRIENDS</p>

<p> The administration is banking on the likelihood that this stuff is too 
technically obscure to agitate anyone but nerds like us. Prove them wrong 
by patiently explaining what's going on to all the people you know who have 
never touched a computer and  glaze over at the mention of words like 
"cryptography."</p>

<p> Maybe you glaze over yourself. Don't. It's not that hard. For some hands-on 
experience, download a copy of PGP - Pretty Good Privacy - a shareware 
encryption engine which uses the robust RSA encryption algorithm. And learn 
to use it.</p>

<p> GET YOUR COMPANY TO THINK ABOUT EMBEDDING REAL CRYPTOGRAPHY IN ITS PRODUCTS</P>

<p> If you work for a company that makes software, computer hardware, or any 
kind of communications device, work from within to get them to incorporate 
RSA or some other strong encryption scheme into their products. If they say 
that they are afraid to  violate the export embargo, ask them to consider 
manufacturing such products overseas and importing them back into the 
United States. There appears to be no law against that. Yet.</p>

<p> You might also lobby your company to join the Digital Privacy and Security 
Working Group, a coalition of companies and public interest groups - 
including IBM, Apple, Sun, Microsoft, and, interestingly, Clipper phone 
manufacturer AT&T - that is  working to get the embargo lifted.</p>

<p> ENLIST!</p>

<p> Self-serving as it sounds coming from me, you can do a lot to help by 
becoming a member of one of these organizations. In addition to giving you 
access to the latest information on this subject, every additional member 
strengthens our credibility  with Congress.</P>

<p> Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation by writing membership@eff.org.</p>

<p> Join <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/CPSR.html">Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility</a> by e-mailing cpsr.info@cpsr.org. CPSR is also
organizing a protest, to which you can
lend your support by sending e-mail to clipper.petition@cpsr.org with
"I oppose Clipper" in the message body. Ftp/gopher/WAIS to cpsr.org

<p> In his LA speech, Gore called the development of the NII "a revolution." 
And it is a revolutionary war we are engaged in here. Clipper is a last 
ditch attempt by the United States, the last great power from the old 
Industrial Era, to establish  imperial control over cyberspace. If they 
win, the most liberating development in the history of humankind could 
become, instead, the surveillance system which will monitor our 
grandchildren's morality. We can be better ancestors than that.</p>

<title>White House Backs Clipper Chip</title>

<body>

<h1>White House Maintains Support For Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>From the February 14, 1994 <cite>Newsbytes</cite>:</p>

<p> The Administration is trying to back away from remarks by Vice President Al
Gore which might indicate it's retreating from a plan to use "Clipper Chip"
encryption.</p>

<p>... Gore's remarks, made at a National Information Infrastructure Advisory
Committee meeting, which advises the President on the Information
Superhighway, were quickly passed around the Internet, where some interpreted
them as meaning the Administration is seeking a face-saving way out of the
controversy. But Lorraine Voles, a Gore spokeswoman, denied this to
Newsbytes: "He's not off the reservation at all," with the Clipper Chip. "All
the Vice President was trying to do was say we'd look at better ways to do
it," declining to elaborate further.</p>

<p> That could mean offering the decryption keys to different agencies, but
that's unlikely to satisfy opponents ...</p>

<title>Clipper Chip Flaws</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: June 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Flaws in the Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>From p. 60 of the June 13, 1994 <cite>Newsweek</cite>:</p>

<p> ...  The Clipper chip, after all, was invented by the
same government whose space satellite vanished on route to Mars and who
can't delete dead men from its computerized Social Security rolls.  Now
computer scientist Matthew Blaze, 32, of AT&T Bell Labs has found that
Clipper is flawed, too ...</p>

<p> The flaw, finds Blaze, lies in how the encryption system begins a
transmission.  Say a person computer contains the souped-up version of
the Clipper chip on the Tessera card, which fits laptops and many PCs.
Before the computer sends encrypted e-mail, it transmits a 128-bit
string that includes the serial number of its encryption device, a
number identifying which of myriad codes is being used, and digits that
check the first two.  Together, these strings are the chip's LEAF (Law
Enforcement Access Field) .  The receiving computer must recognize the LEAF as
valid before it can decode the message.  The LEAF also tells an
authorized wiretapper which key it needs to decrypt the subsequent
messages.  (Two federal agencies hold the keys to Clipper codes, and
release them only to law-enforcement officials with a court order for a
cybertap.)  Armed with the key, agents easily unscramble the message.
But, Blaze explains in the draft of a paper obtained by Newsweek,
someone who wants to foil eavesdroppers could transmit a rogue LEAF.
When the FBI used the LEAF to retrieve the key to the code, it would
come up with the wrong one.  It would, to be simplistic, substitute A
for 1 and B for 2, when in fact the code used Z for 1 and Y for 2.  The
"decoded" message would be gibberish.</P.

<p> Even the NSA agrees with Blaze's analysis.  But it emphasizes that the
flaw does not apply, for technical reasons, to voice, fax and low-speed
data transmissions.  Blaze's discovery "in no way reduce[s] the chip's
inherent security," said the NSA in a rare statement.  It affects only
computer-to-computer, e-mail encryption -- which is, nevertheless, a big
share of what the government wants to be able to tap.  Also, the NSA
argues that generating rogue LEAFs is "not practical in real-world
applications."  But in fact the process would take, on average, only
half an hour, so anyone with patience and the ability to download a
rogue-LEAF software program could do it, says AT&T security specialist
David Maher.  But there is a greater worry.  "What else might we find,"
asks IBM's Mark Holcomb, "if we were allowed to examine" the encryption
code itself?  NSA has kept it secret, telling industry that it can't be
cracked -- trust us.  After Blaze's discovery, that's going to be a lot
harder to do.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've lost the author and date of the following response:</p>

<p>Presumably, Clipper cannot distinguish between a data stream that
actually represents audio data, and a stream that has already been
pre-encoded.  The result is that the Clipper-processed data stream would
look like a valid sequence of data.  And, in fact, it <em>would be</em> valid.
The only problem is, the government would, at best, only be able to
decrypt the outermost code. This destroys the utility of Clipper
(from the standpoint of the NSA) not only for "high speed and e-mail
encryption, but also for the kinds of low speed data (voice, fax) that
Blaze's new technique is not claimed to work for.</p>

<p>We should not be complacent, however.  Clipper, if it does nothing else
bad, is bad because it <em>identifies</em> the source of a particular data
stream.  To an organization like the NSA, that is <em>extraordinarily</em>
valuable information, even if the data can't be decoded.  What they
really want is for cellular telephones and PCS's (Personal Communication
System) to identify themselves, so that they can trace users.</p>

<title>Clipper Chip Retreat</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: July 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>White House Tones Down Clipper Chip Proposal</h1>

<p>July 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/StantonMcCandlish.html">
Stanton McCandlish</a>:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Clinton Administration announced that it is taking several
large, quick steps back in its efforts to push EES or Clipper
encryption technology.  Vice-President Gore stated in a letter to
Rep. Maria Cantwell, whose encryption export legislation is today being
debated on the House floor, that EES is being limited to voice
communications only.</p>

<p>The EES (Escrowed Encryption Standard using the Skipjack algorithm, and
including the Clipper and Capstone microchips) is a Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) designed by the National Security Agency, and
approved, despite a stunningly high percentage anti-EES public comments on
the proposal, by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  Since
the very day of the announcement of Clipper in 1993, public outcry against
the key "escrow" system has been strong, unwavering and growing rapidly.</p>

<p>What's changed?  The most immediate alteration in the White House's
previously hardline path is an expressed willingness to abandon the EES
for computer applications (the Capstone chip and Tessera card), and push
for its deployment only in telephone technology (Clipper).  The most
immediate effect this will have is a reduction in the threat to the
encryption software market that Skipjack/EES plans posed.  </p>

<p>Additionally, Gore's letter indicates that deployment for even the telephone
application of Clipper has been put off for months of studies, perhaps
partly in response to a draft bill from Sens. Patrick Leahy and Ernest
Hollings that would block appropriation for EES development until many
detailed conditions had been met.</p>

<p>And according to observers such as Brock Meeks (Cyberwire Dispatch) and
Mark Voorhees (Voorhees Reports/Information Law Alert), even Clipper is
headed for a fall, due to a variety of factors including failure in
attempts to get other countries to adopt the scheme, at least one state
bill banning use of EES for medical records, loss of NSA credibility after
a <a href="flaws.html">flaw in the "escrowed" key system</a> was discovered
by Dr. Matt Blaze of Bell Labs, a patent infringement lawsuit threat (dealt
with by buying off the claimant), condemnation of the scheme by a former
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canadian</a> Defense
Minister, world wide opposition to Clipper and the
presumptions behind it, skeptical back-to-back House and Senate hearings on
the details of the Administration's plan, and pointed questions from lawmakers
regarding monopolism and accountability.</p>

<p>[<b>Revolution</b> note: Politicians are sneakier than McCandlish gives
them credit for.  Opportunists used the 1995 <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> federal building
bombing to rush through a Counter-Terrorism Bill that included funding for
Clipper.]</p>

<p>One of the most signigicant concessions in the letter is that upcoming
encryption standards will be "voluntary," unclassified, and exportable,
according to Gore, who also says there will be no moves to tighten export
controls.</p>

<p>[<b>Revolution</b> note: FBI Director <a
href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis Freeh</a> later said he
would seek
a ban on other forms of encryption if criminals don't use Clipper. Since few
criminals would be so foolish as to use Clipper, you can bet on an attempted
encryption ban.]</p>

<p>Though Gore hints at private, rather than governmental, key "escrow," the
Administration does still maintain that key "escrow" is an important part of
its future cryptography policy.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">EFF</a> would like to extend
thanks to all who've participated in our online
campaigns to sink Clipper.  This retreat on the part of the Executive
Branch is due not just to discussions with Congresspersons, or letters
from industry leaders, but in large measure to the overwhelming response from
users of computer-mediated communication - members of virtual communities
who stand a lot to gain or lose by the outcome of the interrelated
cryptography debates.  Your participation and activism has played a key
role, if not the key role, in the outcome thus far, and will be vitally
important to the end game!</p>

<p>Below is the public letter sent from VP Gore to Rep. Cantwell.</p>

<hr>

<p>July 20, 1994<br>
The Honorable Maria Cantwell<br>
House of Representatives<br>
Washington, D.C.,  20515<br></p>

<p> Dear Representative Cantwell:</p>

<p> I write to express my sincere appreciation for your efforts to move
the national debate forward on the issue of information security and export
controls.  I share your strong conviction for the need to develop a
comprehensive policy regarding encryption, incorporating an export policy
that does not disadvantage American software companies in world markets
while preserving our law enforcement and national security goals.</p>

<p> As you know, the Administration disagrees with you on the extent to
which existing controls are harming U.S. industry in the short run and the
extent to which their immediate relaxation would affect national security. 
For that reason we have supported a five-month Presidential study.  In
conducting this study, I want to assure you that the Administration will
use the best available resources of the federal government.  This will
include the active participation of the National Economic Council and the
Department of Commerce.  In addition, consistent with the Senate-passed
language, the first study will be completed within 150 days of passage of
the Export Administration Act reauthorization bill, with the second study
to be completed within one year after the completion of the first.  I want
to personally assure you that we will reassess our existing export controls
based on the results of these studies.  Moreover, all programs with
encryption that can be exported today will continue to be exportable.</p>

<p> On the other hand, we agree that we need to take action this year
to assure that over time American companies are able to include information
security features in their programs in order to maintain their admirable
international competitiveness.  We can achieve this by entering into an new
phase of cooperation among government, industry representatives and privacy
advocates with a goal of trying to develop a key escrow encryption system
that will provide strong encryption, be acceptable to computer users
worldwide, and address our national needs as well.</p>

<p> Key escrow encryption offers a very effective way to accomplish our
national goals,  That is why the Administration adopted key escrow
encryption in the "Clipper Chip" to provide very secure encryption for
telephone communications while preserving the ability for law enforcement
and national security.  But the Clipper Chip is an approved federal
standard for telephone communications and not for computer networks and
video networks.  For that reason, we are working with industry to
investigate other technologies for those applications.</p>

<p> The Administration understands the concerns that industry has
regarding the Clipper Chip.  We welcome the opportunity to work with
industry to design a more versatile, less expensive system.  Such a key
escrow system would be implementable in software, firmware, hardware, or
any combination thereof, would not rely upon a classified algorithm, would
be voluntary, and would be exportable.  While there are many severe
challenges to developing such a system, we are committed to a diligent
effort with industry and academia to create such a system.  We welcome your
offer to assist us in furthering this effort.</p>

<p> We also want to assure users of key escrow encryption products that
they will not be subject to unauthorized electronic surveillance.  As we
have done with the Clipper Chip, future key escrow systems must contain
safeguards to provide for key disclosure only under legal authorization and
should have audit procedures to ensure the integrity of the system.  Escrow
holders should be strictly liable for releasing keys without legal
authorization.</p>

<p> We also recognize that a new key escrow encryption system must
permit the use of private-sector key escrow agents as one option.  It is
also possible that as key escrow encryption technology spreads, companies
may established layered escrowing services for their own products.  Having
a number of escrow agents would give individuals and businesses more
choices and flexibility in meeting their needs for secure communications.</p>

<p> I assure you the President and I are acutely aware of the need to
balance economic an privacy needs with law enforcement and national
security.  This is not an easy task, but I think that our approach offers
the best opportunity to strike an appropriate balance.  I am looking
forward to working with you and others who share our interest in developing
a comprehensive national policy on encryption.  I am convinced that our
cooperative endeavors will open new creative solutions to this critical
problem.</p>

<p> Sincerely, Al Gore</p>

<title>Commercial Key Escrow</title>
<!-- Place: workshop Gaithersberg, Maryland (USA); USA -->
<!-- Time: workshop September 6-7, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Commercial Key Escrow</h1>

<p>In September 1995, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
held a workshop to discuss their Commercial Key Escrow proposal, intended
to reinvigorate the besieged <a href="index.html">Clipper Chip</a> proposal.</p>

<p>The U.S. government's "key escrow" idea is to have encryption products
with built-in back doors for law enforcement. Police would be able to
decrypt any encrypted transmission (telephone conversation, computer disk,
etc.) with their skeleton key.</p>

<p>The original Clipper proposal would have the federal government hold
("escrow") the decryption keys. The newer "Son of Clipper" Commercial Key
Escrow proposal would have private companies hold the keys.</p>

<p>Commercial Key Escrow is subject to the same criticisms as the original
proposal. The proposal is entirely weighted to the benefit of the intelligence
and law enforcement communities, with little respect for business or
individual needs. Strong encryption to evade key escrow is widely available.
Free speech includes speaking encrypted.</p>

<title>Guns in Households</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Half of U.S. Households Own Guns</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My first essential observation is that half the households in the
country possess at least one gun.  So far as I can tell, the first
question about gun ownership in a national probability sample of
U.S. adults was asked in 1959, and similar questions have been asked
dozens of times since.  Over the last 35 years or so that we've
been asking the question, every survey has reported more or less the
same result, namely, that half of all U.S. households own one or
more guns.</p>

<p>Although many people know this to be true, I think many
of the implications of this fact are not well appreciated.  The fact
that the ownership percentage has been effectively constant for
nearly four decades, for example, while at the same time the total
number of guns in circulation has increased rather substantially,
implies that the increasing supply of guns has been absorbed largely
by the purchase of additional guns among households already owning
one or more of them.  Indeed there is fairly substantial and
independent evidence that the average number of guns owned by
persons owning <em>any</em> has increased from about three guns 15 years ago
to approximately four guns today.  I think it is also obvious that
from the viewpoint of public safety, the transition from N to N + 1
guns is considerably less ominous than the transition from no guns
to one gun.</p>

<p>If this first implication is correct, incidentally, it means that
most of the people in the gun shops today buying new firearms
already own guns -- a useful point to keep in mind when pondering
the alleged "cooling off" function to be served by waiting periods
imposed at the point of retail sale.</p>

<p> A second implication is that gun ownership is not deviant
behavior, but rather, normative behavior across vast swaths of the
social landscape.  There are areas of the country where it would be
an odd person indeed who did not own a gun.</p>

<p> Finally, when we attempt to control crime or violence by
controlling the general ownership and use of guns among the public
at large, we are attempting to control the behaviors of a very small
fraction of the population, the violent or criminally-inclined
fraction, by controlling the behaviors and activities of roughly
half the American population, and whatever else might be said about
such an approach, it is certainly not very efficient.</p>

<title>Guns in Circulation</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>200,000,000 Firearms in Circulation in the U.S.</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>The second essential observation on guns in America today is
that there are already something like 200,000,000 firearms in
circulation, give or take a few tens of millions, to be sure.
It has been said, I believe correctly, that firearms are the most
commonly owned pieces of sporting equipment in the United States,
with the exception of pairs of sneakers and running shoes.  It is
not entirely clear just how many acts of gun violence occur in the
United States in any typical year. In recent years, we've been
pushing 40,000 deaths from firearms. There are, in addition to
that, perhaps a few hundred thousand nonfatal, but injurious,
firearms accidents, conceivably 500,000 or 600,000 chargeable firearms
crimes committed every year, and God-knows-how-many instances where
guns are used to intimidate or to prey upon one's fellow human
beings.</p>

<p> Making very generous allowances all around, however, the total
number of acts of accidental and intentional gun violence, whether
fatal or not, whether injurious or not, cannot possibly be more than
a couple of million per annum at the absolute outside.  This
implies, moreover, that the 200,000,000 firearms now circulating
in the U.S. market would be sufficient to sustain gun violence at
the current rate for at least another century, this even assuming
that every gun was used once and only once for some nefarious
purpose, and that all additions to the supply were halted
permanently and at once.  Because of the immensely large number
of firearms already circulating in the U.S. market, the violence-
reductive effects even of fairly draconian gun control measures
might very well not be felt for many decades.</p>

<title>Guns for Recreation</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->

<h1>Most Guns Owned for Recreation</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>A third observation is that most of the 200,000,000 guns that
are out there are owned for what I would consider to be socially
innocuous sport and recreational reasons. About a third of the
guns presently in circulation are handguns, the remainder rifles
and shotguns.  When one asks gun owners why they own guns, various
sport and recreational activities dominate the responses: hunting,
target shooting, collecting, and the like.  Even when the question
is restricted just to handgun owners, about 40% will say they own
the gun for recreational applications, another 40% will say they
own it for self-protection, and the remaining 20% will cite some
job-related reason as the reason for them to own a gun.</p>

<p> Thus, in the majority, I believe gun ownership is a topic more
appropriate to the sociology of leisure than to the criminology or
epidemiology of violence.  Unfortunately, when we seek to control
violence by controlling the general ownership and use of firearms
among the public at large, it at least looks as though we think we
have intuited some direct causal connection between drive-by
shootings in the inner city and squirrel hunting or skeet shooting
in the hinterland.  Or such, in any case, is the implication that
the nation's squirrel hunters and skeet shooters often draw, and
frankly, it's no wonder they sometimes question the motives,
not to mention the sanity, of anybody who would suggest such a
preposterous thing.</p>

<title>Guns for Defense</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->

<h1>Many Guns Owned for Defense</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My fourth observation is that many firearms are also owned for
self-defense against crime, that some are indeed used for that
purpose, and, whether they are actually any safer or not, many
people certainly seem to feel safer when they have a gun.  Findings
have been mentioned this morning from recent work done by my
colleague Gary Kleck at Florida State University that Americans
use guns to protect themselves from crime as often as a couple of
million times a year, a finding that I know the other panelist Dr.
Bordua will discuss in more detail.  If this is true, it's very hard
to square with the common assumption of gun control advocates that
guns are not efficacious as a private defense against crime.</p>

<p> Whatever the true number of self-defensive uses proves to be,
about a quarter of all gun owners, and about 40% of handgun owners
mention defense against crime as the main reason they owned a gun,
and large percentages who give some other main reason will mention
self-defense as a secondary reason.</p>

<p> Gun owners and gun advocates insist that guns provide real
protection, as indeed the panel that preceded us testified, and
indeed as Gary Kleck's findings suggest.  Anti-gun advocates insist
that the sense of security is more illusory than real. But the
fact is practically everything people do to defend against crime
provides only the illusion of security, in that any such measure
can be defeated by a sufficiently clever and motivated criminal.</p>

<p>Most people have realized, no doubt correctly, that the police
cannot protect them from crime.  So people face the need to protect
themselves, and many choose to own a gun along with taking many
other measures for precisely this purpose.  My question is whether
a society that is manifestly incapable of protecting its citizens
from crime really has any right or moral authority to tell people
what they may or may not do to protect themselves.</p>

<title>Retail Firearms Sales</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->

<h1>Bad Guys Don't Buy Guns at Wal-Mart</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My fifth observation is that the bad guys do not obtain their
guns through normal retail channels.  Research on both adult and
juvenile felons and offenders has made it obvious that the illegal
firearms market is dominated overwhelmingly by informal swaps,
trades, and purchases involving family members, friends,
acquaintances, drug dealers, street and black market sources of
various sorts.  It is a pretty rare criminal indeed who attempts
to acquire a gun through a conventional over-the-counter transaction
with a normal retail outlet.</p>

<p> Now, many efforts at gun control pertain to the initial retail
sale of weapons, for example, the prohibition against gun purchases
by people with felony records, or by people with alcohol and drug
abuse histories, or the national five-day waiting period in the
Brady Bill, or various state and local permit and registration laws.</p>

<p> Since felons rarely obtain guns through customary retail
channels, these kinds of controls imposed at the point of retail
sale must necessarily miss the vast majority of criminal firearms
transactions.</p>

<p>Having learned now well more than a decade ago,
incidentally, that the criminal acquisition of guns involves
these informal and hard-to-regulate transfers, average gun owners
often conclude, whether correctly or not, that such measures as
registration, permits, waiting periods, and so on and so forth,
must therefore be intended primarily to keep tabs on them, that
registration or permit requirements are just the first step towards
outright confiscation of all privately held firearms, for example,
or that mandated registration of new gun purchases is an unwarranted
police-state intrusion on the Constitutional rights of law-abiding
citizens.</p>

<p>It doesn't really matter whether they're correct in
this judgement or not, that they reason in this vein, I think,
is sufficient.  It is reasoning in precisely this vein that often
seems bizarre, or even psychotic, to proponents of these kinds of
measures, but it is exactly the style of reasoning, I think, that
raises the stakes in the debate over guns and that accounts for the
white-hot ferocity of that debate today.</p>

<title>Guns for Violence</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->

<h1>Bad Guys Inhabit Violent World</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My sixth observation is that the bad guys inhabit a violent
world.  As such, a gun often spells a life or death difference
to them. If you ask felons, whether adult or juvenile, why they
own guns, why they carry guns, themes of self protection, self-
defense, survival, and so on, dominate their responses.  Very few
of the bad guys say they acquire or carry guns specifically for
offensive or crime-committing purposes, although that is obviously
how many of them get used.  These men live in an extraordinarily
hostile environment.  Many of them come to believe, no doubt
correctly, that their ability to survive in that environment depends
critically on being adequately armed.  "Adequately armed," in this
case, means being better armed than your most likely adversary,
namely the police.  If sheer survival is indeed the issue, then a
gun is a bargain at practically any price.</p>

<p>As James Q. Wilson has recently argued, the largest share of the
gun violence problem results from the wrong people carrying guns at
the wrong time and place.  The survival motive among the bad guys
means exactly that the wrong kinds of people will be carrying guns
pretty much all the time. The evident implication is that the bad
guys have to be disarmed on the streets if rates of gun violence are
to decline, and that, I think, implies a range of interventions
far removed from what gun control advocates have recently urged
on the American population.</p>

<title>Violence Already Illegal</title>

<h1>Bad Guys' Gun Usage Already Illegal</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My seventh observation is that everything the bad guys do with
their guns is already against the law.  That criminals will
generally be indifferent to the law would seem to follow from the
definition of the terms, but it's a lesson that we've had to learn
time and again throughout our history.  As a matter of fact, and as
has already been stated by the panel this morning, gun acquisition
by felons, whether from retail or private sources, for whatever
reason, is already_illegal. Yet obviously felons still acquire
guns.  Since practically everything the bad guys do with their guns,
or do to obtain their guns is already against the law, one is
entitled to wonder whether there is some new law that we haven't
yet thought up that we can somehow pass that will persuade them to
stop it.</p>

<title>Demand for Guns</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->

<h1>Demand for Guns Creates Own Supply</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My eighth observation, is a theoretical observation from my
colleagues in the Department of Economics.  Demand creates its own
supply.  This is sometimes called the First Law of Microeconomics,
and it clearly_holds whether the commodity in demand is legal or
illegal. So long as a demand for some product exists, then there
will be profit to be made in satisfying that demand, and therefore
the demand for that product will be satisfied.  That is only a
fancy way of saying that as long as people wish to own guns, be
they criminals or average Joes, then guns will be there for them
to own.</p>

<p> I think it relevant that, for example, Brazil, manufactures
small arms.  Brazil makes actually pretty inexpensive, but
relatively decent small arms.  I think in fundamental respects
the question whether we can disarm the American criminal population
amounts to asking whether an organized criminal enterprise that
successfully imports hundreds of tons of Colombian cocaine into
the U.S. market every year would not find the means to illegally
import hundreds of tons of handguns from Brazil, if there were
some reason to do so, or some profit to be made in so doing.
And, if you agree with me that this proposition is more or less
self-evidently true, then you will conclude that we will never
reduce the supply of firearms to the criminal population by
enough to make an appreciable difference.</p>

<title>Good and Evil Guns</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Guns Are Not Good or Evil</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>My ninth observation is that per se guns are neither inherently
good nor inherently evil. Guns, that is, do not possess their own
teleology.  Benevolence and malevolence are things that inhere in
the motives and behavior of people, not in the technology they
possess.  All guns, are nothing more, nothing less, than a chunk of
machined metal that has a variety of purposes to which it can be
put, all involving a small projectile hurtling at high velocity
downrange, to lodge itself in a target.  We can only say that guns
are good when the target strikes us as an appropriate one, and evil
when not.  The gun itself is immaterial to this moral judgement.</p>

<p>Singling out certain types of guns for specific policy attention,
'assault weapons' these days, "Saturday Nite Special" handguns in an
earlier area... earlier era, is almost always justified on the
grounds that the type of gun in question "has no legitimate use"
or "is designed only to kill."  By definition, however, all guns
are designed to kill, which is to say, designed to hurtle a
projectile downrange to lodge in a target.  And if one grants the
proposition, which, I admit is an arguable proposition, that self-
defense against predation and plunder is a legitimate reason
to own a gun, then all guns, regardless of their type, regardless
of their characteristics, regardless of their firepower, regardless
of their quality, all guns, regardless, have some potentially
legitimate application.</p>

<p>It seems to me, therefore, that the focus... the frequent focus,
in gun control circles on certain "bad guns," is fundamentally
misplaced -- the idea that there are good ones and bad ones and that
we want to get rid of the bad ones.  When all is said and done, it
is the behavior of people, I think, that we evidently need to
control.</p>

<title>American Gun Culture</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Guns Are Part of American Culture</h1>

<p>From the <a href="index.html">March 31, 1995 statement</a> of Tulane
University criminologist James Wright before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p>And then, finally, my tenth observation is that guns are
important elements of our history and our culture.  Attempts to
control crime by regulating the ownership or use of firearms are
attempts to regulate the artifacts and activities of a culture that
in its own way is as unique as any of the other myriad cultures that
comprise the American ethnic mosaic.  This is what is referred to as
the American gun culture, about which many have written, and, I
believe it remains among the least understood of any of the various
subcultural strands that make up modern society.</p>

<p> The existence and characteristics of the American gun culture
also have implications that are rarely appreciated.  For one, gun
control deals with matters that people feel strongly about, that are
part of their background, and their heritage, and their upbringing
... and their worldview. Advocates for gun control are frequently
taken aback by the stridency with which their seemingly modest and
sensible proposals are attacked.  But from the gun culture's point
of view, restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms amount to
the systematic destruction of a valued way of life, and are, in that
sense, a form of cultural genocide.  Scholars, and criminologists,
and legislators, who speculate on the problem of guns and crime
and violence would, I think, profit to look at things, at least
occasionally, from the gun culture's point of view.</p>

<p>There are about 50,000,000 U.S. families who own firearms, and
hardly any of these families have ever harmed anyone with their
guns, and virtually none ever intend to.  Nearly everything these
families will ever do with their guns is both legal, and largely
innocuous.  So when we advocate restrictions on their rights to own
guns, as a means to fighting crime, we are casting aspersions on
their decency, as though we somehow hold them responsible for
the crime and violence that plague the nation.  Is it any wonder
they object often loudly and vociferously to such slander?</p>

<title>Europeans on Self-Defense</title>

<body>

<h1>Pre-20th-century Europeans on Self-Defense</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Trenchard and Moyle on Deterrence</h2>

<p>If those in government are heedless of reason, the people must patiently
submit to Bondage, or stand upon their own Defence; which if they are enabled
to do, they shall never be put upon it, but their Swords may grow rusty in
their hands; for that Nation is surest to live in Peace, that is most capable
of making War; and a Man that hath a Sword by his side, shall have least
occasion to make use of it.</p>

<p> - J. Trenchard & W. Moyle, <cite>An Argument Showing, That a Standing
Army is Inconsistent With a Free Government, and Absolutely Destructive
to the Constitution of the English Monarch</cite> (London, 1697).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Barlow on Arms</h2>

<p>The danger (where there is any) from armed citizens, is only to the
government, not to the society; as long as they have nothing to revenge
in the government (which they cannot have while it is in their own hands)
there are many advantages in their being accustomed to the use of arms
and no possible disadvantage.</p>

<p> - J. Barlow, <cite>Advice to the Privileged Orders in the Several States
of Europe: Resulting From the Necessity and Propriety of a General Revolution
in the Principle of Government</cite> (London, 1792, 1795 and reprint 1956).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Francis Place on Self-Defense</h2>

<p>Dogs could not be used in the streets in the manner many Jews were treated.
One circumstance among others put an end to the ill-usage of the Jews.
About the year 1787 Daniel Mendoza, a Jew, became a celebrated boxer and
set up a school to teach the art of boxing as a science. The art soon
spread among young Jews and they became generally expert at it. The
consequence was in a very few years seen and felt too. It was no longer
safe to insult a Jew unless he was an old man and alone. But even if the
Jews were unable to defend themselves, the few who would now be disposed to
insult them merely because they are Jews, would be in danger of chastisement
from the passers-by and of punishment from the police.</p>

<p> - Francis Place, <cite>Improvement of the Working Classes</cite> (1834) as
quoted in R. Webb, <cite>Modern England: From the 18th Century to the
Present</cite> (1970).</p>

<title>Founding Fathers on Self-Defense</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Founding Fathers on Self-Defense</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Paine on Arms</h2>

<p>Arms like laws discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe and
preserve order in the world as well as property.</p>

<p>- <a href="/revolution/by_name/P/ThomasPaine.html">Thomas Paine</a>,
<cite>Writings of Thomas Paine</cite>, M. Conway, ed., 1894.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Washington on Firearms</h2>

<p>Firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself. They are the
American people's liberty teeth and keystone under independence. From the
hour the Pilgrims landed, to the present day, events, occurrences and
tendencies prove that to ensure peace, security and happiness, the rifle
and pistol are equally indispensable. The very atmosphere of firearms
everywhere restrains evil interference - they deserve a place of honor
with all that's good.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/GeorgeWashington.html">George
Washington</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Washington on Arms and Peace</h2>

<p>To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving
peace. A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/GeorgeWashington.html">George
Washington</a>, First Annual Address, January 8, 1790.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Jefferson on Armed Rebellion</h2>

<p>God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion. The
people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong
will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts they
misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy,
the forerunner of death to the public liberty. ... And what country can
preserve its liberties, if it's rulers are not warned from time to time,
that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The
remedy is to set them right as to the facts, pardon and pacify them. What
signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is
its natural manure.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Thomas
Jefferson</a>, 13 Nov 1787</p>

<hr>

<h2>Jefferson on Use of Arms</h2>

<p>No man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. The strongest reason</p>
for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort,
to protect themselves against tyranny in government.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Thomas
Jefferson</a>, June 1776</p>

<hr>

<h2>Jefferson on Gun Sports</h2>

<p>A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I
advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives
boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no
character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be the constant companion of
your walk.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Thomas
Jefferson</a>, Foley, ed., <cite>Encyclopedia of Thomas Jefferson</cite>,
p. 318.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Jefferson on the Militia</h2>

<p>For a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well organized
and armed militia is their best security.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Thomas
Jefferson</a>, Eighth Annual Message, November 8, 1808</p>

<hr>

<h2>Madison on the Militia</h2>

<p>The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. A
well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to
arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JamesMadison.html">James Madison</a>,
in the <cite>Federalist Papers</cite> No. 46 at 243-44</p>

<p>... large and permanent military establishments which are forbidden
by the principles of free government, and against the necessity of
which the militia were meant to be a constitutional bulwark.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JamesMadison.html">James
Madison</a>, Fourth Annual Message, November 4, 1812</p>

<p>An efficient militia is authorized and contemplated by the Constitution
and required by the spirit and safety of free government.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JamesMadison.html">James
Madison</a>, Eighth Annual Message, December 3, 1816</p>

<hr>

<h2>Tench Coxe on the Second Amendment</h2>

<p>Whereas civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them,
may attempt to tyrannize, and as military forces, which must be occasionally
raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of
their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their
right to keep and bear their private arms.</p>

<p> - Tench Coxe in <cite>Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to
the Federal Constitution</cite></p>

<hr>

<h2>Tench Coxe on the Militia</h2>

<p>Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other
terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American
...  the unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the
federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain,
in the hands of the people.</p>

<p> -Tench Coxe, 20 Feb 1788</p>

<hr>

<h2>Richard Henry Lee on Arms</h2>

<p>To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people
always possess arms and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use
them.</p>

<p> - Richard Henry Lee, <cite>Letters from the Federal Farmer to the
Republic</cite>, (1787 - 1788)</p>

<hr>

<h2>Hamilton on Arms</h2>

<p>The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be
properly armed.</p>

<p> - Alexander Hamilton, <cite>The Federalist Papers</cite> at 184-188</p>

<h1>Gun Grabbers on Self-Defense</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Shogun-Era Japan</h2>

<p>The people of the various provinces are strictly forbidden to have in
their possession any swords, bows, spears, firearms or other types of arms.
The possession of these elements makes difficult the collection of taxes
and dues, and tends to permit uprising.</p>

<p>-- Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Shogun of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a>, August 29, 1558.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Shot Heard Around the World</h2>

<p>Disperse you rebels! Damn you, throw down your arms and disperse.</p>

<p>-- <a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> Major John
Pitcairn, Lexington,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ma/">Massachusetts</a>,
April 19, 1775.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Joseph Biden on Gun Control</h2>

<p>Banning guns is an idea whose time has come.</p>

<p>- U.S. Sen. Joseph Biden, then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
in an interview with AP on November 18, 1993.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Jocelyn Elders on Handguns</h2>

<p>Handguns are a public health issue.</p>

<p>- then-U.S. Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders in USA Today, Nov. 9, 1993</p>

<hr>

<h2>Feinstein on Gun Control</h2>

<p>Banning guns addresses a fundamental right of all Americans to feel safe.</p>

<p>- Sen. Dianne Feinstein quoted by AP on Nov. 18, 1993</p>

<hr>

<h2>Schumer on Gun Control</h2>

<p>We're here to tell the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>
their nightmare is true! ... We're going to hammer guns on the anvil of
relentless legislative strategy. We're going to beat guns into submission!</p>

<p>- Rep. Charles Schumer on NBC Nightly News Nov. 30, 1993.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Hillary Clinton on Guns</h2>

<p>I'm personally all for taxing guns to pay for health care coverage.</p>

<p>- Hillary Clinton quoted by the Nov. 4, 1993 <cite>New York Times</cite></p>

<hr>

<h2>Michael Gardner on Handguns</h2>

<p>There is no reason for anyone in this country -- anyone except a police
officer or a military person -- to buy, to own, to have, to use a handgun ...
The only way to control handgun use in this country is to prohibit the guns.
And the only way to do that is to change the Constitution.</p>

<p>- Michael Gardner, president of NBC News, in <cite>USA Today</cite>, January
16, 1992.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Clinton on Guns</h2>

<p>We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary
Americans to legitimately own handguns and rifles ... that we are unable to
think about reality.</p>

<p> - Bill Clinton, President of the United States, March 11, 1993</p>

<p>James Madison was the fourth President of the United States and the

<p>Still, he was a lousy writer. His messages as President were full of

<title>Thomas Jefferson</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Thomas Jefferson</h1>

<p>Thomas Jefferson is as close to a patron saint as the libertarian
movement gets. His influence may very well be the primary reason the
United States Constitution and Bill of Rights are so radically oriented
towards freedom.</p>

<p>As author of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, Jefferson made the
claim that government is there to protect liberty, not to protect us from
liberty.</p>

<p>As third President of the United States, Jefferson abolished all
internal taxation, supporting a much-reduced federal government on small
tariffs alone.</p>

<p>Jefferson's huge contributions to human liberty make Libertarians willing
to overlook his few statist tendencies. He owned slaves, but in his defense
he condemned slavery and recommended abolishing it whenever he could. He
supported public education, but then he had no experience by which to judge
it.</p>

<title>Drive-Bys in Phoenix</title>
<!-- Place: Phoenix, Arizona (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1994 or earlier -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Drive-Bys in Phoenix</h1>

<p>From the Firearms Politics list (I've lost the author and date):</p>

<p>Last time I was in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Phoenix.html">Phoenix</a>,
[<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a>,] I did some
checking on the local real-estate
market, and I came across an astonishing ad in the local market-paper. It
offered a three-bedroom house in the Phoenix area for -- are you ready for this
-- all of $10,000. No money down. $100 per month total payments. Christ on a
Harley-Davidson!</p>

<p>I called up the real-estate office making this offer, and asked about that
house. Were the walls, roof and foundation structurally sound? Yes. Were the
plumbing and electrical systems functional and up to code? Yes. Did the
air-conditioning system work?  Yes, again.  Okay, so what was wrong with the
house?  Well, it needed lots of plastering, painting, yard work, and some
patching of the roof -- and yes, low-interest repair loans were available. 
Okay, sez I. If that's all that's wrong with it, just why are you selling a
3-bedroom house for all of $10,000? Well, squirms the agent, it's in kind of a
bad neighborhood. How bad? sez I, remembering some of the neighborhoods
I've seen in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>
and Oakland.  Worst in the city, the agent sighs,
and then he told me this amazing story.</p>

<p>Every few years, it seems, the big vice-gangs in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a> notice
that there's no gang presence in Phoenix -- which is just a quick
5-hour drive from LA -- and get the idea of setting up a subsidiary
there. Well, a couple years ago, the colonizing force came to this
neighborhood -- it being poor and Spanish, they figured they could move
right in and take over -- bought this house and started operations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, the neighbors not only didn't like this -- they
didn't care for whores trotting up and down their streets all night,
pimps soliciting their kids, dope-deals on the corners in broad
daylight, and so on -- they weren't afraid to do something about it.
The neighbors called the cops (for some reason, the Phoenix police are
remarkably honest, capable, polite and prompt), and the cops promptly
came and swept up all the whores, pimps and pushers off the street and
away to jail.</p>

<p>The remaining gang members decided to retaliate in the
fashion they usually use in LA; they got the complainant's name and
address off the court records, and did a drive-by shooting at his
house.  Well, this wasn't Los Angeles. The moment the neighbors heard
the first gunshots fired, they all ran out their front doors with their
own guns -- rifles, shotguns, pistols, everything -- and shot back.</p>

<p>The car didn't make it to the end of the block. It coasted to a
stop, riddled with more holes than the famous Bonnie and Clyde getaway
car (which I've seen; it's on display in a casino in a casino in Las
Vegas).  The gas tank and fuel lines had been ruptured, so the car
caught fire. The neighbors waited a good 15 minutes -- making sure
nobody got out of that car -- before they called the fire department to
come put out the fire and tow the wreck away. By that time, the asphalt
under the car had melted and caught fire too, which subsequently left a
large and nasty pot-hole in the street. The city is slow about
repairing small streets, so the hole stayed there providing a traffic
hazard for several months. All this was two years ago, the agent
concluded, and there's been no trouble since, but the house and the
neighborhood still have a bad reputation -- and that's why the house
was so cheap.</p>

<p>Hearing this story, I nearly laughed my ass off. I told the agent
that if I had the money at the moment, I'd by-god buy the house; this
was nothing compared to bad neighborhoods I'd seen here in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>, where
drive-by shootings go unchecked by the well-armed
cops, let alone by the unarmed neighbors. If that's the absolute worst
you'll find in Phoenix, then that's the city for me.</p>

<p>That's the difference that an armed civilian population makes. Think about
it.</p>

<h1>Cryptography</h1>

<p>Cryptography is the art of making and breaking codes. Crypto is
at the center of electronic privacy, being able to communicate privately
with whom you choose -- and keeping everyone else, including
government agents, from listening in.</p>

<p>The United States considers encryption technology a munition,
putting it under the same export controls used for nuclear weapons.
Ironically, the computer source code for an encryption algorithm can
be exported outside the United States without controls, but an
electronic copy of the same code is restricted.</p>

<p>Topics in crypto:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="pgp/">Pretty Good Privacy</a>: protection for the masses
<li><a href="escrow/">Key escrow</a>: encryption with built-in
	wiretap, including the notorious Clipper Chip</a>

<title>Bombing Pattern Suggest Multiple Bombs</title>
<!-- Place: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (USA) -->
<!-- Time: bombing April 19, 1995;
	Key's memo June 27, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Pattern of Oklahoma City Bombing</h1>

<p>Many people believe the FBI and BATF are lying about the number, type and
location of the <a href="index.html">bombs</a> that destroyed the Alfred
Murrah Federal Building in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a>.</p>

<p>The pattern of the bombing is among the evidence against the
government's "single fertilizer bomb" theory. The damage was not centered
around the truck bomb's location, and some munitions experts claim that
no fertilizer bomb could have destroyed the building's support columns.</p>

<p>However, others have pointed out that geometric arrangement of ANFO
barrels as well as other tamping methods could focus the energy of the
explosion.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Multiple Bomb Theory</h2>

<p>Nick Hull (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:Glockist@AOL.com">Glockist@AOL.com</a>) posted this excerpt from
Tim Hudson's "Friends Faxing Friends" to <img src="/images/news.gif"
alt="[USENET]"><a href="news:talk.politics.guns">talk.politics.guns</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were actually two explosions, the "truck bomb" blew first (for cover)
outside the building and then a string of charges wired together that were
physically placed on some of the building columns at ground level detonated
seconds later. The second blast was set to cause maximum structural changes.</p>

<p>... The truckbomb could never have caused the patter of damage that was
evident from the newspaper photos.  A truck bomb charge immense enough to
break, from a distance, those reinforced concrete columns, would certainly
blow out the exterior curtain wall at ground level on the opposite and
undamaged side of the building.  There is no such damage on the opposite
side exterior wall, which is intact.</p>

<p>The pattern of blown columns is not close to being circular as would be
expected if the blast emanated from one origin.  As we know, the power of
a detonation diminishes, proportionately as the distance (in all
directions, i.e. circular) is increased.  However, this pattern of
destruction is essentially linear, except for one indentation that should
have been, but is not directly opposite of the ground crater. ... Most
incredibly, there are intact window frames closer to the center of the
ground crater than are the missing concrete columns.</p>

<p>... The debris is blown out of the building as one would expect from an
interior blast.  An exterior blast would blow debris into the still
standing interior of the building.  In summary, this linear pattern is
totally indicative of high brissance charges placed directly on columns.
The 1200 lbs. of ammonium nitrate (a slow burn explosive) reported in the
press could not have caused this kind of damage to support columns from
that distance, no way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Oklahoma City Legislator Calls for Investigation</h1>

<p>Craig D.W. Hammond (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:spna@ionet.net">spna@ionet.net</a>) of Lawton, Oklahoma
reported to Libernet about local news coverage.</p>

<p>Hammond summarized an article in June 28, 1995 <cite>The Daily
Oklahoman</cite> about an <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/">Oklahoma</a> state
legislator who disbelieves the
government's version of the bombing.</p>

<p>Oklahoma State Rep. Charles Key (R-Oklahoma City) lost a close friend in
the bombing. In a June 27 memorandum sent to his fellow legislators, Key
called for an independent investigation, saying he does not believe a
fertilizer bomb destroyed the federal building.</p>

<p>"I am convinced that the government is not being forthright about
the kind of bomb(s), the number of explosions, the placement of the
explosives and other crucial aspects of the April 19 bombing," Key said.
"I'm convinced that for that building to come down like that, it had to have
explosives at the columns to bring it down or at strategic places.  The FBI is
saying a truck bomb drove up and sat out front and blew up."</p>

<p>Key's memo included a copy of a letter from retired Air Force Brigadier
General Benton K. Partin to U.S. Senator Don Nickles (R-Oklahoma). Partin's
letter claims "the damage pattern on the reinforced concrete superstructure
could not possibly have been attained from the single truck bomb without
supplementing demolition charges at some of the reinforced column bases."</p>

<p>Hammond also summarized a June 28, 1995 television interview of Sam Cohen,
inventor of the neutron bomb, by KFOR-TV (the Oklahoma City NBC affiliate).
"I don't care how much fertilizer and fuel oil they used, it would never be
enough," Cohen said. "Demolition charges placed at key column did the dirty
work."</p>

<title>Clipper Chip</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>The "Clipper Chip" is a general name for a proposal originating in the
Bush administration and pushed by the Clinton administration to establish
a federal encryption standard that includes a "back door" for law
enforcement.</p>

<p>Clipper is actually comprised of several parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Skipjack encryption algorithm, which is classified, forms the
basis for the Clipper components.
<li>The Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) is intended to replace the current
Digital Encryption Standard (DES). EES involves components using the Skipjack
algorithm, with skeleton keys held by federal agencies. Law enforcement
officials (with a warrant of course, trust us) could obtain the escrowed
keys to decrypt any EES-encrypted data.
<li>The Clipper chip itself implements EES for telephones.
<li>The Capstone chip implements EES for computers.
<li>The Tessera card is a PC card containing Capstone.
</ul>

<p>When the Clinton White House announced plans to implement EES, the online
community reacted strongly. As a result, plans for Capstone and Tessera were
put on hold. Although the administration initially said they never intended
to ban other means of encryption, FBI director <a
href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis Freeh</a> later said he would
seek such a ban if criminals didn't use EES (duh).</p>

<p>EES met strong online opposition, and several Congressman promised to
block appropriations for EES. After the 1995
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a>
<a href="/revolution/multi/war/okc/">Federal Building bombing</a>,
reptilian opportunists like Clinton seized the chance to rush through a
Counter-Terrorism Bill, which included funding for Clipper.</p>

<p>To try to rescue the sinking Clipper Chip, U.S. federal agencies
proposed a variation called Commercial Key Escrow, in which private
companies would hold the skeleton keys and provide them to police
when presented with a warrant.</p>

<title>Testimony of James Wright</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: testimony March 31, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Ten Fundamental Gun Facts</h1>

<p>March 31, 1995 statement of Tulane University criminologist James Wright
before the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Crime of
the Committee on the Judiciary:</p>

<p><i>Dr. WRIGHT:</i> Thank you so much, and thank you for the opportunity to be
here.  My name is James Wright... and I'm a professor of sociology at Tulane
University.  I've spent the last twenty years of my academic career conducting
research on guns and violence in American society.  In the course of these two
decades, I have come to the conclusion that there are at least ten simple, but
terribly important facts about guns in America that every participant in the
gun control debate should be aware of.  I have referred to these in a recent
paper as "Ten Essential Observations on Guns in America," and my point is to
share them with the Committee today.</p>

<p> While many of the facts of the gun control issue are hotly contested, and
matters of great dispute, the ten fundamental truths that I wish to discuss are
matters about which everyone more or less agrees.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="households.html">Half of U.S. households own guns</a>
<li><a href="circulation.html">200,000,000 firearms are in the U.S. now</a>
<li><a href="sport.html">Most guns are owned for recreation</a>
<li><a href="defense.html">Many guns are owned for defense against crime</a>
<li><a href="retail.html">Bad guys don't buy guns through retail channels</a>
<li><a href="violence.html">Bad guys carry guns for surviving violent world</a>
<li><a href="law.html">Bad guys indifferent to existing gun control laws</a>
<li><a href="demand.html">Demand for guns creates its own supply</a>
<li><a href="evil.html">Guns are not inherently good or evil</a>
<li><a href="culture.html">Guns are part of the American culture</a>
</ol>
 
<p>And, thank you so much for your attention.  Dr. Bordua...</p>

<title>Racist Origins of U.S. Gun Control</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1800's and 1900's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Racist Origins of U.S. Gun Control</h1>

<p>From a review by Jim Powell of Clayton Cramer's <cite>For the Defense of
Themselves and the State: The Original Intent and Judicial Interpretation
of the Right to Keep and Bear Arms</cite>:</p>

<p>... [Cramer] discovered how judges weasled out of upholding the Second
Amendment.  He provides many examples where judges simply ignored it as well as
their own state constitution which protected gun rights, without offering a
reason why.  An <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a> Supreme Court
judge dismissed the Second Amendment as
"that right, whatever it may be," refusing to elaborate.  Other examples show
how judges supported their decisions with factual errors about the origin of
the Second Amendment. Then there are examples of judges who cited misleading
precedents -- legal reasoning supposedly contained wasn't there, or one point
cited was contradicted by other points in a decision.</p>

<p>In documenting the racist history of gun control laws, Cramer makes clear that
a major purpose is to keep people down.  For example, he tells how, during the
1830s, 
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/md/">Maryland</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/va/">Virginia</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a> enacted
laws disarming free
blacks.  Cramer notes how the Supreme Court, in the notorious Dred Scott case
(1857), denounced the idea that free blacks should be able to keep and bear
arms.</p>

<p>Cramer talks at length about the gun control laws which Southern states enacted
after the Civil War to keep blacks down.  For example, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/">Louisiana</a>: "No negro who
is not in the military service shall be allowed to carry fire-arms, or any kind
of weapons, within the parish, without the special written permission of his
employers, approved and endorsed by the nearest and most convenient chief of
patrol."  And
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ms/">Mississippi</a>:
"No freedman, free Negro, or mulatto not in the
military service of the United States government, and not licensed so to do by
the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry firearms of any
kind..."</p>

<p>States used various tactics to restrict gun rights.  Judges limited the kinds
of weapons individuals could own, ruled it was illegal to carry concealed
weapons -- or illegal to carry weapons openly.</p>

<p>Judges used a variety of weasel words to uphold these laws.  A
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/">Tennessee</a>
judge
declared such laws were legit because their aim was to "promote the public
peace."  He claimed that when a lot of people carried pistols, the result was
"dangerous wounds, as well as frequent homicides."</p>

<p>In 1872, a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> judge was
surprisingly frank in admitting that gun control
promoters don't give a hoot for liberty: "It is useless to talk about personal
liberty being infringed by laws such as that under consideration. The world has
seen too much licentiousness cloaked under the name of natural or personal
liberty..."  The judge trashed the state's constitution which spoke clearly:
"Every person shall have the right to keep and bear arms."</p>

<title>Nazi Origin of U.S. Gun Control</title>
<!-- Place: Germany and USA -->
<!-- Time: Nazi Weapons Law 1938, U.S. Gun Control Act 1968 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Origin of U.S. Gun Control Laws</h1>

<p>Excerpts from an article in the May 1993 <cite>Guns and Ammo</cite>
by <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/JPFO.html">Jews for the Preservation of
Firearms Ownership</a>. Posted to the Internet with
permission by Craig Peterson.</p>

<p>Members of Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO)
consider gun control to be an aggressive cancer.  JPFO has a cure, a
way to destroy gun control.  JPFO has hard evidence that shows that
the Nazi Weapons Law (March 18, 1938) is the source of the U.S. Gun
Control Act of 1968 (GCA'68).  Adolph Hitler signed the Nazi Weapons
Law.  The Gestapo (Nazi National Secret Police) enforced it.  In <cite>Gun
Control: Gateway to Tyranny</cite> we present the official German text of
the Nazi Weapons Law and a side-by-side translation into English.
Even more deadly: a side-by-side, section-by-section comparison of
the GCA'68 with the Nazi Weapons Law.  If you have this in your hands,
no one can tell you that you're imagining things.</p>

<p>GCA'68 marked a new approach to gun control. It replaced
the Federal Firearms Act (June 30, 1938), which was based on the
federal power to regulate interstate commerce.  The 1938 law required
firearms dealers to get a federal license (which then cost $1).  Only
dealers could ship firearms across state lines.  Ordinary people could
receive shipments from dealers.</p>

<p>In GCA'68 the government required that in almost all cases only
dealers could send and receive firearms across state lines.  This
ended "mail order" sales of firearms by law-abiding persons who are
not licensed dealers.</p>

<p>GCA'68 hits you even harder.  Congress gave federal bureaucrats
in <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington, D.C.</a>,
the power to decide what kinds of firearms you can own.</p>

<p>The framers of GCA'68 borrowed an idea--that certain firearms are
"hunting weapons"--from the Nazi Weapons Law (Section 21 and Section
32 of the Regulations, page 61 and page 73, respectively, of Gun
Control.- Gateway to Tyranny).  The equivalent U.S. term, "sporting
purpose," was used to classify firearms.  But it was not defined
anywhere in GCA'68.  Thus, bureaucrats were empowered to ban whole
classes of firearms.  They have, in fact, done so.</p>

<p>The Nazi Weapons Law of 1938 replaced a Law on Firearms and
Ammunition of April 13, 1928.  The 1928 law was enacted by a
center-right, freely elected German government that wanted to curb
"gang activity," violent street fights between Nazi party and
Communist party thugs.  All firearms owners and their firearms had to
be registered.  Sound familiar?  Gun control did not save democracy in
Germany.  It helped to make sure that the toughest criminals, the
Nazis, prevailed.</p>

<p>The Nazis inherited lists of firearm owners and their firearms
when they lawfully took power in March 1933.  The Nazis used these
inherited registration lists to seize privately held firearms from
persons who were not "reliable." Knowing exactly who owned which
firearms, the Nazis had only to revoke the annual ownership permits or
decline to renew them.</p>

<p>In 1938, five years after taking power, the Nazis enhanced the
1928 law.  The Nazi Weapons Law introduced handgun control.  Firearms
ownership was restricted to Nazi party members and other "reliable"
people.</p>

<p>The 1938 Nazi law barred Jews from businesses involving firearms.
On November 10, 1938--one day after the Nazi party terror squads (the
SS) savaged thousands of Jews, synagogues and Jewish businesses
through-out Germany--new regulations under the Weapons Law
specifically barred Jews from owning any weapons, even clubs or knives.</p>

<p>Exhibit No. 62 (see reproduction) [added to the end of this
document] is fascinating.  This letter--dated July 12, 1968--is to
Subcommittee Chairman Dodd from Lewis C. Coffin, Law Librarian at the
Library of Congress.  Coffin wrote:</p>

<p>"...We are enclosing herewith a translation of the Law on Weapons
of March 18, 1938, prepared by Dr. William Solyom-Fekete of [the
European Law Division -ed.] as well as the Xerox of the original
German text which you supplied" (Subcommittee Hearings, p. 489).</p>

<p>This letter makes it public knowledge that at the end of June
1968 -- 4 months before GCA'68 was enacted -- Senator Thomas J. Dodd, now
deceased, personally owned a copy of the original German text of the
Nazi Weapons Law.</p>

<p>We are not the first to have seen this hearing record.  But we
appear to be the first to have recognized its importance.  This
hearing record suggests strongly that the late Senator Thomas J. Dodd
(D-CT) himself implanted the Nazi Weapons Law into American law, or,

<title>U.S. Assault Weapons Ban</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: May 5, 1994 -->

<body>
<h1>U.S. House Passes Assault Weapons Ban</h1>

<p>May 1994, from Release 1.11 of the Online Report to the Firearms Coalition,
Box 6537, Silver Spring, MD 20916 (Copyright 1994 by Neal Knox Associates,
P.O. Box 6537, Rockville, MD  20916. Reproduction and distribution of this
bulletin by any means is encouraged so long as this statement is retained.):</p>

<p>House-Passed Gun/Magazine Ban</p>

<p>Following is the Judiciary Committee version of <a href="hr4296.html">H.R.
4296</a> which passed the House 216-214 May 5, 1994.</p>

<p>It has numerous subtle but significant changes from the
Feinstein amendment included in the Senate-passed crime bill. 
Either of the versions, or a combination of the two, will be folded
into the House-Senate conference committee compromise.</p>

<p>The conference committee will probably reach an agreement
within two weeks, then each house will have to approve their
compromise.</p>

<p>Both bills prohibit possession of over-10-shot magazines and
"feeding devices," or the parts from which one can be made, which
were manufactured after the effective date (with exceptions for
police and military, or retired law enforcement officers given a
magazine -- or gun -- by his agency).  New over-10 magazines would
have to be serial numbered and clearly marked as made after the
effective date.  "High capacity feeding devices" would be
classified as firearms.</p>

<p>There is no criteria as to how a person would prove that a 15-
shot Beretta or Ruger pistol magazine, or a 20-round AR-15
magazine, were legally possessed prior to the effective date.</p>

<p>The Senate-passed version requires owners of affected guns to
record ownership by registering that gun with a dealer within 90
days.  Such registered guns could subsequently be transferred by
obtaining a Form 4473 from the buyer, then permanently keeping it. 
The 4473 used for registration would have to be kept with the gun.</p>

<p>Failure to comply with the Senate-required provisions would be
punishable by 6 months in jail, $1,000 fine and permanent
prohibition from possessing any firearm.  An unregistered gun would
be contraband.</p>

<p>The House-passed version does not include the requirement that
presently possessed guns be registered.  It does require that the
seller of a grandfathered gun obtain a Form 4473 from the buyer. 
In the subcommittee Chairman Charles Schumer changed that to allow
BATF to designate any form, raising concerns that they might
require the same form used for the transfer of a machine gun.  </p>

<p>In the full committee Schumer offered an amendment striking
the prohibition on ownership for someone who failed to keep proper
paperwork, and stated he would insist on that change being put into
the final conference committee bill.</p>

<p>Also in full committee he assured Rep. Glickman that
"unmodified sporting handguns" like the Glock, Ruger P-89 and
Beretta 92F wouldn't be affected by the bill.  After the meeting I
told Glickman that Schumer hadn't told him the truth, since those
guns could not be manufactured and sold for the over-10-shot
magazines for which they were designed.</p>

<p>On the floor, to win the vote of someone, Schumer made a vague
promise to remove all the record-keeping requirements on
grandfathered guns.  Chairman Jack Brooks told the House that such
a commitment couldn't be kept because similar requirements were in
both bills.</p>

<p>The 19 named models include the Intratec TEC-22, TEC-9, TEC-
DC9; AK-47S from several makers; Uzi and Galil; Beretta AR-70; SWD
M10, M11, M11/9 and M12; Colt AR-15; FN/FAL, FN/FLR, FNC; and Steyr
AUG.  Also banned are lookalikes "of any caliber."</p>

<p>According to ABC, President Clinton got
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nc/">North Carolina</a>
Congressman Steve Neal to sign on by promising that only those 19
guns would be banned.  If so, he lied, for BATF has written Sen.
Larry Craig that the generic definitions apply to 45 "currently
advertised" models, and Gun Week has listed 184 guns that would be
affected.</p>

<p>Affected guns are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Semi-auto pistols which have a detachable magazine and two
or more features such as a barrel shroud, threaded muzzle, or
magazine other than in the grip, or which weigh over 50 ounces
unloaded;</p>

<li><p>Semi-auto rifles with a detachable magazine and two or more
features such as a folding or telescoping stock, protruding pistol
grip, bayonet mount, flash suppressor, grenade launcher attachment,
or threaded barrel muzzle;</p>

<li><p>Semi-auto shotguns with a fixed magazine over five rounds,
an ability to accept a detachable magazine or drum, with a pistol
grip extending below the action, or with a folding or telescoping
stock.</p>
</ul>

<h2><a name=s0>Comments and Sponsors</a></h2>

<p>Adopted 216-214, May 5, 1994.</p>

<p>The gavel did not fall to close the vote until about five
minutes after the usual end of voting.  During that delay, a
contingent of Democrats convinced Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.) to change
his vote from opposition to support for the bill, swinging the
count from 213 for, 214 against, to 214-213.  </p>

<p>The last two votes were cast for the bill by Sanford Bishop
(D-Ga.) and Douglas Applegate (D-Oh.), both of whom had been
expected to vote against the bill.</p>

<h2>NRA Takes Clinton Gun Ban To Court</h2>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington, D.C.</a>
 -- On Tuesday, February 7th, the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National Rifle Association</a>
of America will file suit in U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan in Bay City, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a>. Target of
the suit: the 1994 Clinton gun ban.</p>

<p>Joined by her attorneys, Mrs. Tanya K. Metaksa, NRA's chief
lobbyist, will discuss the suit at a press conference in Lansing at
3 p.m.  Also accompanying Mrs. Metaska will be Tom Washington, NRA
President and executive director of Michigan United Conservation
Clubs (M.U.C.C.), a co-plaintiff in the suit.</p>

<p>"We challenged the Clinton gun ban in the voting booth November
8th, and we won," said Mrs. Metaksa. "We are challenging the ban in
the 104th Congress, and we are gaining ground. It is time to take
our case to the courts."</p>

<p> Press Conference Details:</p>

<p> Where:  Lansing Center, Room 104, 333 East Michigan Avenue,
Lansing, Michigan 48933.</p>

<p> Date/Time:      Tuesday, February 7 at 3:00 p.m.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Fact Sheet</h2>

<p> In Public Law 103-322, Congress outlawed "Semiautomatic Assault
Weapons."  What are they?  That is the question raised by this suit.</p>

<p> The Clinton gun ban defines them in two ways:</p>

<p> The first definition is any of the firearms :"known as" the
"avtomat Kalashnikov," the "Colt AR-15," etc. -- together with
"copies or duplicates" of any of these.</p>

<p> The second definition includes any rifle with two or more features
from a list of five -- pistol grip, folding stock, etc.</p>

<p> In court, NRA will prove that the statute is constitutionally void
in many respects. The most obvious are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Void for Vagueness: "KNOWN AS"</p>

<p> The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that a law is "void for
vagueness" when a person of ordinary intelligence cannot determine
what is allowed or forbidden. The first definition of the forbidden
firearms are guns "known as" certain names. Yet, six of the seven
names given are, in fact, the names of fully automatic firearms
(i.e., machine guns). For example, Colt has not made a
semiautomatic rifle named "AR-15" since the mid-1980s.</p>

<p> Thus, the statute has to, literally, aimed at guns "known as" the
AR-15, etc. -- not guns which are so named.</p>

<li><p>Void for Vagueness: "COPIES OR DUPLICATES"</p>

<p> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (which encompasses
Michigan) recently struck down a city ban on certain semiautomatic
firearms as void for vagueness.  <cite>Springfield Armory v. City of
Columbus</cite>, 29 F. 2D 250 (6th Cir. 1994).  That city banned named
guns and "models by the same manufacturer with the same action
design that have slight modifications or enhancements." The Sixth
Circuit pointed out that guns varied widely in design, function and
power; it was impossible to determine how much of a difference it
took to make something not of "the same action design.'  The
Clinton gun ban is even more ambiguous.</p>

<li><p>Equal Protection of the Law</p>

<p> The Clinton gun ban also violates the equality components of the
"due process" clause of the Fifth Amendment. Congress banned the
"Colt AR-15" without banning nine other companies' manufacture of
nearly identical rifles. It added a list of over a hundred guns --
by manufacturers' names -- which were exempt from the ban -- even
though many have identical function (caliber, rate of fire, etc.)
to banned items. The Ruger Mini-14 fires the same cartridges as the
AR-15, but is exempted.</p>

<p> Due process implies some equality of treatment and that
inequalities have some "rational basis." There is none in the
Clinton gun ban.</p>

<title>Repeal of U.S. Assault Weapons Ban</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: April 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Repeal of Assault Weapons Ban</h1>

<p>After the Republicans regained control of the U.S. House and Senate in
November 1994, they made repeal of the Clinton Weapons Ban a top priority.</p>

<p>Republican-controlled committees held weeks of hearings at which people
testified to the value of guns including assault weapons in self-protection.</p>

<p>In April 1995, several U.S. House Republicans and Democrats introduced H.R.
1488, calling for repeal of the ban, guarantee of individuals owning any
firearm in their home for self-defense, increasing penalties for "criminal
misuse" of firearms, and directing U.S. attorneys to increase prosecution of
criminals using firearms.</p>

<p>The repeal of the ban is obviously a step in the right direction. The others
bring up more questions than answers. What types of firearms are guaranteed to
be legal? What determines use for self-defense? Does "criminal misuse" of
firearms include violations of minor BATF regulations which shouldn't exist in
the first place?</p>

<title>UN Working Paper on Global Gun Control</title>
<!-- Place: Global -->
<!-- Time: working paper approved May 9, 1994; meetings Spring 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>U.N. Proposes International Gun Control</h1>

<p>On May 9, 1994, the United Nations Disarmament Commission adopted a
working paper calling for international controls on the gun trade, according
to the Associated Press. The working paper was adopted by consensus vote;
the commission has representatives from each U.N. member country, including
the U.S.</p>

<p>The working paper has no authority, but could serve as a basis for debate in
the U.N. General Assembly. The anti-gun campaign is led by Colombia, although
other countries such as
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/India/">India</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russia</a> joined in eagerly.</p>

<p>The smugglers who bring drugs into the U.S. often bring back guns into
Colombia. You'd think that the Colombians would get a clue from drug
prohibition that gun prohibition won't work. In fact, guns are completely
banned in Colombia, which is awash in firearms.</p>

<p>Colombian officials feel that the proper response to the failure of gun
prohibition in their country is more gun prohibition elsewhere.</p>

<p>The working paper adopted by the Disarmament Commission places the
subject on the commission's agenda for spring 1995. A final report may be
issued in 1996.</p>

<p>The working paper calls for "harmonization" of gun controls, saying,
"the arms permitted for civilian use ... should be subject to controls at all
points in the chain, from production and-or acquisition up to the time they
are sold to an individual. From then on they should remain subject to
monitoring and control."</p>

<title>Firearms Laws in Bowerbank</title>
<!-- Place: Bowerbank, Maine (USA) -->
<!-- Time: reported June 22, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Bowerbank, Maine Requires Gun Ownership</h1>

<p>As reported in the June 22, 1994 <cite>Central Maine Morning
Sentinel</cite>, the town of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/me/Bowerbank.html">Bowerbank</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/me/">Maine</a> passed an
ordinance requiring heads of households to own arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>The <cite>Sentinel</cite> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Actually, its written to make a statement," said the leading proponent of the
ordinance, William Quigley, a taxidermist and retired police chief in Nashua,
N.H. "It's just an attention getter".</p>

<p>... Residents signed petitions to force the vote at Saturday's town meeting.
The vote was 26-11. Bowerbank has 72 registered voters, said Town Clerk Joyce
Doolittle.</p>

<p>... The ordinance does not apply to seasonal residents, many who occupy
cottages along the shores of Sebec Lake at the Central Maine town's edge.
The ordinance has no enforcement provision, and specifically allows exceptions
or those who are opposed to weapons on principle, said Quigley. It also excuses
hose with physical or mental disabilites, felons and "paupers", said Quigley.
Another provision frees the town of any responsibility for shooting accidents
and from having to buy guns or ammo for residents.</p>

<title>Firearms Laws in Kennesaw</title>
<!-- Place: Kennesaw, Georgia (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1982 (reported November 1994) -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Kennesaw Requires Gun Ownership</h1>

<p>Reprinted without permission from <cite>The Georgia Libertarian</cite>,
a monthly publication of the Libertarian Party of Georgia (1874 Piedmont
Road Suite 590-E,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/Atlanta.html">Atlanta</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">GA</a> 30324,
404/888-9468, 1-800-257-2493, Fax:404/874-8339):</p>

<p>In mid-November, the [Atlanta, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia's</a>] Fulton County
government began
requiring all gun dealers to stick a government-issued warning label on
their firearms.  The labels attribute all sorts of dire dangers and
consequences to the purchase and ownership of guns.</p>

<p>If gun-owning is so dangerous and such a cause of social ills, then surely
the most dangerous place in America - if not the entire planet - must be
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/Kennesaw.html">Kennesaw</a>,
Georgia [a suburb of Atlanta], where since 1982 a law has
required every household to have a firearm and ammunition. (Conscientious
objectors are excluded.)</p>

<p>Right?  <em>Wrong.</em></p>

<p>There has not been a single reported crime of domestic violence in
Kennesaw since the law was passed.  There have been no injuries to
children involving guns since the law was passed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, violence has actually <em>dropped</em> since 1982.  Burglaries
per thousand inhabitants fell from 11 to less than 3.  There hasn't been a
single murder since 1986.  All this despite the fact that the population
in Kennesaw <em>doubled</em> in that time.</p>

<p>Could it be - gasp! - that gun ownership might have positive, not
negative effects?  That the whole premise behind gun banning is totally
wrong?  That other factors besides guns might be the real cause of Fulton
County's crime problems?</p>

<p>Nah, just ask the Fulton County Commission.</p>

<h1>CCW in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/">Louisiana</a></h1>

<p>May 18, 1995, from the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>:</p>

<p>Good news from Baton Rouge!  The State House approved H.B.  2442,
NRA-supported right-to-carry legislation, on an overwhelming 75-28 vote!
The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration. Another right to carry
bill, S.B. 1256, has already passed the Senate and awaits consideration by
the House Administration of Criminal Justice Committee. We'll keep you posted
as these bills progress.</p>

<p>Also, a Senate committee killed S.B. 1256, a bill opposed by NRA that would
have established mandatory storage procedures for firearms stored at home.</p>

<p>House Bill 2080, legislation that would exempt <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/NewOrleans.html">New Orleans</a>
from the statewide firearms pre-emption statute, will be heard in
the House Committee on Administration of Criminal Justice on
Tuesday, May 23 at 9:00 a.m.  This bill would allow New Orleans to
enact restrictive "gun control" ordinances in conflict with state
law, creating confusion and hardship for law-abiding gun owners.</p>

<hr>

<p>June 2, 1995, from another NRA alert:</p>

<p>The House Administration on Criminal Justice Committee
approved SB 886, NRA-backed right to carry reform legislation.
This bill now moves to the House floor for consideration.</p>

<h1>Concealed-Carry Weapons (CCW) Permits</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania's</a>
Constitution states, "The right of the citizens to bear arms
in defence of themselves and the State shall not be questioned," (Article 1,
Paragraph 21). Permits to carry concealed firearms are available to someone who
goes down to the County courthouse with $12.50 and two passport sized photos of
himself, fills out a form, gets fingerprinted, and supplies two character
references. (In January 1997, someone emailed me to say that fingerprints
are not required.)</p>

<body>

<h1>George Washington</h1>

<p>George Washington, American Revolutionary, Founding Father, was the first
President of the United States.</p>

<p>Libertarians respect Washington for the role he played in American
independence, but Washington seemed more concerned with
social order than with liberty. Thinkers like <a
href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Thomas Jefferson</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/P/ThomasPaine.html">Thomas Paine</a> are closer
to current libertarian thought. (Of course this is in
relative terms; Washington would be infinitely preferable to any of the
scumbags the Presidency has seen lately.)</p>

<title>DEA Attacks Again</title>

<body>

<h1>Feds Terrorize Women</h1>

<p>From the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>:</p>

<p>Just after dawn on September 5, 1991 some sixty agents from the DEA, U.S.
Forest Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF), and National
Guard, complete with painted faces and camouflage and accompanied by another
twenty or more National Guard troops with a light armored vehicle, raided the
homes of Sina Brush and two of her neighbors near
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/Montainair.html">Montainair</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/">New Mexico</a>. Brush
and her daughter were still asleep.</p>

<p>Hearing noises outside, Ms. Brush got up and was only halfway across the
room, when the door was kicked in by the agents. Clad only in their underwear,
Ms. Brush and her daughter were handcuffed and forced to kneel in the middle of
the room while the agents searched the house. No drugs were found. The police
had obtained a warrant using information furnished by an unreliable informant
and had entered Brush's home without knocking first.</p>

<title>DEA Attacks Again</title>
<!-- Place: Poway, California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: August 25, 1992 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>DEA critically wounds innocent man</h1>

<p>From the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On August 25, 1992 at about 10:30 p.m., Donald Carlson returned to his home
in <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Poway.html">Poway</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>,
opened his garage door with a remote control device,
simultaneously illuminating the garage so that Drug Enforcement Administration
agents conducting surveillance from nearby could see inside. Just after
midnight, when Carlson was asleep, a group of DEA agents burst into his house.
Thinking they were robbers, Carlson grabbed his pistol to defend himself. He
also dialed 911 for help. The agents shot Carlson three times, twice after he
was down and clearly disabled. Carlson spent seven weeks in intensive care,
fighting for his life. No drugs were found on the premises.</p>

<p>It was later learned that the Federal Customs Service, the DEA and the U.S.
Attorney's Office in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanDiego.html">San Diego</a>
had relied on an informant who was known to be
untrustworthy and who claimed Carlson's garage contained 2,500 kilograms of
cocaine (a large amount which would have taken up most of the garage) and four
armed guards. The agents conducted the raid in spite of the fact they could see
the informant's information was erroneous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Libernet, Rich McCormack (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:macknet@cts.com">macknet@cts.com</a>) quoted the
May 29, 1995 San Diego <cite>Union-Tribune</cite> giving details of the
shooting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the raid was launched, the WET [Weapons Entry Tactical unit,
similar to SWAT] team couldn't break through the heavy oak double front
doors. After pounding the doors three or four times with a battering
ram, they smashed a front window and tried to climb through but got
tangled in a Venetian blind.</p>

<p>By the time they got in, Carlson had awakened from a deep sleep and armed
himself, groggily thinking he was being beseiged by a band of robbers. The
first agent inside saw a dark figure with a gun and started shooting. Wounded
in the leg, Carlson threw down his weapon and retreated to his bedroom, where
he curled himself into a fetal position on the floor.</p>

<p>Another agent burst through the door and fired two more shots.
One entered Carlson's back, sending a bullet fragment into his lung.</p>

<p>Hooked to a ventilator in a hospital's intensive-care wing, Carlson
hovered near death for six weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Carlson has settled in a civil judgment with the U.S. Attorney's office for
$2.75 million. Although the informant was found guilty of lying to the
government, and faces more than ten years in prison, none of the government
agents have been punished for their actions.</p>

<title>Rayna Ross</title>
<!-- Place: Fairfax, Virginia (USA) -->

<h1>The Rayna Ross Stalking Case</h1>

<p>February 1994, downloaded from GUN-TALK (703-719-6406), a service of the 
<a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National Rifle Association</a>
Institute for Legislative Action, Washington, DC 20036:</p>

<p>NRA DEFENDS WOMAN MARINE AGAINST OUTRAGEOUS GOVERNMENT ASSAULT ON HER
RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE by Tom Wyld.</p>

<p>
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/va/Fairfax.html">Fairfax</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/va/">Virginia</a> -- Within
days of purchasing a handgun for
self-protection, Marine Lance Corporal Rayna Ross had to use it to
defend herself. Now, within days of a federal waiting period taking
effect that could cost the lives of other crime victims like Ross,
the U.S. Marine Corps will hold a hearing to determine if her lawful
act was a criminal act.</p>

<p> "The government has hounded this woman long enough," said Michael
Patrick Murray, retired Marine Corps Colonel, counsel with the
National Rifle Association of America, and individual counsel for the
Marine Lance Corporal.  "In her suburban Virginia home, Rayna Ross 
faced deadly attack June 29, 1993, from a stalker who had attacked 
her repeatedly.  The commonwealth attorney investigated and found 
a clear-cut case of justifiable homicide.  Months after the unfortunate
incident, while Ross was on leave in  her Arkadelphia,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ar/">Arkansas</a>,
hometown awaiting discharge last year, the Marine Corps recalled 
her to Quantico.  For weeks, she was either stalked, attacked, or 
in hiding.  Now she faces a murder charge -- a preposterous insult 
to a victim of violent crime  --  to a mother repeatedly victimized."</p>

<p> Ross faces an Article 32 hearing (analogous to a Grand Jury) in
Quantico, Virginia, Thursday, February 17. She is presently charged
with First Degree Murder.  Such hearings are customarily open to the public.</p>

<p> "The right of self-defense is under attack," said Mrs. Tanya Metaksa
of Springfield, Virginia, newly appointed chief lobbyist of NRA's
Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA).  "The federal waiting 
period was sold as worthwhile if it saved just one innocent life. 
In Lance Corporal Ross's case, it would have cost at least one
innocent life. Self-defense is threatened by such schemes. And
self-defense is degraded and human lives cheapened when the
government targets crime victims, not crime perpetrators.  </p>

<p> "In fact and in law, the right to defend yourself against deadly
attack is fundamental. But if you think that right's a given, you're
being taken."</p>

<p> After several weeks of a nightmare of harassment and armed assaults
by Anthony Goree, another Marine, LCPL Ross purchased a semiautomatic
pistol for self-protection on June 26th, 1993.  For the sake of her
child, she had decided to stop running, stop hiding in the homes of
friends and neighbors, and return to her Woodbridge, Virginia,
apartment. It happened her first night home.  At 3 A.M. June 29th,
Goree broke into her apartment by literally dismantling a door and
went after Ross with a knife.  "She defended her life and that of
her infant daughter -- a clear-cut case of justifiable homicide,"
Murray said. </p>

<p> "After being stalked, harassed, beaten, attacked and held against her
will, LCPL Ross did the right thing," commented appointed counsel
Evan Roberts, Captain, U.S.M.C. "She pressed charges.  Her assailant
was arrested and confined to the brig June 15 after his armed
assault of Ross in her battalion office.  On June 21st, based on the
recommendations of a reviewing officer, Goree was released from the
brig and placed on base restriction.  Almost immediately, he absented
himself from the base.  Despite orders to avoid all contact with
Ross, he continued to stalk and harass her.  Declared an absentee,
Goree pursued her.  Despite the best efforts of the Marine Corps and
the Prince William County police, he was not found -- until his final
attack on LCPL Ross June 29th."</p>

<p> Ross's case is backed by the NRA Firearms Civil Rights Legal Defense Fund.  </p>

<h1>Man Kills Slasher</h1>

<p><A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Elgin.html">Elgin</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a>
resident George Kelly found a man with a butcher knife
waiting in his shower. The intruder, convicted burglar and child molester
Joe Lewis, lunged at Kelly, slashing him with the knife.</p>

<p>Kelly managed to retrieve his 9mm handgun and shoot Lewis in the chest.
Lewis appeared unaffected, and Kelly ran out his back door, hoping to
attract Lewis out of the house and away from his pregnant wife and their
seven-year-old daughter.</p>

<p>Lewis remained in the house, threatening Kelly's wife. Kelly ran back in,
tackled Lewis, then gathered his family upstairs. Police found the intruder
barricaded in the family's nursery. Lewis later died at a hospital, and
Kelly's slash wound required sixteen stiches to close.</p>

ripped open, spilling its contents including a .38 caliber revolver. Cole
grabbed the handgun and shot the criminal twice. Onlookers then beat and
kicked the man until police arrived.</p>

<p>Police charged the mugger with robbery, and seized Cole's revolver as
evidence. Cole immediately bought a new one.</p>

<p>"All those years I've had the gun, I never, ever thought I'd shoot
somebody," Cole said, but, "I'd do it again. You bet I would. I'm glad I
stopped him. He'll not do that again to someone else."</p>

<p>Michigan has Concealed Weapons permits, which waive the Brady Act's
waiting period. If the waiting period applied, Cole would have been
defenseless after her revolver was seized. If the weapon permit had not
been available, she would have been mugged or worse.</p>

<h1>Jealous Husband Killed</h1>

<p>Thinking he would catch his wife cheating, "Skip" Elsom burst into
Stan Parker's
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/Spokane.html">Spokane</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a> apartment
just after midnight with a

<p>Elsom burst into Parker's bedroom, snapped a photograph, raised the
baseball bat and began shooting his pistol, hitting Parker three times.
Parker, a firearms collector, returned fire with a 9mm semiautomatic
handgun, hitting Elsom in the chest. Elsom fled, collapsed on the sidewalk
and died.</p>

<p>Parker was sleeping alone.</p>

<title>Carjacker Killed</title>
<!-- Place: Coral Springs, Florida (USA) -->
<!-- Time: July 24, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Carjacker Killed By Victim</h1>

<p>July 24, 1995 Coral Springs Police Department press releases:</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/CoralSprings.html">Coral
Springs</a> [, <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a>]
Police are investigating a carjacking that resulted in the
death of one of the subjects. At approximately 7:20am, an owner of a Lexus
stopped at a car wash in the 9200 block of Wiles Road. He was approached by
a subject armed with a handgun (revolver) and was ordered at gunpoint out
of the vehicle and into the trunk.</p>

<p>The subject stopped the Lexus approximately two blocks away, fearing the
victim had a cellular phone in the trunk. (He had noticed that no phone was
visible in the passenger compartment and thought the victim may have taken
it with him when he climbed into the trunk.) When the subject opened the
trunk, the victim exited the trunk - now armed with two handguns that were
stored in the trunk (a revolver and a semiautomatic pistol). The victim
ordered the subject to ground (he told him to lie down on the ground). (The
victim also shouted to nearby pedestrians to call 911 and alert police.)</p>

<p>However the subject made a move to his pocket and in fear for his safety,
the victim shot the subject (in the lower abdomen). A second subject,
driving a blue station wagon, attempted to run down the Lexus owner (who
shot at the driver, taking out the window of the station wagon but missing
the second suspect). Officer Willie Jackson was able to provide an
accurate description of the station wagon. Officer Karl Milenkovic located
the subject in the 2000 block of University Drive and arrested him without
incident.</p>

<p>The first subject died at North Broward Medical Center.</p>

<p>Coral Springs Police have identified the suspects involved in today's
carjacking. The deceased was identified as Carl Lee Reese, DOB 10/12/73.
The second suspect was identified as Mario Danele Sikes, age 17. Both
are from 2010 Avenue G,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/FtPierce.html">Fort
Pierce</a>, <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a>.
According to investigators,
Reese had an extensive history of carjacking in Florida and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/sc/">South
Carolina</a> and was wanted in Palm Beach County for Violation of Probation
relating to robbery. Investigators are still looking into Sikes' past.
Sikes will be charged with Kidnapping and Grand Theft related offenses.</p>

<p>The victim (Lexus driver) was identified as Paul Brite, age 53 of Coral
Springs. Mr. Brite was not injured or charged in this incident.</p>

<title>92-year-old Shoots Attacker</title>
<!-- Place: September 6, 1995 -->
<!-- Time: Wheatley Heights, Long Island, New York (USA) -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>92-year-old Shoots Attacker</h1>

<p>In September 1995, 23-year-old Eric Williams broke into the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/WheatleyHeights.html">Wheatley
Heights</a>, <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a>
home of 92-year-old Conrad Schwartzkopf, pummeled the
owner and shoved him into a closet. Unfortunately for the criminal,
Schwartzkopf kept a semiautomatic handgun in that closet.</p>

<p>The bruised Schwartzkopf emerged from the closet and shot the intruder,
who fled and was later found by police bleeding in the street.</p>

<p>A handgun is the only thing in the world that will allow a frail 92-year-old
to end an attack by a hardened 24-year-old criminal. Semiautomatic handguns
are particularly suited to the elderly, as semiautos have less recoil than other
types of weapons.</p>

<p>In what is becoming a trend on the west coast, John Ayler was

<p>Out of jail only seven weeks, a convicted burglar returned to his

pounded on the door of Curtis Schnepp's <a

house, breaking the door in the process.  He also woke up
Schnepp, who was taking a nap.  Schnepp got his .357 and found the man
crawling through the door.  When the man advanced after being ordered to
stop, Schnepp fired, mortally wounding him.  Schnepp's actions were later
affirmed by the county prosecutor.</p>

Despite a well-lit house, somebody jimmied locks, slipped through the
garage, and made his way into Benny Pruden's kitchen, while the
homeowner worked on a computer upstairs. Pruden heard the refrigerator
open, but never had the chance to actually see his unwelcome guest as
the criminal or criminals instantly fled at the sound of him loading
his .308. A purse and briefcase taken from the home were found in a
neighboring yard.</p>

<p>The three intruders entered a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a>, home and were
stalking down the hall through the darkness when Robert Brown heard
one of the housebreakers say, "Somebody's here, let's get him."
Frightened but ready, Brown shot one of the thugs dead and was forced
to wound another after the criminal attempted to attack the homeowner
with a screwdriver. The wounded suspect and his unharmed accomplice
then escaped the house. The injured crook was later arrested.</p>

woman to victimize as she was preparing to go home after a long day at

doors as the bandit drew a semi-automatic pistol. Randolph had her own
.38 and fired a single on-target shot through the car's side window at
her attacker. The injured stranger fired one wild shot and fled the
scene, only to be arrested by police the next day after he attempted
to enter a home.</p>

<title>Ex-boyfriend Killed</title>

<body>

<h1>Ex-boyfriend Killed</h1>

<p>When Barbara Weaver ended her relationship with John Boyer III,
Boyer publicly threatened to kill her and himself. Weaver obtained
a protection-from-abuse order (restraining order) against Boyer,
barring him from her vicinity.</p>

<p>Weaver sought refuge in the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/Lebanon.html">Lebanon</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a> home
of Brian Scott Mase. On May 21, 1995, Boyer showed up at the Mase home, and
Weaver called the police, who made him leave (but according to
the order were supposed to arrest him).</p>

<p>Boyer later returned to the Mase home. Mase retrieved his father's
M-1A carbine rifle and told him to leave. Instead, Boyer entered and
grabbed a wooden object, which Mase thought was a baseball bat, and
Weaver thought was a skateboard.</p>

<p>Mase fired one shot, hitting Boyer in the stomach and killing him.</p>

<p>Police arrested Mase for homicide, and a judge denied him bail. Mase
will spend at least six months in jail awaiting trial. His grandparents
have sold their home to help pay for his legal defense.</p>

<p>Mase's father decided to go to the Internet for help.
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.leba.net/~rickmase/">Richard Mase</a>
has put on the World Wide Web news stories and other information about
the case.</p>

<p>District Attorney Bradford Charles, not too happy about the Internet
site, asked the judge to bar Brian Mase and his attorney from talking
to Richard Mase. The judge ruled against Charles, allowing Mase to
continue his Internet presence.</p>

<p>Tax-deductible contributions for Brian Mase's defense can be sent to the
Gun Owners Foundation, 8001 Forbes Place, Suite 102, Springfield Va. 22151.
Write "Brian Mase" in the memo field of the check. Checks can also be sent
direct to Brian's dad, although they will not be tax deductible, at Brian
Mase Defense Fund, 254 S. 12th St., rear, Lebanon, Penn. 17042.</p>

own .25 auto and aimed it at the gun-wielding robber. Backing out of
the store, the bandit joined his accomplice standing guard outside,
and fled, firing shots through the window. Pursued by Lambert and two
other business owners on foot, the delinquents jumped in a car but
were apprehended by police just three blocks away.</p>

<title>Arrested for Self-Defense</title>

<h1>Man Arrested for Self-Defense</h1>

<p>On May 15, 1995, Aaron Davis and his girlfriend were accosted by
four drunks in a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Vacaville.html">Vacaville</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> park. Davis
and his girlfriend evaded
the drunks, but two of them found them in the park, assaulted Davis,
and threatened to rape his girlfriend.</p>

<p>Davis defended himself with a Swiss Army knife, sending both attackers
to the hospital, where one of them died.</p>

<p>After investigating the matter, the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Solano.html">Solano County</a>
District Attorney's
office declined to press charges, stating that Davis had acted in self-defense
after exhausting other means of protecting himself.</p>

<p>Davis and his family immediately became the target of death threats by
friends of the attackers. Vacaville police moved Davis to a safe house
outside town.</p>

<p>Davis was fired from his job at a Vacaville grocery store after a thug
threatened to kill Davis in the store. The store manager did not want any
such retaliation to occur at the store.</p>

<p>Davis spent the two months after the knifing in and out of various safe
houses to protect his life.</p>

<p>On July 19, 1995, Davis and his girlfriend were followed home by about
five people in a car. When Davis arrived home and left his car, "Sonny"
Shairer got out of the other car and threatened Davis' life.</p>

<p>Davis pulled out a Glock .40 handgun and killed Shairer with a single
shot. The remaining thugs fled in their car.</p>

<p>The Vacaville police, instead of treating Davis as a hero, arrested
Davis and seized <em>all</em> his firearms stored in a gun safe <em>in
his house</em>. Before they would release Davis, the police forced Davis'
father to give up all <em>his</em> firearms!</p>

<p>Making a tragic situation worse, the Vacaville police have disarmed
a family who are under constant threat by local thugs.</p>

shoot back -- he did. When a man stormed into his store and pointed a
pistol at Waterman, demanding cash, the senior citizen reactively
ducked behind the counter, drew his .38, and cut loose with a shot in
the intruder's direction. Waterman missed his target, but it was
enough to send the crook bolting from the store.</p>

<p>It took <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a> Life Member

been unable to as the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Fresno.html">Fresno</a>,

than 15 home invasions and numerous robberies in which elderly
residents suffered severe beatings, the thug dove through an open
bedroom window and attacked Tiller and his wife in his typical
fashion. Untypical was the ensuing struggle where Tiller shot the
fugitive four times before the man fled the home. The criminal later
turned up in a hospital where police arrested him in connection to the
string of savage attacks.</p>

<h1>Teen Tries to Rob Gun Club</h1>

<p>"It was the easiest arrest I have ever made," said an Indiana
state policeman. A teenage runaway had already stolen one four-wheeled
ATV and hoped to steal a second from a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/in/Greenfield.html">Greenfield</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/in/">Indiana</a>,
gun club. But when the trooper arrived on the scene, he found the young
criminal begging 90-year-old club owner Dennis Kingen to put down his gun. "It
was quite a scene. Here is this 90-year-old man with his oxygen tank
holding an 18-year-old kid at bay with a handgun."</p>

<title>Wisconsin Repeals Gun Laws</title>
<!-- Place: Wisconsin (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 16, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Wisconsin repeals gun control</h1>

<p>On November 16, 1995,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wi/">Wisconsin</a> Governor
Tommy Thompson signed a law
repealing local gun control ordinances across the state, and allowing firearms
to be carried openly in public.</p>

<p>The law repeals all but two local gun control regulations. Localities
with waiting periods for handgun purchases can keep that regulation until
November 30, 1998.</p>

<p>State Attorney General and chief wanker Jim Doyle immediately called a press
conference denouncing citizens' inherent and inalienable right of self-defense
"extremely dangerous."</p>

<p>Thompson responded, "You don't see people roaming the streets, openly
waving their guns and creating mayhem ... You don't need to legislate common
sense. You can trust people." The few Wisconsin localities with laws
prohibiting open carry have never convicted anyone of doing so, he said.</p>

<p>Concealed carry will remain illegal.</p>

<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a> resident
Mark Cramer gained custody of his three

into a larger apartment.</p>

<p>When thieves stole his pickup in April 1995, he had trouble finding
transportation to get to his job on time.</p>

<p>When Customs agents recovered his pickup a month later, Cramer thought he
was lucky. Customs seized the truck in a border drug bust. The smugglers who
stole the pickup pled guilty four days after their arrest, leaving Customs
with no reason to keep the truck.</p>

<p>But the feds didn't give it back, despite repeated requests by Cramer,
a Phoenix police officer, and a Phoenix lawyer working pro bono.</p>

<p>"This happens all the time," a Customs official told him. Cramer lost his
job because he couldn't get to work. He lost his apartment because he could
no longer pay the rent. He and his family now live on the streets.</p>

<h1>Muslims Terrorize Serbs After Regaining Sarajevo</h1>

<p>Sarajevo,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Bosnia/">Bosnia</a>,
the once prestigious city that was home to the 1984 Olympics,
has seen some of the worst fighting of the <a href="index.html">Bosnian
war</a>.</p>

<p>Serbs took the city early in the war, but partly as the result of
peace talks in October 1995, transferred control of Sarajevo to the
Bosnian government in March 1996. By that time, most of the Serbs
living there had fled.
Serb leaders had warned residents of Muslim and Croat vengeance.
Other Serbs took a more forceful approach, burning apartments
and factories to leave nothing behind for the Bosnian federation.</p>

<p>In the Sarajevo suburb of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Bosnia/Ilidza.html">Ilidza</a>,
about 3,000 Serbs, mainly the elderly
and sick, stayed in Sarajevo through the transfer of power.
The predictions came true as hundreds of Muslim looters threatened, harassed,
intimidated and robbed the remaining Serbs, under the watchful eye
of international police monitors. Most of the remaining Serbs are
now planning to leave, further demolishing U.N. hopes of a
multi-ethnic Bosnia.</p>

<p>"It is a shame, really a shame, that some of the people who have come from
Sarajevo are behaving in the same appalling and outrageous manner as some of
the Serbs were before they left," said police monitor spokesman Alexander
Ivanko.</p>

<p>Serbs returning home from shopping have found their possessions carted off.
Others have had to serve meals or give bribes to marauding thugs to convince
them not to occupy their houses.</p>

suburb changes hands, Muslim scavengers reign," reprinted in the

<h1>Srebrenica</h1>

<p>Of all the inventions of government, war has caused more misery than
all others combined. War evokes the basest nature of men, and is
always and without exception accompanied by torture, massacres and rape.</p>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Bosnian war</a> is typical, although perhaps
its atrocities are better
known from its closeness to European powers and the intense interest shown
by the press and human rights organizations.</p>

<p>The Serb conquest of the Bosnian town of Srebrenica, a supposed United
Nations safe haven, exemplifies the hatred and violence of the war.</p>

<h2>Safe Haven</h2>

<p>The Bosnian war is typical of the countless petty tribal disputes
that have afflicted humanity throughout its history. Three main ethnic
groups, Serbs, Croats and Muslims, are competing for territory, some
desolate rocky soil in the shithole of Europe. For that, they ruthlessly
murder and rape each other. The Serbs have the worst reputation, probably
because they are the most successful at torture.</p>

<p>Into this atmosphere of ethnic hatred, the United Nations swaggered,
its usual busybody self, believing itself capable of mediating among the
parties. If the Serbs were capable of calm, cool deliberation, they would
be conquering the French Riviera instead of the former Yugoslavia, home
of the "Yugo," which was like a car only smaller.</p>

<p>In its wisdom, the U.N. decreed certain towns in Bosnia to be "safe
havens," where war was strictly off-limits. Srebrenica was one of those towns.
In response to the offer of U.N. protection, more than 40,000 mostly
Muslim refugees sought safe haven in Srebrenica.</p>

<h2>The Siege</h2>

<p>Dutch "peacekeepers" were assigned by the U.N. to protect Srebrenica.
The Dutch commander warned in May 1995 of signs that the Serbs were preparing
to attack, but the U.N. did not act on his warning.
Throughout June the Bosnian Serb army continued their preparations,
weakening the Dutch force by allowing troops to leave but not allowing
replacements, and by seizing supplies destined for the troops.</p>

<p>In the early morning hours of July 6, the Serbs began their attack,
firing at the U.N. compound and shelling a nearby village, continuing
their assault through the ensuing days. The Dutch asked the U.N. for a
NATO airstrike against the Serb artillery, but the request was rejected.</p>

<p>The U.N. was trying to get the Serbs to agree to peace talks, and
did not want to give the Serbs reason to reject talks. In order to
keep the Serbs in peace talks, they allowed the Serbs to conduct war
against Srebrenica, a rather contradictory stance best described as
accomodation.</p>

<p>By July 9, the Serbs were directly attacking the safe area. In a
scene blending the modern and the eternal, the U.N. commander faxed
the Serbian General Ratko Mladic warning him to stop his attack. The
Serbs ignored the warning, penetrating to the center of Srebrenica,
falling back from a Dutch blockade only under a hail of machine gun fire.</p>

<p>The U.N. commander for Bosnia, General Bernard Janvier, decided
not to act against the Serbs, despite his advisers' recommendation
for air strikes. The Dutch mistakenly believed Janvier had ordered an
air strike for the morning of July 11, and again warned the Serbs to
leave.</p>

<h2>The Fall</h2>

<p>When morning broke on July 11, 1995, in Srebrenica, the Serbs held their
positions, but stopped shelling the town. By 11 a.m., it was apparent that
there would be no air strike, and the Serbs renewed their attack.</p>

<p>At this point, Janvier finally approved a air strike, but it was limited
to four planes which only managed to damage one tank. Thousands of Serb
soldiers stormed the city, seizing Dutch peacekeepers as hostages and
threatening to kill them if air strikes were not called off. The U.N.
yielded to the Serb threat, and the Serbs assumed control of Srebrenica.</p>

<p>15,000 Muslims fled Srebrenica, attempting the three-day journey
through Serb territory to areas not yet overrun. The remaining
25,000 refugees jammed a Dutch camp in the town of Potocari.</p>

<h2>The Massacre</h2>

<p>On the night of July 11, 1995, the Serbs began their massacre of
Muslims. They shot at least nine refugees at the Potocari camp, and
allegedly raped several of the women. Over the succeeding days, the
Serbs would massacre as many as eight thousand people.</p>

<p>Survivors and Serbian civilians living near Srebrenica confirmed
the bloody details. Human rights observers, the press and military spy
missions corroborated the stories.</p>

<p>On July 12, the Serbs, led by Mladic, herded the refugees onto
trucks and buses, separating the men from the women.
The men were driven to Serb border towns, and crammed into warehouses,
schools and abandoned buildings. The Serbs pulled men at random from
the buildings, took them outside, beat some of them and killed others.</p>

<p>The Serbs then began driving the Muslims in groups of 25 to 30 out
into the fields, lining them up in small groups, and shooting them.
A handful of men survived by hiding under the dead bodies.</p>

<p>The refugees that fled Potocari were hunted down and killed in
a similar manner.</p>

<p>Among the evidence of the Serb atrocities are U.S. reconnaissance
satellite photographs. One photo shows hundreds of Muslims held in
fields at gunpoint on July 13; a U-2 spy plane photographed fresh graves
in the same fields two weeks later. Intelligence agencies collect far
more data than they can analyze, however, and the CIA required survivors'
testimony to help focus their efforts on thousands of images in certain
areas, finally presenting the pictures to U.S. President Clinton on
August 4.</p>

<h2>War Goes On</h2>

<p>During the first week of August 1995, the Croatian army reconquered
Croatia's Krajina region from the Serbs, sending Serb forces into retreat.
Srebrenica now serves as a home for Serbian refugees from the Croatian
attack.</p>

<p>In September, NATO airstrikes pummeled Serbian heavy weapons in
Sarajevo. The Serbs agreed to participate peace talks in October.</p>

<title>Bond Defeated</title>
<!-- Place: Atlanta, Georgia (USA) -->

<body>
<h1>Atlanta Bond Referendum Defeated</h1>

<p>From an article by Susan Laccetti in the March 10, 1994 Atlanta
<cite>Constitution</cite>, p. G3:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It may have been
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/Atlanta.html">Atlanta</a>
mayor Bill Campbell who pulled the plug on the city's
$149 million bond referendum, but it probably wouldn't have happened without
the dogged persistance of lawyer Bob Proctor, 35.</p>

<p>"My personal objective is to reduce the role of government in our world,"
said the self described Libertarian.</p>

<p>Not only was he the attorney who filed suit against the special bond
election
scheduled for tuesday, but he ... led the 1991 taxpayer revolt.</p>

<p>Proctor is state chair of the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a>
Association of Taxpayers, a 10,000
member group that filed suit and stopped the tax on private sales of
automobiles. That case resulted in 150,000 refunds to Georgia taxpayers last
fall.</p>

<title>Jon Coon Editorial</title>
<!-- Place: Detroit, Michigan (USA) -->
<!-- Time: June 19, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Editorial Favorable to Libertarian</h1>

<p>Editorial from the Sunday, June 19, 1994
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/Detroit.html">Detroit</a>
<cite>News and Free Press</cite>, posted by George Weeks, whose comments
appear in brackets:</p>

<p>It's been a struggle for all of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi">Michigan's</a> candidates
for U.S. Senate to get much attention during what has been a yawner of 
a campaign.</p>

<p>Libertarian contender Jon Coon has an added struggle: to avoid 
being ignored by rival candidates, the press and sponsors of 
joint forums.</p>

<p>Coon is waging the best campaign I can recall by a third-party 
state-wide candidate in Michigan. That's not saying much, 
considering the lack of minor party successes.</p>

<p>Nationwide, 116 Libertarians -- including some state legislators --
hold public office. None won in Michigan or on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>When asked on a June 3 Off the Record public TV show about 
failure of previous Libertarian candidates here, feisty Coon 
snapped: "Ever see one campaign as hard as I have?"</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Coon strikes me as a cross between Ross Perot and Gen. George 
"Blood & Guts" Patton.</p>

<p>Like formula-man Perot, Coon speaks in sound-bite spurts and 
says the two big parties aren't getting the job done: "There is 
no fiscally conservative party left in Washington. ...Help me 
break this country's addiction to big government. ...I can get 
something done. ...We're freedom and responsibility-driven."</p>

<p>Like Patton, the former Michigan National Guard platoon leader 
has blazing eyes and takes no guff.</p>

<p>Asked about the new ban on assault weapons, this hard-charging 
disciple of the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National Rifle
Association</a> insists they are "defense weapons."</p>

<p>He's sorry he voted for John Engler for governor and calls his 
school-reform Proposal A "a bad joke on the people of this state."</p>

<p>Concluding a Memorial Day appearance on WJR's Kevin Joyce Show, 
Coon said of the two Republicans and six Democrats seeking 
gubernatorial [Weeks probably means senatorial] nominations: 
"We'll be waiting -- guns lowered -- for them to come out of this 
(Aug. 2) primary."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Coon, who has raised about $50,000 [That was then!],
is running some campaign commercials. A TV spot that ends with 
Coon's anti-big government pitch begins with dollars being 
flushed down a toilet.</p>

<p>As evidenced by his WJR and public TV appearances, Coon is 
getting some exposure. But he gets shut out of such traditional 
forums as the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce's recent 
Mackinac Island conference, to which all major party candidates 
were invited.</p>

<p>The chamber rejected an appeal by Comerica Bank Vice-President
David Littman, who said Coon has qualified for the Nov. 8 ballot 
and "is staunchly pro-business and pro-market. He is a defender 
of private property rights and speaks eloquently on behalf of a 
better business climate."</p>

<p>Although I occasionally cover Libertarians and other minor party 
candidates, they certainly don't get equal treatment here. They 
get note, but not top billing.</p>

<p>This is not a space of record, but of opinion.</p>

<p>In a June 14 column on women running for Congress, I said: "It's
conceivable that on Nov. 8, there will be a faceoff between two
women in the U.S. Senate race" -- Democrat Lana Pollack and 
Republican Ronna Romney.</p>

<p>That day, I got a fax from Coon aide Bill Shotey: "Correction...
(it) will NOT be a faceoff between two women. It will be a THREE-
WAY race with Jon Coon & the two survivors."</p>

<p>And Coon will finish third. Still, his agressive, guns-lowered
campaign merits note. Today, it's top billing.</p>

<h1>Bosnia</h1>

<P>Okay, let's see, the Balkans are called "the tinderbox of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>" for
its residents' tendency to kill each other, let's get the
world's superpowers involved in a conflict there.</p>

<p>Serbs, Croats and Muslims have been fighting each other in the Balkans
for hundreds of years. With the collapse of Yugoslavia, they began pouncing
on each other once again. NATO, the U.N. and other nincompoops felt a moral
obligation to get themselves killed as well.</p>

<p>One of the many complications in all this is that the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russians</a> have been ethnic
allies of the Serbs for hundreds of years, and don't take kindly to Western

<h1>Yeltsin Warns of European War Over Bosnia</h1>

<p>As NATO conducted an air assault of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Bosnia/">Bosnian</a> Serbs,
<A href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russian</a>
President Boris
Yeltsin warned that continued military intervention by Western nations would
result in a new war in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>.</p>

<p>"In future we will have to respond adequately and help the Serbs," Yeltsin
said. "I have already signed a decree on humanitarian assistance. If these
attacks continue, then things will become much hotter ...
Those who insist on the expansion of NATO are making a major
political mistake. The flame of war would ignite across all of Europe."</p>

<p>Yeltsin's tirade is probably hot air to appease reactionary forces in
the Soviet, excuse me, Russian government, but that very fact points up the
instability of Russia's political situation.</p>

<p>Even when you don't consider the futility of intervening in a centuries
old religious and ethnic conflict, is it worth risking a nuclear war to
intervene in some backward global outhouse of a region?</p>

NATO," reprinted in the September 9, 1995 <cite>News and Observer</cite>.</p>

<title>U.N. Budget Crisis</title>
<!-- Place: global -->
<!-- Time: 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>U.N. Almost as Financially Bankrupt as Morally</h1>

<p>In February 1996, the <a href="index.html">United Nations</a>
had a two-year budget of $2.6 billion, but faced a financial crisis
that may cause it to lay off some of its 13,000 leeches, I mean
professional and clerical employees, to prevent bankruptcy.
A U.N. advisory panel
recommended cutting 600 general nonprofessional staff (10% of
the total) and 550 professional staff (14%), freezing recruitment,
and not renewing short-term employment contracts.</P>

<p>Member countries "owed" the U.N. $2.1 billion at the end of 1995,
over half of that from the
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/">United States</a> alone.
U.N. dues are based
on "from each according to his ability" such that U.S. payments make
up 25% of the total.</p>

<p>Some U.N. proponents advocate a global income tax as a way to
reduce U.N. "dependency" on member governments.</p>

<hr>

<p>Source: February 5, 1996 Reuter Information Service article,
"UN considers cutting 1,100 staff in budget crisis," reprinted in
the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NandO.html">NandO Times</a>.</p>

<h1>Sexual and Reproductive Freedom</h1>

<p>Reproductive (or sexual) freedom covers many issues, including birth
control, sexual preference, abortion and forced sterilization. Libertarians
are divided on the abortion issue (depends on whether one considers the fetus
an individual); the Libertarian Party platform is pro-choice.</p>

<h1>Drug Policy</h1>

<dl>

<dt><a href="moral/">Drug prohibition is morally wrong.</a></dt>
<dd><p>With origins in bigotry and racism, and sustained by the use of force,
drug prohibition is a violation of the most basic human rights.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="usage/">Prohibition affects drug usage for the worse.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Prohibition leads to more dangerous drugs, and has a "forbidden fruit"
effect, but whether lax or tough has little effect on patterns of drug
usage.</p>

<dt><a href="users/">Drug users are worse off under prohibition.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Although intended to protect people from drugs, prohibition worsens the
situation of drug users, increasing criminality and health problems.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="sellers/">Drug sellers are more dangerous under
	prohibition.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Prohibition enriches the worst criminals and leads to more
violence.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="legal/">Prohibition corrupts the judicial system.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Due to prohibition's nature, drug enforcement inevitably leads to
overburdened courts and jails, fewer resources devoted against violent crime,
and corruption at all levels.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="rights/">Prohibition leads to destruction of other
	liberties.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Faced with failure, prohibitionists seek more and more infringements
of individual liberties, from restricting speech to banning guns, from
more intrusive searches to higher taxes.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="effects/">Prohibition deprives us of beneficial drug use.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Prohibition discourages promising drug research, denies medically
proven uses of recreational drugs, eliminates beneficial industrial uses
of drug sources. Relying on an image of evil drugs, prohibition propaganda
spreads ignorance of the true effects of drugs.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="critics/">Prohibition's critics come from all viewpoints.</a></dt>
<dd><p>As prohibition's failure becomes evident, voices from all points on the
political spectrum speak out against it, from Nobel Prize-winning economists
to conservative columnists and former police chiefs.</p></dd>

<h2><cite>Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do</cite></h2>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/M/PeterMcWilliams.html">Peter McWilliams</a>
has written a masterful book exposing the follies of prohibition for
what they are. <cite>Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do: The Absurdity of
Consensual Crimes in a Free Society</cite> "marshals a vast army of anecdotes,
quotes, statistics and assertions to argue that America would be a lot
better off if we stopped using the force of law to save each other from
drugs, alcohol, gambling, pornography, suicide and sex in its more exotic
flavors," according to the New York <cite>Times</cite>.</p>

<p>The book is fun to read and even browse, as compelling and/or witty
quotes are scattered about everywhere.</p>

<p>McWilliams, in the spirit of creativity unleashed, has put the
entire contents of <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.mcwilliams.com/books/aint/f01.htm"><cite>Nobody's
Business</cite></a> online. Highly recommended.</p>

<title>Chinese Reproductive Policy</title>
<!-- Place: China -->
<!-- Time: report 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Reproductive Policy in China</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JayManifold.html">Jay Manifold</a>:</p>

<p>Millions of Chinese men and women have been forcibly aborted or sterilized 
under <a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China's</a> "population
control policy."  Hundreds of victims have fled to
America to spare their child's life or who fear their own safety.</p>

<p>Since the Clinton Administration agrees with China's one-child policy, 
refusing to consider it persecution, these immigrants have been held in 
prisons throughout America for almost 2 years.  Their families in China have 
been harshly punished, with fines of up to several years' wages, or their 
homes bulldozed.</p>

<p>First-hand accounts of the one-child policy reveal the inhumane treatement,
including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Incarcerating pregnant women in barracks until they acquiesce to 
abortions and/or sterilizations.

<li>Handcuffing mothers in their last trimester, herding them into cages
and delivering them by the truckload to the operating tables of
abortion clinics.

<li>Carrying out sterilization or abortion without the consent or 
knowledge of the women.

<li>Crushing the skulls of infants with forceps during delivery or 
injecting iodine, alcohol, or formaldehyde into their soft spots as 
they are crowning so that they are born dead.

<li>Cutting off food, electricity, water and wages for couples who refuse
to comply.

<li>Confiscating the furniture, livestock, and even homes of families who
refuse to comply.

<li>Demolishing the homes of those who refuse to comply.

<li>Physical torture of those who refuse to comply.
</ul>

<p>On February 14, 1995, the Chinese government announced a new campaign of
even more rigorous enforcement of the one-child policy.</p>

<p>Federal authorities from the Department of Justice and the INS have used 
deceitful, unethical, and perhaps illegal actions to keep the immigrants in 
jail and to quietly deport them.  The Clinton administration not only supports
China's one-child policy, they subsidize it with tax dollars through foreign
aid for "family planning."</p>

<p>On February 27, 1995, the Fifth Circuit Appellate Court denied the
immigrants' plea for asylum.  They now face deportation back to China, and
certain torture.</p>

<title>Immorality of Drug Prohibition</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Immorality of Drug Prohibition</h1>

<p>Prohibition of recreational drugs is morally wrong. Far from a noble cause,
drug prohibition has its roots in <a href="bigotry.html">bigotry and
hatred</a>. Prohibition is a <a href="rights.html">violation of individual
rights</a>.</p>

<p>While prohibition of drug use is wrong, that does not affect whether drug
use is itself right or wrong. It means, rather, that drug use is a moral
decision made by the individual without the threat of force.</p>

<title>Drug Usage</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Drug Usage</h1>

<p>Drug prohibition leads to more dangerous drugs, and slightly encourages
drug use through constant advertisement and the "forbidden fruit" effect.
Despite this, and despite the "toughness" of enforcement, drug prohibition
has little effect on broad patterns of drug usage.</p>

<h2>Prohibition = More Concentrated Drugs</h2>

<p>The economics of smuggling lead smugglers to seek more concentrated
forms of drugs. Thus, during alcohol Prohibition in the U.S., we had
"bathtub gin" and "bootleg whiskey:" harder forms of alcohol were favored
over more moderate drinks such as beer and wine. When opium was made illegal,
smugglers switched first to morphine and later to heroin. When cocaine was
made illegal, smugglers switched from relatively mild coca drinks to powder
cocaine and later smokable (crack) cocaine. Since marijuana was made illegal,
its potency has steadily increased.</p>

<p>With legalization, people generally prefer moderate drug usage. Since
Prohibition, hard alcohol usage has declined in favor of beer and wine, which
are actually beneficial to health in moderation. "Tar" content in tobacco
(a legal drug, today) declined steadily after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
allowed tobacco companies to compete on that basis. When other recreational
drugs were legal, relatively few users chose the most concentrated forms.</p>

<h2>Prohibition Encourages Drug Use</h2>

<p>Although explicitly condemning drug use, prohibition often has the
unintended side effect of promoting drug use among certain parts of the
population.</p>

<p>Teenagers naturally rebel against authority figures and mandates of any
sort. Prohibition, with its "Because I told you so" logic, sets up a
"forbidden fruit" effect, turning drug usage into a statement of rebellion.</p>

<p>Prohibitionists are dependent on publicity to keep the public convinced that
their efforts are needed. As such, drug users and dealers get much more
publicity than they would under legalization. Many groups have documented
increases in drug usage with increases in publicity. See, for example, Consumer
Reports' <cite>Licit and Illicit Drugs</cite> for how one newspaper managed to
spread "glue sniffing" to the entire country.</p>

<p>Use of the drug Ecstasy peaked years <em>after</em> it was
made illegal in 1985. This may partially be attributed to the "forbidden
fruit" effect and the widespread publicity the drug received after becoming
illegal.</p>

<p>Another side effect of prohibition is to cause some users to switch from
more-prosecuted drugs to less-prosecuted ones. Thus, when marijuana laws are
strongly enforced, use of hard alcohol goes up. When cocaine enforcement was
strengthened, heroin made a comeback.</p>

<h2>Prohibition Matters Little</h2>

<p>In the end, though, prohibition's effects on drug usage are small. Drug
usage is a culturally determined phenomenon, mainly out of the realm of
government policy.</p>

<p>Marijuana laws vary considerably across the U.S. and across <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>. Some
states and countries have strict laws, others have decriminalized or even
legalized personal marijuana use. Yet marijuana use is fairly constant across
the U.S. and across Western Europe.</p>

<p>One of the most frequently cited "arguments" of prohibitionists is that
"England tried legalizing heroin, and the use skyrocketed." What is so amazing
is that prohibitionists, having no real logic to back their claims, are
reduced to deception about an incident clearly favoring legalization.</p>

<p>England did legalize heroin (with a doctor's prescription) -- in the 1920's.
Heroin use did skyrocket -- in the 1960's. If legalization causes increased
drug use, it sure has one hell of a time lag.</p>

<p>What prohibitionists never get around to telling you is that heroin use
skyrocketed <em>even more</em> in the U.S. during the same time period,
despite strict law enforcement efforts. Nor do they say that the British
heroin users had lower overdose rates, less criminal behavior and less
public dependency than users under the U.S.'s prohibitionary regime.</p>

<p>The perennial prohibitionists' solution to their failure is to get
"tougher." In addition to the instances above, history provides numerous
examples of the failure of being "tough." <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China</a> once beheaded opium users and
sold their families into slavery. I cannot imagine a tougher policy, yet opium
use in China continued. Many Muslim countries today hang drug dealers -- and
continue to do so (it hasn't stopped).</p>

<P>As further evidence against the "get tough" argument, prisons still
have high levels of illegal drug use. For example, the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a> governor's office
did a study that found illicit drugs in the bloodstream of 11% - 24% of
Ohio's prison population. If drugs can't be kept out of jail, how can they
be kept out of anywhere else?</p>

<title>Drug Users</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Drug Users</h1>

<p>Drug users are clearly worse off under prohibition than under legalization.
Under prohibition, users have more criminal activity, more health problems
and less opportunity to improve their lives.</p>

<h2>Drug Users Under Prohibition</h2>

<p>Prohibition increases the cost of the drugs made illegal. This causes many
addicts, who otherwise could have supported their habit, to rob and steal, or
go on welfare, to get enough money.</p>

<p>Under prohibition, users must obtain their drugs from criminals, since
organized crime generally ends up distributing illegal substances. Thus,
users associate with violent criminals and are more likely to commit crime
themselves.</p>

<p>Criminal justice scholars have often noted that there is a psychological
barrier to breaking the law. It is much easier for a person to commit a second
crime than a first one. Making drug use illegal puts drug users in the position
of already having broken a law -- often a law with harsher penalties than
violent crimes such as robbery and theft. This makes users more likely to
commit other types of crime.</p>

<p>In the black market, there is little recourse for disputes other than
violence. If a drug seller commits fraud, or otherwise injures a user, the
user's only hope for compensation is violent confrontation. Most "drug murders"
are not the result of drug usage, but disputes over drug deals.</p>

<p>Because illegal drugs are sold on the black market, users cannot be sure of
what they are actually purchasing. In fact, black market drugs are often
tainted ("cut") with other, sometimes harmful, substances. This is the primary
reason overdoses are common under prohibition but rare under legalization.
Users are more at a health risk because drugs are illegal. Drugs' illegality
also tends to make them more concentrated, often a health hazard.</p>

<p>Because drug paraphrenalia is often illegal, intravenous drug users
sometimes share needles, leading to increased rates of diseases including
AIDS.</p>

<p>Users are also worse off under prohibition because companies cannot
perform some drug research, and so are unable to discover less addictive
or less harmful alternatives.</p>

<p>Prohibition discourages users from seeking help. If a user seeks medical
or other forms of help, he runs the risk of being turned over to the
authorities, or of losing access to his drug. Many users are unwilling to
face the struggle of overcoming addiction if those barriers remain.</p>

<p>If a drug user does manage to stay out of criminal activity, and avoid
health hazards, his life may still be destroyed if his drug usage is found
out. Serving even a short prison sentence will disrupt the user's family,
make it harder to find a job, and bring the user into contact with the most
violent criminals.</p>

<h2>Drug Users Under Legalization</h2>

<p>Under legalization, the future is much brighter.</p>

<p>Drug users have ready, inexpensive access to their drug, allowing them to
support their habit even on a slight income. See, for example, the difference
in users who were able to obtain drugs legally through England's <a
href="/revolution/body/drugs/usage/liverpool.html">Liverpool
clinic</a> or through methadone clinics in the U.S.</p>

<p>Under legalization, users buy drugs from stores, never coming into contact
with organized crime. Fraud and labeling laws apply, so users can be sure of
what they are getting, leading to fewer health problems. Disputes are settled
in the courts rather than in the streets.</p>

<p>Drug users will have more choice, and history shows that they will favor
less concentrated (usually less harmful) forms of their drug: beer and wine
instead of liquor, coca tea instead of powder cocaine.</p>

<p>Drug users who seek help will have no barriers to doing so. There will be
no threat of punishment, no penalty for failing.</p>

<h2>Drug Users and Society</h2>

<p>Prohibitionists rely on demonizing drug users and dealers in order to
justify the inhuman treatment proposed for them. In reality, drug users make
many useful contributions to society, even when their personal lives falter.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>American Indians. Many American Indian tribes of the southwest used
peyote, a hallucinogenic cactus, in religious ceremonies. This cultural
practice continues in many tribes today.</p></li>

<li><p>Edgar Allen Poe. Wracked by alcohol and opium abuse for most of his
short adult life, Poe nevertheless earned an esteemed place in literary
history. He invented the modern detective story and defined the horror
story. His works are mandatory reading in many U.S. classrooms.</p></li>

<li><p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge. His most famous poem was written under the
influence of opium. Though an addict, he was able to support his habit legally,
without resort to crime or dependency, and led a productive life.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="/revolution/by_name/E/AlbertEinstein.html">Albert
Einstein</a>. A confirmed tobacco user, the preeminent physicist
is responsible for some of the greatest scientific advances of the
twentieth century. Einstein opposed alcohol Prohibition in the U.S.</p></li>

<li><p>Jack Nicholson. The award-winning actor and director took part in
LSD experiments while the drug was still legal.</p></li>

<li><p>The Beatles. The band that defined sixties rock'n'roll experimented
widely with marijuana and LSD. Their seminal album, <cite>Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band</cite>, was partly inspired by their discovery of
LSD use. The Beatles' members were among a large group of Britons who took
out full-page newspaper ads advocating marijuana legalization.</p></li>

<li><p>Jimi Hendrix. The groundbreaking psychedelic/blues guitarist used
marijuana and LSD, and died after taking (legal) sleeping pills. Despite

<li><p>Hunter S. Thompson. The prototypical "gonzo journalist" was well known
for his excessive drug use.</p></li>

<li><p>John Belushi. The great comedian eventually died of a drug overdose.
Belushi did whatever drugs he could find: marijuana, LSD, cocaine, heroin.
Despite his self-destructive habits (not limited to drugs), Belushi contributed
to American film with such comedic classics as <cite>Animal House</cite> and
<cite>The Blues Brothers</cite>.</p></li>

<li><p>Al Gore. The Vice President admitted to smoking marijuana in college
(including inhaling).</p></li>

<li><p>Bill Clinton. The President admits to smoking marijuana but not to

</ul>

<p>Of course there are many more, countless examples of people who led
productive lives in spite of recreational drug use. With over thirty million
users of illegal drugs in the United States alone, it is obvious that drug
users are present in every level of society, including doctors and lawyers,
teachers and politicians.</p>

<title>Drug Sellers</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Drug Sellers</h1>

<p>Drug sellers are a menace under prohibition, but a peaceful contributor
to the economy under legalization.</p>

<h2>Drug Sellers Under Prohibition</h2>

<p>Prohibition provides a major source of income for organized crime. Under
prohibition, drug sellers most likely to succeed are those who can evade
police best and who are most ruthless dealing with competitors. This is
natural territory for organized crime.</p>

<p>Prohibition concentrates drug industry profits. Contrary to popular belief,
the drug industry as a whole is not highly profitable. Instead, profits are
highly concentrated in the most successful sellers. Most drug sellers
barely make enough -- and sometimes not enough -- to support their own
habit. Sellers are constantly being ripped off or killed by other sellers,
when they're not in jail.  The drug industry is not kind to most sellers.</p>

<p>The minority of drug sellers who are successful, however, make spectacular
profits. Their prominent and glamorous example encourages others to try to
emulate them. At most risk are those with few legal alternatives, those who
expect to make around the minimum wage, or be jobless. Prohibition, by
concentrating drug industry profits, tempts many poor teenagers into a
violent life.</p>

<p>Prohibition provides a source of funding for guerilla groups in
hot spots worldwide, including the <a href="triangle.html">Golden Triangle</a>
of southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Drug Sellers Under Legalization</h2>

<p>Under legalization, the drug industry becomes another part of the economy.
Disputes between competitors are settled in court, not in the street.
Organized crime loses its advantage -- and its funding. Profits are evened
out by legal competition, so that drug dealing no longer presents a glamorous
example to struggling youth.</p>

<title>Drugs and the Legal System</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Drugs and the Legal System</h1>

<p>Prohibition leads to overcrowded prisons, overloaded courts, less
enforcement against violent crimes, and corruption at every level of
the legal system.</p>

<p>Criminalizing an activity that so much of the population participates in
can only lead to overcrowded prisons. There are more marijuana users in the
U.S. than there are Catholics. Even doubling or tripling the amount of prison
space would not help imprison more than a slight fraction of drug users.</p>

<p>When prisons fill up, prisoners must be released. In many cases, violent
criminals are let out before nonviolent drug offenders. Plea-bargaining,
suspended sentences and early releases for violent criminals are all a
direct result of increased drug law enforcement.</p>

<p>Similarly, courts are burdened with drug cases. To speed up the process,
courts are forced to deal lightly with violent criminals, through such means as
plea-bargaining.</p>

<p>Police must allocate their limited resources among various law enforcement
efforts. Seizure laws and political pressure ensure that drug enforcement
receives funding at the expense of efforts to stop violent crime.</p>

<p>The amount of money involved in the drug trade leads to corruption at all
levels: police, lawyers, judges, politicians. Police <a href="lying.html">lie
to make drug arrests</a> because actual evidence is hard to come by when
there is no victim to file a complaint.</p>

<dd><p>The annals of drug enforcement are filled with examples of violence
against innocent individuals.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="express/">Prohibition threatens freedom of expression.</a></dt>
<dd><p>Because supporters of drug rights have truth and logic on their side,
prohibitionists often resort to trying to censor their opponents. Religious
freedom is threatened when drugs are used in ceremonies (such as peyote
for American Indians, marijuana for Rastafarians and wine for
Catholics).</p></dd>

<dt>Prohibition threatens gun rights.</dt>
<dd><p>Because prohibition leads to increased violence, prohibitionists
inevitably try to control violence through gun control.</p></dd>

<dt>Drug prohibition inevitably leads to other prohibitions.</dt>
<dd><p>Faced with prohibition's failure, prohibitionists seek more
prohibition. <a href="needles.html">Needles</a>, pipes, laughing gas,
lab beakers, perfume vials, and public pay phones have all been
prohibited in a vain attempt to control drugs.</p></dd>

<dt>Prohibition threatens security in your person and property.</dt>
<dd><p>Because prohibition can only be enforced through invasive measures,
drug enforces continually try to expand their authority to search, spy and
seize, without legal constraints. Attempts at <a

<dt>Prohibition violates equal protection of law.</dt>
<dd><p>Since drug law violations are so widespread, drug laws can only be
enforced selectively. In practice, that means minorities are discriminated
against.</p></dd>

<dt><a href="/revolution/body/drugs/moral/rights.html">Drug
	prohibition is itself a violation of the right to control your own

<title>Benefits of Drugs</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Benefits of Drugs</h1>

<p>Another deleterious effect of drug prohibition is that we lose the
benefits of drugs that are made illegal. Almost every drug that can be
abused, can also be used beneficially for other purposes. Because
prohibition relies on an image of drugs as unmitigated evil, anti-drug
propaganda distorts the true effects -- positive and negative -- of drugs.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="hemp/">Marijuana</a></li>
<li><a href="tobacco/">Tobacco</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Prohibition discourages research into categories of drugs that have
been banned, taking away from us discoveries that might help medicine,
or that might prove to be less harmful alternatives to existing
recreational drugs.</p>

<p>Many illegal drugs have medicinal uses. Alcohol in moderation lessens
the risk of heart disease. Heroin is the only painkiller effective for certain
terminal diseases including cancers. Marijuana can halt the progress of
glaucoma and combat nausea caused by chemotherapy or prescription drugs.
MDMA (Ecstasy) showed promise for treating some psychological problems.
If you are one day afflicted by one of these ailments, do you want your
choices in cures limited by legislative decree?</p>

<title>Drug War Critics</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Critics of Drug Prohibition</h1>

<p>Libertarians have always been foremost among opponents of drug prohibition.
Psychologist <a href="/revolution/by_name/S/ThomasSzasz.html">Thomas Szasz</a>,
economist <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/MiltonFriedman.html">Milton
Friedman</a> and <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html"><cite>Reason</cite>
magazine</a> have all given eloquent arguments in favor of drug freedom.</p>

<p>Libertarians aren't the only ones calling for reform. Many prominent figures
have signed the Hoover Institution's <a href="hoover.html">Hoover
Resolution</a> calling for a national commission to study drug war
alternatives. Among the many people criticizing drug prohibition
are the <a href="sanchez.html">President of Bolivia</a>, the
<a href="bushnell.html">President of the American Bar Association</a>,
the <a href="mutter.html">President of the American Judges Association</a>,
and Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke.</p>

<p>When then-Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders declared drug legalization should
be studied, Republicans and Democrats alike denounced her. The Libertarian
Party issued a <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.bradley.edu/campusorg/libertarian/lpdocs/releases/LPDefendsElders.html">1993
news release</a> supporting her call.</p>

<p>Support for medical use of marijuana has increased dramatically.
In 1994, localities cities passed resolutions supporting medical marijuana,
including <a href="breckenridge.html">Breckenridge, Colorado</a>,
<a href="frisco.html">Frisco, Colorado</a>, and
<a href="alameda.html">Alameda County, California</a>. In 1996, the
states of California and Arizona passed initiatives legalizing
medical marijuana. In 1997, the prestigious New England Journal of
Medicine <a href="jom.html">endorsed medical marijuana</a>.</p>

<h1>Quotes on Drugs and Drug Policy</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Einstein on Prohibition</h2>

<p>The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably
by the Prohibition law. For nothing is more destructive of respect
for the government and the law of the land than passing laws
which cannot be enforced. It is an open secret that the dangerous
increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this.</p>

<p> - <a href="/revolution/by_name/E/AlbertEinstein.html">Albert Einstein</a>,
"My First Impression of the U.S.A.", 1921</p>

<h2>Einstein on Pipes</h2>

<p>I believe that pipe smoking contributes to a somewhat calm and objective
judgment in all human affairs.</p>

<h2>Twain on Cigars</h2>

<title>Morality of Drug Policy</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: current -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Morality and Drug Policy</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/ThomasRush.html">Thomas Rush</a>:</p>

<p>If you are interested in my background, here it is.  My mother
raised us in a Christian household -- evangelical, fundamentalist, 
almost 'holy roller,' if that means anything to you.  I believed (of
course!) that drugs should be illegal; after all, they were dangerous.</p>

<p>At some point, though, I remember that I started to believe that you
couldn't make someone go to heaven by controlling their behavior -- people
were saved by what they thought and believed, and their actions and lives
changed to match those beliefs. And so I started to question the laws we
have which try to enforce morality: the laws against drugs, and homosexuality,
and nudity, and prostitution, and a seemingly endless stream of others.</p>

<p>I also started to see some of the information about how prohibition didn't
work -- how alcohol consumption went <em>up</em> (and went down again after
repeal). How the money involved in illegal alcohol provided organized crime
its foothold (in fact, probably, its reason for being). How the murder rate
went up through prohibition and dropped starting soon after repeal. The
tremendous jump in alcohol-related diseases from bathtub gin and
overindulgence that began with the advent of prohibition, and how those
same diseases and their deaths tapered off when alcohol became legal again.</p>

<p>In short, I saw that my earlier views of why we have these laws, and of
their effects, were not consistent with reality. I very definitely remember
reading, at about age twelve, an argument for treating drug addiction as a
health problem, not a legal problem. At that time, I thought the idea was one of
the most ludicrous ever -- these people were criminals!  My views on this
changed as I began to see that there was a difference between what drug
users did to themselves by choice, and illegal things they did to others
to support their habits.</p>

<p>Since then, I have discovered what I find to be the single most damning
piece of evidence against our current drug laws: if we have been unable to keep
illegal drugs out of our prisons, how, then, can we keep illegal drugs out
of a free society?</p>

<p>There is an increasing number of people who support drug legalization, from
a surprisingly broad spectrum of society. They include conservative columnist 
William Safire, the Democratic governor of Baltimore, some Federal judges,
a number of think tanks, and lots of "just plain folks."</p>

<p>Someone once said to me, "Drug addictions destroy lives, often without the
victim's knowledge. A very good friend of mine is addicted to pot. He's been
smoking for several years, always claiming he's not addicted, that it's just
fun, but his life is getting consistently destroyed, and he lacks the ambition
he used to have. His status has gradually gone from upper middle-class to
nearly poor, and he's far from unique."</p>

<p>This brings up two of the things that I think would be just plain silly
about the war on drugs, if they weren't so frightening.  First, that
friend chooses to smoke pot regardless of the laws now in place. How
much more draconian do they need to be made before he'll quit? How
strict a law, how fierce the punishment should we enact to keep someone
from consuming a substance if there is no force or fraud involved in his
decision to consume it?</p>

<p>Second, if he's in bad shape now in his drift from the middle class, just
pray that he doesn't get arrested. There are people, many people, who have
had their lives shattered not because their drug use was out of control,
but because of their arrest for drug use. As long as this is only a
personal problem, he can decide to get medical treatment, and can get
back into the middle class. The moment it becomes a legal problem, and he
is arrested, he'll be lucky if he can ever be whole again.</p>

<p>This person continued, "Many addicts end up on welfare or homeless. They
become dependent invalids, which our society must care for, whether we want
to or not, because poor people will turn to violence for basic necessities
if they are not provided."</p>

<p>This involves several points: 1) Drug addicts have a higher incidence of
homelessness and are more likely to be on welfare than the population as
a whole; 2) Drug addicts become dependent invalids; 3) Our society must
provide for drug addicts; and 4) If society does not provide for drug addicts,
they will turn to violence to keep themselves alive.</p>

<p>My response:</p>

<p>I have no problem with point 1. I think that statistics show that alcohol
abusers are also <em>much</em> more likely to be homeless than the general
population. Does this mean that we should recriminalize alcohol?</p>

<p>Examining the second point shows it to be false. Over fifty million people
in this country have smoked marijuana. Very few of those are dependent on
society for support, or invalids. I agree that some people do become
addicted to illegal drugs (but alcohol has a higher addicition rate than
most illegal drugs, and tobacco has just about, if not <em>the</em>, highest
addiction rate of all), but that is not typical.</p>

<p>I vehemently reject point 3. Our government has decided that we
<em>shall</em> provide for the less-well-off. I do not believe that the
government is either the best, the most effective, or the lowest cost
provider of welfare. In fact, the more we provide for people who have
made irresponsible lifestyle choices, the easier it becomes for them to
be irresponsible. I have a brother-in-law who was going down that path. He
had both drug and alcohol problems. As long as he had someone in his family to
give him a place to sleep and food to eat, he got worse -- more dependent. At
some point, his mother (the last of the supporters) said, "Enough." It was
painful to her, but it was not that long after that he began to turn his
life around.</p>

<p>Many (if not most) of the crime problems around illegal drugs stem from the
artificially high prices charged for them. There's no reason for cocaine to
cost $100 for a very diluted gram. If people could keep their day job and
afford to buy their substances of choice, you'd have a lot less mugging,
burglary, embezzlement, what have you. In answer to point four, if drugs
were again legal, users could work normal jobs and pay for normal amounts
of drug use. If the lesson of prohibition is any guide, there would be
<em>less</em> drug use.  Drug use would tend to the less-concentrated
forms of the drug, and away from the more dangerous and concentrated
(crack, PCP) drugs that are now being sold to increase the ease of
smuggling and distribution.</p>

<p>We could stop locking up people who engage in peaceful business
transactions and hurt only themselves, if anyone.  We could concentrate
on keeping  those in jail who do commit crimes of force or
fraud against others.  Our jails in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> are so filled
with people
who have committed victimless crimes, thanks to the minimum sentence
laws, that violent criminals serve only one month for each year of
their sentence.</p>

<p>I am very concerned that laws need to focus on responsibility.  If
you choose to take a psychoactive substance, you ought to be responsible
for the acts you do while under its influence.</p>

<p>Someone might say, "When someone is addicted to major personality-altering
drugs, it becomes everyone's problem, since the person on the drugs is
different from the one who calmly debates the need for legalization. I know
of two incidents where train crashes were caused because the conductor was
high. In one, he forgot to switch tracks. He was only high on marijuana, but
many people <em>died</em>. It's no longer just his problem. When someone is
actually addicted, they cannot control themselves, so there are high people
operating heavy equipment, putting lives in danger."</p>

<p>The train incidents argue not for drug prohibition, but for 
competence testing.  Those conductors could just as easily been 
impaired because of lack of sleep or a fight with their wife.  The
dangerous act is operating heavy equipment while impaired, not the
way that one got impaired (unless it should be illegal to not get 
enough sleep?).</p>

<p>Someone who sells bungee jumps is statistically more likely to be
killing someone than I, a computer programmer, is.  Someone who
designed race cars up through the sixties and seventies was 
endangering not only the driver of <em>that</em> car, but also the other
drivers and the spectators; should that have been illegal?  I am
concerned here about the difference between an act of choice
(consumption of a psychoactive substance) and an act of endangerment
(putting others at risk by operating equipment while impaired).
If an act doesn't endanger others, what right have we to make
it a criminal act?</p>

<p>If I can leave you with one thought, let it be this:
I feel strongly that responsibility comes from within -- from 
being able to learn from mistakes.  Our government can give no one
a sense of responsibility (no more than it can give one a sense
of patriotism by drafting them). It has never been a good nanny,
no matter how compelling the cause: a free people must be free to
make mistakes with their own property, money, and bodies.</p>

<title>Christian Group Funds Health Care</title>
<!-- Place: USA;

<h1>Oklahoma Exempts Group From Insurance Regulation</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/">Oklahoma</a> passed
a law, signed by the governor April 28, 1994, exempting
a religious newsletter from insurance regulations, according to a May 2, 1994
report from PRNewswire.</p>

<p>The <cite>Christian Brotherhood Newsletter</cite>, with over 25,000
subscribers nationwide, coordinates contributions
for medical expenses incurred by subscribers. If a member has a need, it is
published in the newsletter, and other subscribers respond with cards, prayers
and monetary gifts to help pay the bills.</p>

<p>The problem is that insurance regulators in Oklahoma and other states see
this as a form of insurance. If the newsletter is forced to comply with
costly insurance regulations, it will go out of business.</p>

<p>Oklahoma State Rep. Jim Dunlap (R) introduced H.B. 2125, exempting
religious organizations from insurance regulation. The bill passed the state
house on a concurrence vote to the state senate version on April 25, and was
signed by the governor April 28.</p>

<p>Similar laws have been passed in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ky/">Kentucky</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ks/">Kansas</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a>.</p>

<p>According to PRNewswire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Oklahoma Insurance Department launched an inquiry into the operation of
the <cite>Newsletter</cite> in June of 1993.  Upon review of documents provided
by the <cite>Newsletter</cite> and a flood of correspondence from Oklahoma
subscribers, Commissioner of Insurance Cathy Weatherford determined in a July
29, 1993 letter to the <cite>Newsletter</cite> that "it appears <cite>Christian
Brotherhood Newsletter</cite> does not meet the definition of insurance found
at 36 O.S. 102."  Ms. Weatherford also suggested at that time to pass
legislation to further clarify the <cite>Newsletter's</cite> status in
Oklahoma.</p>

<p>... House Bill 2125 stipulates that the Oklahoma Insurance Code does not
apply to a non-profit, religious organization that "acts as an organizational
clearinghouse for information between subscribers who have financial,
physical, or medical needs and subscribers who choose to assist with those
needs, matching subscribers with the present ability to pay with subscribers
having a present financial or medical need," as long as the suggested amounts
to give are "voluntary among the subscribers, with no assumption of risk or
promise to pay ..."</p>

<p> In 1993, Newletter subscribers helped each other pay over $27,000,000 of
medical expenses. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The need for such an exemption highlights the fact that regulation drives
up the cost of insurance. If the <cite>Christian Brotherhood Newsletter</cite>
can only operate successfully without regulation, how many private insurance
companies are driven out of the market by such regulation?</p>

<title>Insurance's Proportion of Health Care</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The best-kept secrets in health reform</h1>

<p>Copyright 1994 by <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/MichaelHihn.html">Michael
J. Hihn</a>:</p>

<p>Health care represents 1/7 of our economy, approaching one trillion 
dollars a year.  Of that total, what percent would you say is 
controlled by insurance companies?  In round numbers, 60%, 40%, or 30%?  
Insurance companies are the primary target of health-care reform.  
And, although containing costs is only one goal, we should know how 
much of that goal is being addressed.  What was your answer?</p>

<p>The correct answer is ... less than 15% of national health-care costs 
are paid by private insurers.  And I apologize for the trick question.  
That was for 1990, which you can confirm in the Statistical Abstract 
at your local library.  (I assume you may not believe private insurance 
is so small a factor.)  Insurance companies spent $90 billion of the 
$675 billion total, or 13.3%.</p>

<p>In that same year, government insurance spent nearly twice as much, 
$174 billion, for Medicare/Medicaid alone.  And costs for these 
government plans are increasing nearly twice as fast as private plans.  
That's the first well-kept secret:  government plans dominate the 
health care market, and do the worst at controlling costs.  
But we keep hearing the private sector has failed.  If the auto 
industry is in trouble do we blame the smallest supplier, Chrysler?</p>

<p>In autos as in health care, the largest supplier (GM) is the least 
efficient.  Are Ford and Chrysler customers demanding a takeover by a
less efficient GM?  Or might GM shareholders prefer a takeover by a 
more efficient competitor?  For health care, the evidence suggests 
it's the private sector that should be taking over the government 
plans.  We're doing it backwards.</p>

<p>Here's another well-kept secret:  Three major health-care proposals, 
including the President's, will require higher local taxes for many 
schools and cities.  When I was a school board member at an average-
sized suburban system, we saved tens of thousands of dollars per 
year by self-insuring employee health costs.  We reimbursed expenses 
ourselves, up to a "stop-loss" maximum (high-deductible insurance).  
Self-funding is a proven cost-saver for millions of Americans.  
But the President would make these savings illegal for employers of 
fewer than 1,000.  Do your city and schools self-insure?</p>

<p>In a May 19th <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> op-ed piece, it was reported
that 405,000 small-medium businesses now self-insure their employees.  
Administrative costs average only 6%.  The Independent Grocers 
Association manages a self-funded plan for IGA grocery stores, 
providing coverage for 37,000 families.  But because each store is 
an independent small business, that coverage would be banned.</p>

<p>Self-funding is one way employers have cut costs without sacrificing 
quality.  The other is a major switch to HMO coverage.  From 1980 to 
1992, when insurance rates were skyrocketing, HMO enrollments more 
than quadrupled - from 9.1 million to 37.2 million Americans.  
Both options, self-funding or HMO, provide one-time savings of 30-45% 
from the switch, with future savings from better management.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, employers who provide traditional low-deductible, 
third-party health insurance have failed to control rate increases.  
Instead, those employers shifted more of the burden to workers.</p>

<p>Cost increases are much less in private health plans.  But look 
deeper, and we see two opposing factors.  Traditional plan rates 
are still skyrocketing.  But actual cost <em>reductions</em> are occurring 
in those workplaces, both public and private, that reject or reduce 
traditional coverage.</p>

<p>That's why Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) deserve a closer look.  
MSAs, and how they work, is another well-kept secret.  My family 
already has a restricted MSA, the Flexible Savings Accounts now 
used by millions of Americans.  (Flex accounts are another cost-saver 
the President would repeal.)</p>

<p>Personally, I love a system that eliminates both government and 
insurance bureaucracies.  We have HMO coverage.  Our flex account 
self-reimburses the co-payments (tax free).  We fully self-insure 
(pay cash for) the optical needs of three people, also from the 
tax-free flex account.</p>

<p>Reimbursement is simple, from my wife's employer.  I attach cash 
receipts to a simple form that contains her name, employee number 
and signature.  We get the same tax treatment as employer-paid 
insurance, without paying insurance overhead.  If I could, I'd cancel 
the HMO, buy insurance for only major expenses, pay cash for everything 
else, and let the savings accumulate for our son when we're gone.  
But Congress won't let me.</p>

<p>One proposal, by Senator Phil Gramm, would have your employer place 
your full insurance costs, up to $4,500, into a tax-free MSA.  
It would then be your money.  You could self-insure (pay cash) to 
whatever extent you want, and buy whatever insurance you want ... 
including what you have now.  There's a strong incentive (cash in 
your pocket) to either self-insure or switch to an HMO.  Each year 
you could withdraw up to $1,500 of any savings, as taxable income.</p>

<p>Self-insuring would save the most.  But the Senator may have oversold 
that option, while doing nothing to help you do so.  His critics claim 
most folks are too dumb to shop for insurance.  Are you too dumb?</p>

<p>The critics have a point, though.  If the Senator wants to encourage 
self-insurance (paying cash), he could have made it a lot easier.  
Two simple changes would do that.  First, help more small employers 
to provide self-insured plans, by allowing small-business and trade 
associations to manage them ... like IGA.</p>

<p>For those who want to individually self-insure, Gramm's plan already 
transfers the money to your own account.  Permit banks to offer a 
debit card on MSAs, and we can even eliminate that simple form I 
described.  You'd have two health-care cards.  One for catastrophic 
insurance, which would rarely be used.  Another that automatically 
pays your doctor (or HMO co-pay) from your MSA ... totally eliminating 
their own paperwork.</p>

<p>One card or two?  With one-card plans, we start by repealing proven 
cost-savers, then add a huge new bureaucracy and more insurance 
reimbursements than now.  Add the second card and we slash insurance 
involvement, avoid more government, expand what already works, and give 
you several options to increase your take-home pay.</p>

<p>If we then do likewise with government plans, the savings would pay 
all or most of the costs for universal coverage.  That's the final 
best-kept secret.  The real obstacle to genuine reform is ... partisan 
politics.  It's Democrats who most want universal coverage.  But it's 
Republicans with the best way to pay for it, by cutting costs for the 
currently insured.</p>

healthcare costs, table 162 for Medicaid, table 156 for Medicare,

<title>Medicare</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->

<h1>What we <em>don't</em> need is another Medicare</h1>

<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/MichaelHihn.html">Michael J. Hihn</a></p>

<p>The First Lady has dismissed health care opponents as "the same people 
who opposed Medicare."  But Medicare is lurching toward bankruptcy.  
Its opponents were right.</p>

<p>Let's go back to 1965, when Congress passed Medicare and Medicaid.  
Most of the elderly already had health insurance.  The poor were treated 
at city, county and charity hospitals.  The right to emergency treatment, 
regardless of insurance, had been enacted under Eisenhower.  Medical care 
was available to only slightly fewer people than now.  But medical costs 
were less than half today's level -  5.9% of the economy.</p>

<p>Since 1965, health costs have more than doubled, to 14% of GDP, and are 
projected to triple by the year 2000.  Government now pays over 43% of 
all medical costs - and shifts billions more to private insurers.  From 
a 1991 CBO report:  Medicare  underpays hospital average costs by 
12%.  Medicaid underpays hospitals by 12%, and pays doctors 31% less 
than even Medicare rates.  When government underpays, providers shift 
their costs to private insurers and cash customers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clinton never mentions how Medicare shifts costs to private payers.  
Instead, she points to cost-shifting created by unpaid treatment for the 
poor.  But doctor and hospital bills have <em>always</em> recovered the cost of
unpaid treatment.  What's new is cost shifting by government.</p>

<p>From 1985 to 1989, unpaid hospital care grew slightly, from 5.5% to 6.0% 
of billing.  But government underpayment shot from 0.6% to 5.0% -- the 
same years private insurance premiums started skyrocketing.</p>

<p>Obviously, runaway private insurance costs are not caused by cost shifts 
from the uninsured poor. That shift has always existed, as a bad debt, 
and has remained fairly constant.  Excessive medical cost inflation is 
caused by  new and growing shifts from Medicare and Medicaid.  Politicians 
have promised more than they can pay for with taxes.  So they force private 
insurers to pick up the tab.</p>

<p>Eventually, you and I pay anyhow.  One big difference:  if Medicaid and 
Medicare were fully funded by taxes, we could all see government's failures.  
But shift the costs elsewhere, and private insurance looks like the villain.</p>

<p>CBO also reports that 25% of physicians refuse to see Medicaid patients.  
Other doctors are discouraged by hospitals from admitting Medicaid 
subscribers, thus forcing these patients into hospital emergency rooms.</p>

<p>The first lady claims people use costly emergency rooms because they have 
no insurance.  But under Medicaid, even many <em>insured</em> patients must use
the ER.   Then, because Medicaid refuses to pay emergency room prices, 
the difference is made up by private insurers.</p>

<p>Don't blame hospitals.  The more Medicare and Medicaid patients they 
treat, the more they have to increase prices on everyone else.  Then, 
some consumer group will accuse them of price gouging.  And preferred 
provider plans will decertify them.</p>

<p>The market hasn't failed.  Government health care has failed.  Hospitals 
do compete on price.  But their rewards and incentives are distorted by 
government cost shifts.</p>

<p>So far, we've considered only Medicare's hidden costs.  They also hide 
taxes.  You see some Medicare taxes on your pay sub, as part of the 
FICA deduction.  What you don't see is the hefty subsidy to Medicare 
from general revenues - income taxes.   In 1991, that subsidy was $37.6 
billion  - slightly over 8% of all personal income taxes.  That's up 
sharply too, from 3% in 1980.</p>

<p>There's more.  Take the cost shifting from government health insurance.  
Add the subsidy from income tax revenues.  Then throw in last year's 
Medicare tax hike.  With all that, Medicare will still be broke in 6-8 
years.</p>

<p>In 1965, we should have listened to the critics.  In 1994, we still can.</p>

<p>The Clinton health plan, and even some Republican plans, share the same 
fallacy that's now bankrupting Medicare.  They create a subsidized 
entitlement, for a large group of people, most of whom <em>already have
insurance</em>.  According to Martin Feldstein, former chairman of the 
Council of Economic Advisors, even a modest income-based subsidy would 
create a vast new welfare program for 50 million currently-insured 
Americans.</p>

<p>That's overkill.  And it meets the President's favorite definition of 
insanity ... doing the same thing over and over, but expecting the 
outcome to change.</p>

<title>Forbes Health Insurance Plan</title>

<h1>Forbes' Health Insurance Alternative</h1>

<p>August 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/TFranklinHarrisJr.html">T.
Franklin Harris Jr.</a>, Critic-at-Large, <cite>The Exchange: Culture Reason
Style</cite>:</p>

<p>The Forbes plan gives cash bonuses to employees who do not file health
insurance claims -- that is, to employees to economize, shop 
around, and pay out of pocket for non-catastrophic or routine health care. 
Forbes has saved enough on insurance to more than pay for the bonuses 
they offer. Meanwhile, employees have very high marks for their company's
system.</p>

<title>The British Health Care System</title>
<!-- Place: UK -->
<!-- Time: report 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The British Health Care System</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/MalcolmHutty.html">Malcolm Hutty</a>:</p>

<p>On February 23, 1994 MTHORNTN@business.auburn.edu wrote: "One need not
recount the atrocities of the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> and <A
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canadian</a> health
care systems to know
that shortages of health care services results in poor health and in many cases
unnecessary deaths."</p>

<p>... but since that's where I live, I will. The situation here proves a few 
basic truths. In a world of finite resources, desirable goods and 
services have to be rationed. This can be done by pricing or by 
establishing long queues. If it is done by pricing, desperately urgent cases 
can jump the queue by paying a premium, having a whip-round amongst 
friends or appealing to charity, institutional or personal. If it is done 
by queues, urgent cases simply die.</p>

<p>If the government assumes responsibility for the health of the nation, 
every death is seen as the fault of the government, because "just another 
million" would have endowed a kidney machine and operator. There is an 
unstoppable pressure to increase funding year on year. A slight slowdown in 
the rate of growth of spending is universally denounced in the media as 
"Draconian cuts". Whenever hospitals are moved to suit demographic 
trends, or unsavoury old Victorian hospitals are replaced with new, 
modern hi-tech ones, the TV news does an expose' on "the ward closures" 
and "the secret story of closing hospitals" with ne'er a word of the new 
ones opening. The perpetual message is "spend more, spend now".</p>

<p>When election time comes around patient histories are used as campaign 
fodder. The scandal of Jennifer's ear dominated the 1992 General 
Election, in which the parents of a 4? year old girl used her failure to 
be treated for an ear infection as material for the Labour TV ads,  
damning Conservative "cuts". Spending on the NHS has actually risen 
every year in real terms under the Conservatives since they took office 
in 1979 (and undoubtable, before that too).</p>

<p>If you can afford it you get private health insurance, and private 
treatment when you need it. But because this doesn't relieve you of one 
penny of your liability to pay taxes towards the NHS, a lot of people 
cannot afford it.</p>

<p>Horror stories of incompetent doctors, negligent hospitals and unapproved 
drugs waiting idle for the bureaucrats to give them their blessing do not 
help; I'm sure you have those stories too. But in a country where 
anything short of criminal negligence is acceptable, where gross 
incompetance leads only to transfer to another region, where the doctor 
gets paid according to the number of patients in his area not the amount 
of work he does, you can imagine that while people say "the NHS is the 
greatest part of the Welfare State and the great success of post-war 
socialism", they also say that the system is in crisis, that it cannot go 
on like this.</p>

<title>Canadian Health Care System</title>
<!-- Place: Canada -->

</head>

<body>

<h1>The Canadian Health Care System</h1>

<p>I've lost the author and date of this report on
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada's</a>
national health care system:</p>

<p>In a recent <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite>, a woman described the
horrors of childbirth, without anesthesia -- yet another cutback in Ontario.
Anesthesiologists are becoming rare in the smaller cities, and
now available only during "business hours" even in Toronto.
If you have a baby at night in Toronto -- or in a small town --
be prepared to scream a lot.</p>

<p>The government had announced cancellation of of any epidural
reimbursements in Thunder Bay.</p>

<p>The article did mention that Ontario anethesiologists get only
$100, but failed to observe that this was the likely cause of
the shortage of these <em>specialists</em> in Ontario.</p>

<p>And, it's not just the rich who come to the U.S. for treatment.
Last month's <em>Readers Digest</em> described a retired blue-collar worker
who was forced to sell his house and liquidate his savings, because
he was "too old" to receive a bone marrow transplant in Ontario.</p>

<title>Clinton Immunization Proposal</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: April 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Clinton's Child Immunization Proposal</h1>

<p>THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary<br>
For Immediate Release April 1, 1993<br>
"Comprehensive Child Immunization Act of 1993" FACT SHEET</p>

<p>The President today sent to the Congress the "Comprehensive Child 
Immunization Act of 1993".  This bill is the first legislative 
proposal he has sent to the Congress for consideration and 
enactment.  When enacted, the bill will assure that all children 
in the United States are protected against vaccine-preventable 
infectious diseases by their second birthday.  This legislation 
inaugurates a new collaborative partnership among parents and 
guardians; health care providers; vaccine manufacturers; and 
Federal, State, and local governments to protect our children 
from the deadly onslaught of infectious diseases.</p>

<p>This legislation would:</P>
<ul>
<li><p>beginning in fiscal year 1995, authorize the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services to purchase and provide childhood 
vaccines in quantities sufficient to meet the immunization 
needs of children in the United States;</p>

<li><p>establish a national immunization tracking system, through 
grants to the States to establish State immunization 
registries, to ensure that children receive their scheduled 
immunizations at the earliest appropriate age; </p>

<li><p>ensure that the National Vaccine Injury Compensation 
Program, an essential link in our Nation's immunization 
system, remains operational; and</p>

<li><p>continue vaccine infrastructure enhancements started in my 
economic stimulus program.</p>

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Immunizations represent one of the most cost-effective means of 
disease prevention.  Although Federal support for childhood 
immunization has been in existence since 1962, the full potential 
of immunizations remains to be achieved.  </p>

<p> Approximately 80 percent of vaccine doses should be received 
before the second birthday in order to protect children during 
their most vulnerable periods.  Unfortunately, many children do 
not receive their basic immunizations by that time.  In fact, in 
some inner city areas as few as 10 percent of 2-year olds have 
received a complete series.  This low level of immunizations has 
been reflected in recent years in outbreaks of measles among un-immunized
preschool children.  The resurgence of measles in 1989 
through 1991 afflicted over 55,000 people and cost the country 
$20 million in avoidable hospital costs alone.</p>

<p> In 1982, the recommended vaccine schedule cost $6.69 in the 
public sector and $23.29 in the private sector.  By 1992, the 
total cost for fully immunizing a child was $122.28 in the public 
sector and $244.10 in the private sector.  </p>

<hr>

<h2>Legislative Proposal</h2>

<p>The problem posed by soaring vaccine costs is exacerbated by a 
deteriorated immunization infrastructure.  This legislation 
continues the rebuilding of our capacity to deliver vaccines and 
educate parents started in my economic stimulus package.  With 
this bill, our Nation's vaccine infrastructure will continue to 
be revitalized, including delivery, safety and research capacity, 
patient and vaccine tracking ability, and the community-based 
outreach and information campaign.</p>

<p> To remove the financial barriers to immunization that impede 
children from being vaccinated on time, and to facilitate 
development of a national tracking system, we must begin Federal 
purchase of all vaccines recommended for universal use in children.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Universal Vaccine Purchase and Provision</h2>

<p> The bill would require that the Secretary consult with other 
Federal agencies for advice on the quantities of recommended 
childhood vaccine to be purchased.  It would authorize the 
Secretary to consult with representatives of State governments, 
experts in vaccine delivery, health care providers, and other 
experts prior to commencing negotiations for the purchase of vaccine.  </p>

<p> This proposal would direct the Secretary to negotiate a 
reasonable price with manufacturers participating in a 
procurement.  The price would be based on data supplied to the 
Secretary by manufacturers regarding (1) costs related to 
research and development, production, distribution to States and 
health care providers, and marketing; (2) profit levels 
sufficient to encourage future investment in research and 
development; and (3) the ability to maintain adequate outbreak 
control.  In addition, the bill would require that data provided 
to the Secretary be treated as a trade secret or confidential 
information for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act and 
would provide criminal sanctions for violations of this provision.</p>

<p> Under this legislation, the Secretary would provide (either 
directly or through the States) for the free distribution of 
vaccines to health care providers who serve children and are 
located in a State that participates in the State registry grant 
program.  In non-participating States, free vaccine will be 
distributed to Federal health care providers, community health 
centers, migrant health centers, health centers serving residents 
of public housing or the homeless, other federally qualified 
health centers, and health care providers serving Indians 
pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination Act or section 503 of 
the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.</p>

<p> Under the Act, health care providers could not charge patients 
for the cost of the vaccine, but may impose a fee for its 
administration unless such a fee would result in the denial of a 
vaccine to someone unable to pay.</p>

<p> Finally, the bill provides that the authority of the Secretary 
established under this legislation to purchase and provide 
vaccines shall cease to be in effect beginning on such date as 
may be specified in a Federal law providing for immunization 
services for all children as part of a broad-based reform of the 
national health care system.</p>

<hr>

<h2>State Immunization Registries</h2>

<p> The bill provides for a collaborative Federal and State effort to 
track the immunization status of the Nation's children.  It 
authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States to establish 
and operate State immunization registries containing specific 
information for each child in the State.  Entering infant birth 
data into registries will enable the identification of children 
who need vaccinations and will help parents and providers assure 
that children are appropriately immunized.  </p>

<p> Providers would be required to report to the State tracking 
registry (or to the Secretary if there is no State registry) 
information regarding each vaccine administered and their 
periodic estimates of the future vaccine needs.  For each child, 
information will be gathered on immunization history, including 
types and lot numbers of vaccines received, health care provider 
identifiers, and adverse reactions associated with the 
immunizations.  In addition, the State immunization registries 
will provide vital information on safety and efficacy of vaccines 
by linking administrative records with adverse reactions 
reporting and disease outbreak patterns.  </p>

<hr>

<h2>The National Vaccine Compensation Program</h2>

<p> A keystone to the Nation's vaccine immunization effort is the 
National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.  This proposal 
would amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow payments from the 
Trust Fund for compensable injuries from vaccines administered on 
or after October 1, 1992.  It would authorize appropriations from 
the Trust Fund for years after fiscal year 1992 for 
administrative costs to carry out the National Vaccine Injury 
Compensation Program.  In addition, it would provide for a 
permanent extension and reinstatement of the vaccine excise tax 
and repeal the Internal Revenue Code provision that authorizes 
the Secretary of the Treasury to terminate the vaccine excise tax.</p>

<p> Other provisions related to the National Vaccine Injury 
Compensation program state that any vaccine recommended for 
universal administration to children by the Secretary would be 
included on the Vaccine Injury Table.  The bill would provide the 
Secretary authority, with respect to any vaccine so added, to 
modify the Table, but only in accordance with notice, hearing, 
and comment procedures, and other limitations.  The chief special 
master would be allowed to suspend proceedings on petitions from 
retrospective claims for up to 30 months, rather than the 540 
days (or 18 months) in current law.  </p>

<p> Finally, vaccine information materials would be simplified by 
replacing the detailed list of items that must be addressed in 
the information materials with a requirement for a concise and 
understandable statement of the benefits and risks of the 
vaccine, and the availability of the National Vaccine Injury 
Compensation Program.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p> For the purpose of making State registry grants, the bill would 
authorize appropriations of $152 million for fiscal year 1995, 
$125 million for fiscal year 1996, and $35 million for each of 
the fiscal years 1997, 1998, and 1999.  In addition, the bill 
would authorize appropriations of such sums as may be necessary 
for fiscal years 1993 and 1994 for start up costs associated with 
activities to implement the "Comprehensive Child Immunization Act 
of 1993."  </p>

<p> Beginning in fiscal year 1995, the bill would authorize the 
Secretary to carry out the program of vaccine purchase and 
distribution from the Comprehensive Child Immunization Account in 
the United States Treasury.  The sources of revenue that will be 
deposited into the Comprehensive Child Immunization Account for 
the vaccine purchase and distribution program will be identified 
in legislation for broad-based reform of the national health care 
system when it is submitted to the Congress by the President in May.</p>

<h1>Criticism of Clinton's Health Care Plan</h1>

<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/MurrayRothbard.html">Murray N.
Rothbard</a></p>

<p>The standard media cliche about the Clinton health plan is that God, or the
Devil, depending on your point of view, "is in the details." There is
surprising agreement among both the supporters and all too many of the
critics of the Clinton health "reform." The supporters say that the general
principles of the plan are wonderful, but that there are a few problems in
the details: e.g., how much will it cost, how exactly will it be financed,
will small business get a sufficient subsidy to offset its higher costs, and
on into the night.</p>

<p>The alleged critics of the Clinton Plan also hasten to assure us that they
too accept the general principles, but that there are lots of problems in the
details. Often the critics will present their own alternative plans, only
slightly less complex than the Clinton scheme, accompanied by assertions that
their plans are less coercive, less costly, and less socialistic than the
Clinton effort. And since health care constitutes about one-seventh of the
American output, there are enough details and variants to keep a host of
policy wonks going for the rest of the their lives. </p>

<p> But the details of the Clintonian plan, however diabolic, are merely petty
demons compared to the general principles, where Lucifer really lurks. By
accepting the principles, and fighting over the details, the Loyal Opposition
only succeeds in giving away the store, and doing so before the debate over
the details can even get under way. Lost in an eye-glazing thicket of
minutiae, the conservative critics of Clintonian reform, by being
"responsible" and working within the paradigm set by The Enemy, are
performing a vital service for the Clintonians in snuffing out any clear-cut
opposition to Clinton's Great Leap Forward into health collectivism. </p>

<p> Let us examine some of the Mephistophelean general principles in the
Clintonian reform, seconded by the conservative critics.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Guaranteed universal access. There has been a lot of talk recently about
"universal access" to this or that good or service. Many "libertarian" or
"free-market" proponents of education "reform," for example, advocate
tax-supported voucher schemes to provide "access" to private schooling. But
there is one simple entity, in any sort of free society, that provides
"universal access" to every conceivable good or service, and not just to
health or education or food. That entity is not a voucher or a Clintonian ID
card; it's called a "dollar." Dollars not only provide universal access to
all goods and services, they provide it to each dollar-holder for each
product only to the extent that the dollar-holder desires. Every other
artificial accessor, be it voucher or health card or food stamp, is despotic
and coercive, mulcts the taxpayer, is inefficient and egalitarian.</p>

<li><p>Coercive. "Guaranteed universal access" can only be provided by the
robbery of taxation, and the essence of this extortion is not changed by
calling these taxes "fees," "premiums," or "contributions." A tax by any
other named smells as rotten, and has similar consequences, even if only
"employers" are forced to pay the higher "premiums."</p>

<p> Furthermore, for anyone to be "guaranteed" access to anything, he has to be
forced to participate, both in receiving its "benefits" and in paying for
them. Hence, "guaranteed universal access" means coercing not only taxpayers,
but everyone as participants and contributors. All the weeping and wailing
about the 37 million "uninsured" glosses over the fact that most of these
uninsured have a made a rational decision that they don't want to be
"insured," that they are willing to take the chance of paying market prices
should health care become necessary. But they will not be permitted to remain
free of the "benefits" of insurance; their participation will become
compulsory. We will all become health draftees. </p>

<li><p>Egalitarian. Universal means egalitarian. For the dread egalitarian theme
of "fairness" enters immediately into the equation. Once government becomes
the boss of all health, under the Clinton plan or the Loyal Opposition, then
it seems "unfair" for the rich to enjoy better medical care than the lowest
bum. This "fairness" ploy is considered self-evident and never subject to
criticism. Why is "the two-tier" health system (actually it has been
multi-tier) any more "unfair" than the multi-tier system for clothing or food
or transportation? So far at least, most people don't consider it unfair that
some people can afford to dine at The Four Seasons and vacation at Martha's
Vineyard, whereas others have to rest content with McDonald's and staying
home. Why is medical care any different? </p>

<p> And yet, one of the major thrusts of the Clinton Plan is to reduce us all to
"one-tier," egalitarian health care status.</p>

<li><p>Collectivist. To insure equality for one and all, medical care will be
collectivist, under close supervision of the federal Health Care Board, with
health provision and insurance dragooned by government into regional
collectives and alliances. The private practice of medicine will be
essentially driven out, so that these collectives and HMOs will be the only
option for the consumer. Even though the Clintonians try to assure Americans
that they can still "choose their own doctor," in practice this will be
increasingly impossible. </p>

<li><p>Price Controls. Since it is fairly well known that price controls have
never worked, that they have always been a disaster, the Clinton
Administration always keen on semantic trickery, have stoutly denied that any
price controls are contemplated. But the network of severe price controls
will be all too evident and painful, even if they wear the mask of "premium
caps," "cost caps," or "spending control." They will have to be there, for it
is the promise of "cost control" that permits the Clintonians to make the
outrageous claim that taxes will hardly go up at all. (Except, of course, on
employers.)  Tight spending control will be enforced by the government,
not merely on its own, but particularly on private spending. </p>

<p> One of the most chilling aspects of the Clinton plan is that any attempt by
us consumers to get around these price controls, e.g. to pay higher than
controlled prices to doctors in private practice, will be criminalized. Thus,
the Clinton Plan states that "A provider may not charge or collect from the
patient a fee in excess of the fee schedule adopted by an alliance," and
criminal penalties will be imposed for "payment of bribes or gratuities"
(i.e. "black market prices") to "influence the delivery of health service." </p>

<p> In arguing for their plan, by the way, the Clintonians have added insult to
injury by employing absurd nonsense in the form of argument. Their main
argument for the plan is that health care is "too costly," and that thesis
rests on the fact that health care spending, over recent years, has risen
considerably as a percentage of the GDP. But a spending rise is scarcely the
same as a cost increase; if it were, then I could easily argue that, since
the percentage of GDP spent on computers has risen wildly in the past ten
years, that "computer costs" are therefore excessive, and severe price
controls, caps, and spending controls must be imposed promptly on consumer
and business purchases of computers. </p>

<li><p>Medical Rationing. Severe price and spending controls means, of course,
that medical care will have to be strictly rationed, especially since these
controls and caps come at the same time that universal and equal care is
being "guaranteed." Socialists, indeed, always love rationing, since it gives
the bureaucrats power over the people and makes for coercive egalitarianism.</p>

<p> And so this means that the government, and its medical bureaucrats and
underlings, will decide who gets what service. Medical totalitarianism, if
not the rest of us, will be alive and well in America.</p>

<li><p>The Annoying Consumer. We have to remember a crucial point about
government as against business operations on the market. Businesses are
always eager for consumers to buy their product or service. On the free
market, the consumer is king or queen and the "providers" are always trying
to make profits and gain customers by serving them well. But when government
operates a service, the consumer is transmuted into a pain-in-the-neck, a
"wasteful" user-up of scarce social resources. Whereas the free market is a
peaceful cooperative place where everyone benefits and no one loses, when
government supplies the product or service, every consumer is treated as
using a resource only at the expense of his fellow-men. The "public service"
arena, and not the free market, is the dog-eat-dog jungle. </p>

<p> So there we have the Clintonian health future: government as totalitarian
rationer of health care, grudgingly doling out care on the lowest possible
level equally to all, and treating each "client" as a wasteful pest. And
if, God forbid, you have a serious health problem, or are elderly, or your
treatment requires more scarce resources than the Health Care Board deems
proper, well then Big Brother or Big Sister Rationer in Washington will
decided, in the best interests of "society," of course, to give you the
Kevorkian treatment. </p>

<li><p>The Great Leap Forward. There are many other ludicrous though almost
universally accepted aspects of the Clinton Plan, from the gross perversion
of the concept of "insurance" to the imbecilic view that an enormous
expansion of government control will somehow eliminate the need for filling
out health forms. But suffice it to stress the most vital point: the plan
consists of one more Great Leap Forward into collectivism.</p>

<p> The point was put very well, albeit admiringly, by David Lauter in the Los
Angeles Times (September 23). Every once in a while, said Lauter, "the
government collectively braces itself, takes a deep breath and leaps into a
largely unknown future." The first American leap was the New Deal in the
1930s, leaping into Social Security and extensive federal regulation of the
economy. The second leap was the civil rights revolution of the 1960s. And
now, writes Lauter, "another new President has proposed a sweeping plan" and
we have been hearing again "the noises of a political system warming up once
again for the big jump."</p>

<p> The only important point Mr. Lauter omits is leaping into what? Wittingly or
unwittingly, his "leap" metaphor rings true, for it recalls the Great Leap
Forward of Mao's worst surge into extreme Communism.</p>

<p> The Clinton health plan is not "reform" and it doesn't meet a "crisis." Cut
through the fake semantics, and what we have is another Great Leap Forward
into socialism. While
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russia</a> and the former
Communist states are struggling
to get out of socialism and the disaster of their "guaranteed universal
health care" (check their vital statistics), Clinton and his bizarre Brain
Trust of aging leftist grad students are proposing to wreck our economy, our
freedom, and what has been, for all of the ills imposed by previous
government intervention, the best medical system on earth. </p>

</ol>

<p>That is why the Clinton health plan must be fought against root and branch,
why Satan is in the general principles, and why the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/L/Mises.html">Ludwig von Mises
Institute</a>, instead of offering its own 500-page health plan, sticks to its
principled "four-step" plan laid out by Mises Institute Senior Fellow
Hans-Hermann Hoppe (<cite>The Free Market</cite> April 1993) of dismantling
existing government intervention into health. </p>

<title>Health Supplements</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Health Supplements</h1>

<p>Open Letter to the President</p>

<p>Dear President Clinton:</p>

<p>I urge you to actively support and lobby Congress to pass The
Supplement Health and Education Act of 1993. which provides necessary
definitions and direction for the FDA, introduced as bicameral, bipartisan
legislation by by Congressman Bill Richardson (H.R. 1709) and Senator Orrin
Hatch (S.784). Under the Bush Administration the FDA substantially expanded
its scope of operation by misapplying the thirty-five year old amendment to
the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) passed by Congress to regulate and
ensure the safety of new chemical additives which were entering the market,
to substances which have been traditionally recognized as food or food
supplements.  I believe that the FDA's action warrants specific direction by
Congress. Please lobby Congress to see that these bills are passed.</p>

<p>For example, the FDA seized two barrels of black currant oil (BCO), claiming
it was a food additive because it had been placed in gelatin capsules.
U.S. District Court for the Central District of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a> denied the
FDA's attempt to dispose of the case without trial on April 10, 1991,
and found in favor of Traco Labs, on the grounds that the FDA had failed
to make its case, and stated that simply adding BCO to gelatin capsules
did not make BCO a food additive.  In November the court dismissed the
FDA's case because the FDA had nothing further to add to its position.</p>

<p>The FDA appealed the decision on October 21, 1992 to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.  In its judgment, rendered
January 27, 1993, the appeals court affirmed the lower court decision
and found in favor of Traco.  Writing for the court, Judge Cudahy stated
that "the Act (FDCA) distinguishes between food additives and food in the
generic sense, this distinction being critical ... The FDA's food additive
definition is so broad, however, that it would blur this distinction.
It would classify every component of food -- even single active
ingredients -- as food additives.  Thus, it would seem, even the addition
of water to food would make the food a food additive.  The only
justification for this Alice-in-Wonderland approach is to allow the
FDA to make an end-run around the statutory scheme..."</p>

<p>The court decision stated:  "The FDA's interpretation would also
arbitrarily classify a substance as either a food or a food additive by
how it is marketed rather than by the nature and use of the substance
itself. The FDA concedes that BCO marketed in bottles instead of capsule
form is not a food additive...  How a product is marketed is not a rational
way of determining whether a substance is a food additive."</p>

<p>An identical case was won in the First Circuit Court of Appeals on
March 3, 1993.  Leslie Kux, the FDA's Associate Chief Counsel for
Enforcement declined comment saying, "the Black Currant Oil cases are
still in litigation.  Suffice it to say that we believe that our legal
position is a sound one."</p>

<p>Even as a layman, it would seem that this legal position is ridiculous.
The FDA regulations, do, as Judge Cudahy suggested, treat herbal teas
as food additives arguing that the addition of an herb to hot water
constitutes food additive status for that herb, while at the same time
regulating true food additives that may be mixed into that herb.  It
should be obvious that the FDA needs further direction from Congress
in determining what a food additive is and what constitutes nutritional
substances.</p>

<p>I believe that the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1993,
is necessary, if for no other reason than to stop the FDA from wasting
valuable tax funds when it has more immediate budget concerns in meeting
its primary function of quality and safety assurance.  I also believe
that an investigation of the FDA's reasons for pursuing such ridiculous
cases in an already over-burdened court system is called for by Congress.
I strongly urge you to support the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act of 1993.</p>

<title>FDA Limits Medical Devices</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: report August 1994 -->

<h1>The Food and Drug Administration</h1>

<p>"FEEL A HEART ATTACK COMING? GO TO FRANCE" by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/V/AlexanderVolokh.html">Alexander Volokh</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/C/CEI.html">CEI</a>
policy analyst; appeared in the August 2, 1994 <cite>The Wall Street
Journal</cite>:</p>

<p>Imagine that you've had a heart attack.  Amid the wails of sirens and
the flash of red lights, paramedics are rushing to help you.  Skilled in
the art of CPR, they remove your shirt and prepare to revive you.  But
much to their surprise -- and yours -- a sign about your neck reads, "Do
not resuscitate." </p>

<p> The real shocker is that, unbeknownst to you, this sign was placed
there by the Food and Drug Administration.  In April 1993, the FDA blocked
testing of the cardiopump, a new cardiopulmonary resuscitation device for
heart-attack victims.  As a result of FDA policy, thousands of people with
heart disease are literally being protected to death. </p>

<p> The cardiopump, manufactured by Ambu International of Denmark, is a
modest device.  It weighs a mere pound and a half and looks like a
modified toilet plunger, with a pliable cup that fits onto the
heart-attack victim's chest and a combination hand- grip/pressure gauge
instead of the wooden handle.  Manual CPR exerts downward pressure on the
chest, but the chest has to re- expand naturally.  The cardiopump can
apply pressure in both directions.  Says Dr. Jeffrey Shultz of the
University of Minnesota: "It turns the chest into a bellows.  It allows
you to pull blood back into the heart and air back into the lungs." </p>

<p> Just how effective is the cardiopump?  In St. Paul, Minn., where
tests were carried out, 54% more patients survived long enough to be
admitted to intensive care if they were given cardiopump-assisted CPR, and
35% more survived to be discharged from the hospital.  (Because of small
sample size, the hospital discharge statistics aren't statistically
significant.)</p>

<p> U.S. tests for the cardiopump began in 1992 and continued until April
1993, when FDA barred further use of the pumps.  According to FDA
spokeswoman Sharon Snider, "This product is considered to be a
'significant risk device,' and informed consent is required for any trials
of significant risk devices." </p>

<p> The FDA's view is shared by virtually no one.  None of the
institutional review boards at the 12 medical institutions where the tests
had been carried out called the cardiopump a "significant risk device." 
More important, the cardiopump is already in use around the world --
Austria and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/France/">France</a> (where it is standard
in physician-manned ambulances), England, Germany, Sweden, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada</a>, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Oceania/Australia/">Australia</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a> and Chile, among
others.  The FDA, in its treatment of the pump, stands alone. </p>

<p> The concepts of "significant risk" and "informed consent" may well be
important, but their relevance here is highly questionable.  "Significant
risk" is meaningless unless you compare the risk of the device with the
risk of <em>not</em> using it.  The survival statistics of manual CPR are
dismal. About one million people have cardiac arrests every year in the U.S.,
and an estimated 700,000 are given CPR.  About 680,000 of these 700,000 do not
survive to leave the hospital.  If the FDA had jurisdiction over manual
CPR, it might well prohibit it on the same grounds. </p>

<p> As for informed consent, keep in mind that these are patients whose
hearts have literally stopped beating.  "You're talking about a
life-or-death situation where our current therapy is nearly hopeless,"
explains Dr. Joseph P. Ornato, chairman of the American Heart
Association's emergency cardiac care committee.  "The reality is, there is
no reasonable means to get informed consent." </p>

<p> The issue of informed consent for unconscious patients may be a
complex question in some cases.  This, however, is not one of them.  The
cardiopump is hardly experimental.  In France, the average approval time
for a medical device is a year and a half; the cardiopump was approved in
March 1993 after just nine weeks.  But the FDA has been of little help,
aside from vaguely offering to "work with the company" in devising
acceptable test procedures.  It will take years just to produce studies
with enough "informed consent" patients to satisfy the FDA. </p>

<p> The world-wide medical community is somewhat nonplussed by the U.S.
government's attitude toward medical technology.  The feeling is
widespread that the Americans are shooting themselves in the foot by
making it so difficult for new drugs and devices to reach the market.  As
Dr. William Grace of St. Vincent's Hospital in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a> put it: "We are a
Third World nation when it comes to the development of ... drugs for people
with life-threatening diseases." </p>

<p> Keith Lurie, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota
who helped develop the cardiopump, estimates that the device will increase
one's chances of survival by about 10-50%.  That kind of improvement "has
not been reported since the first description of manual CPR more than
three decades ago."  Since 20,000 CPR patients a year survive to leave the
hospital, even a 10% increase would mean 2,000 extra lives saved.  In the
St. Paul trial, the increase was 35%, which extrapolates nationally to
7,000 lives, or roughly 20 a day. </p>

<p> Yet strange as the FDA's actions might seem from a medical
standpoint, they are perfectly understandable politically.  If the FDA
mistakenly approves a device that has adverse side effects, this would
result in highly undesirable publicity.  On the other hand, if the FDA
delays in approving a life-saving device, the people who die are
politically invisible.  For a regulator, it's easy to err on the side of
overcaution, even when the results are deadly. </p>

<p> The irony is that we applaud FDA approvals when we should really be
asking why we had to wait so long.  In 1987, when FDA approved
streptokinase, the first drug that could be intravenously administered to
reopen the blocked coronary arteries of heart-attack victims, it was
estimated that the drug could have saved 22,000 lives in the two years
between the filing of the new drug application and the approval.  But
these deaths received less media attention than the deaths of five
patients last year during a test of the hepatitis B vaccine fialuridine. </p>

<p> Now Congress is considering charging device manufacturers "user fees"
of up to $50,000 per new-product application; FDA Commissioner David
Kessler calls this the solution to FDA's backlog problem.  But backlog
isn't the problem.  No amount of staff and funding increases can erase the
bureaucratic incentive to impose restrictions as illogical as informed
consent from patients with no pulse. </p>

<title>Libertarian Project Healthy Choice</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Project Healthy Choice</h1>

<p>Project Healthy Choice is the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party's</a> alternative
free market health care proposal.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#clinton">The Clinton Plan</a>
<li><a href="#libertarian">The Libertarian Alternative</a>
<li><a href="#summary">Summary</a>
</ul>

<h2><a name=clinton>The Clinton Plan</a></h2>

<p>At the heart of President Clinton's proposals for health
care reform is a concept known as "managed competition."
The concept is the brain child of the "Jackson
Hole Group," an ad hoc coalition of health care executives and
academic specialists, led by Dr. Paul Elwood <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p> As envisioned under the President's proposals, each state would
establish one or more Health Alliances, which would act as
collective purchasing agents on behalf of employers and individuals <a
href="#fn2">[2]</a>.
All Americans would be enrolled in a Health Alliance, either
through their employer or individually <a href="#fn3">[3]</a>.  The Alliance
would negotiate with certified health Plans for a benefits package on
behalf of its members, operating much like German sickness
funds <a href="#fn4">[4]</a>.  The government would establish a Guaranteed
National Benefits Package, effectively determining what benefits will and
will not be included in any policies offered. Ultimately, individuals
would be able to choose from three government-defined insurance plans.
The lowest cost of these would be a managed care
plan. Traditional fee-for-service plans, which allow a full choice
of physicians, may be available, but would be much higher priced.
Certified health plans partnerships would be required to community
rate all members of the Alliance and to guarantee coverage
to all Alliance members. Every American will receive a "health
security card" as a symbol of his now guaranteed health coverage <a
href="#fn5">[5]</a>.</p>

<p> Employers would be required to provide coverage for all employees,
both full-time and part-time. Employers must pay at least
80% of the cost of coverage, with the employee paying 20%. The
employer's premium payment would be capped at 7.9% of an
employee's wages for most businesses. However, some very
small businesses could have their premiums capped at 3.9% of
wages. Nonemployed people with incomes and the self-employed
would also have to pay a tax. The federal government
would subsidize insurance purchases by those not covered
through an employer and unable to pay the full insurance cost
themselves <a href="#fn6">[6]</a>.</p>

<p> Public programs, such as Medicaid, would have the option of
purchasing care through an Alliance <a href="#fn7">[7]</a>.</p>

<p> A global budget would be established and premium caps would
be imposed on the certified health plans, in the hopes of using
them to indirectly impose price restraints on hospitals and
physicians.</p>

<p> The program would be overseen by a new federal agency, The
National Health Board. This would be an independent agency,
"similar to the SEC," removed from day-to-day oversight by
Congress or the Executive Branch, with broad powers, including
"stand-by" authority to impose more direct price controls.</p>

<p> However, as legal economist Richard Epstein has noted, "[Managed
Competition] is not so much a coherent government plan
as an oxymoron. It is possible to have either managed health care
or to have open competition in health care services. It is not
possible to have both simultaneously."<a href="#fn8">[8]</a> As proposed,
managed competition appears to offer a great deal of management and
very little competition. Often discussed as a compromise between
various health care reform proposals, managed competition
borrows many of the worst elements of other proposals.</p>

<p> As Alain Enthoven, one of the leading proponents of managed
competition admits, it is not "a free market system." <a href="#fn9">[9]</a> He
is certainly correct about that.</p>

<p> First, the mandate that employers provide health benefits for all
full-time employees will cost jobs. The Jackson Hole Group
admits that "employer mandates are a form of employment
tax."<a href="#fn10">[10]</a>  They claim, however, that their explicit taxes
would be "fairer" than the current system of allocating costs. But, the real
result of such a tax increase is likely to be lost jobs.</p>

<p> The amount of compensation each worker receives for his or her
work is directly related to that worker's productivity. Mandating
an increase in that compensation by requiring the employer to
provide health insurance does nothing to increase productivity.
Thus one of two things happens: either 1) consumers must pay
higher prices for products; or 2) more likely in a competitive
economy, employers will be forced to reduce their payroll costs
to offset these new and increased costs of health benefits. Payroll
reductions may take several forms. One is a reduction in cash
compensation, which in practice is unlikely. More probable is a
reduction in the number of employees, either through layoffs or
by postponing the hiring of new workers.  In either case,
unemployment increases, especially among low-skilled workers
for whom mandated health benefits constitutes a relatively large
increase in employee compensation <a href="#fn11">[11]</a>.</p>

<p> The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), which
represents more than 500,000 small businesses in all 50 states,
surveyed its members and found that 23% would be forced to lay-off
employees if an employer mandate imposed an additional
cost of only $100 per employee per month. Nearly 22%
indicated that they could be forced out of business altogether <a
href="#fn12">[12]</a>.</p>

<p> Indeed, a March 1992 study by the Joint Economic Committee
of Congress estimated that more than 1.2 million jobs would be
lost within one year of enactment of federally mandated health
insurance. Other economists have placed the estimate of jobs lost
at between 630,000 and 3.5 million <a href="#fn13">[13]</a>.</p>

<p> There is a particular unfairness to such a mandate. While most
individuals without health insurance are the working poor,
studies show that 25% of the uninsured have incomes greater
than 300% of the poverty level <a href="#fn14">[14]</a>. These are frequently
young, healthy individuals who have chosen not to purchase health
insurance, preferring to spend their discretionary income elsewhere.
Under an employer mandate, low-skilled, poor people
would lose their jobs to provide these relatively affluent individuals
with government-funded health insurance.</p>

<p> Second, the proposal creates a huge new bureaucracy, the
National Health Board, as well as mini-bureaucracies at the state
level in the Health Alliances. While the proposal fails to offer any
real estimate of the cost of these agencies, those costs can be
assumed to be substantial.</p>

<p> Third, the call for a guaranteed National Benefits Package simply
moves the problems of mandated insurance benefits from the
states to the federal level. Inclusion in the mandated benefits
package is much more likely to be based on the relative lobbying
strength of various provider groups than on a rational view of
medical necessity.  Already the scramble is beginning with women's
groups demanding coverage for abortion and more frequent
mammograms,<a href="#fn15">[15]</a> disputes over the extent of mental health
coverage, etc. <a href="#fn16">[16]</a> Whatever benefits are mandated will
increase the cost of insurance.  And, consumers will be deprived of the ability
to make individual choices on the type of benefits they wish to purchase.</p>

<p> Fourth, requirements for guaranteed issue and community rating
will increase the cost of insurance. Insurance is a business of risk
allocation, in which the insurer receives payment in exchange for
agreeing to cover the expense of certain risks. The cost and
scope of coverage is determined by morbidity/mortality statistical
analysis <a href="#fn17">[17]</a>.  To the degree that insurers are prevented
from basing their contracts on such actuarial values, other policyholders
will be forced to absorb the additional costs.</p>

<p> The whole theory underlying community rating is essentially a
flawed one that healthy people and sick people should pay the
same for insurance. Since sick people inevitably require greater
benefits, the cost of insuring them must be subsidized by healthy
people. Thus, in order to provide coverage for a person with
AIDS, a person without AIDS must pay a higher premium.
Moreover, the additional costs are highly regressive in nature,
forcing the highest marginal costs on those least able to afford the
increase. For example, if community rating causes the premiums
for a famity policy to increase by $1,000, that's a 10% surcharge
for a family earning only $10,000 per year, but only a 1%
surcharge for a family earning $100,000 <a href="#fn18">[18]</a>.  The
subsidization is also regressive because those low-risk persons, who will see
their premiums increase, tend to be young with lower incomes, while
high-risk persons, who will be subsidized, tend to be older and
have higher incomes.</p>

<p> Finally, we should recognize that community rating relieves
individuals of the responsibility for unhealthy lifestyles. There is
no question that individuals who smoke, drink, use drugs,
practice unsafe sex, have poor diets and fail to exercise have far
higher health costs than individuals with healthy lifestyles. In fact,
the top ten causes of death in the United States are all lifestyle
related <a href="#fn19">[19]</a>.  But, by spreading the cost over the entire
population, community rating and guaranteed issue "socialize" the costs in
the truest sense of the word.</p>

<p> Perhaps nothing better illustrates the failures of community
rating than recent events in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a>. On April
1, 1993, New
York began to enforce the nation's most stringent community
rating and guaranteed issue requirements <a href="#fn20">[20]</a>. The result
has been astronomical increases in insurance premiums, in some cases
doubling and tripling rates. The average premium for a 30 year-old
male will increase from $1,200 per year to $3,240, a 170
percent hike. A family policy for a 30 year-old will jump 91
percent, from $4,020 to $7,680, well beyond the reach of most
lower- and middle-income families. Of course some will benefit
under New York's plan. The elderly will see a reduction in their
premiums of nearly 50 percent <a href="#fn21">[21]</a>.</p>

<p> Fifth, the Clinton plan will severely limit consumer choice --
choice of insurer, choice of benefits, and choice of physician.
Numerous studies have shown that Americans do not like
restrictive managed care plans that limit their choice of physicians <a
href="#fn22">[22]</a>.
Because the cap on premiums, community rating and
other restrictions in the President's plan generally prevents
insurers from competing on the basis of their ability to price and
manage risk, most traditional insurers would be driven out of the
market. The criteria established for certified health Plans essentially
limits the market to "the Blues" -- Blue Cross and Blue
Shield -- and a handful of large HMO's <a href="#fn23">[23]</a>.  Thus, the
support for the Clinton health plan by these insurers.</p>

<p> The Clinton plan also holds the potential of severely disrupting the
traditional doctor-patient relationship. Managed competition
changes insurers from "financial intermediaries with expertise in
underwriting risks" to "health care delivery systems ... organizing,
managing and purchasing medical care." <a href="#fn24">[24]</a>  In short,
advocates of managed competition believe physicians should be responsible to
insurers, rather than the patient. This means that patient choice of
physician should be limited to give the insurer increased bargaining
power with the doctor. It also means increasing insurer
control over the physicians choice of treatment, so that insurers
can "apply quality assurance or review of appropriateness." <a
href="#fn25">[25]</a></p>

<p> As Swiss medical philosopher Ernest Truffer has noted, the
increasing interjection of third-parties between doctor and
patient "amounts to a rejection of the medical ethic -- which is
to care for a patient according to the latter's specific (medical)
requirements -- in favor of a veterinary ethic, which consists in
caring for the sick animal not in accordance with its specific
medical needs, but according to the requirements of its master
and owner, the person responsible for meeting any costs
incurred." <a href="#fn26">[26]</a></p>

<p> Finally, the proposal is vague about how it will control overall
health costs. Advocates of managed competition have a tremendous
faith in the ability of "managed care" to control health care
costs, which is not surprising considering the close ties between
them and the managed care industry <a href="#fn27">[27]</a>.  However, a recent
survey indicated that half of employers who switched from non-managed care
plans to HMO's said their HMO rates were as high
or higher than their previous rates <a href="#fn28">[28]</a>. Likewise, a
Congressional Budget Office Report found that shifting Medicare patients to
HMO's "had little or no effect on hospital use and costs." <a
href="#fn29">[29]</a> In
addition, a recent Rand corporation study indicates that managed
care providers were as likely as fee-for-service providers to
perform unnecessary procedures. <a href="#fn30">[30]</a></p>

<p> It is very difficult to judge whether managed competition can
deliver its promised cost savings because no such system
currently exists anywhere in the world. However, it is at least
worth noting that one of the models for managed competition
cited by the Jackson Hole Group is the Federal Employee Health
Benefits Program (FEHBP) <a href="#fn31">[31]</a>.  However, despite recent
enthusiasm for FEHBP by some conservative groups such as the
Heritage Foundation <a href="#fn32">[32]</a>,  FEHBP costs have actually risen
faster than employer-provided health benefits in general <a
href="#fn33">[33]</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name=libertarian>The Libertarian Alternative</a></h2>

<p> The Libertarian Party believes that the only health care
reforms which are likely to have a significant impact on
America's health care problems are those that draw on
the strength of the free market. The Libertarian Party has
developed a comprehensive proposal for health care reform that
will reduce health care costs, while extending access to care. It
is a program based on the idea that health care is a personal
responsibility, not a government one.</p>

<p> 1. Medical Savings Accounts.</p>

<p> Under federal tax law, money spent by an employer on a
worker's health insurance is not counted as taxable income to the
worker. Thus, even though that money is part of the worker's
total compensation, the worker avoids paying any income or
payroll taxes on it.</p>

<p> This tax treatment gives American workers and their families
very generous tax relief on their medical expenses, but only on
two conditions. First, they must obtain their medical care through
health insurance. And second, they must obtain their health
insurance through their employer.</p>

<p> In many cases, however, it would be more desirable or cost
effective to purchase low-cost or routine medical care directly
out-of-pocket rather than filing an insurance claim, or to buy a
different health insurance plan than the one offered by the
employer. Workers are heavily penalized for doing this because
they receive no tax relief for doing so.</p>

<p> To make matters worse, a worker who has employer-sponsored
health insurance, who is cost-conscious, and seeks out providers
who offer good quality at good prices, is not rewarded, since he
or she cannot pocket any savings. Moreover, physicians who
dispense more services, regardless of their benefit, or charge
higher prices, are rewarded with more income.</p>

<p> One method of solving this problem is the adoption of Medical
Savings Accounts (MSA) <a href="#fn34">[34]</a>,  under which an individual
should be exempted from taxes on money deposited in a medical savings
account in the same way that he currently pays no taxes on
deposits to an IRA. Money could be withdrawn from an MSA
without penalty to pay medical expenses <a href="#fn35">[35]</a>.  This would
increase consumer responsibility, while increasing access and controlling
costs. With such a program in place, employers could be
expected to change the way they provide insurance. Rather than
continuing to provide high-cost insurance benefits, with low
deductibles and extensive benefits, employers could provide
each employee with an annual allowance of perhaps $2,000,
which the employee could deposit in the MSA. For medical
expenses in excess of the $2,000, the employer would continue
to provide health insurance, but such catastrophic coverage
would be relatively inexpensive.</p>

<p> The individual would be responsible for paying his own health
care expenses under $2,000, using funds from the account <a
href="#fn36">[36]</a>.  It
should be noted that less than 12.5% of all insured individuals
have annual claims in excess of $2,000 <a href="#fn37">[37]</a>.</p>

<p> Unspent money in the account would accumulate and belong to
the account holder. Prior to age 65, there would be a penalty
applied to withdrawals for other than health care expenditures.</p>

<p> 2. Establish Tax Equity.</p>

<p> A second consumer-based reform is changing those tax laws that
discriminate against people that do not have employer-provided
health insurance. The solution: All health care expenditures
should be 100% tax deductible. In addition to expanding health
care access, such tax changes would 1) establish a basic fairness
in government policy -- giving the same tax break to the waitress
who has to buy her own health insurance that we are currently
giving to the well paid executives of wealthy corporations, and 2)
would hold down overall health care costs by increasing consumer
involvement in the health care marketplace.</p>

<p> The difference in tax treatment creates a disparity that effectively
doubles the cost of health insurance for those people who must
purchase their own. For example, the family of a self-employed
person, earning $35,000 per year, having to pay federal and
state taxes with only a 25% deduction, and having to pay Social
Security taxes, must earn $7,075 to pay for a $4,000 health
insurance policy. A person working for a small business that
offers no health insurance, would have to earn $8,214 to pay for
that $4,000 policy.</p>

<p> The results of this inequity can be clearly seen. Those workers
who must use after-tax dollars to purchase health insurance are
24 times more likely to be uninsured than those who are eligible
for tax-free employer-provided coverage <a href="#fn38">[38]</a>.</p>

<p> Significantly, the poor and minorities, who are less likely to have
employer-provided insurance, are the most likely to be left
without access to health insurance <a href="#fn39">[39]</a>.  Thus, the
perverse impact of our tax policies is to subsidize the purchase of health
insurance by the most affluent in society, while penalizing those less well
off <a href="#fn40">[40]</a>.</p>

<p> While limiting access to health insurance, our tax policies also
have an adverse impact on health care prices. By encouraging
employer-provided coverage to the detriment of individually-purchased
coverage and/or out-of-pocket payment, our tax
policy increases the trend toward divorcing the health care
consumer from health care payment.</p>

<p> As discussed previously, most health care consumers do not pay
for their health care. On the average, for every dollar of health
care services purchased, 76 cents is paid by someone other than
the consumer who purchased it <a href="#fn41">[41]</a>.  As a result, consumers
have little incentive to question costs and every incentive to demand
more services.</p>

<p> Establishing tax equity will encourage health care consumers to
become more involved in the health care system. Individuals who
purchase their own insurance are more likely to "shop around"
for the best deal. And, individuals who purchase health care out-of-pocket
are much more likely to make cost-conscious health
care decisions <a href="#fn42">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>3. Deregulate the health care industry.</p>

<p> There should be a thorough examination of the extent to which
government policies are responsible for rising health costs and
the unavailability of health care services. We can help lower
health care costs and expand health care access by taking
immediate steps to deregulate the health care industry, including
elimination of mandated benefits, repeal of the Certificate-of-Need
program, and expansion of the scope of practice for non-physician
health professionals.</p>

<p> For example, having decided that people are not smart enough
to choose their own health insurance benefits, every state has
laws that mandate that all health insurance contracts in their state
provide for coverage of specific disabilities/diseases and the
provision of specific health care services. These mandates add
significantly to the cost of health insurance <a href="#fn43">[43]</a>.</p>

<p> Blue Cross and Blue Shield of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/md/">Maryland</a> estimates
that mandated
benefits account for 13.3 percent of all claims dollars <a
href="#fn44">[44]</a>.  And, in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ma/">Massachusetts</a>,
Blue Cross and Blue Shield estimates that mandated
benefits add nearly $55 per month to the cost of a policy <a
href="#fn45">[45]</a>.
Surveys of small businesses have repeatedly shown that the cost
of health insurance is the number one reason why these
businesses do not offer health benefits. By making insurance
more expensive, mandated benefits are contributing directly to
the number of uninsured.</p>

<p> In addition, a majority of states continue to maintain regulatory
restrictions on health care services that act as a barrier to
competition, such as Certificate-of-Need requirements. This is
a regulation that says that if someone wants to build a new
hospital, or buy a new piece of medical equipment, or offer a new
type of medical service, they must first get permission from the
government.</p>

<p> Certificate-of-Need is based on the bizarre economic theory that
greater supply and increased competition will lead to higher
prices. However, studies have repeatedly demonstrated that
CON programs not only fail to contain costs, but may actually
lead to increased costs, while limiting the availability of medical
services, particularly in rural areas. The Trade Commission has
concluded that, on a national basis, "Hospital costs would decline
by $1.3 billion per year if states would deregulate their CON
programs <a href="#fn46">[46]</a>. </p>

<p> We also need to rethink our medical licensing laws. Studies have
repeatedly shown that qualified mid-level nonphysician practitioners
can perform many medical services traditionally performed by physicians.
Yet, the medical profession has consistently used licensure and other
regulatory restrictions to limit competition. The result has almost
inevitably been higher prices for consumers. For example, 37 states continue
to outlaw the practice of lay midwifery. In most states, nurse practitioners
cannot treat a patient without direct physician supervision.
Chiropractors cannot order blood tests or CAT scans. Nurses,
psychologists, pharmacists and other practitioners cannot prescribe
even the most basic medications <a href="#fn47">[47]</a>.</p>

<p> Deregulating the health care industry will reduce the cost of
health care overall, making health insurance more affordable
and, therefore, easier to obtain.</p>

<p> 4. Replace the FDA.</p>

<p> The Food and Drug Administration is one of the most dangerous
and counter-productive of all federal government agencies. The
mission of the FDA is obstensibly to protect the public from
unsafe and ineffective medicines (and foods of course). However,
in reality, the FDA has provided little protection, but has driven
up health care costs and deprived millions of Americans of the
health care treatment they need.</p>

<p> It now costs more than $231 million to bring a new drug to
market, an increase of 327% since 1976. It also takes approximately
12 years to complete the process <a href="#fn48">[48]</a>.  A substantial
portion of that time and money is the result of the FDA approval process.
Indeed, some studies indicate that the FDA doubles the cost of
developing a new drug <a href="#fn49">[49]</a>.  The cost, of course, is passed
along in the form of higher prices for consumers. In addition, the high cost
of the approval process acts as a barrier to entry, benefiting large
pharmaceutical companies, by preventing competition from
smaller firms that have limited financial resources.</p>

<p> Even more tragic is the loss of human life that results from delays
caused by the FDA approval process. For example, during the
10-year delay in allowing propanolol (the first widely used beta-blocker
for treatment of angina and hypertension) to be marketed
in the United states, approximately 100,000 people died because
the drug was unavailable <a href="#fn50">[50]</a>.  In addition, according to
George Hitchings, winner of the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine,
the FDA delay in approving the anti-bacterial drug Sepra cost
more than 80,000 lives <a href="#fn51">[51]</a>.</p>

<p> Now the FDA is attempting to expand its reach, seeking to
extend its authority to cover such items as vitamins and herbal
remedies. The agency is also seeking broader subpoena, seizure
and surveillance powers.</p>

<p> The FDA is clearly an unnecessary burden on the American
health care system. There is no evidence that the agency offers
Americans any real protection, but there is massive evidence that
it is causing great harm. The agency should be abolished and
replaced with voluntary certification by a private-sector organization,
similar to the way Underwriters Laboratory certifies
electrical appliances.</p>

<p> 5. Privatize Medicare and Medicaid.</p>

<p> The current Medicare and Medicaid systems have clearly failed.
Costs are skyrocketing. Medicare costs have increased to the
point where the system is in serious jeopardy. Medicare Part A,
which pays for hospital care and services, is projected to be
unable to meet its financial commitments by the year 2005. It is
estimated that to restore the fund's financial stability will require
increasing the Medicare payroll tax from 2.9% to at least 6.5%.
Medicare Part B, which pays for physician services, is hardly in
better shape. General revenue contributions to Medicare Part B
may increase 300% by the end of the century. And, premium
contributions by the elderly may have to increase by a similar
percentage <a href="#fn52">[52]</a>.</p>

<p> Medicaid is in much the same condition. The state share of the
joint federal-state program is growing twice as fast as overall
state spending. Some estimates indicate that state spending on
Medicaid could increase a phenomenal 480% by the year 2000.
The federal share of the program is growing even faster <a
href="#fn53">[53]</a>.</p>

<p> At the same time, patients are receiving second rate care. Studies
have shown that both Medicaid and Medicare patients have
higher mortality rates than patients with private insurance.</p>

<p> Finally, providers are being shortchanged. Both Medicare and
Medicaid reimburse providers at a rate well below the actual cost
of procedures. As a result, fewer and fewer providers are willing
to participate in the program. Those who do, pass along their
costs to patients with private insurance, a practice known as
cost-shifting.</p>

<p> The time is ripe for drastic reform. The federal government
should begin to restructure the system to give Medicaid and
Medicare recipients more flexibility to purchase private health
insurance. Some experts suggest a voucher system would be a
solid interim measure to bring Medicare and Medicaid recipients
back into the private sector <a href="#fn54">[54]</a>.  Other experts point to
the potential for expanding the role of nonprofit charitable institutions in
replacing government programs <a href="#fn55">[55]</a>.</p>

<title>Health Care Fallacies</title>

<body>
<h1>Fallacies of the Health Care Debate</h1>

<p>August 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom
Isenberg</a>:</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Health care is a human right."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "No, health care is a product.  And you don't have the
right 
to force someone else to produce it for you.  That kind of slavery is a 
violation of real human rights."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Health care is a right".</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "Yes, you do have a right to health care. But  no one has 
an <em>obligation</em> to give it to you. You have a right to bear arms, but 
no one has an obligation to provide you with a gun. You have a right to 
free speech but no one has an obligation to listen to you."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Nationalized health care is necessary to give everyone
access 
to affordable health care."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "Then why don't we nationalize food, clothing, housing, 
jobs, transportation, sex, entertainment, and toilet paper? Doesn't 
everyone have a right to those necessities, as well?  And what makes 
you think it will work better here than it did in the Soviet Union?"</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Gun control is a health-care issue."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "Yes, without my gun, it is more difficult to defend my 
health from bad people and bad government."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "These opponents of nationalized health care are the same 
people who opposed Social Security, welfare, and Medicare."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "Any decent person who could have foreseen the disastrous 
consequences of these programs would have opposed them.  Let's not make 
the same mistake with our health care."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Demand the same right Congress has: guaranteed health
coverage."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b> "Why stop there?  Let's also demand the other 'rights' 
Congress has: $100K salaries, exemption from its own laws, and the 
power to control your life and spend your money."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Clinton at least deserves credit for starting the debate on

health care reform."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "Yes, and we should thank O.J. Simpson for starting the 
debate on domestic violence."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "Americans should stop whining.  Compared to other
countries, 
Americans are undertaxed."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "And compared to many countries, Americans are
under-raped."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "America is the only industrialized country that does not 
provide 100% health care coverage."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "And if all the other industrialized countries jumped off
a 
bridge, would you too?"</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "We're just asking people to pay their fair share."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "Government is not about asking, it is about telling.  And

with the understood threat of violence if you do not fork over your 'fair
share.'"</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CLICHE:</b>  "The US spends a higher percentage of its GDP on health care

than any nation in the world."</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>  "You get what you pay for, and that's why the US has the 
best health care system in the world.  To lower costs, we must increase 
competition among suppliers (by deregulating the existing physician and 
insurance cartels and monopolies and legalizing competition among all 
would-be health-care and insurance providers.)</p>

<title>Drug Bigotry</title>
<!-- Place: global -->
<!-- Time: eternal -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Roots of Drug Prohibition</h1>

<p>Far from a noble cause, drug prohibition started in the United States in
bigotry and hatred. "Zero tolerance" is indeed an apt description for drug
prohibition, based as it is in fear and intolerance.</p>

<p>"We hold the presence of the Chinese in our midst as an unmitigated evil,
ruinous alike to the people and the State," said the 1872 Platform of the
California Democratic Party. In this atmosphere of intolerance that the first
drug laws were passed in the United States.</p>

<p>The first U.S. drug laws banned importation of opium by Chinese, but not by
whites. It was explicitly racist, and motivated by racist fear that white
women, after visiting "opium dens," would actually sleep with Chinese men.</p>

<p>Each drug was associated with a detested minority, and the drug prohibited
in order to harass and persecute minorities.</p>

<p>Cocaine was linked to blacks (and still is). Use of crack cocaine, more
popular in predominantly black areas, has harsher penalties and stricter
enforcement than use of powder cocaine, more popular in white communities but
nearly identical in effects. (Crack's presumed stronger potency and
addictiveness is more drug war propaganda.)</p>

<p>Marijuana was linked to Latinos. In fact, marijuana was a staple crop in
this country until the 1940's, but it was known then as "hemp." Opponents of
recreational hemp use and of Latino immigrants began calling hemp "marijuana"
in order to make it appear foreign.</p>

<p>Alcohol was linked to German, Irish and Italian immigrants. Few people today
realize the intense bigotry shown towards those European immigrants in the
early 1900's. Alcohol Prohibition was not a Noble Experiment, but yet another
experiment in intolerance.</p>

<p>Bigotry is not merely an artifact of drug war history. It is an inherent
part of drug policy today. Drug enforcers use "profiles" to target minorities
for traffic stops and searches. Enforcement efforts are strongest in
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://hyperreal.com/drugs/politics/misc/is.drug.war.racist">minority
communities</a>, despite illegal drug use being spread almost evenly through the
population.</p>

<p>In 1995, the ACLU won a <a
href="/revolution/body/drugs/rights/enforce/wilkins.html">case
against the use of racist "profiles"</a>. Federal prisoners rioted after
the U.S. Congress <a
href="/revolution/body/drugs/rights/enforce/riots.html">rejected
a U.S. Sentencing Commission recommendation</a> to eliminate the racial
disparity in penalties for cocaine offenses.</p>

<title>Drug Rights</title>
<!-- Place: global -->
<!-- Time: eternal -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Drug Rights</h1>

<p>Drug prohibition is a violation of the fundamental right of every individual
to control his or her own body. Drug prohibition involves the use of force to
jail people and to extract money from people to pay for it all. It is an
absolute moral principle, to libertarians and any rational persons, that force
is wrong except when used in defense.</p>

<p>What justifies this use of force? Against whom are drug users or dealers
committing violence?</p>

<p>Some argue that the use of drugs is violence against "the community." But
the community is an abstraction meaning all the individuals who comprise it.
The community does not think or act, and it does not have rights. Only
individuals think, act and have rights. Your right to live in the type of
community you desire does not permit you to force others to live in such a
community.</p>

<p>Some argue that communities have the right to enforce any code of behavior
they desire. The first flaw in this argument is that again, the community is an
abstraction, and does not have desires. How do you express the desire of a
community? Advocates of enforced morality vary in answers to this question,
from majority-rule to the divine right of kings. Thinking people will certainly
recognize that individuals have rights that no majority, however large, can
morally infringe. Otherwise, the Nazi genocide of Jews and other tragedies
littering human history are justifiable.</p>

<p>Are dealers committing violence against users? This argument maintains that
drugs eliminate choice, presumably by addiction. Consider the implications of
this argument: surely drug use should be legal, since drug use does not even
involve choice, much less criminal intent. Growing or manufacturing drugs for
personal use should be legal, since a person cannot coerce himself. And if a
person is capable of choosing to grow, manufacture and use a drug, why is that
person incapable of choosing to purchase the drug?</p>

<title>1993 Drug Survey</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: survey 1993, released July 20, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Clinton Administration Reveals 70 Million Americans Have Consumed
Marijuana</h1>

<p>July 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/K/RobKampia.html">Rob
Kampia</a>, Chapter Coordinator of <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NORML.html">NORML</a>:</p>

<p>On Wednesday, July 20, the Department of Health and Human Services released
the 1993 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, which found that
"Americans' use of illegal drugs leveled off last year after 13 straight
years of declines," according to the Associated Press.</p>

<p>The survey, which has been conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) every 2 or 3 years since 1972, found that 11.7 million Americans used at
least one illicit drug in the previous month.</p>

<p>The survey results regarding marijuana consumption include:</p>

<ul>
<li>CURRENT USE:  9 million Americans used marijuana in the previous month.
<li>OCCASIONAL USE:  9.6 million used marijuana in the past year but less
often than monthly.
<li>LIFETIME PREVALENCE:  Almost 70 million have used marijuana at least
once in their lifetimes.
</ul>

<p>NORML disputes the survey's finding that fewer than 10 million people have
used marijuana in the past year:  The government's estimates of the quantity
of marijuana being imported and grown in the United States suggest that
approximately 30 million Americans consume marijuana.  Also, the accuracy of
any survey based on people admitting illegal activities is questionable.</p>

<p>Lee Brown, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
admitted that the survey might underrepresent the actual number of consumers
because "it excludes the homeless, prisoners, people living at colleges,
active military and those in other institutions," according to the Associated
Press.</p>

<p>NORML holds that a survey that does not include these populations cannot
accurately reflect the extent of marijuana consumption in the United States.
 Additionally, until Marijuana Prohibition is repealed and people feel more
free to be honest about their marijuana consumption, it will be difficult to
accurately assess the extent of the use and abuse of marijuana across the
United States.</p>

<title>Marijuana Use Up</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1992 - 1995; survey released September 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Drug Survey Shows Prohibition's Failure</h1>


<p>Gee, after over fifty years of prohibition, people still use illegal
drugs. Imagine that.</p>

<p>A 1995 survey of illegal drug use in the U.S., released by the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the U.S. government,
summarizes the result of 22,181 interviews.</p>

<p>Teenage reported use of marijuana nearly doubled from 1992 to 1995, from 4%
to 7.3%. Use of illegal drugs rose from an estimated 11.7 million people
in 1993 to an estimated 12.2 million people in 1995. Since the survey relies
on self-reported drug use, the actual number is probably higher.</p>

<p>U.S. "drug czar" (the czars were tyrants, right?) Lee Brown blamed increased
pot use on glamorization by the entertainment industry, and promoted
new public service pamphlets with the slogan, "Stay Drug Free! You Have
the Power!"</p>

<p>The Libertarian alternative, in the face of drug war related property

<h1>Liverpool Clinic Mocks Drug Warriors</h1>

<p>February 6, 1995, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/G/MikeGray.html">Mike
Gray</a> of the <a href="/revolution/by_name/D/DRCNet.html">Drug Reform
Coordination Network</a>:</p>

<p>The British Health Service plans to terminate the 
contract with the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/Liverpool.html">Liverpool</a> drug
clinic that has recently become the focus 
of the international drug policy debate.  The clinic is one of the last in 
England operating under the rules of the so-called "British System" where 
addicts are given free prescriptions for their drug of choice.  Until the 
1960s, this practice was the norm in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">Great Britain</a>, and was credited by 
many experts with keeping the English addict population limited to a few 
hundred in total.  But over the last twenty-five years, outside forces -- 
largely from the United States -- have pressured the British to bring their 
policies in line with U.S. drug prohibition.  The concept of heroin and 
cocaine maintenance for addicts has been slowly replaced with a stringent 
methadone reduction policy intended to lead to total abstinence.</p>

<p>The Chapel Street Clinic in Widnes (a suburb of Liverpool) run by Dr. John 
Marks is the most famous holdout for the old system of free drug 
maintenance.  The incredible success of this small institution has been a 
stark contrast with the documented failure of the other alternatives.  
Unfortunately, the U.S. government has maintained constant pressure to shut 
down this glaring example of an approach that flies in the face of American 
drug war orthodoxy.</p>

<p>The situation became critical following a CBS "60 Minutes" broadcast on 
the clinic in 1990.  The facts in this story completely debased fundamental 
U.S. policy assumptions.  The most startling statistic was the crime rate.  
Beginning in 1988, the local police began tracking the criminal records of 
112 addicts who entered the drug maintenance program at Chapel Street.  
According to the Cheshire Drug Squad, there was a 93 percent drop in theft, 
burglary, and property crimes among this group over the next two years -- 
thus illuminating the age-old argument about whether it is the drugs 
themselves or the pursuit of drugs that drives addicts to criminal 
behavior.</p>

<p>In addition, the HIV infection rate among these injecting drug users was 
zero.  Zero.  And the incidence of death among addicts -- normally 15 
percent per year -- was also zero.</p>

<p>Even more significant was the fact that the incidence of new drug users in 
the Widnes-Holton area dropped dramatically -- contrary to popular 
assumptions.  Drug dealers simply stay away because they know the local 
addicts don't need them anymore.  And the addicts themselves have no reason 
to sell drugs since they can get whatever they need for nothing.</p>

<p>The "60 Minutes" broadcast and subsequent world-wide media attention -- 
MTV broadcast a segment from the clinic last fall -- has been a terrible 
embarrassment to the conservative governments of Margaret Thatcher, John 
Major, and their American allies.</p>

<p>The British government could not attack Dr. Marks directly because the 
British medical establishment -- unlike their American counterpart -- will 
not permit the state to get between a doctor and his patient.  So they 
attacked the clinic on the basis of economics, saying that heroin 
maintenance is too expensive and that Methadone is much cheaper.  A one-
year supply of heroin costs the clinic 10,000 pounds, where Methadone costs 
500 pounds.  And why does a synthetic drug cost less than the natural 
product?  Because a single British pharmaceutical company has been granted 
a heroin monopoly and they are allowed to charge whatever they want.</p>

<p>Last year the local health authority informed Dr. Marks that his services 
were too expensive and that the future health needs of the addicts in the 
district would be managed by the Warrington Health Clinic.  There they will 
be switched to a regime of Methadone maintenance and withdrawal.  Oddly, 
the Warrington Health Clinic has no trained personnel, their management was 
recently investigated for fraud, the chairman had just resigned -- and in 
fact, the clinic had not even bid for the contract.  Their solitary asset 
seems to be their Christian fundamentalist philosophy.</p>

<p>So on April 1st of this year, Dr. Marks' Chapel Street Clinic will lose its 
funding and 450 addicts now receiving maintenance doses will be out on the 
street.</p>

<p>For many years, researchers in England and elsewhere have been asking for a 
study of the British drug clinics to determine which approach is most 
successful.  This study has finally been commissioned.  It will start on 
April 1 -- the day Dr. Marks loses his funding.  Then the Methadone 
treatment centers in England will be able to avoid any embarrassing 
comparisons with a system that actually works.</p>

<p>In March of last year I visited the Chapel Street Clinic and met with 
several of the patients.  I sat in on a group session where eight heroin 
users discussed their lives and problems with a counselor before picking up 
their weekly prescriptions for pharmaceutical heroin.  Unlike the junkies 
we are used to seeing, this group was virtually indistinguishable from any 
other bunch of young adults on the streets of Liverpool.  They were well 
dressed, talkative, energetic -- they had jobs -- and they used heroin 
daily.</p>

<p>One of the most attractive was a young woman named Juliette who had been an
addict for 13 years.  She came from a middle-class background, married a
rich kid who got her into heroin, then left her with two kids and no money.
She tried desperately to kick but couldn't make it.  Somehow for ten years 
she managed to stay afloat through petty theft and prostitution, with the 
authorities breathing down her neck.  Finally, terrified that they were 
about to take her kids away, she happened to find the right doctor and he 
sent her to John Marks.  Marks gave her a check-up, satisfied himself that
she was indeed a heroin addict, and wrote her a prescription for a week's
supply.</p>

<p>"For the first time in ten years," she said, "I had spare time.  I didn't
have to worry that my dealer wouldn't show -- I didn't have to worry about 
the price or where to steal the money.  So for the first time in ten years, 
I had a minute to look in the mirror.  I looked and I said, `Oh, my God.'  
Then I looked at the kids, and I said, `What have I done?'  All these 
middle-class values came flooding back in on me."</p>

<p>Today Juliette has a job, a house, and a mortgage.  The kids are in school 
and doing well.  Everybody's in excellent health.  And once a week she 
comes to Chapel Street for her prescription.  I asked John Marks what will 
happen to Juliette on April 1.  He said, "Well, she'll go down the tubes."</p>

<title>Netherlands Drug Peace</title>
<!-- Place: The Netherlands -->
<!-- Time: September 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Netherlands Maintains Drug Peace</h1>

<p>For decades, the Netherlands has had the least restrictive drug
policy of any Western European nation. In September 1995, the Netherlands
reaffirmed its policy, but made some concessions to pressure from other
countries -- particularly <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/France/">France</a> -- to criminalize
more peaceful activity.</p>

<p>A French official was quoted by the Dutch ANP news agency as saying,
"I'm satisfied that a more repressive policy has finally come and The
Netherlands is catching up with its neighbours."</p>

<p>Although the Netherlands' drug policy statement declared no intention
to legalize any drugs, it also reaffirmed the existing policy of allowing
marijuana to be sold openly in "coffee shops" and expanded the amount of
marijuana which could be grown for personal use or sale to the coffee
shops.</p>

<p>Among the changes, individuals will only be able to buy five grams at
one time from a coffee shop rather than thirty grams (one ounce). Five grams
is enough for about eight to ten marijuana cigarettes. The reduction is aimed at
stopping "drug tourists" who buy marijuana in the Netherlands to take back
home to other countries.</p>

<p>In another change, individuals who grow marijuana for personal use or
for sale to coffee shops will not be prosecuted. The change is aimed to
limit the profits of black market organized crime.</p>

<P>The Dutch government also plans to give courts the power to put
hard drug addicts in compulsory rehabilitation programs, and to
start a heroin maintenance program.</p>

<title>1995 Drug Data Summary</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: issued June 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>1995 Drug Data Summary</h1>

<p>The Office of National Drug Control Policy (the "Drug Czar") Drugs
and Crime Clearinghouse issues an annual
Drug Data Summary, a statistical summary of drug law enforcement and
drug use. The data is collected from government agencies such as the DEA,
FBI and Federal Bureau of Prisons.</p>

<p>From the June 1995 Drug Data Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total number of drug law arrests: 1,066,400 in 1992; 1,126,300 in 1993.
<li>Drugs seized in fiscal year 1994 by all federal agencies: 2,824 pounds
of heroin; 282,086 pounds of cocaine; 778,714 pounds of marijuana.
<li>Average incarceration sentence of federal drug offenders: 47 months in 1980;
82 months in 1992.
<li>Total federal spending on drug control programs: $1.5 billion in fiscal
1981; $13.3 billion in fiscal 1995.
</ul>

<p>To all those who believe we just need to "get tough" to prohibit drugs:
despite increasing jail time by almost 100% and drug war spending by almost
1000% since 1980, the price of illegal drugs is still rising slower than
inflation.</p>

<title>Rohypnol Prohibition</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1990's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Rohypnol Prohibition Failing</h1>

<p>Advocates of prohibition are never distracted by their failures.
Despite the abject failure of every prohibition attempted by humankind,
whenever a new substance abuse problem arises the solution is always
another prohibition.</p>

<p>The painkiller/tranquilizer Rohypnol, called "roofies" by its
recreational users, started to become popular in the mid-1990's,
mainly in <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>
and <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a>.</p>

<p>Rohypnol, made by U.S. company Hoffman-La Roche in Mexico and Colombia,
is used legally in 64 countries before surgery and to treat
insomnia. It is banned in the United States.</p>

<p>Roofies are mainly used by teenagers to enhance an alcohol or
cocaine high. Prohibitionists point to cases of rape involving the
victim being drugged with roofies. Rape and drugging people are
already illegal, and many substances have been used to immobolize
victims of various crimes, with alcohol probably being the most
common.</p>

<p>Despite the full efforts of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration,
use of roofies has soared. One tablet cost as little as $1.50 in
mid-1996 in south Florida, about $5 lower than the previous year.
This greater availability comes after 42,000 pills confiscated between
October 1994 and September 1995, and more than 136,000 pills between
October 1995 and May 1996 in Florida alone.</p>

<p>Seeing prohibition's failure, police and lawmakers look to
more prohibition as a solution. Legislators increased the criminal
penalties for possessing and selling the drug, and the DEA wants
to move the drug to the most restricted category.</p>

<title>The Golden Triangle</title>
<!-- Place: Burma, Thailand and Laos-->
<!-- Time: 1990's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Golden Triangle Thrives Despite Enforcement Efforts</h1>

<p>Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle is a jungle area at the borders of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Burma/">Burma</a>,
Thailand and Laos,
named for the wealth generated by its abundance of opium. It is estimated
that more than 60% of heroin sold in the U.S. is produced from Golden
Triangle opium. Drug barons command private armies, competing for territory
and market share.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, Burmese officials succeeded in driving the best
known drug baron, 61-year-old Khun Sa, into hiding, and in disrupting
his operations. Half his army defected in 1995 and his group's share
of the Burmese market declined from about 80% in 1989 to less than 50%
in 1994.</p>

<p>Khun Sa's defeat made no difference on the opium trade. Numerous
organizations have expanded their operations, and many even have cease-fire
agreements with the Burmese government that allow them to continue smuggling
with less interference.</p>

<p>Rebel groups throughout the world -- from Afghanistan to Nicaragua to
the Golden Triangle -- have recognized the value drugs
have in financing their military operations. As long as there are
minority groups willing to start a rebellion, there will be an
international drug trade. Unless, of course, drugs are legalized,
at which point the profits and incentives supporting the guerillas
disappear.</p>

will make no dent in drug trade, officials say," reprinted in the

<title>Police Lie for Drug War</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: always -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Police Lie for Drug War</h1>

<p>Former San Jose police chief
<a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JosephMacNamara.html">Joseph MacNamara</a>
estimates that hundreds of thousands of police officers lie every year
in order to make drug arrests. Cops feel such perjury is not wrong because
politicians reward such behavior and because the victims are mostly
poor blacks and Latinos.</p>

<p>As MacNamara said in the Philadelphia <cite>Enquirer</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The federal government reports that more than 1.3 million drug
arrests were made in 1994, 480,000 of which involved marijuana.
About 1 million of the total drug arrests were for possession, not
selling.</p>

<p>Despite government drug-war propaganda that big-time dealers are its
targets, only 24 percent of the total drug arrests were for selling.
Almost all those arrested for selling are small-timers, in large
part supporting their own drug use. Often they are inveigled by
undercover police to up the ante. Many of the arrests for selling
are made without search warrants and almost all the possession
arrests are without warrants.</p>

<p>In other words, hundreds of thousands of police officers swear under
oath that the drugs were in plain view or that the defendant gave
consent to a search.</p>

<p>... Leaders of the drug war dehumanize their ``enemy'' -- not just
foreign drug traffickers but also American users. This mentality
pushes the police into making ever more arrests, arrests that can
only survive in court because of perjured police testimony. The fact
that enforcement falls most heavily on people of color also
encourages illegal police tactics. Non-whites are arrested at four
to five times the rates whites are arrested for drug crimes,
regardless of the fact that 80 percent of drug crimes are committed
by whites.</p>

<p>... Some officers in the New York City police and New York State police
departments were convicted of falsifying drug evidence. Yet,
President Clinton appointed the heads of those agencies to be drug
czar and chief of the Drug Enforcement Agency, respectively, and
they were confirmed in the Senate.</p>

<p>Will Lester reported in the June 5, 1995 San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite>
that the U.S. Attorney's office indicted more than sixty people as a result
of an investigation into the Cali cocaine cartel.</p>

<p>Three former U.S. Department of Justice lawyers (including the former head
of the department's office of internal affairs), two former federal
prosecutors and a former federal attorney were indicted, along
with smugglers, distributors and lawyers in the U.S. and in Colombia.</p>

<p>The indictment, most of whose information came from a captured smuggler's
computer files, claimed the Cali cartel brings in 80 percent of the U.S.
cocaine supply. The U.S. Attorney's office warned that Colombia must have the
"resolve" to arrest the indicted Cali cartel leaders, or the U.S. will continue
to import "record levels" of cocaine.</p>

<p>Now, not too long ago, the Medellin cartel was the Bad Guy who imported all
our cocaine. "Resolve" to bust the Medellin cartel, combined with literally
cut-throat competition from Cali, served only to change the names and home
base of the Bad Guys. Why will this time be any different? As long as there is
demand, there will be suppliers. All the "resolve" in the world won't change
that basic fact.</p>

<title>New Orleans Cops</title>
<!-- Place: New Orleans, Louisiana (USA) -->
<!-- Time: reported December 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Nine Cops Indicted in New Orleans</h1>

<p>Reuter news service reported in December 1994 on the latest charges of
police abuse in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/NewOrleans.html">New Orleans</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/">Louisiana</a>. Nine
New Orleans police officers,
including one already arrested for ordering a murder, were indicted on
drug charges.</p>

<p>Said Reuter, "Eastern Louisiana district U.S. Attorney Eddie J. Jordan said
the officers, who face 15 years to life in prison if convicted, were charged
with protecting the storage and movement of more than 130 kilograms of
cocaine. ... FBI Special Agent in Charge Neil Gallagher said the officers
protected a warehouse where the cocaine was stored and were paid in excess
of $97,000 in bribes. Some of the officers used official New Orleans police
cars in the conspiracy to distribute the cocaine."</p>

<p>Len Davis, 30, was arrested by the FBI for conspiring to violate the
civil rights of 32-year-old Kim Groves by ordering and celebrating her
killing after she filed a brutality complaint against him.</p>

<p>Other officers indicted were Sammy L. Williams Jr., Christopher Evans,
Adam E. Dees, Sgt. Carlos Rodriguez, Keith Johnson, Brian K. Brown,
Sheldon Polk and Larry Smith Jr.</p>

<p>Between 1991 and 1995, more than <em>forty five</em> New Orleans police
officers have been charged with crimes including murder, rape, bank robbery,
racketeering, drug trafficking, bribery, auto theft and aggravated battery.
Keep that in mind if you're ever pulled over while vacationing New Orleans.</p>

<title>Philly Cops Fabricated Evidence</title>
<!-- Place: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (USA) -->
<!-- Time: theft 1988 - 1991;
	cops indicted February 28, 1995;
	sentenced April 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Cops Sentenced for Theft, Lying</h1>

<p>Like other laws against victimless crimes, drug laws are impossible
to enforce uniformly and impossible to enforce while observing
inherent human rights. Drug laws always lead to laws eroding other rights
and giving police more powers. These, in turn, inevitably lead to police
abusing their powers against people they don't like.</p>

<p>From 1988 to 1991, a group of four policemen in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/Philadelphia.html">Philadelphia's</a>
39th police district stole $100,000 from drug dealers and sent innocent
people to prison. In a February 1991 incident that sparked the investigation
into the crimes, two policemen stopped a college student, roughed him up,
searched through his apartment and threatened to kill him, because they
mistook him for a drug dealer.</p>

<p>In April 1996, five policemen were sentenced to federal prison terms
ranging from 10 months to 13 years. In addition, criminal charges have
been filed against officers in other police districts and in the
city's highway patrol unit.</p>

<p>The investigation uncovered that the police planted evidence and gave
false testimony, evidence of corruption that could
lead to the review of a thousand drug cases. A specially assigned judge
had already dismissed charges against twenty-seven defendants by early
1995, and over a hundred drug convictions have been overturned.</p>

<p>"Many innocent defendants have spent years in prison," said Public Defender
Bradley Bridge. Betty Patterson, 53, completed her three-year
prison term in 1994. The investigation revealed that police
framed her and planted drugs in her home. John Wayne Coleman, who has
spent the last four years in prison, was another whose
case was dismissed.</p>

<p>Police are able to get away with such egregious violations of human
rights because the drug war demonizes drug users and dealers, especially
minority ones. No one cares when hundreds of poor minorities are treated
in this manner, because after all, they're all drug users, right?  At least no
one cares until a college student gets mistaken for one.</p>

<title>Connecticut Legalizes Needles</title>
<!-- Place: Connecticut (USA) -->
<!-- Time: legalized 1992; report 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Connecticut Legalizes Needles</h1>

<p>Among the side-effects of drug prohibition is its ever-widening scope.
Faced with failure of prohibition, prohibitionists seek more prohibition:
if drug prohibition doesn't work, then let's prohibit needles, pipes,
laughing gas, lab beakers, perfume vials, public pay phones, anything that
might somehow be connected to drug use.</p>

<p>These "side" prohibitions have their own harmful effects. Repealing
them erases these harmful effects.</p>

<p>For example, forty-five states prohibit carrying a needle and syringe. The
main side effect of this is for drug addicts to share needles, leading to high
rates of disease transmission.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ct/">Connecticut</a>
legalized the sale of syringes in 1992. After three years,
needle sharing among addics was down 40 percent, and street sales of needles
had dropped sharply.</p>

<p>Connecticut,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ak/">Alaska</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nd/">North Dakota</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ia/">Iowa</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/sc/">South Carolina</a> have
legalized needles.</p>

<hr>

<p>Source: AP story "Legal purchase of needles cuts down on sharing," in the
August 30, 1995 San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite>.</p>

<title>Asset Forfeiture Justice Act</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: ??? -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Asset Forfeiture Justice Act</h1>

<p>This is a section-by-section analysis of the Asset Forfeiture Justice Act
introduced by Congressman John Conyers. (I've lost the author's name and the
date.) Although the bill went nowhere, this analysis shows how badly reform
is needed.</p>

<hr>

<p>This bill provides comprehensive due process and oversight
protections for individuals subject to civil asset forfeiture and
redistributes the assets seized.</p>

<p>SEC. 2.  REQUIRE CONVICTION</p>

<p>This section requires that forfeiture of property not occur
until the owner has been convicted of a crime upon which the
forfeiture is based.  The owner has no property rights in any 
contraband, including controlled substances and drug paraphernalia.</p>

<p>SEC. 3. NOTICE</p>

<p>This section requires that notice by sent to the owner or
other interested parties (i.e. lienholder) no later than 60 days
after the property is seized.</p>

<p>SEC. 4. BURDEN OF PROOF</p>

<p>This section shifts the burden of proof to the government
and raises the standard of proof required for civil forfeiture
proceedings to clear and convincing evidence.</p>

<p>SEC. 5. PRELIMINARY HEARING</p>

<p>This section requires a preliminary adversarial hearing
prior to seizure.</p>

<p>Exemptions include:  cases in which seizure is incident to 
arrest, or search under a search warrant, or an inspection under 
an administrative inspection warrant, and those cases involving
exigent circumstances, i.e., highway and airport stops.  A
preliminary hearing will be granted immediately after seizure.</p>

<p>SEC. 6 ELIMINATION OF BOND: ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION</p>

<p>This section eliminates the bond requirement (10% of the
value of the property or $2500, whichever is less), and allows
the property owner to file a claim within 60 days from the date
of notice that the property was seized.  It also establishes the 
right to adequate counsel.</p>

<p>SEC. 7. RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL</p>

<p>This section establishes the right to a jury trial in civil
forfeiture cases.</p>

<p>SEC. 8. ATTORNEYS' FEES</p>

<p>Under this section, any property which has been paid or
pledged to pay for attorney fees cannot be subject to forfeiture
proceedings.</p>

<p>SEC. 9. IN PERSONAM</p>

<p>This section prohibits civil forfeiture proceedings from
being held <cite>in rem</cite> (actions instituted against the thing) and
requires them to be held <cite>in personam</cite> (actions directed to a 
specific person) thereby extending due process protections to
property owners.</p>

<p>SEC. 10. FILING DEADLINES</p>

<p>This section lengthens the filing deadline for property
claimants from 10 to 60 days.</p>

<p>SEC. 11 PROPORTIONALITY</p>

<p>This section establishes that the value of the property
seized must be less than or of equal value to the value of the
property involved in the offense.</p>

<p>SEC. 12. ELIMINATION OF THE RELATION-BACK DOCTRINE</p>

<p>At present, the "relation-back doctrine" gives title to the
government of property at the moment that it is involved in
criminal activity.  This section vests the right, title, and
interest in property only after a verdict in favor of the government.</p>

<p>SEC. 13. PROPERTY SUBJECT TO SEIZURE</p>

<p>This section limits the types of property subject to seizure
to the drugs, raw materials, products, equipment, property used
or intended for use as a container, aircraft, vehicles, or
vessels, weapons, and equipment used in a drug enterprise.</p>

<p>SEC. 14. FORFEITURE PROCEEDS TO STATE TREASURIES</p>

<p>Under this section, all forfeiture proceeds transferred to
state and local law enforcement will be transferred directly to
State treasuries, for disposition according to State law.</p>

<p>SEC. 15. EXPANDED USE OF FORFEITURE PROCEEDS</p>

<p>Under this section, federal forfeiture proceeds will be made
available for community-based crime control programs, and drug
treatment, prevention and education programs.</p>

<p>This section also allocates fifty percent of forfeiture
proceeds for drug treatment, prevention and education programs,
and community-based crime control program[sic]. Not more than 10
percent of the total disbursed may be used for administrative costs.</p>

<p>SEC. 16. PAYMENT OF INFORMANTS</p>

<p>Under this section the total paid to any individual 
informant is limited to $250,000 per person per year. [It is
currently $250,000 or 25% of the value per <em>seizure</em>. -CY] This
section also requires the Attorney General to publish data
annually regarding the awards paid.</p>

<p>SEC. 17. ADOPTIVE SEIZURE</p>

<p>This section prohibits the States from transferring property
to the Federal government for the purpose of circumventing State
or local laws limiting use of disposal of the proceeds.</p>

<p>SEC. 18 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</p>

<p>This section requires data to be maintained regarding all
persons from whom property is seized, including race, national
origin, gender and age.</p>

<p>This section also requires the States to account for the
disposition of all proceeds.</p>

<p>SEC. 19. MAINTENANCE OF SEIZED PROPERTY</p>

<p>This section requires the return of all property seized if 
forfeiture proceedings have not been initiated within one year
from the data of seizure.</p>

<p>This section also requires payment of interest on any seized
coins, currency or negotiable instruments at a rate of six
percent, or the prevailing market rate, whichever is higher.
Compensation will be paid for any injury incurred by the property seized.</p>

<p>SEC. 20. ADMINISTRATIVE AND CONTRACTING EXPENSES</p>

<p>This section limits administrative and contracting expenses
for each fiscal year to ten percent of the total amount paid from
the Asset Forfeiture Fund.</p>

<p>SEC. 21. REPORT OF CONGRESS</p>

<p>This section requires the Attorney General to transmit to
Congress a detailed report containing a description of the 
administrative and contracting expenses paid from the Fund at the
end of each fiscal year.</p>

<p>SEC. 22. NOMINAL CONSIDERATION SALES OF LOW VALUE REAL PROPERTY</p>

<p>This section requires the Attorney General to make nominal
consideration sales of low value real property available to tax-
exempt organizations that provide direct services furthering

<h1>Wisconsin Enacts Law that Allows Landlords to Evict Suspected Drug
Consumers</h1>

<p>July 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/K/RobKampia.html">Rob
Kampia</a>, Chapter Coordinator of <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NORML.html">NORML</a>:</p>

<p>On March 9, 1994, the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wi/">Wisconsin</a> state
legislature enacted into law 1993
Senate Bill 131 which allows landlords to evict tenants on hearsay before they
are convicted of -- or even charged with -- a drug-related crime.</p>

<p>The Wisconsin state Legislative Reference Bureau's analysis of the bill
reads as follows:</p>

<p>"This bill allows landlords to evict tenants within 5 days after giving
notice if the landlord receives notice from a law enforcement officer that a
drug-related nuisance exists in the tenant's rental unit.  The tenant has the
right to contest the eviction, and the city, town or village is held harmless
for errors in providing notices."</p>

<p>NORML finds this law appalling for a number of obvious reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The law does not require that a tenant be convicted of-or even charged
with-a drug offense for a property owner to evict him or her.  The police
need only notify the property owner that they believe a "drug-related
nuisance exists."
<li>The law gives the police greater power to harass those whom they suspect
are involved with drug-related activity without requiring a criminal
conviction.
</ul>

<p>NORML poses the question:  Does Wisconsin law allow property owners to evict
tenants who are suspected -- or even convicted -- of assault and battery, rape,
or murder?</p>

<h1>Justice Goes To Pot</h1>

<p>by B. J. Oppenheimer</p>

<p>As you read this, I'll probably be behind bars, serving a possible five
to 40 years in federal prison with no hope of parole.  My house will have
been confiscated by the government, and a fine of $340,000 will have been
levied against me.</p>

<p>I'm a nonviolent offender with no prior record. Married for 20 years with
two small children, I'm a college graduate and published writer. I have a
good reputation in the community and have been involved in many charitable
organizations.</p>

<p>My only crime was planting a handful of marijuana seeds.</p>

<p>When I was first arrested for growing pot last August, I freely admitted
my guilt, fully expecting to receive the relatively minor sentence usually
meted out in marijuana cases.  Until recently, marijuana use and cultivation
was decriminalized in many places, and even now it's only a misdemeanor in
most states (including my own).  It usually warrants nothing more than a
suspended sentence and a small fine when prosecuted at the state level.
Last year a man in Upstate <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a> was convicted
of growing 154 plants --
many more than I am charged with -- and his only punishment was a $100 fine --
less than a dollar a plant.</p>

<p>My penalty probably would have been similar - if I'd been tried in state
court.  But more and more, these cases are being turned over to the federal
government for prosecution, where penalties are much stiffer.  What would've
earned me, at most, a fine and probation in state court carries a mandatory
minimum sentence of five years (and a maximum of 40) when prosecuted at the
federal level.</p>

<p>It's all because of recently enacted mandatory minimum-sentencing laws.
They impose statutory minimums for all drug crimes and prohibit the judge
from any exercise of judicial discretion in arriving at a sentence.  The
judge is enjoined against taking into account things like my reputation in
the community, charitable works or lack of prior record.  Since there's no
such thing as parole in federal prison anymore, if I'm sentenced to five
years (assuming I lose my case), that's how many I'll serve.</p>

<p>Chalk it up to the government's "get tough on crime" policy: So what if
a few undeserving people serve inflated sentences? It's worth it to keep the
streets free from crime.  The problem is, rather on being tough on crime, the
net effect of mandatory minimums is to be soft on crime - violent crime.
Since the are no mandatory minimum sentences for offenses like rape, child
molestation, murder, aggravated assault, <i>et cetera</i>, violent
criminals are often released early to make room for nonviolent first
offenders like me.  The average murderer now serves only six and a half years
in jail (versus the five years minimum I'll serve).</p>

<p>But if our jail terms are similar, there's one important difference between
the murderer and me: He doesn't lose his house.</p>

<p>Even though my house was bought with legitimate earnings, and there was no
marijuana grown on my property, it was confiscated by the police shortly after
I was arrested.  The primary reason given was that fertilizer was found in my
basement.  My house was thus considered a "facilitator" of the crime, which
justifies its forfeiture.  When I learned that the government had seized my
property on such flimsy pretenses, it infuriated me, but what bothered me
even more was that they did it without even trying me first.</p>

<p>Since passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, property can
be seized if one is merely suspected of using it in a crime. It's not even
necessary to be charged, much less convicted.  It's up to the individual to
prove that he didn't use it illegally.  And since this is a civil forfeiture,
and public defenders are only provided in criminal cases, he's forced to foot
the bill for a lawyer.  Often he also must put up a bond, sometimes as much
as $10,000, which usually makes fighting the forfeiture cost-prohibitive.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases, the government simply steps in and takes the
property without even bothering to charge anyone with a crime, and there's not
a thing to be done about it.  Since 1984 almost two and a half billion dollars
in property has been seized this way.</p>

<p>There's another difference between the murderer and me.  He isn't subject
to penalties for tax-stamp violation.  Even though marijuana is illegal, in
many states you're required by law to buy tax stamps for its cultivation --
at a cost of $1,000 per plant - something that's virtually impossible to do
without incriminating yourself.  Yet even if you are somehow able to purchase
the stamps without getting arrested but don't actually affix the stamps to
the plants -- in the wind and rain -- you're still liable for a heavy fine.
And they don't just count the living, growing plants.  They count the dead
ones and even the cutoff stems from plants that were thinned from the garden
and thrown away earlier.</p>

<p>Even though the total weight of marijuana in my case was under five pounds,
with all these other factors added in, the fine was $340,000.</p>

<p>When I asked my lawyer how the government expected me to pay such an
astronomical fine, he said, "They don't.  They want to wipe out your assets.
Then when -- and if -- you get out of jail, they intend to garnish your wages
for the remainder.  Of course, by that time there'll be all that interest."</p>

<p>But the fine is just part of my penalty for tax-stamp violation.  It also
carries criminal (versus civil) penalties of up to five years in state prison.
That's on top of the five to 40 years I'll already be serving in federal
prison.  All for the crime of putting a handful of marijuana seeds in the
ground.</p>

<p>If this seems like a violation of the Eighth Amendment ("Let the punishment
fit the crime"), it's not the only time the Constitution's been ignored when
it comes to drug law.  Confiscation of property without due process is a
violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Police can now obtain search warrants
based on anonymous tips, which is a violation of the Fourth Amendment.  And
a defense attorney's legal fees can be seized in drug cases, a violation of
the Sixth Amendment.</p>

<p>But if drug laws are chipping away at the Constitution, they're wreaking
havoc on our prison system.  Federal prisons are currently at 146 percent of
capacity, and drug offenders serving mandatory minimum sentences make up 57
percent of the population (more than half had no prior arrests).  At the
current rate of incarceration, nearly 70 percent of all federal inmates 
will be drug offenders serving mandatory minimums by 1995.</p>

<p>The United States now imprisons more of its citizens per capita than any
other country in the world (455 per 100,000 people).  That's compared to
the No. 2 country, South Africa, with 311 per 100,000.  As stated earlier,
violent offenders often must be granted early release to make room for this
influx.  In a recent four-year period in Florida more than 130,000 inmates
(including muggers, armed robbers, <i>et cetera</i>) were released, and one
out of three went on to commit new crimes.  The F.B.I. reports that the
rate of violent crimes in America increased by 24 percent from 1987 to 1991,
and many people feel that mandatory minimums have a lot to do with it.</p>

<p>But apart from the hypothetical increase in violent crime due to mandatory
minimums, there's the undeniable increase in taxpayer costs.  The National
Institute of Corrections estimates that in 1992, the United States built
facilities for 2,000 cells (at a cost of $100 million) per week to accommodate
the exploding prison population -- and construction costs were only a part of 
the total.  It's been estimated that in five years, the financial obligations
incurred by U.S. corrections could be double the current national deficit.
On top of that, it costs on average over $20,000 a year to house, feed, 
clothe, and guard each of the 81,426 federal prisoners.</p>

<p>And this is to say nothing of the increased cost of social services of
inmates' families, which were previously being provided for by the inmates
themselves.  Over 30 million Americans regularly smoke marijuana, so it's
not surprising that a lot of people in this country feel that it should be
decriminalized.  I'm sure that many people would disagree, but I doubt 
they'd dispute the fact that the penalties for marijuana use are not only
unjust and illogical, but make an unconscionable waste of taxpayer dollars.
With violent crime making us all live like prisoners, it's time to 
stop freeing murders to make room for marijuana users.</p>
