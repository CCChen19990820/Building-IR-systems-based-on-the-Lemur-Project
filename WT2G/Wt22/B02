INTRODUCTION
<p>What is a contemporary private garden?</p>
<p>This question has been asked many times. We have asked it. Friends have posed it. Clients have asked for it to be designed.</p>
<p>The landscape architects and designers presented in this book have achieved it. This book is a survey of garden designs since about 1980 that signal what the private garden might be in the twenty-first century. The built and unbuilt projects here show the many and varied ways landscape architects and designers have responded to the multiplicity of cultural phenomena and contemporary realities of the last two decades, and hint at how they will respond in the coming years.</p>
<p>In these past twenty years, landscape architects, particularly in America, have asked ever more searching questions about the nature of the gardens they design-of whatever size-and how they can be integrated into the community and the local ecology. During this period, landscape architects have been able to experiment with extremely controversial ideas for corporate and municipal clients. Plazas, university campuses, corporate headquarters, and multidwelling developments have on occasion been surrounded by and integrated into landscapes that sometimes show amazing creativity and sometimes amazing arrogance, but are almost always made with minimal personal involvement. Neither the landscape architect nor the-chairman of the board nor the parks commissioner nor the developer has to live in the landscape which they have commissioned. (Nor do some leading architects of the modern or postmodern live in white walls and glass.)</p>
<p>Private gardens reveal the other end of the spectrum of contemporary landscape design. The executive may want to make a bold statement in the landscaping of his or her company's headquarters, suggesting that the leading edge of its design exemplifies the contemporary thrust of its corporate strategy, but individuals usually want the surrounding of their own homes to contain elements which give privacy, shade, serenity, and contentment. The designs in this book reveal approaches that can encompass both views, that of the contemporary and that of the domestic, in all their many interpretations. The one element unifying contemporary private garden design is diversity. It is diversity on many, many levels: it is diversity of geography (the gardens shown here are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, Japan, and Australia), and it is diversity of inspiration. Landscape architects and designers active today draw inspiration from modern art, from the work of Luis Barragan, Roberto Burle Marx, and Isamu Noguchi, from the formal garden, from the post- industrial age, from ecological concern, and from the primitive. </p>

In/Of Her Time:
Nan Goldin's Photographs
<p>ELISABETH SUSSMAN</p>
<p>NAN GOLDIN IS the impassioned historian of love in the age of fluid sexuality, glamour, beauty, violence, death, intoxication, and masquerade. An uncanny attention and attraction to the drama and the commonplace of life structure her photographs. In front of her camera, women weep in bars; couples make love on unmade beds in messy apartments; beautiful, naked male torsos lie atop cars; women stare into bathroom mirrors.</p>
<p>Given a camera as a teenager, Goldin at once began to record those around her-a simple enough gesture, but one that combined with a sense of history. As she continued to take pictures of her friends, she began to accumulate their histories, and history itself emerged as an imperative that would thenceforth govern her operation. By capturing the present, Goldin instinctively knew that the record would ultimately deliver a past. Out of the flux of experience, she captures moments that cumulatively tell stories of love, friendship, desire, and their aftermaths. Her camera freezes the comings and goings of the social experience of desire: love and hate in intimate relationships; moments of isolation, self-revelation, and adoration; the presentation of the sexual self freed from the constraints of biological destiny. Nor is Goldin's an abstract history. It is recounted through the lives of people who are part of her life, with whom she dances to the music of time.' In Goldin's work, the vastness of experience boils down to remembered incidents: the flux or duration of life can be captured in images of the days and nights of familiar people. Although an individual image may be devastating in its intensity and beauty, Goldin, like a novelist or filmmaker, thinks both of single images and of sequences of linked images that form a narrative.</p>
<p>As single images, Goldin's work can be seen as "social portraiture." In this sense, it relates to the work of August Sander, the great documentary photographer. Sander's photographs of different types- peasants, artists, aristocrats, artisans, civil servants, students, etc.-were published as Antlitz der Zeit (Face of Our Time), in 1929 in Weimar, Germany. The book was described at the time as "a kind of cultural history, even a sociology of the last thirty years." Goldin's project differs from that of Sander's, however, because the lives she records are those of her friends. The stories that she builds from single images, moreover, are not narrative in the literary sense. They are filmic, corresponding to Siegfried Kracauer's "cinematic story forms which assert themselves independently of the established literary genres...found stories" to be captured by the intuitive observer. Goldin's tales resist commentary or text. Their meaning emerges through the editing and sequencing of individual images and, in the case of her slide shows accompanied by music, through lyric and sound.</p>
<p>The history of desire that surfaces through sequenced images recording the life of a friend is exemplified in the trajectory of the photograph Cookie at Tin Pan Alley, NYC (I983, p. 261). The photograph shows the actress and writer Cookie Mueller seated at a table in a bar, a half-filled glass of beer in front of her, a cigarette burning in a nearby ashtray. Her eyes are cast down and her expression is somber. Goldin made this photograph during the production of Bette Gordon's film Variety, a story of a ticket taker in a Times Square sex theater who, crossing the line from voyeur to participant, pursues her own fantasies with one of the theater's customers. Goldin avoided Gordon's fictional narrative, but was sympathetic to its political assumptions: that the sex industry, in addition to exploiting its participants, furnishes women with income and can be a vehicle for women's fantasy.</p>
<p>Goldin integrated the film still into her own documentary sequences, shot in Tin Pan Alley, a Times Square-area bar. The bar served as a kind of streetwise academy in the early 1980s for a group that included Goldin, other artists, and its own regulars. In Cookie at Tin Pan Alley, Mueller is actually posed in front of a wall hung with the sculpture of John Ahearn, casts made from the figures of people Ahearn knew. Goldin took this photograph during the filming of Variety and inserted it into her first book, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (I986), ill a section titled "Wild Women Don't Get the Blues." Here four photographs-one of them Cookie at Tin Pan Alley-show four women alone, introspective, offering no gesture of ingratiation toward another person. The photograph reappeared in a I990 exhibition and 1991 publication devoted entirely to images of Cookie Mueller, who had died of AIDS in I989. Seen in this sequence, the photograph functions less as an element in the documentary topology of desire than as a fragment of a memorial to a specific woman, whose life epitomized her era and whose loss is of particular poignancy to her friend, the photographer. </p>

<p>In this work, the likeness of the man who has so much loved 'capturing' that of others will not be portrayed in pictures. This deliberate omission is aimed neither at enhancing the myth through the artifice of mystery, nor at depriving the reader of legitimate biographical curiosity. After all, did the inventiveness of the portrait of Isidore Ducasse tell us much about the poetry of the Comte de Lautreamont? Or does the silhouette of Henri Beyle exactly recapture the stature of the man we know as Stendhal? The identity of an artist is to be found in his work.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the thirties, photography became Henri Cartier Bresson's mistress and was to accompany him around the world. He was by then already living in defiance of the accepted codes of conduct. Born in 1908, the gods of wealth and happiness had smiled upon him in the cradle. He was soon, however, to show a preference for the Muses: Terpsichore (dance), Clio (history), Erato (Iyric poetry) and Urania (astronomy, represented compass in hand, mistress of the stars and of the hours). Later, with his sure aim, he was to take up the bow, the instrument of Apollo when he abandoned the Iyre, as well as of Ulysses, the wily traveller. 'The Judeo Christian world, the Muslim world, that's not what it's about... When I was a kid, I had a passion for Greek mythology and for paganism. One comes across these gods every day!" He was soon on the fringe of his milieu, unable to bear its conformism and fixed assumptions, notably in religious matters, on account of the image of the body that was preached by a Catholicism of restrictive and austere morals. He preferred to substitute the fruits of his own thinking: 'I have never had a faith, and I think that I had a bad first communion because I knew where children came from-I thought that one did not have the right to know this, at that time-and I had an idea of it that was entirely botanical. I knew that I would have two children, I tried to check if they would be two boys or two girls, and I said to myself: those poor men who have ten or twelve children, that must be a weighty burden. I thought that there was something like a pip that you put between the woman's legs... That was my idea of procreation!'</p>
<p>According to Claude Lefranc, who was with Cartier Bresson in captivity and when he escaped (he was to be a prisoner of war in Germany for three years), he considered the fact of belonging to a great dynasty of textile manufacturers, one of the two hundred most prominent French </p>

PREFACE
by Nicolas de Oliveira, Nicola Oxley and Michael Petry
<p>Installation, as a generic term, covers a large area of practice and enquiry within contemporary art. It is suggestive of the notion of 'exhibition', or 'display', and of an actual activity which is today as widespread as any other way of making art.</p>
<p>This book does not attempt to be all-inclusive, which would have been impossible given the very wide practice of installation. Nor does it seek to confine the subject by providing its ultimate definition. Rather it sets out a series of markers which outline the scale of its own task: to provide a focus on a highly complex practice.</p>
<p>Installation, as a hybrid discipline, is made up of multiple histories; it includes architecture and Performance Art in its parentage, and the many directions within contemporary visual arts have also exerted their influence. By crossing the frontiers between different disciplines, installation is able to question their individual autonomy, authority and, ultimately, their history and relevance to the contemporary context.</p>
<p>The prominence of installations in specific non-art sites also continues to figure among the concerns of installation artists. The activation of the place, or context, of artistic intervention suggests a localized, highly specific reading of the work, and is concerned not only with art and its boundaries, but with the continual rapprochement, or even fusion, of art and life. Installation must therefore also represent the artist's desire to extend the area of practice from the studio to the public space. By laying claim to territory beyond the private sphere, the artist is seen to widen the control that he/she has over the display of work.</p>
<p>Every book also contains a history of its own production, and Installation Art is no exception. It is underpinned by several years of research and extensive travel by the authors, and, necessarily, by a constant interaction with the practice. Discussions on the book began in 1989, at a time when the authors were responsible for the London-based Unit 7 Gallery, which was devoted to installation, and which, in turn, led to the establishment of the Museum of Installation.</p>
<p>We are indebted to Thames and Hudson for its support in bringing together this first book on the subject; to Michael Archer for his lucid texts; to Andrew Tullis for his research; to Edward Woodman for his archive of images, and to all those who have kindly lent photographic material, without whose help the book would not have been possible.</p>
<p>Because installation works may be created on one site and later recreated elsewhere, dates and titling can sometimes be variable. The same work, or a slightly altered work, may appear with different dates and titles. </p>

Did the citizens of Athens in the era of Pericles know that they were
living in a Golden Age? I certainly didn't know that I was growing up in
the Golden Age of American musicals, as I lived my teenage years in
New York City in the forties and my law-student days a decade later in
the "tryout city" of New Haven, Connecticut. Only now, after reading
this lively history of one of America's most popular art forms, do I
realize how remarkable an era it was.
<p>I may even have taken for granted the fact that each season brought to Broadway a range of hits such as Oklahoma!, South Pacific, Kiss Me, Kate, and Guys and Dolls, and the stage power of the likes of Mary Martin and Ethel Mermall. It all seemed natural and inevitable, that energy and talent. Even the availability of cheap seats to see world-class shows seemed part of the natural order of things.</p>
<p>When I was a student at Yale Law in New Haven, I had the chance to see musicals that are now classics, even before they reached Broadway. But I must admit my judgement was not always the best. I remember passing up one show because I didn't like its premise. Who wanted to see that wonderful story Pygmalion ruined? By the time it reached Broadway I had come to my senses. But by then I had to pay a fortune to see My Fair Lady.</p>
<p>I went to see it the night before my bar exam. That was the best thing I ever did.</p>
<p>Everyone who picks up this book will have their own memories of the great musicals of Broadway and Hollywood. The authors, Amy Henderson and Dwight Blocker Bowers, have done us all a favor by convening once again the great talents of stage and screen who wrote the music and penned the words, who staged and choreographed the productions, and who gave voice and presence to emotion and drama and impossible grace.</p>
<p>They have focused on the individuals who arose out of what they call our "commotion of cultures" to create a form that owes something to the operettas of Europe but which has been transformed by the rhythms of our national life. There are echoes of all of our origins here, the mix and match of who we are and what we have formed together.</p>
<p>It's time that the Smithsonian put the spotlight on this energetic tradition and a nice coincidence that we do it in our 1 50th anniversary year. It took two of our great museums, the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum of American History, to make it happen, and I congratulate them for the success of their collaboration. It is a gift to all of us. </p>

IMAGINE THE CONSEQUENCES of a parachute that doesn't deploy
or deploys only half way, a balloon that suddenly deflates, a glider
caught in a violent downdraft, or a sky surfer spinning out of control.
Air offers little resistance, so it can't keep the forces of gravity from
drawing our bodies to the earth's surface.  Only the drag created as
objects pass through the air limits the speeds at which they travel down
to earth.  Another useful fact about the air that covers our planet is that
it varies in temperature.  Warm air rises until it cools in the upper
atmosphere, and then it travels downward once again to the earth's
surface. Here, it is warmed again, and the cycle is complete.  The air is
much like an ocean, with its ever flowing tides and currents.  Because
the elements that make up the air are lighter than the ocean and the
land, the air knows no borders. When it pushes up against land or sea, it
simply follows the path of least resistance and moves on to pursue its
intended direction.  Understanding how air travels as it crosses the
planet is of paramount importance to the creation and growth of
extreme air sports.
<p>TO FLY LIKE A BIRD</p>
<p>We have discovered a number of ways to defy gravity in the air. First we used vines and cords. Then we made balloons, parachutes, and wings, and using these to channel the air to create lift or sufficient drag to control the speed at which we fall to earth, we created sports that our ancestors could only dream about. Legendary Icarus was said to be the first to test the limits of flight only to perish in his famous tumble to earth after flying too close to the sun. Leonardo Da Vinci drafted many sketches after envisioning craft capable of flight, from the balloon to the helicopter. a few short decades ago, many of the techniques currently used to test the air could have only been imagined in the pages of Flash Gordon or a Jules Verne novel.</p>
<p>The thrill of flying like a bird, hurtling to earth at high speed only to float to a stop, is what has drawn athletes to push the limits of what is possible in the air. One can only imagine that early balloonists would have considered it insanity if anyone had suggested jumping from their craft attached to an elastic cord or a parachute. Of course, these pioneers of aviation were then considered to be the crazy risk takers for pursuing flight. They were the early extreme air sports enthusiasts. In time, they were forced to create vehicles, namely parachutes, that could allow them to escape their balloons with their lives if the worst were to occur. Soon items of necessity became ones of play, and the limits of air were again redefined. </p>

The Atlas of Literature
General Editor
Malcolm Bradbury
<p><ul> "Nearly all literature, in one sense, is made up of guide-books." (Herman Melville)</ul></p>
<p>The Atlas of Literature explores the fascinating connection between writers and place. This ambitious and exciting book focuses on writers and works that are intimately bound up with a place and a time, capturing a town, a city, a region, in its literary heyday.</p>
<p>Through more than 80 essays, the Atlas looks at scores of cities, regions and countries all over the world that have been immortalized in literature or through their association with writers who lived there. Here are Stratford and London in Shakespeare's day, Cervantes' Spain, the world of the Lake poets, the Brontes' Yorkshire, Dickens's London, Balzac's Paris, Hardy's Wessex, Kafka's Prague, Joyce's Dublin, Paris in the Twenties, Bloomsbury, Hollywood, Broadway and many, many others through to the present day.</p>
<p>The maps are a major feature of the book, locating key towns and cities, plotting real and fictional journeys and landscapes, and showing the cafes, theatres and homes where legendary authors lived, worked and congregated. These are supplemented by copious period drawings, photographs and illustrations of hundreds of people and places.</p>
<p>Written in a vivid, approachable style by an international team of literary biographers, novelists and scholars under the general editorship of Malcolm Bradbury, who has himself contributed many of the essays in the book, The Atlas of Literature is a marvellously entertaining companion for the general reader and an important and invaluable work of background and reference for the student of literature. </p>

<h2>P<font size=-1>ARADISE T</font><font size=-1>RANSFORMED</font>.<br></h2>

The last two decades have seen a great explosion in the diversity,
function, and beauty of modern landscape architecture. Private
commissions have been the testing ground for the most radical
experimentation. This first major survey of contemporary private
gardens explores the imaginative ideas behind landscape design today.
Almost fifty projects from more than twenty-five landscape architects
worldwide are thoroughly documented here.
<p>Each of the four sections of the book-Exploration, Innovation, Tradition, Abstraction-reveals a distinct and original approach to the landscape. Acknowledged masters like Dan Kiley, lan Hamilton Finlay, and Jacques Wirtz stand next to today's most influential landscape architects-Martha Schwartz, Fernando ¥ Caruncho, Vladimir Sitta-as well as such young talents as Chip Sullivan and Dean Cardasis. The featured work in this volume is located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Spain, Germany, Belgium, and Australia.</p>
<p>Diversity characterizes each designer's work. The modernist aesthetic, translated from art and architecture-especially the strains of cubism, the International Style, post-modernism, minimalism, and Earth Art gives form to a great number of the landscapes presented. Many designs have been equally influenced by the legacy of Luis Barragan, Isamu Noguchi, and Roberto Burle Marx. A consideration of the physical and social contexts is also evident in the designers' concern for the environment. The remarkable blend of projects in this volume captures contemporary landscape architecture at the moment when it signals what is to come in the twenty-first century. </p>

"NAN'S MANHATTAN life organized itself early on along the
principles of a collective, and the climate of her work has always been
that of generous collaboration."
DARRYL PINCKNEY
"HE TAKES photographs, and what her subjects get back in return
are vivid, compassionate, and honest pictures of themselves,
photographs that confer enfranchisement, and with that, power."
MARVIN HEIFERMAN
"AN IS A PORTRAITIST of souls.  She looks through the
eyes of her subjects, in both directions, and her purview additionally
takes in friends, lovers, artefacts, clothing, rooms: the soul's context. She
sees herself in her subjects; the doors between her life and her work are
kept wide open."
LUC SANTE
"THE FOCUS OF Nan Goldin's work is the human body, fragile
yet strong, tiny yet full of presence, surrounded by affection, love, and
destructive tendencies."
JOACHIM SARTORIUS
"NAN GOLDIN IS the impassioned historian of love in the age of
fluid sexuality, glamour, beauty, violence, death, intoxication, and
masquerade.  An uncanny attention and attraction to the drama and the
commonplace of life structure her photographs."

HENRI CARTIER - BRESSON
<p>AND THE ARTLESS ART</p>
<p>JEAN - PIERRE MONTIER</p>
<p>Henri Cartier-Bresson is perhaps the greatest photographer of the twentieth century. In a career spanning over sixty years, he has used his camera as an impassive and neutral third eye to capture the vagaries of human behaviour and to produce some of the most memorable and compelling photographs ever published.</p>
<p>In this impressive biographical study, Jean-Pierre Montier traces Cartier-Bresson's artistic progression from his early training as a painter and draughtsman right up to the present; he provides a detailed analysis of his most famous images and discusses the various philosophies that inform his work, notably Zen and Surrealism. Drawing together a remarkable selection of the paintings, sketches, and photographs, this book is the first to attempt a serious evaluation, not just of Cartier-Bresson's photojournalism, but of his oeuvre as a whole. </p>

A SMITHSONIAN SALUTE TO THE AMERICAN MUSICAL
<p>AMY HENDERSON AND DWIGHT BOWERS</p>
<p>Fred and Ginger gliding cheek-to-cheek across an Art Deco stage . . . Shirley Temple stair-dancing with Bill "Bojangles" Robinson . . . Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney putting on a show . . . Gene Kelly romping in the rain . . .</p>
<p>Lavishly illustrated, Red, Hot 6 Blue showcases the Hollywood and Broadway musical from its immigrant roots in nineteenth-century vaudeville, through its heyday on both the "Great White Way" and the silver screen, to its retrospective role today in such revivals as Show Boat. Its title taken from Cole Porter's 1936 musical, the book spotlights the performers, composers, lyricists, impresarios, choreographers, designers, and directors who collectively reinvented American culture through this most extravagant of twentieth-century art forms.</p>
<p>Chronicling the "fine romance" between the audience and its musical icons, the authors portray the personalities who pushed boundaries of style and content to create an increasingly sophisticated melange of story, song, and dance. They show, too, how musicals have evoked two deeply ingrained national impulses: one, a nostalgia for a gentler, rural past, as seen in Oklahoma!, Meet me in St. Louis, and The Music Man; the other an energetic embrace of the urban landscape, as expressed in On the Town, Guys and Dolls, and West Side Story </p>

<h2>What the world is reading</h2><ul></ul>

<p>THE reading habits of Britain and the three countries that provided the bedrock of the old "white Commonwealth" diverge widely, at least when it comes to factual books. On fiction bestseller lists, thrillers written by the likes of Tom Clancy, Jeffrey Archer, John Grisham, Stephen King and Frederick Forsyth are as popular in Britain as they are in Australia, Canada and South Africa. But only a single book appears on more than one of these four non-fiction lists: "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Australian list is the least demanding. It is headed by a diet manual and contains no fewer than three books about sport. The life of Paul Keating, the leader of the Labor government which lost power earlier this year, sticks out as a heavyweight tome. The biographer, John Edwards, served as Mr Keating's economic adviser on two separate occasions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Only one of the South African bestsellers, Nelson Mandela's autobiography, is written by a black African. Business figures prominently in a list headed by an account of the shenanigans at Amalgamated Banks of Southern Africa by a former <font size=-1>ABSA</font> executive. The other business bestsellers, in third and eighth place, have a more positive message.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a country that frets constantly about being dominated by the elephant next door, the Canadian list has a surprisingly muted American twang. The top seller has caught the national imagination in claiming that population studies explain two-thirds of everything that happens. David Foot, an economist turned demographer, predicts that population changes will boost demand for bird-watchers' binoculars, holiday cruises and symphony concerts, all of which appeal to older people.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British list is the most domestic of the four. Antonio Carluccio's is the only entrant with a foreign accent. "Longitude" is the sleeper: a history of 18th-century navigational history that has proved an astonishing success. Before-and-after pictures of Nigel Lawson, a former chancellor of the exchequer, have persuaded many Britons that it is much better to be tubby than gaunt.<p><br><h3>Bestsellers, non fiction</h3><ul><li><a href="#1">Australia</a><li><a href="#2">Britain</a><li><a href="#3">Canada</a><li><a href="#4">South Africa</a></ul></td></tr></table><a name="1"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4> Australia </h4><ol><li>	Liver Cleansing Diet	<i> 	by Sandra Cabot	</i>. &#160; 	Popular with vegans	</li><li>	Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus	<i> 	by John Gray	</i>. &#160; 	Relationships	</li><li>	Chip off the Old Block	<i> 	by Max Walker	</i>. &#160; 	A former Test cricketer writes	</li><li>	100 Years of Australian Football	<i> 	by John Ross	</i>. &#160; 	Kick by kick, blow by blow	</li><li>	Keating 	<i> 	by John Edwards	</i>. &#160; 	Biography of yesterday's prime minister	</li><li>	Seven Spiritual Laws of Success	<i> 	by Deepak Chopra	</i>. &#160; 	Serving body and soul	</li><li>	Edward de Bono's Mind Pack	<i> 	by Edward de Bono	</i>. &#160; 	More lateral thoughts	</li><li>	Ablett	<i> 	by Gary Ablett	</i>. &#160; 	The Australian Gazza writes	</li><li>	Man Maintenance	<i> 	by Jill Margo	</i>. &#160; 	From penis amputation to Mondayitis	</li><li>	Generation F	<i> 	by Virginia Trioli	</i>. &#160; 	Defender of the modern Ms	</li></ol></td></tr></table><a name="2"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4> Britain </h3><ol>				<li>	Longitude	<i> 	by Dava Sobel	</i>. &#160; 	John Harrison, navigation's longitude problem-solver	</li><li>	The Guinness Book of Records 1997	<i> 		</i>. &#160; 	Record-breaking 41st edition	</li><li>	Chequers: The House and its History	<i> 	by Norma Major	</i>. &#160; 	John's wife on their country pad	</li><li>	The Friendship Book of Francis Gay 1997	<i> 		</i>. &#160; 	Annual compendium of prose and poems	</li><li>	Flora Britannica	<i> 	by Richard Mabey	</i>. &#160; 	Encyclopedia of Britain's wild plants	</li><li>	Antonio Carluccio's Italian Feast	<i> 	by Antonio Carluccio	</i>. &#160; 	Pasta-full Italian TV cook's recipes	</li><li>	The Nigel Lawson Diet Book	<i> 	by Nigel Lawson	</i>. &#160; 	Fat cat thins	</li><li>	The Man who Listens to Horses	<i> 	by Monty Roberts	</i>. &#160; 	Breaking in horses gently	</li><li>	Dalglish: My Autobiography	<i> 	by Kenny Dalglish and Henry Winter	</i>. &#160; 	Life story of soccer luminary	</li><li>	My Name Escapes Me	<i> 	by Alec Guinness	</i>. &#160; 	An octogenarian actor's diary	</li></td></tr></table><a name="3"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4> Canada </a></h3><ol>				<li>	Boom, Bust & Echo	<i> 	by David K.

<p><b>Doing business abroad</b></p>
<h2>Another story</h2><ul> <li><a href="10ex313.html">W<font size=-1>HEN</font> C<font size=-1>ULTURES</font> C<font size=-1>OLLIDE</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Richard Lewis.<br>
</ul>



<p>SUPPOSE you are a businessman in Britain for the first time and anxious to do well. Just how do these mysterious Brits conduct business negotiations? Turn to this book. In Britain, answers Mr Lewis, it is advisable to arrive at a business meeting "well stocked with jokes and anecdotes". Match story with story and "an atmosphere conducive to doing business will result".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clear enough. But what if you are German? Mr Lewis warns readers that Germans do not like jokes in business discussions, and that their own stories, even told afterwards over a beer, are unfunny. This is dispiriting for someone who, back home, is the life and soul of the beer-hall. The German is glad that at least he is is not a Japanese businessman, who, Mr Lewis says, would not even understand an amusing reference--though, being polite, would smile if aware that a witticism had been aired.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the German should serve his business apprenticeship in some country less bothersome than Britain; Finland for example. Finns do not say much--it is something to do with the cold--so there is no need to remember a lot of funny stories. They do have some odd habits, such as never taking a bath after ten at night, but the trains run on time and there are no hurricanes. One place the apprentice businessman should definitely avoid is Spain. Very touchy, the Spaniards. "You must work hard at making a Spaniard like you," says Mr Lewis, worryingly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It may, therefore, seem a puzzle that there is much international trade at all. Nevertheless, the chatty British with their irritating habit of telling stories do a huge amount of business with the morose Germans, the humourless Japanese and even the Trappist-like Finns. The answer may be that the salesmen circling the world who keep industry in work are not that bothered about cultural nuances, but believe, or give a great impression of believing, that their product is special, marvellous, indispensable, fantastic value and the only one of its type available, anywhere. It often seems to work. That's the funny thing.

DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, DIFFERENT WORLDS
<p><ul> For a German and a Finn, the truth is the truth. In Japan and Britain it is all right if it doesn't rock the boat. In China there is no absolute truth. In Italy it is negotiable.</ul></p>
<p>COMPARISONS OF NATIONAL CULTURES OFTEN BEGIN BY HIGHLIGHTING differences in social behaviour. Japanese do not like shaking hands, bow when greeting each other and do not blow their nose in public. Brazilians form unruly bus queues, prefer brown shoes to black and arrive two hours late at cocktail parties. Greeks stare you in the eye, nod their head when they mean 'no', and occasionally smash plates against walls in restaurants. French people wipe their plate clean with a piece of bread, throw pastry into their coffee and offer handshakes to strangers in bistros. Brits tip their soup plate away from them, eat peas with their fork upside down and play golf in the rain.</p>
<p>Appearance and reality</p>
<p>These various manners and mannerisms cause us great amusement. We smile at foreign eccentricity, congratulating ourselves on our normality. And yet we are aware that these idiosyncrasies are largely superficial. If we stay in France a while we are sooner or later happy to dunk our croissant and make a mess; we discover the unhurried delight of turning up outrageously late in Brazil; we throw vodka glasses over our shoulder with abandon in St Petersburg. Such adaptation of our behaviour leaves no scar on our psyche. We join strangers in their little ways partly to conform and partly for fun. Our appearance is not our reality. We can become French or Greek for an evening, a party or a dinner, we can sit on tatami with Japanese and eat legs of lamb with one hand among Arabs. But what goes on in our head remains a private, well-protected constant. We may put on a show for others, but all the while we follow our own silent programme. </p>

The successful managers of the twenty-first century will be the culturally
sensitive ones. If you are in a business meeting, in negotiations, part of a joint
venture or just face-to-face with someone from another culture, you gain a
competitive advantage from having strategies to deal with the cultural
differences you will encounter.
<p>- Germans believe that the truth, even if unpalatable, will achieve a successful outcome. The English give priority to not rocking the boat. But to the Chinese, there is no absolute truth.</p>
<p>- The Americans call the Japanese unethical if they break the contract. The Japanese say it is unethical for the Americans to apply the terms o f the contract if things have changed.</p>
<p>- In countries such as the US, Peru and Kuwait, conversation is a two-way process, where one partner takes up where the other leaves off. In Finland and Japan, silence is an integral part of social interaction, and lulls in conversation are regarded as restful, friendly and appropriate.</p>
<p>Richard Lewis provides a truly global and practical guide to working and communicating across cultures, explaining how our own culture and language affect the ways in which we organise our world, think, feel and respond, before going on to suggest both general and specific ways of making our influence felt across the cultural divide.</p>
<p>There are penetrating insights into how different business cultures accord status, structure their organisations and view the role of leader, alongside invaluable advice on global negotiation, sales and marketing. The book ranges from differences in etiquette and body language to new thinking in the areas of international management and team-building in Europe and the USA, as well as covering challenging new geographical ground in Russia, China and the Far East.</p>
<p>By focusing on the cultural roots of national behaviour, both in society and business, we can foresee and calculate with a surprising degree of accuracy how others will react and respond to us. Lewis adds the often overlooked dimension of language - for example, how Japanese often react in a certain way because they are thinking in Japanese.</p>
<p>A greater understanding of what makes other people tick will enable managers to ensure that their policies and activities exploit cultural synergies and make the right appeal to their chosen market. </p>

<p><b>Japanese literature</b></p>
<h2>Blossoms</h2><ul> <li><a href="11ex332.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> B<font size=-1>LUE-</font>E<font size=-1>YED</font> T<font size=-1>AROKAJA</font>.</a>&nbsp;  Donald Keene. <br>
</ul>

<p>JAPANESE literature has a long and distinguished history, but the choice of subjects considered acceptable in polite poetic circles has for most of the past 1,400 years been tightly circumscribed.
<ul><font size=-1>Novelty as such was disliked...until the end of the 19th century. There are countless poems on, say, cherry blossoms or reddening autumn leaves, but extremely few poems on peach blossoms or on withered leaves coated with ice. At poem competitions...judges would give bad marks to anyone with the bad taste to write about a plant or flower that was not approved...the imperial poetic anthologies were likely to exclude any poem that contained an ugly--that is, untraditional--word.</font></ul>
Donald Keene, the veteran scholar of all things Japanese who wrote the lines above, knows no such limits. This delightful new anthology of his work (a <i>tarokaja</i> is a stock comic character in Japanese medieval farces) contains musings and observations on topics as varied as <i>haiku</i> and the eating of human liver. Some of his earliest experiences of Japan were brutal. He learnt the language during the Pacific war, in order to translate Japanese naval signals. When the war was over, he was sent to interrogate suspected war criminals. In one passage, he describes his horror at discovering that a number of the prisoners he has befriended are accused of having Chinese captives bayoneted to death so that they could eat their livers, which were thought to be a powerful medicine.
<ul><font size=-1>My amiable hosts of a late afternoon were cannibals, cannibals who were proud of their gentlemanly traditions, cannibals who expressed profound shock when they heard that some Chinese...soldier had stolen a Japanese gentleman's coat.</font></ul>
Such experiences did not cause the young Mr Keene to write off the entire Japanese nation, as some soldiers did. Rather, the mutual hatred between his country and Japan made him search desperately for evidence of common humanity. In one moving vignette, he recalls the time he treated a group of Japanese <font size=-1>POW</font>s to a concert in a damp cement and concrete shower room. At the sound of familiar Japanese ballads, his prisoners started to weep. When Mr Keene played Beethoven's Eroica symphony, they listened in motionless awe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the post-war years, everything changed. Japanese socks and women grew stronger. Mr Keene's love for everything Japanese was no longer frowned upon by his compatriots. His outpouring of travel writing, literary criticism and cultural observations became required reading for anyone who wanted to understand a little better what makes Japanese culture so fascinating. His account of a visit to Ise is wonderful. The town is home to the holiest of Shinto shrines, which is knocked down and rebuilt to exactly the same design every 20 years, to symbolise the eternal cycle of death and rebirth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Donald Keene's prose oscillates between the sublime and the so-so, but for the warmth and energy behind his writing the reader can feel nothing but admiration.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Concerning Myself
<p><ul> This was one of a series of essays I wrote for the Japanese edition of the Reader's Digest over a period of about three years in the early 1980s. Later, many of these essays were collected in two books that sold surprisingly well.</ul></p>
<p>People find it strange that I have devoted my life to the study of Japan. When I meet someone for the first time I brace myself for the question, "Whatever made you study Japanese?" This question comes not only from Americans and Europeans, for whom Japan is a distant and mysterious country, but from Japanese, even those aware of the richness of their country's culture. I wonder why it should seem so strange that I (or anyone else) study so important a literature and history.</p>
<p>But the fact that the same question is asked again and again is evidence that the decision I made many years ago to devote myself to this study is still not accepted as normal behavior. No one expresses surprise when a person chooses to become a doctor or an engineer or, for that matter, a scholar of English literature, but Japan (even to Japanese) seems so special a country that it is not expected that any foreigner will study its civilization.</p>
<p>As a child nothing in my surroundings made me think of Japan. My favorite book, A Child's History of the World, had not one thing to say about Japan, at least as far as I can remember, but I was so infatuated with Europe that I did not even notice that Japan was missing. True, the children's encyclopedia I was given when I was nine or ten included among its three supplementary volumes one devoted to Japan, but I have only vague recollections of the Japan volumes--little poems called heiku, pictures of ladies with umbrellas held over one shoulder standing on hump-backed bridges. My absorption with France (the subject of another volume) was so pervasive that I seldom looked at the other two volumes. Perhaps this love of France was occasioned by nothing more profound than the picture of ladies and gentlemen in seventeenth-century costumes dancing on the bridge at Avignon.</p>
<p>The first Japanese I ever met was a girl, my classmate at junior high school. I doubt that I ever exchanged even a word with her because the boys at that school, as part of its unwritten traditions, never talked to the girls. </p>

Donald Keene, the preeminent Western authority on Japanese literature, presents here a fresh and
personal insight into his prolific career as writer and translator, traveler and social observer. This
enchanting collection of personal essays and literary vignettes, based on a lifetime of observation on
things Japanese, includes many short works available for the first time in English.
<p>In The Blue-Eyed Tarokaja J. Thomas Rime has compiled an abundance of reflections by Keene on the culture of the Japanese and on the cultural interaction between West and East. Keene writes on Japanese cuisine, music, and language; on people and places in Japan; and on Americans who study the country. In addition to a group of critical mediation on Japanese literature, he presents an absorbing exploration of Japanese translations of Western literature over the years. Several essays describe in detail Keene's attraction to Japan and how it feels to live as a perpetual commuter between two countries.</p>
<p>This enlightening, beautifully written anthology also includes some of Keene's earliest essays, many of them personal reflections culled from his years in the Pacific during World War II. Here are Keene's moving memoirs of his first teacher of Japanese, a man who served as inspiration throughout his life; of the dark secrets he learned as an interrogator of Japanese war criminals; of his interview with a Japanese assassin; and of the time he played a recording of Beethoven's Eroica Symphony to a group of Japanese prisoners.</p>
<p>An interview by Keen with Abe Kobo, compassionate elegies to beloved Japanese novelists Mishima Yukio and Kawabat Yasunari, and several previously unpublished translations round out this superb collection. With honesty, clarity, and grace, The Blue-Eyed Tarokaja is a treasury of insights on Japan for American readers. </p>

<p><b>Unread classics</b></p>
<h2>What the world isn't reading</h2><ul> <li>M<font size=-1>ODERN</font> E<font size=-1>PIC</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Franco Moretti.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Verso; 256 pages; &#163;45 and $65 (&#163;14 and $20 paperback)</i> <br>
</ul>

<p>THE learned jazz critic of <i>Le Monde</i>, Francis Marmande, who is also a university teacher, has a marvellous story about examining a clever doctoral student in literature. Among the many books she cited during a brilliant exposition was one of those daunting, Alpine works of 20th-century German philosophy, by Heidegger perhaps or Gadamer. The author does not really matter. Sensing that her familiarity with the great work was less than total, Mr Marmande asked her mildly if she had actually read it. Hardly pausing, she answered with a scornful frown: "Not personally".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How many 20th-century literary peaks have you scaled, "not personally"? There are so many routes to the summit: films, radio plays, abridgements, book reviews and book-chat shows, not to mention fine editions, to buy and display, in the hope perhaps that a bit of their edifying greatness will somehow rub off without strain, from a random dip, for example, or a quick check on a half-remembered first line.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Publishers evidently think there is a market for such literary talismans. France has Gallimard's beautiful <i>Pl&eacute;iade</i> editions on reassuringly durable bible-paper, America the sturdy, well-edited Library of America; Britain's Everyman Library has begun a series of contemporary classics and countless German publishers put out well-bound complete editions of the modern giants. In New York Alfred Knopf has just brought out a handsome two-volume boxed set of Robert Musil's "The Man Without Qualities", first published in German in 1930. This novel stands, says the blurb, alongside Marcel Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past" and James Joyce's "Ulysses" as one of "the three literary masterpieces of our century".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is shrewd marketing. The number three, for a start, is nicely judged. You could easily think of six, eight, ten or twenty candidate-masterworks, but three has the right hieratic ring. The choice of books is clever, too. When Joseph Collins reviewed "Ulysses" enthusiastically for the <i>New York Times</i> in 1922, he ventured a prophecy: "Not ten men or women out of a hundred can read "Ulysses" through...and five will do it as a <i>tour de force</i>."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Franco Moretti, a professor of literature at Columbia University, would be surprised by none of this. He has even invented a new term, "modern epic", for these unread monsters and written a witty literary analysis to explain their origins. Moderns epics, he writes, are "world texts", whose force and repute radiate far beyond their language or culture of origin. He considers Goethe's "Faust", Melville's "Moby Dick" as well as Proust, Musil and Joyce, and comes to a startling conclusion: it is in the nature of modern epic to be "very long and very boring".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Does that mean they can be safely forgotten about and that everyone can go back, with relief, to Milton, Tasso and Homer? Not quite. As voices of their time, modern epics are still "obligatory for any educated person". And, having sharpened these pincers, Mr Moretti then squeezes them tight: the more truly these classics reflect modern sensibilities, the more surely they will be open-ended, baggy, digressive and even pointless--brave qualities in their way, but not virtues anyone ever said made for "a good read".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A playful and brilliant writer, Mr Moretti is better at throwing out ideas than defending them against obvious objections. Are modern epics rare or common? Mr Moretti seems unsure. Must they be incomplete? Most of his book is about "Faust" and "Ulysses", which do find their end. Many ancient epics--the "Odyssey", for example--are wandering and discursive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There may, though, be peculiarly modern ways of not coming to the point. An endless story does not have to be long. In Kafka's "Castle", a shortish book, readers never find out whether or not the initialised anti-hero, K, gets to the castle. If they persevere to the end of the published text, they discover that Kafka does not get to the end of his book either. It just breaks off at the end of a sentence, as if the writer

THE question is whether Hindley Earnshaw, master of Wuthering Heights, drank himself to death in a night at the age of 27, as Heathcliff said he did; or whether Heathcliff, the villain of the piece in every other respect, helped him on his way. The short answer is (of course) that John Sutherland does not know because Emily Bront&#235; did not say.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But as an editor and annotator of 19th-century novels, Mr Sutherland, a professor of English at London University, sees there is fun to be had in raising the question, and in probing lacunae and inconsistencies in three dozen more classics from "Mansfield Park" to "Kim". The spirit of the enterprise is briskly practical, the tone chatty, the essays brief. The word "deconstruction" occurs only once. This is criticism for readers who, like Mr Sutherland, "have always thought 'how many children had Lady Macbeth?' a perfectly good question".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of the forays amount to little more than footnotes. Why might Charles Dickens have interpolated a redundant dream sequence into "Oliver Twist", with the villains Monks and Fagin haunting Oliver as he rests in a country village? Perhaps, thinks Mr Sutherland, because Dickens commissioned his illustrations in advance, and, having guessed wrongly the direction in which his story was heading, wrenched it round to accommodate the plates coming back from George Cruikshank.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chronological puzzles abound. Dickens's looseness with dates and seasons, particularly in "Martin Chuzzlewit", is forgiven: it reflects a "Shakespearian confidence in making the elements do whatever...the dramatic needs of his narrative require." Jane Austen's mingling of different seasonal motifs during the Box Hill picnic scene in "Emma" is a "miniature montage of the turning seasons", signalling that secular matters are being resolved. Wilkie Collins, by contrast, having made precise chronology a moving principle of "The Woman in White", is exposed as horribly embarrassed by a misplaced fortnight in volume three. Distribution of the book was halted and dates were juggled to bring the plot back into sequence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of the "puzzles" teased out here are ones set deliberately by their authors. The ill-defined hinterland of Melmotte, the swindler in Trollope's "The Way We Live Now", supplies much of the force of his character. In "Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" Robert Louis Stephenson could have managed a detailed physical description of the latter, had he not preferred to leave it to the reader's imagination. The ambiguous ending of Charlotte Bront&#235;'s "Villette", in which the heroine's fianc&#233; may or may not drown, was a means of avoiding the happy ending that readers--including Miss Bront&#235;'s father--were demanding.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A chapter on "Mansfield Park" is the least satisfying, being more about Edward Said's treatment of it in "Culture and Imperialism". Mr Said's argument is not easily contested on the terrain of Jane Austen alone and Mr Sutherland finds himself arguing two incongruent things at once: that the textual evidence is too slight to support Mr Said's emphasis on the slave trade as the novel's foundation; and that the central character of "Mansfield Park", Fanny Price, should be placed among the abolitionists of slavery not its profiteers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may not be the sort of criticism that reveals new depths to genius, but it is a stimulating discussion that risks giving pedantry a good name.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Jane Austen - Mansfield Park
<p>Where does Sir Thomas's wealth come from ?</p>
<p>Edward Said's book Culture and Imperialism was well received in the United States, but provoked some bad tempered responses in the United Kingdom (notably in the TLS). The reason for the bad temper, one might suspect, was that as the imperial power principally targeted in his book's historical discussions there remained a legacy of colonists' guilt in Britain. Particular exception was taken by British commentators to Said's chapter 'Jane Austen and Empire', and its triumphant conclusion: Yes, Austen belonged to a slave- owning society' (p. 115). The central piece of evidence for a meaningful conjunction between the author of Mansfield Park and black men sweating under some sadistic overseer's whip is Sir Thomas Bertram's absence for the early stages of the novel in his estate in Antigua, during which period his unsupervised offspring put on a domestic production of Kotzebue's scandalous (for the time) play, Lovers' Views. Fanny Price, the waif who has been brought as a penniless young dependant to Mansfield Park, strenuously declines to participate in this godless activity. After various trials of her goodness she eventually wins the heart of the second son (and, given his elder brother's ruined health, prospective heir to the estate) Edmund, correcting in the process his wayward sense of vocation. (Edmund's 'ordination' as a clergyman was given by Austen in a cryptic remark in a letter as her novel's principal subject- matter, although there is critical dispute about just what she meant; see p. xv). Finally, after a symbolic rejection of her sordid family home at Portsmouth, Fanny is adopted by Sir Thomas as the presiding spirit of Mansfield Park. Said sees her apotheosis as an installation of world-historical significance:</p>
<p>Like many other novels, Mansfield Park is very precisely about a series of both small and large dislocations and relocations in space that occur before, at the end of the novel, Fanny Price becomes the spiritual mistress of Mansfield Park. And that place itself is located by Austen at the centre of an arc of interests and concerns spanning the hemisphere, two major seas, and four continents. (p.112) </p>

Readers of Victorian fiction must often have tripped up on seeming anomalies,
enigmas, and mysteries in their favourite novels. Does Becky kill Jos at the end
of Vanity Fair? Why does no one notice that Hetty is pregnant in Adam Bede?
How, exactly, does Victor Frankenstein make his monster? In Is Heathcliff a
Murderer? (well, is he?) John Sutherland investigates thirty-four conundrums
of nineteenth-century fiction. Applying these 'real world' questions to fiction is
not in any sense intended to catch out the novelists who are invariably cleverer
than their most detectively inclined readers. Typically, one finds a reason for
the seeming anomaly. Not blunders, that is, but unexpected felicities and
ingenious justifications.

<h2>What the world is reading</h2><ul></ul> <p> NOVEL readers in America this
month appear to be a broody lot. Three of the bestsellers are to do with
childhood in one form or another: a three-year-old child vanishes, an Ohio boy
runs amok, embryos are genetically manipulated. The rest of the American list
attests to the bankable appeal of spy thrillers and political fiction (three of
ten entries) and to nicely calibrated moods of nostalgia, for the "turbulent"
1960s (late middle-aged readers?) and the second world war (over-75s?).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Earlier in the year, French novel readers were
also taken up with childhood. Now they seem to be more preoccupied with underdogs
or outsiders. Is this a sign of a reawakened social conscience? Top of the French
list is Marie Darrieussecq's satire about a shop girl turned pig who befriends
(and advises) a president. Other bestselling novels involve a peasant family, a
poor girl with a rich protector, a fashionable Paris madame and a young African
woman in Paris. This last book, "Les Honneurs Perdus", has won extra publicity
after charges of plagiarism from the novel that won Ben Okri, a London author,
the 1991 Booker prize. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The high spot on the
British list for Graham Swift's most recent novel, "Last Orders", confirms the
useful sales-bounce that the Booker prize, which Mr Swift won in October, can
give a literary novel on a normally middle-to-lowbrow list. Britain's top seller
is a funny-scary tale written specially for Christmas. The rest of it is made up
of old dependables: a thriller by Stephen King, spy novels by John le
Carr&eacute; and Frederick Forsyth, crime novels by Patricia Cornwell, Colin
Dexter and Dick Francis. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;German readers
continue to prefer thrillers and potboilers by foreigners to books by their own
writers. Wise words are as popular as ever. Jostein Gaarder, the Norwegian author
who astounded Europe's publishers five years ago by virtually creating a new
genre--philosophy-without-tears fiction--stays in form with "Durch einen Spiegel"
("Through a mirror"). His original hit, "Sophie's World" , is still,
astonishingly, on the German list at number ten.

<p><b>Management theory</b></p>
<h2>Downsized</h2><ul> <li><a href="11ex351.html">T<font size=-1>HE</font> W<font size=-1>ITCH</font> D<font size=-1>OCTORS</a>:</font> M<font size=-1>AKING</font> S<font size=-1>ENSE</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> M<font size=-1>ANAGEMENT</font> G<font size=-1>URUS</font>.&nbsp;  By John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge. <br>
</ul>

<p>MANAGEMENT theory is widely scorned by both the academic and business worlds. Yet every year more than 75,000 students in the United States receive the degree of Master of Business Administration, 15 times the number in 1960, and American business spends $15 billion a year on outside advice from management consultants. Business gurudom is itself a boom business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is this puzzle that these two journalists on <i>The Economist</i> seek to solve. They set themselves three tasks: to explain the great demand for management gurus, despite their evident failures; to chart the "unique selling proposition" of the chief proponents of the art; and to distinguish what is actually useful from the over-hyped dross that crowds the bookshops.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They succeed. To explain the demand is simple enough. It is created in part by the insecurity of corporate executives. All about them they see downsizing, rightsizing, restructuring--all those dreadful euphemisms for sacking people--and they want to improve their own performance. And it is created in part by the links between business books and the management consultancies whose employees spawn them: a bestseller generates business for the consultancy. Here it would have been helpful had the authors explored the question of why managements feel themselves so inadequate at the job they are paid to do that they have to hire management consultants to help them do it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Their section on the gurus rightly gives pride of place to the doyen of management theory, Peter Drucker. Taking the reader through his work and his influence, they outline his particular contributions, for example the idea that workers should be seen as a resource--that their ideas should be used--rather than just as a cost. Mr Drucker's books have flaws: some of the practical advice is dated, some of his later work the authors adjudge to be thin. But they believe that "what makes all this effort worthwhile is the sheer quality of his intellect...his relentlessly curious mind always makes the reader think."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The authors are less kind about the other guru with whom they deal at length, Tom Peters. He and another McKinsey consultant were backed by their employer to study the excellent company and their "In Search of Excellence", published in 1982, sold 5m copies within three years. There were only two snags. First, two-thirds of those "excellent" companies were no longer deemed to be so ten years later. Second, Mr Peters keeps changing his mind about what matters. In 1987, in his "Thriving on Chaos", he announced "there are no excellent companies".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The central portion of this book looks at the other ideas advanced by the rest of the pack and at the debates that their ideas have generated: the appropriate size and organisation of a company; how to manage knowledge businesses; corporate governance; outsourcing and the relationship between core workers and temporary workers; and so on. For the bemused manager all this is clear, useful, pithy and wise.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of these issues exercise American corporations, the most avid consumers of management theory. Is there another way? For a sideways, non-American look at practice elsewhere, they examine management in Japan, the business empire of the overseas Chinese and Britain's National Health Service. The conclusion, unsurprisingly, is that other models have interesting ideas but that there is no holy grail, no single "right" way of managing businesses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, that will not stop the proponents of the art, "the strange but annoyingly wealthy creatures", from continuing to prosper. That irritates the authors. It ought not to. This is a free market, not a rigged one, and the market is signalling that these gurus supply a need. If people want to read about the need to "synergise" or have "emotional bank accounts" that is fine. If companies want to send their managers off on character-building courses in the Andes then that is fine too. The demand has created the supply, not the other way round.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem, as with all new disciplines, is "how can we distinguish between the charlatans and the rest?" Alas, the authors pose that question only four pages from the end and give only the briefest sketch of an answer. Still, like their witch doctors, they provide good entertainment. Who knows? Mr Micklethwait and Mr Wooldridge may even become "strange but annoyingly wealthy creatures" too.

Introduction:
The Unacknowledged Legislators
<p>SHELLEY ONCE CLAIMED that poets are "the unacknowledged legislators of mankind." Today that honor belongs to management theorists. Names such as Drucker and Peters may not have the same ring as Wordsworth or Keats; yet, wherever one looks, management theorists are laying down the law, reshaping institutions, refashioning the language and, above all, reorganizing people's lives. Indeed, at its most extreme fringe, where management theory merges with the self-help industry, gurus are actually ordering people's minds, teaching them how to think about everything from organizing their desk to reassessing their love life. In late 1994 the revelation that Princess Diana had sought help from Anthony Robbins, a business-motivation guru who encourages his clients to "unleash the power within" by walking on red hot coals, caused barely a flicker of surprise in Fleet Street. On the other side of the Atlantic, the simultaneous news that Newt Gingrich, the Speaker-elect of the House of Representatives, was preparing for his new job "by reading Peter Drucker" was greeted with relief.</p>
<p>At the same time as the princess and the Speaker were seeking out management theory, millions of more mundane human beings were having it done unto them. Some 43 million jobs were eliminated in America in 1979-95 (though many more were created). In paternalist Germany, "downsizing" had pushed up unemployment to 4 million by early 1996--the highest level since the Second World War. In Japan, the home of lifetime employment, temporary and part- time workers now account for one in four of the workforce, and corporate loyalty is crumbling. In Britain, figures from the Department of Employment, leaked in December 1994, showed that 6.6 million men--or 44 percent of the male workforce--had been unemployed at some time since 1990; 3.9 million women--or roughly a third of the female workforce--had suffered the same fate.</p>
<p>Blue-collar workers everywhere are used to being laid off when times get tough. Nowadays, the victims are often managers; and a company does not have to be in dire financial trouble to start slimming. Three-quarters of the American companies in a survey carried out in April 1995 by Watson Wyatt, a London-based consultancy, admitted to restructuring in the past two years. </p>

Has your company survived a major management initiative, only to be
ambushed by another theory that demands that you rush fullspeed in the
opposite direction? Have you been told your fate depends on throwing yourself
body and soul into "reengineering," the search for "excellence," "quality,"
"360-degree assessment," or "chaos"? Which of the thousands of management
books should you read--or should you skip them all? Do you ever wish you had
an MBA, but wonder whether it is worth all that time and money? Have you
been downsized? Does "BOHICA" mean anything to you? Do you dream of the
day when the consultants will go away and let you get back to work?
<p>If your answer to any of the above questions is yes, The Witch Doctors should be the next book on your reading list. The result of a two-year research project conducted by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, editors at The Economist magazine, it is the first book to deflate the hype and self-promotion surrounding management theory to get a clear look at the truth about management.</p>
<p>The fact is, the business world is overrun by fads. Management gurus--high- powered consulting firms, business school professors, motivational speakers who never graduated from high school--are latterday witch doctors, each promising the cure for what ails corporate America. These men and women are the sales reps for an industry that exists exclusively to peddle freshly laid management advice to petrified executives. According to one recent study, 72 percent of managers believe that the right management tools can help ensure business success, even though 70 percent also say most of the tools promise more than they deliver. Often, the results are thousands of people losing their jobs or having their work lives irrevocably altered. But thousands of companies continue to grasp at the newest concept du jour--until the next sure thing comes along.</p>
<p>The irony is that some of the gurus' ideas and prescriptions really can rescue or renovate your company. But until you have read The Witch Doctors, your chances of figuring out which ideas belong in your hot file and which in your circular file are slim indeed.</p>
<p>Micklethwait and Wooldridge have organized The Witch Doctors around the management problems that plague today's corporations. They examine the promise and the problems of reengineering, and analyze what--and who--is driving the current boom in the management industry. The authors profile Peter Drucker and Tom Peters, helping you decide what the uber-gurus can teach you and what they can t. proceed to look deeply into the social and corporate implications of every major conundrum manager workers face today. Through unbiased, often contrarian investigations of knowledge, learning, innovation, strategy and vision, the future o workplace, shareholder versus stakeholder capitalism, globalization, and Japanese management Micklethwait and Wooldridge tell you what works, what fails, and what the future may hold for those who act and those who wait. Two groundbreaking chapters examine the inroads management theory is making in the public sector, and the unexpected paths y managers are blazing through the world economy. </p>

Put out by Duden, the publishers of dictionaries and grammars, it lists the recent long-awaited and much debated revisions to German spelling. Several Bundledtogetherwordgroups are now to be divided up into more manageable bits. Capital Letters are to be put to greater Use. And the custom that, commas must be scattered, liberally, like pepper, is to be, somewhat, relaxed.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not umlauts but hiplines are the concern of the American non-fiction leader, a slimming book from Oprah Winfrey. Management fads and foibles are made fun of in the bestselling "The Dilbert Principle". The O.J. Simpson trial is gone over (again) by a former prosecutor and biochemistry is explained by a scientist with help from a journalist. The early-19th century journey of Lewis and Clark continues to pull historically-minded readers. Notable is the lack of political bestsellers in this election season--unless you count a kiss-and-tell look at the Clinton White House by an ex-<font size=-1>FBI</font> agent who worked there and a polemic about "liberal" values from a conservative former appeals-court judge whom Congress deemed unfit for the Supreme Court.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Spelling aside, the rest of Germany's non-fiction list is full, as usual, of self-help literature. But there are three more interesting items. One is a book by a young American academic, Daniel Goldhagen, which blames a long tradition of German anti-Semitism for the Holocaust. Another is the story of Marion D&#246;nhoff, one of modern Germany's greatest newspaper publishers. The third is a continuation by one of eastern Germany's best writers, G&#252;nter de Bruyn, of his autobiographical chronicle, a remarkable story of an "ordinary" German who grew up under Hitler and lived in East Germany.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr De Bruyn's book reads like a good work of fiction. But the German fiction list itself shows how few Germans read their own novelists. Most entries are, as usual, translations. On the American list politics shows its head as fiction with Tom Clancy's White House thriller. And William Gibson, originator of the "cyberpunk" genre, shows continuing form with "Idoru".<br><h3>Bestsellers<a href="#foot">*</a></h3><ul><li><a href="#1">German fiction</a><li><a href="#2">American fiction</a><li><a href="#3">German non-fiction</a><li><a href="#4">American non-fiction </a></ul></td></tr></table><a name="1"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4> German fiction </h4><ol><li>	Der Regenmacher	<i>	 by John Grisham</i>. &#160; 	Tobacco-industry lawsuit	</li>	<li>	Durch einen Spiegel, in einem dunklen Wort	<i>	 by Jostein Gaarder</i>. &#160; 	The mystery of creation	</li>	<li>	Im Angesicht des Feindes	<i>	 by Elisabeth George</i>. &#160; 	Celebrities' kid kidnapped	</li>	<li>	Die Br&uuml;cken der Freiheit  	<i>	 by Ken Follett</i>. &#160; 	Love and bondage	</li>	<li>	Mein Herz so weiB	<i>	 by Javier Marias</i>. &#160; 	A honeymoon tragedy untangled 	</li>	<li>	Kalt ist der Abendhauch	<i>	 by Ingrid Noll</i>. &#160; 	In-laws in love	</li>	<li>	Werner: Na also!	<i>	 by Br&ouml;sel</i>. &#160; 	Cult comic character	</li>	<li>	Sofies Welt	<i>	 by Jostein Gaarder</i>. &#160; 	Teenager discovers western  philosophy	</li>	<li>	Geh, wohin dein Herz dich tr&auml;gt	<i>	 by Susanna Tamaro</i>. &#160; 	One family's history	</li>	<li>	Tr&auml;um den unm&ouml;glichen Traum	<i>	 by Johannes Mario Simmel</i>. &#160; 	A writer's life renewed 	</li></ol></td></tr></table><a name="2"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4>American fiction </h3><ol>				<li>	The Deep End of the Ocean	<i>	 by Jacquelyn Mitchard</i>. &#160; 	A child's disappearance	</li>	<li>	Executive Orders  	<i>	 by Tom Clancy</i>. &#160; 	Jack Ryan becomes president 	</li>	<li>	Jack and Jill	<i>	 by James Patterson</i>. &#160; 	A serial-killer duo	</li>	<li>	The Celestine Prophecy	<i>	 by James Redfield</i>. &#160; 	Prophetic literature	</li>	<li>	The Runaway Jury	<i>	 by John Grisham</i>. &#160; 	Law student fights corruption	</li>	<li>	The Last Don	<i>	 by Mario Puzo</i>. &#160; 	A mafioso's legacy	</li>	<li>	Servant of the Bones	<i>	 by Anne Rice</i>. &#160; 	A necromancer's curse	</li>	<li>	Cause of Death	<i>	 by Patricia Cornwell</i>. &#160; 	Medical examiner Kay Scarpetta returns 	</li>	<li>	The Tenth Insight 	<i>	 by James Redfield</i>. &#160; 	Appalachian inspiration	</li>	<li>	Idoru 	<i>	 by William Gibson</i>. &#160; 	Cyber-scandal	</li></td></tr></table><a name="3"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4>German non-fiction </a></h3><ol>					<li>	Die Deutsche Rechtschreibung	<i>	 by Editors of Duden</i>. &#160; 	German spelling and grammar	</li>	<li>	Hitlers willige Vollstrecker  	<i>	 by Daniel Goldhagen</i>. &#160; 	Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust	</li>	<li>	Gute M&auml;dchen Kommen in den Himmel	<i>	 by Ute Ehrhardt</i>. &#160; 	Tips for women on self-reliance 	</li>	<li>	Lexikon der popul&auml;ren Irrt&uuml;mer	<i>	 by Walter Kr&auml;mer & G&ouml;tz Trenkler </i>. &#160; 	Encyclopedia of popular fallacies	</li>	<li>	Meine Rezepte	<i>	 by Alfred Biolek</i>. &#160; 	Recipes for meals with famous guests	</li>	<li>	Sorge dich nicht, lebe!<i>	 by Dale Carnegie</i>. &#160; 	We have seen the enemy and it's anxiety	</li>	<li>	Emotionale Intelligenz	<i>	 by Daniel Goleman</i>. &#160; 	As important as IQ	</li>	<li>	Vom Richtigen Zeitpunkt	<i>	 by Johanna Paungger & Thomas Poppe</i>. &#160; 	Lunar tips for daily living 	</li>	<li>	Vierzig Jahre 	<i>	 by G&uuml;nter de Bruyn</i>. &#160; 	Wellknown East German writer looks back	</li>	<li>	Marion D&ouml;nhoff	<i>	 by Alice Schwarzer</i>. &#160; 	Portrait of the former co-publisher of Die Zeit	</li></ol></td></tr></table><a name="4"><br></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 name=""><tr><td valign=bottom align=left><img src="http://www.economist.com/review/images/instrap.gif"></td><td><hr size=5 width=70 align=left><h4>American non-fiction </h4><ol>				<li>	Make the Connection: Ten Steps to a Better Body	<i>	 by Bob Greene & Oprah Winfrey</i>. &#160; 	Talk-show host's slimming tips	</li>	<li>	Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus	<i>	 by John Gray</i>. &#160; 	Relationships	</li>	<li>	The Zone	<i>	 by Barry Sears with Bill Lawren</i>. &#160; 	A bio-chemist explains what it is	</li>	<li>	The Dilbert Principle	<i>	 by Scott Adams</i>. &#160; 	Management fads satirised	</li>	<li>	The Run for his Life: The People v O.J.

</ul><ul></ul>

BERLIN has long been a writer's delight. Whether as the moody back-drop for a cold-war thriller, the setting for a raucous tale of imagined decadence or simply as somewhere for reflective bohemians to hang out in, Germany's capital has had its full share of recent literary attention. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Interest used to come from abroad, particularly from Britain and America. German writers, it seems, were less attracted by Berlin's narrative potential than their foreign counterparts. But this has changed. Unification, with Berlin at its centre, was too good a theme to pass up.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>"</i>Since unification one is stuck in a jam,<i>"</i> writes Uwe Timm in "Johannesnacht" (Midsummer Eve), his tale of a man doing research on the history of the potato, a Berlin staple, who embarks on a bewildering tour of the city and discovers that more than traffic is gridlocked. Against the back-drop of an artistically wrapped Reichstag, the first-person narrator sweeps across the city meeting arms dealers, night-club girls, robust hairdressers and delicate intellectuals. The result is an impressionistic picture of a city where everything is, or seems to be, in movement--confusingly, perhaps, but also exhilaratingly. You might say that it was ever thus in Berlin. But Mr Timm, who lives in Munich, brings a fresh excitement to the imaginative experience of the city.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sandra Kellein, a youngish west German now living in Berlin, has turned her own experiences of living in the city into a novel that delves into the more uncomfortable aspects of post-unification Germany. "Gold oder Rabenschwarz" (Gold or Pitchblack) is the story of two westerners who move east in search of adventure. But they realise that what divides east and west involves more than elegantly dilapidated apartment blocks, cobbled streets and antediluvian plumbing. There are deep differences of attitude and expectation, some older than East Germany. Ms Kellein's novel explores this gap.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Thorsten Becker writes from the other side of the divide. Ostensibly set in 2045 when Germany and the world is divided between Chinese and Brazilian spheres of influence, "Sch&#246;nes Deutschland" (Beautiful Germany) expands on east German feelings of nostalgia in a satirical tale. Looking back to the 1990s the narrator, an actor at the Berliner Ensemble in east Berlin, recounts how after years of trying to grew together east and west are once again divided following a popular revolution. The German Democratic Republic is re-established, though this time in different form. The government, led by the New Socialist Unity Party, is composed of easterners and westerners alike. The nice sides of consumer capitalism are retained while the more painful aspects of economic transition, such as privatisation, are reversed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Mr Becker teases out the ironic possibilities of the situation. With everything returned to the way it should be, the narrator can get back to rehearsing for "Arturo Ui", Bertolt Brecht's allegorical tale of the breakdown of civil society and the drift into dictatorship. For those in the know, the novel is full of little swipes at east Berlin's fashionable theatre scene where hankerings for the past, when "culture producers" were part of a cosy elite, are popular. At the end, Mr Becker's narrator leaves Berlin and the "new" East Germany to join his girlfriend in the west--just as many eastern writers and artists did in the 1970s and 1980s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While Mr Becker writes satire set in a deliberately implausible future, Ingo Schramm dwells on present-day Berlin. He also writes with an eastern perspective and uses story-telling, symbolically, to make larger points. In "Fitchers Blau" (Fitcher's Blue) two would-be lovers, Janni and Karl, are prevented from developing a relationship when they discover that they are brother and sister. The events of recent history are painfully turned over and connections made. Street riots in post-unification Berlin evoke memories of police violence at civil-rights demonstrations during the last days of communism. If it sounds heavy-handed, Mr Schramm does overdo his effort to squeeze the political from the personal. Janni's and Karl's wicked father, for example, is named "Joseph" (as were Stalin and Goebbels). What starts as a novel soon declines into parable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As might be expected from a better established and more experienced writer, Monika Maron is subtler in her handling of the east-west theme. An easterner who moved west in the 1980s, Ms Maron has never hesitated to tease <i>Ossis</i> for their post-unity whingeing. "Animal Triste" (the title recalls the gloomy Latin tag about sex) is her first <i>Liebesroman</i>. It tells of an old lady who has lived a broken half-existence following the abrupt departure of a lover many years ago. Holed up in a shabby apartment in east Berlin the lady spends her time mentally reliving those precious moments. Everything else--her neighbours, her failing health, the fall of the Berlin Wall--is a blur. In her increasing detachment from reality even her own memories become confused. Threaded through this bleak tale are links between human and less personal relationships. The lover who left so suddenly was a westerner. The concrete division between the two Berlins that separates the two lovers puts the affair into a fading limbo.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of these books, with the possible exception of Ms Maron's, can be offered in good conscience as examples of Germany's better fiction-writing. But German publishers have complained so long about the state of the German literary novel that they seem ready to try anything, including bald imitation. This batch of Berlin books follows the surprising success last year of Thomas Brussig's "Helden wie wir" (Heroes Like Us). That tale of East German disintegration, which will be published in Britain in 1997, had the advantage of being funny. Unfortunately, Mr Brussig's imitators lack his bite.

<p><b>Romantic tales</b></p>
<h2>Bedazzled</h2><ul> <li>V<font size=-1>ICTORIAN</font> L<font size=-1>OVE</font> S<font size=-1>TORIES</font>.</a>&nbsp;  Edited by Kate Flint.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>OUP; 516 pages; &#163;17.99 and $29.95</i> <br>
</ul>


<p>MOST of these 32 stories are of romance and doom. Lovers are parted through the inequity of their social status: the young gentleman of the house and the pretty maid; the vicar's low-born widow who cannot marry a gardener, her old flame, because of the priggish opposition of her son. Other couples are parted when the past misdemeanours or crimes of the man threaten to bring shame on them: the ex-forger, for instance, who leaves the stationer's daughter on their wedding eve.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a story by Kipling, a British man in Burma discards without a thought his Burmese housekeeper and companion to find the requisite English bride. A story by Grace Aguilar tells of a young man smitten with a charming girl. He removes himself when he discovers that she is a blue-stocking. Such a woman, he assumes, would not make a good domestic wife. (A happy reunion takes place many years later.) Henry James describes the ideal sort of woman: "She was, moreover, mistress of a very pretty little fortune, and was accounted clever without detriment to her amiability and amiable without detriment to her wit."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bang in the middle of the book is its only funny story: "An Elixir of Love" by W.S. Gilbert. A young vicar, a Leveller, tries to put into practice his political beliefs by dispensing a potion that makes whoever takes it fall in love with the first person encountered, regardless of his or her rank. Thus the dowager marries the publican, the Etonian marries the sexton's widow, and the bishop marries the old deaf cook. In this way are the class barriers banished.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of the Victorian and Edwardian masters are represented--Gaskell, Trollope, James, Collins, Kipling and Wilde--and highly enjoyable they are too, if you can discard the feeling that most of the stories have been chosen to highlight a prejudice or show up the mores of the time. There are slushy stories, fantasies, allegories and rattling good yarns. Few of the women get their man. They are defeated, generally, by external circumstances. As you might imagine, there is no sexual activity to speak of.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A beautiful story by Oscar Wilde, "The Nightingale and the Rose", concludes the collection. The boy fails to get the girl.
<ul><font size=-1>'What a silly thing Love is!' said the student as he walked away. 'It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.'</font></ul>

<p><b>Literary lives</b></p>
<h2>No immunity</h2><ul> <li>V<font size=-1>IRGINIA</font> W<font size=-1>OOLF</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Hermione Lee.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Chatto and Windus; 892 pages; &#163;20</i> <br>
</ul>


<p>THERE seems at the moment to be an appetite for monumental literary biographies, something that sets you wondering: do writers live their lives twice over? Is biography a necessary route to their books, especially with the great 19th- and early 20th-century figures (to speak only of them) whose work was so self-exploratory? Now at the end of the 20th century, are they fading, their worlds and ideas no longer within easy grasp? And, more simply, does biography also satisfy a desire for "character" and "life" in an old-fashioned (and unWoolfian) sense, for a good long novel with a story, details, a shape?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hermione Lee's biography of Virginia Woolf is a huge book partly because it answers "yes" to all these questions. But here there is also something more. There are plenty of readers who cannot stand Virginia Woolf, seeing only her rarefied snootiness and the social mannerisms of her class and circle. Yet it is curious how, in spite of those things, she still manages to speak, privately, as it were, in the ear. Ms Lee has felt this, the nearness as well as the distance, as she says herself in her final chapter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recovering that special quality in Virginia Woolf from the impatience of the anti-Bloomsburyites takes time--as does, equally, recovering it from her more recent "discoverers", who see in her an abused victim of the patriarchy. Her childhood experiences at the hands of her half-brother George Duckworth, her "madness", her difficulties over eating, her "sapphism" are modish issues, and any biographer has to address them. Ms Lee does so with good sense, but it is a fair guess that, apart from Virginia Woolf's friendships with women, they were not for her the most interesting parts of the book.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A professor of literature, Ms Lee confesses to wondering whether she is intelligent enough for Virginia Woolf, and that shows a bit in the earlier chapters in a kind of pedagogic conscientiousness: three quotes to make a point, say, followed by an explanatory summary, as though not quite daring to trust the reader. But this passes, and the book takes off, the diaries and letters joining in the narrative, Virginia Woolf's own voice moving fluidly in and out and infecting its atmosphere with her own extraordinary drama. Once, in her diary, she exclaimed disarmingly "How I interest myself!", the reason being that she was so many selves. It is this that comes across. It is true that at her creative core, her desire was to become essentially faceless, nobody, the "damned egotistical self", as she called it, banished. But meanwhile the egotistical selves oblige--fantastical virtuoso talker, rational public conscience, batty aunt, and so on--and behind them all, the observer, recording it in what amounts to her own vast and scattered autobiography. It is something merely to keep up with her.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More than a decade ago, in "Virginia Woolf: A Writer's Life", Lyndall Gordon brilliantly traced the paths of Virginia Woolf's selves, where they led to and fro across her life and her books. It is a subtle, sane, and clear-eyed book, which refuses, like Ms Lee's, to pin Virginia Woolf down as victim or icon or high priestess of lyrical sensibility. It is no slight to this biographer to say that her book brings the other to mind again and again. Of course, accounts of Virginia Woolf's main preoccupations would be bound to coincide: her loathing for the male establishment, her belief in the fluidity of life beneath its facts and fixities, the central significance of memory. All this is familiar, but it is striking how both biographies bring out the drama, the play between "the articulate, witty surface of her mind", as Gordon describes it, and the "wordless depths".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But whereas with Gordon this becomes a tool for literary analysis, with Lee it is the heart of a story. Her book is a biography as much as it is "a writer's biography": Virginia Woolf with houses and furniture, and earnings, and clothes, and of course, aunts and in-laws and friends. Lytton Strachey, Roger Fry, Vita Sackville-West, Ethel Smyth and the rest are all there, together with their politics and aesthetics and sexual proclivities. Virginia Woolf herself could gaily strike off her world and its characters with dazzling phrases and telling details, but at this distance the biographer must be at greater pains to convey it, especially Virginia Woolf's sense of it: as someone at once haunted by the past and modern, an outsider on principle, and yet on her own terms, intensely interested.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Virginia Woolf herself hated the idea of being "someone", fixed and known, and her biographer stresses how she longed always to withdraw into anonymity, or "immunity" as she also termed it. This fierce need for privacy has helped give Virginia Woolf her ivory-tower reputation. Yet Ms Lee turns it into something solid, a bedrock, something to know her by. Take her or leave her, one does seem to know this Virginia Woolf, like someone in a novel. So much so that her suicide note to her husband and her last walk to the river brought tears to this reviewer's eyes.

LISTEN to the politicians and this is a confusing time to be an Australian. They cannot even make up their minds where the country is. Paul Keating insisted that Australia was part of Asia, until he had to backtrack under Asian fire. John Howard, his successor as prime minister, seems to be presiding over something of a backlash. In recent debates about immigration white Australian politicians have expressed fears about being "swamped" by Asians.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The country's place in the world does not preoccupy its writers any more than European integration exercises British ones. But in the novel that won this year's Miles Franklin award, the country's top literary prize, Christopher Koch does explore the impact of Asia on one Australian and so repeats the formula that made a fine film of his "The Year of Living Dangerously", the story of an Australian journalist living through the turmoil in Indonesia in the mid-1960s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In "Highways to a War", a photo-journalist has disappeared in Cambodia in 1976, a year after the Khmers Rouges took power. The novel reconstructs his life, from the frustrations of youth in Tasmania to the horror of war in Vietnam and Cambodia. The reader senses that manifest destiny lies in the East, not just for the journalist but also for Australia. Soon after he arrives in Asia he meets an ageing spy who tells him: "In my day, as soon as we'd come of age, we hopped on a ship to Europe, to make direct contact with history; you've sensed that the vortex is here. You're right."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The novel is a gripping and moving read, but it is better at dealing with the foreign press corps than with Asians. The hero's loves, in particular, seem romanticised portrayals of an Asia many foreigners would like to believe in.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At least Mr Koch is a relatively uncontroversial prize-winner. In 1995 the Miles Franklin award went to "The Hand That Signed the Paper", by a writer calling herself Helen Demidenko. It dealt with the Ukrainian involvement in the Holocaust, and was alleged to be anti-Semitic. The author defended herself and her book by claiming that her sources included her Ukrainian father and his family. The prize-givers were made to look ridiculous when it transpired that she was in fact called Helen Darville and that her parents were English. Even now, anger at the deception seethes electronically on the Internet in discussion groups on Australian literature.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;David Malouf, one of Australia's best-known novelists, is of Lebanese and Sephardic-Jewish extraction but does not make a thing either of his ethnicity or of his Australian-ness. When he is asked,"Who is the greatest Australian writer?" he likes to reply "Shakespeare".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Malouf uses the English language beautifully. "The Conversations at Curlow Creek" is set in 1827, in the outback of New South Wales, where a police officer has been sent to supervise the hanging of a bush-ranger and former convict. Through the condemned man's last night, the book traces the Irish pasts that link the two men and brought them to Australia, at a time when the nation was just being formed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like David Malouf, Janette Turner Hospital uses a remote part of Australia to explore universal themes. "Oyster", set in an unfriendly opal-mining area in deepest Queensland, tells of a millennarian cult that sets up shop there. Miss Hospital has studied gurus such as David Koresh of Waco whose charisma caused a cataclysm. The novel is a powerful evocation of the hypnotic repressive powers of both geographic isolation and religious hysteria.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When "Oyster" begins, the local apocalypse has already happened. Indeed, it is a curious fact that all the novels considered here begin, in a sense, at the end, and devote their stories to reaching the point at which they begin. In Paul Horsfall's quirky and funny "The Touchstone", the 99-year-old narrator is digging his own grave in his garden. As he does so, he unearths the keepsakes he has obsessively buried there throughout his life. Through them the story of his unhinged life is told, against the backdrop of a century of Australian history.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Glenda Adams's "The Tempest of Clemenza" the mechanism for delving into the past is a diary, sought by a woman who bursts in during a stormy night on the novel's main character, a female Abel, and her dying 13-year-old daughter, Clemenza. When found, the diary takes the story away from contemporary America to Sydney in the 1950s and 1960s. Again, the story is told over the last hours of a life, as is "Curlow Creek" and "Touchstone".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like the other novels, "The Tempest" addresses the question of how things came to this pass. It would be fanciful to see in this some national search for the origins of the present predicament. More likely, it is a coincidence. Politicians other than Mr Keating have stressed the importance of culture in forging a national identity and they are right to do so. But, mercifully, Australia's best writers rise above a self-conscious search for a national style or theme. Australian culture has many sources and strands and can benefit from both its European and aboriginal history as well as from its (nearly) Asian geography.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is certainly benefiting from the new technology of the Internet, not just in discussion groups, but also through two big databases. One is run as a subscription service by the Australian Defence Force Academy (<a href="http://www.lib.adfa.oz.au/web/austlit">http://www.lib.adfa.oz.au/web/austlit</a>); the other is a splendid "labour of love" by two literary geeks, Peter and Mareya Schmidt at <a href="http://www.vicnet.net.au/~ozlit/">http://www.vicnet.net.au/~ozlit/</a>.The literary scene resembles Australia itself--vibrant, diverse, at times abrasive, and hard to pigeon-hole. All these novels are recommended. All help illuminate what a confusing time it is to be a human being--and not just an Australian one.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
THE ONLY LIGHT in the hut came from the doorway behind him. Streaming in off the moon-struck
plain, it cast his shadow across the packed earth floor and at an angle up the slab wall opposite but
revealed nothing more in the stifling gloom than a stub of candle in the neck of a bottle and the rim of
a wooden slop-bucket. Adair's first thought was, There is no one here, he has escaped, the bird is
flown. It surprised him, after his two-day ride, and considering all that depended for him on what the
man might have to tell, that he felt relieved. What is it in us, what is it in me, he thought, that we
should be so divided against ourselves, wanting our life and at the same time afraid of it? He stepped in
under the lintel. Behind him it was the trooper now whose bulk filled the doorway and broke its light.
<p>'Get out of the light,' he told him. 'It's as dark as the tomb in here.' But the trooper hung there and did not move.</p>
<p>There was a strong smell on the place of some previous animal occupant, sheep or goat. That, and the choking sense of confinement, as if he had stepped underground, must have confused his senses or he would surely have been aware of the man's breathing, and of course the moment he was - it was rackety, broken with phlegm, or perhaps his chest was injured - he made the fellow out, an agglomeration of rags with its knees drawn up, in which he distinguished, as his eyes adjusted, hands clasped over the knees, bare feet drawn together, a brow gleaming with sweat, though nothing as yet of the features beneath.</p>
<p>'Let's have a light in here,' he told the trooper.</p>
<p>The head was raised at that. One eye was puffed and closed, the other blinked in puzzlement, and Adair was struck by its pulpiness and light. So alive!</p>
<p>He was here, right enough. Still drawing breath. A hulk of flesh still pouring out fetid warmth. The smell he had mistaken for goat was the stink of sour flesh and dirt, with a reminder of what nature had contributed to the slopbucket.</p>
<p>Adair eased the satchel off his back.</p>
<p>'Are you deaf?' he demanded of the trooper, a lanky, slouching, thickheaded fellow in undershirt and unlaced boots, who continued to stand with his head dipped under the door-frame and one hand on the latch. 'I thought I asked you to fetch a light.' </p>

The year is 1827. In a remote hut on the high plains of New South Wales, two strangers spend the
night in talk. One, Carney, an illiterate Irishman, ex-convict and bushranger, is to be hanged at dawn.
The other, Adair, is the officer of the police who has been sell out to supervise the hanging. As the
night wears on, the two men share memories and uncover unlikely connections in their lives. Outside
the hut, Adair's troopers sit uneasily, waiting for the mornig to come.
<p>Carney questions the accidents of birth and fortune that have brought him to this point. Adair looks back to Ellersley, the household in the west of Ireland into which he was adopted: to his relationship with his young foster-brother, Fergus, and the imperious and mercurial Virgilia, daughter of a neighbouring landowner.What has brought Adair all the way to Australia? And why is Carney, and what Carney knows, so important to his future? Delicately, in prose of precise and evocative power, David Malouf's new novel reveals a web of relationships that enabraces Carney and his past, and the deep ties that underscore Adair's mission</p>
<p>The Conversations at Curlow Creek is a luminously rich and moving novel. In a narrative of growing intensity, it explores questions of nature and justice, reason and un-reason, the workings of fate, the force of love, as it dares an ever more dangerous intimacy, and of compassion, as it challenges duty. Continually opening up new levels of perception on its characters and their world, the novel finally gives us a powerful sense both of our isolation and of the experiences that are silently shared between us. It will confirm David Malouf as one of the greatest novelists in the language. </p>

<p><b>Wall Street investment</b></p>
<h2>Timeless tips</h2><ul> <li>T<font size=-1>HE</font> M<font size=-1>EMOIRS</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> D<font size=-1>EAN</font> <font size=-1>OF</font> W<font size=-1>ALL</font> S<font size=-1>TREET</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Benjamin Graham.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>McGraw Hill; 351 pages; $27.95</i> <br>
</ul>



<p>HE DIED aged 82 in 1976, but Benjamin Graham remains a towering figure in finance. "Security Analysis", which he wrote with David Dodd in 1934, is considered an indispensable text by many professional investors. In his other classic, "The Intelligent Investor", Mr Graham codified the principles of "value investing". This seeking out of undervalued or neglected securities is now an utterly respectable method of stock picking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Written in his later years and now published for the first time, Graham's memoirs provide an engaging and, at times, surprisingly frank account of his life. Driven by some demon, he dwells on every flaw in his famously upright character. He confesses his long-lasting shame over his early collusion in some Wall Street mischief. He agonises over his ambivalent attitude towards serving in the first world war. He mulls over his difficulty in forming lasting friendships, and over his complicated personal life (he married four times).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Graham was exceptionally talented. He was an outstanding student, especially of mathematics, but also of the classics and literature. Before leaving Columbia to begin his career on Wall Street, he was offered teaching positions by three departments of the university.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But leave he did, and it quickly became obvious that in the buying and selling of securities he had found a natural outlet for his drive for material success. Graham had both an analytical ability to spot unrealised value and a tenacious will to unlock it. He discovered that dry official reports and statistics often provided a better guide to under- and over-priced shares than market gossip. His researches proved as lucrative as they were novel.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During the Great Depression, Graham lost nearly everything. He turned briefly to writing and even completed a play which opened on Broadway, only to close after four performances. Astute investments bailed him out. By 1935 he had recovered all the money he had lost. He never looked back--until he tinkered in retirement with an autobiography. Evidently Graham saw himself as a bit of a writer as well as an investment analyst. But his memoirs mix regret with self-regard and smugness. Each craft has its own secrets of success and as a writer he wins more points for frankness than for style: he was not, he suggests, a very nice person.

<p>IN A poll conducted a few years ago, Clint Eastwood was voted the most popular film star of all time. This two-disc anthology of his career covers all of the 53 films he has made and includes a booklet written by his biographer, Richard Schickel; Mr Eastwood gives the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> his blessing in the foreword and he discusses his films and career as the searcher browses with the help of its icon-based menu.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Films are split into genre categories such as "cops" and "backroads and bar-rooms". The opening screen for each resembles the graphics of a high-tech video game, with a montage of images from each film in the genre. After clicking on the relevant image, the searcher enters the "screening room". This is the nearest the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> gets to film buffery. Leading members of the cast and crew are listed (no best-boy or focus-pulling credits for the complete cinematic anorak), along with a plot synopsis and box-office receipts in North America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each film is accompanied by a couple of reprinted reviews, with brickbats placed alongside plaudits. A glimpse of each film is provided by a handful of clips which incorporate Mr Eastwood's trademark sardonic one-liners and mythic gunplay. The picture resolution of the clips is excellent, but they provide more of a gimmick than a reference tool and absorb memory space that could have been better used. At present a video is still required to view Mr Eastwood's films properly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A trivia game, containing over 450 questions, tests the will of the most devoted Clintophile and is humorously punctuated by Mr Eastwood's adjudication. If you choose the wrong answer to questions like the name on the neon sign shot to pieces in "Dirty Harry", Detective Callahan will advise you that "A man's gotta know his limitations"; correct answers merely receive a sarcastic "that's great" from the inspector. The "Timeline" chronology of Mr Eastwood's life and career is the most informative section of the package, as well as the most entertaining.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The immediacy of the medium compared with its print alternative comes across best when Mr Eastwood explains on-screen why he turned down roles in "The Killing Fields" and "Apocalypse Now"; or when Meryl Streep discusses how he runs his set and directs his actors. Unfortunately, Miss Streep is one of the few voices discussing Mr Eastwood's <i>oeuvre</i>. Several other of his collaborators--Bruce Surtees, for instance, a cinematographer, or Lennie Niehaus, a composer--would have been welcome guests on this <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>. Gene Hackman, Kevin Costner and John Malkovich have all been recent co-stars and the searcher feels deprived of their professional opinions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much of Mr Eastwood's career has involved pleasing two types of audience: his commercial "tough guy" movies for his fans has won him studio backing for much smaller, personal projects, such as "Bronco Billy" and "Honkytonk Man". Starwave has also aimed to satisfy two audiences in producing a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> that will both please the fans and grace the shelves of the university film library. Of the two, the film student will be narrowly beaten to the draw.

<p><b>The Reader's Digest</b></p>
<h2>Pulped</h2><ul> <li><a href="12ex373.html">A<font size=-1>MERICAN</font> D<font size=-1>REAMERS</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Peter Canning. <br>
</ul>

<p>IT IS a parable for the times. DeWitt and Lila Wallace, the folksy founders of the <i>Reader's Digest</i>, the world's most popular magazine, treat their employees as family. In their dotage, hard men seize control of the business. They slash staff and wages, and profits soar. So does the share price, from $18 in 1984 to a pre-split $440 in 1990. The hard men, naturally, fatten their own pay packets and arrange the most golden of parachutes for themselves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It ends in tears. As the hard men concentrate on the mailing list, the magazine loses first its soul and then its circulation. Hack editors commission soft features of the "Unforgettable Shirley Temple" sort together with articles that pander to knee-jerk conservatives: "Don't buy these environmental myths", "Must our prisons be resorts?", "Workers' compensation: licence to steal", "What health-care crisis?"
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even from such seasoned critics of big business as, say, Michael Moore or Alexander Cockburn, charges like that would create a stir. Coming, as they do, from an insider they have caused a storm. Peter Canning, a "Digester" for 25 years and managing editor from 1980 to 1988, loved the Wallaces' magazine and he writes with barely controlled fury about the hard men ruining its integrity. Perhaps his anger explains why Mr Canning takes so long to clear his throat. It is not until about page 50 that his business saga really sings. After that it hardly hits a wrong note. The shrewd-yet-naive, the worldly-yet-provincial Wallaces are brought to life.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the circulation of the <i>Reader's Digest</i> takes off, DeWitt has more money than he needs so he awards his staff above-market wages and benefits and pays his suppliers more than their contracts demand. He hates privilege. When the Canadian company orders a limo in Montreal to take the Wallaces to Expo '67, DeWitt pleads: "But we don't want special treatment. We want to go as just plain people." The limo is cancelled and he and Lila travel by subway and queue to get in. At the annual Old Timers' dinner for retired Digesters, he chats happily with the lowliest janitor and dances with the fattest secretary.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Try as they might, his executives cannot persuade him to increase the magazine's cover price to swell profits. "What's the point?" he asks. "All the extra profit ends up in my bank account, and then I have to think up ways to give it back." Other eccentricities cause his executives more discomfort. He asks them, for instance, to volunteer to report at a railway station at eight in the morning to pick up litter that is clogging the line. DeWitt meets them there, hands out garbage bags and spiked sticks, points to the tracks and says: "There's the enemy, gentlemen. Let's get to it."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Every article in his magazine had to meet three tests. First: Is it quotable? Something people will remember and discuss? Second: Is it applicable? Does it come within the orbit of most people's interest and conversation? Will they find it useful? Third: Is it of lasting interest? Or is it too ephemeral, too perishable, to be of lively interest months or even years later?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the staff expands and the <i>Reader's Digest </i>editionalises, fewer articles pass these tests. During the cold war the magazine is seen by the <font size=-1>CIA</font> as a progaganda tool and is converted, through its pliable Washington office, into an impassioned supporter of the military build-up in Vietnam and of other foreign adventures. Though he cannot see a flag without waving it, DeWitt finds it hard to sustain an interest in world affairs. At a lunch for top government officials and academics to discuss Asian geopolitics with senior editors, the table is stunned when DeWitt pipes up to ask whether breast-feeding explains why Japanese babies cry less than American ones.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The account of the Wallaces' last days makes painful reading. After DeWitt dies, Lila, aged 93 and weighing barely 100 pounds, is inundated with flowers and telephone calls, and a parade of cars bearing well-wishers swishes through the gates. Once it becomes plain that she is leaving everything to charity, the phone goes dead. At the end, the family chauffeur is her sole regular visitor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not until its last chapters does the book falter. The generosity of Lila and DeWitt raises a moral dilemma that the angry Mr Canning skirts by claiming, unconvincingly, that the Wallaces would have redone their wills had they known that a handful of charities would get so much. In fact, the hard men's greed helped the good causes. They not only awarded themselves lottery-sized increases in pay and benefits; they also hugely increased the value of the shares the Wallaces left to charity. By 1993 the ten chief beneficiaries were enriched by more than $4 billion. The Metropolitan Museum alone had $522m more, the Lincoln Centre $488m, the Bronx Zoo $220m. And that, as either Wallace might have said, buys a lot of chopped chicken liver.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Part 1
<p>De Witt 1889-1920</p>
<p>CHAPTER ONE</p>
<p>That he was different from their other children was immediately clear to both parents. Janet Wallace was enamored: "He is a baby of the first water," she wrote to her mother. "A prize, a premium, a paragon." James Wallace, A.B., M.A., Ph.D., LL.D., professor of Greek at tiny Macalester College in suburban St. Paul, Minnesota, was not so sure. "The child is a rogue, a rascal, a bandit, a thief," he wrote to his father-in-law, "without character or reputation, utterly lawless, wandering where he will . . ."</p>
<p>Their disagreement extended even to the newcomer's name. "I favor plain John Wallace," James wrote. "Since Janet doesn't endorse this - she favors James, or Harold, or Hubert - guess we will call him Anonymous for a while."</p>
<p>"For a while" extended from the baby's birth, on November 12, 1889, until three days before Christmas, when his parents finally settled on a name that was anything but plain: William Roy was Janet's choice ("Roy for royal," she insisted. "Roy for king!"), while James held out for De Witt, after a favorite cousin in Lafayette, Indiana. Thus did little Anonymous - part paragon, part rogue - become William Roy De Witt Wallace.</p>
<p>Although delighted with her newest child, Janet Wallace reacted to the stress of his birth as she often reacted to physical crises: by becoming weak and melancholy. She and "Roy-Dee," as she began calling him, remained confined to her bedroom upstairs in the big frame house at 1596 Summit Avenue, across from the Macalester campus, until Christmas Day, when they joined the family downstairs for the first time. She doted on the child, holding him for hours at a time, dreaming of the great things he would achieve. But when she grew tired, the baby was quickly turned over to her sister, Miriam Maude, who had come to live with the family the year before.</p>
<p>As the New Year began, Macalester's financial status neared disaster. Basic running expenses could not be met, and the college sank deeply into debt. Faculty members left in despair, and the president was forced out. In early summer, with his salary months in arrears, James traveled one hundred miles north to become temporary preacher in the town of Fisher. The money he earned - at $10 a sermon - was needed to fend off creditors. While he was away, the family - including De Witt's older brothers, Ben and Robert (known as Robin), and older sister Helen - summered with Janet's parents in Wooster, Ohio. It was not the first time this had happened, nor would it be the last. </p>

The fascinating, behind-the-scenes story of Reader's Digest and its
founders, and how this beloved American institution lost its innocence
when corporate lawyers and Wall Street wrested control from the men
the founders chose to preserve their business "in the Wallace mode."
<p>Today a multibillion-dollar publishing colossus, Reader's Digest began life in 1922 in a tiny basement storeroom in New York's Greenwich Village. The magazine's founders, De Witt and Lila Wallace, believed deeply in the American dream and saw their magazine as a way of spreading this belief to millions of their fellow citizens. Born in 1889 in St. Paul, Minnesota, De Witt was a mischievous and independent lad - his father, president of Macalester College, doubted that his "good for nothing" son would ever amount to anything. Determined to prove his father wrong, De Witt dropped out of college in 1912 to roam the northwestern states, peddling maps and farming brochures, all the while pondering an idea that had come to him during many hours spent reading magazines and newspapers: to identify, organize and condense "information of truly lasting value." This simple idea - to offer members of a "cooperative reading service" the basic truths, values and ideals he himself treasured - would become the cornerstone of his publishing empire.</p>
<p>From the beginning, the business was set up to be run like a family, the Wallaces having decided early on not to have children but to make their magazine and its employees their children. The address they chose for the Digest was the aptly named town of Pleasantville, New York, and the physical plant they created to house it was an imposing Georgian brick structure set amid gardens and orchards like an elegant campus. Unable to spend their fortune on themselves, the Wallaces lavished it instead on their employees. "Digesters" worked in splendid offices, with challenging jobs, bountiful salaries and futures secure for life.</p>
<p>They saw themselves as part of something special - a community, a family. And they believed that the sunny days in Pleasantville would never end.</p>
<p>But this is not a happily-ever-after fairy tale. In the early eighties, when the seemingly immortal Wallaces suddenly faltered, a shadow fell over Pleasantville as ambitious men began to scheme and manoeuvre for power. Much has been reported about what happened next, but always from the outside, through a veil of rumor and obfuscation. Now in American Dreamers, Digest insider and longtime man ageing editor Peter Canning reveals for the first time the appalling dimensions of the struggle that consume Camelot: * How the ailing Wallaces were isolated in their hilltop castle, ignored by the colleagues whose fortunes they had made, mistreated by the keepers those colleagues saw fit to provide, hopeless and alone; * How 60 percent of the Wallaces' Digest stock - today worth more than three billion dollars - was transferred from their own charitable funds into certain newly created funds that often supported causes dear to the heart of Digest director/trustee Laurance Rockefeller; * How, to please Wall Street and the charities - and enrich themselves - the new managers turned Camelot upside down, firing thousands of loyal employees, slashing editorial budgets, raising prices, lowering quality, terminating benefits pioneered by the Wallaces over many years and in general transforming life in Pleasantville, for decades the epitome of the American Dream, into a gray and dreary American Nightmare.</p>
<p>In the tradition of such recent bestsellers as Den of Thieves and Barbarians at the Gate, American Dreamers offers yet another metaphor for all that has gone wrong in America in recent years: the slippage from a time when an idealistic young entrepreneur and his indomitable bride could build a simple idea into a beneficent empire, to a time when greedy men spend their days scavenging what the entrepreneur created. </p>

<p>"DID you use to be R.D. Laing?" was the plaintive title of a television film made in 1988 about modern Britain's most controversial psychiatrist. A stranger had asked Laing the question in the street. Once famous and influential as a radical therapist, he had sunk into obscurity, his humane ideas about treating psychoses clouded in a fog of leftism, psychedelic drugs and Indian mysticism. When he died of a heart-attack on the tennis court a year later, "his hold on posterity" looked "tenuous indeed" even to Daniel Burston, his sympathetic biographer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Mr Burston is convincing when he argues that Laing's reputation has fallen too far. Though not up there, as Mr Burston would have readers believe, in the psychoanalytic pantheon with Freud and Jung, Laing was a significant British voice in the movement against the crueller excesses of institutional psychiatry--locked wards, lobotomies, electric-shock therapy--a movement that from the 1950s did something to humanise the treatment of mad people in Europe and America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Laing may not have been a great thinker and before long his doctoring became erratic if not downright irresponsible. But as a "lucid and compassionate theorist of human misery", in Mr Burston's words, he had an empathy for madness that was quite rare in his trade. Unluckily for those around him, he had a nastier side which he gave into more and more as drink and fame--to which he also grew addicted--did their damage, not least to his reputation as a healer of sick minds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stories of Laing's grossness abound. At dinner he might stalk off growling, "I don't think I'll be bothered with this." Or he might challenge a fellow guest to wrestle. He was arrogant, intellectually snobbish and bullying. Even admirers admitted that he was often bombastic and self-indulgent. He had a streak of misogynism and once told Stokely Carmichael, a Black Power spokesman, that he disliked the smell of black people. He fathered ten children by four women, few of whom looked upon him as a model father.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His biographers, who both trained in psychology, trace much of this bad behaviour to a brutalised childhood in Glasgow. Relations with his mother were especially tortured. Of the two books, Mr Clay's gives the livelier account of Laing's turbulent life. Without neglecting his abundant flaws, he shows readers his appeal--and even his achievements. Mr Burston is better on Laing's ideas, seeing in that early wretchedness his later sympathy with the insane.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Laing's compassion, to use modern terms, was directed at the misery of the psychoses, especially schizophrenia, a crippling condition in which sufferers lose their hold on reality. No school of psychiatry--behavioural, chemical or psychoanalytical--had at the time a decent explanation. Laing refused in particular to accept the common view that schizophrenia came from biochemical (and perhaps inherited) abnormalities and was therefore treatable with drugs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead, to him, the very line between madness and normality was suspect: "Madness", ran one of his most quoted aphorisms, "need not all be breakdown. It may also be breakthrough." If seen as a desperate way out of terrible dilemmas--particularly family ones--schizophrenia began to look less like a disease that strikes single sufferers than a family condition where one member happens to crack.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Laing's distrust of conventional methods began as an army psychiatrist in the early 1950s. At a mental hospital near Glasgow in 1953 he set up a "rumpus room" offering normally isolated or sedated psychotic patients a chance to interact. Later in London, and by then a name, he put his early ideas about schizophrenia into his best-known book, "The Divided Self" (1959). Five years later he opened Kingsley Hall in London's East End, an open hospital where doctors and sufferers were encouraged to swap roles. Laing, though, soon dissociated himself from the "anti-psychiatry" movement of his ex-colleague David Cooper, for whom all professional mental care was an instrument of repression.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Laing never took a settled view of schizophrenia. He explored it, philosophically, as an "existential crisis". He treated it, politically, as rebellion against duty and convention. Most fruitfully, he saw it as a symptom of family conflict. But partly because he changed his mind so often and partly because his style, at first polemical, became gnomic, Laing left no coherent body of ideas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since his time, the star of psychotherapy of all kinds has fallen. Psychiatric opinion, especially in America, looks to physical causes for mental disturbances. Yet, despite evidence that schizophrenia may be linked to the failure of the brain to grow properly in the womb, nobody yet really understands it. When, one day, biological explanations do arrive, Laing's insights will not be wiped out. To understand schizophrenia, he wrote, you have to understand despair. Before waffle and self-indulgence made him forget it, he saw that good doctoring takes more than test-results and drugs: empathy matters, too.

BEGINNINGS
<p>Ronald David Laing was born on October 7, 1927, and died on August 23, 1989. He is buried in Glasgow Cathedral, and his portrait hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. Laing was fiercely proud of his Scottish origins, and Scotland, on the whole, is proud of him. In the course of a colorful and turbulent life, Laing rose from somewhat unlikely beginnings to become the most controversial psychotherapist of the later twentieth century, with his books selling in the millions in more than twenty languages.</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s Laing influenced many people in diverse disciplines and walks of life. He was committed to the idea that psychotic episodes involve a willful or involuntary repudiation of a socially adapted "false self" and could lead to a more integrated and authentic mode of personal existence. Rather than stop or contain the process, Laing wanted to facilitate it-- free from the coercive sanctions that psychiatry imposes on regressive and irrational behavior. "Madness need not be all breakdown," he said. "It may also be breakthrough" (1970, p. 133).</p>
<p>Laing's forthright and articulate challenge's to conventional wisdom about the origins, meaning, and treatment of mental disturbances elicited angry condemnation from the bastions of medical orthodoxy. And though his contributions to contemporary thought and modern psychiatry were profound, his craving for fame and his need to take the role of guru contributed to the decline of his reputation as a serious thinker. Now that he is dead, there is a real danger that his tarnished public image will detract from an ongoing discussion and evaluation of his work. That would be a tragic mistake. Judging from anecdotes told by his friends, family, and colleagues, Laing was a study in sharp and bewildering contrasts. At different times and in different ways, he was by turns disciplined and debauched, self-effacing and arrogant, gentle and belligerent, shy and exhibitionist, empathic and self-centered, intensely emotional or profoundly cerebral. He had a rare sensitivity to those in acute mental distress, and an impish, ungovernable need to shock and offend those he considered dulled by convention. One of his associates, Leon Redler, remarks:</p>
<p><ul> Those of us who met Ronnie can testify that such meetings were fundamentally (and paradoxically) without supports, unpredictable, disturbing, heartening, inspiring, awe-ful and/or awful. There was enhanced possibility of what he and we once called "authentic meeting" . . . </ul> Ronnie had a quite an other effect on people, an effect coming, unpredictably, from elsewhere. Like the "pharmacon" in Plato's texts, it perhaps remains undecidable in any instance, whether this effect was remedy and/or poison. Or indeed, whether or not he was a pharmakeus, a kind of magician, a character no logic can confine within a non-contradictory definition. Or a pharmakos, a rascal, a contaminated and contaminating agent, to be expelled, in one way or another. (Redler, 1989) </ul>

The last we heard of R.D. Laing (1927-1989), he was arriving at lectures
addled with hashish and brandy, and promoting "rebirthing" techniques to treat
prenatal psychological trauma. Reflecting on this sad spectacle that Laing left
the world, we are likely to forget that he was one of the most influential and
controversial psychiatrists of the twentieth century, whose books sold in the
millions in more than twenty languages. Even at the height of his power,
however, Ronald Laing was a mystery, a man of many contradictions, and it is
this mystery that The Wing of Madness explores, searching out both the
remarkable story of Laing's life and the lasting significance of his work.
<p>Daniel Burston chronicles Laing's meteoric rise to fame as one of the first media psycho-gurus of the century, and his spiraling decline in the late seventies and eighties. Here are the successes: Laing's emergence as a unique voice on the psychiatric scene with his firs book, The Divided Self, in 1960; his forthright and articulate challenges to conventional wisdom on the origins, meaning, and treatment of mental disturbances; his pioneering work on the families of schizophrenics, Sanity, Madness and the Family (coauthored with A.Esterson). Here as well are Laing's more dubious moments, personal and professional, including the bizarre experiment with psychotic patients at Kingsley Hall. Burston traces many of Laing's controversial ideas and therapeutic innovations to a difficult childhood and adolescence in Glasgow and troubling experiences as an army doctor; he also offers a measured assessment of these ideas and techniques.</p>
<p>The R. D. Laing who emerges from these pages is a singular combination of skeptic and visionary, an original thinker whose profound contradictions have eclipsed the true merit of his work. In telling his story, Burston gives us an unforgettable portrait of an anguished human being and, in analyzing his work, recovers Laing's achievement for posterity. </p>

<p><b>A history of risk</b></p>
<h2>Dicey</h2><ul> <li><a href="11ex342.html">A<font size=-1>GAINST</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> G<font size=-1>ODS</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Peter Bernstein. <br>
</ul>

<p>IN ANOTHER writer's hands, a history of risk might be a banal, dull affair. It might even be intimidating, for it is hard to imagine any useful discussion of risk without some mention of brain-stretching concepts. Peter Bernstein, however, steers skilfully away from both banality and intimidation. Complex ideas are dextrously handled, neatly explained and clearly elucidated in their broader intellectual context.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Probability is a case in point. After sprinting in ancient Greece, the mathematics of risk made slow progress. It was not until the 17th century that a few profound problems in the mathematics of probability were solved, notably in a famous correspondence between Blaise Pascal and the Chevalier de M&#233;r&#233;, an inveterate gambler. After their insights were buttressed by Pierre de Fermat, a French mathematician, and Gottfried von Leibniz, a German philosopher, it was possible to calculate answers to previously intractable questions--for instance, how should the pot be divided in a game of chance which ends prematurely with one player ahead? That simple challenge stymied generations of mathematicians. Its eventual solution was a significant breakthrough.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, Mr Bernstein suggests that the inability of mathematicians to formulate rigorous answers to such questions about risk had been a profound hindrance to commerce. Society needed reliable rules on how risks and rewards should be shared between parties under different outcomes in the future. Once it obtained them during the 19th century, courtesy of a few more creative thinkers and statisticians, contract-based exchanges of goods and services boomed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where fixed rules apply, as in many games and a few businesses, probability is an indispensable risk-management tool. Without it, would-be players cannot fix reliable odds, so are less likely to participate. However, as Mr Bernstein explains, there is much more to risk than mere probability. As Frank Knight, an economist, famously pointed out earlier this century, there is a necessary distinction between known risks and uncertainty.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Known risks can be measured by using probability. Uncertainty is trickier because nobody knows what will happen in future, and it is necessary to resort to less precise tools. In finance, for instance, modern portfolio theory is based upon the simple idea that diversification produces returns for less absolute investment risk--ie, combinations of financial instruments are less risky than concentrations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If there is a weakness in this excellent book it is in the final section. Mr Bernstein describes recent advances in thinking about risk. He notes that risk-sharing mechanisms have become astonishingly common, thanks in part to innovations such as derivatives--the futures and options which seem regularly to be blamed for this bank's collapse and that firm's embarrassment. Yet he is reluctant to place current advances in the same league as those of the past, and even suspects that risk management has run out of control because people are putting blind faith in formulae.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That judgment is strange, if only because Mr Bernstein has made admirably clear that over the centuries the progress of risk management has been uneven. Hence, he should perhaps view recent business problems, such as those experienced by Barings and Bankers Trust, in a longer time-frame than he does.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He should also perhaps be more aware of, and more enthusiastic about, today's flowering of thinking about risk. Heavy-duty computers and the arrival into finance of hundreds of top-notch mathematicians have made risk management more than ever a numbers game. By thinking about the future, and imagining different outcomes which are then assigned probabilities, risk managers are creating new ways to reduce uncertainty.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result of better pricing and sharing of risk is widespread and inflation-free economic benefits. Mr Bernstein's endorsement of past triumphs makes his caution about the present an intriguing ending. But it scarcely mars a book which deserves to be, and surely will be, widely read.

The Winds of the Greeks and the Role of the Dice
<p>Why is the mastery of risk such a uniquely modern concept? Why did humanity wait the many thousands of years leading up to the Renaissance before breaking down the barriers that stood in the way of measuring and controlling risk?</p>
<p>These questions defy easy answers. But we begin with a clue. Since the beginning of recorded history, gambling--the very essence of risktaking--has been a popular pastime and often an addiction. It was a game of chance that inspired Pascal and Fermat's revolutionary breakthrough into the laws of probability, not some profound question about the nature of capitalism or visions of the future. Yet until that moment, throughout history, people had wagered and played games without using any system of odds that determines winnings and losings today. The act of risk-taking floated free, untrammeled by the theory of risk management.</p>
<p>Human beings have always been infatuated with gambling because it puts us head-to-head against the fates, with no holds barred. We enter this daunting battle because we are convinced that we have a powerful ally: Lady Luck will interpose herself between us and the fates (or the odds) to bring victory to our side. Adam Smith, a masterful student of human nature, defined the motivation: "The overweening conceit which the greater part of men have of their own abilities [and] their absurd presumption in their own good fortune." Although Smith was keenly aware that the human propensity to take risk propelled economic progress, he feared that society would suffer when that propensity ran amuck. So he was careful to balance moral sentiments against the benefits of a free market. A hundred and sixty years later, another great English economist, John Maynard Keynes, agreed: "When the capital development of a country becomes the by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done."</p>
<p>Yet the world would be a dull place if people lacked conceit and confidence in their own good fortune. Keynes had to admit that "If human nature felt no temptation to take a chance . . . there might not be much investment merely as a result of cold calculation." Nobody takes a risk in the expectation that it will fail. When the Soviets tried to administer uncertainty out of existence through government fiat and planning, they choked off social and economic progress. </p>

In this unique exploration of the role of risk in our society, Peter Bernstein
argues that the notion of bringing risk under control is one of the central ideas
that distinguishes modern times from the more distant past. Against the Gods, a
narrative that reads like a novel, chronicles the remarkable intellectual
adventure that liberated humanity from the oracles and soothsayers by means of
the powerful tools of risk management that are available to us today. This is a
richly-woven tale of Greek philosophers and Arab mathematicians, of
merchants and scientists, gamblers and philosophers, world-renowned intellects
and obscure but inspired amateurs who helped discover the modern methods of
putting the future at the service of the present, replacing helplessness before the
fates with choice and decision.
<p>When investors buy stocks, surgeons perform operations, engineers design bridges, entrepreneurs launch new businesses, astronauts explore the heavens, and politicians run for office, risk is their inescapable partner. Yet their actions reveal that risk today need not be feared: managing risk has become synonymous with challenge and opportunity.</p>
<p>Bernstein presents fascinating vignettes of such towering intellects as Omar Khayyam, Pascal and Bernoulli, Bayes and Keynes, Markowitz and Arrow, and Gauss, Galton and von Neumann. With his engaging literary style, he clarifies the concepts of probability, sampling, regression to the mean, game theory, and rational versus irrational decision making. The final sections of the book raise important questions about the role of the computer, the relationship between facts and subjective beliefs, the impact of chaos theory, the role of the burgeoning markets for derivatives, and the looming dominance of numbers. Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk is that rare book that turns the most profound issues of our time into pure reading pleasure. </p>

<p><b>Cookery</b></p>
<h2>Kitchen bible</h2><ul> <li>S<font size=-1>TAND</font> F<font size=-1>ACING</font> <font size=-1>THE</font> S<font size=-1>TOVE</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Anne Mendelson.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <i>Henry Holt; 474 pages; $29.95</i> <br>
</ul>

<p>KNOWN widely as "Mrs Rombauer" after its first author, "The Joy of Cooking" is as American as key lime pie. Its genesis, as told in this absorbing tale, is in one respect distinctly un-American. In a nation that values training and qualifications above much else, the classic cookbook was created by a woman with no experience as a writer and not much interest in food, then garnished by her similarly ill-qualified daughter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Irma Rombauer, a pillar of the German-American community in St Louis, started collecting recipes in her late 40s, to give herself something to do after her husband shot himself. In 1931 she had the first version of the book published at her own expense. After hawking it around publishers for a few years, she cajoled the Indianapolis-based Bobbs-Merrill to bring out an expanded edition in 1936.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite rows and litigation between author and publisher, which often threatened to sink the enterprise, sales took off during the war and by the 1950s it was a bestseller. When Mrs Rombauer died the spatula passed to her daughter, Marion Rombauer Becker. The last edition Mrs Becker worked on--published in 1975, a year before her death--is still in print and a new version is due out next year. Since 1936 more than 9m copies have been sold.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The author of this dual biography, an authority on the history of cookbooks, shows how, by luck or calculation, each new edition managed to anticipate the latest twist in America's stormy love affair with its stomach. In 1936 Mrs Rombauer was the first to recognise the role of canned and prepared foods--especially condensed soups--in the creation of quick and tasty dishes. She also dispensed with daunting lists of ingredients at the beginning of recipes, introducing them instead as they occur in the cooking. Along with aphorisms woven into the text, these innovations made the book more digestible than the stern instructional manuals of the time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs Becker was attracted by theories about nutrition and moved away from her mother's penchant for manufactured foods, trumpeting natural ingredients just before they became fashionable. Diehards complained she had replaced much of the book's folksy joy with a more preachy tone, but again she was abreast of the times: people may be cooking less, but when they do they take it seriously and like to think it is doing them good.

<p><b>History of navigation</b></p>
<h2>Like clockwork</h2><ul> <li><a href="10ex314.html">L<font size=-1>ONGITUDE</font>.</a>&nbsp;  By Dava Sobel. <br>
</ul>



<p>IT IS hard to decide which Dava Sobel has done better: explaining a vital technical breakthrough clearly or bringing alive a musty chapter from 18th-century navigational history. Most readers would not turn to marine chronometry for excitement. But Ms Sobel tells her historical detective story through the lives and machinations of a small set of characters. She writes on the whole well-turned prose and has an eye for detail. The result is a vivid tale of folly, heroism and banditry that happens to be true.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The book has a geographical title, but is really about clocks. Longitude (the up-down lines on maps) measures your distance east or west. To mariners, longitude amounts to time and time to longitude. As ships sailed west, their navigators watched the sun rise later and later (by Greenwich time). An accurate clock would have told them how far west they were. Unfortunately, the clocks of the age of sail were poor: the best of them were incurably seasick the moment ships cast off. Hundreds of men drowned for want of exact longitude.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Harrison, an unschooled Yorkshire carpenter, toiled for over 40 years at inventing exquisite clocks. Better at timepieces than setpieces, he wrote, in Ms Sobel's words, "with the scrivener's equivalent of marbles in the mouth". This lack of eloquence may have cost him dear. The Board of Longitude, an official committee, had promised a fortune to the inventor who could solve shipping's most urgent problem. Despite some initial support, Harrison failed for years to shake the doubts of the majority on the Board of Longitude as to his master-work's utility.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The astronomer royal, Nevil Maskelyne, an evil fellow as Ms Sobel tells it, was the most powerful sceptic on the Board of Longitude. Like most learned men of the time he thought that the only feasible way to fix longitude was by very precise observations of the sun, moon and stars. He was wrong but reluctant to admit it, and thereby hangs a complex tale of geography, astronomy and clockmaking, all of it admirably and clearly told by Ms Sobel. An accurate and rugged timepiece that could keep time through the worst weather and which would allow mariners to clock their local noon--and work out their distance from Greenwich--was perfectly possible as Harrison vainly insisted. He had, indeed, invented one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Maskelyne was convinced that no clock was up to the job and that the answer must lie in exacting shipboard observation of the heavens (followed by hours of laborious calculation). From his position as the Board technical arbiter, he thwarted Harrison at every turn. In the end--ah, but even though this is supposed to be history, and you all have wristwatches, and the Global Positioning System can fix your longitude to the nearest metre, it seems a shame to give the ending away.

<p><b>Extract</p></b>
Once on a Wednesday excursion when I was a little girl, my father bought me a
beaded wire ball that I loved. At a touch, I could collapse the toy into a flat coil
between my palms, or pop it open to make a hollow sphere. Rounded out, it
resembled a tiny Earth, because its hinged wires traced the same pattern of
intersecting circles that I had seen on the globe in my schoolroom--the thin
black lines of latitude and longitude. The few colored beads slid along the wire
paths haphazardly, like ships on the high seas.
<p>My father strode up Fifth Avenue to Rockefeller Center with me on his shoulders, and we stopped to stare at the statue of Atlas, carrying Heaven and Earth on his.</p>
<p>The bronze orb that Atlas held aloft, like the wire toy in my hands, was a see- through world, defined by imaginary lines. The Equator. The Ecliptic. The Tropic of Cancer. The Tropic of Capricorn. The Arctic Circle. The prime meridian. Even then I could recognize, in the graph-paper grid imposed on the globe, a powerful symbol of all the real lands and waters on the planet.</p>
<p>Today, the latitude and longitude lines govern with more authority than I could have imagined forty odd years ago, for they stay fixed as the world changes its configuration underneath them--with continents adrift across a widening sea, and national boundaries repeatedly redrawn by war or peace.</p>
<p>As a child, I learned the trick for remembering the difference between latitude and longitude. The latitude lines, the parallels, really do stay parallel to each other as they girdle the globe from the Equator to the poles in a series of shrinking concentric rings. The meridians of longitude go the other way: They loop from the North Pole to the South and back again in great circles of the same size, so they all converge at the ends of the Earth. </p>

LONGITUDE
<p>DAVA SOBEL</p>
<p>Anyone alive in the eighteenth century would have known that "the longitude problem" was the thorniest scientific dilemma of the day--and had been for centuries. Lacking the ability to measure their longitude, sailors thoughout the great ages of exploration had been literally lost at sea as soon as they lost sight of land. Thousands of lives, and the increasing fortunes of nations, hung on a resolution.</p>
<p>The quest for a solution had occupied scientists and their patrons for the better part of two centuries when, in 1714, Parliament upped the ante by offering a king's ransom (&#163;20,000) to anyone whose method or device proved successful. Countless quacks weighed in with preposterous suggestions. The scientific establishment throughout Europe--from Galileo to Sir Isaac Newton--had mapped the heavens in both hemispheres in its certain pursuit of a celestial answer. In stark contrast, one man, John Harrison, dared to imagine a mechanical solution--a clock that would keep precise time at sea, something no clock had at be ever been able to do on land.</p>
<p>Longitude is the dramatic human story of an epic scientific quest, and of Harrisons forty-year obsession with building his perfect timekeeper, known today as the chronometer. Full of heroism and chicanery, brilliance and the absurd, it is also a fascinating brief history of astronomy, navigation, and clockmaking. Through Dava Sobel's consummate skill, Longitude will open a new window on our world for all who read it. </p>

<h2>When virtually lost is really lost</h2>

<p><b>Remember how technology was going to free you from wandering around lost in strange places? That was then. "Virtual worlds" in 3-D are now. </b></p><ul></ul>

<p>SIDEWINDER and Zlite are doing a little dance. They look more or less alike: two male caricatures, little more than thick stick figures on a screen. They circle each other on what appears to be some sort of plaza in Alphaworlds, a three-dimensional "virtual" meeting place on the Internet. Sidewinder is the "avatar", or computer persona, of a computer salesman in the Philippines. Zlite is that of a writer sitting at his desk in London.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason the writer and the salesman, thousands of miles apart, are steering their little stick men around each other says a lot about the practical realities of such virtual worlds: they are trying not to be rude. Because their avatars look like people, it feels odd for them not to face each other while the two men's (mis)typed conversation appears in thought balloons over their heads.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the avatars are also the men's eyes in this world, and they want to see what is going on. So the Londoner slides Zlite sideways a bit to peer over Sidewinder's virtual shoulder as they talk, trying not to offend him. Then Sidewinder does the same, but goes a bit too far, so the two men slide back. Their typing, never good, is getting worse as they fuss with their mice to steer their little proxies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alphaworlds is one of the many <font size=-1>3-D</font> worlds sprouting up on the Internet these days. They all try to merge the popular chat channels and the text-only virtual worlds with the <font size=-1>3-D</font> graphic environments first seen in games such as Doom. Indeed, many <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s have adopted the <font size=-1>3-D</font> interface for everything from displaying art (in a "virtual museum") to providing a menu for video clips (presented as "rooms" behind doors that must be walked to and opened to start playback).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this virtual-worlds stuff excites the cyberspace dreamers, largely because <font size=-1>3-D</font> worlds sound a lot like the "Metaverse" described in Neuromancer, the seminal sci-fi novel by William Gibson that coined the phrase "cyberspace". They think that enthusiasts will not only soon navigate the Internet just as they now steer the bloodthirsty Marine through Doom, but also use their <font size=-1>PC</font>s and networks at work in the same way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These are clearly people with a lot of time on their hands. Anybody who has spent more than a few minutes in <font size=-1>3-D</font> environments (besides games, where wasting time is the point) has quickly discovered what is wrong with them: they have reinvented everything that is wrong with the real world, but made it a thousand times slower and more clumsy. In seeking to capture what works well in the real world (spatial relations), designers have too often kept what does not (trudging through places you do not want to be to get where you want to go).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, <font size=-1>3-D</font> interfaces sound like a natural enough idea. After all, our senses have been tuned over millions of years to understand the real world. People remember where things are and how to get there more easily than they remember what those things are called or the names of the roads on the route. Navigating through computer images that look a bit like the roads, halls and paths of the real word seems easier than picking abstract words from on-screen lists. Graphic "desktops" on <font size=-1>PC</font>s make the same assumption. By adopting cartoons of real-world objects, such as rubbish bins and folders, they provide a metaphor that suggests what on-screen objects do and how to work them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now the computer industry is taking the next step. The latest personal computers have just enough power to add a third dimension (and, critically, motion, without which <font size=-1>3-D</font> is no more than a static perspective drawing) with quality high enough to make things recognisable and at a frame-rate fast enough to give the illusion of motion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Games like Doom demonstrate the effectiveness of <font size=-1>3-D</font> spaces almost too well; as a player navigates the dark halls and alien landscapes, always just a turn away from bumping into some fanged beast, things become really creepy. But then the whole point of the game is to wander aimlessly, bumping into things. The same model works less well when you are trying to get some work done.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Doom's successor, Quake, is a good example of the <font size=-1>3-D</font> interface taken too far. In Doom one chooses which difficulty level to play at by picking from a menu (from "I'm too young to die" to "Ultraviolence"). In Quake, the designers have adopted a "virtual menu" that involves walking down several halls and then climbing one ramp or another to choose the level. In Doom the process took perhaps a second; in Quake it is a few minutes. What was wrong with the text menu? Nothing, but it wasn't <font size=-1>3-D</font>, and apparently therefore simply too retro to stay.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three snags bug <font size=-1>3-D</font> today. First, although the software does a relatively good job of simulating a <font size=-1>3-D</font> world on a <font size=-1>2-D</font> screen, the steering devices--usually a computer mouse or joystick--have a harder time making the leap. A mouse is intrinsically a <font size=-1>2-D</font> device, rolling around on its pad: up and down gives it fits. The third dimension can be faked but so far only in ways that are hardly intuitive. Free-floating mice are available, but you feel silly waving something that looks like a bar of soap in the air. The idea of walking one way and looking another--so natural in the real world--is hard to simulate without risking repetitive-strain injury.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second problem is that animated <font size=-1>3-D</font> graphics cannot yet give reality a run for its money. One way of measuring the fidelity of animated computer graphics is in the number of polygons (the geometric rudiments out of which complex objects are built) they can display per second. Ted Nelson, an early virtual-reality pioneer, once calculated that a computer that could display 18 billion polygons per second might be able to approximate the look of the real world. Today's best computers can reach about 500,000 polygons per second, or 36,000 times too few.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So it may be decades before the ideas behind today's clumsy <font size=-1>3-D</font> spaces work as well as they do in their designers' minds. In the meantime, designers might use <font size=-1>3-D</font> only where it works best--representing complex data with lots of variables, for example. This will usually mean sticking with <font size=-1>2-D</font> where people are trying to get something done. Or even, daring as it may be, rediscovering the charms of text. In the effort to bring the subtleties of reality--personality, emotion, mood--to cyberspace, the old adage is reversed: a word is worth a thousand pictures. Try representing "she smirks" in polygons.

<h2>Hybrid CD-ROMs</h2>
<h4>Will today's discs soon be yesterday's technology?</h4><ul></ul>

<p>IT IS somehow typical of the computer industry that just as the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> becomes standard equipment on virtually all new <font size=-1>PC</font>s, multimedia geeks get ready to sign its death warrant. The shiny disc's crime: limited capacity and static content. Compared with the infinite riches of the Internet, even the half-billion bytes on a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> look puny. Worse still, the data on a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> are frozen once they are zapped into the disc's plastic layers; the data on the Internet, by contrast, change constantly. Use of the Internet is booming; America's second-largest chain of <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> shops is going out of business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the Internet makes a fool of multimedia <font size=-1>PC</font> owners, too. The simple pictures and scratchy sounds that can be carried down a telephone line look pathetic on a <font size=-1>PC</font> with a screen to rival the best television sets and a sound system powerful enough to shake the walls. The Web may contain a lot of information, and the same sort of video and sound that makes <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s shine, but it can take hours to get it through the modems to your computer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faced with this bad choice, creators of multimedia content usually grimace and then opt either to stick with dated and limited material on a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> or to stifle the video and sound on the Web. But an emerging middle ground combines these two extremes. So-called hybrid <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s supply the multimedia foundations on the disc but freshen up their offerings with links to a parallel Web site.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most obvious candidates for this medium-straddling feat are multimedia encyclopedias; they need the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> for the video and sound that distinguishes them from paper encyclopedias, but depend on Web links to reflect the world of the moment. Other candidates include electronic magazines, catalogues and reference works ranging from medical manuals to baseball guides for sports nuts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;InfoTech, a market research firm based in Vermont, thinks an increasing number of hybrids--from 311 titles in 1995 to 720 this year--will in future blend home entertainment and education software. But most of the hybrids now on the market that try to perform this trick are disappointing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Solar System Explorer", a new <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> from Maxis, is an example. As a stand-alone title, it is not much fun: it seeks to combine earnest technical data and a thin veneer of sci-fi fantasy. Buried in its menus, though, is an "Internet" button, which calls up your standard Web browser and points it to a site Maxis set up with space-science updates, such as the recent launch of a new mission to Mars. Unfortunately, this extra information looks quite unlike the material on the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> (for instance, it dispenses entirely with the navigate-around-a-spaceship metaphor).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft's "Encarta 96" makes a better case for hybrids: it has an on-line "yearbook builder" that adds updates, by means of icons and Web links, to articles on the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> version, though not automatically. The feature has more to do with salesmanship than the birth of a new medium. By highlighting the hybrid's ability to add immediacy to an otherwise static reference work, it encourages customers to buy a "subscription" to the encyclopedia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ultimately, hybrids seem likely to remain a niche market. Although any Web site could distribute a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> to embellish its sparer on-line offering with multimedia flash, few seem inclined to do so. Accessing the Web is hard enough without adding further complications. The few <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s that are designed to complement the Web mostly hold a library of commonly visited Web sites and categories, which makes finding information on-line easier.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of the on-line shopping malls that tried to combine a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> catalogue with on-line ordering have dropped these efforts to make the viewing of products more like the effortless process of leafing through a paper catalogue and less like a series of slow downloads. Customers did not use them enough to justify the cost of distributing the discs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Making <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s that really rise above the multimedia available on the Web itself is a tough and expensive business. In the end, whizzy <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> multimedia (improved by a coming generation of higher-capacity discs) and the Web will probably stay as distinct markets, one for entertainment, the other for information, at least until the typical home has a fast Internet connection of its own. That day is in the ever-distant future. For now, shiny discs have a few more spins in them yet.

<H2>Search <i>The Economist</i>  Web site</h2>

This form allows you to search the editorial content of <EM>The Economist</EM> (extracts from each week's edition, the review of books and multimedia, and surveys) available on the Web site. Entire back issues of the newspaper are not stored on the site. Simply type in words you want to look for. You will probably get more accurate results if you use two, three or four words rather than just one.
<P>For example, if you wanted to find out about the growth of regulation in America, you might type:<p>

<TT>america regulation growth</tt>

<h1><center><font color="#003400">What is Adobe PDF?</font></center></h1><hr width=75% align=center size=2>



This new file format allows designers the ability to create stunning interactive brochures over the internet, intranet, and cd-roms without losing the original format of the document.  What is the benefit of this technology?  First, it is platform independent.  This means that people can view the same document using different computers and operating systems (Windows, Mac, Unix, Sun).  Secondly, no reauthoring or conversion is necessary. Best of all, PDF files look exactly like
the original documents, complete with fonts, graphics, images, and page layout.  Go <a href="index.html">Back</a> a page and try it out!<br><br><br>

Cornament decorative corn is the result of man working with nature to produce an expression of artful coloration, using native America's oldest source of  food as a canvas.  While no two ears of corn are identical, through the science of genetic engineering, Cornament is able to offer you the ability to select predictable kernel colorations and ear-size choices -- each adorned with a complementary handcrafted or natural ornamentation.

<center>SIMON STALLWOOD - ABOUT THE ARTIST</center>
<FONT SIZE=-1><blockquote><I>As golf increases in popularity world-wide, similarly the demand for golfing paintings and prints continues to increase.  Foremost in this field is Simon Stallwood, himself a low handicap golfer and one of Britain's leading young sporting artists.  Following successful exhibitions in the United Kingdom, and regular trips to America to paint some of the world's most famous and scenic courses, Stallwood has received a number of major commissions, most recently from Sheikh Mohammed to paint the Emirates Golf Club in Dabai.  He also makes frequent trips to Japan, with prestigious commissions from both leaders of industry and some of the country's most exclusive golf clubs.  His paintings and prints are also much in demand among non-golfers, who relish his eye for detail, and appreciate them simply for their landscape qualities.

<font color="071179" size=-1>This hefty <strong>"Class-in-a-Box"</strong> is really three things in one.<br><br>
<strong>First</strong>, it a complete training course in sponge and rag work and basic <em>faux marble</em>.<br><br>
<strong>Second</strong>, a video is matched with a detailed <em>book</em> which reviews each technique.  Clear and easy to understand.<br><br>
<strong>Finally</strong>, the box contains all basic supplies for the craft.  It contains a half-gallon of <em>Fauxtex Sponging Glaze </em>which will do two or three rooms!  This is a wonderful clear acrylic medium which is tinted with very small amounts of craft paint (or house paint).  Also included is variety of<em> natural sea sponges</em>, large and small, and two square yards of professional <em>rag rolling material</em>. The box even includes practice<em> paint</em> and <em>feathers</em> for veining the marble.<br><br><center><img src="fauxline.gif" width=200 height=4></center></center>

<strong>Faux Finishing for Fun And Profit</strong><br>
This came as a pleasant surprise to the professionals who put this training/supply box together - quite a number of retailers have used the teaching system as the basis for a highly popular and profitable two-hour training <em>workshop</em> in their stores, <em>based on the video</em>.  Others hold classes in their homes.  It's a natural for any retailer selling small bottles of acrylic craft paint.<br><br><center><img src="fauxline.gif" width=200 height=4></center><br>
The price of the <strong>"Class-in-a-Box"</strong>  ($69.95 + UPS Shipping Charges) is less than the cost of wallpapering a bathroom and it could start a whole new career.<br><br><center><img src="fauxline.gif" width=200 height=4></center><br><br>

Pewabic earned a national reputation for its beautiful tile commissions and its famous iridescent glazes, and became an important feature of many homes and institutions around the country.  Among many commissions were the Christ Church, Cranbrook; the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, Washington, D.C; Detroit's Guardian Building, Public Library, Institute of Arts, Holy Redeemer Church, and countless homes, churches and institutions.

<TR><TD width=200 align=left valign=top><FONT color=#FFFFFF SIZE=+1>ELEMENTS NEEDED:</FONT><BR><FONT color=#FFFFFF>As you prepare your files, ask yourself if you have the following job elements listed below to complete your job.<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Hard Copy Proof</STRONG><BR>
A properly marked up 100% laser copy proof should be submitted with all incoming files. Tile your output, if needed, and tape it together.
<LI><STRONG>Fonts</STRONG><BR>
Remember to list the names of all fonts used in your document and to include printer and screen fonts on the disk. NOTE: TrueType fonts may cause unexpected problems. Stick with Postscript fonts whenever possible.
<LI><STRONG>Graphic Elements</STRONG><BR>
It is extremely important to include all copies of graphics on the disk (EPS, TIFF, etc). List the graphic names on the digital work order with the application and version used to create them.
<LI><STRONG>Don't forget:</STRONG><BR>
A hard copy of all art needed to be scanned (photos, transparencies, reflective art, logos, line art). Clearly indicate on the hard copy proof where they should be placed in the document.
</OL>
</FONT><BR></TD><TD width=75></TD>

<TD width=400 align=left valign=top><H2>DO's and Dont's:</H2>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG>NESTING</STRONG><BR>
Importing EPS files within an EPS file and importing it again into a page layout program is called nesting. Minimize the use of nesting because it can cause printing problems.
<LI><STRONG>Color Breaks</STRONG><BR>
Verify all and ONLY the colors used in the document and make sure the color scans/artwork are set correctly.<BR>Set CMYK values for process color printing only.<BR>Set PMS colors for spot color printing.
<LI><STRONG>What you see is <U>NOT</U> what you get</STRONG><BR>
Don't rely on your monitor to accurately represent ink on paper. When define colors, refer to a Standard Pantone swatchbook for accurate hues or call your American Speedy representative for assistance.
<LI><STRONG>Documentation</STRONG><BR>
List the name and version of your software program. Your document set up size should be the same as the final trim size (if not, indicate percentage to be printed and include a finished sized laser print). Properly label your disk <IMG SRC="am04.gif" ALIGN=right>(Syquest cartridge or floppy) with your name, address and phone number. Please indicate what is included.

<strong><center>HOW ARE CLINICAL AND "REGULAR" MASSAGE DIFFERENT?</center></strong>
<hr width=60%>
Musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction can be treated by using the body's built-in release mechanisms.  While all massage procedures can be beneficial when properly applied, the clinical massage therapist uses very specific dysfunctions.<p>
<hr width=60%>
<strong><center>WHAT TYPES OF DYSFUNCTIONS ARE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH CLINICAL MASSAGE?</center></strong>
<hr width=60%>
<strong><font size=+5>M</font>yofascial Pain and Dysfunction</strong>-- pain and/or physiological dysfunction originating from identifiable points within muscles and their facial tissues.  These locations are known as trigger points because they often trigger distant reactions.<br><br>
Former White House Physician, Janet Travell, MD, and others have developed extensive maps of such referred pain.  They have also identified nearly a hundred dysfunctions that can have myofascial trigger point origins.  Some of these are: carpel tunnel syndrome, TMJ dysfunction, PMS, headache, diarrhea, dizziness, cardiac arrhythmia, indigestion, tennis elbow, urinary frequency, sinusitis, deafness, and blurred vision.<br>
<strong><font size=+5>F</font>ascial Plane Dysfunction</strong>-- The body's own version of "Saran Wrap", fascia covers most of the body in large, continuous connected sheets.  Injury, postural patterns and chemical imbalances can cause these sheets to distort and bind themselves to nearby tissues.  Since all major blood vessels and nerves follow these fascial sheathes through the body, properly aligned and released fascia is vital to good health and the proper operation of the circulatory and nervous systems.<br>
<strong><font size=+5>N</font>euromuscular dysfunction</strong>-- The smallest muscular activity requires that countless nerve impulses be sent to the muscle to be activated and to all of the adjoining and opposing muscles.  As an example, in the simplest motion of flexing your elbow, you must tighten the biceps and other associated muscles while simultaneously relaxing the triceps and other associated muscles.  The combined nervous activity and muscular response must be precisely timed and exactly proportionate.<br>
For more complex movements like rotating the head or taking a breath, the amount of coordinating activity is multiplied astronomically.  Unfortunately, the mechanism responsible for such coordination can bread down and muscle fibers or whole muscles can actually lock in opposition to their normal activity.<br>
<strong><font size=+5>T</font>onus System Dysfunction</strong>-- When overused (either by a single, too strenuous effort or by extended, repetitive activity), muscles can lose their ability to understand how to relax.  Referred to as hypertonic, such muscles are overly tight, tend to harbor myofascial trigger points, and cause stress on the muscles that oppose them and the joints that they cross.<br>
<strong><font size=+5>D</font>ermatomic and Spondylogenic Dysfunctions</strong>--  If a nerve is pinched where it leaves the spine, or anywhere along its route, the area that nerve serves will feel pain.  Many people have experience such a problem with the sciatic nerve.  It originates in the low back, but when pinched can make the knee, shin, or heel hurt.  This is an example of dermatomic pain-- literally translated-- pain in an area of skin.<br>
Spondylogenic dysfunction occurs when the joints of the spine are compressed or otherwise impaired and cause their own special trigger point-type pain or dysfunction.<br>
Both of these are successfully treated with clinical massage by loosening the muscles and other soft tissue that surrounds the affected joint or nerve.<br><center><br><img src="clin0661.gif"></center></td>

<strong><center>WHAT ARE THE PROCEDURES USED IN CLINICAL MASSAGE?</center></strong>
<hr width=60%>
Massage therapists trained in clinical massage can use a variety of body work procedures appropriate to the person/condition being treated.  Most of these procedures will involve releasing the body from a dysfunctional holding pattern that has developed as the result of the client's accommodating to a recent or old injury or misuse.  Among these procedures are:
<dl>
<dt><strong><font size=+5>N</font>euromuscular/myofascial therapy--</strong>
<dd> a method of carefully searching for and treating ischemic locations and the trigger points that are often the key factors in chronic and severe pain.  This type of therapy is widely acclaimed and extremely successful in pain relief.
<dt><strong><font size=+5>F</font>ascial release--</strong>
<dd> very gentle, subtle manipulation of the fascial planes to release and normalize fascial sheathes.  Because the subtleties of this therapy require a well-trained , sensitive therapist, few patients have previously been able to experience its benefits.
<dt><strong><font size=+5>P</font>ositional release--</strong>
<dd>a very gentle release wherein the dysfunctional part is place in a position of complete, pain-free relaxation and allowed to normalize its function during a 90 second period or neuromuscular reorganization.
<dt><strong><font size=+5>P</font>ost-isometric muscle release--</strong>
<dd>gently facilitated joint movement to assist a muscle in regaining a normal, relaxed length.  The client actively participates.
<dt><strong><font size=+5>E</font>nergy release--</strong>
<dd>passive touch used in such a manner as to help the client's nervous system release and normalize dysfunctional holding patterns.
<dt><strong><font size=+5>S</font>wedish massage--</strong>
<dd>a systematic application of procedures known to enhance circulation of blood and lymph (among other benefits).
</dl>
<hr width=60%>
<strong><center>WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM CLINICAL THERAPY?</center></strong>
<hr width=60%>
The procedures described in the preceding paragraphs are helpful for an incredible number of symptoms that arise when musculoskeletal problems exist.  It is impossible to list with any completeness the disorders that have been successfully treated.  Instead, we have listed below some general symptoms that may indicate muscular problems that can be treated, and which could be the unsuspected origins or serious physiological dysfunctions:
<em>
<ul>
<li>Any chronic muscle or joint pain.
<li>A known condition of referred pain, such as "when my neck gets tense I get a headache."
<li>Any recurring symptoms that seem to accompany or are precipitated by muscle tightness.
<li>Tight muscles that are limiting the mobility or a joint.
<li>Chronically fatigued muscles.
<li>Low energy level, especially when accompanied by muscle aches and pains.
<li>A recent muscle injury that generates pain or dysfunction in areas not seemingly involved in the injury.
<li>Any visceral dysfunction that tests negative for conventional causes.
<li>Muscle pain that recurs in an area with no apparent new cause.
<li>A tendency for pain to spread to other muscles whenever a simple strain or injury occurs.
</ul>
</em>
Massage Therapy is not a cure-all.  A competent therapist will advise you on its applicability to your symptoms.<br><br><center><a href="gloss.html">Glossary of Terms</a></center></td></tr></table></center><center><font size=+2><b>For More Information Call<br>810-478-8820</b></font></center>

the part that can be difficult. To 
help give you the cutting

NUTRITION has developed 
CUTS 11, a maximum potency fat 
fighting, and anti-water retention 
formula. CUTS 11 combines all of 
the natural fat metabolizers like 
L-Carnitine, Choline, lnositol, 
Lecithin, Linoleic Acid, Oleic 
Acid, and Methionine with 
anti-water retention herbs. Not 
only is CUTS 11 formulated to 
help you convert body fat into 
energy, it also helps eliminate 
excess water retention to bring 
out your hard earned 
muscularity. The high 
concentration of L-Carnitine 
helps move fat into the 
mitochondria where it can be 
turned into usable fuel. Our 
formula is also designed to help 
raise the High Density Lipo 
protein (HDL) levels in the 
bloodstream. HDL's are 
considered &quot;the good fats&quot;, 
helping to emulsify excessive 
accumulations of fats in the 
blood and liver. </font></p>

Foundations: <BR>
The Contemporary
Basement Alternative</FONT></STRONG><BR>
Say the word "basement" and what comes to mind?  Do you picture a damp, clammy cellar with a pantry, a seldom-used pool table, and empty space?
With a <STRONG>Permanent Wood Foundation</STRONG> in your new home, you'll paint an entirely different picture.  Wood foundations take the mustiness out of basements and create warm, comfortable living spaces that add a special dimension to your home.
</TABLE></center>

<HR WIDTH=75% ALIGN=center SIZE=2 NOSHADE>


</TD><BR><H2>A CLOSER LOOK</H2><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Permanent Wood Foundation system is an engineered construction system based on extensive laboratory and field testing.  It has been proven by years of successful use beneath thousands of homes and other structures throughout the U.S. and Canada.  And it is accepted by the major model building codes; by federal agencies; and by lending, home warranty and fire insurance institutions.
<STRONG>Permanent Wood Foundation</STRONG> walls are constructed like the wood-frame walls in the rest of your house with one important difference: the plywood and lumber components of Permanent Wood Foundation walls are pressure-treated with wood preservatives that become chemically bonded in the wood.  This pressure-preservative treating process protects the foundation from fungi, termites and other causes of decay ... permanently.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>P</FONT>ermanent Wood Foundation walls are engineered to absorb and distribute loads and stresses that frequently crack and split other types of foundations.  And they are designed to prevent the types of moisture problems that typically plague conventional basements by incorporating several integral moisture deflection and diversion features (see illustration).
The result?  Warm, dry, livable basements.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><CENTER>Materials</CENTER></FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT  SIZE=+2>O</FONT>nly the highest quality building materials are used for the Permanent Wood Foundation. Plywood must meet the strict requirements of U.S. Product Standard PS 1-83 for Construction and Industrial
Plywood.  Lumber must be of a species for which allowable unit stresses are given in the "National Design Specification" for Wood Construction<IMG SRC="pwfo05.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=171 ALIGN=right>and must be grademarked by an approved inspection agency.  And both plywood and lumber must be pressure-treated in accordance with the penetration, retention and drying requirements of the American Wood Preservers Association's Standard C-22.  Required preservative retention is 50 percent higher than codes require for normal ground contact application.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1>Structural and Durability Analyses</FONT></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Permanent Wood Foundation is the result of extensive design and engineering analyses by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, the National Forest Products Association, and the National Association of Home Builders Research Foundation.  Additional in-ground structural testing has been conducted by the American Plywood Association.  Durability of the system was demonstrated in long-term tests conducted by the Forest Service.  Pressure-preservative-treated wood in these tests has withstood severe decay and termite conditions with treatment levels lower than required by the AWPB standard for <STRONG>Permanent Wood Foundations.</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<TITLE>More Information on Reversing Heart Disease</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY background="hearbac.gif" text="990000">
<center><strong>More Information on Reversing Heart Disease:</strong></center><br>
<strong>Is reversal of Heart Disease Possible?</strong>
<p>	Over the last eight years numerous research studies have shown that heart blockages are reversible. Not only have cholesterol lowering medications been shown to reverse heart disease, but dietary modification has also been shown to be successful. The Heart Healing Plan is based on a successful program for reversing heart disease called The Downriver Reversal Team. The Downriver Reversal Team was started in 1992 in Metropolitan Detroit. Dr. Laman, the founder of the Heart Healing Plan was intimately involved in the Downriver Reversal Team. During the last five years hundreds of patients went through The Downriver Reversal team, and <strong>over 85% of the people who completed the program achieved stabilization or reversal of their heart blockages.</strong><br></p>
<p>The Heart Healing Plan adheres strictly to the principles shown to be successful in the Downriver Reversal Team. Dr. Laman founded this program on the idea that anyone can achieve reversal of heart disease. He based this on his own experience after watching many of his patients achieve reversal on their own. Dr. Laman realized that not everyone could attend special reversal centers. He designed the Heart Healing Plan to be simple enough to be followed at home. The Workbook that accompanies the Heart Healing Plan was specifically invented to be read in one sitting. Busy people often don't have the time to wade through lengthy material. Appropriate resources are included in the plan for people who need further information.<br></p>
<p>	All people who have heart disease can benefit from following a reversal program. People who have mild blockages and those people who have severe heart disease can all be helped Even if you have had a severe heart attack or have already had bypass surgery you can benefit from heart reversal. It's best to start the reversal process before serious blockages begin, but better late than never. Don't delay in making this important decision.<br></p>
<strong>Why do people get Heart Disease?</strong><br>
<p>	Heart disease occurs when cholesterol deposits build up inside the arteries of the heart shutting off the flow of blood. These cholesterol deposits are called plaques. Cholesterol plaques occur when the inside lining of the heart arteries become damaged. Once the opening of the arteries becomes severely reduced people begin to have chest pain or may develop a heart attack.<br></p>	
<p>No-one is completely certain what causes heart disease to develop. We do know that certain risk factors contribute to this condition. A risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease. Why certain individuals get heart disease, and not others, remains a mystery.<br></p>
<p>We do know that many risk factors can be modified to improve a persons chance of preventing heart disease. The Heart Healing Plan works to help you learn how to overcome the most important risk factors to prevent heart disease.<br></p>
<center><strong>Risk Factors for Heart Disease</strong></center>
<center><table width=300>
<tr>
<td>
Elevated serum cholesterol<br>	Low HDL cholesterol<br>	Heredity<br>	High blood pressure<br>	Diabetes<br></td>
<td>	Smoking<br>	Male Sex<br>	Physical inactivity<br>	Obesity<br>	High Triglycerides<br></td></tr></table></center><br>
<strong>Do I still need to take my heart medications while on the reversal program?</strong><br> 	<p>Yes! Even if you have started on the reversal program you should take your medications. We recommend that all people who have heart disease remain under their doctor's care. If you follow the reversal program very carefully there is a good chance that you may be able to get off many or most of your heart medications. Only your doctor should stop your medications.	<br></p>
<p>The Heart Healing Plan makes no guarantees about the success of this plan. Every person is different. Although most of the people who have followed reversal programs carefully are able to achieve excellent results, this plan can make no guarantees.</p><br>
<strong>How long does it take before reversal is achieved?</strong><br>
<p>	Amazingly,when people start on a reversal program they generally begin to see results in six weeks. In this short time many people notice a marked improvement in how they feel. Quite often their chest pain completely disappears, and their energy level improves. By the end of a year, most people have lost between 20-30 pounds of weight. The vast majority will have stabilized their coronary blockages and by the end of two years as many as 85% will have achieved stabilization or reversal of their blockages.<br></p>
<strong>How long will I need to be on the reversal program?</strong><br>
<p>	Although streaks of cholesterol can be seen even in the aortas of young people, symptoms of heart disease take many years to develop. What has taken a lifetime to form can't be quickly cured. People who have heart disease need to know that stopping its progression is a life long process. This is where <strong>bypass surgery and balloon </strong>angioplasty are misleading. Many people mistakenly believe that once the have these procedures then are cured. Nothing can be further from the truth. Bypass surgery and balloon angioplasty do not cure heart disease! They are temporary measures. They do not treat the underlying cause of heart disease. Only life style modification can truly cure heart disease. <em>Only a program such as The Heart Healing Plan can allow you to permanently take back your life.</em><br></p>
<strong>What is included in the The Heart Healing Plan?</strong>
	<ol>
<li>The Heart Healing Plan Workbook: a short easy to read text that describes why you should reverse heart disease. The Workbook is designed to be read in one sitting to start you quickly on the path to reversal. It details all the components of the Heart Healing Plants. Its chapters include: Yes! It works. Why You Need to Change, The Miracle Plan, The Low Fat Diet, Aerobic Exercise, Learning to Relax The Bits and Pieces, and Putting It All Together.
<li>"Witnesses to the Miracle"- A thirty minute long inspirational and instructional video. This videotape includes interviews with actual heart patients who have achieved reversal. You'll be inspired and moved as they tell their story about the road to reversal of heart disease.	
<li>"The Reversal Eating Plan"- a forty-five page instructional book that teaches you how to buy foods and what to eat. Written by Gerry Krag, MA, RD, dietitian for the reversal program, Ms. Krag has personally counseled hundreds of people in the reversal plan. Her practical and simple ideas will be invaluable as you begin to prepare low fat meals.	
<li>Fat Gram Counter: this handy fat gram counter is the one commonly used by reversal patients and includes over 500 foods.</ol><strong><center>About the Author</center> </strong>
<p>	Dr. Kirk Laman is a board certified cardiologist and a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology. For eight years Dr. Lawman has worked with heart patients as a practicing cardiologist. During this time he has watched hundreds of heart patients undergo bypass surgery and balloon angioplasty. Although many people were dramatically improved, the benefits were rarely permanent. Often patients needed repeat angioplasty and bypass as their heart disease worsened. Sadly, he watched many patients suffer through repeat procedures and end up dying.<br></p>
<p>	During this time an amazing treatment was discovered. Through the pioneering work of medical researchers it was proven that the progression of heart disease could be slowed In many people it could even be reversed. Lifestyle changes made it all possible. Patients who followed a strict plan of low fat eating, exercise, and relaxation could achieve astonishing reversal of their heart blockages. Their lives could be changed completely.<br></p>
<p>	In 1992, Dr. Laman's cardiology practice decided to form their own reversal program, a practical plan that could be followed by the average patient. <em>The Downriver Reversal Team</em> was created. The reversal team members adhered closely to reversal principles. In the months that followed they too showed that dramatic reversal of heart disease could be achieved by patients willing to make the necessary changes in their life style while following an inexpensive, simple plan.	<br></p>
<p>Although specialized heart programs like the Downriver Reversal Team have shown that people can stop heart disease, not everyone can attend those programs. No reason exits why patients can't learn these techniques at home. Because Dr. Laman has seen mans of his own patients achieve reversal at home he founded -The Heart Healing Plan.	<br></p>
<p>The Heart Healing Plan is a simple, easy to follows program for reversal of heart disease that can be followed at home. The Plan is designed to be short and easy to master.<br></p><center>Only<br><font size=+2><strong>$79.95</font></strong><br><font size=-1>plus $8.50 Shipping and Handling<br>Michigan residents add 6% sales tax</font><br><br><font size=+2>Order Hotline: </font><br><font size=+3>1-888-91-HEART</font></center>

<TITLE>The Company</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY background="logobac.gif" text="993408">
<center><img src="falc600.gif"></center>
<p><strong><blockquote><font size=+1>Falcon Golf Inc. has been one of America's foremost custom golf club makers for almost 25 years.  Founded in 1972, Falcon Golf, located in Southeast Michigan, has built an enviable reputation for providing high quality, premium priced, golf clubs.<br>
Recognized as an innovator in the golf club industry, Falcon was one of the very first to produce golf clubs with carbon graphite shafts.  Similarly, well before Ping created a mass market for cavity backed investment cast irons, Falcon worked with Tom Crow, the founder of Cobra Golf, on Falcon's first cast iron head.  Prior to developing their own manufacturing expertise, both Cobra Golf and the industry's leading graphite shaft producer, Aldila, used Falcon to manufacture their respective lines of branded woods.  Since 1972, Falcon has successfully developed and marketed five different iron models, the most recent-- the all new Falcon FATBOY.</font></blockquote><hr width=75%><br>
<center><img src="falclogo.gif"></center><br><blockquote><font size=+1>In 1993, inspired by the success of the oversize metal wood, Thad Gutowski, founder of Falcon Golf, began to experiment with an all new approach to iron head design.  After numerous prototypes, he created the FATBOY, an iron with a larger hollow head and unique weight distribution.  Unlike conventional clubs, which are cast in one piece, the patented FATBOY is precision cast in two pieces, which are joined together to create a much larger clubhead-- up to 27% larger than solid cast heads.  The FATBOY does for irons what metal did for woods-- it eliminated useless weight from inside the club head.  This breakthrough approach allows for significant redistribution of the clubhead's weight, not possible with a single piece casting.  The result is a unique and desirable ball action-- a slight controlled spin the moves the ball toward the target on off center hits, not <em>away</em> from it like conventional irons.  Extensive testing on "Iron Byron", the famous mechanical golfer, proved the FATBOY'S exceptional performance.</font></blockquote><br></strong>

<font size=+1><b><u><center>The Gear Effect</center></u></b></font>
<font size=-1>Looking at a driver, one notes that from heel to toe, the face is convex.  If the face were flat, and the ball was struck toward the toe of the club, the ball would not go right as one might expect, but spin counter-clockwise, and eventually end up far left of center.  Conversely, a ball struck towards the heel on a flat faced dirver spins clock-wise, ending up far right.  Through the years, clubmakers found they could reduce this undesirable ball action ("gear effect") by putting a radius on the club face, or "bulge" as it is called.  The amount of bulge a club requires is determined by the position of the center of gravity (CG) in the club head.  The farther the CG is back from the face, the more bulge is required.  Because the driver has the largers head, its CG is furthest from the face and the club requires the greatest bulge.  The bulge is reduced through the woods until, with irons, the CG is on the club face, and the club face is flat.<br><br>
However, because its face is flat a conventional iron, when struck on the toe, will go right, while a heel shot will go left.  With the FATBOY, Falcon repositioned the weight, moving the CG carefully back from the face.  Because the face remains flat,  Falcon developed a controlled gear effect.<br></font>

<strong><u>Industry Experts Applaud FATBOY</u></strong><br>
<p><font size=-1>Falcon USA had the FATBOY tested by Bob Bush, Golf Enterprises.  Bob Bush, for many years the technical director for True Temper, the world's leading shaft manufacturer, is the co-developer of the famous Iron Byron swing machine.  While the dispersion data from these tests are depicted to the right, his full report includes this statement:</font></p>
<em><blockquote><font size=-1>"I was very impressed with the performance of your new iron.  Watching the toe shots drow in toward the center and the heel shots fade to the center was impressive.  As you are aware most irons, when hit on the toe, move left to right and not back to center.  I believe you have an iron that can be a factor in the industry"</font>

The new breed of golf club manufacturing specialists have used technology and marketing to revive what had become a staid industry.  Over the past thirty years there have been four fundamental changes in the manufacture of golf clubs.
<ol>
<li>In the 1970's cavity-backed investment cast irons replaced the traditional forged iron
<li>Metal woods replaced persimmon in the early 1980's
<li>Later in the 1980's graphite replaced steel as the shaft material of choice
<li>In the 1990's, oversized is on the verge of replacing standard sized equipment

<td width=250 valign=middle>The real inside story on the hollow inside of the <strong>Falcon FATBOY! </strong></td></tr></table><br>
<center><u><strong>Has it made a difference?</strong></u></center>
<strong>Yes and No</strong>.  Scores have not improved, but golf's <em>popularity</em> has!
With the introduction of cavity-backed irons, metal woods, graphite shafts, and oversized clubs, one would imagine that the overall performance of the average golfer, and the professional would each be substantially improved.<br>
However, according to the PGA, the average professional golfer has shaved exactly one stroke off his/her round in the last 25 years.  Similarly, the U.S. Golf Association, after compiling statistics on 1.6 million of its members over the last 13 years, concluded that the average handicaps for male golfers (16) and female golfers (31) have not changed even one stroke during the period of their study.  While the technology has helped the average golfer make more solid contact, it has not allowed the player to alter the physics of the struck ball.<br>
However, the technological improvements made in golf equipment have increased the number of golfers.  The average golfer now feels better about his game as he makes more solid contact with the ball.  While solid contact may leave them in precarious positions off the fairway, the reality of the greater distance and the perception of lower scoring have led to more people playing golf.  Last year almost 25 million people in the U.S. played at least one round of golf, and 5.5 million were avid golfers playing at least 25 rounds per year.<br>
Falcon is uniquely positioned to offer the next technological breakthrough to the golfing masses.  With a product that has characteristics that could actually <em>improve</em> a golfer's performance, FATBOY can be a factor in the industry.

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2>Publishing beyond the desktop:<BR>
Where the DocuTech concept has become reality</FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=-1><strong><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Without documents to support them, your products or services cannot be delivered.  In high-tech industries, it may be product reference manuals in insurance, benefits books and forms in education, course materials in aerospace and defense, crucial product specifications material.  And so it goes.


<P>No matter what your field, the critical criteria for high-volume document production will sound familiar: high quality, low cost, short turnaround time.  There is always a need to produce large volumes of information more effectively, more cost-efficiently and more quickly than by conventional duplication and offset.



<P>Businesses like yours-which need to produce documents of increasing complexity and quality need a production publishing capability.  Offset printing entails too many critical compromises in terms of control, flexibility and timeliness.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="nbs04.jpg" ALT="Photo of manuals" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=160 BORDER=0></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Simply put, businesses and institutions seek a technological breakthrough way to publish beyond the desktop and to bring in-house the high-quality high-volume publishing capability traditionally associated with offset.


<P>The Xerox DocuTech Publishing Series is that breakthrough, merging the technologies of digital scanning, imaging and storage with laser printing and xerography.


<P>
The DocuTech concept isn't pie in the sky.  It's in the workplace now.  If your business requires large volumes of high-quality published documets, chances are that one of your competitors has already discovered the benefits of Xerox DocuTech.  Now you are about to do the same.</strong></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP width=300><FONT  SIZE=-1><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Xerox DocuTech Model 135 brings together three advanced technologies-digital scanning, laser imaging, and xerography-in one simplified solution that takes publishing beyond desktop constraints.  From hardcopy and electronic input, the DocuTech Model 135 produces professional quality, finished documents with unprecedented speed.<BR>
<STRONG><FONT  COLOR=#FF0000>Concurrent operations for unnmtched turnaround</FONT></STRONG><BR>The DocuTech Model 135 combines scanning, printing, and finishing functions into one seamless operation.  It also lets you scan one job while receiving electronic input over a network and printing another job, for an unparalleled increase in productivity and improved turnaround time.<BR>
Concurrent operations enable the DocuTech Model 135 to maintain throughput of up to 135 pages per minute, no matter how short your jobs are.  And it prints these pages with a remarkable 600 dots-per-inch (dpi) resolution.</TD>

<TD valign=TOP width=300><STRONG> <FONT  SIZE=-1><FONT  COLOR=#FF0000>Cut and paste, DocuTech style</FONT></STRONG>Digital masters put the document at your command.  Where a graphic artist would need scissors and glue, you can electronically cut-and-paste any page at the DocuTech user interface.  Quickly.  Easily.  Exactly.  Right up to deadline.<BR>The DocuTech Model 135 lets you combine text and graphics from different originals on one page, resize and rotate images, add halftone screens to photos, and more.  You can even merge hardcopy input with electronic input at the DocuTech user interface.  The DocuTech Model 135 virtually eliminates manual paste-up and significantly reduces prepress operations</FONT>.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><FONT  SIZE=-1><STRONG><FONT  COLOR=#FF0000>Two-sided 11 x 17 prints-automatically</FONT></STRONG>
Two-sided printing of 11" x 17 " paper is key to producing newsletters, booklets, and brochures.  The DocuTech Model 135 makes it easy.  A patented paper raceway automatically inverts 11" x 17 " sheets for fast, reliable second-side printing before they leave the system.<BR>
<STRONG><FONT  COLOR=#FF0000>One-step signature prints</FONT></STRONG><BR>
From typical input originals, the DocuTech Model 135 calculates the proper placement of pages and resequences the digital masters to print two-sided, two-up signature sheets ready for finishing into booklets.  Sheets as large as 11" x 17 " are suitable for signature printing.</FONT></TD>


<TD><FONT  SIZE=-1><STRONG><FONT  COLOR=#FF0000>Plus image enhancement, Internal finishing</FONT></STRONG><BR>
 
The DocuTech Model 135 includes a unique image quality feature that lets you correct problems with input originals and enhance the quality of output prints.  You can crop an image.  Reduce or enlarge it.  Sharpen it.  Apply a halftone screen, or indicate an existing screened halftone to avoid a moir&eacute; pattern on the output.  All to create an optimized digital master ready for volume production.<BR>
And when you're ready for volume production, the DocuTech Model 135 finishes your printed documents in minutes.  Choose single or dual stitching at adjustable locations, thermal-adhesive tape binding in five colors, or slip sheeting.</FONT></TD></FONT>

<center><font size=+2><b>GLOSSARY</b></font></center>
<hr width=60%>
<strong>ACCOMMODATION OR COMPENSATION--</strong> Involuntary activities of the body allowing us to more easily tolerate painful conditions.  For instance, you may have learned to twist you hip slightly to accommodated a sprained ankle.  A holding pattern is a compensation that has become permanent.  The original compensation may have been for physical or psychological trauma.<br><br>
<strong>FASCIA--</strong> Connective tissue abundant in protein and capable of great binding strength.  It covers all muscle cells, all  muscles, many muscle groups, viscera, and the entire body just under the skin.  Fascia has a rich nerve and blood supply and is well adapted to healing.  When injured, it often heals indiscriminately, binding together tissues that should not be bound.  Abdominal adhesions are a well known example.<br><br>
<strong>HOLDING PATTERN--</strong> see "Accommodation."<br><br>
<strong>ISCHEMIA--</strong> The flow of blood is intricately controlled, allowing the nervous system to limit or stop blood flow to small portions or our muscles.  When long term, this causes ischemia, a lack of oxygen and nutrition.  Myofascial trigger points are aggravated (or caused) by ischemia.<br><br>
<strong>PHYSIOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION--</strong> An adverse alteration of function.  Can result from disease and infection, but also from musculoskeletal problems.  Only by correction the real cause can the problem be corrected.  No amount of medicine will permanently cure the headache caused by recurring trigger points.<br><br>
<strong>RELEASE-- </strong> The activity of the body as the nervous system recognizes and normalizes accommodations.<br><br>
<strong>TONUS--</strong>  The activity within every muscle of the body in which some fivers tighten while others relax.  This process is constantly alternated and repeated for all muscles 24 hours a day.<br><br>
<strong>TRIGGER POINT--</strong>  In muscles and other soft tissue, an identifiable location that causes pain or dysfunction somewhere else..  See "Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction" under <a href="clin0660.htm">"TYPES OF DISFUNCTIONS."</a>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Mallstreet: Magnetic Therapy Additional Information</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR=#ffffff>
<FONT SIZE=+3>Magnetic Therapy Additional Information</FONT>
<P>
M+ MAGNETIC PADS and MAGNETIC SUPORT PRODUCTS
<P>
We do not believe that Magnetic fields heal by themselves, and we will not make that
claim.  The manufacturer of these products does believe, however, that they 
can aid your bodies' natural healing powers.
<P>
M+ works to concentrate healing on any body part.  The static magnetic field
penetrates deeply.  The waves produce heat in your body, which allows your blood
vessels to expand and increases blood flow.  This enables your circulatory and
lymphatic systems to perform their jobs more effectively.  Thus your body's natural
healing process works to its fullest capacity.  The scientific principal - the Hall Effect is
further accentuated by acupuncture principles.  M+ is designed to  place the magnets
over your acupuncture meridians to speed the effects.
<P>
<B>Bum Phillips Gives his recommendation:</B>
<PRE>
Dear M+:

Debbie and I first heard about your flexible magnetic products from 
our good friends Bonnie and Andy Everest
of San Antonio.  Bonnie had trouble with her hands swelling from
arthritis to the point of being unable to wear her wedding ring
or hold a glass.  When she showed us that after wearing the
magnets for just a few days she could wear her rings and pick
things up that she couldn t before, we just had to try them
ourselves.  I have arthritis in my right hand and severe swelling
along with nerve damage in my carpal tunnel.  The paid was so
intense that I had to stop playing golf.  It was hard to do
anything with my hands because of the pain involved to do even
simple motions.  My wife, Debbie, has chronic back pain and
suffers with back spasms.  After using the magnetic back support,
she was very surprised with the relief she received in such a
short period of time.  Now that we use our M+ magnets on a
regular basis, we rarely have to take any muscle relaxers or
anti-inflammatory medication.  I am enjoying playing golf again
and can now swing my golf clubs with confidence.  We both have
had such relief from our every-day pains and our most severe pain
problems, that we recommend them to everyone.

Thanks M+! - <I>Bum Phillips</I>
</PRE>
<I>(Former head coach, Houston Oilers and New Orleans Saints,
Houston, Texas)</I>
<P>
DURATION
<P>
No side effects or other negative effects have been attributed
to permanent DC magnetic fields.  Since the effects of static
magnetic fields will vary from person to person and from
application to application, an exact duration of exposure is
difficult to prescribe.
<P>
Caution: DO NOT USE:<BR>
- On open wounds or infected areas<BR>
- When pregnant<BR>
- Close to the heart, if wearing a pacemaker or other cardiac simulator<BR>
- If skin irritation occurs<BR>
- In case of hematoma, wait 24 hours before applying<BR>
<P>
IMPORTANT<BR>
We recommend that you consult a physician on all medical matters.  Pain 
is a body signal.
<P>
With M+ you get the penetrating benefit of the magnetic field,
heat retention and support for the joint from the neoprene.

<LI>Caulk seals the panel joints
<LI>Pressure-preservative-treated wood floor completes the all-wood system. Or, a 4-inch concrete slab floor can be poured over the vapor barrier and gravel layer. (the wood floor system is recommended for maximum homeowner comfort.)
<LI>Gravel layer beneath foundation provides an efficient, unobstructed drainage system. Water flows down through the gravel and away from the house to a daylight drain or into a sump. This drainage system prevents build-up of pressure against the foundation and prevents leaks.
<LI>Pressure-preservative-treated wood-frame foundation walls are engineered to absorb and distribute soil loads.

<TR><TD valign=top width=290><FONT  SIZE=-1><FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>ay the word basement and what comes to mind?  A place that is cold, damp and musty: a place that is only is marginally useful and certainly not a real living space.  But basements need not be dungeons of discomfort and little used space.  With a Permanent Wood Foundation you can see an entirely different picture.  Every year more and more new homes are being built with wood foundations and wood basement floor systems because they take the mustiness, clamminess and humidity out of the basement and create wonderful warm and comfortable lower level spaces that add a special new dimension of livability to the home or building.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Permanent Wood Foundation is an engineered building system that is extremely strong and very durable.  It was developed in a cooperative effort between government and industry.  The system has been proven by years of successful use in over 350,000 homes and structures throughout the United States and Canada.  Wood foundations are accepted by major model building codes, by federal agencies, and by lending, home warranty and fire insurance institutions.<BR>
<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2>P</FONT>ermanent Wood Foundation walls are constructed much like the wood-frame walls in the rest of the house except that much of the lumber and plywood materials are pressure treated with preservatives that become chemically fixed in the wood.  This treatment protects the foundation from fungi, termites and other causes of decay.  Permanently.  The foundation wall are engineered to support the structure and to withstand the forces of earth surrounding the foundation.  Unlike conventional foundations, Permanent Wood Foundations do not crack and do not wick moisture from the ground.  In fact, the system employs a highly effective drainage system that controls moisture and diverts it away from the walls.  The result is a warm, dry, livable basement area.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2>D</FONT>urability of the system has been demonstrated in long term tests conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service Division.  Pressure-preservative-treated wood like that used in the Permanent Wood Foundation has withstood continuous testing in extreme decay and termite conditions with no failures reported after 50 years.  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, "From these continuing long term tests we can predict service life well beyond 100 years".  <BR></FONT></TD><HR WIDTH=1 SIZE=700 NOSHADE><TD width=20></TD><TD valign=TOP width=290>


<FONT  SIZE=-1>

<FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>ince the preservative must become permanently fixed in the cell of the wood to be effective, they do not leach out.  Wood foundation materials are environmentally safe and give off no odor or fumes.  In fact, after several years of testing and review,in 1984 the EPA concluded that wood foundations are safe for use in buildings with human occupancy without restriction.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>n addition to the advantages that have already been mentioned, wood foundations have many additional benefits.  Firstly, the wood frame walls make it easy to install thick, economical batt type insulation.  This means much less heat loss and long term energy savings.  Since nailable studs are already in place finishing is greatly simplified, can be done at reduced cost and in less time.  Electrical wiring and plumbing can be done in the conventional manner and concealed within the walls.  When you compare the wood foundation to a conventional basement of the same exterior dimensions the wood system will yield a sizable amount of additional interior floor space.<BR>


<FONT SIZE=+2>P</FONT>ermanent Wood Foundations are easy to remodel and modify: and most changes can be made at minimal expense.  Its is not a complicated matter to add a window or door, and shelves, pictures and other items can be hung on the wall without special tools or fasteners.  The system simplifies room additions and can be used to economically replace aging conventional foundations.  And finally, wood foundations allow enormous design flexibility.  They can be used with any style of home whether it site built or manufactured; full basement, walkout, split level, crawl space or on grade.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Permanent Wood Foundation is an innovative and highly sensible alternative to conventional concrete masonry basement.  It can provide the combination of total livability, dryness, warmth, energy savings and constructions flexibility that other foundation system cannot match.  When properly design, supplied and installed by qualified people its performance will be outstanding.

<BLOCKQUOTE>"We have panelized and erected a good deal of Permanent Wood Foundations in New England.  The system is dry, clean, and leak proof.  We've found it can save as much as 50 percent in foundation costs.  We are convinced by our rapid growth in orders that the system is the foundation of the future."<BR>
Jim Hebert, President Wood Foundations of
New England, Inc.<BR>
Jamestown, Rhode Island</BLOCKQUOTE>


<BLOCKQUOTE>"We've been involved with the Permanent Wood Foundation for a number of years, and people are starting to request it.  It takes less time than masonry foundations, and can be installed in almost any weather.  We've set up wood foundations at 20 degrees below zero, something impossible to do with concrete.  I feel the
Permanent Wood Foundation is the superior system, and prefer it over concrete without a doubt."<BR>
Mark P. Dillman, President Natural Concepts, Inc.<BR>
Wausau, Wisconsin</BLOCKQUOTE>


<BLOCKQUOTE>"I have now built three Permanent Wood Foundation homes and even though we have a high water table in this area, none has ever experienced any leakage.  The owners report that they are delighted with the dryness of their basements.  I also found the PWF in these homes cost about 15 percent less than masonry foundations."<BR>
Dick Bolam, President
R.A. Bolam Construction
Company<BR>
Pekin, Illinois</BLOCKQUOTE>



<BLOCKQUOTE>"I used the Permanent Wood Foundation for a 1,000 square foot addition project because it's forgiving.  If you make a mistake, it's easy to correct.  I had a zillion items to accommodate from the old structure.  The wood foundation is easy to cut and fit around such problems in a remodel.  It's also a cinch to attach to the existing structure."<BR>
Gary Fish, Carpenter<BR>
Fresno, California</BLOCKQUOTE>


<FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#008000>What Homeowners
Say About
Permanent Wood
Foundations:</FONT>


<BLOCKQUOTE>"If I ever have another home built, the foundation will be like this one.  The remodeling is easier, there's no moisture, it's cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  It cannot in any way compare with a block or solid concrete basement."<BR>
Jim Turck<BR>
Spirit Lake, Iowa</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I initially had no heat in my Permanent Wood Foundation basement.  Yet I've never had exposed pipes freeze, even when we had 24 days in a row with below freezing temperatures.  There's a definite feeling of warmth when I'm down there working.  Of course, it doesn't leak.  I don't know how it could."<BR>
W. L. Griebler<BR>
Port Townsend, Washington</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"After working with the
Permanent Wood Foundation on the job, I knew I had to have one.  My PWF basement is totally equivalent to my home's aboveground space in every way.  My basement is dug five feet into the ground.  I've not experienced any of the typical humidity problems of rust and mildew in summer nor leaks of any kind in winter."<BR>
Howard Nickerson, Architect<BR>
Richmond, Virginia</BLOCKQUOTE>


<BLOCKQUOTE>"I have a Permanent Wood Foundation home.  The foundation has no cracks, is drier, and was less expensive to wire and finish.  There is no way that I would ever, voluntarily, put in a concrete foundation again.  The PWF is to foundations what gypsumboard is to plaster."<BR>
Ed Starostovic,
Professional Engineer<BR>
Madison, Wisconsin</BLOCKQUOTE>


<FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#008000>What Mortgage Lenders Say About
Permanent Wood
Foundations:</FONT>


<BLOCKQUOTE>". . . American Savings Bank endorses construction techniques utilizing the Permanent Wood Foundation when installed using treated plywood and following the procedures as recommended by the American Plywood Association ... (and) ... we feel confident in granting 30-year loans for the construction or purchase of homes utilizing these techniques.  American Savings Bank encourages energy efficiency in housing and is a leader in granting special consideration for loans to purchasers of energy-efficient homes.  As such, we support utilization of the Permanent Wood Foundation and encourage its use."<BR>
Larry D. Johnson<BR>
Vice President, Loan Division
American Savings Bank<BR>
Tacoma, Washington</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"It has indeed been a pleasure to become involved in the initial stages of the Permanent Wood Foundation technique in
California.  Sunrise Bank's
mortgage division will give equal consideration to standard fixed rate loans, whether the foundation is constructed of the traditional concrete slab or the more innovative Permanent Wood Foundation.  The energy conserving values of these techniques should become extremely attractive to the consumer."<BR>

<TR><TD width=300 valign=TOP><FONT  SIZE=+3 COLOR=#0063A4>1. Comfort</FONT><BR>
<FONT  SIZE=-1>Permanent Wood
Foundation basements have all the livability of an above-ground <IMG SRC="pwfo02.jpg" width=150 height=150 align=right>room.  Real wood construction lends a feeling of warmth - not the musty, clammy feeling usually associated with basements.  And because it's more livable, your wood basement will be an integral part of your home.  You'll take advantage of every square foot of living space - below ground and above.</FONT></TD>

<TD width=300 valign=TOP><FONT  SIZE=+3 COLOR=#0063A4>2.Energy Savings</FONT><BR>

<FONT  SIZE=-1>The wood framing of the Permanent Wood Foundation makes it easy to install thick,economical batt-type insulation.  That means less heat loss through the walls and greater long-term energy savings.  The cost of installing insulation is less, too, because the wood frame walls are already in place.  Consider this comparison: in a concrete foundation, 3/4-inch or 1-1/2-inch foam sheathing is typically installed for insulation.  This gives an energy rating of R3 to R6.  In the wood foundation, it's easy to fit 3-1/2-inch-thick insulation between the 2x4 studs, producing an R11 energy rating.  If 5-1/2inch insulation is installed between 2x6 studs, the energy rating increases to R19.</FONT>
</TD></TR>


<TR><TD width=300 valign=TOP><FONT  SIZE=+3 COLOR=#0063A4>3.Ease of Finishing</FONT><BR>

<FONT  SIZE=-1>The Permanent Wood Foundation is easier to finish inside than conventional foundations because the nailable studs are already in place.  Plumbing and wiring are simplified and concealed.  And no furring is needed for installing insulation and gypsum board or paneling.  Because it's so easy, many PWF home buyers elect to do the finishing themselves according to their own tastes and imagination ... and at less cost.</FONT></TD>


<TD width=300 valign=TOP><FONT  SIZE=+3 COLOR=#0063A4>4.Added Living Space</FONT></FONT><BR>

<FONT  SIZE=-1>Permanent Wood Foundations provide more actual living space in basements than concrete or masonry houses of the same dimensions.  That's because the wood foundation walls don't need to be as thick as those of concrete or masonry.  Insulation takes less space, too, because it fits into the cavities of the wood frame wall - extra furring strips aren't necessary.  So you get more room for your money.</FONT></TD></TR>



<TR><TD width=300 valign=TOP><FONT  SIZE=+3 COLOR=#0063A4>5.Ease of Remodeling</FONT></FONT><BR>

<FONT  SIZE=-1>Permanent Wood
Foundations are easy to remodel or modify.<IMG SRC="pwfo04.jpg" align=right>You can cut out window or door openings.  Or add a whole room.  Simple finishing touches, such as pictures and shelves, can be hung without special tools or fasteners.  When adding on to your home, you won't have to worry about providing access for a concrete truck.  Permanent Wood
Foundations have even been used to replace old and weakened masonry and concrete foundations ... with considerable savings in time, expense, and inconvenience.
</FONT></TD>

<TD width=300 valign=TOP><FONT  SIZE=+3 COLOR=#0063A4>6.Design Flexibility</FONT></FONT><BR>

<FONT  SIZE=-1>Permanent Wood Foundations can be used in both single and multi-story structures, and for both site-built and manufactured homes.  The system can be adapted to almost any home design and site plan, and is engineered for a variety of soil conditions, even those with high water tables.  And it is as easy to install for crawl space designs as for split-entry and full basement buildings.

<BODY background="background.gif" TEXT="#000000" link="ff0000">
<center><img src="ufo.gif"><hr width=65%><br><font size=+2><b>RATES AND FEES</b></font></center><br><ul><font size=+1>
<li><strong>PRINT FEES:</strong> Models are booked by the hour or by the day.  Minimum bookings is one hour unless otherwise specified by the Agency.  After the first hour, fees are rounded off to the nearest one-quarter hour.  Rates vary depending upon talents experience level.  Any model's current hourly rate is available upon request.
<br><br><li><strong>DAY RATE: </strong>Day rate bookings are eight consecutive hours.  Day rates must be specified at the time of booking and cannot be changed after the model has arrived at the job.  The full day rate must be paid even if the full eight hours are not used.  Daily rates are based on eight hours of work for the price of six hours.

Before 6:00 a.m. and after midnight is time-and-one-half.  Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays are time-and-one-half except the hours between midnight and 6:00 a.m. which are double.

<br><br><li><strong>TRAVEL TIME: </strong>One-half the hourly rate.
<br><br><li><strong>LINGERIE:</strong> Bras, panties, sheer teddies, gridles are billed at double the models rate.  Non-sheer nightgowns, peignoir or lingerie are at time-and-one-half rate.  Nude panty hose are at triple rate.

<br><br><li><strong>PREMIUMS:</strong> Fees and expiration date of photography to be used for billboards, displays, consumer package, national ads, point of purchase, posters are all negotiable and need specific clearance with UFO.
<br><br><li><strong>STILLS AND COMMERCIAL USAGE:</strong> All photo stills and commercial footage should be used only for the purpose for which they were originated.  Use and time period of usage must be specified on the talent voucher in order for the models release to be valid.  Additional usage or exposure must be checked with UFO for negotiation of additional fees.
<br><br><li><strong>BACKGROUND GROUPS: </strong>When a large group of unidentifiable talent is used, special rates may be negotiated.

with almost <A HREF="stuethnic/StuEthnic.html">4,000 students</A> and nearly

a <A HREF="ihmap/planet/planet.html">planetarium</A> covering 106 acres,
Independence does not lend itself easily to generalizations. In addition
to the 878 classes offered between <A HREF="bulletin/schedule.html">6:58

events. Once the dismissal bell rings, activity continues as athletes practice

        Virtual M-55B, Computer Telecom Networking @ Independence

        High School. IHS is located in the heart of Silicon

        Valley, and is the 12th largest school in the nation; IHS

        enrolls over 4000 students. In one room of this

        122 acre campus is M55B, the class where students learn

        about Networking and Computer Telecommunications. The course

        covers Novell Netware and general networking, and if our

        students pass Novell's certification test, they become

        Certified Network Administrators. Aside from the

Without his help and determination, we would not have a {<FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">modern</FONT>} computer lab (currently being set up). Mr. Bonin also lectures with the basic networking concepts, but his students usually prefer to work "hands-on" with the computers and networking devices. </P>

        <P>We usually reside in two different places; M55B, where we learn our networking concepts inside-out, and C-01 where our new computer lab is currently being set up. This lab, so convenient placed for our students, consists of 30-40 new Pentium systems, but are soon to be networked.</P>

<H3>SANTA CLARA COUNTY, OTHER AREAS SEE INCREASE<BR>
STUDY: MORE TEEN-AGERS LIGHTING UP</H3>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
It's tougher than ever for teens to buy cigarettes in San Jose stores, but
the smoking rate among Santa Clara County youths nonetheless has jumped
11.5 percent in recent years, two new studies show.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, more Santa Clara County teens smoke than their peers throughout
California.<BR>
<BR>
''Kids are in trouble today and this is just one manifestation of acting-
out behavior,'' said L.D. Hirschklau, a health educator in the Los Gatos-
Saratoga High School District. ''We're seeing more kids smoking on campus
and younger kids smoking,'' she added, noting that she is getting increasing
requests for programs from middle schools.<BR>
<BR>
A new study released this week by the California Tobacco Control Program,
a state project, shows that while smoking among teens statewide remains
flat, adolescents in certain regions such as Santa Clara County and San
Mateo County are smoking more than ever.<BR>
<BR>
About 9.7 percent of Santa Clara County teens smoked in 1993, the year of
the most recent survey, up from 8.7 percent in 1990. In San Mateo and Solano
counties, 11.8 percent of adolescents smoked in 1993, up from 9.5 percent
in 1990. The state average was 9.3 percent in 1993.<BR>
<BR>
Interestingly, teens in Alameda County cut back on cigarettes. Only 8.1
percent said they smoked in 1993, down from 12 percent in 1990.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>San Jose sting operation</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
At the same time, merchants became much less willing to sell cigarettes
to minors -- at least in San Jose, where youth activists went to stores
in a public health sting initiative organized by the group Stop Teenage
Addiction To Tobacco (STAT).<BR>
<BR>
The teens go undercover once a year to see how easy it is to buy cigarettes.
In 1992, they found 70 percent of merchants sold them cigarettes. This past
January, only 20 percent would sell to a minor.<BR>
<BR>
''I think that a determined kid is going to be able to get cigarettes, even
when we are convincing merchants to be more careful about selling to teens,''
said Dr. Roger P. Kennedy, a Santa Clara internist and chairman of the Tobacco
Control Coalition of Santa Clara County.<BR>
<BR>
''Our thrust is not only to make it more difficult for them to buy cigarettes,
but also deal with their desire to smoke. We have to counter the very persuasive
advertising that tells youngsters that smoking a cool thing to do.''<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Plans for campaign</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The new figures concern health officials ''because obviously we think teens
are the cornerstone in the campaign against smoking, because the average
age when people start smoking is between 12 and 13 years old,'' said Jeannette
Carmody, a coalition spokeswoman.<BR>
<BR>
Kennedy said the coalition plans to step up its campaign against advertising
that targets young people with promotional jackets and caps and images of
rugged cowboys, slim swimsuit models and cool Joe Camel. They also plan
to reach children before they light up -- as young as third grade -- by
using surveys that reveal which kids think smoking is appealing.<BR>
<BR>
Adolescents smoke for many reasons, said Hirschklau, who conducts focus
group with teens. Teen-age girls tell her they smoke to stay thin and to
soothe stress. Boys say they smoke to project independence, toughness or
escape family or school problems. But one of the biggest risk factors for
all children is whether their parents smoke: The habit usually starts at
home, Hirschklau said.<BR>
<BR>
'Taking over their life'<BR>
<BR>
STAT members said teen-agers are lured into smoking by advertising imagery
and rock idols who puff freely during MTV interviews.<BR>
<BR>
''When a teen smokes, I guess they feel they're taking control of their
life by doing something their parents told them not to. They feel independent,''
said Nikkema Taylor, a 16-year-old Independence High School student. ''When
in fact, cigarettes are taking over their life.''<BR>
<BR>
But the message has not gotten to five teen-age boys clad in skateboarder
grunge-wear who were finishing a smoke across from Los Gatos High School
as the lunch hour ended Tuesday. They talked of wanting to kick the habit
-- and failing -- just like most longtime adult smokers.<BR>
<BR>
''My smoking's totally stress related,'' said Joe Despres, 17, who attends
a county occupational school and smokes a pack a day. ''I've got stress
with school and my parents. It kind of takes your mind off of it.''<BR>
<BR>
Added Brian Hoffman, 18, a Los Gatos senior: ''I think a lot of kids start,
especially in this town, trying to be cool.'' But it is a lot like his coffee
habit, Hoffman said. ''It's kind of hard to quit. Between classes, I want
one.''<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>To combat the trend, school health educators are trying to give
teens the tools to quit.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Youngsters caught with tobacco chew or cigarettes at Los Gatos-Saratoga
or Campbell Unified school districts are required to attend the daylong
Smokeless Saturday School, said Hirschklau, who directs the project.<BR>
<BR>
Teens are taught to give up habits that are part of smoking, such as drinking
coffee or hanging out with friends who smoke. They carry carrot sticks while
driving, so their hands are too occupied to light up, and learn other ways
of coping with stress, she said.<BR>
<BR>
A countywide program called ''What's in, What's Out'' targets teen-age girls
who are particularly susceptible to smoking. ''They believe that once you
quit smoking, you put on 25 to 30 pounds when the average weight that people
put on is 6 to 10 pounds and some people don't gain weight,'' Hirschklau
said.<BR>

<H3>$1.6 MILLION GRANT BY SANTA CLARA FIRM<BR>
INTERNET ACCESS FOR SCHOOLS IS NEARER</H3>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
In this public school, students are able to browse the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C., chat with students in Kobe, Japan, and take a tour
of the Louvre in Paris -- not by boarding a plane but by cruising the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Sound like a school near you? Probably not.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
But Monday, the vision of public schools electronically connected to the
global village became less pie-in-the-sky and more of a real possibility
in Santa Clara County.<BR>
<BR>
3Com Corp., a Fortune 500 networking company based in Santa Clara, committed
$1.6 million in cash, expertise and equipment to help connect the county's
340 public schools to one another and to the worldwide electronic community.<BR>
<BR>
Together with other aid to schools recently announced by Pacific Bell and
the Santa Clara County Office of Education, the 3Com offer lends critical
momentum to the push to connect Santa Clara County's public schools.<BR>
<BR>
Buoyed by 3Com's pledge, San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer on Monday set a target
date of June 1996 for having all of the city's 200 elementary, middle and
high schools wired for Internet access.<BR>
<BR>
And schools in the rest of Santa Clara County won't be far behind, said
Harry Saal of Smart Valley Inc., the public-private consortium that's coordinating
the countywide effort.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's not a slam dunk yet,&quot; Saal said. &quot;But now we're talking
(several) years, not a decade.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Almost two-thirds of U.S. public schools do not have access to the Internet,
according to a report recently released by the U.S. Department of Education.
Vice President Al Gore is pushing to have the nation's classrooms wired
for the Information Age by the year 2000.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Vast learning resources</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Those working to bring the county's schools on-line said it wasn't the technology
that was important but the chance to hook students and teachers up to the
vast learning resources on the Internet. For instance, students could tap
on-line data bases for research, communicate with professors on the East
Coast or discuss the obstacles to world peace with students in Japan.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The power isn't in the technology itself but in bringing the community
together via an electronic medium,&quot; said David Katz, director of the
San Jose Education Network, which is working to bring San Jose-area schools
on-line.<BR>
<BR>
At Silver Creek High School, for instance, students of the Japanese language
in Rushton Hurley's classroom have been electronically collaborating with
students in Kobe, Japan, on a cultural exchange project.<BR>
<BR>
And at San Jose's Independence High School, students are able to send electronic
messages via the Internet to students all over the city.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I can go right now and find students from Oak Grove High School on-line
and talk to them in a chat room,'' said Lucas Pettinati, an Independence
senior.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Discount and expertise</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Last summer, 3Com announced it would provide $2 million to help connect
the 29 high schools in the San Jose Education Network. Monday's pledge of
$1.6 million extends the same support to other Santa Clara County public
schools.*3Com*will provide routers, hubs, switches and other networking
equipment at a deep discount, as well as expertise in network design and
implementation.<BR>
<BR>
Under the Education First program it kicked off in December, Pacific Bell
is offering to wire two locations at every public school in its service
area for Internet access -- and is throwing in one year of free phone service
for classroom computer hookups. It's also lobbying the state Public Utilities
Commission to create a lower ''education rate'' to cut the expense to schools
for on-line phone time, Katz said. The Santa Clara County Office of Education
is offering to hook schools that are wired internally to the Internet, also
for free.<BR>
<BR>
However, public schools still must come up with money for computers and
software. And schools must find the money to wire every classroom -- rather
than just the two sites per school Pacific Bell is paying for.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>'Expensive proposition'</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a pretty expensive proposition,&quot; said Herb Wadley, superintendent
of San Jose's Berryessa Union Elementary School District. He added, however,
that outside offers of assistance from companies such as 3Com put the goal
within reach.<BR>
<BR>
To put computers in all its classrooms and connect them to the outside world
will cost Berryessa $800,000 over five years -- money not now available.<BR>
<BR>
Most districts in the San Jose area are committed to hooking up at least
one site on campus to the Internet by the end of next year, Katz said.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, schools must train teachers so that computers don't gather
dust in the classrooms of those intimidated or unfamiliar with the technology.
And most importantly, schools need to spend time deciding how to blend what's
available on-line into school curricula.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's frankly harder and will take longer to get done than the actual
wiring,&quot; Saal of Smart Valley said.<BR>
<BR>
The push to bring Santa Clara County's public schools on-line began in 1993
when Mayor Hammer pledged $1 million in city funds to help make that happen
in San Jose. The San Jose Education Network was formed to work toward that
goal by fostering partnerships among the city, its schools and Silicon Valley
businesses.<BR>
<BR>
By June, the Education Network is scheduled to have every classroom in 15
San Jose-area high schools wired for Internet access. Among the high schools:
Del Mar, Gunderson, Leigh, Leland, Lincoln, Lynbrook, Prospect, Overfelt,
Westmont and Willow Glen. The remaining 14 high schools would be wired classroom-by-classroom
by the end of next school year. And the participating elementary and middle
schools would be connected at one site on each campus by then as well.<BR>

<H3>PAINTING THE TOWN BEIGE<BR>
STEALTHY GRAFFITI VIGILANTE STAYS ON TAGGERS' TAIL</H3>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
&quot;Graffiti Buster&quot; jumps out of his battered truck in the pre-dawn
darkness and with a one-second swipe of a high-pressured hose covers the
doodlings of a teen-ager on a bus bench in East San Jose. This is how Richard
Davis has achieved what has stumped an entire city bureaucracy for decades:
in a little over a year, he has rid an eight-square-mile section of Alum
Rock of nettlesome graffiti.<BR>
<BR>
The results are irrefutable. Now the ugly marks and scribbles that used
to cover entire stretches of Alum Rock have vanished. And many graffiti
vandals have given up tagging the neighborhood because they know Graffiti
Buster is on their tracks, city officials say.<BR>
<BR>
He's really a hero to us,'' said Hilda Davila, 65, who was watching Graffiti
Buster at work near Overfelt High School recently. &quot;I love that he
cares enough to keep our neighborhood looking clean. More people should
have the courage to do what he does.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
With rumpled blond hair, a paint-stained brown jacket and a tattered orange
construction worker vest, Davis, 37, is Graffiti Buster. He is not looking
for attention, or for trouble. In fact, he prefers the virtual anonymity
his action hero alter ego bestows. He asked that his real last name not
be used in this story because he does not want gang members to track him
down. He will only tell his story to show others that the war on graffiti
can indeed be won.<BR>
<BR>
His truck, a converted laundry delivery van with large letters spray- painted
on the side, is his only publicity. &quot;Graffiti Buster. $100 Rewards.
926-8125.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Pedestrians gawk at the paint-splattered junker with a missing headlight
and four high-pressure paint hoses coiled on the passenger side.<BR>
<BR>
Little do they know that the driver is a member of the San Jose Real Estate
Board with degrees in business economics and mechanical engineering. But
while most colleagues are just beginning to smell the morning coffee, Davis
is performing his unique brand of community service.<BR>
<BR>
Fed up with seeing graffiti on his way to his East San Jose home, Davis
decided that if he didn't do something about the vandalism, no one would.
So in November 1993, he launched his own private little war against the
spray can outlaws.<BR>
<BR>
Since then, he has been out at 5 a.m. seven days a week -- rain or shine
or flood -- armed with pressurized air tanks, drums of donated recycled
paint and an ample supply of &quot;wet paint&quot; signs.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Others gave up</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
While others have tackled graffiti in Alum Rock, most have quickly given
up. As soon as one tag went down, dozens of others replaced it.<BR>
<BR>
Davis, however, thrives on the challenge.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When taggers realize their stuff doesn't stay up longer than a few
hours, they give up,&quot; he said. &quot;They go to other neighborhoods
where their tags will stay up for several weeks or more.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Not everyone is a fan of Davis' crusade.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The city occasionally receives complaints from area residents angry that
Davis does not ask their permission to paint on their property. The critics
also say the brown and beige paint he uses leaves behind ugly patches that
are worse eyesores than the graffiti itself.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He just comes over here and does what he wants,&quot; said Rodrigo
Alonso, 36, who lives off Ocala Avenue in a neighborhood where Davis' patches
cover many fences and walls. &quot;I think what he does is good, I just
wish he would involve residents more.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>City officials also acknowledge that Davis' enthusiasm sometimes
goes overboard.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
&quot;One of the problems we've had with him is that he's had trouble following
city procedure and policy,&quot; said Zulma Maciel, coordinator of the city's
anti-graffiti program. But the city &quot;does appreciate his efforts in
the Alum Rock area. He definitely has taken a lead role in removing graffiti
in that area.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Free of red tape</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Davis said he owes part of his success to the fact that he is not hampered
by bureaucrats and city protocol.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It wouldn't work if I had to wake people up at five o'clock in the
morning to get their permission to paint,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
But he is trying to be more cautious. On a recent trip, he bypassed the
Taqueria El Grullense on King Road without covering the graffiti on the
aqua green walls.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't want the owner to get upset at me because there's a patch
of beige on the side,&quot; he said. &quot;If people tell me not to paint,
I don't do it anymore.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But he is quick to point out that &quot;for every one person that hates
what I'm doing, there's a hundred more that appreciate it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
When Davis painted over the graffiti on Ignacio Baron's fence in December,
the Mexican immigrant handed him three crumpled dollar bills.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A lot of us out here are afraid of these punks who put up graffiti,&quot;
Baron said. &quot;But he doesn't let that stop him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Up the street from Baron's home, two youths walking to Mayfair Junior High
School pointed and laughed when they saw Graffiti Buster's truck.<BR>
<BR>
One of them, Eric Reina, carried a backpack covered with graffiti scribbled
by friends.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I know some taggers who don't like this guy at all,&quot; said Reina,
18, a junior at Independence High School who was walking his younger brother
to school.<BR>
<BR>
While Reina spoke, Davis covered a mark on a fence using a 40-pound tank
he lugged on his back.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Paint and air</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The tank, designed by Davis, resembles those used by deep sea divers. It
carries paint and compressed air.<BR>

<H3>Milpitas, San Jose men are Presidential Scholars</H3>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
Ralph Wong of Milpitas, a student at Bellarmine College Preparatory, and
Duc Luu of San Jose, a student at Independence High School, are among 88
freshman applicants to Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles to be
named Presidential Scholars. The students were selected from 4,000 freshman
applicants for the 1995-'96 academic year.<BR>
<BR>
Wong plans to major in communications and Luu plans to study theater arts.
Presidential Scholars are competing for Trustee Scholarships worth $30,000:
The scholarships are valued at $7,000 the first year and are renewable for
four years with adjustments for inflation. Ten of the 88 students will receive
Trustee Scholarships.<BR>
<BR>
Presidential Scholars are high school seniors with a minimum 3.6 grade point
average who have scored at least 1200 on the Scholastic Assessment Test
(SAT). This year's winners have an average 3.86 grade point average and
scored, on average, more than 1300 on the SAT, a spokesman said.<BR>
<BR>
This year's Presidential Scholars come from 13 states and Canada, 63 of
them from California. Trustee Scholarship winners will be announced in the
spring, the spokesman said.<BR>

<H3>BALLET DANCER GETS SCHOLARSHIPS</H3>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
Maria Ewing of San Jose is a young dancer who's had to make some big decisions
lately.<BR>
<BR>
Maria, a senior at Independence High School, is one of 18 ballet dancers
nationwide to be offered a scholarship to the Joffrey 1995 Summer Program
at the Joffrey Ballet School, American Ballet Center in New York City.<BR>
<BR>
Maria also won a scholarship to the Alvin Ailey Summer Intensive program
and received an invitation for a two-year internship at the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Center in New York City, based on auditions held in February.<BR>
<BR>
Maria, 17, opted to attend the Alvin Ailey summer program and continue with
the internship over the following two years, in part because she will have
opportunities to audition for the company during her internship, a spokeswoman
said.<BR>
<BR>
Yoko Young of Fremont has taught and mentored Maria for three years. Within
that period Maria became Miss Dance of California 1994; was a Top Ten Finalist
at the Miss Dance of America Pageant 1994; and toured Japan with Young,
the 18-member I Love Dance Sweetheart International Touring Company and
company director Kim McKimmie. Maria leaves for New York on June 18.<BR>

<H3>2 TET EVENTS TO OFFER CELEBRATORS A CHOICE</H3>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
One Tet festival will feature a traditional Vietnamese wedding parade, and
the other will have the Super Bowl on big-screen TV with Vietnamese play-by-
play commentators.<BR>
<BR>
For the first time in Santa Clara County, Vietnamese New Year's revelers
have a choice this year as to how they want to celebrate Tet.<BR>
<BR>
With the holiday a little more than a week away, the first of the two fairs
will kick off Saturday at Mission College with firecrackers, dragon dances
and other festivities. The second festival, now in its 13th year, will open
Jan. 27 for three days at the county fairgrounds.<BR>
<BR>
Organizers of the Mission College event say they want to make it a more
traditional alternative to the much larger, more-established festival. Critics
said the fairgrounds event has grown too commercialized over the years,
a charge that its organizers dismiss.<BR>
<BR>
Dozens of volunteers have been working to put together this weekend's festival
at the Santa Clara school. Students from eight Bay Area colleges and San
Jose's Independence High School are pitching in.<BR>
<BR>
Because the organizer, the Vietnamese-American Community Council of Northern
California, started planning at a late date, a lot of work was crammed into
a short time, said treasurer Loann Nguyen.<BR>
<BR>
The Mission College fair ushers in the Year of the Boar a tad early. Tet,
the lunar new year, won't begin this year until Jan. 31. It's a three-day
celebration that emphasizes peace, family, friends and the remembrance of
ancestors. It's like Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's all rolled into
one.<BR>
<BR>
There are similar events for both fairs. Both have martial art demonstrations
and folk dances. Both feature Vietnamese entertainers.<BR>
<BR>
While next weekend's event will include traditional activities, it will
also try to capitalize on football fanaticism among Vietnamese emigres.
The 49ers' appearance in the Super Bowl will be shown on three giant screens,
but ABC's announcers will be replaced with analysis in Vietnamese by three
commentators at the fairgrounds.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Organizers of both events would like to see more non-Vietnamese
attend the festivals.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Japanese have the cherry blossom festival, the Mexicans have Cinco
de Mayo, the Chinese have the (New Year) parade in San Francisco,&quot;
said Hung Lai, an organizer of the fairgrounds festival. &quot;The Tet festival
is our contribution to the San Jose community.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Organizers of both festivals think Vietnamese-Americans in the Bay Area,
who number about 100,000, can support two festivals. Some community folks
think that competition is good for the fairgoers.<BR>
<BR>
One goal of the Mission College festival organizers is to bring down admission
prices at the fairgrounds event, said Loann.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If they reduce the ticket prices or make it free, we won't organize
another Tet festival.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The fairgrounds event is $5 for adults and $2 for children. It's $2 for
the Mission College events and children are free.<BR>
<BR>
About 10,000 are expected for the Mission College events, and about 50,000
for the fairgrounds.<BR>
<BR>
For the past dozen years, the fairgrounds festival, organized by the Coalition
of Nationalist Vietnamese Organizations of Northern California, has been
one of the community's cultural highlights. But last year, several groups
withdrew from the coalition, charging its leadership of being dictatorial
and too soft on communist Vietnam.<BR>
<BR>
Some who quit are now working on Mission College events, but both sides
say there is no rivalry involved.<BR>

<H3>INDEPENDENCE STUDENT OFF TO D.C. MEETING</H3>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
Jackie Cabullo of San Jose has been selected to attend the National Young
Leaders Conference Tuesday through Jan. 29 in Washington, D.C.<BR>
<BR>
Jackie, a junior at Independence High School, will be among 350 National
Scholars from throughout the United States attending the conference. Jackie
and the other participants were selected based on &quot;demonstrated leadership
potential and scholastic merit,&quot; a spokesman said.<BR>
<BR>
Jackie's school activities include serving as 1994-'95 president of the
Filipino American Student Union and membership in University and College
Opportunity. She is listed in the 1994 edition of Who's Who Among American
High School Students.<BR>
<BR>
In the community, Jackie has volunteered at James Lick High School's Day
Care Center, organized Christmas caroling groups to raise money for needy
families, participated in the Community Foundation of Santa Clara County's
youth grant making initiative committee, founded basic and intermediate
Tagalog classes, and is a peer educator volunteer for Filipinos Against
Smoking and Tobacco. She is also a member of the Filipino Youth Coalition.<BR>
<BR>
The theme of the conference is &quot;The Leaders of Tomorrow Meeting the
Leaders of Today.&quot; Students will hear welcoming remarks in the House
of Representatives, participate in a panel discussion at the National Press
Club, visit foreign embassies and more.<BR>
<BR>
Jackie will also participate in leadership-building activities, including
a role-playing activity called ''If I Were President,'' wherein students
assume the roles of the president, members of the Cabinet and congressional
representatives in order to respond to an international crisis involving
North Korea.<BR>
<BR>
The conference will culminate in a ''mock Congress'' in which students assume
the roles of U.S. representatives to debate, amend and vote on proposed
legislation on crime.<BR>
<BR>
The National Young Leaders Conference is sponsored by the Congressional
Youth Leadership Council, a non-profit, non-partisan educational organization
founded in 1985. Each year, only 7,000 students nationwide may participate
in the 20 sessions of the National Young Leaders Conference.<BR>

<H3>SCHOOL PLANETARIUM GAINS TOP-NOTCH BOARD</H3>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
The Independence High School Planetarium recently picked up several strong
and faithful allies in its battle for survival.<BR>
<BR>
East Side Union High School District has assigned 22 people to a sort of
&quot;Friends of the Planetarium&quot; advisory board. The board's mission
is to keep the stargazing facility open by finding ways to make it more
self- sustaining. Already the board has come up with 11 suggestions.<BR>
<BR>
One suggestion is to name the planetarium for a corporate or private sponsor
who in return agrees to fully fund the operation. For example, Fleischmann
Planetarium in Reno, Nev., is named after Fleischmann Margarine, which fully
underwrites that facility. Other suggestions including raising admissions
fees, applying for grants and establishing an endowment fund.<BR>
<BR>
Among the people on the advisory board are well-known Bay Area astronomers,
seven East Side science teachers, three district principals and employees
from Lockheed. Because of budget cuts, Independence started school last
September with the planetarium closed. The planetarium director, Gail Chaid,
was assigned to teach algebra classes. But after support for the star lab
poured in from all over the world, East Side's board of trustees agreed
in October to fund the operation through the first semester. Funding was
later extended through the end of this school year.<BR>
<BR>
It's too early to say what will happen to the planetarium next year. But
having 22 people fighting to keep it afloat sure improve its chances immeasurably.<BR>
<BR>
The planetarium is the only school planetarium in Santa Clara County, and
only one of nine school planetariums in the state. Students from all over

<H3>Welcome to Independence High School</H3>
Welcome to Independence High School, the 12th largest high school in the
nation. Size can have advantages and disadvantages. One of the disadvantages
is that you may not be aware of all the various programs, academies, committees,
services, and other offerings of a school this size.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the material in the orientation section is taken from the WASC (Western
Accreditation of Schools and Colleges) Report which was completed during
the 1993-94 school year. By the way Independence received a six-year accreditation.<BR>
<BR>
There is a special comment section in the Orientation conference in which
we welcome your comments, observations, or questions. We will do our best
to respond in a timely manner.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>Mission Statement</H3>
The mission of Independence High School is to provide a student&shyp;centered
learning environment with access to all. It is a partnership of students,
parents, staff, and community members where everyone continues to be challenged;
where the lessons of the past and the demands of the present create an atmosphere
of tolerance, acceptance, and change leading to an enriched future for every
individual and the community.<BR>

<H3><A NAME="admin"></A>Administration</H3>
The administrative team includes one Principal, one assistant to the Principal,
two Associate Principals, three Villa Principals, and one Supplementary
Programs Coordinator. The administrative team's function is supervision,
evaluation and improvement of the instructional program. The Special Programs
Coordinator oversees the School Site Council and categorical funding and
helps implement Staff Development. Each <A HREF="../adminorg/AdminOrgCht.html">Associate
Principal has specific duties</A>. The Assistant Principal oversees curriculum
and scheduling. This group meets every Friday.<BR>
<BR>
The entire administrative staff maintains an open door policy to meet with
colleagues and gain helpful information and insights into addressing the
needs of Independence High School. The goals of the administrative staff
are focused on writing skills, improving student attendance, delivery of
instruction, and improving standardized test scores. Analysis of AB65, ITAS,
CLAS, PSAT, PLAN, SAT, and ACT results, grade distributions, and other objective
data related to student learning are periodically distributed and discussed.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#index">Return to Category Index</A> <HR>
<H3><A NAME="attend"></A>Attendance/Dropout Rates</H3>
Independence High School recognizes that school attendance and academic
success of students are closely related. The attendance office and villa
office staffs notify the parents of absent students by phone. Student absences
are also noted for each class on the report cards. Letters are sent home
when students have excessive absences or when phone contacts are unsuccessful.
Home/School Liaison staff make home calls where necessary and assist parents
in working with their students in developing regular attendance habits.
On an average day at Independence High School well over 90% of the students
are in attendance. If you have questions about the attendance of your student,
you may call the attendance office or the villa office for his or her attendance
status.<BR>
<BR>
The number of students in grades 10, 11, and 12 who left Independence without
requesting a transcript during the 91-92 school year was 104 which was a
decrease over the previous year. The school staff continued its efforts
to retain students at Independence High School and have them graduate on
time by including strategies such as special orientation programs, study
skill classes, special counseling and alternate ways of earning credits
for graduation. The district employees personnel to work directly with schools
on ways to encourage students to remain in school, to help students set
goals for high school and post high school education, and assist students
with personal problems which interfered with their success in school.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#index">Return to Category Index</A> <HR>

<H3><A NAME="child"></A>Child Development</H3>
The Child Development Program, funded and administered through the East
Side Union High School District, provides child care services and a child
development program for working parents or high school parents. Children
between the ages of six weeks to three years are eligible for enrollment.
The center is open from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#index">Return to Category Index</A> <HR>
<H3><A NAME="class"></A>Class Size</H3>
Class size in the East Side Union High School District varies by subject
from an average of twenty or less in reading classes, ESL, and 9th grade
Opportunity classes to forty-two or less in physical Education. The specific
class size by subject area is established by contractual agreement between
the East Side Teacher Association and the school district. <BR>
<BR>
It is each school's responsibility to monitor class size at that site and
to maintain class averages at or below the agreed upon numbers. Where class
size exceeds the subject average, a monetary penalty is assessed against
the school district.<BR>
<BR>
The typical teaching load for a full-time teacher is five classes plus a
preparation period, with one to three subject level preparations. Teachers
with less than a full-time contract have a proportionate lower teaching
load.<BR>
<BR>
Instructional Aides are provided though state and federal supplementary
funds to assist in math, sheltered science, sheltered world history, sheltered
safety education, and various ESL courses.<BR>
<BR>
Instructional Aides are provided through Special Education funds for all
Special Education classes.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#index">Return to Category Index</A> <HR>
<H3><A NAME="clinical"></A>Clinical Counseling</H3>
Independence High School Clinical Counseling provides supervised Marriage,
Family and Child Counseling Interns to assist students with issues which
are interfering with school success, personal well&shyp;being or growth.
Individual, family and group counseling are available to help young people
and families explore options in problem situations and define appropriate
courses of action. Using short&shyp;term counseling, Independence High School
Clinical Counseling helps with problems like depression, low self&shyp;esteem,
substance abuse, school failure, the separation or divorce of parents, grief
and loss issues, suicide, child physical abuse and sexual molestation.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#index">Return to Category Index</A> <HR>
<H3><A NAME="cocurricular"></A>Co-curricular Program</H3>
Independence High School has a wide range of clubs, organizations, student
government and athletics that students can become involved in. Students
seem to feel that no matter who you are, you can find an activity to fit
your needs. Approximately 52% of students surveyed indicated an involvement
in clubs, student government and/or athletics.<BR>
<BR>
This section of the report highlights a few of the organizations. The Filipino
Clubs teaches the cultural background, and the life&shyp;styles of its peoples.
The Interact Club supports the community through fund raisers such as &quot;Pennies
for People,&quot; in support of the homeless as well as other community
volunteer activities. Clubs such as the Science Club focus on enriching
activities for interested students as well as community service such as
Blood Drives, while the Chess Club combines fun and skill development with
winning numerous tournaments.<BR>
<BR>
Marching Band and The Winter Guard compete, and have won trophies, in both
state and area competitions. The units also participate in community service
activities.<BR>
<BR>
Student Government is organized by Student Senate and Leadership Class.
The goal is to unite people from all grades as they represent the student
population and are an important part of the activities that are planned
for Independence High School. The Leadership Class is open to any student
who wants to become more involved with the school and is willing to attend
and participate in the daily 7:00 a.m. class. Representatives from each
villa at each class level participate. The class members plan all ASB activities:
fund&shyp;raisers, expenditures, rally and assembly organizing, and special
events.<BR>
<BR>
The Independence High School Student Senate serves as both a liaison between
classes and the Leadership Class and as an important implementation part
of ASB activities, such as the Jack Emery Canned Food Drive. Senators are
elected from second period classes. <BR>
<BR>
While the school newspaper The Liberty no longer exists, leaving a void
in student information, Independence High School does have a journalism
class which publishes student writings in a magazine format.<BR>
<BR>
Independence High School does have an excellent yearbook program. The program
has vast resources including instructors who teach skills in both photo
and graphic design. Computers, cameras and necessary equipment add to the
program. <BR>
<BR>
The Intramural and Boys' and Girls' Interscholastic Athletic Programs at
Independence High School are highly regarded. The facilities are among the
best in the county, and includes an Olympic size swimming pool and diving
tower, a gym which can seat 8,000, a lighted football stadium and all&shyp;weather
track. <BR>
<BR>
The wide range of sports runs the entire school year and provides both a
competitive and learning environment in which both the casual athlete and
the student&shyp;athlete can grow and achieve. Academic eligibility requirements
are enforced every six weeks for the Interscholastic Athlete. Approximately
450 to 500 students participate in the Interscholastic Athletic Program
and have the opportunity to compete in league, section and state competition.
All sports are coached and supervised by fully certified and credentialed
personnel. Nearly 1,000 students participate in the Intramural program.<BR>
<BR>
There is equal opportunity for both men and women to compete and the Independence
High School facilities are shared on an equal basis.<BR>
<BR>
Students may participate in a wide variety of activities including clubs
formed around both ethnic groups and interests, varsity, frosh/soph and
intramural sports, and a competitive cheerleading squad. They may participate
in performing arts programs including the marching band, IndepenDance, the
orchestra, choir and musical theater. Several dances are held each year
in addition to the Junior Prom and the Senior Ball in the spring. Seven
rallies are held in the main gym each year as part of the school day. Three
sports rallies honor athletes. The John Tuggle Award is given for community
service at the Jack Emery Rally in December. Members of the Independence
High School community celebrate the ethnic diversity of the campus at the
Multicultural Rally and Food Faire in March.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#index">Return to Category Index</A> <HR>
<H3><A NAME="conflict"></A>Conflict Management</H3>
A Conflict Management program is designed to assist students in resolving
their problems with other students, staff members or families in a proactive
and positive way. Students are trained by a full&shyp;time MSW in an extensive
two&shyp;day workshop to become conflict managers in areas such as effective
listening and communication, respect, accepting responsibility, positive
attitude, problem&shyp;solving skills and how to work out issues. These
techniques may be used before a situation occurs or after an event has happened.
Mediation supplements conflict management by providing a process for dealing
with large cultural groups at odds with one another. The process includes
meeting individually with an entire group, assessing the situation, then
meeting the other group(s) involved in the conflict. After one or two meetings,
the groups are brought together to resolve their differences and come to
an agreement or resolution.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#index">Return to Category Index</A> <HR>
<H3><A NAME="council"></A>Councils</H3>
To support each of these areas, five Resource Councils provide coordinated
services and support to programs, staff, students, families, and the community.
Each council addresses a specific set of needs, as delineated in each plan.
The councils are: 
<UL>
  <LI>Academic Support Council focuses areas of concern for student course
placement, and for LEP, Chapter I, GATE, and Special Education academic
needs. 
  <LI>Curriculum & Instruction Council focuses areas of concern for standards
within integrated curriculum, student achievement, and integration between
programs and departments. 
  <LI>School Site Council focuses on supporting, monitoring and evaluating
the school plan, including staff development and communication with staff
and with parents. 
  <LI>Student Services Resource Council provides integrated and coordinated
services to address personal issues and needs, including conflict resolution,
clinical and peer counseling, health clinic services, support counseling,
and tutoring. 
  <LI>Technology Council provides direction and implementation of the Independence
High School Technology Master Plan.

<A HREF="#index">Return to Category Index</A> <HR>
<H3><A NAME="esl"></A>English as a Second Language (ESL)</H3>
<H4>A. On The Recommendations</H4>
<UL><STRONG>1.</STRONG>The school administration investigate class sizes
in ESL to determine if they are above effective limits.<BR>
<BR>
Since the last WASC report allocation for ESL classes has continued to be
a problem. The allocation for ESL 1 has always been an estimate rather than
an exact number of sections, based on predictions as to how many ESL 1 students
will attend school in the fall. Because of this unknown factor, the district
has always chosen to allocate fewer number of sections than needed. The
district will not allocate more sections unless the students are physically
in attendance. This philosophy not only causes overcrowding of classes,
but also a great disruption to students and classes when schedules must
be changed to fill newly created sections.<BR>
<BR>
This year the district's ESL allocation turned out to be sufficient because
of late enrollment and under enrollment. Therefore classes not filled to
capacity were closed. ESL sections were closed so other ESL 1 sections could
be opened. This again caused overcrowding and major disruptions in the classrooms
as students' schedules needed to be changed (in some cases more than once).
In the meantime, ESL students continued to arrive daily and were placed
in the already overcrowded classes, putting more strain on both the students
and staff. With this in mind, the administration and the ITL for ESL continue
to work cooperatively with one another together with the other ITL's to
try to eliminate overcrowding in the ESL/Sheltered classes. 
</UL>
<H4>B. Student Outcomes</H4>
<UL>The department reports less than 10% failures in ESL and Sheltered classes.
Teachers and students have been working hard to achieve this success. Teachers
are trained in second language acquisition, teaching strategies, and techniques.
All ESL teachers are certified with Language Development Specialist Certificates
by the State of California and/or ESL certified by the Universities. Student
attendance, homework completion, and learning readiness is very good. They
come prepared to learn. When a student is absent or tardy, a parent contact
is made immediately. Tutoring in the primary language is provided daily
before and after school.<BR>
<BR>
80% of ESL 3 students earned grades of &quot;C&quot; or better in their
ESL classes; whereas only 58% of the LA 3 mainstreamed students earned &quot;C&quot;
or better. ESL 3 and mainstreamed Reading Improvement students received
72% and 73% respectively in their classes.<BR>
<BR>
3% of ESL 2 students and 4.3 % of ESL 3 students passed the ITAS AB65 proficiency
tests required for graduation.<BR>
<BR>
A large percentage of students enrolled in sheltered classes earned a &quot;C&quot;
or better as compared with non&shyp;sheltered students in the content area.
The numbers below represent totals for all sheltered classes and a representative
look at mainstreamed classes.<BR>
<BR>
(The above percentages were calculated with grades from the fifth grading
period in April 1993.)<BR>
<BR>
Request that the district provide other alternatives besides ITAS for meeting
graduation requirements.<BR>
<BR>
Student success is also tied to social mixing among immigrant students and
their mainstreamed peers. There is a Friendship Club for newcomers to prevent
isolation and encourage cross cultural understanding. As students acquire
some proficiency in English, they join different ethnic clubs on campus
to encourage cultural pride. The department sponsors a yearly student&shyp;parent&shyp;staff
banquet for academic recognition. 
</UL>
<H4>C.WASC Curriculum Plan</H4>
<UL><STRONG>1.</STRONG> Summary<BR>
<BR>
The ESL curriculum follows the district adopted goals and objectives. The
ESL curriculum is in alignment with the district and the California State
Language Arts Framework. ESL teachers use a variety of teaching strategies
and evaluative tools in second language acquisition. <BR>
<BR>
ESL teachers are encouraged to participate in curriculum development, inservices,
and workshops. Opportunities are given through the district to critique,
evaluate, and revise the ESL curriculum. <BR>
<BR>
The ESL program is a part of the English Department. ESL has a full&shyp;time
instructional team leader to assist staff and students. ESL teachers meet
frequently to discuss program concerns.<BR>
<BR>
Categorical funds support all instructional resources for the ESL program.
These include workshops to develop teaching materials, ordering of supplementary
reading materials and textbooks. Bilingual instructional aides translate
materials. The ESL program provides VCR's, video cameras, slide projectors,
overhead projectors, and other classroom supplies necessary for ESL teaching.
<BR>
<BR>
Within the classroom larger size desks with an ample work area are needed
for high school students to feel comfortable. Storage space within the classroom
is limited. Lighting is too dim; heating and air conditioning is capricious.<BR>
<BR>
The ESL curriculum strongly encourages the infusion of career education.
ESL3 students have access to the Central County Occupational Center (CCOC)
for vocational training, work experience, and other career path opportunities
on campus. ESL students participate in our local college visitation days.<BR>
<BR>
These students are also often in need of employment to help their families
establish themselves. East Side Union High School District's Student Program
for Employment of Disadvantaged Youth (SPEDY) program helps them find jobs
during the summer months. The Career Center provides Youth Employment Services
(YES) and job postings for student throughout the year. Santa Clara Community
Job Core provides on the job training. Work Experience Program allows students
to work and attend school. <BR>
<BR>
Every month ESL representatives from our district meet. Individual school
sites are kept informed via the district's ESL coordinator. Articulation
with our feeder schools is done by an administrator rather than by each
site's ESL instructional team leader. Therefore, information about incoming
9th grade students is limited until they arrive at the site.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>2.</STRONG>Major Strengths 
  <UL>
    <LI>The district and Independence administration allow individual teachers,
special programs, and academies great latitude in developing curriculum
and evaluation methods to suit their students' special needs. 
    <LI>ESL teachers are trained and experienced in a variety of teaching
strategies and techniques. 
    <LI>ESL has a full time instructional team leader to assist staff and

  </UL>
<STRONG>3.</STRONG>Areas for Improvement 
  <UL>
    <LI>Create more collaboration time for ESL teachers. 
    <LI>Acquire more support materials to make the ESL program as effective
as possible for all ESL students. 
    <LI>Establish better articulation with middle schools. 
  </UL>
</UL>
</UL>
<H4>D. ESL Instructional Program</H4>
<UL><STRONG>1.</STRONG> Summary<BR>
<BR>
The ESL curriculum is communicative based and appropriate for LEP students.
The program offers students access to the core curriculum in which activities
are varied and integrated. Core novels reflect cultural diversity. Students
learn about living in America, its cultural values, customs, and standards
of ethics. <BR>
<BR>
ESL students have access to the curriculum through sheltered instruction
in the content areas. Teachers use various strategies, provide supplementary
reading, and instructional materials. Field trips are organized to the Academy
of Sciences, The Exploratorium, San Francisco Zoo, and the Monterey Bay
Aquarium to enhance student comprehension and experiences. Bilingual instructional
aides are placed in content areas. Bilingual tutoring is offered before
and after school. Supplementary reading materials and magazines are provided
in social studies and English. ESL teachers take time to integrate skills
and tutor students in other content areas. Instruction is developmental
and includes a variety of communicative, meaning&shyp;based approaches which
incorporate a range of thinking skills. All students receive teacher&shyp;directed
instruction as well student&shyp;centered interactive instruction. Instruction
includes use of students' home languages and cultural experiences, drawing
from a variety of literature and applying it to real life. Teachers use
a variety of second language teaching strategies which includes students
as peer coaches. Students' language proficiencies are nurtured through a
variety of oral and written language activities. Instruction addresses language
needed for survival, for varied social contexts, and for critical thinking.
It also addresses pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar within the context
of meaningful language activities. Oral language development prepares students
for reading and writing activities. ESL lessons make use of students' prior
knowledge and provide opportunities for the integration of oral and written
language skills. With pre&shyp;literate students, teachers use pictures,
real objects, gestures, and audiovisual materials to convey meaning as students
develop essential oral language and literacy skills. Flexible activities
allow literate and pre&shyp;literate students to work together. Teachers
of sheltered students are to be commended for their use of ESL methods and
innovative techniques to encourage speaking and writing.<BR>
<BR>
Independence offers students support in many different ways. Tutoring is
available before and after school in the student's primary language. The
school community supports the development of the student's native language
through the following classes: Spanish for Spanish speakers and Vietnamese
for Vietnamese speakers. Students are encouraged to participate in extra
curricular activities, such as The Friendship Club and Future Business Leaders
of America. Parents are encouraged to join the School Site Council. Multicultural
appreciation is encouraged by way of student presentations from different
ethnic groups. The school community is to be commended for their work with
LEP students and for their encouragement and support of these students.
<BR>
<BR>
Frequent contact is maintained with the home through bilingual mailings,
telephone calls, and monthly School Advisory Committee and Bilingual Advisory
Committee (SAC/BAC) meetings. Parents may also contact staff members through
the assistance of bilingual aides. Bilingual liaisons are available to make
home visits when needed.<BR>
<BR>
Family Wellness meetings and training in communication, parenting, discipline,
and accessing resources encourage family participation in their student's
education. The principal, teachers, and other school personnel are well
informed and support the goals and objectives of the ESL program. Qualified
teaching and support staff are sensitive to and appreciative of ESL students'
potential and strengths. They show interest and offer praise for students'
accomplishments. Projects are being encouraged which promote interaction
between students from mainstreamed classes and ESL students. Peer interaction
with native English speakers is encouraged to promote positive and linguistic
outcomes. <BR>
<BR>
Money comes from both district and categorical funds for materials, supplies,
personnel, and staff training necessary to carry out an effective Program.
The school implements program support through the SAC/BAC program, Parent
Teacher Student Association (PTSA), and various ethnic clubs. Knowledge
and appreciation of ESL programs is growing in school and in the community
at large. <BR>
<BR>
Student evaluation and assessment in the ESL classroom deserves special
consideration. Language acquisition occurs at varying rates and is a developmental
process. Therefore, both subjective and objective evaluation methods must
be implemented. In addition, all areas of language acquisition, reading,
writing, speaking, and listening, must be considered when evaluating student
progress. All ESL teachers have been trained in language acquisition techniques
and effective methods of assessment. Students and parents have the opportunity
to review the data whenever they choose.<BR>
<BR>
A program exists to recruit and train teachers for the LEP classroom. 32
teachers have completed TTOP or MTTI training. 25 teachers have earned LDS
certification. Other teachers, on their own, have received their TESL certificates.
Teachers in our Newcomers School are being trained to meet the special needs
of preliterate students. Recently, one mentor of sheltered instruction offered
workshops for our freshman orientation teachers and teachers district&shyp;wide.<BR>

<UL><STRONG>1.</STRONG> Summary<BR>
<BR>
For ESL/LEP students, five bilingual instructional aides are shared among
35 classes. These aides speak Vietnamese, Lao, Thai, Spanish, and three
dialects of Filipino. Tutoring in the primary language is provided before
and after school. Reference dictionaries are provided in the primary language,
and translation of materials can be made available upon teacher request.
Learning activities in the ESL courses build on and extend the students'
current level of knowledge. Krashen's theory of Comprehension Plus One is
implemented. (Reading materials are one step higher than the students' reading
level.) Assessment of Language Minority Students (any student who speaks
a foreign language) is for incoming students but is also ongoing, year&shyp;round,
and upon teacher request. A writing sample is taken in the student's primary
language. LEP/ESL students are enrolled in blocked courses at levels 1,2,
and 3. Instruction is carefully designed to build on skills in a sequential
fashion, so that LEP/ESL students can move into mainstream classes. More
than 80% of students move out of the ESL program and are mainstreamed into
the regular language arts curriculum. The ESL program has a full&shyp;time
ITL (Instructional Team Leader) who is always available. Pre&shyp;literate
students (students who are not literate in their own languages) are also
given special attention. These students are placed in classes appropriate
for their level. They develop skills in speaking, reading, and writing English.
Bilingual instructional aides are provided in each class to assist both
teacher and students.<BR>
<BR>
LEP/ESL students receive lessons and assignments that challenge them to
exercise creativity and to develop their higher&shyp; level thinking skills.
They are offered opportunities to reason, reflect, use judgment, and solve
problems concerning situations and issues which affect their lives. LEP/ESL
students are actively involved in their own learning as members of cooperative
groups that produce biography projects, class newspapers, illustrated dictionaries,
and group presentations. <BR>

  <UL>
    <LI>Many teachers have received or are currently receiving instruction
in second language acquisition theory and methods, and have worked or are
working on the LDS or other certificated qualifying them to teach ESL students.
Instruction in the primary language is unrealistic with the student population
speaking over 45 languages; therefore, teachers use strategies of comprehensible
input and English only to instruct ESL students. 
    <LI>The ESL staff is to be commended for providing instructional activities
appropriate to the level of the students. 
    <LI>The department is fortunate to have an ESL mentor who has been instrumental
in leading the department in developing materials, lessons, and activities.
An ESL I and II teacher is to be commended for starting a club for newly&shyp;arrived

<H3><A NAME="fresho"></A>Freshman Orientation</H3>
<H4>I. Program Description</H4>
Freshman Orientation is a one&shyp;year course which all freshmen at Independence
High School are required to take. It was designed to develop academic and
interpersonal skills vital to school and workplace success; to provide prevention
education information concerning drugs, alcohol, tobacco use, pregnancy,
STD's, and AIDS; and to provide computer literacy instruction and career
exploration opportunities.<BR>
<BR>
Freshman O began with a pilot program of ten sections in the 1989&shyp;90
school year. Curriculum was developed by a group of faculty members who
were involved in teaching in the pilot program. In February, 1990 the course
was approved by the district Instructional Programs Committee (IPC). Based
on success in the first year, the course was expanded to include the entire
freshman class in 1990&shyp;91. Currently there are 19 regular sections
of Freshman O taught by 10 faculty members (two are reserved for students
in the UCO program; two are reserved for students in the Teaching Academy;
two are reserved for students in the Performing Arts Academy; three are
reserved for students in the Space Science and Technology Magnet); there
are three sheltered sections taught by two faculty members. In addition
there are four sections of STAR, a program which uses the Freshman O curriculum
with identified at&shyp;risk students. Although the class size is set at
30, teachers in the program have agreed to sign waivers and take approximately
five more students per section. This practice enables us to utilize the
full&shyp;time services of a faculty member who serves as our computer literacy
teacher. Students in each section spend approximately six weeks in the computer
lab with a specialist.<BR>
<BR>
The curriculum for the course undergoes continual development. Materials
are developed on&shyp;site and gleaned from training elsewhere. The necessity
for up&shyp;to&shyp;date materials and the diverse nature of the curriculum
precludes the idea of adopting a textbook. There are five units in the Freshman
Orientation curriculum. The amount of time spent on each unit and the goals
and materials that are emphasized in each unit vary from instructor to instructor.
The units of study include: 
<UL>
  <LI>High School Survival Skills: This unit introduces the campus and its
services to the incoming students. It also provides instruction in time
management, study skills, effective listening, goal setting, cooperative
learning techniques, and learning styles. Throughout the year ten CoRT thinking
skills are introduced and practiced. Skills which are introduced in&nbsp;this
first unit of the year are practiced and reinforced in the materials in
other units.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Computer Literacy: Students learn the basics of word processing, data
base, and spread sheet applications in Apple Works on Apple IIe computers.
Emphasis is placed on developing competence in using the computer for school
assignments and homework. Issues related to business uses and ethical considerations
involving computers are also discussed. Successful completion of this unit
and passing the district computer literacy test completes the computer literacy&nbsp;requirement
for high school graduation.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Career Education: Students complete JOB&shyp;O or a similar career
interest survey, choose an occupation to research and describe to their
class. They develop a four&shyp;year plan for their high school career which
relates to their future educational and career goals. They research qualifications
and outlooks for an occupation they're interested in, and they participate
in a mock interview.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Social Issues/ Awareness: Students learn factual information about
substance abuse (alcohol, drugs, and tobacco) as well as the personal and
social implications of such abuse. Other issues explores include poverty,
violence, gangs, and the environment. Each issue is studied as it relates
to the individual as well as to society as a whole. Refusal skills related
to substance use and abuse are practiced. Family Life and Sexuality: Students
look at the purpose of families and how they work, learn techniques to improve
communication within the family and with peers, consider the importance
of friendship and romantic relationships. Students learn the possible physical
and emotional consequences of sexual relationships and are encouraged to
remain abstinent or practice methods that will protect themselves from pregnancy
and STD's. Information and discussions about AIDS fulfill the AB11 requirements.
</UL>
<H4>II. Guidance and Counseling</H4>
Freshmen have been severely impacted by the cutbacks in counseling services
during the 1992&shyp;93 year. Rather than being assigned a particular counselor,
they see whoever is available when they present themselves in a villa office
for counseling services. This limits or eliminates the possibility of developing
an ongoing counseling relationship. In this environment, some of the services
provided by the Freshman Orientation course fill in the void created by
the cutbacks. Our curriculum does address many guidance issues-goal setting,
decision making, problem solving, interpersonal communication, educational
and career planning. In dealing with these issues in the classroom, teachers
often find the distinction between teacher and counselor becoming blurred,
and many of our teachers have served as advocates and conciliators on campus
for our students. <BR>
<BR>
Students develop a four&shyp;year plan for the academic course of study
in Freshman Orientation. This process was previously facilitated by counselors
who visited the individual classrooms. This year those visits did not occur
although the process was completed. Information about graduation requirements
and college entrance requirements is presented to students as part of this
process. Teachers encourage students to pursue the most rigorous courses
of study they can undertake in order to leave as many future educational
options open as possible. Much of our curriculum deals with personal and
social issues affecting adolescents. This provides us with the opportunity
to try to help individual students understand themselves and their behavior
better, to increase feelings of self&shyp;esteem and to combat social alienation.
It also provides us with a forum for identifying campus and community resources
for dealing with problems related to drug and alcohol abuse, suicide, and
pregnancy. 
<H4>III. Student Paths</H4>
All students complete a four&shyp;year academic plan for high school as
part of the course curriculum. This district mandated process informs students
about graduation requirements and college entrance requirements. In designing
these plans, setting short&shyp;term and long&shyp;term goals is practiced.
Exploring possible career interests also precedes the planning process.
Students are encouraged to pursue courses of study which will challenge
them academically and which will prepare them for post&shyp;secondary plans
in which they have indicated interest. In designing these plans, setting
short&shyp;term and long&shyp;term goals is practiced. <BR>
<BR>
In the past this process has been undertaken with the association of the
counseling staff. But the cutbacks this year have rendered the counselors
unable to provide the classroom visitations attendant to completing the
plans. 
<H4>IV. Special Needs</H4>
ESL, mainstreamed Special Education, at&shyp;risk, and GATE students are
all represented within the student population of the Freshman Orientation
course. The special needs of ESL students are met by sheltering them in
three sections where the pace of instruction is suited to their fluency
level and where peer translators assist students in understanding materials
in English. One problem with these sections, however, this year is their
size which averages 31. Special Education students are mainstreamed into
the regular sections; these students are not always identified, and communication
with their resource teacher is often sporadic. The study skills materials
presented in the course would seem to enable their success in other academic
endeavors. Further, the fact that the course is not bound to a textbook,
but constantly using&nbsp;current materials heightens motivation to succeed.
The needs of at&shyp;risk students are met through four special sections
in the STAR program. All of these sections meet during first period, attempting
to get the day off to a positive start. The regular Freshman Orientation
curriculum is modified by the STAR teachers to meet their students' unique
needs. Thus far, we have been fortunate to maintain the class size for these
sections at 20 (with the waiver this means that they average 24). The needs
of GATE students remain the greatest challenge for us to meet. The perception
exists among many GATE students that since the class is &quot;nonacademic&quot;
(not an A to F requirement for UC admission), it is therefore irrelevant
to their education. In addition to these special needs students, the program
also shelters two sections for UCO students and two sections for Teaching
Academy students where the special needs of those programs are more specifically
addressed. Sheltered sections are planned next year for students in the
Performing Arts Academy and in the Space Science Technology Magnet. 
<H4>V. Integrated Skills</H4>
Program staff attempts to incorporate a variety of skills into all units
in the curriculum: 
<UL>
  <LI>Reading includes nonfiction contemporary materials and computer workbooks.
Emphasis is given to locating main idea and drawing appropriate inferences
from materials presented. 
  <LI>Writing occurs in many contexts. Many students regularly keep journals
on topics related to those under discussion in class; this type of writing
encourages fluency. 
  <LI>Writing for different audiences and different purposes is considered.
  <LI>Speaking skills are improved through participation in role playing,
discussion, and oral presentations. 
  <LI>Listening skills are emphasized in the survival skills portion of
the curriculum in order to promote academic success. This topic is also
addressed in the Family Life and Sexuality unit to enhance interpersonal
communication. 
  <LI>Thinking skills are presented using the CoRT materials. Most of our
teachers have been trained in this curriculum. There is an emphasis in several
units on decision making. In most cases, the kinds of decisions called for
are not abstract, but are directly applicable to the students' personal
and academic lives. 
  <LI>Calculating skills are not really stressed, but materials presented
do include graphs, charts, surveys, and polls which students must learn
to interpret. They are also exposed to spread sheet applications on the
computer. 
  <LI>An appreciation of learning is fostered by presentation of the 4MAT
learning styles to help students understand their own learning styles as
well as those of their teachers. Since many of the concepts learned in the
course&nbsp;are directly applicable to the students' lives, it is hope that
they will see a greater value in learning and become eager to continue learning
both in and out of school. 
  <LI>Students in the Teaching Academy have major sections of the Freshman
Orientation curriculum integrated with their English curriculum as the two
teachers involved in the Academy at the ninth&shyp;grade level plan together,
grade students together, and establish equal expectations for students.

<H3><A NAME="special"></A>Special Education</H3>
<H4>Overview</H4>
The Special Education Department serves approximately 275 students per year.
We offer programs for students with learning handicaps and students with
severe delays of language. We have about fifty students in the delay of
language program and the remainder of students in the learning handicapped
program. In special classes over 50% of the day and the remainder of students
are in the Resource Specialist (RSP) Program who are receiving special services
no more than 49% of the day.<BR>
<BR>
We offer a continuum of services ranging from students in special education
for a full day program (most restrictive) to fully mainstreamed students
(least restrictive environment), depending on the individual needs of the
students. Additionally, some students receive only speech or adaptive physical
education services. In the most restrictive setting, the program within
the Special Education Department provides direct and indirect services by
resourcing with mainstream teachers, offering courses designed for special
education students taught by regular educators, and providing information
to staff. The benefits of co&shyp;teaching in the mainstream classes cannot
be overstated. Not only do special education students receive their education
with their peers in the regular class; but other students, who may not have
been identified but who may need special education services, may experience
greater success because of modification/engineering that the resource specialist
offers. Special education students in co&shyp;taught classes experience
a greater degree of success and are in mainstream classes more frequently
because of this.<BR>
<BR>
The philosophy of the program is to maximize the amount of time the student
will spend in the mainstream. To this end, the department prepares students
to succeed in the mainstream as well as supports students in their mainstream
placements. All students are in the mainstream at least one period per day
and RSP students are in the mainstream 3&shyp;6 periods per day. 
<H4>Special Needs</H4>
Currently special education students have access to the core curriculum
and the department is actively working to improve and increase access for
our students. As students are mainstreamed, we see students develop more
positive feelings about themselves and learning and a reluctance to return
to more sheltered classes. Where a student can not be mainstreamed the department
offers classes that are parallel to the mainstream content. The department
worked to prepare them for entrance into core classes as appropriate. Program
development also occurs at the district level in the vocational area to
meet needs in this area. <BR>
<BR>
A case management system is in place to work with regular education teachers
informing them of the needs of the special education students that they
might have in their classes. Case managers have a vital role in developing
programs for individual students. The duties of case managers include: collaboration
with regular classroom teachers, functioning as liaisons between home/school,
planning programs with parents and students, working with school and other
agencies in behalf of the student, coordinating and implementing Individual
Educational Plans (IEP), coordinating services as specified on IEP's. <BR>
<BR>
Cutbacks in counseling have made it difficult to coordinate scheduling services.
When counseling was available full&shyp;time, special education students
have utilized these services. Case managers have taken on some of this role,
but may not feel as comfortable or knowledgeable about pupil services.<BR>
<BR>
There has been an increasing emphasis on collaboration with the magnet programs,
academies and mainstream teachers. Case managers collaborate with mainstream
teachers on a regular basis to support the students who are on their case
loads. While students have access to academies, the success rate is not
as high as we would like to see. 
<H4>Student Paths</H4>
Students in the Special Education Program take a sequence of courses that
follows the requirements for graduation. To the extent possible and upon
determination of the Individual Education Plan (IEP) team, these students
participate in the core curriculum as offered in the regular program. We
also offer core classes to meet the needs of special needs students that
are taught by Special Education professionals. As skills improve, we transition
students into more challenging classes. Since they follow graduation requirements,
the program of Special Education student is as broad based as any other
student as Independence High School. For some students, following graduation
requirements can be constricting since it limits enrollment in vocational
courses.<BR>
<BR>
Currently, students in our program have their vocational needs addressed
yearly at their IEP meetings. At this time parents and students are informed
about vocational options available on and off campus. These include sheltered
work experience, off campus work experience, occupational center enrollment,
career planning course work, Workability and opening cases with the Department
of Vocational Rehabilitation (many of these are services provided by the
district). We continue to work to improve vocational service for students
in our program. Lack of courses that meet their vocational needs and that
will also fill graduation requirements, loss of counseling services, and
fewer elective courses have contributed to the poor preparation of Special
Education students for life after graduation. Finding ways to infuse career
education into special education curriculum is a challenge that is compounded
with our need to teach these students the skills and strategies they need
that will allow them entry into the core curriculum in the regular program.
As a consequence, our students lose opportunities to learn about a wide
range of careers because their difficulties with learning necessitate that
instructional time be spent teaching state specified graduation requirements/basic
skills. We have not found a viable way of addressing the inappropriateness
of a purely academic program for some of our more disabled students.<BR>
<BR>
The Special Education Department at Independence High School focuses on
preparing students to be successful academically, vocationally, and socially.
The program offers basic skills instruction in the department and supports
students in the mainstream as recommended in the IEP. Teachers in the department
often work together to deliver cohesive units of study in various special
education courses. Basic reading, and language arts classes are taught with
literature as a base for generating reading, thinking, writing, listening,
and speaking activities. Thinking skills and decision&shyp;making are infused
into instruction. The Strategies Intervention Model (SIM) and CoRT are examples
of programs that are taught which integrate thinking skills into the curriculum.
The math courses in the program offer several different strands such as
Consumer Math, Applied Math, Basic Math and transitional classes. Students
are taking a variety of classes in the mainstream where they receive support
from a resource specialist. In the transitional classes, students are taught
collaboratively by regular education instructors and resource teachers.
Because of this, more students are able to benefit from instruction in the
mainstream classroom and more students are taking college preparatory classes.
Currently these transition classes are taught in science, language arts,
math, and social studies. The department strives to place students in the
mainstream whenever possible to provide learning experiences with regular
education students. <BR>

<title>The Independence 76th Cavalry Band</title>
</head>
<h1 align=center><FONT SIZE="6">The Independence 76th Cavalry Band</FONT></h1></center>

<p><hr size=5 width="100%"></p>

<p>The Independence High School 76th Cavalry Band and Color Guard is one
of the finest high school bands in the United States.  Since its
inception in 1976, the band has received more than 750 awards such as
Marching Bands of America, Grand National Champion; and Sweepstakes 
Winner in the California State Championship, Music Bowl, Orange Bowl, 
and the Tournament of Roses Parade.  They have participated in numerous
local and national parades including the Veterans' Day Parade, the 
Santa Clara Parade of Champions, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, 
and the Bicentennial Celebration.  The band has entertained thousands 
of people across the United States.

<p>Independence High School, the 12th largest high school in the nation,
has a student population of over 3,900.  In 1995, 80% of seniors at the 
school received their diplomas; 65% of the senior class continued on 
to two- or four-year colleges. The staff puts forth every effort to 
provide each student with the attention they need to succeed in school.  
The various activities sponsored by IHS offer the students the chance 
to meet with others who share a common interest, whether it be foreign 
language, science, drama, or music.

<p>The 76th Cavalry Band and Color Guard is a very visible part of the 
music department at Independence High School in San Jose, California.  
The band performs in competitions, parades, and various civic events 
which helps develop the students' self-esteem and gives them the 
opportunity to grow socially as well as academically.

<p>National statistics indicate that 94% of the students who drop out 
of school are not involved in any type of school activities. Of the 
17 seniors in the 76th Cavalry Band last year, every one graduated, 
and all but one are going on to college.

<p>While the marching band program at Independence High School was not 
specifically developed to reduce the drop-out rate, promote the 
involvement of minority students in school activities, or inspire 
less-than-enthusiastic students to continue their education after 
graduation, it has succeeded in keeping many students interested in 
school, getting students from a wide range of cultural backgrounds 
involved in an activity which helps to build their self-confidence and 
encourages them to explore their career potentials through the college 
system.

<p>Students who participate in the 76th Cavalry Band and Color Guard 
exhibit a great deal of discipline and commitment to an activity which 
takes up much of their time outside of school.  The effort put forth 
by all members of this band is an extraordinary example of the 
dedication and energy of today's youth.

<p>The members of the band learn not only musical technique and marching 
for field competition but they come to realize the importance of 
discipline and teamwork not just in theory but in real-life situations.  
The students return to school two evening a week for music and drill 
rehearsals and all day Saturday for more practice.  In addition to 
field competitions, the band plays at football games, concerts, 
rallies, and many other school functions.

<p>As musicians, they study diligently to learn the music and the drills, 
and put in hours of practice to put together a first-class show.  
Practice and determination are recognized and applauded among the 
students.  Those who are offered a solo performance have to work even 
harder to make sure that every note is pitch-perfect.  A great solo 
is a great reflection on the whole band.

<p>Considering the incredible amount of time and energy the activity 
demands, it is interesting to note that the band and color guard 
members put as much effort into their performances as most adults do 
into their careers.  Many of them have found a feeling of self-worth 
and of belonging that was missing from some other parts of their lives.  
Many of the students come from single-parent homes while others may be 
the only child in an adult household.  Joining the band, they become 
part of a young, active "family" with a very positive image.

<p>The members of the 76th Cavalry Band and Color Guard come from many 
cultural backgrounds,  almost 85% of these students are classified as 
minorities.  The ethnic breakdown is as follows:
<center>
<table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=3>
<tr align=left>
<td>African-American</td> <td>6.4%</td> <td> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Filipino</td> <td>13.5%</td>
</tr><tr align=left>
<td>Asian</td> <td>29.2%</td> <td> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hispanic</td> <td>34.4%</td>
</tr><tr align=left>
<td>Caucasian</td> <td>15.2%</td> <td> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Native American</td> <td>1.1%</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The band is frequently invited to perform in parades and concerts.  
Their reputation as an award winning band in well-known and appreciated 
throughout the community.

<p>The band makes time, during their hectic schedule, to participate in 
the community.  Every Christmas, they participate in the Jack Emery 
Drive, a schoolwide event where students canvas the neighborhoods for 
donations of canned goods, clothing and other usable items for the 
needy.  They also perform at the Special Olympics celebration held 
each year at Agnews Hospital.

<p>The Director of the band is Mike Kambeitz.  The staff consists of a 
drill writer, two marching instructors, two percussion instructors, 
and three color guard instructors.

<p>The Independence 76th Cavalry Band Boosters is a non-profit organization
comprised of family members, friends, and alumni of the band. This valuable
support organization is responsible for distribution and maintenance of
the uniforms and equipment, organizing fundraising events, chaperoning
every event, and anything else that needs to be done. They cheer the band
on from the stands during competitions and run along side them in parades
with water bottles. The Band Boosters are there whenever and wherever the
band needs them. </p>

<BR>
Welcome to our solar system! Take a tour of the planets in our universe
by clicking on the great links to <STRONG>WWW sites </STRONG>and learn some
interesting facts about them! <BR>
</UL>
<HR></H3><IMG SRC="merglobe.gif" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mercury.html">Mercury</A>
<A HREF="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/gplanets/welcome/mercury.htm"><BR>
Another Mercury Site </A><BR>
<BR>
Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. So it's the hottest, right? Wrong!
Mercury has hardly any atmosphere so heat escapes into space.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="venglobe.gif" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nine%20planets/nineplanets/venus.html">
Venus </A><A HREF="http://stardust.jpl.nsas.gov/gplanets/welcome/venus.htm"><BR>
Another Venus Site</A><BR>
<BR>
Venus is so hot that lead, tin and zinc would easily melt. This is because
a greenhouse effect keeps heat from escaping.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="earglobe.gif" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></IMG><A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona%2Cedu/nineplanets/nineplanets/earth.html">Earth</A>
<A HREF="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.%0Agov/gplanets/welcome/earth.htm"><BR>
Another Earth Site</A><BR>
<BR>
Because of it's distance from the Sun, Earth alone has the right temperature
for liquid water - so vital to life.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="marglobe.gif" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html">Mars</A>
<A HREF="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/gplanets/welcome/mars.htm"><BR>
Another Mars Site </A><BR>
<BR>
Mars is the most likely planet to support life after Earth. It can be 70
degrees farenheit during the day, but plunges to -90 degrees farenheit at
night!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="jupglobe.gif" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets%0A%0A/nineplanets/jupiter.html">Jupiter</A>
<A HREF="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/gplanets/welcome/jupiter.htm"><BR>
Another Jupiter Site</A><BR>
<BR>
The colored bands on Jupiter are produced by rapidly spinning gases.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="saturn.gif" WIDTH="78" HEIGHT="100" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets%0A%0A/nineplanets/saturn.html">Saturn</A>
<A HREF="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/gplanets%0A%0A/welcome/saturn.htm"><BR>
Another Saturn Site </A><BR>
<BR>
While other planets have rings, Saturn's are by far the most stunning! The
ring's icy bits are tiny, from the size of your thumb to the size of your
house.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="uraglobe.gif" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/uranus.html">Uranus</A>
<A HREF="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/gplanets/welcome/uranus.htm"><BR>
Another Uranus Site </A><BR>
<BR>
This planet is tilted on it's side so that the poles face the Sun, instead
of the equator.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="nepglobe.gif" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/neptune.html">
Neptune</A> <A HREF="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/gplanets/welcome/neptune.htm"><BR>
Another Neptune Site </A><BR>
<BR>
This planet was discovered by scientists who observed the movements of Jupiter,
Saturn and Uranus. They determined the movements were because of the gravitational
effect of another object. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="plutoch.gif" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="100" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.%0A%0Aedu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html">Pluto</A>
<A HREF="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/gplanets/welcome/pluto.htm"><BR>
Another Pluto Site </A><BR>
<BR>
The orbit of Pluto is inclined relative to the orbit of the other planets.
It is also elliptical so it is sometimes closer to Neptune than the Sun.<BR>

The mission of IHS is to make sure that all students receive a high school
diploma and continue their education after graduation. Wise career preparation
not only depends on success in high school but on making sound plans for
training after high school. Universities, community colleges, and technical
school entrance requirements must be considered when making course selections.
Independence High School offers a wide variety of excellent academic, vocational
and co-curricular programs to meet the diverse needs of the students. IHS
counselors are always available to meet with parents or answer phone requests
for information.<BR>
<BR>
Beginning the week of March 2 the IHS counseling staff will be meeting with
students to talk about selecting courses for the following school year.
Counselors will make two visits to student's English, History, or Freshman
Orientation classes. On the first visit they will present the process and
materials for course selection. They will talk with students about course
options and answer questions. A week later they will return to answer questions
and collect students' course selection forms. We urge families to use the
week to discuss course offerings, programs, and student progress so that
the best educational choices will be made.<BR>
<BR>
Courses selected by students and availability of staff are used in determining
the IHS educational programs for the following year. Only courses which
meet minimum student enrollment limits will be offered. <STRONG>COURSE SELECTIONS
SHOULD BE MADE CAREFULLY! PROGRAM CHANGES MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE AFTER JUNE
1.</STRONG> Specific teachers and periods are not part of this process.
They are determined during the summer as part of the computer scheduling
process.<BR>
<BR>
Students who complete the enrollment process will pick up their class schedule
before first period on the first day of school. <STRONG>THIS CLASS SCHEDULE
WILL ONLY BE GOOD ON THE FIRST DAY OF CLASSES.</STRONG> Any student not
attending all classes on the first day of school will need to re-enroll
upon returning to school.<BR>
<BR>
We wish you well in this all important task of selecting the most appropriate
educational program for the upcoming school year. IHS offers the highest
quality of educational programs and has the finest educational facilities
found in the United States. Families are invited to visit classes and keep
in touch with teachers and counselors throughout the school year.<BR>

<STRONG>July 23, 1995</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Dear fellow book-lovers,<BR>
<BR>
Welcome to the Internet Book Information Center, which maintains the WorldWideWeb
Virtual Library on Literature. (For other subjects in the WWW Virtual Library,
see the <A NAME="61"></A><A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html">Subject
Index </A>at CERN.) Serverspace for this project is provided courtesy of
the good and generous folks at <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/">Sunsite</A>,
a joint project of Sun Microsystems and the University of North Carolina-Chapel
Hill. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Book of the week: </STRONG>JANE'S FIGHTING SHIPS, ed. Capt. Richard
Sharpe, RN (<A HREF="http://www.janes.com/">Jane's</A>). In this week's
Editor's Journal, you can find out why I was the only nine-year-old on the
planet who asked Santa Claus for a copy of Jane's at the height of the Vietnam
War.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Site of the week:</STRONG> the <A HREF="http://www.bdd.com/">Bantam
Doubleday Dell</A> home page, which provides excellent feature-style interviews
with authors of the week such as <A HREF="http://www.bdd.com/athwk/bddathwk.cgi?w=06-19-95&m=bddpreat">John
Grisham</A> and <A HREF="http://www.bdd.com/athwk/bddathwk.cgi">Pat Conroy</A>,
as well as some nice touches, like links to related Internet resources.
<BR>
<BR>
Best regards and wishes,<BR>
<BR>
Frederick Zimmerman, Editor & Publisher<BR>
<BR>
<HR>Below my signature and the <STRONG>sponsorship location</STRONG>, I
will append <STRONG>The IBIC Guide to Book-Related Resources on the Internet.</STRONG>
<H2>The IBIC Guide to Book-Related Resources on the Internet</H2>
<H3>Authors</H3>
The world of books begins with authors. The friendly folks at <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</A>
maintain a comprehensive <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Books/Authors/">laundry
list of authors</A>. I formerly maintained an IBIC list of authors, and
it still lists some sites that are not listed at Yahoo.<BR>
<BR>
N.B., generally: the technology developed by the fine folks at Yahoo is
much better at keeping laundry lists than I am, and if you are an author,
bookseller, or publisher who wants to make sure your site's on the map,
I strongly recommend that you <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/bin/add">register
yourself at Yahoo using their Add form</A>. Please do tell me about your
interesting site so that I can write about it in the &quot;fresh&quot; paragraphs
above, but be aware I'm no longer in the business of maintaining laundry
lists.<BR>
<BR>
If you look at Yahoo for information about a particular author but find
nothing, I suggest that you try a <A HREF="http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos
search</A>. Another worthwhile alternative is to post a query to the Usenet
newsgroup rec.arts.books or the relevant topical newsgroup. You may be pleasantly
surprised at the speed with which your question is answered by the global
consciousness. <BR>
<BR>
Speaking of global consciousness, I want to emphasize that I am well aware
that the Net and the Web are global resources shared by people of all nations.
As maintainer of the WorldWideWeb Virtual Library on Literature I believe
I have a special responsibility to maintain the <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/ibic/IBIC-World-Lit.html">World
Literature</A> list, which provides links to works by authors in many different
languages and cultures. If you maintain an online resource devoted to non-English
literature, please let me know, subject line &quot;add World-Lit.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Aspiring authors may wish to check out the <A HREF="http://www.interlog.com/~ohi/www/writesource.html">WWW-VL
Writer's Resources On The Web</A>; <A HREF="http://bel.avonibp.co.uk/bricolage/resources/bureau/IWRG/index.html">The
Internet Writers Resource Guide</A>; <A HREF="http://bel.avonibp.co.uk/bricolage/welcome.html">bricolage</A>--a
monthly publication which tracks writing-related information and developments
on the Internet; <A HREF="http://www.interlog.com/~ohi/dmo-pages/writers.html">INKSPOT:
Children's Writer's Resource</A>; and <A HREF="http://www.interport.net/~hdu/">Children's
Books and More</A>. The newsgroup misc.writing has a lot of supportive and
informative postings. 
<H3>Publishers</H3>
Publishers bring authors to the world. They also bring a lot of useful information
to the Internet, although, as with everything else on the Web, the quality
and depth vary considerably. I suggest you begin with the <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Business/Corporations/Publishing/">Yahoo
Business:Corporations:Publishing</A> page and with the <A HREF="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/publishers.html">CERN
Virtual Library on Publishers</A> (which also has a self-registering form).
There is a very strong list at <A HREF="http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/law/acqs/pub_alph.html">AcqWeb</A>,
which is tailored for the scholarly and comprehensive interests of acquisitions
librarians. And I formerly maintained a <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/ibic/IBIC-Publishers-Row.html#Directory">list
of miscellaneous IBIC publisher pointers</A>. 
<H3>Booksellers</H3>
Once a book is published, booksellers put it in the public's hands. I must
say that for all that I love the Internet, and for all the time I've spent
developing this resource, I still get a visceral thrill when I walk into
a bookstore that I have never felt on the Internet. There are a lot of people
trying to figure out how to sell books on the Internet; but, frankly, I
don't think anyone has figured out how to match the experience you get when
you browse at a good full-service bookstore. (As an Ann Arbor native, I
have to tip my hat to <A HREF="http://www.borders.com/borders/">Borders
Books & Music</A>.)<BR>
<BR>
I will draw your attention to a few of the most interesting efforts by booksellers.
Here I suggest you begin with the <A HREF="http://www.ambook.org/bookweb/">American
Booksellers Association</A> and <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Business/Corporations/Books/">Yahoo's
list of booksellers</A>. There are also several good sites which sprang
up specifically to experiment with selling books online. Worth checking
out, for example, is <A HREF="http://www.books.com/">Book Stacks Unlimited</A>,
which has been around for a long time (in Net terms, which are like dog
years) and has an online ordering facility with a large catalog, and <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</A>,
which boasts a 1 million book catalog. I also like <A HREF="http://www.bookport.com/">Bookport
</A>and <A HREF="http://www.infi.net/bookpage/">BookPage</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Incidentally, as far as I can tell, Books in Print is <STRONG>NOT</STRONG>
available via the Internet. But your favorite bookseller should be happy
to help you find a title, whether you make contact by phone, by e-mail,
or by good old fashioned shoe leather. 
<H3>Libraries</H3>
As I've frequently explained to my three-year-old daughter, Kelsey, during
our regular weekly visits to the <A HREF="http://www.sils.umich.edu/~rbkemp/AAHomePage.html">Ann
Arbor Public Library</A> to check out Babar and Madeline books, &quot;libraries
are places where people share books.&quot; Libraries have contributed greatly
to my life and prosperity (and I to theirs, especially the library at <A HREF="http://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore
College</A>; I nearly did not graduate with my class because I owed $144
in overdue fines ;-) and I am glad to honor libraries and librarians in
this space. I recommend <A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/homepage/lchp.html">Library
of Congress World Wide Web Home Page</A> and the <A HREF="http://ipl.sils.umich.edu/">Internet
Public Library </A>as starting points. I also suggest you take a look at
the <A HREF="http://www.lib.lsu.edu/hum/lit.html">Literature Webliography</A>,
a well organized guide to scholarly library resources maintained by Stephen
R. Harris at Lousiana State University. There is a page of <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/ibic/IBIC-Libraries.html">miscellaneous
IBIC library pointers</A>, but remember--I'm no librarian! 
<H3>Readers</H3>
It is once readers begin to love a book that it really begins to live. It
is in this grass roots spirit that I applaud Homespun's <A HREF="http://www.best.com/~yylee/homespun/booktop.html">Book
Recommendations of Real People</A>; Tristram Cooke's <A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/iz/Books/Top100/top100.html">Internet
Top 100 SF & Fantasy Books</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.primus.com/staff/paulp/one-book.txt">One
Book List</A> by Paul Phillips. It was also in that spirit that I ran a
feature asking for recommendations for Books for the Twenty-First Century,
but I wasn't really happy with the results, and as a result have stopped
updating it. Any ideas?<BR>
<BR>
Many of us like to know whether a book has received good reviews. I maintain
<A NAME="IVRB"></A>The IBIC Virtual Review of Books, a collection of pointers
to book review resources around the Internet, which includes both general
interest and subject oriented reviews. The IVRB is comprehensive, and there's
nothing else quite like it on the Internet. If you maintain an online book
review that you'd like to have linked in, please let me know, subject line
&quot;add-IVRB&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Some of us put a lot of stock in awards and other meritocratic honors. If
you're short on reading time, awards are certainly an efficient way of eliminating
&quot;false positives&quot;--most books that win awards really are pretty
good. I recommend you begin with Jack Siler's list of <A HREF="http://compstat.wharton.upenn.edu:8001/~siler/litlists.html">Literary
Prizes</A> and <A HREF="http://www.lm.com/~lmann/awards/awardweb.html">Laurie
Mann's AwardWeb</A>. I gave out a couple of awards last year--the 1994 Ibbies
(Internet Book Information Center Awards) and it was fun; I will probably
do it again this year.<BR>
<BR>
Some of us are even crass or unjudgmental enough to think that a book that
sells a lot of copies must have some value in it. Check out the <A HREF="http://www.bookwire.com/PW/bsl/bestseller-index.html">Publishers'
Weekly Best-Seller Lists</A> at <A HREF="http://www.bookwire.com/">Bookwire</A>;
a nifty feature is that many identified books are hotlinked to recent PW
reviews.<BR>
<BR>
Books have an impact on people. [Bonk!] That's the idea behind <STRONG>The
Commonplace Book</STRONG> (n.): an edited collection of striking passages
noted in a single place for future reference. The goal of this experimental
Commonplace Book home page is to test the concept of an Internet Commonplace
Book built by and available to a wide variety of users. I can tell from
my e-mail and my user statistics that people really like The Commonplace
Book, but I haven't been able to keep it up to date very well. So I've begun
to experiment with a new hypermail version. 
<H3>Rare Books</H3>
Some books are so well loved that they live on long after those who first
read them. For those who love rare books, I recommend the <A HREF="http://www.abaa-booknet.com/">Antiquarian
Booksellers of America</A> Web Site and the <A HREF="http://www.smartdocs.com/~bree/">Bibliophile</A>
home page and mailing list. To subscribe to the Bibliophile Mailing List,
send email to <A HREF="mailto:biblio-request@smartdocs.com">biblio-request@smartdocs.com</A>
and put &quot;subscribe&quot; (without the quotes) in the body of your letter.
Rookies may also enjoy the nice <A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~gnwmult/list.html">glossary
of book collecting terms</A> at the Great Northwest Multnomah Bookstore
in my brother Carl's old stomping grounds in Portland, Oregon.<BR>
<BR>
If you are interested in locating a particular rare or used book, I suggest
you trying posting to the newsgroup <A HREF="news:rec.arts.books.marketplace">rec.arts.books.marketplace</A>.
<H3>Online Books and Magazines</H3>
As you might expect, I think online magazines are a promising genre. In
fact, you could easily consider IBIC a magazine, except that at the outset
I consciously decided to call IBIC an &quot;Information Center&quot; rather
than a magazine because the information is updated whenever the inclination
strikes me--as opposed to a regular frequency--but that's really the only
difference. I even offer the opportunity to sponsor this page now, just
like a magazine.<BR>
<BR>
In any event, if you are interested in online magazines, I recommend that
you begin with the <A HREF="http://www.4mesa.com/4mesa/weblist/ejournal.html">WWW
Virtual Library on Electronic Journals</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Now that the Net is here, a lot of people like to read books online. I personally
don't find it enjoyable--I love the tactile experience of a book, and I
don't like peering at the computer screen to read a classic novel--but my
user stats and e-mail show that there are a lot of people who do enjoy it.
So I provide <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/ibic/IBIC-Online.html">an IBIC
list of online Books and Magazines</A>, from which you can navigate to most
of the books that are available online in the public domain. 
<H3>Poetry</H3>
Not all poetry is found in books, and not all books are poetry; but the
love of poetry is closely related to the love of books. I suggest you start
with <A HREF="http://english-server.hss.cmu.edu/Poetry.html">the CMU poetry
archive</A> (alpha by author) and <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/dykki/poetry/home.html">The
Internet Poetry Archive,</A> developed by <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/">Sunsite</A>'s
own Paul Jones. Also worthwhile is <A HREF="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/etext/britpo/britpo.html">the
University of Virginia's British Poetry Archive</A>; and <A HREF="http://www.cfn.cs.dal.ca/~ac628/opoets.html">a
poetry page put together by Ryan Deschamps,</A> including poems by Leonard
Cohen, Thomas Hardy, and Stevie Smith.<BR>
<BR>
It is strange to say that &quot;an interesting computerized poetry system&quot;
exists, but I think many people will enjoy taking a look at Tom O'Donnell's
version of <A HREF="http://www.panix.com/~todonnel/rqueneau.shtml">Raymond
Queneau's CENT MILLE MILLIARDS DE PO&#187;MES</A>. I liked it because it
reminded me of the wonderful French literature teacher I had in high school,
Jacques Karamanoukian, a genuine enthusiast who shared his love for the
majesty of French literature. Discovering that I could read Moliere and
Racine in the original was one of the most exciting and transformative experiences
of my life. But my wife will warn you--don't get me started about <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/electronic-publications/ibic/Commonplace.Book/Wilde_on_Balzac.txt">how
much I like Balzac</A>! 
<H3>The Reference Shelf</H3>
There are a lot of good reference works available online; I compiled an
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/ibic/IBIC-Reference.html">IBIC Reference
Shelf </A>some time ago. A <A HREF="http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos search</A>
is also a good way to sniff around. But IMHO the bottom line is still that
if you need to look something up, in most cases, you're better off going
to the library, consulting the catalog, going to the right area of the stacks,
and leafing through books until you learn something. You might even (heaven
forbid!) ask a reference librarian. (This especially applies to college
students who write to me asking me to jump start their term papers.)<BR>
<BR>
Another good way to find answers to particular questions is to try posting
to a relevant newsgroup such as rec.arts.books. This works best when you
are looking for very specific points of information. 
<H3>Getting on The Internet</H3>
If you want to create an Internet resource for book-lovers, the best place
to start is with your system administrator, if you have one, or a local
<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Business/Corporations/Internet_Access_Providers/">Internet
access provider</A>. Businesses interested in using the Internet to draw
public attention to their activities may wish to consult the IBIC list of
book-related Internet service providers. 
<H3>The Format of this Page</H3>
Ordinarily, the first paragraph or two of this page will draw your attention
to especially noteworthy new books and new Internet sites. Typically I'll
describe a book and its publisher in a snappy sentence or two, then link
to a longer description in the Editor's Journal, which is a more comprehensive
accounting of what I've been reading recently. Authors and publishers are
welcome to send me review copies. <BR>
<BR>
I also highlight the best current magazines in the <STRONG>Media Junkie</STRONG>
page (under construction), and will occasionally review movies and television
programs that are based on books. (I would do a feature on &quot;books of
the Academy Awards&quot; next year, except that when the nominations come
out, I'll probably be studying for the #$%^&amp;* Michigan bar).<BR>
<BR>
I'll also spotlight especially interesting new Internet resources related
to books. You may find a more comprehensive accounting of new sites in the
What's New page (although recently I have been too busy to keep it up to
date). Submissions are welcome, subject line &quot;What's New&quot;. (Caveat
#1 re What's New: I can't guarantee that I'll post everything I receive--I
do this as a hobby. Caveat #2 re What's New: if you want your site listed,
please, please send the information with links and hypefree descriptions
marked up in HTML.) 
<H3>At the End of the Food Chain?</H3>
Last but, I trust, not least in the food chain that brings books together
with those who love them [an edifying metaphor, eh? chomp, chomp] are those
organizations that, like this Internet Book Information Center, focus on
using the Internet to bring readers information about books. For example,
there's <A HREF="http://www.bookwire.com/">Bookwire</A>, which has an excellent
suite of comprehensive online resource directories as well as an important
alliance with Publishers' Weekly; GNN's <A HREF="http://gnn.com/gnn/meta/book/index.html">BookStory</A>,
which provides interesting focus pieces on a few authors; and <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</A>,
which offers a clever service called Eyes & Editors to notify you by e-mail
when books are released that match your interests. I hear rumors about well-funded
startups like Content.com, and I have no doubt that several of the major
publishing companies are also trying to figure out how to occupy this niche
in a profitable way. <BR>
<BR>
What makes IBIC different? 
<OL>
  <LI>Well, for starters, I was here first;-). IBIC has been operational
since March 30, 1994, which makes it positively geriatric in the world of
Internet resource discovery. That's why Publishers' Weekly called IBIC <STRONG>&quot;the
granddaddy of book-related resources on the Internet&quot;</STRONG> (June
1995). 
  <LI>You'll find if you follow the links into /ibic-space that there's
a lot of accumulated depth here that rewards browsing (as book-lovers should
expect!). As of June 1995, there were almost 200 html files comprising more
than 1.1 MB of text + html--the equivalent of a good-sized book. 
  <LI>I don't have a major business axe to grind. I'm not trying to sell
books or corner the market on Internet web services for publishers. I do
want to maintain and grow an audience in such a way that this is a self-sustaining
investment of my time; and if you are an online publisher who'd like to
hire me to do just that, please call! But my primary mission is to pay back
the world of books--which has given me so much--by using the Internet to
serve book-lovers. 
  <LI>I try to provide you with a <STRONG>meta</STRONG>resource or switchboard
that points you to the most useful and interesting book-related resources
on the Internet. In keeping with the distributed spirit of the Internet,
I point to the best resources, wherever they are located, without fear or
favor. My goal is to provide maximum value to you, the book-lover. 
  <LI>I try to be both selective and comprehensive. It's not an easy balance
to strike, but in my judgment that's what's necessary to make a really useful
reference tool. 
  <LI>Most importantly, perhaps, <STRONG>this is a personal effort</STRONG>.
For better or for worse, you get <EM>my</EM> take on books and book-related
Internet resources. My experience as a lifelong media junkie, and several
years working for national special interest magazines with colorful editors,
plus my e-mail and my user statistics (<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/lunarbin/sss.cgi">search
on &quot;ibic&quot;</A>), tells me that <STRONG>people like point of view</STRONG>.
</OL>
You are warmly encouraged to send mail to ibic@sunsite.unc.edu to recommend
additional resources for these pages, to draw my attention to links that
do not appear to be working properly, or to offer specific or general comments
about how the design, organization, and usability of this resource might
be improved. Dialogue with my fellow book-lovers is a big part of what makes
this fun for me.<BR>
<BR>
Naturally, kudos are always welcome.<BR>

The heart is the keeper <BR>
Of those that have life. <BR>
It beats on through pleasure, <BR>
It beats on through strife. <BR>
<BR>
Blood ebbs and it flows, <BR>
And the pulse is produced, <BR>
Slowing down when you sleep, <BR>
Speeding up when you're goosed. <BR>
<BR>
Various factors <BR>
Influence its rate. <BR>
Speed up or slow down, <BR>
Each changes your fate. <BR>
<BR>
What do you think will do it? <BR>
Give us a clue, <BR>
And we'll get together <BR>
And work on it too. <BR>

If you would like to participate please email Debra Dimas, project administrator at<a href= mailto:ddimas@telis.org>ddimas@telis.org</a>
<p>

If you have already submitted an interest here are the steps you must follow:

<p>

1) Print out a copy of the <A HREF= http://ihnet.esuhsd.org/staff/dimasd/febsky.html>star finder for a macintosh</a> For IBM and other PCs<A HREF= http://ihnet.esuhsd.org/staff/dimasd/nightskyibm.html>Try this star finder </a>Right now this shows the night sky in one position with the reference star marked. Later there will be <A HREF= http://ihnet.esuhsd.org/staff/dimasd/starfinder.html>a copy of a star finder you can build</a> to see what the sky will look at during any particular night on any particular date. <p>A good starfinder calendar can be purchased through Abrams Planetarium by subscribing to their sky calendar. Simply send in a check for $7.50 made out to Michigan State University (also include where you want the sky charts sent) to Sky Calendar, Abrams Planetarium, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824. </bold>Allow 4-6 weeks for first delivery.

<p>

2) Print out a copy of the <A HREF= http://ihnet.esuhsd.org/staff/dimasd/parallax.html>parallax measuring device. </a> Print out the instructions too. This will allow you to measure angles between the stars and the moon. Always use the center side of the moon closest to the star chosen for measurements.

<p>

3) Look at this site for <A HREF="#current">current dates, reference stars, and times</a> for taking measurements.

<p>

4) Look up your lattitude and longitude at <A HREF=http://wings.buffalo.edu/geogw>Gazeteer</A>
Type in city and state ex. San Jose, California <br>
<P>
5) Submit your data using the <A HREF="#data">data table form</a>.
<P>
6) Read the <A HREF="#completed">completed data</a> 
<p>
7) Use data to determine the <A HREF="#how">
distance to the moon.</a>

<H2><A NAME="how">HOW TO USE POSTED RESULTS</A></H2>
<BR>
Use the following formula to determine your baseline distance between two locations in the United States:
<br>
cos(p)=cos(a)cos(b) +sin(a)sin(b)cos(P)
<br>
Where:<p>a=90-latitude(a)
<br>
b=90-latitude(b)<br>P=longitude(a)-longitude(b)
<br>
p=degrees and 1 degree=3147.5 miles
<p>
There are two methods you can use to determine the distance to the moon:
<p>
<bold>Method 1: Geometry</bold>
<br>
Draw the distance between the two locations to scale. Draw two parallel lines going straight up from the two locations (these lines represent the star light with we consider an infinite light source and therefore giving us parallel light). Next draw lines at the angles measured by the two locations (you need to know whether the moon was to the right or left of the star). Where the lines cross is the location of the moon. The distance from either location can now be measured and rescaled up to determine the actual distance. This method, which makes the most sense to the students, requires a LARGE piece of paper or a very small scale or both. 

<p>
<bold>Method 2: Trigonometry</bold>
<br>
In this method we assume the moon is directly over us and make a right triangle. The locations determine the base of the triangle and the moon is the third point. The difference between the two angles measured from each location is the angle at the top of the triangle. (This is because of the parallel light ideas again..if you draw the picture with the parallel light and triangle this ideas makes more sense). Since the tangent of the angle is equal to the opposite side of the triangle divided by the adjacent angle we get the formula : d = b/tan(theta), where d is the distance to the moon, b is the baseline distance between the two locations and theta is the difference between the two angles measured at each location.

<h2> DIRECTIONS</H2>
<P>
1)Copy the parallax measuring device onto stock paper or paste them onto a folder.

<P>
	
2) Cut out the two pieces.

<p>

3) Pin together with straight pin through the arrow so it is attached to the angle measurer and the cork at the bottom. 

4) Have students practice making measurements in the room between two objects at a far distance. A theater is great for this if you use diodes around on the chairs and a small flashlight on the stage as the "reference star" . They simply read the angle between the objects (Don't use the numbers just determine how many degrees are BETWEEN the objects.

<p>

5) Have the students practice finding constellations outside and measuring angles between the stars or between a star and the moon.

<p>

6) Have the students make actual measurements for the experiment. This should begin in January or February during 1st quarter through full moon.

<p>
<! Put Parallax measuring device here!>

<hr><p>

This WWW server, www.cahe.nmsu.edu. (a.k.a. Elroy, a.k.a. Rastro) is
located at Agricultural Communications, New Mexico State University.<p>

Originally, the WWW-based services were split up between two servers, named
Elroy and Rastro.  They are currently combined into a single server, and have
been named www.cahe.nmsu.edu.  The names 'Rastro' and
'Elroy' have been retained for connectivity purposes.<p>

This is now a dedicated machine, and serves all web pages for the
Agricultural Communications department.  It is a Macintosh Quadra 650 with
16MB of RAM running <a href="http://www.starnine.com">WebStar 1.2.1</a>.<p>

Want to see our <a href="stats.html">server statistics</a>?  (Slightly edited to
remove references to pages-in-progress and internal use documents.)<p>

The main purpose for this server is the <a href="cahe/Welcome.html"><b>College of
Agriculture and Home Economics Home Page</b></a>, although it houses several other
services, including:<p>

<h1>College Ambassadors<hr></h1>

  The College Ambassador program began in 1988 as a leadership opportunity for selected students
to represent and promote the programs and activities of the <a href="../../Welcome.html">
College of Agriculture and Home Economics</a>.  Ambassadors of the College of Agriculture promote
the College and assist in student recruitment.  Specific responsibilities consistent with
educational training, individual interests, competencies, and the needs of the College are
assigned to the ambassadors.  College Ambassadors:

<ul>
  <li>Recruit prospective students through activities such as making phone calls, giving campus
      and College tours, visiting high schools, county fairs, and other special events, and
      representing the College for Spring Visitors Day and new student programs;
  <li>Promote interdepartmental communications among students and faculty;
  <li>Serve as public speakers to university and community groups, classes, special events;
  <li>Represent the College at various receptions, activities, and functions;
  <li>And in general act as spokespersons for the students, the departments, the
      College, and the University.
</ul>

  Being a College Ambassador is a priveledge that requires enthusiasm, commitment, knowledge,
and a belief in the value and work of the College.  Ambassadors must be competent and
comfortable in a variety of settings, demonstrate diverse presentation skills, and exhibit
an interest and understanding of people.<p>

<h1>Agricultural Experiment Station (AES)<hr></h1>

The Agricultural Experiment Station is the research arm of the
<a href="../Welcome.html">College of Agriculture and Home Economics.</a>
Headquartered on the <a href="http://www.nmsu.edu">New Mexico State
University</a> (NMSU) main campus in Las Cruces, the Agricultural Experiment
Station is made up of researchers on the main campus and at <a href="AESctrrsh.html">
agricultural science centers and research centers</a> throughout the state.  (There
is a <a href="exp_map.html">clickable map</a> of the science centers and research
centers available.)  The off-campus centers support basic and applied research under
New Mexico's varied environmental conditions to meet the agricultural and natural
resource management needs of communities throughout the state.<p>

The research programs are designed to work cooperatively with
<a href="../ACP/Welcome.html">academic</a> and <a href="../CES/Welcome.html">Extension</a>
programs of the College of Agriculture and Home Economics.  The Agricultural Experiment
Station oversees research projects carried out by all departments of the College and
is a crucial element within the graduate instruction program.  Most of the scientists
of the Agricultural Experiment Station divide their time between teaching and research.
<p>

Administered by the Plant Genetics Engineering Laboratory (<strong>PGEL</strong>) in
conjunction with the NMSU Agricultural Experiment Station, The Southwest
Consortium for Plant Genetics and Water Resources, consisting of NMSU, the
University of California at Riverside, the University of Arizona, Texas Tech
University, and Los Alamos National Laboratory, funds research relevant to
arid and semi-arid adaptation.  The overall goal of the Consortium is to
bring together multidisciplinary scientific teams to develop innovative
advances in plant biotechnology and related areas in agriculture and water
management.
<p>

The Agricultural Experiment Station works cooperatively with research units
of three federal agencies: the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Agricultural Research Service
(ARS), and the Department of Interior's National Biological Service (NBS).
The NRCS Plant Materials Release Center is located at the Agricultural
Science Center at <a href="AESctrrsh.html#lunas">Los Lunas</a> and is closely
tied to our science center operations.  On the NMSU campus, ARS and NBS scientists
enjoy faculty status in the College.
<p>

The ARS Jornada Experimental Range and the College of Agriculture and Home
Economics' <a href="AESctrrsh.html#ranch">College Ranch</a> are participants in the National Science Foundation's
<a href="http://lternet.edu/about/sites/names.htm">Long-Term Ecological
Research</a> (LTER) program.  The NBS New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife
Research Unit is conducting gap analyses with the cooperation of the Agricultural
Experiment Station and NMSU's Remote Sensing Geographic Information Laboratory.
<p>

Along with the University of Arizona, the University of Illinois, South
Dakota State University, Texas A&M-Kingsville, and the Jewish National Fund,
NMSU is a founding member of the
<a href="http://ag.arizona.edu/OALS/IALC/NM.html">International Arid Lands
Consortium</a> (IALC).  The IALC researches the use of arid and semiarid lands
to evaluate problems from increased aridity.  The IALC also helps developing
nations foster sustainable resource practices.

<h2>Current Status</h2>

The Center for the Sustainable Development of Arid Lands (CSDAL) funding
process is moving forward.  Gary Cunningham (Agricultural Experiment
Station), Tim Nesbitt (CAHE Office of Business and Resource Planning), Ben
Woods (PPD), and Martin Hoffmeister (NMSU Architect) met last week with
USDA/CSREES administrators in Washington, D.C.  The proposal for federal
funds is due February 3, 1997.  NMSU is currently working on the proposal
and preliminary budget for the CSDAL.<p>

The CSDAL Users Committee has received several good suggestions from faculty
regarding use of the new building.  If you have suggestions about the CSDAL,
you can send your comments to me (<a href="mailto:sloring@nmsu.edu">sloring@nmsu.edu</a>)
and I will forward them
to the CSDAL Users Committee, or you can send them directly to the members
of the committee (Gary Cunningham, LeRoy Daugherty, Mike English, Grant
Kinzer).<p>

(Updated 12/16/96)<p>


<h2>For More Information</h2>

Arid Lands, contact Steve Loring at <a href="mailto:sloring@nmsu.edu">sloring@nmsu.edu</a>.<p>

Tracking statistics of Netscape vs. Other
Browsers<p>
<br clear=all><hr><p>

<table width=100%>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=50%>
The toolbar at the bottom of every page on the bottom of every
<a href="cahe/">College of Agriculture and Home Economics</a> web page is a good indication
of the number of files actually browsed by visiting users, since the counter is only
incremented once per visit, and it does not count peripheral files such as graphics and
animations being accessed.<p>

This page is used to track how often people are accessing our site via
<a href="http://home.netscape.com">Netscape</a> as opposed to other browsers, to see if
it is reasonable to use the Netscape extensions to HTML.<p>

'Mozilla' is the browser type Netscape uses to describe itself to servers.  Currently,
Netscape 2.0 was the highest non-beta version available, although many users were still
using Netscape 1.1N.  Mozilla 3 is now in beta, and we are, as of 8/22/96, starting to
track these hits as well (the Mozilla 3.0 numbers have about a two-month disadvantage).
(The three groups are mutually exclusive, so if you want the total number of Netscape accesses,
add the numbers.)<p>

'Non-Mozilla' refers to any http request that is not a Netscape user, such as users connecting
with Mosaic, CyberDog, Internet Explorer, AOL, Chameleon, or Lynx.  A significant
percentage of this number is generated by 'robots' designed to look at sites and record what
is there so that search engines (such as <a href="http://www.infoseek.com">Infoseek</a>
and <a href="http://www.inktomi.com">Inktomi</a>) can refer users to those sites.  They
tend to access a site many times a day.  I've screened out the major ones, but there are many
smaller robots which still add to this number.<p>

Currently, we are not differentiating between the non-Netscape accesses.  Accesses by the
web page developers are being screened out, so none of their test accesses are
incrementing the counters.<p>

Jan. 10, 1997--<a href="prichard_REDTT.html"> Prichard Joins NMSU's Rural Tourism Project</a><br>
Jennifer Prichard of Las Cruces began work last month as a program coordinator for New Mexico State University's Rural Economic Development Through Tourism (REDTT) project.<p>

Jan. 6, 1997--<a href="dormody_award.html"> NMSU Agricultural and Extension Education Associate Professor Teaching Award recipient</a><br>
Thomas Dormody, associate professor and agricultural and Extension education department head at New Mexico State University, received the Excellence in College and University Teaching in the Food and Agricultural Sciences Award.<p>

Dec. 20, 1996--<a href="todays_aggies.html">Faces of Today's Aggies Reflect Changing Makeup of NMSU's College of Agriculture and Home Economics</a><br>
Profiling a typical student from the College of Agriculture and Home Economics at New Mexico State University isn't as straightforward as it was 40 years ago, when Pistol Pete exemplified the student body of mostly male, rural New Mexicans.<p>

Dec. 20, 1996--<a href="sam_society.html">Nine NMSU Graduates from Las Cruces Inducted into the Sam Steel Society</a><br>

The following programs were distributed to radio stations.  If you would
like a cassette copy or printed script of any of these stories, please

or call (505) 646-2703.<p>

Week of Jan. 13, 1997:<br>

1. Whether ranchers raise ostriches, rheas or emus, the success of New Mexico's ratite industry will depend a great deal on finding markets. Rural Agricultural Improvement and Public Affairs Project Director Edmund Gomez with New Mexico State University's Cooperative Extension Service says the situation is a lot different than 10 years ago when the ratite market was booming.<p>

2. The list of restaurants that serve ratite dishes is growing, but New Mexico producers hope to sell the meat to more consumers in the near future. Project Director of Rural Agricultural Improvement and Public Affairs Edmund Gomez with New Mexico State University's Cooperative Extension Service says if ostrich is sold at a reasonable price, people probably will buy it.<p>

3. Lessons about good nutrition start early and stretch across the lifespan in two northern New Mexico counties. Family educators with the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program have San Miguel and Mora counties as their classroom.<p>

4. Farmers who never got around to a year-end tax estimate may find a few surprises as they put together their returns, but they still have a tax tool in the New Year. They can adjust how they deduct depreciation for machinery and equipment. <p>

5. Sipping cider from a roadside stand, buying fresh produce at a farmers market or visiting a pumpkin patch are experiences city dwellers savor. Northern District Director Gerald Chacon with New Mexico State University's Cooperative Extension Service says that's why selling directly to consumers is a growing business for farmers and ranchers.<p>

<h2>What is the Internet?</h2>

  The 'Internet' is simply a bunch of computers that can talk to each other.  The
  word 'Internet' refers to the collection of computers across the world which are
  all connected to each other via phone lines, cables, and satellite links, using
  a common language to transmit information from one machine to the next.  The
  Internet is not literally a 'place,' but it can be explored, and is often spoke
  of with a spatial metaphor, hence the slang term, 'CyberSpace.'<p>
  
  It's called a 'net' because it conjures images of a net when you consider how it
  works.  When you send a message to someone in Nepal, for example, it doesn't go
  straight there.  Your computer might hand it to a larger computer nearby which
  handles a lot of 'outgoing mail,' which in forwards it along to another machine,
  which hands it to a computer in New York, which hands it to a computer in the UK,
  and so on until it reaches Nepal.  Once it reaches Nepal, it keeps being handed
  down to various machines until it goes into the computer on your friend's desk.
  In this respect, the Internet is very much like the postal system.  When you send
  a letter, you put it in the mailbox.  It gets picked up by the local carrier, who
  in turn takes it to the city post office, which sends it to a larger office, where
  it is flown to, say, New York, where they see it needs to go overseas, so they ship
  it to the UK, who puts it on another flight to Nepal.  Once the letter is in Nepal,
  the mailpeople deliver it to the appropriate region, then to the appropriate town,
  building, and finally person.<p>
  
  Why does it do this?  Well, when the Internet was first invented, it was designed
  by the military to be a computer system that couldn't be knocked out by a single
  (or even five or six) strategic missiles.  Up until then, information systems were
  handled by one main computer that sent appropriate information to terminals
  connected to it.  If you destroy the main computer, everyone at the terminals are
  disconnected.  However, with the internet, everyone has their own computer, and
  the only way to completely disconnect someone is to disconnect everything it is
  connected to.  You can't take out some main computer in D.C. and cripple the
  people in Los Angeles.  This makes the Internet a powerful and surprisingly hardy
  information exchange system.<p>

  <a href="#toc">Back to Table of Contents</a>

<a name="www"></a><hr>
<h2>What is the World Wide Web?</h2>

  The World Wide Web (abbreviated 'WWW') is basically a bunch of files that are
  stored on machines on the Internet that are sent back and forth in the same manner
  that files are sent back and forth normally on the Internet.<P>
  
  Thus, the WWW is only part of the internet, so you are using the internet when
  you are using the WWW, but you are not necessarily using the WWW when you are
  using the internet.<p>
  
  The visible difference between the WWW and 'just plain internet' is that if you
  are using the WWW, you are using a special software program called a 'Web Browser.'
  A web browser will go out on the internet, find the files that you want, and it
  will take those files and make them look nice and simple for you.  For example, to
  see a picture over the Internet normally, you would have to type in a series of
  text commands and numbers to 'download' the picture, and then run a program on
  your local machine and select the picture file you wanted to see.  When you are
  using a 'Web Browser,' the program does all that for you; all you have to do is
  click once, and the browser will go out, get the picture, and display it for you.<p>
  
  The way the web browser knows how to make the document look nice is a series of
  invisible tags which the computer uses to know when to make text bold, where to
  put images, where to make big type and small, etc.  This system of tagging is
  called the 'HyperText Markup Language,' or 'HTML,' and is quite easy to learn -
  middle school children could easily pick it up.<p>

  By the way, if you are reading this, then chances are, you're using a web browser
  right now, because the document you are reading is all marked up with those
  invisible tags (which look pretty ugly when not viewed with a browser).<p>

  <img src="lil_cactus.gif" align="top" alt="*">
  <a href="#toc">Back to Table of Contents</a>

<a name="online"></a><hr>
<h2>What are Online Services?</h2>

  You may have heard of some 'Online Services' like <a href="http://webcrawler.com/AOL/">
  America Online</a>, <a href="http://www.prodigy.com/">Prodigy</a>,
  <a href="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</a>, and the like.  These are
  generally separate entities from the internet,
  places that you connect to directly with your computer, rather than letting your
  information pass from computer to computer until it gets to its destination.
  These online services are generally solutions for people who don't have normal
  internet access, or who want something user-friendly like the WWW.  The Online
  services generally provide 'gateway access' to the Internet as part of their
  service, namely, you can connect to the internet through their computer (as
  opposed to through your own).<p>
  
  Online services have much greater control over what goes on in their system, but
  do not have the sheer multitude of resources that the Internet has.  However,
  many online services provide services that are not available to the general
  Internet user.  For instance, America Online provides 'chat rooms,' which allow
  you to talk to several people all over the world in one virtual room.  While there
  are services like this on the Internet, they are not available in as user-
  friendly means as on America Online.  Also, many user-support groups meet on
  Online services regularly, and their discussions are not available to the
  general Internet community.<p>

  <img src="lil_cactus.gif" align="top" alt="*">
  <a href="#toc">Back to Table of Contents</a>

<a name="url"></a><hr>
<h2>What is a URL?</h2>

  The term 'URL' stands for 'Uniform Resource Locator,' and is basically a way for
  your WWW browser to locate the file you want on the web.  URL's generally look
  something like this:<P>
  
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  <b>http://rastro.nmsu.edu/SIMSE/intro.html</b>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  
  This is the URL for this page, so if you give any browser this address, it will
  open up this page.  Here's how it interprets the URL address:<P>
  
  <DL>
  <DT><b>http://</b>
  <DD>This tells the browser how it will get the document.  HTTP stands for
  'HyperText Transfer Protocol' and is generally the way WWW documents are sent
  back and forth.  Some other things you might see here are ftp, telnet, or
  mailto.
  <DT><b>rastro.nmsu.edu/</b>
  <DD>This is the computer where the file is stored on.  'Rastro' is the name of
  my macintosh machine in my office, 'nmsu.edu' means that any browser should look
  for rastro at the educational institution called NMSU.
  <DT><b>SIMSE</b>
  <DD>This is a folder on rastro, where the file is stored.
  <DT><b>intro.html</b>
  <DD>This is the actual filename.  The '.html' extension is used to indicate that
  this is a 'HyperText Markup Language' file, meaning it has all the special
  invisible tags in it.  This way, the browser knows what to do with the file once
  it gets it.  If the extension was '.gif,' which is the extension for graphic files,
  it would display the picture rather than try to interpret it as hypertext.
  </DL>
  
  So basically, a URL contains all the information that a browser needs to know in
  order to fetch and begin interpreting a given file on the internet.<P>
  
  What this means is that if you want to access a document that you found on the
  web later, or show it to a friend, you don't need to save the document.  All you
  have to do is write down (or cut and paste!) the URL, and send it to your friend,
  and then she can call up the same page with her web browser.  Thus, if you wanted
  to access this page later in the institute, you could just write down the URL, and
  then type it into the NetScape program later, and you would see this document
  again.<p>

<h1>SIMSE-relevant Net Resources</h1>

The following sites are a small collection of sites that contain information
that is relevant to Arid Lands.  While much of it is not designed for middle
school education, it contains a wealth of information that teachers can look
at, sift through, and eventually use in their classrooms.<P>

<ul>

<li> The <a href="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/phylogeny.html">Tree of
     Life</a> is a collection of WWW pages.  Each page contains
     information about a group of organisms: a phylogeny, introduction,
     characteristics, discussion of phylogenetic relationships, references, and
     so on.  The pages are linked together (with, for example, the terminal
     taxon name Green Plants on the Crown Eukaryotes page being a hypertext
     link to the Green Plants page), so that combined they form a phylogenetic
     tree of all living organisms.

<li> The <a href="http://www.swcp.com/nm/se.ws.html">White Sands Web Page</a>.

<li> The <a href="http://res.agr.ca/PUB/CANSIS/_overview.html">Canadian Soil
     Information Service</a> has a site with a lot of GIS datasets.

<li> The <a href="http://www.artdirect.com/sbbg">
     Santa Barbara Botanical Garden</a>. Contains a virtual tour of the gardens,
     several images, and a lot of intformation on plants from southern California.
     
<li> The <a href="http://bluehen.ags.udel.edu/udgarden.html">
     University of Deleware botanical gardens</a> has a large site, with many images.

<li> <a href="http://golgi.harvard.edu/biopages/botany.html>
     The Harvard Vitual Library Plan Biology section</a>.

<li> The <a href="http://www.isc.tamu.edu/FLORA/tfphome1.html">
     Texas A&M Botany 201 Web Page</a>, has hundreds of flower images, many 
     with various parts labeled, as well as online lectures, lab activities,
     and some other links.  A good example of how the WWW can enhance class
     resources.

<li> Ohio State University's <a href="http://hortwww-2.ag.ohio-state.edu/hvp/HVP1.html">
     Horticulture in Virtual Perspective</a> features images, on-line lectures,
     and other teaching materials.
      
<li> <a href=http://www.aloha.com/~virhol/>I.U.W.F.</a>
     is an excellent hydroponics link; it starts with a straightforward
     introduction to hyrdoponics, and continues with more resources.
     Unfortunately, it is fairly slow.

<li> <a href="http://newcrop.hort.purdue.edu>
     NewCrop Resource Online Program</a>.
     
<li> A list of <a href="http://ifs.plants.ox.ac.uk/sites.htm">
     jumping-off points</a> for biologists; it's a little slow, since it
     is over in the UK, but has many resources.
     
<li> <a href="http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/otherdocs/cgc/cgc.htm">
     The Cucurbit Genetics Cooperative Homepage</a> has some high-level stuff,
     which might be of interest to science teachers wanting to talk about genetics.

<li>The <a href="http://www.sedl.org/">Southwest Educational Development
        Laboratory</a>.

<Title>Dealing with Sensitive Materials on the Internet</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#f7d6b5">
<IMG SRC="cactus_line.gif">
<h1>Dealing with Sensitive Materials on the Internet</h1>

The Internet, from the very beginning, has been a tool for distributing a wide
variety of information across a large number of people, and until recently, has
not been a place where particularly young children would frequent.  With the
introduction of very user-friendly online systems and the World Wide Web, and
the introduction of the internet to the classroom, more
and more children are taking advantage of the power of the internet.  Its
potential for education, communication, and a sense of global community is
practically limitless.<p>

However, the Internet remains largely an adult forum, and so it carries with it
adult subjects.  This raises the question: what happens when the adult themes and
a child's naive explorations meet?  A while back, an article published in a national
news magazine detailing some of the pornography on the net and theorizing on the
sort of person who uses the net turned that question into a war that is being waged
on the internet, in children's homes, and on Capitol Hill.  The debate has raised
not only questions of obscenity, harassment, free speech, and censorship, but also
of government control over the Internet.<p>

Whatever legislation ends up being imposed in this arena, it will set a precedent for
how the government deals with the exchange of information in the future.  Is the
Internet a free forum for discussion, or is it a broadcasting service, and therefore
subject to the same restrictions as television, print, or radio?  Are
communications on the Internet covered by the right to privacy?  And who is
accountable for what happens on it?  How the issue of children and pornography on
the Internet is handled will have far-reaching ramifications on the way we live,
because eventually, all of us will be online.<p>

<b>What's the deal with all those black pages?</b><br>
In February, 1996, the Communications Decency Act was passed, a controversial bit
of legislation which you can find out plenty about in the links below.  Many
people find the CDA, as it is called, unconstitutional, and its passing prompted
an internet-wide protest where many people and organizations turned their web
pages black.  (This page is funded with public money, and thus did not participate
one way or the other - this is not the place to take political sides.)<p>

Since then, the CDA has been <a href="http://www.cdt.org/ciec/">challenged and
overturned</a>, but it still can be brought before the Supreme Court for a final
ruling on whether or not it is unconstitutional.  Currently, the CDA is not being
enforced, but several special interest groups are trying to bring it back.  Keep
that in mind while browsing the following links.<p>

Below is a series of resources I have collected regarding this debate.<p>

<ul>
    <LI>A list of <A HREF="ChildSecuremain.html">links</A> related to the
        question of pornography on the internet and children's access to it.
    <LI>An <A HREF="safetyarticle.html">article on making the internet
        safer for children</A>.
    <lI>The <a href="parentFAQ.html">Internet Parental Control FAQ</a>.
    <LI>A <A HREF="suggestions.html">list of suggestions</A> to low-tech
        parents about what they can do to prevent their children's access
        to questionable material on the net.  (Newsweek.)
    <LI>Some <A HREF="software.html">software and other resources</A> available
        for monitoring or blocking access to questionable material.

Many people seem to think that just because it's on the web, that it is in the
Public Domain.  This is just plain not true, and you could pay dearly if you
proceed under that assumption.  If you are doing any WWW development, or even
if you are doing any WWW surfing, it is worth your while to get the scoop on
what's legal and what's not.  Below are links to pages that deal with copyright
issues on the web.<p>

<h1>Green Gold: From the Maya to the Moon</h1>


Green Gold is a story of exploration, discovery, life, and death.  It traces the phenomenal
influence of three New World treasures -- corn, potatoes, and chile peppers -- on the lives
of our ancestors, on ourselves, and on the generations to come.  It poses the perplexing
question: Can we survive if we lose the genetically diverse, wild and weedy ancestors of
our valuable food crops?<p>
<img src="graphics/greengold1.jpeg" width=125 height=94 align=right>
<ul>
<li>Travel with internationally recognized plant explorers to the
mountains and marketplaces of Guatemala in search of the wild
relatives of the fiery chile pepper.<br>
<li>Discover what may have led to the collapse of the Mayan civilization, once
so dependent on its corn crop.<br>
<li>Hear culinary experts explain how New World crops have fed the human spirit and
improved our quality of life.<br>
<li>Look behind steel vault doors to glimpse living treasures worth more than all the
gold in Fort Knox.<br>

<h1>Evolution of the Rio Grande Valley:  Implications for Global Change</h1>


Rivers have always been sources of life and change in any land, but doubly so in 
parched, arid lands.  A casual glance proves this truth.  Even more important than how these
lifelines make history, is how they record it.<p>

With the help of computer animation and easy to understand scientist, Debbie Caskey, <i>Evolution of the Rio Grande
</I> focuses on the 1960's "Desert Project".<p>

In this video, learn:
<ul>
	<li> How ice ages impacted river valleys thousands of miles away in hot deserts.<br>
	<li> How a river's history helps explain global climatic changes.<br>
	<li> How caliche traces in soil reveal how land formed.<br>
	<li> Why the needle of a compass hasn't always pointed "north."<br>
	<li> How volcanos from across the country help date river valley rock formations.<br>
</ul>

Tour this landmark research for yourself and see why
scientists all over the world look to the 
work done in the Rio Grande Valley to guide their explorations.<p>

<h1>The Seamless Society</h1>


Decades ago, futurists predicted that our society would change greatly before 
the next millennium due to technological advances.  Today that scenario has 
become a reality for many and it is most evident in the American workplace.<p>
 <br clear=all>
<img src="graphics/seamless4.jpeg" width=128 height=129 align=right>
<ul>
<li>Travel to a monastery in the New Mexico desert and see how 
technology links the rest of the world to even a remote group 
of Benedictine monks.<br>
<li>Witness the extraordinary efforts of community activist 
Antonia Stone, as she strives to bring computer technology 
to inner-city Boston residents so they can compete in today's workplace.<br>
<li>Meet Merrill Jannison, a resident of a picturesque island in Puget Sound.  
She runs a successful 1.5 million dollar regional business, but rarely leaves
 her waterfront home.<br>
<li>Enter the corporate world of AT&T's New Jersey headquarters to see how
 today's managers deal with telecommuters - the new invisible employees.<br>
<li>Follow CEO Dick Grove as he leaves his Kansas City firm behind to venture 
Rocky Mountain roads on his Harley, staying in touch with his virtual office.<br>
</ul>
<img src="graphics/seamless3.jpeg" width=125 height=94 align=right>

    What are the consequences of this new method of doing business?  How has
     it liberated workers and managers alike, and what are the down sides of 
     such change?  Join host Lowell Catlett as he explores these and other 
     questions on <i>The Changing American Workplace,</i> Episode One of <i>The Seamless Society.</i><p>
     
<br clear=all>

<H1>Guidelines for Exemplary Mathematics, Science, and Technology Lessons<hr></H1>

This page contains evaluation tools for looking at your Math and Science curricula.
The resources on this page are a combination of the <a href="../simse/">SIMSE</a>
<b>Math and Science Curriculum Evaluation Tool</b> and some resources put together
by teachers under the USWEST grant.  The SIMSE guidelines are presented verbatim,
while the teachers' guidelines have been paraphrased and edited.<p>

<hr><p>

<a href="simsecurr.html"><h2>SIMSE Math and Science Curriculum Evaluation Tool</h2></a>

The SIMSE Math and Science Curriculum Evaluation Tool is presented in its entirety
on another page, so it can be printed and used.<p>

<hr><p>

<h2>A Checklist</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Look over the <a href="simsecurr.html">SIMSE guidelines</a> for exemplary math
       and science lessons and make sure what you plan meets these criteria. 
  <li> Are the activities designed to meet the needs of the students you teach?
       The students in your community?
  <li> Do the activities reflect the latest national and state standards for the
       teaching of mathematics and science?
  <li> Is the technology used to teach something that would be difficult to teach
       without the technology?
  <li> Are the concepts being taught worth teaching?
  <li> Do the proposed learning activities promote and value a variety of ways
       for students to demonstrate their knowledge?
  <li> Do the proposed learning activities require higher-level thinking (application,
       analysis, synthesis, and/or evaluation)?
</ul>

<hr><p>

<h2>Thematic Teaching Template</h2>

<h2>What is the Internet?</h2>

  The 'Internet' is simply a bunch of computers that can talk to each other.  The
  word 'Internet' refers to the collection of computers across the world which are
  all connected to each other via phone lines, cables, and satellite links, using
  a common language to transmit information from one machine to the next.  The
  Internet is not literally a 'place,' but it can be explored, and is often spoke
  of with a spatial metaphor, hence the slang term, 'CyberSpace.'<p>
  
  It's called a 'net' because it conjures images of a net when you consider how it
  works.  When you send a message to someone in Nepal, for example, it doesn't go
  straight there.  Your computer might hand it to a larger computer nearby which
  handles a lot of 'outgoing mail,' which in forwards it along to another machine,
  which hands it to a computer in New York, which hands it to a computer in the UK,
  and so on until it reaches Nepal.  Once it reaches Nepal, it keeps being handed
  down to various machines until it goes into the computer on your friend's desk.
  In this respect, the Internet is very much like the postal system.  When you send
  a letter, you put it in the mailbox.  It gets picked up by the local carrier, who
  in turn takes it to the city post office, which sends it to a larger office, where
  it is flown to, say, New York, where they see it needs to go overseas, so they ship
  it to the UK, who puts it on another flight to Nepal.  Once the letter is in Nepal,
  the mailpeople deliver it to the appropriate region, then to the appropriate town,
  building, and finally person.<p>
  
  Why does it do this?  Well, when the Internet was first invented, it was designed
  by the military to be a computer system that couldn't be knocked out by a single
  (or even five or six) strategic missiles.  Up until then, information systems were
  handled by one main computer that sent appropriate information to terminals
  connected to it.  If you destroy the main computer, everyone at the terminals are
  disconnected.  However, with the internet, everyone has their own computer, and
  the only way to completely disconnect someone is to disconnect everything it is
  connected to.  You can't take out some main computer in D.C. and cripple the
  people in Los Angeles.  This makes the Internet a powerful and surprisingly hardy
  information exchange system.<p>

<a name="www"></a><hr>
<h2>What is the World Wide Web?</h2>

  The World Wide Web (abbreviated 'WWW') is basically a bunch of files that are
  stored on machines on the Internet that are sent back and forth in the same manner
  that files are sent back and forth normally on the Internet.<P>
  
  Thus, the WWW is only part of the internet, so you are using the internet when
  you are using the WWW, but you are not necessarily using the WWW when you are
  using the internet.<p>
  
  The visible difference between the WWW and 'just plain internet' is that if you
  are using the WWW, you are using a special software program called a 'Web Browser.'
  A web browser will go out on the internet, find the files that you want, and it
  will take those files and make them look nice and simple for you.  For example, to
  see a picture over the Internet normally, you would have to type in a series of
  text commands and numbers to 'download' the picture, and then run a program on
  your local machine and select the picture file you wanted to see.  When you are
  using a 'Web Browser,' the program does all that for you; all you have to do is
  click once, and the browser will go out, get the picture, and display it for you.<p>
  
  The way the web browser knows how to make the document look nice is a series of
  invisible tags which the computer uses to know when to make text bold, where to
  put images, where to make big type and small, etc.  This system of tagging is
  called the 'HyperText Markup Language,' or 'HTML,' and is quite easy to learn -
  middle school children could easily pick it up.<p>

  By the way, if you are reading this, then chances are, you're using a web browser
  right now, because the document you are reading is all marked up with those
  invisible tags (which look pretty ugly when not viewed with a browser).<p>

  <img src="lil_cactus.gif" align="top" alt="*">
  <a href="#toc">Back to Table of Contents</a>

<a name="online"></a><hr>
<h2>What are Online Services?</h2>

  You may have heard of some 'Online Services' like <a href="http://webcrawler.com/AOL/">
  America Online</a>, <a href="http://www.prodigy.com/">Prodigy</a>,
  <a href="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</a>, and the like.  These are
  generally separate entities from the internet,
  places that you connect to directly with your computer, rather than letting your
  information pass from computer to computer until it gets to its destination.
  These online services are generally solutions for people who don't have normal
  internet access, or who want something user-friendly like the WWW.  The Online
  services generally provide 'gateway access' to the Internet as part of their
  service, namely, you can connect to the internet through their computer (as
  opposed to through your own).<p>
  
  Online services have much greater control over what goes on in their system, but
  do not have the sheer multitude of resources that the Internet has.  However,
  many online services provide services that are not available to the general
  Internet user.  For instance, America Online provides 'chat rooms,' which allow
  you to talk to several people all over the world in one virtual room.  While there
  are services like this on the Internet, they are not available in as user-
  friendly means as on America Online.  Also, many user-support groups meet on
  Online services regularly, and their discussions are not available to the
  general Internet community.<p>

  <img src="lil_cactus.gif" align="top" alt="*">
  <a href="#toc">Back to Table of Contents</a>

<a name="url"></a><hr>
<h2>What is a URL?</h2>

  The term 'URL' stands for 'Uniform Resource Locator,' and is basically a way for
  your WWW browser to locate the file you want on the web.  URL's generally look
  something like this:<P>
  
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  <b>http://rastro.nmsu.edu/SIMSE/intro.html</b>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  
  This is the URL for this page, so if you give any browser this address, it will
  open up this page.  Here's how it interprets the URL address:<P>
  
  <DL>
  <DT><b>http://</b>
  <DD>This tells the browser how it will get the document.  HTTP stands for
  'HyperText Transfer Protocol' and is generally the way WWW documents are sent
  back and forth.  Some other things you might see here are ftp, telnet, or
  mailto.
  <DT><b>rastro.nmsu.edu/</b>
  <DD>This is the computer where the file is stored on.  'Rastro' is the name of
  my macintosh machine in my office, 'nmsu.edu' means that any browser should look
  for rastro at the educational institution called NMSU.
  <DT><b>SIMSE</b>
  <DD>This is a folder on rastro, where the file is stored.
  <DT><b>intro.html</b>
  <DD>This is the actual filename.  The '.html' extension is used to indicate that
  this is a 'HyperText Markup Language' file, meaning it has all the special
  invisible tags in it.  This way, the browser knows what to do with the file once
  it gets it.  If the extension was '.gif,' which is the extension for graphic files,
  it would display the picture rather than try to interpret it as hypertext.
  </DL>
  
  So basically, a URL contains all the information that a browser needs to know in
  order to fetch and begin interpreting a given file on the internet.<P>
  
  What this means is that if you want to access a document that you found on the
  web later, or show it to a friend, you don't need to save the document.  All you
  have to do is write down (or cut and paste!) the URL, and send it to your friend,
  and then she can call up the same page with her web browser.  Thus, if you wanted
  to access this page later in the institute, you could just write down the URL, and
  then type it into the NetScape program later, and you would see this document
  again.<p>

<h1>SIMSE-relevant Net Resources</h1>

The following sites are a small collection of sites that contain information
that is relevant to Arid Lands.  While much of it is not designed for middle
school education, it contains a wealth of information that teachers can look
at, sift through, and eventually use in their classrooms.<P>

<ul>

<li> The <a href="http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/tree/phylogeny.html">Tree of
     Life</a> is a collection of WWW pages.  Each page contains
     information about a group of organisms: a phylogeny, introduction,
     characteristics, discussion of phylogenetic relationships, references, and
     so on.  The pages are linked together (with, for example, the terminal
     taxon name Green Plants on the Crown Eukaryotes page being a hypertext
     link to the Green Plants page), so that combined they form a phylogenetic
     tree of all living organisms.

<li> The <a href="http://www.swcp.com/nm/se.ws.html">White Sands Web Page</a>.

<li> The <a href="http://res.agr.ca/PUB/CANSIS/_overview.html">Canadian Soil
     Information Service</a> has a site with a lot of GIS datasets.

<li> The <a href="http://www.artdirect.com/sbbg">
     Santa Barbara Botanical Garden</a>. Contains a virtual tour of the gardens,
     several images, and a lot of intformation on plants from southern California.
     
<li> The <a href="http://bluehen.ags.udel.edu/udgarden.html">
     University of Deleware botanical gardens</a> has a large site, with many images.

<li> <a href="http://golgi.harvard.edu/biopages/botany.html>
     The Harvard Vitual Library Plan Biology section</a>.

<li> The <a href="http://www.isc.tamu.edu/FLORA/tfphome1.html">
     Texas A&M Botany 201 Web Page</a>, has hundreds of flower images, many 
     with various parts labeled, as well as online lectures, lab activities,
     and some other links.  A good example of how the WWW can enhance class
     resources.

<li> Ohio State University's <a href="http://hortwww-2.ag.ohio-state.edu/hvp/HVP1.html">
     Horticulture in Virtual Perspective</a> features images, on-line lectures,
     and other teaching materials.
      
<li> <a href=http://www.aloha.com/~virhol/>I.U.W.F.</a>
     is an excellent hydroponics link; it starts with a straightforward
     introduction to hyrdoponics, and continues with more resources.
     Unfortunately, it is fairly slow.

<li> <a href="http://newcrop.hort.purdue.edu>
     NewCrop Resource Online Program</a>.
     
<li> A list of <a href="http://ifs.plants.ox.ac.uk/sites.htm">
     jumping-off points</a> for biologists; it's a little slow, since it
     is over in the UK, but has many resources.
     
<li> <a href="http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/otherdocs/cgc/cgc.htm">
     The Cucurbit Genetics Cooperative Homepage</a> has some high-level stuff,
     which might be of interest to science teachers wanting to talk about genetics.

<Title>Dealing with Sensitive Materials on the Internet</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#f7d6b5">
<IMG SRC="cactus_line.gif">
<h1>Dealing with Sensitive Materials on the Internet</h1>

The Internet, from the very beginning, has been a tool for distributing a wide
variety of information across a large number of people, and until recently, has
not been a place where particularly young children would frequent.  With the
introduction of very user-friendly online systems and the World Wide Web, and
the introduction of the internet to the classroom, more
and more children are taking advantage of the power of the internet.  Its
potential for education, communication, and a sense of global community is
practically limitless.<p>

However, the Internet remains largely an adult forum, and so it carries with it
adult subjects.  This raises the question: what happens when the adult themes and
a child's naive explorations meet?  A while back, an article published in a national
news magazine detailing some of the pornography on the net and theorizing on the
sort of person who uses the net turned that question into a war that is being waged
on the internet, in children's homes, and on Capitol Hill.  The debate has raised
not only questions of obscenity, harassment, free speech, and censorship, but also
of government control over the Internet.<p>

Whatever legislation ends up being imposed in this arena, it will set a precedent for
how the government deals with the exchange of information in the future.  Is the
Internet a free forum for discussion, or is it a broadcasting service, and therefore
subject to the same restrictions as television, print, or radio?  Are
communications on the Internet covered by the right to privacy?  And who is
accountable for what happens on it?  How the issue of children and pornography on
the Internet is handled will have far-reaching ramifications on the way we live,
because eventually, all of us will be online.<p>

<b>What's the deal with all those black pages?</b><br>
In February, 1996, the Communications Decency Act was passed, a controversial bit
of legislation which you can find out plenty about in the links below.  Many
people find the CDA, as it is called, unconstitutional, and its passing prompted
an internet-wide protest where many people and organizations turned their web
pages black.  (This page is funded with public money, and thus did not participate
one way or the other - this is not the place to take political sides.)<p>

Since then, the CDA has been <a href="http://www.cdt.org/ciec/">challenged and
overturned</a>, but it still can be brought before the Supreme Court for a final
ruling on whether or not it is unconstitutional.  Currently, the CDA is not being
enforced, but several special interest groups are trying to bring it back.  Keep
that in mind while browsing the following links.<p>

Below is a series of resources I have collected regarding this debate.<p>

Below are a list of pointers to various internet-accessible software packages
which interested teachers might use in their classrooms.<p>

Before you can download these files, you will need a copy of Stuffit Expander,
which is annoyingly difficult to find on the web in an uncompressed form.  I
am currently trying to figure out how to make it downloadable to you.<p>

  <li><b>Sound Utilities</b><br>
      Before you can record sounds in these programs, you will need to get a hold
      of a microphone.  Many Macs come with one.  There should be a microphone
      jack in the back of your machine to use.  If you don't have a microphone,
      remember that you can play MacGyver and use a set of headphones instead!

  Well, here's the scoop:<p>

  You can't put sounds and video clips <b>in</b> your web pages (yet) in the
same way you can put images in.  Right now, about all you can do is set
up a 'link' to a sound file or a video file on your server, and trust
that the people wishing to hear/view them have their browsers configured
to handle them.<p>

  If you have configured your browsers to view digital movies and hear
sound files, you're set; all you have to do is ftp the sound file or the
quicktime movie to the server, and then, when people click on the link,
their browser will download the file, and play it locally.  Your link
(for music) would look like this:<p>

<center>
  &lta href="theme.au"&gtmusic&lt/a&gt
</center><p>

(This is an actual link from my home page at: http://rastro.nmsu.edu/cc/)
For a quicktime movie, you would have something like this:<p>

<center>
  &lta href="packers.qt"&gtGreen Bay Packer getting sacked&lt/a&gt
</center><p>

  If you have NOT configured your browsers yet, you need to do two things:<p>

<ol>
  <li> Get 'helper applications' for each type of file you wish to view
       via the WWW.  On the macs, the good one to get is called 'Sound
       Machine.'  There is a place you can download it, along with some
       instructions, at:<p>

       <a href="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/Cookbook/Sounds/Sounds.html">
       http://web66.coled.umn.edu/Cookbook/Sounds/Sounds.html</a><p>

       (You can also download it from the <a href="archive.html">USWEST
       grant archive</a> on this site.)<p>

       For QuickTime movies, you can simply use 'MoviePlayer,' which
       you should already have on your machine.<p>

       (One thing you need to do is locate a copy of 'Stuffit Expander.'
       This is no small task, since all the WWW sites with it have
       compressed versions, for some reason.  'Stuffit Expander' is the
       software you need to download just about any mac-related file
       off of the WWW.)<p>

  <li> Configure your browser to use the helper application when it
       encounters sound or QuickTime files.  Chances are your browser
       already points to MoviePlayer for digital video, but just to be
       sure, launch Netscape, and open your 'Preferences' in the Options
       menu.  Once inside 'Preferences,' choose 'Helper Applications'
       from the pop-up menu.  This will bring up a list of many of the
       file types Netscape expects to run into as you surf the web.  You
       can then tell Netscape what to do with sounds and movies.<p>

       Sound files generally end in .au, .snd, .aif, or .aiff.  The
       SoundMachine application can handle all four.  QuickTime movies
       generally end in .mov or .qt.  So, make sure you have lines in
       your Helper Applications list that read:<p>

       <pre>
       Mine/Type        Application      Action     Extensions
       ----------------------------------------------------------
       audio/x-aiff     Sound Machine    Launch     aif,aiff
       audio/basic      Sound Machine    Launch     au,snd
       video/quicktime  MoviePlayer      Launch     mov,qt
       ----------------------------------------------------------
       </pre><p>
       
       You should be able to figure out how to do this; the interface is
       pretty self-explanatory.  You just type in 'audio' and 'x-aiff' in
       the little dialogue box that comes up when you edit lines, and
       then select the application in a standard file selection dialogue
       box for the Application.  You can type directly into the extensions
       field, and you select the 'Action' radio button.<p>
</ol>

  Once you have done these two things, you should be able to view sound
and quicktime files on your macines.  After that, it's just a matter of
putting the files on your server, and making sure your web administrator
serves documents of that type (which he probably does by default - try it
before you call him/her).<p>

  Here's a <a href="../cc/theme.au">sound test</a>.<p>

<h2>How do I create sounds for my web pages on a Mac?</h2></a>

Creating sounds isn't too bad on a Mac.  On the <a href="archive.html">
USWEST Grant Archive</a> on this server, you can find pointers to several
internet-available programs for recording and editing sound.  (You will
need 'Stuffit Expander.')<p>

Once you have some sound editing software, the next step is to record your
sound:<P>

First, get a microphone.  Many Macs come with microphones, but if you don't
have a microphone, you can get a cheapoid one from Radio Shack or WalMart
pretty cheaply, I would imagine.  In a pinch, you can play MacGuyver and use a
set of headphones for a microphone if you need to, although there's no
guarantee of sound quality with this approach.<p>

Plug the microphone in the microphone jack in the back of your Mac.  You may
have to fiddle with the options in the Sound Control Panel some to get it to
work.  You probably don't want playthrough checked, and you might need to select
a microphone checkbox or radio button somewhere in the innards of the control
panel.  I am using System 7.5, which has its own 'Sound In' entry in the pop-up
menu.  From there, you can open the 'Built-In' options, which allows you to select
an external microphone and disable playthrough.  If you experience problems
with recording sounds, the Sound Control panel is the first place to start
fiddling with things.<p>

Open your sound-editing software.  Generally, there will be a menu item option
to record a sound.  Select this, and you will be presented with a standard
digitizing interface, including a record button, a play button, a stop button,
etc.  To record your sound, press the record button, make your sound, and then
press the stop button.  Press the play button to hear the sound.<p>

Once you get out of the digitizer dialog box, your sound will be opened as a
document in the sound editor.  From here, you can save the file to your hard
drive.  If you can, save it in .au format, but it is more likely that you will
be saving it in .aiff format.  Make sure you append the correct extension to
the file name (.au or .aiff).<P>

That's all there is to it.  Your sound editor will allow you to crop silence
from the beginning and ending of your sound, which will make it download
better.  To reduce the size, you can 'sample' at 11kHz instead of 22kHz, which
basically gives you less clean sound in exchange for saving space.<p>

To reference the sound in your home page, follow the instructions in the
previous question above.<p>

<h2>How do I create digital video for my web pages on a Mac?</h2></a>

Question submitted by:  <a href="mailto:bbooth@tesuque.cs.sandia.gov">Beth Booth</a><br>
Date submitted:  Wed, 25 Oct 1995<p>

Creating digital video is considerably more difficult than creating sounds.
Here's what you will need:<p>

<ul>
  <li>A video camera, if you want to create original digital video.
  <li>A VCR to play the video on so the computer can capture it.
  <li>Something to accept the video coming in, which can be:<ul>
    <li>an AV Macintosh (i.e. Quadra 840AV), or
    <li>a video digitizer card for your Mac.</ul>
  <li>The 'QuickTime' extension, inside your system folder.
  <li>Some digitizing/compression software.
  <li>A copy of 'MoviePlayer' or other QuickTime playback tool.
  <li>(Optional) Some QuickTime editing tools, such as Adobe Premiere.
</ul>

  Let's take those items one by one.<p>
  
<h3>A Video Camera</h3>

  If you are going to try to create original digital video (as opposed to digitizing
  something off of an existing tape), you will need something to capture the video
  with.  Probably, this will be a video camera.  Before making a major shoot, you
  should try digitizing something off of an existing tape, just to make sure you can
  do it.<p>
  
  Once you go to shoot something, try to avoid the following wherever possible:<p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Moving backgrounds.
    <li>Pans, tilts, and zooms.
    <li>Changing light conditions.
    <li>A lot of action in the whole screen.
  </ul>
  
  Those conditions will cause your movie to not compress well.  Instead, try to
  minimize the amount of change in the picture from one frame to the next; this
  will help reduce the size of your final movie, helping to save space on your
  hard drive, and reducing download time for people visiting your web pages.<p>
  
<h3>A VCR</h3>

  Just about any playback machine will work, including VCR's, Beta Decks, and
  especially LaserDisc players.  You will need to find the appropriate cable
  to go from your source machine to the back of your computer.<p>

<h3>Something to accept the video</h3>

  Once you have a source machine, you need to hook up the VIDEO OUT from the
  source machine and feed it into the VIDEO IN on your Mac.<P>
  
  The AV Quadras and AV PowerMacs have 'video in' support already.  In the back
  of the machine, there will be a socket to connect a Video In cable to, and
  the incoming video will be digitized on the fly.  (The AV machines probably
  come with digital video capture software, as well.)<p>
  
  If you don't have an AV Mac, you are pretty much stuck unless you can get a
  'video digitizer' card to put in your Mac.  Basically, this card is just an
  add-on to the internal workings of your Mac to make it an AV.  Once installed,
  it will have a Video In jack, as well.  Look in standard Mac Catalogs for the
  cards.  Once you purchase a card, you will get the software to drive it.<p>
  
<h3>QuickTime</h3>

  You need to make sure you have a fairly recent (1.6 or later) version of
  QuickTime installed.  QuickTime is Apple's digital video technology, and you
  probably have a copy lying around somewhere, since many applications require
  it.  It needs to be located in your system folder, and you should use the
  latest version possible (find the version by selecting the QuickTime Extension
  icon, and pressing Command-I).<p>
  
  The QuickTime extension contains the software that compresses the video signal
  down into something the computer can handle.  You see, if you simply saved every
  frame of a QuickTime movie, it would take up your whole drive, and the computer
  wouldn't be able to put all the data to your screen in real time.  It would look
  jerky, and it would be huge.<p>
  
  What the QuickTime extension does is it uses a 'codec' (which stands for a
  compressor/decompressor) to reduce the huge amount of information that is
  required to display video.  Usually, this involves only saving what changes
  from frame to frame, rather than all of each frame.  (This is why pans and tilts
  are to be avoided, since the entire frame changes when you are panning.)  Some
  codecs, under the right circumstances, can compress the video down to a 1:25
  ratio!<p>
  
  Once it is compressed, the codec is still needed to decompress the movie so
  that when you play it back, it looks like the original (or a close approximation
  of it).<p>

<h3>Digitizing/compression software</h3>

  Once you have your system set up, with a source machine feeding into your
  digitizer and QuickTime loaded, start up your digitizing software.  I believe
  the AV Macs come with a utility called 'VideoFusion Recorder' or some such
  which will suffice.  If you purchased a card, use the software that came with
  the card.<p>
  
  The software should allow you to select which codec you want by selecting
  'Compression options' or 'Save As' options, or something similar.  A dialogue
  box will come up with a list of the available codecs.  In almost all cases,
  you will want to choose 'Cinepak,' or perhaps 'Apple Video' when you are
  digitizing video.  (The other codecs are for single-frame images, no-loss
  compression, and computer-generated animations.)<p>
  
  Also in the dialogue box will be some options as to what color depth you
  want, and what quality you want.  Generally, the fewer colors and the less
  quality, the smaller the resulting file size.  Note, however, that often, the
  file size can be increased by reducing quality (never by reducing colors),
  so some experimentation is in order.<p>
  
  Once you have your codec options set, use your software to actually capture
  the video.  Chances are, you will have a window showing the video coming in,
  and you just click on a button that says, 'Digitize,' and when you are done,
  you just click the mouse again.  It's that simple (the hard part is getting
  set up!)<p>
  
<h3>'MoviePlayer' or other QuickTime playback tool</h3>

  In order to see your QuickTime movie, you will need 'MoviePlayer' or some
  other QuickTime viewer.  Chances are, you can get MoviePlayer wherever you
  got QuickTime.  (In fact, it's probably sitting on your hard drive.)<p>
  
  You can use MoviePlayer to do some simple editing to your QuickTime movies,
  by copying and pasting snippets out of movies into a new file.  However,
  be sure to save your movie as self-contained, or else it won't play for your
  fans on the web!<p>

<h3>(Optional) QuickTime editing tools, such as Adobe Premiere</h3>

  Finally, if you want some cool transitions, text effects, morphs, etc., you
  will need to get your hands on some more sophisticated editing tools such as
  Adobe Premiere.  These programs do not come cheap, but if you can fanagle
  someone into purchasing a copy, it will really open up your digital video
  capabilities.<p>

<h2>How do I create GIF images from slides?</h2></a>

</pre>

You have several options, actually.  The first, and probably the easiest, would be
to scan the slides using a slide scanner.  If you have one at your school, that is
the way to go.  If not, you could try to twist your administrator's arm and have
him/her cough up the bucks for one; Polaroid makes one for about $1700.<p>

If you don't have a slide scanner but you have a flatbed scanner, you can probably
get prints made out of a slide at your local photo-processing outfit, which you can
then scan with the flatbed scanner.  I believe that even places like Walgreen's or
Smith's will be able to do this.<p>

If you're still stuck, then there are several service bureaus which will convert
slides, or rolls of slide film, into a PhotoCD CD-ROM, which will then contain a
small archive of the photos you send them.  About a year ago, this would have cost
about $2 a slide, but the price seems to have dropped considerably since then.<p>

(Phototech supposedly will do 24 slides, or a 24-exposure roll of slide film, for
$15, plus $2.50 S+H.  Their phone number is 1-800-977-9077; they are located in
Salt Lake City.  There are likely other service bureaus closer, but I don't know
any offhand.)<p>

The drawback to this is that you have to mail them off and wait for them to be
returned.  However, those photos are at your fingertips for years to come, and they
don't take up space on your hard drive.  This is a <b>good</b> option, even though
it takes a little money, because it becomes a permanent classroom resource you
can use.<p>

Once you have your image in your computer, then you can use utilities like
GraphicConverter, PhotoShop, Debabelizer, etc., to convert the image into
Compuserve GIF format.<p>

  Here are some tentative guidelines for the College's web pages.  We will be
  meeting soon to develop the actual guidelines for the College, but these
  should at least serve as a suggestion until the actual guidelines are
  released.  (So far, the members of the Web Guidelines Advisory Group include
  C.C. Chamberlin, Cathy Montes, Shane Ball, Tim Jones, Barbara Copeland,
  Allen Torell, Scott Ramsey, Mark Andersen, David Richman, Steve Loring,
  Kathleen Kelsey, and Wendy Hamilton; if you are in the CAHEWUG, and wish to
  join, <a href="mailto:cc@acca.nmsu.edu">let me know</a>!)<p>
  
  Before you continue, you should be somewhat familiar with the basics of
  HTML.  A good place to start is <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">
  A Beginner's Guide to HTML</a>, which contains an introduction to hypertext
  markup, giving you the basics for creating web documents.<p>

  </ul>
<a name="general"><hr>
<h2>General Guidelines</h2></a>
  
 <dl>
   <dt><b>Unambiguous Title</b>
   <dd>Many people decide on the basis of what is in the first couple of
       sentences of a web page whether or not to read it.  A big help for
       them is to have an unambiguous title for the page, and have it
       appear not only as the title of the page, but also at the top of
       the page as well.  (For instance, in this page, the title of the
       document, which is usually printed in the window's drag bar, is
       'CAHEWUG WWW Guidelines,' but you'll also find the page title as
       the first line in the document, since few people actually read
       the page title as it appears in the drag bar.
   <dt><b>Attribution</b>
   <dd>Every page should have, at the bottom, contact information for the
       person who created or maintains the page.  Generally, you can do
       this with simply an email address.  (View the source of this
       document and look at the bottom for how to make it so that when
       you click on the email address, you can send an email address.)  This
       is important so that people viewing your pages can ask for more
       information, point out errors, or ask you for permission to use
       the information you are providing.  If you are maintaining the
       page, but did not author the content, be prepared to forward
       messages on to the specialist.
   <dt><b>Date Last Modified</b>
   <dd>People who access your web page have no idea how old the information
       on your page is, or how often you update it.  A good way to let people
       know how current your information is, beyond putting dates in the
       text of your message, is to put the date the document was last
       modified at the bottom of the page, along with the attribution.
   <dt><b>Browser-specific Courtesies</b>
   <dd>Ideally, anyone using a web browser should be able to use your
       entire web page.  However, with Netscape and Microsoft coming out
       with their own standards for HTML, this may not always be possible,
       so if there is vital information on your page which cannot be
       displayed by your basic HTML browser, point that out with a
       message like, 'Viewing this file requires Netscape.'  This is
       especially true with things that require plug-in support like
       Macromedia's Shockwave and Sun's JavaScript, where you should
       put links to the required plug-ins for people to follow if they
       don't have them.
   <dt><b>'Backward' Buttons</b>
   <dd>There should always be buttons to return to higher levels of your
       web site and to your site's main page.  Sure, most browsers have a
       'back' button, but if a user reaches your page via a search instead
       of through your web hierarchy, pressing 'back' won't go back a level
       in your hierarchy; it will just send them back to the page that
       referred them to your page.  A few lines at the end of a document
       is generally sufficient.
   <dt><b>Reasonable Graphics</b>
   <dd>Even if it shows up quickly in your office, your web pages may take
       several minutes to see for people in remote locations or who are using
       modems.  And nothing makes a page take longer to view than graphics.
       Any graphics you have on your page should be <b>small</b> (both in size
       and color depth) and <b>pertinent</b>.  Don't include graphics that
       do not:<p>
         <ul>
           <li>Contribute directly to the content of your page
           <li>Help to identify or unify your web site
           <li>Specifically contribute to an artistic effect
         </ul><p>
       The further down this list you get, the smaller the graphic should be.
       If you wish to include large or high-resolution images, put a tiny
       thumbnail on your page which you can click on to view the larger image.

<h2>College-Specific Guidelines</h2></a>

  <dl>
    <dt><b>Color Coordination (Optional)</b>
    <dd>The main college page has been set up with a color scheme in mind.
        Academic program pages have a blue tint, the Ag Experiment Station
        pages have a green tint, and the Cooperative Extension Service has
        a reddish tint.  To create a common style, it would be good to
        place your pages in the same color scheme as this.
    <dt><b>Logo (Optional)</b>
    <dd>We have several colored versions of the CAHE logo for your use.
        You can either point to them on our server, or you can download
        them for your own use.  They are:

        </ul>
  </dl>
<a name="extension"><hr>
<h2>Extension-Specific Guidelines</h2></a>

  The following guidelines were taken from 'Minimum Publication Information - A Proposed
  Standard for Extension Publications in All Media,' put together by ES-4, the Working
  Group on Standard Practices for Providing Current and Long-Term Access to Educational
  Materials in All Media.  All Extension documents should contain:<p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Title
      <li>Author(s), including production unit, producers, directors, writers, programmers,
          photographers, etc.
      <li>Edition or Version
      <li>Place of publication
      <li>Name of publisher
      <li>Date of publication or copyright date
      <li>Series title and frequency
    </ul><p>
  
  Clearly, this would not apply to all Extension web pages.  These guidelines would apply
  to Extension web pages whose content is considered an Extension document.  For example,
  a 4-H activity guide would have all this information, but a page with links to several of
  these guides might not need to.  This information for a document could even be kept on a
  separate web page, if desired, as long as all the above information is available in the
  same format as the documents themselves.  (Conceivably, anyway; this is the sort of
  thing the committee should decide.)<p>

  If you don't have a direct internet connection in your office, it will take you
  considerably longer to develop your web site.  Not only is an internet connection
  much simpler than dealing with a SLIP connection (or even walking files over with
  a floppy disk), but your connection will be much faster, enabling you to view
  and update your pages more quickly as well.<p>
  
  So what's the downside?  It's expensive.<p>
  
  In order to get an internet connection in your office, Computing and Networking
  will have to run a cable from a router cabinet in your building through the
  walls and into your office, and build a plug into the wall in your office.  Then
  they will hook up your machine to the plug, possibly requiring a card for your
  computer.  Finally, they will allocate you a port out of the cabinet, and set up
  your computer with the appropriate software.  This adds up to a lot of labor and
  parts to the tune of several hundred dollars per machine.  If you are unfortunate
  enough to not have a cabinet in your building, or if the cabinet is full and a
  new one needs to be put in before they can connect you, the cost can skyrocket
  again.<p>
  
  The good news is that Computing and Networking is willing to do most of the
  legwork for you.  All you have to do is pay them.  They will give you an estimate
  if you are wary of the cost, too.<p>
  
  <b>How to do it:</b><br>
  Call the Networking department of CANTO at x64244.  Tell them that you need to
  set up a work order to have someone put internet access in your office.  (If you
  want an estimate first, tell them now.)  They will get some basic information on
  your request, like the room the connection is to go into, who the contact person
  will be, and their phone number.  They will FAX you an authorization form, which
  you will need to fill out.  It will require signatures and a fund number to
  charge.  When you FAX it back, they will get the ball rolling, and you should
  have a response within a week or so.<p>
  
  The cost varies widely from case to case.  Factors that influence the cost include
  whether or not port space is available, how hard it is to wire your building,
  and whether your computer is ethernet-ready.  CANTO charges $45/hour for labor.<p>

<h2>Where do I get Internet software for Windows?</h2></a>

  <i>(The following is taken, with permission, from a CANTO handout.  I have made
      some minor editorial changes in the sake of clarity.)</i><p>
  
  These are instructions for downloading your own self-installing disks.  These
  programs (Netscape, Trumpet Winsock, telnet, tn3270, FTP and Eudora) require
  Windows 3.1 or 3.11 to operate.  A modem with a speed of 9600 bps or better is
  required.  When you have these disks downloaded, you can take them home and
  install the programs yourself following the
  <a href="http://www.nmsu.edu/~CANTO/labdocs/net_conn.html">Installation Instructions</a>
  they provide.  (After May 20th, this link will be 
  <a href="http://www.nmsu.edu/~CandN/labdocs/net_conn.html">here</a>.)
  <p>
  
  <b>Note:</b>  To download the C&N software requires four (4) high density (1.44M)
  formatted 3.5" disks.<p>


  <b>How to do it:</b><br>  
  From one of the NMSU computer labs (CANTO, Jacobs Hall, English, Knox), log on to
  a PC using your SSN.<p>
  
  Select the 'Misc. Applications' icon.<p>
  
  From the window, select "NMSU-NET Install Kit."<p>
  
  Respond to the messages on-screen (starting with: "Insert Disk 1 into A:").  Be sure
  to label your disks!  Disk one is Network Applications 1, disk two is Network
  Applications 2, disk three is Web Browser 1, and disk four is Web Browser 2.<p>
  
  You'll see a window listing the files as they are copied; another window will show
  the percentage of total transfer completed.  The copy process takes several minutes
  per disk, about ten minutes total.<p>
  
  When the process is complete, you'll see the message "Copy was successful!"<p>
  
  Exit from the NMSU-NET Install Kit and end your session.<p>

<h2>How do I write and test my HTML web pages?</h2></a>

  The good news is that you don't need to put your pages on the Web server to see
  how they are going to look; you can develop them on your own machine, and then,
  when you've got them looking how you want them, you can move them over all at
  once.  This is especially good for people who have to connect via modem.<p>
  
  The bad news is that sometimes, when you think your page looks good, it may look
  really bad to other people who are using different browsers or window sizes than
  you are.  This means that testing your web pages is not just a matter of looking
  at it once.<p>
  
  <b>How to do it:</b><br>
  Use any word processor to write your HTML.  (For an introduction to using HTML,
  see the <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html">Beginner's
  Guide to HTML</a>.)  Save it in ASCII, or 'plain text,' format, in a directory
  on your hard drive that you know how to find.  You may want to make a new
  subdirectory called HTML to house your HTML documents.  If you are on a PC,
  name your document with an .HTM extension.  Otherwise, name it with an .html
  extension.  (Many browsers look at the extension to figure out how to display
  the document.)<p>
  
  Once your HTML document is done, launch your browser however you do it normally.
  There should be an option under the file menu to open a file.  Select that, and
  open the file you just created or changed.  (If you are accessing it via lynx,
  cd to the directory where you are keeping your HTML files, and then simply
  type 'lynx' followed by the file name you want to test.)<p>
  
  You will be looking at your HTML file as it will appear once it is put on the
  server.  You can test links, as long as you have them on your hard drive in the
  same relative place as they will be on the server (i.e., links that go to files
  that will be stored in the same directory on the server need to be in the same
  directory on your computer in order to test them).<p>
  
  If you are using a graphical browser, you should be aware that people can set
  their fonts and window size to whatever they want.  The way it appears on your
  screen is not how it will appear on other people's machines.  They could display
  thier text in 9 point proportional serif text or 24 point nonproportional sans serif,
  or whatever; they may have a full-screen window, or they may have their window
  sized to be only a quarter of the screen.  You don't know, so it's a good idea to
  play around with your browser a bit to make sure that it doesn't depend on a specific
  text size or style, or the size of the window.  Generally, it's not a problem, but
  it can be if placement of graphics or text is important.  For an example of such a
  case, <a href="snake.html">click here</a>.<p>

<h1>Environmental Science</h1>
<hr>
<h1>Are you concerned about...</h1>
<ul>
  <li>...recycling and managing waste?
  <li>...protecting and restoring the environment?
  <li>...preserving species diversity?
</ul>

<strong>You can have a career that addresses these complex issues.</strong><p>
The Department of Agronomy and Horticulture offers you a progressive program
in environmental science.<p>

<h2>Environmental Science:<br>A Multi-Disciplinary Program</h2>
Questions concerning the environment are complex, requiring a
multi-disciplinary approach to answer them. Therefore, faculty from across
NMSU have pooled their expertise and knowledge from many different disciplines
to develop a degree that prepares students for careers in environmental science.<p>

<strong><i>The foundation</i></strong> of the curriculum is a diverse and
strong basic science and computing background. This basic science curriculum
includes courses in the following areas:

<ul>
  <li>Biology
  <li>Geology
  <li>Chemistry
  <li>Physics
  <li>Geography
  <li>Civil engineering
  <li>Soil science
  <li>Math
  <li>Statistics
  <li>Computer science
</ul>

A core of environmental science courses applies science and technology
to environmental problems. During their courses, students will complete EPA
and OSHA certification requirements for accessing sites of environmental
contamination. Core courses are offered in these areas:

<ul>
  <li>Environmental science
  <li>Ground and surface water
  <li>Environmental regulations
  <li>Toxicology
  <li>Environmental sampling
  <li>Impact of land usage
  <li>Environmental response
  <li>Ecology
</ul>

<strong><i>Options.</i></strong> In addition to pursuing a multi-disciplinary
education in basic and environmental sciences, students are required to
specialize in a discipline. These four options are currently available:

<ul>
  <li>chemistry
  <li>geology
  <li>soil science
  <li>wildlife science
</ul>

<h2>Career Opportunities</h2>
Careers in environmental science are on the increase, and employment is
available in all sectors of society. Government, industry, and consulting
are the predominant employers of environmental science majors.<p>

<strong><i>In industry,</i></strong> environmental compliance is a cost of
doing business for manufacturing, mining, agriculture, and service industries.<p>

<strong><i>In government,</i></strong> the environmental scientist is involved
in enforcement, technical assistance, and training. Most careers are at the
state or local level, but federal agencies have environmental scientists at
all levels.<p>

<strong><i>Consulting companies</i></strong> handle environmental restoration
and compliance, both for the private and government sectors.<p>

Environmental science graduates also teach and work for nonprofit advocacy
and philanthropic organizations.<p>

<h2>Student Activities</h2>
Students are encouraged to participate in student organizations and clubs.
Participating in a club develops professionalism, establishes a network of
other students and professionals, broadens a studentÕs perspective, and helps
professors and employers evaluate a student as a person.<p>

A variety of academic, professional, and social clubs are available in the
<a href="http://taipan.nmsu.edu/aght/agronomy.html">Department of Agronomy
and Horticulture</a>, the
<a href="../Welcome.html">College of Agriculture and Home Economics</a>, and
other colleges across campus. Joining organizations from different colleges
will enhance a student's multi-disciplinary education.<p>

administration, accounting, marketing, management, consumer science, and
other disciplines. NMSUÕs unique location allows market studies in major
fashion centers such as the California Apparel Mart in Los Angeles, the
Apparel Mart in Dallas, and the Merchandise Mart in Denver.<p>

<h3>Family, Child, and Consumer Sciences (FCCS)</h3>
FCCS is a professional area that focuses on the family as a system of
interacting persons and as consumers. The underlying assumption of this
profession is that the family is the most basic unit in society. The
more effective the family in meeting the needs and goals of its members,
the more society benefits from content, well-adapted, productive citizens.<p>

<i>FCCS options:</i> consumer science, human development, and family studies.<p>

<h3>Home Economics Education (HEED)</h3>
HEED graduates teach in junior and senior high schools, community colleges,
and the extension service, as well as promote and manage businesses. Home
economics teachers help others learn about child and family development,
fashion and clothing, interior design and housing, food science and nutrition,
consumer education, and resource management. Graduates will be prepared for
a New Mexico teaching license.<p>

<h3>Human Nutrition and Food Science (HNFS)</h3>
Graduates from this program are prepared for professions on the cutting edge
of human nutrition and food science. In addition to courses within the major,
HNFS students take chemistry and biology to prepare for nutrition and food
science courses. Graduates can find careers in clinical, administrative, and
community dietetics; sports nutrition; and food product development, testing,
marketing, and sales.<p>
<i>HNFS options:</i> dietetics, and food science and nutrition.<p>

In addition to taking classes, students have opportunities for practical
experiences through field placements and research.<p>

<h2>Career Opportunities</h2>
Home economics fields are often called 'people professions,' as their
mission is to improve the lives of families and individuals. Students
graduate with skills appropriate for careers that serve society directly,
and they also gain insight into personal issues that confront us all in
daily living.<p>

Home economics graduates not only prepare for professional careers, but
they also learn how to improve the quality of their own lives. Course content

<h1>Hospitality and Tourism Services</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Bachelor's Degree Program</h2>

Concentrations in:
<ul>
  <li>Food and Beverage Operations
  <li>Tourism Services
  <li>Hotel/Resort Services
  <li>Convention, Meeting
  <li>Special Event Administration
</ul>

The Hospitality and Tourism Services (HTS) program in the
<a href="../Welcome.html">College of Agriculture and Home Economics</a> at
<a href="http://www.nmsu.edu/">New Mexico State University</a> is designed
to prepare students for the fastest growing industry in the United States
today.<p>

AmericaÕs hotels, convention centers, private clubs and restaurants open
their doors to millions of people and billions of dollars each year. The
industry ranks second in annual sales nationally, and employs more people
than any other.<p>

Hospitality is now the employer ranked number one within the American work
force, and is expected to be the fastest growing employment sector for both
hourly and managerial positions well into the 21st century. Projections for
future service sales within the industry are in the hundreds of billions.<p>

Currently, over ten million people are employed by the food service industry
sector of hospitality alone. Projections show that by the year 2000, one of
every 9 employees in the United States will be working in the hospitality
industry.<p>

Forecasters are also predicting that by the beginning of the 21st century,
the food service industry will be the largest industry in the nation,
surpassing agriculture which is currently number one. Since projections are
calling for a 32-hour work week by the year 2000, there will be more leisure
time and disposable income for increased domestic and international travel.<p>
 
Employees in the hospitality industry can move into middle management
positions faster than in many other fields because of the industryÕs rapid
growth. Ambitious and motivated college graduates can reach very high salary
ranges in three to five years in many hospitality and tourism firms.
Students who are ready for fast-lane opportunities should consider careers
in travel, recreation, food service, lodging, restaurant management and many
other areas in the hospitality industry.<p>

<h1>Financial Aid</h1>
<hr>
There's a price on quality education, but paying the price doesn't have to
put a hole in the pocketbook.

The College of Agriculture and Home Economics has more than $100,000 available
in scholarships every year, giving majors in the College an excellent chance
for scholarship support at NMSU. Many of these scholarships are endowed, which
means the scholarships are available every year. Several are continuing
scholarships and the recipient can continue to receive it each year that
scholarship requirements are met.<p>

The College has almost 100 different scholarships available, some providing
funds to two or three qualifying students in the same year. More than
one-third of the scholarships are available to freshman students. Some are
based on academic performance, some on financial need, and some on a combination
of both.<p>

Despite this diversity and flexibility, all scholarships have one thing in
common: an early application deadline. All scholarship applications for fall
semester must be submitted before March first.<p>

For more information on College-based financial aid, contact
<a href="liesner.html">Mary Liesner</a> in the Academic Programs office.  For
University-based aid, <a href="#moreoptions">see below</a>.<p>

  <li>...protecting and restoring the environment?
  <li>...preserving species diversity?
</ul>

<strong>You can have a career that addresses these complex issues.</strong><p>
The Department of Agronomy and Horticulture offers you a progressive program
in environmental science.<p>

<h2>Environmental Science:<br>A Multi-Disciplinary Program</h2>
Questions concerning the environment are complex, requiring a
multi-disciplinary approach to answer them. Therefore, faculty from across
NMSU have pooled their expertise and knowledge from many different disciplines
to develop a degree that prepares students for careers in environmental science.<p>

<strong><i>The foundation</i></strong> of the curriculum is a diverse and
strong basic science and computing background. This basic science curriculum
includes courses in the following areas:

<ul>
  <li>Biology
  <li>Geology
  <li>Chemistry
  <li>Physics
  <li>Geography
  <li>Civil engineering
  <li>Soil science
  <li>Math
  <li>Statistics
  <li>Computer science
</ul>

A core of environmental science courses applies science and technology
to environmental problems. During their courses, students will complete EPA
and OSHA certification requirements for accessing sites of environmental
contamination. Core courses are offered in these areas:

<ul>
  <li>Environmental science
  <li>Ground and surface water
  <li>Environmental regulations
  <li>Toxicology
  <li>Environmental sampling
  <li>Impact of land usage
  <li>Environmental response
  <li>Ecology
</ul>

<strong><i>Options.</i></strong> In addition to pursuing a multi-disciplinary
education in basic and environmental sciences, students are required to
specialize in a discipline. These four options are currently available:

<ul>
  <li>chemistry
  <li>geology
  <li>soil science
  <li>wildlife science
</ul>

<h2>Career Opportunities</h2>
Careers in environmental science are on the increase, and employment is
available in all sectors of society. Government, industry, and consulting
are the predominant employers of environmental science majors.<p>

<strong><i>In industry,</i></strong> environmental compliance is a cost of
doing business for manufacturing, mining, agriculture, and service industries.<p>

<strong><i>In government,</i></strong> the environmental scientist is involved
in enforcement, technical assistance, and training. Most careers are at the
state or local level, but federal agencies have environmental scientists at
all levels.<p>

<strong><i>Consulting companies</i></strong> handle environmental restoration
and compliance, both for the private and government sectors.<p>

Environmental science graduates also teach and work for nonprofit advocacy
and philanthropic organizations.<p>

<h2>Student Activities</h2>
Students are encouraged to participate in student organizations and clubs.
Participating in a club develops professionalism, establishes a network of
other students and professionals, broadens a studentÕs perspective, and helps
professors and employers evaluate a student as a person.<p>

A variety of academic, professional, and social clubs are available in the
<a href="http://taipan.nmsu.edu/aght/agronomy.html">Department of Agronomy
and Horticulture</a>, the
<a href="../Welcome.html">College of Agriculture and Home Economics</a>, and
other colleges across campus. Joining organizations from different colleges
will enhance a student's multi-disciplinary education.<p>

HEED graduates teach in junior and senior high schools, community colleges,
and the extension service, as well as promote and manage businesses. Home
economics teachers help others learn about child and family development,
fashion and clothing, interior design and housing, food science and nutrition,
consumer education, and resource management. Graduates will be prepared for
a New Mexico teaching license.<p>

<h3>Human Nutrition and Food Science (HNFS)</h3>
Graduates from this program are prepared for professions on the cutting edge
of human nutrition and food science. In addition to courses within the major,
HNFS students take chemistry and biology to prepare for nutrition and food
science courses. Graduates can find careers in clinical, administrative, and
community dietetics; sports nutrition; and food product development, testing,
marketing, and sales.<p>
<i>HNFS options:</i> dietetics, and food science and nutrition.<p>

In addition to taking classes, students have opportunities for practical
experiences through field placements and research.<p>

<h2>Career Opportunities</h2>
Home economics fields are often called 'people professions,' as their
mission is to improve the lives of families and individuals. Students
graduate with skills appropriate for careers that serve society directly,
and they also gain insight into personal issues that confront us all in
daily living.<p>

Home economics graduates not only prepare for professional careers, but

<h1>Hospitality and Tourism Services</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Bachelor's Degree Program</h2>

Concentrations in:
<ul>
  <li>Food and Beverage Operations
  <li>Tourism Services
  <li>Hotel/Resort Services
  <li>Convention, Meeting
  <li>Special Event Administration
</ul>

The Hospitality and Tourism Services (HTS) program in the
<a href="../Welcome.html">College of Agriculture and Home Economics</a> at
<a href="http://www.nmsu.edu/">New Mexico State University</a> is designed
to prepare students for the fastest growing industry in the United States
today.<p>

AmericaÕs hotels, convention centers, private clubs and restaurants open
their doors to millions of people and billions of dollars each year. The
industry ranks second in annual sales nationally, and employs more people
than any other.<p>

Hospitality is now the employer ranked number one within the American work
force, and is expected to be the fastest growing employment sector for both
hourly and managerial positions well into the 21st century. Projections for
future service sales within the industry are in the hundreds of billions.<p>

Currently, over ten million people are employed by the food service industry
sector of hospitality alone. Projections show that by the year 2000, one of
every 9 employees in the United States will be working in the hospitality
industry.<p>

Forecasters are also predicting that by the beginning of the 21st century,
the food service industry will be the largest industry in the nation,
surpassing agriculture which is currently number one. Since projections are
calling for a 32-hour work week by the year 2000, there will be more leisure
time and disposable income for increased domestic and international travel.<p>
 
Employees in the hospitality industry can move into middle management
positions faster than in many other fields because of the industryÕs rapid
growth. Ambitious and motivated college graduates can reach very high salary
ranges in three to five years in many hospitality and tourism firms.
Students who are ready for fast-lane opportunities should consider careers
in travel, recreation, food service, lodging, restaurant management and many
other areas in the hospitality industry.<p>

scholarships and the recipient can continue to receive it each year that
scholarship requirements are met.<p>

The College has almost 100 different scholarships available, some providing
funds to two or three qualifying students in the same year. More than
one-third of the scholarships are available to freshman students. Some are
based on academic performance, some on financial need, and some on a combination
of both.<p>

Despite this diversity and flexibility, all scholarships have one thing in
common: an early application deadline. All scholarship applications for fall
semester must be submitted before March first.<p>

<h1>College Ambassadors<hr></h1>

  The College Ambassador program began in 1988 as a leadership opportunity for selected students
to represent and promote the programs and activities of the <a href="../../Welcome.html">
College of Agriculture and Home Economics</a>.  Ambassadors of the College of Agriculture promote
the College and assist in student recruitment.  Specific responsibilities consistent with
educational training, individual interests, competencies, and the needs of the College are
assigned to the ambassadors.  College Ambassadors:

<ul>
  <li>Recruit prospective students through activities such as making phone calls, giving campus
      and College tours, visiting high schools, county fairs, and other special events, and
      representing the College for Spring Visitors Day and new student programs;
  <li>Promote interdepartmental communications among students and faculty;
  <li>Serve as public speakers to university and community groups, classes, special events;
  <li>Represent the College at various receptions, activities, and functions;
  <li>And in general act as spokespersons for the students, the departments, the
      College, and the University.
</ul>

  Being a College Ambassador is a priveledge that requires enthusiasm, commitment, knowledge,
and a belief in the value and work of the College.  Ambassadors must be competent and
comfortable in a variety of settings, demonstrate diverse presentation skills, and exhibit
an interest and understanding of people.<p>
