<P>Editorial:
<P><B>The war on drugs
<P>Prohibition isn't working
<BR>some legalisation will help.</B>

<P><DD>Drugs, says psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, have taken over the lead role from sex in the "the grand morality play of human existence.&nbsp;  "No longer, says Szasz, "are men, women, and children tempted, corrupted, and ruined by the irresistibly sweet pleasures of sex; instead, they are tempted, corrupted, and ruined by the irresistibly sweet pleasures of drugs."<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#1">1</A></SMALL></SUP>&nbsp;   Because dealing with drugs is viewed as a moral problem, politicians tend to compete in their zeal to banish the evil from the kingdom.&nbsp;  Those who talk of legalisation are dismissed as mavericks, and whipped back into line.  The British government's drug strategy for the next three years states baldly "There will be no legalisation of any currently controlled drugs."<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#2">2</A></SMALL></SUP>&nbsp;  But some legalisation would help.
<DD>The politicians fighting the jihad against drugs want to obliterate the enemy.&nbsp;  They, of course, make an exception for legal drugs like alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine; indeed, British government last week recommended tee totallers take up drinking alcohol for the good of their health.<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#3">3</A></SMALL></SUP>&nbsp;  Yet a world devoid of drugs seems as unlikely as a world devoid of poverty and sin.&nbsp;  Thomas Sydenham observed 300 years ago "Among the remedies which it has pleased Almighty God to give to man to relieve his sufferings, none is so universal and so efficacious as opium"<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#4">4</A></SMALL></SUP>; and Aldous Huxley wrote "That humanity at large will ever be able to dispense Artificial Paradises seems very unlikely.&nbsp;  Most men women lead lives at the worst so painful, at the best monotonous, poor and limited that the urge to escape longing to transcend themselves if only for a few moments, is and has always been one of the principal appetites of the soul."<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#5">5</A></SMALL></SUP>
<DD>If we accept that a world without drugs is unachievable (and probably intolerable) then the important question, argues drug policy expert Ethan Nadelmann, becomes "What are the best means to regulate the production, distribution and consumption of the great variety of psychoactive substances available today and in the foreseeable future?"<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#6">6</A></SMALL></SUP>&nbsp;  To reduce the debate to arguments between "prohibitionists" and "legalisers" is to oversimplify, but it's a useful device for beginning to understand the issues.&nbsp;  The case for legalising drugs begins with the failure of current prohibitionist policies.&nbsp;  The United States has been conducting a "war on drugs" for seven decades, during which time there have been steady increases in seizures of illegal drugs, the numbers of people using drugs, and the health and social costs of drug taking.&nbsp;  Economists argue from first principles that the war on drugs must fail.&nbsp;  Any success in reducing the supply will raise the price of illegal drugs.&nbsp;  Addicts must then commit more crime to feed their habit; and a rise in the profit margins of drug smugglers urges them on to greater efforts.
<DD>The history of the drug trade is that supply always meets demand.&nbsp;  Milton Friedman, the Nobel prize winning economist, puts it thus: "Illegality creates obscene profits that finance the murderous tactics of the drug lords; illegality leads to the corruption of law enforcement officials; illegality monopolises the efforts of honest law forces so that they are starved of resources to fight the simpler crimes of robbery, theft and assault."<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#7">7</A></SMALL></SUP>&nbsp;  The main result of the United States war on drugs is a prison system bursting with petty drug offenders, most of them African-Americans.
<DD>Britain has never been as warlike as the United States in efforts to control drugs.&nbsp;  British policy is, however, essentially prohibitionist, and yet about seven million people in Britain have taken cannabis at some time in their lives.<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#8">8</A></SMALL></SUP>&nbsp;  About a quarter to a third of young people have tried solvents or illegal drugs by their 20th  birthday<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#9">9</A></SMALL></SUP>, and in one survey the proportion of young people who had been offered drugs rose from 2% in 1969 to 41% in 1994.<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#9">9</A></SMALL></SUP>&nbsp;  LSD and ecstasy have now also been absorbed into mainstream youth culture, with about 9% of those aged 16 to l9 having used ecstasy and about 8% LSD.<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#9">9</A></SMALL></SUP>&nbsp;  These high reported prevalences are likely to be true because seizures of cannabis more than tripled from 23,592 in 1984 to 107,629 in 1994, ecstasy seizures increased from 39 in 1989 to 715 in 1994, and heroin seizures rose from 2,995 in 1984 to 4,480 in 1994.<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#10">10</A></SMALL></SUP>

<P><B>Time to consider going Dutch?</B>
<DD>Other countries have been more willing to experiment with decriminalisation and legalization.&nbsp;  The Netherlands effectively decriminalised penal possession of drugs in 1976, and cannabis is sold in "coffee shops."&nbsp;  The Dutch are now coming under great pressure to reverse their experiment from neighbouring countries, worried that they are being flooded with drugs from the Netherlands.&nbsp;  Yet the 1976 changes in the Netherlands seem to have been followed by a fall in use of cannabis: from 13 % of those aged 17-18 in 1976 to 6% in 1985.&nbsp;  Monthly prevalence of cannabis use among Dutch high school students is around 5.4% compared with 29% in the United States.<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#11">11</A></SMALL></SUP>&nbsp;  Forbidden fruit may, indeed, be sweetest.
<DD>One simple argument for criminalising drugs is often used  by governments in the context of tobacco: that the state has no right to interfere with what individuals do in private so long as they don't harm others.&nbsp;  Another argument is that legalisation would cut the huge costs of enforcement, prosecution, and imprisonment.&nbsp;  Thirdly, a legal market could allow quality control of drugs and education on how to avoid them or use them more safely; drugs might more predictably be prevented from reaching the young and vulnerable.&nbsp;  Finally, many of the adverse health effects of drugs stem from criminalisation rather than from the drugs themselves.&nbsp;  Anyway, current policy is clearly not driven by totting up the good and bad effects of drugs: few are more harmful than tobacco.
<DD>Although the arguments for legalisation can be expressed forcefully, almost nobody argues for a free, legal, unregulated market for all drugs, and clearly no single policy will cover all drugs.&nbsp;  Nadelmann says: "It is imperative that any drug policy distinguishes between casual use that results in little or no harm to anyone, drug misuse that causes harm primarily to the consumer, and drug misuse that results in palpable harm to others - and then focuses primarily on the last of these, secondarily on preventing the misuse of drugs, and little at all on casual drug use."<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#6">6</A></SMALL></SUP>
<DD>The key question is how the world would look if drugs were legal.&nbsp;  The Australian National Task Force on Cannabis has identified five options for cannabis legislation: total prohibition; prohibition with civil penalties; partial prohibition; regulation of the production, distribution, and sale of cannabis; and free availability.<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#12">12</A></SMALL></SUP>&nbsp;  The task force opted for keeping possession, cultivation, and sale in any quantity illegal but decriminalising "simple personal use or possession ... without compromising activities aimed at deterring cannabis use."&nbsp;  Others - for instance, economist Richard Stevenson have tried to describe a world where large companies produce, distribute, and advertise drugs like heroin and cocaine and invest heavily in research designed to produce drugs that will satisfy customers' wants while making them safer.<SUP><SMALL><A HREF="#13">13</A></SMALL></SUP>&nbsp;  Much more work needs to be done on envisaging a world that includes some legalisation of drugs.&nbsp;  But it's clear that purely prohibitionist policies don't work and make the problems of drug abuse worse.
<DD>Governments worldwide have followed illogical and often counterproductive drug policies, primarily because drug use is seen in moral terms.&nbsp;  Wars on drugs are doomed to failure, but experiments with decriminalising and even legalising drugs - as in the Netherlands - have shown promising results.&nbsp;  Policies that allow some decriminalisation and legalisation are much more likely than prohibition to succeed in achieving everybody's aim of minimising the harm from drug abuse.

<CENTER><STRONG><FONT SIZE=6>WASHINGTON STATE SENATE</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>For Immediate Release - March 8, 1996</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>Funding for study on medical marijuana in budget</FONT></STRONG></CENTER><H3>
<P>     OLYMPIA: Washington State University and the state Department of Health will start looking for ways to make medicinal marijuana available to the seriously ill, under strict controls, through an appropriation provided in this year's operating budget.
<P>     The psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has been shown to ease the adverse effects of chemotherapy, and the symptoms of glaucoma, AIDS, and other life-threatening illnesses.  But the synthetic drugs containing THC currently available for medical use may not provide effective relief to all patients in need.
<P>     The funding for the study came through the efforts of state Senators Jeanne Kohl, D-Seattle and Bob McCaslin, R-Spokane.  The two senators co-sponsored a bill (SB-6744) that would have provided funding for two studies on medicinal marijuana.  That bill was used as a model for the appropriation provided in this year's budget.
<P>     The funds will be used by Washington State University, in conjunction with the state Board of Pharmacy, and the state Department of Health to conduct research on cultivating marijuana in a tamper-free environment.  The study will also determine the appropriate organization to manufacture and distribute the drug for medical use.
<P>     Another appropriation will be used to fund a clinical study administered by the state Department of Health under the controlled substances abuse therapeutic program, in statute since 1979.
<P>     The study will be limited to patients under a physician's care.  Only patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation treatments, or suffering from glaucoma, AIDS or HIV-related illnesses, multiple sclerosis, or other life threatening illnesses would qualify for the study.  Patients will be informed of the experimental nature of the program, and the risk and side effects of the treatment.
<P>     Preliminary results of a statewide poll conducted by EvansMcDonough the weekend of March 2nd-3rd indicates a public willing to allow marijuana to be used for strictly medicinal purposes.  The statewide survey of 400 voters found that 78 percent favored making marijuana available for patients if prescribed by a doctor.
<P>     Sharon Gilpin, who worked with EvansMcDonough in conducting the survey, said the results were a complete surprise.  "I know the people in the Northwest tend to be compassionate, but the high number was totally unexpected," she said.  Gilpin said people who are concerned about the rising cost of health care are willing to look at alternatives to the high cost of fighting diseases such as AIDS and cancer.
<P>     "This is a great start that will lead to what we hope is a promising finish," said Dr. David Edwards, an Olympia physician and medical coordinator for the Washington Hemp Education Network, an agency working on informing the public on the potential benefits of medicinal marijuana.  "I expect the results to have a positive effect in our effort to provide organic marijuana to patients under strict medical guidelines."
<P>     Joanna McKee, who works with AIDS patients and who has used marijuana under a physician's care to ease chronic pain of a serious spinal injury, said she is confident the study will confirm what other tests have shown: the positive effects of medicinal marijuana.  "The medical community is so focused on using chemicals to combat illness, they ignore a simple, organic solution that's readily available," she said.  "This test will provide the answer to those who still question the effectiveness of THC."
<P>     Sen. McCaslin said if the results of the state study on THC is similar to others conducted, organic marijuana could be a boon for the seriously ill.  "It will not only aid them in their physical recovery, it could prove to be a psychological boost as well," he said.  The Spokane Republican said getting physical relief from their pain will help many patients keep a positive attitude.  "It will help them look ahead to a brighter future," he said.
<P>     Kohl said the study is the first step towards getting needed medicine to those who desperately need it.  "If the synthetic drug is not working for a patient, it only makes sense they should be able to have access to organic marijuana."  The Seattle Democrat said the studies will not legalize marijuana, nor the use of marijuana for medical purposes.  "But if THC does help the seriously ill, we should find a sensible and legal way to cultivate and distribute it to those in need."
<P>     Sen. Kohl and Sen. McCaslin both applauded the assistance of Sen. Nita Rinehart, D-Seattle and Rep. Tom Huff, R-Gig Harbor for their efforts in getting the funding for the study included in the budget.

<p><tt>Cannabidiol: The Wonder Drug of the 21st Century?</tt></p>

<p><tt>The traditional use of Cannabis as an analgesic,
anti-asthmatic, and anti-rheumatic drug is well established. This
British study also suggests that cultivation of Cannabis plants
rich in Cannabidiol (CBD) and other phenolic substances would be
useful not only as fiber producing plants but also for medicinal
purposes in the treatment of certain inflammatory disorders. CBD
was found to be more effective than aspirin as an anti-inflammatory
agent. &quot;Analgesic and Anti-inflammatory Activity of Constituents
of Cannabis Sativa L.,&quot; E.A. Formukong, A.T. Evans, and F.J. Evans,
Inflammation, Vol. 4, 1988, pp. 361-371.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Cannabidiol, CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid of
Marijuana, was given to 5 patients with dystonia disorders.
Improvement occurred in all 5 patients by 20-50%. &quot;Open
Label Evaluation of Cannabidiol in Dystonic Movement
Disorders,&quot; Consroe, et al, International Journal of Neuroscience,
1986, Vol. 30, pp.277-282.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Three patients with Huntington's Disease who had been
previously unresponsive to therapy with neuroleptics, were given
Cannabidiol, (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid of Marijuana.
After the second week improvement in choreic movement occurred by
20-40%. Except for transient, mild hypo-tension no side effects
were recorded.&quot;Effects of Cannabidiol in Huntington's
Disease,&quot; Sandyk, Consroe, Stern, and Snider, Neurology, 36
(Suppl. 1) April, 1986, p.342.</tt></p>

<p><tt>In this Brazilian study of 8 Epileptic patients receiving
Cannabidiol, (CBD), 4 were free of convulsions, 3 had partial
improvement, and 1 was unchanged. No serious side effects were
found. This is quite important, as complex partial seizures with
secondary generalization are difficult to treat with currently
used drugs. The potential use of CBD as an anti-epileptic drug
and its possible potentiating effect on other drugs are
discussed. &quot;Chronic Administration of Cannabidiol to Healthy Volunteers
and Epileptic Patients,&quot; Pharmacology, 21: 1980, J.M. Cunha, et
al, pp.175-185.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Subjects receiving 160 mg. Cannabidiol reported having
slept significantly more than those receiving placebo; seven out
of eight epileptics receiving Cannabidiol had improvement of
their disease state. (Brazil) &quot;Hypnotic and Antiepileptic
Effects of Cannabidiol,&quot; Carlini, E.A., and Cunha, J.A.,
Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 1981: 21: pp. 417S-427S.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Three patients with TS who experienced incomplete
responses to conventional anti-TS drugs but noted a significant
amelioration of symptoms when smoking marijuana. The effects of
marijuana on TS may be related to its anxiety-reducing
properties, although a more specific antidyskinetic effect cannot
be excluded. Eliminating the psychoactive properties of marijuana
while retaining the antidyskinetic effects (Cannabidiol) could
prove beneficial. &quot;Marijuana and Tourette's Syndrome,&quot;
(letter), Sandyk and Awerbuch, Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology,
Vol. 8, No. 6, Dec. 1988, pp.444-5.</tt></p>

L.H., Johannesen, J., Musty, R.E., Consroe, P., Proceedings of
the International Congress on Marijuana. 1987: 21. Melbourne,

<p><tt>This Brazilian study Investigates the possible
anti-psychotic activity of CBD by studying the effect of this
cannabinoid on animal models used in research with potential
anti-psychotic properties. CBD seems to compare favorably with
haloperidol as an anti-psychotic. &quot;Effects of CBD in animal
models predictive of anti-psychotic activity,&quot; Zuardi, A.W., Rodrigues,
J.A., Cunha, J.M., Psychopharmacology 1991: 104: pp. 260-264.</tt></p>

potentiates some other effects. (Brazil)&quot;Pharmacological
Interaction between Cannabidiol and Tetrahydrocannabinol,&quot;
Karniol, I.G., Carlini, E.A., Psychopharmacologia 1973: 33: pp.
53-70.</tt></p>

<p><tt>CBD was effective in blocking most of the effects of THC,
increased pulse rate, disturbed time tasks, and psychological
reactions. CBD also decreased the anxiety components of THC.
(Brazil) &quot;Cannabidiol Interferes with the effects of
Tetrahydrocannabinol in Man,&quot; Karniol, I.G., Shirakawa, I.,
Kasinski, N., Pfeferman, A., Carlini, E.A., European Journal of
Pharmacology 1974: 28: pp. 172-177.</tt></p>

<p><tt>One of the first studies that clearly shows that hemp
grown for fiber is very low in THC, the psychoactive component
that gets people high. The drug-type marijuana is very high in
THC. Cannabidiol (CBD) which is not psychoactive, is very high in
fiber-type hemp but low in drug-type marijuana. This is important
as CBD is known to block the effects of THC. This makes the hemp
doubly useless for drug effects. &quot;Chemistry of Marijuana,&quot;
Coy Waller. Pharmacological Reviews, Vol. 23, No. 4, 1971.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Wild 'marijuana' growing in Riley County Kansas was found
to be very low in THC content. (Below the European threshold for
fiber hemp.) The leaves and flowering tops averaged from
0.01-0.49% THC with a mean of 0.14% THC. CBD which blocks the
psychoactive effects of THC was as high as 1.7%. &quot;Seasonal
Fluctuations in Cannabinoid Content of Kansas Marijuana,&quot;
R.P. Latta, and B.J. Eaton. Economic Botany, 29: April-June,
1975, pp. 153-163.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Researchers for the Canadian Department of Agriculture
tested over 350 varieties of Cannabis in Ottawa, Ontario. They
determined that there were two basic types of Cannabis based on
genetic characteristics: a drug-type which originates in hot
climates such as India and is high in THC but low in CBD and a
fiber-type which originates in temperate climates and is low in
THC but high in CBD and is used industrially for fiber and food.
This awareness of the separateness of the two phenotypes has vast
agronomic potential. It means fiber hemp can be grown without the
drug effect of 'marijuana.' &quot;The Evolution of Cannabinoid
Phenotypes in Cannabis,&quot; Ernest Small, H.D. Beckstead, and
Allan Chan, Economic Botany, 29: 1975, pp. 219-232.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Ten mg. of THC is required to get a psychoactive effect
from 'marijuana.' It would require 50-100 cigarettes of the
French hemp cultivated for paper to get a psychoactive high.

<PRE>HISTORY OF THE ETHIOPIAN ZION COPTIC CHURCH 
 
By Walter Wells, Spiritual Leader, Servant of Goud 
 
     "When the strong oppress the weak, and men sell, or condone the 
selling of, their brother's liberty, to achieve fading gold  SLAVERY, 
OPPRESSlON, HATRED and CRlME, will be the order of the day.  Man must 
examine his conscience to see if what he pours out, is what he would 
readily receive" -- The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. 
 
     It has been said by modern historians, that the scarcity of written 
records has enshrouded the history of Africa in mystery and ignorance: 
this is not so.  The first recorded history is man, and so history could 
not be that written piece of paper, but the experience of an individual 
or people written on the tablets of man's heart.  The history therefore 
of any Nation belongs only to its people, and so the history of we 
Ethiopians has been told from generation to generation even until this 
day. 
 
     It is for this reason that, although the forces of evil conspire 
against us, we of the Coptic Faith know that the leopard cannot change 
its spots, neither can we alter the commandments and precepts handed down 
by our fathers; from generation to generation, as a guiding light to 
lighten all Nations, even the Gentiles, and for the glorification of his 
people Israel. 
 
THE COPTIC DEITY. 
 
     The Deity of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church may be unknown to the 
billions of Gentiles scattered over the earth, with the exception of the 
faithful few who are fighting bravely to guide their Nation's life.  
However it is not new to the millions of blackman scattered over the 
earth like sand on the sea shore, even those in America and elsewhere.  
It is an inward spirit that once guided Israel along the troubled waters 
of the past; which he lost because of his disobedience to his teacher and 
creator, and received the punishment of slavery as a curse; under seven 
different world powers starting with Egypt, to the British American world 
power of today. 
 
     Punishment by slavery, because blackman had in ages before, and even 
today, stooped as a scum upon the earth, inferior to the entire race of 
human beings, and has sold his brother into slavery to be used and 
tormented by his enemies as a mockery upon our creative heritage that 
even today, had not their been a righteous branch among us, we also would 
be like Sodom and Gommorrah.  This dastardly act was contrary to Goud's 
declaration of individual freedom for every man on earth.  Slavery among 
Israel came about because we failed to respect each other and in time we 
became covetous and rebellious against each other.  There was no 
brotherly louv or trust among brethren of the different tribes and so the 
strong preyed upon the weak, and sold his own brother into slavery  for 
the sake of money (caesar), which Europeans taught us was the savior from 
our miseries.  Before this, when we walked in obedience to Goud, we were 
taught to keep the commandments and walk in christian principles.  
Charity, justice, equality, manliness and respect were also taught. 
 
     That spirit of unity, that existed in Israel before they 
transgressed and were placed into captivity, is still burning and will 
one day ignite into an eternal flame of desire; the desire to free 
themselves once and for all from the political slavery brought upon them 
through their own foolish imaginations, which caused them to be 
disobedient to Goud.  The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is now in the 
process of igniting this flame, and very soon we will see billions of 
blackman worldwide and the strangers within their gates  uniting and 
giving acclaim to RASTAFARI, KING, CREATOR; who with blessings has 
returned to reign, reign over HIS PEOPLE; - ISRAEL. 
 
HISTORY OF A PEOPLE. 
 
From Egypt to Rome. 
 
     The history of Israel's suffering under slavery during the time of 
the first six world powers, Egypt, Assyria, Great Babylon, Meda-Persia, 
Greece and Rome, is well recorded in the Holy Bible, the guidebook of 
every Nation to resurrect the spirit of moral consciousness, for a moral 
and spiritual rearmament - man in relationship with his Creator. 
 
     What is unknown to the millions who have been lost in vanity fair, 
including the millions of blackman around the world, whose heritage and 
dynasty the Coptic Church now declare, is THE HISTORY OF THE BLACKMAN 
TODAY, FROM THE PERIOD OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.  Let us now continue the 
history of their sufferings, from the latter part of the Roman Empire 
until today, the day upon which you read this epistle. 
 
From Rome to the British American world power. 
 
     During the latter days of the Roman Empire, the church of Rome, or 
the Catholic Church as we know it today, was the only recognized church 
worldwide.  lt. was not until the period of revolution both in England 
and on the continent, that the church of England, or Anglican church, was 
formed, then the Quakers, etc.  The Pope of Rome, who was the head of the 
church, was regarded as the most powerful man in the earth, and received 
obeisance from kings, princes, cardinals, bishops, abbots and priests. 
 
     There were many Nations which were oppressed by the Roman Empire 
such as Britain, Spain, Portugal and France.  All the great trades were 
carried out by the merchants of Venice.  As a result, other Nations made 
their own routes of trade by sailing along the coasts of Africa.  The 
first to make contact with the natives were the Portuguese during the 
sixteenth century.  They bought blackman as slaves from the Arabs who had 
earlier bought them from our own black brothers who had grown to be 
covetous and rebellious to Goud, as shown earlier in this article. (See 
Coptic Deity,  2) 
 
Blackman Deceived. 
 
     In the sixteenth century when the Portuguese and Spanish adventurers 
and oppressors started commerce on the continent of Africa, America and 
the Far East, they were accompanied by the Roman Catholic Church, who 
under the disguise of missionary priests were used as the agents of pagan 
religion to spread propaganda and subvert the Goud given Culture and 
beliefs of the people who they found living in the lands wherein they 
traded and settled.  Because we warred among each other, we were 
classified as barbarians, wild animals who needed to be civilised. 
 
     Their first deception would be to use their gifts of enchantments to 
capture the moral spirit of the people.  When they had won the 
hospitality of the people, they would indoctrinate them with their pagan 
Roman religion of a sky god called Geysus, hoping they could persuade the 
natives to give their praise and anthem to their Pope in Rome.  This they 
did under the pretense of civilisation. 
 
     So flourishing and financially successful was the selling of 
blackman into slavery, that wars broke out among the traders for 
supremacy and full control of the trade.  Britain finally won supremacy 
in the eighteenth century. 
 
PUNISHMENT UNDER THE LAST PLAGUE. 
 
The seventh and last plague; British/American world power. 
 
     The history of every country today gives a clear picture of the 
early stages of slavery under the British American world power.  History 
shows that of over twenty to twenty-four million Blackman enslaved from 
Africa only fifteen to twenty million survived the horrors meted out to 
them during their trips to the Americas.  The Coptic Church today holds 
the British Imperial government responsible for the blood of over four to 
nine million Black Israel massacred under a bandulu government during the 
period of the slave trade. 
 
     Our suffering, even to the period of emancipation in 1838, is well 
known and would not be wise to deal with in detail.  Let me bring you 
closer, however, to the present situation, as it affects us today; and so 
I start with the period 1765.  This was the period Brother Editor, when 
you the suffering people of America, pressured by your colonial masters 
to the point of extinction, placed your shoulders to the wheel in a 
united effort, to once and for all remove the shackles of British 
supremacy and corrupt oppressive administration on your colonies. 
 
     You stood up not because you were British subjects on British soil, 
yet because you had a moral conscience in the equality and rights of 
every man to live upon the earth as a free man; without enslavement from 
his brother.  We as a people admired your courage for the steps you took 
in those times.  However, one-hundred years after, when we, who were 
considered by your colonial masters as barbarians of an inferior race, 
could no longer bear the pressures of oppression and human destruction 
laid upon us, and having had our long years of grievances fall upon deaf 
ears, our race, under the able leadership of Paul Bogle, National Hero 
and Servant of Goud, rose to the challenge.  Yet because we were divided 
among ourselves, we failed and Bogle was executed by his oppressors. 
 
     As the years rolled on, the British world power by itself became 
weakened, as many of her colonies gained independence.  As a result, she 
had to share her power with her younger sister America.  The centre of 
power was removed from Britain and vested in a mixed worldwide 
international political organisation, the League of Nations, now called 
the United Nations, a cage of hateful and unclean, corrupt political 
birds. 
 
PUNISHMENT UNDER UNITED NATIONS WORLD POLITICS. 
 
Rise of a Prophet. 
 
     Fifty years after the execution of Bogle, and around the same time, 
when the British Empire fell and they conspired in setting up the United 
Nations, Goud rose up the Prophet Marcus Garvey in Jamaica, the 
headquarters of the slave trade in the West Indies, the now head of 
attraction and Biblical lisle of Patmos, where the head of civilisation 
is.  His message was the same as that of Bogle, only that as a son he was 
wiser and did not believe in the use of guns and bayonets.  His mission 
was as a forerunner to Louv Williams, a faithful disciple of Marcus and 
upon whose shoulder the mantle of leadership fell, so that we, both Jews 
and Gentiles, can partake of this great spiritual resurrection.  Marcus 
had started the preparation for the spiritual resurrection of the world 
at large.  However, because of the animosity and division between black 
and white, and the scar of slavery and demolition of his people, he had 
to set about to rebuild the moral conscience of black man, who is the 
most precious gem, the chosen race of Goud. 
 
     It is the same United Nations of today who fought against the Deity 
of Marcus and persecuted him, even as the American government, an agent 
of the United Nations, is today persecuting the Coptic Church.  Every 
nation fights against Herb, the Sacrifice of the Black Goud.  They claim 
they fight against it because it is a United Nations agreement.  Let the 
world know that this United Nations is only a worldwide political 
conspiracy of 1914 when the British world power failed; and when blackman 
should have been redeemed to his home land, they conspired and set up 
Politics and thus divided the black suffering masses under the bogus 
agency called the United Nations, who in its effort to keep the people 
divided, and thus weak, made their Sacrament to their Goud, the Herb, 
illegal by their illegal councils. 
 
     During the period of Marcus Garvey, a new spirit of unity had 
awakened in the people, both in Jamaica and America, as it is today 
through the teachings of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  As a result, 
the political leaders of the time conspired against him and imprisoned 
him, at the same time spreading propaganda that he was dead.  By so doing 
they were able to kill the fire kindled in the hearts of the people, by 
this great moral teacher. 
 
Early days of Tribulation. 
 
     After the imprisonment of the Prophet Marcus; the lot of the black 
masses worldwide became unbearable, as they were brutally manipulated by 
the society of the time.  So severely oppressed were they by their 
colonial masters, that even when in 1937 to 1938, when Bustamante 
declared himself as an advocate of the people, he was received and looked 
upon as the Moses who would deliver and return them to the Promised Land, 
wherein dwells Louv, Peace, Happiness and Prosperity.  The promise of 
deliverance and final peace of mind was promised through our forefather 
Abraham, and this promise still lives in the hearts of millions worldwide 
today. 
 
     When Bustamante came to Jamaica in the 1930's, he was unknown to the 
masses.  He later started business as a money lender among the poor 
masses and, by doing so, was able to win the confidence of the people.  
With the assistance of St. William Grant, one of Garvey's chief 
lieutenants, he was able to capture the hearts of the people, who thought 
and looked upon him as the Moses who would deliver them from their 
perils.  However, Bustamante was not a national figure, and so he could 
not represent the welfare of a national people.  His help to the masses 
was only an opportunity to seek power and riches for himself and to 
further divide the race against itself. 
 
     As the prophecy said, "Smite the Shepherd and the sheep will be 
scattered."  The masses who were left without any moral leader to cater 
for their welfare, adhered to the leadership of Bustamante.  Because he 
was not ordained as a priest or leader of Goud's people, Bustamante 
failed to resurrect the moral and ethical principles of the people and to 
guide them to a land of peace and safety as promised to our forefather 
Abraham, that Patriarch of old.  Instead, he could only organise the 
people into divided political forces, thus weakening their strength for 
liberating themselves  for instead of the masses on the one hand and the 
colonial masters on the other, the people were now divided among 
themselves under the disguise of POLITICS.  Trade unions were set up to 
control the people's labour; and the same oppressors were the ones who 
negotiated the wages of the suffering people, being ably supported by 
these political weaklings called Trade unions. 
 
     Soon after, the black masses lost the spirit of a moral awakening, 
kindled in their hearts by that great moral teacher, Marcus Messiah 
Garvey.  Many of his ardent followers like St. William Grant were 
captured by these political forces, who with the help of the various 
pagan religious groups, returned to the pagan religious practice of 
worshipping an imaginary sky god. 
 
THE DAWN OF A NEW MILLENNIUM. 
 
"LOUV" the first fruit of them that slept. 
 
     Since the advent of politics upon the black masses in Jamaica, we 
succumbed to the dark shadows that loomed around us; and many slept in 
darkness, having no hope of attaining liberty except on the wheels of the 
political system which was instituted by the "Buckie Massa's" of the 
time.  Yet, while many slept and became dormant in their spirit, there 
was one disciple of Marcus who was fervent in the spirit of Wisdom, 
Knowledge and Understanding, who took the mantle of Faith, Hope and 
Charity, to lighten the pathway of us, the masses, in this present 
generation, so that we could not in this time be deceived, as in the time 
of our fathers. 
 
     I speak of Louv Williams, the first fruit of us who are in darkness 
within this dispensation.  Louv Williams' charge was for the spiritual 
awakening of his people from the bonds of moral slavery, serfs and peons, 
and the inferiority complex which we of the black masses had adopted as 
our final lot in today's world. 
 
     Louv resurrected our moral values and purpose in life, placed us on 
the right path to individual salvation, as was our custom and culture 
before we were placed under the awful curse of slavery.  The final advent 
started in the late 1930's when politics was introduced upon the poor 
masses of Jamaica.  Louv Williams, who would not bow to political forces, 
first started his declaration of Rastafari's Holy Trinity (The Man, The 
Herb and The Word), the true Deity of Marcus, at Mountain View, 
Southeastern St. Andrew, Jamaica.  During this period, there were 
brethren like Count Ossie, Jah Lloyd and Bongo Blackheart (now of the 
natty dread faith) among many others attending school at Jerusalem 
schoolroom, under the distinguished tutorship of Louv Williams. 
 
     Because many who came to the knowledge were disobedient and contrary 
to sound doctrine, they later left the faith and were captured by the 
princes of the air.  They adopted a false culture as taught by Hilton and 
others who were captivated by the religious political forces of 1938.  
This false doctrine of Rastafari rose up in the 1950's with its roots in 
the western section of the corporate area of Kingston, Jamaica, and was 
formulated by the unprincipled ones in Louv Williams' Camp, who would not 
live up to the Divine principles of the Holy Bible as taught, and were 
therefore not allowed to partake in the Sacraments, as they were 
disorderly.  These, not spiritual minded, soon withered away when 
tribulations started, and so went and invented their own version of 
Rastafari, touching only their geneology, yet not the Divinity of 
PERSONAL ACCEPTANCE through the SON. 
 
     During the early days of Louv's declaration at Mountain View, we of 
the masses were unable to own any land of consequent value.  As a result, 
most of our Camp sites were on captured government lands.  We were in 
those times called squatters by our religious and political oppressors 
and society as a whole.  TODAY THE SQUATTERS ARE STILL HERE WAITING ON 
THEIR JUSTICE.  In the early part of 1960, after many attacks upon 
brethren by a wicked covetous and corrupted Poor Lice (police) force, the 
Camp was removed to August Town in the hills of St. Andrew, Jamaica.  It 
was first sited on University of the West Indies lands now subdivided 
into the land settlement called Kintyre.  The Camp was sited at Wilpit, 
across the Hope river, on a portion of land legally owned by one Mammy 
Louv, but captured and occupied for a long time by a Coptic brother named 
Son Latuce.  This brother later left the Faith, joined the security 
guard, and was stabbed to death. 
 
     During our stay at Wilpit, we were subjected to various political 
harassment, and even one present day Jamaican Minister of government, 
Keble-you-Feeble-you-Dunn, who was M.P. for the political constituency 
where the Camp was located, fought against us, saying the Camp should be 
removed seven miles from the university, as they could not take the 
Kuminas that we played.  The Camp was then moved to Hall's Delight, 
further in the hills, on lands owned by a brother named Massa Bouy 
Brooks.  Upon this spot mighty works were performed, the history of which 
will be recorded for future volumes.  It is, however, worthy to note at 
this stage that during the era of Marcus, and the early advent of Louv, 
we as black brethren did not know that the white man also would be saved 
in Goud's eternal kingdom.  This feeling came about because of their 
terrible brutalising of the race and the conflict caused by the RAPE OF 
ETHIOPIA by these WHITE EUROPEANS. 
 
     However, before he transfigured, Brother Louv prophesied the 
unification of black and white under one Holy Trinity.  We witnessed the 
fulfillment of this prophecy when, in the latter part of the 1960's, we 
saw the first white man set foot in Camp, and, being individually 
convinced of the TRUTH of the doctrine, accepted Christ as his Saviour, 
confessing his SINS, and partaking in the daily worship, equally with the 
black brethren.  Louv also prophesied that we would witness the 
resurrection of the Eternal Spirit on the third Day, meaning the third 
and eternal leadership in this final dispensation of time of the Church 
worldwide, which is today's period (THESE ARE THE GENERATION OF US THAT 
SEEK THY FACE O JESUS Selah).  In 1969, Brother Louv transfigured and 
ascended to his Brethren. 
 
Coming of the Son: A short work in Righteousness. 
 
     History records that, like in the era of Marcus, many brethren who 
were weak in the Faith, became dis-illusioned on his departure, and so 
were swallowed up by the various political elements of the world.  So it 
was also in the period after the transfiguration and ascension of Louv.  
Many brethren who were weak in the Faith, and many who did not lay his 
great spiritual teachings to heart, were early led into captivity, and 
many forgot the principles and precepts for which they once stood. 
 
     However, there were a few who still kept the zeal burning, and chief 
among them was one filled with the spirit of Grace and Truth, Humble 
Mantle of Louv in 1969 gathered together Louv's brethren, who were 
scattered abroad.  It was Brother Ivy who fully opened the doors of 
Salvation to the white inhabitants of the world within this dispensation, 
and taught black and white to unite together for one common cause (not 
for the liberation of the race only, yet), worldwide liberation from SIN 
and a return to the spirit of oneness in Jes-us our Lord and King 
Eternal, knowing that there is only one Goud for all races.  During his 
period of leadership, he prophesied the removal of the Church to the 
western section of the island.  His work was a short work in 
Righteousness, to unite mankind in one common cause.  He transfigured and 
ascended to his brethren in 1970. 
 
FINAL DAYS OF TRIBULATION. 
 
Brother "KEEP"_The shepherd of Brethren. 
 
     Those he mark for his own he keepeth them.  In 1970, Elder "Keeper 
of the Flock" Gordon took over the Mantle of leadership, thus, fulfilling 
the prophecy of Brother Louv of his resurrected Spirit in the third and 
eternal leadership of the Church worldwide as we now see it today.  It 
was during his early period of divine leadership that the Camp was 
removed from Hall's Delight in St. Andrew, Jamaica, to the Crown Land, 
Trelawny, in the western section of the island, thus, fulfilling another 
prophecy as foretold by Brother Ivy earlier.  From this new site many 
received Salvation, both Jews and Gentiles, and so the Church grew from 
strength to strength, increasing in numbers daily. 
 
     Within this period we were able to plan constructively the proper 
course on which to sail.  We were able to increase our agricultural 
production on a better planned basis, chiefly because we were on our own 
lands.  Cattle rearing was done extensively, as also poultry, etc.  Even 
upon our own lands we were subjected to political harassment; and one 
government minister even remarked that because we were teaching the 
people to be independent, he could not get anyone to work on his banana 
plantation.  During this period, we had our fields destroyed by 
government army helicopters which landed in our fields, destroying our 
crops and our house tops.  We were falsely locked up, then released 
without being charged.  Our legal properties were seized, and some 
stolen, under the disguise of law.  Our divine services were broken up at 
random. 
 
     The area, however, was mountainous, and very soon there was not 
enough pastureland for our cattle, and so, after settling in various 
parishes, such as St. Elizabeth, Manchester and Kingston, we finally 
settled at Coptic Heights, St. Thomas, once more in the East, for the 
final battle with modern Pharaoh.  With more land space, we were able to 
expand our resources and make sounder planning.  We were able to 
establish a fully accredited farming institution: - The Ethiopian Zion 
Coptic Church Farms Eternal Limited, compromising over one thousand acres 
of land fully cultivated and pastured.  On this farm we cultivate, 
vegetables, ground provisions, fruits, peanuts, escallion, thyme, onions, 
peas, melons, pumpkins, okras, bananas, sugar cane.  There is also over 
one thousand head of beef and dairy cattle, horses, donkeys, goats, 
sheep, mules and over two thousand head of poultry.  A native lumber 
industry is also operated by cutting wood from the trees on the farm and 
sometimes buying from outside supplies.  Coal is burned for the trade, 
and a stone quarry is operated.  We were also able to establish a 
trucking department which, along with the produce of the farm, assists 
the brethren in their everyday needs.  Today, as we look back at our past 
journey, and of a vast experiment of six thousand years, which are now 
coming to a close, the achievement that we have made, we now know that 
these could not be achieved by black alone, or white alone, yet by a 
united people, fulfilling the Mysteries of Goud in those who fear him and 
keep his commandments. 
 
COPTIC FOR OUR LIBERATION. 
 
     Coptic is the Bible understanding in this present generation.  The 
entire world today is burdened with SIN, from which, up to now, they have 
refused to be liberated. 
 
(1) Religion has failed to inspire the generation of today, because their 
doctrine of a sky god is bogus and without foundation, so that even the 
ministers of pagan religion are within themselves doubtful of its 
authenticity. 
 
(2) Commerce has failed, because, by their works, the inhabitants can see 
plainly that they are corrupt in their dealings and selfish in their 
gains.  This institution serves only to disorganise the people and to 
uphold the class barrier placed upon us by our slave masters, and so in 
this time we see the falling apart of Caesar's kingdom and the coming of 
Goud's divine reign on earth. 
(3) Politics, which is the third unclean spirit poured out upon the 
people, has now failed in its bid to inspire the people and lead them to 
a land of peace and safety.  Our political leaders are morally corrupted.  
They are treacherous to each other, much more the poor people.  They are 
the tools of commerce, to oppress the people so that they will be poorer 
and divided. 
 
     Coptic is the only LIGHT and SOLUTION in these times of troubled 
waters. The political leaders have left the people at the unknown 
crossroad; and all these great boasters who were acclaimed as shepherds 
of the people have now been found to be hirelings indeed. 
 
COPTIC THE SHEPHERD BRETHREN. 
 
     "I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd giveth his life for the 
sheep.  Yet he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the 
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth; 
and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. 
 
     The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for 
the sheep.  I am the good shepherd and I know my sheep and I am known of 
them.  As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay 
down my Life for the Sheep. 
 
     And other Sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must 
bring, and they will hear my voice; and there will be one fold, and one 
shepherd." 
 
     On the foundation of this Deity, handed down to us from our Father 
of old, the great Patriarch Abraham, and with the blessings he received 
from the great High Priest Melchizedek when they met in the plain of 
Mamre, the promise being from generation to generation, the Coptic 
Church, the advocate of this great spiritual Deity in these present 
times, is duty bound to enlighten those who are willing to open their 
moral equilibrium to the TRUTH as it affects them in these times.

WALTER WELLS' 1978 LETTER TO THE MIAMI HERALD 
 
     I greet you in the name of Louv, the first fruit of them that slept, 
the only Saviour of the world, for it covers a multitude of sins. 
 
     Having read in your valuable paper, various articles in connection 
with members and other operations of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church I 
am bound by duty to inform your many readers, as to what the "Coptic 
Church" is all about. 
 
History of the Church 
 
     The Coptic Church has been the first, and only true, christian 
church, since the early days of christianity, in the reign of the Roman 
empire.  Since the fall of the Roman empire, and the rise of the British 
empire, its members were taken captive into slavery, in various parts of 
the British West Indies, and North and South America. 
 
     In Jamaica, the headquarters of the slave trade, the work of the 
church was continued by the great black advocator, Paul Bogle, assisted 
financially by the great William Gordon, to whom millions worldwide have 
paid homage as Patriarchs and National Heroes.  Since the departure of 
these two advocates of black freedom from slavery, the race has been 
manipulated by oppressive colonial governments. 
 
     The year 1914 marked the end of colonial oppression of the black 
race, and the establishment of the black man's government.  It was in 
this year, that the slave masters of the time conspired against the 
freedom of the black race, and organized the United Nations, a worldwide 
political organization, whose duty it is to deprive the black race of its 
freedom.  Seeing that the black people (who by Bible history is Israel) 
had rebelled against their true Goud, and worshipped the pagan religious 
sky god Geysas, Goud rose up the Prophet Marcus Garvey, to declare to the 
black race worldwide, their rights, nationality, history and the 
declaration of the true and living Goud of Israel, Louv, who is from the 
foundation of the earth (Before Abraham was, I am). 
 
     The world at large is well acquainted with the works of this great 
prophet, and today the world at large is now seeing the fulfillment of 
his prophecies on the worldwide political systems, which stood in 
opposition to his true spiritual solidarity, of 'Africa for the Africans, 
those at home and those abroad.'  It was the leaders of the world's 
political governments, who opposed Marcus, and later manipulated the 
people by introducing party politics, which divided the people, thus 
causing wars, strife and hatred among the race. 
 
     Today it is the same political system, which continues to usurp the 
rights of the people, causing warfare and violence.  Each part (so 
rightly called, since they divide the people against themselves) are 
armed with their political gangsters, whose tool of plunder is the guns 
and bombs and other atrocious acts of violence upon a defenseless people.  
During the imprisonment of the prophet Marcus, worldwide politicians were 
able to indoctrinate the people into believing that he was dead.  As a 
result the vast majority of his followers, being hypnotized, returned to 
worship the pagan sky god Geysas, while many held the political belief 
that he had risen as the physical and now deceased Haille Salassie, 
political king of physical Ethiopia. 
 
     Yet, among his many disciples, was one faithful in heart, fervent in 
spirit, wisdom and knowledge, who like Marcus had spiritual hope in the 
redemption of the black race, as Goud's chosen people.  I speak of Louva 
Williams, a man eminent for his wisdom, and no less so for the genius to 
which not only men of piety, yet the world at large, must today pay 
homage. 
 
     Louva Williams is the continuance of the spiritual deity of Marcus 
Garvey, and had resurrected the true name of the ancient christian 
church, 'THE ETHIOPIAN ZION COPTIC CHURCH', first on University of the 
West Indies lands at Mona, Jamaica, then after strong political 
opposition, to Halls Delight, in the hills of St. Andrews, overlooking 
the city of Kingston.  Braving the storm of political harassment, the 
physical building was removed to White Horses, St. Thomas, Jamaica, where 
today it has established a firm foundation, both locally-and in all other 
nations abroad where the deity of Rastafari is being preached. 
 
Non-Political 
 
     The Coptic Church is not politically originated, and this was firmly 
expressed when we met with the political directorate of the land during 
the period of pre-incorporation.  We support no political organizations, 
pagan religion or commercial institution, seeing that religion, politics 
and commerce are the three unclean spirits which separate the people from 
their Goud.  We declare that guns, drugs, and all implements of human 
destruction are the tools of the worldwide political organization, so 
that the people would continue to fight, morally, against the 
establishment of Goud's peaceful kingdom on earth and thus be 
disinherited in his Paradise. 
 
     The Coptic Church is the representative of Goud's Theocratic 
government in today's world.  Our aims and precepts are, the teaching and 
spreading of belief in the Bible, the Moral Laws of Goud, the Fatherhood 
of Goud and the Brotherhood of man.  We declare that man because of 
disobedience transgressed the Moral Laws of Goud, whereby he is worthy of 
death under the law, yet through the louv of the father, he sent his only 
son for the remission of our sins, that we would have eternal life.  We 
declare that, in order to partake of this new life, we have to confess 
these wrongs before one another, and thus be forgiven one of another in 
Louv. 
 
Opposition 
 
     Because of our non-political stand, the church has received 
tremendous opposition from the politicians, who do not want the eyes of 
the people to be opened.  Through its agency, the police force, the 
church has been severely harassed, victimized and discriminated against.  
Our members have passed through several acts of police brutality, our 
legal properties maliciously destroyed, members falsely imprisoned, 
divine services broken up, and all these atrocities performed upon the 
Church, under the name of political laws and their justice. 
 
Our Declaration 
 
     We have no quarrel with them, we know the time has come, and now is, 
when the entire human race must be free from political oppression and 
return to the praise of the true Goud, "I.N.R.I." (I Negus Rule over 
Israel).  We declare that Goud made man in his own likeness, and so man 
therefore in himself is Goud.  Gen. 1:26, Deut. 6:15, St. John 10:32. 
 
     We declare that the bound duty of man is to praise Goud and live, 
not die.  Ecclesiastes 12:13-14.  We declare that Goud has given man a 
chance to redeem himself from the awful curse of death by choosing life 
through his son. 
 
     We declare that in order to live we must talk face to face with Goud 
as natural man and reason together.  Deut. 5:4 & 24.  We declare that the 
son of Goud, came in the likeness of sinful flesh, for sin, to condemn 
sin in the flesh.  We declare that the blood of Christ was shed for the 
entire world, and as such every individual has to account for the many 
deeds of shame, which they commit in their temple against the living 
Goud.  We declare that these political leaders are only boasters and have 
no love for fellowman.  Luke 11:39-44.  We declare that the apostles of 
Goud are given power to forgive sins also.  John 20:23.  We declare that 
these rulers of the people are false, and only feed themselves, not 
caring for the people.  Ezekiel 34.  We declare that Goud has raised up a 
plant of renown, so that the black race (known as Israel) would no more 
be consumed with hunger in the land, or bear the shame of colonial 
oppressors any more.  Ezekiel 34:29. 
 
Offerings of Devotion 
 
     With offerings of devotion, ships from the isles will meet, to pour 
the wealth of nations, and bring tribute at his feet.  The Coptic Church 
believes fully the teachings of the Bible, and as such we have our daily 
oblations, and offer our Sacrifices, made by fire unto our Goud with 
chants and Psalms and spiritual hymns, lifting up holy hands and making 
melody in our heart.  It would have been an empty void if I close without 
making a few comments on the Church's right to its Sacrament. 
 
     Herb is a Goudly creation from the beginning of the world.  It is 
known as weed of wisdom, angels food, the tree of life and even the 
"Wicked old Ganja tree."  Its purpose in creation is as a fiery sacrifice 
to be offered to our redeemer during oblations.  The political worldwide 
organizations have framed mischief on it and call it drugs.  To show that 
it is not a dangerous drug, let me inform my readers that it is used as 
food for mankind, and is still cooked as callalloo, and is used as a 
medicinal cure for all divers diseases.  Ganja is not for commerce, yet 
because of the oppression on the people, it was raised up at the only 
liberator of the people, and the only peacemaker among the entire 
generation.  Ganja is the sacramental rights of every black man worldwide 
and any laws against it is only the organized conspiracy of the United 
Nations and the political governments worldwide who assist in maintaining 
this conspiracy.  Let them know this is our liberation, let us all unite, 
for Ethiopia sons and daughters win this fight. 
 
     I do not wish to weary your patience, yet in closing let me bring to 
memory these words of a well known chant, and hope that as many as read 
these words, will be inspired to seek the truth from those who have 
suffered, and in doing so will revive their moral consciousness. 
 
 
Ethiopia the land of our father, 
The land where all gods louv to be, 
Each swiftly to all sudden gather, 
His children are gathered to thee. 
With our red, gold and green floating over, 
Our emperor shield us from wrong 
With our Goud and our future before us: 
We hail, and we shout and we chant. 
 
Chorus: 
Goud bless, Goud bless, our Negus I, 
Who keep Ethiopia free 
To advance with truth and right 
To advance with louv and light 
With righteousness leading, we hail to his call 
Humanity pleading, one Goud for us all 
 
(2) 
Ethiopia the tyrant is falling 
Who smote thee upon our knees 
And our children are lustily calling 
Over the distant seas 
Jehovah the great one, art near us 
He has noticed our sigh and our tear, 
With the spirit of Louv he has stirred us; 
To be one in this coming year. 
 
Chorus: 
Goud bless, Goud bless, our Negus I, 
Who keep Ethiopia free 
To advance with truth and right; 
To advance with louv and light 
With righteousness leading, we hail to his call. 
Humanity pleading, one Goud for us all. 
 
(3) 
Jehovah the Goud of our ages, 
Grant unto us a son, that we needed. 
The wisdom thou gave to his ages 
And Israel is now in need; 
Thy voice through the dim past was spoken, 
Ethiopia now stretch forth her hands; 
And by thee all those barriers been broken! 
And Zion bless our dear father's land. 
 
Chorus: 
Goud bless, Goud bless, our Negus I, 
Who keep Ethiopia free; 
To advance with truth and right! 
To advance with louv and light. 
With righteousness leading, we hail to his call 
Humanity pleading, one Goud for us all. 
 
     We sincerely trust that this review of our history, will prove 
worthwhile to the lost sheep of Israel, who have gone astray, knowing 
their King and Redeemer has made his appearance, not as a Lamb this time, 
yet as a frowning judge, to pay every man according to his work. 
 
     Thanking you for your past visit, and looking forward to seeing you 
again, 
 
                         Yours in the Master's service, 
                         Elder Walter Wells 
                         (Eld) Walter M. Wells - Spiritual Leader 
                         ETHIOPIAN ZION COPTIC CHURCH INC. 
 
P.S.  The Coptic Church is a covenant of four hundred and thirty years 
which cannot be dis-annulled.  We spent one hundred and thirty years 
under slavery building the Panama Canal and three hundred years under 
colonial oppression.  The rest of the time they rule over us is borrowed 
time.  It is now the people's time and Coptic is the church of the living 
man, the gatherer of the people.  It is Coptic time now. 
                                        W. Wells

Volume XII, Number 7<P>
<P>
	October 28, 1979<P>
<P>
DAN RATHER:  They call themselves the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  Their outraged neighbors and many law enforcement officials call them a fraud, a group of rich dopeheads who have been allowed to laugh at the law and get away with it.  That's because the Coptics insist that marijuana, which they call by its Jamaican name, ganja, is their sacrament.<P>
<P>
	Holy Smoke<P>
<P>
DAN RATHER:  One of the things we Americans have always accepted is that people have a right to practice their religion, no matter how unorthodox, without being molested by the law or by the rest of the community.  But there's a church in Florida now that lawmen say is stretching that proposition a lot further than most people can accept, at least a lot further than they can accept.<P>
<P>
The issue will be decided by a case before the Florida Supreme Court that could eventually wind up before the United States Supreme Court, and that issue is whether or not the state can prosecute members of a church who believe marijuana was given to them by God, and that smoking pot is for them a holy ritual.  Our story begins on Star Island in the coastal waterway between Miami and Miami Beach.<P>
<P>
Over the years, the people who've lived in this part of Miami Beach often have been famous, sometimes have been notorious, always have been wealthy.  The Duke of Windsor, the abdicated King Edward VIII, often stayed with friends in the island neighborhood.  Gangster Al Capone once had a not-so-small castle over there.  But even Al Capone could not have disturbed his neighbors as much as have the current residents of Number 43, Star Island.<P>
<P>
(Coptics chanting)<P>
<P>
They call themselves the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, a religion these white Americans claim has its roots in black Jamaica.  Their outraged neighbors and many law enforcement officials call them a fraud, a group of rich dopeheads who have been allowed to laugh at the law and get away with it.  That's because the Coptics insist that marijuana, which they call by its Jamaican name, ganja, is their sacrament; as valid and as necessary to them, they say, as wine is to Catholics during communion.<P>
<P>
These services take place three times a day, but the Coptics appear to partake of their sacrament just about all the time.  Their leader here on Star Island is a six foot seven inch former Catholic from Boston named Thomas Reilly.  He prefers to be known as Brother Louv.<P>
<P>
BROTHER LOUV:  Well, let's start from the beginning, page one of the Bible, Genesis, book one, verse 29:  "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth..."  Now, is there any dispute that marijuana is a green herb bearing seed that grows all over the earth?<P>
<P>
RATHER:  All right, let's -- let's address ourselves to the truth.  Is the basic message you should smoke ganja?<P>
<P>
BROTHER LOUV:  The basic message is you should stop your sin.  When you and I are neighbors and I have the security that you are a man who keeps the commandments of God, then I know you're not going to rob me, you're not going to murder me, you're not going to covet me.  So that's the only security that people can have is to stop their sinful ways, stop becoming homosexuals when they know what the Scripture says about homosexuality; they know what wisdom shows you about destroying your own seed of life.  They should stop their abortion.  They should stop their birth control.  They should stop their oral sex, their hand sex, and any way that they're destroying their own life and their own seed life.  They should stop those things immediately.  And they should have known to be smoking ganja from a long time.  For how is it that I know to?<P>
<P>
RATHER:  The Coptic Church bought this house in 1975 for $270,000, paid for in cash.  It's a kind of luxury commune with about 40 members, but a commune that adheres to the Bible, Old and New Testament teachings; a kind of combination of Billy Graham fundamentalism and Kosher law.  Though there is no formal marriage ceremony, the Coptic women must be faithful and subject to their husbands.  But the women, and even the Coptic children, are encouraged to smoke marijuana, and that's where the trouble first started.<P>
<P>
It was in early 1978 that the local Miami media began focusing in on activities of the Coptic Church.  While it was the constant chanting and the smell of marijuana that upset close neighbors on Star Island, it was those scenes of Coptic children smoking marijuana on local television that brought protests from the city as a whole.  Then in November, 1978, news broke of the mass deaths of the Peoples Temple cult in Jonestown, Guyana, and many Miami residents were shocked into wondering if they might not have a potential Jonestown on their doorstep.<P>
<P>
BROTHER LOUV:  I have no knowledge of Jim Jones except what I read in the paper.  And I read in the Bible that the wages of sin is death, and I understand he ran a homosexual, perverted, wife-swapping, adulterous, lecherous, camp somewhere in the jungle, and that many of the people were murdered and some committed suicide, and I'm not the least bit surprised.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  Nevertheless, the furor caused by the Coptic Church's activities led the state attorney to take action against them.  A civil action for public nuisance was brought against the Coptics, rather than a criminal charge for possession of marijuana.  The state attorney's office had in fact offered to drop all charges if the Coptics would move out of Star Island to some place where they were less conspicuous.  The Coptics flatly refused.  Instead, they hired the best and most expensive lawyers in town.  Milton Ferrell, Jr. is their chief defense attorney.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  All right, so it was a civil action; went before the judge.  The judge decided that, yes, this was a church under the definition of a church for First Amendment purposes, right?<P>
<P>
MILTON FERRELL, JR:  He decided it was a religion.  It was a --<P>
<P>
RATHER:  It was a religion.  And now the question before the Supreme Court is whether it is or isn't.<P>
<P>
FERRELL:  No, the question before the Supreme Court -- the Supreme Court's not concerned as to the sincerity of the religious belief, or as to whether or not marijuana's essential to the conduct of the religion, nor whether the religion is a religion under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.  Those findings can't be challenged in the Supreme Court.  Those have been found as a fact already.  There's no controversy about that at all.  The controversy in the supreme court of Florida is this:  whether the State has a compelling state interest sufficient to override the fundamental interest of any citizen of the United States to practice their religion without governmental interference in it.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  The implications of such a confrontation, says Florida Assistant State Attorney Henry Adorno, extend far beyond the Coptic Church.<P>
<P>
HENRY ADORNO:  If a court were to rule that the Coptics do have a First Amendment right, then I think that would be the opening of the floodgates for possible legalization of marijuana in Florida.  I, as a prosecutor, would then have to go around and decide who to arrest for possession of marijuana.  They obviously would then come up with the defense, "Well, I'm a Coptic," or "I have, you know, I believe that marijuana is my sacrament," which would then muddle the criminal system to no end in trying to defend or trying to prosecute a case where the defense is First Amendment grounds.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  Meanwhile, quite aware of all the legal problems they have caused, the Coptics continue their activities at Star Island.  While the constitutional issue is debated, a federal civil rights ruling allows them to go on smoking marijuana unmolested.  One court battle, the right to be considered a church, has already been won.  But just what sort of church is it?<P>
<P>
The Coptics claim that their mother church is on the Caribbean island of Jamaica.  Brother Louv and his American brethren first came to Jamaica in the early seventies.  They were all graduates of Haight-Ashbury and the campuses of the sixties, a remnant of a lost generation.  They came looking for marijuana, and they found it and bought it in the slums of Kingston from this Jamaican, Keith Gordon.  At the same time, Gordon introduced them to an obscure Christian sect.  This was the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, which claimed for years that the blacks of Africa were the original Jews of the Bible, and that the slaves of the New World were their direct descendants.  Marijuana, or ganja, was the "holy herb".  Ripe for a new spiritual experience, these Americans could have found nothing better than a religion that extolled the poor, the black man and marijuana all in one tidy package.<P>
<P>
Coptic Heights lies 30 miles outside Kingston.  The Coptic Church owns as far as the eye can see.  They have roads.  They have trucks, lots of trucks.  They have a dozen corporations trading under different names.  To the average Jamaican, these Coptics are efficient, prosperous and highly suspect.<P>
<P>
DAWN RITCH:  What they're doing is, on an organized basis, exporting marijuana to Miami.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  Jamaican journalist Dawn Ritch.<P>
<P>
RITCH:  The group in Miami at Star Island, they are the backers.  They're the people with the money.  They control this thing that they would like to pretend is a church.  It is no church.  That is a factory for the export of ganja.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  Law enforcement agencies say that with his new-found American friends, Keith Gordon's marijuana business took off like a turpentined cat.  From being a small-time pusher, he quickly grew to head an organization that controlled cultivation and large-scale distribution right into the United States.  Today, the majority of marijuana grown illegally in fields such as this throughout Jamaica has already been presold to Brother Keith and the Coptics.  It's prime marijuana that's much in demand.<P>
<P>
RITCH:  Columbia marijuana, Mexican marijuana, is between two and four percent THC.  Our marijuana is between four and eight percent.  So we are genuinely the source.  Also closest.  But Coptic has, I am told, 7,000 acres of farm in Colombia, as well.  We are now a branch, you see.  They claim, in -- in Florida, that we are the source, we are the home of this church.  We are simply a branch of a multinational corporation operating on the wrong side of the law.<P>
<P>
BROTHER LOUV:  When -- when you talk about smuggling, what do you mean by smuggling?<P>
<P>
RATHER:  It is not a fact that you are in the business, the business, of smuggling marijuana into the United States?<P>
<P>
BROTHER LOUV:  I have no knowledge of even what you're thinking about, much less what you're talking about.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  The United States Coast Guard here in Florida long has been interested in activities of the Zion Coptic Church, as have the FBI, the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, the Florida Department of Criminal Law Enforcement, and even the Miami Beach police.<P>
<P>
One of The Miami Beach police who, as an undercover agent, recently spent a lot of time investigating the Coptic Church is Sergeant Rick Baretto.<P>
<P>
Tell me, if you can and if you will, what I am dealing with when I'm dealing with Brother Louv and Star Island.  What is this about?<P>
<P>
SERGEANT RICK BARETTO:  I don't know.  I really don't.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  You looked into it for two years and you don't know what it's about?<P>
<P>
SERGEANT BARETTO:  That's correct.  They obviously have had -- been in a financial situation where they can afford a lot of very high-priced attorneys.  So they've been able to successfully tie us up time and time again and -- through litigation.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  That's the way the system works, isn't it?<P>
<P>
SERGEANT BARETTO:  The wheels turn slowly, yes, sir.<P>
<P>
FEMALE PATROL BOAT PILOT:  This is Coast Guard 459, Coast Guard 459, over.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  On at least two occasions in this state alone, members of the church have been arrested in very large drug busts.  November, 1977, Marion County, Florida: 13 tons of marijuana found hidden in a tunnel on a farm owned by the church.  February, 1978, Citrus County, Florida: 20 tons of marijuana taken off the vessel Our Seas, owned by the church; 16 persons arrested, including Brother Louv's fellow church leader, Keith Gordon of Jamaica.  However, none of the charges stuck.  May 14th, 1979: Marion County charges dropped.  May 22nd, 1979: Citrus County charges dropped.  Lack of solid evidence cited as the reasons; that the state had found church members around marijuana, but was unable to establish a direct link between the members and the confiscated dope.  So, the fact remains - and this is important - that not a single member of the Zion Coptic Church ever has been convicted of possessing so much as a single ounce of marijuana in any court in - the state of Florida.<P>
<P>
Is this whole church, based so conveniently in Miami and Jamaica, just a cover for large-scale organized crime?  Well, no, it's certainly not as simple as that.  All the law enforcement agencies who have investigated the Coptics agree: they cannot be faulted on the sincerity of their religious views.  Moreover, the Coptics have never, never been linked in any way with the smuggling of hard drugs, cocaine and heroin, that right now is so rampant throughout Florida.  Nor with other activities associated with so-called mafioso crime, such as prostitution, gambling and gun-running.  None of these would be consistent with the Coptics' professed beliefs.  Marijuana, and only marijuana, is what the Coptics are about.  To them it is a holy mission.<P>
<P>
(Coptics singing in religious ceremony)<P>
<P>
RATHER:  Back in Miami, the Coptics are pursuing that mission with all the zeal of a political candidate running for office.  They recently hired a production company to film their every move, and they study their screen performances with great care.  They advertise themselves, together with a biblical plug for marijuana, in the Miami telephone book Yellow Pages.  And they publish an expensive newspaper which details with relish their latest costly legal battles.  Where does Brother Louv say he gets the money to do all this?<P>
<P>
BROTHER LOUV:  I want you to consider that you're talking to a spiritual person who has solved the physical problems, and we should be talking about the matters that could uplift everyone who's hearing us right now.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  Well, where will the money for this thing come from?<P>
<P>
BROTHER LOUV:  Do you read in the Scripture money is the tool of the Devil.  The love of money is the root of all evil.  We love the blessing.  Within blessing we've found a higher way of thinking than dollars and cents.  Money is a tool.  A worldly tool.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  How do you feel about the Internal Revenue Service case, which is several (indistinct cross-talk) --<P>
<P>
BROTHER LOUV:  They're a bunch of robbers and thieves and whores!<P>
<P>
RATHER:  The Internal Revenue Service?<P>
<P>
BROTHER LOUV:  Robbers, thieves and whores.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  On what evidence do you (indistinct cross-talk)?<P>
<P>
BROTHER LOUV:  They have no integrity.  They have no foundation.  They all have little soft, pink, fleshly little hands.  They sit in offices all day long trying to rob the people.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  Brother Louv's brotherly love clearly wears a little thin when reminded of the Internal Revenue Service. Recently, estimating the value of automobiles, property, boats and the amount of marijuana seized so far, the IRS and the U.S. Customs presented the Coptics with a bill for back taxes and penalties totaling $l8-million.  Privately, law enforcement officers hope that the tax man may succeed where the police have so far failed, and bring down the Coptic Church.  The Coptics have simply refused to pay, and to them it's just one court case among many.<P>
<P>
Their minds, and a great deal of their money, are right now tied up in a legal battle of greater significance which they are determined to win, if necessary by going all the way to the United States Supreme Court.<P>
<P>
If you were to become Brother Louv's defense attorney, an unlikely prospect, I think you'll agree --<P>
<P>
ADORNO:  I agree.<P>
<P>
RATHER:  -- and you were advising him, where is the greatest danger to him legally?<P>
<P>
ADORNO:  Legally it's in the decisions that are -- in the mood of the -- of the country.  I don't think this country is ready for the legalization of marijuana, or at least the state of Florida is not ready for that.  And I think that for him to win his battle, he's going to have to fight the greater battle, which is not -- not only allowing Coptics to smoke marijuana, but take the one step further and having marijuana legalized.  I think that's the only way that he's ultimately going to win his battle.<P>
<P>
BROTHER LOUV:  Not -- from the time you say legalized, that to me sounds like whisky, and whisky's something you can buy from the government but if you make your own they'll put you in jail.  So that does not apply to marijuana.  Marijuana, ganja, is free.  We're not fighting for the freedom or the legalization.  We're declaring that it is and always has been free.<P>

LOUV STORY<P>
Are Brother Louv and his Zion Coptic Church facing the Last Judgment?<P>
Tropic, The Miami Herald, August 2, 1981<P>
<P>His real name is Thomas Reilly, but you probably know him only as Brother Louv of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  For several years, the members of this church have outraged the community by their blatant use of marijuana, which they call ganja and consider a sacrament.  Because the law calls it dope and considers it illegal, nine church members were convicted this year of smuggling.  In the fall, Reilly goes on trial and could be sent to jail for life.  Is the system harassing this religion unfairly, or are the Coptics nothing but big-time smugglers?  The story begins on page 6.  The cover photograph is by Mary Lou Foy.<P>
<P>
THE LAW AND BROTHER LOUV<P>
Are they persecuting a church or prosecuting a smuggler?<P>
By CARL HIAASEN<P>
CARL HIAASEN is a Miami Herald staff writer<P>
	One night early last year, in the foyer of the large house at 43 Star Island, a bony, balding man of 6-foot-7 danced on his toes, popping knobby fists into the air.<P>
	"I can feel the noose loosen around my neck," he said with a snaggletoothed grin.  "I hope they bring on the biggest, meanest f------ they got.  That's the one I want to beat.<P>
	The shadowboxer was Thomas Francis Reilly Jr., better known as Brother Louv, ambassador of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  "They" was the U.S. government.<P><P>
	It was February 1980, a heady time for Reilly and the Coptics.  Fresh from a "60 Minutes" segment, they felt sure the U.S. Supreme Court would listen to their arguments for the sacramental use of marijuana, which they call ganja.<P>
	And they had high hopes for an unusual legal petition, filed by their attorneys with a Miami judge, that put forth a comprehensive case for the relative harmlessness of cannabis sativa.<P>
	In that motion, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark had asked the government to dismiss a list of serious smuggling-related charges against the Coptics, arguing for the First Amendment rights of the church faithful to smoke marijuana during prayer.<P>
	This is why Reilly was so elated.  For once the lawyers had done what the Coptics wanted, which was to tell the world that nothing is wrong with marijuana.  Medical doctors, psychiatrists, research scientists, cancer victims, and glaucoma patients testified for the Coptics in pretrial hearings.<P>
	It is hard to tell whether Reilly, who is an intelligent man, really believed that U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler was going to go for this approach.  Hoeveler didn't.  He said the issue was smuggling, not religion, so the Coptics went to trial.<P>
	The government turned out to be bigger and meaner than Reilly had anticipated.  Two months ago a jury convicted nine out of nine Coptics on 45 out of 45 smuggling and conspiracy counts.<P>
	Reilly was spared only because his attorney got sick.  He will go to trial again soon and, if convicted faces 10 years to life in prison.  "I don't like that prospect," he says pensively now.<P>
	Much has happened to the Coptic Church in recent months, none of it good.  And if Reilly -- the most visible, articulate and telegenic of the Coptic leaders -- goes to prison, the future of the church of ganja would be in jeopardy.<P>
	Of course, that would suit many people just fine: federal prosecutors, state prosecutors, drug agents, tax investigators, and the city of Miami Beach, for starters.<P>
	When the television cameras are gone, and the lustrous ceremonial robes are closeted, Thomas Reilly stops preaching and starts talking like a man who's looking at a lot of jail time.<P>
	"I'll be damned if I'm going to be considered a criminal because of ganja," he says quietly.  "It's a mismatch.  One man is using his wits and his prayers, and the other is using guns and informers and stakeouts."<P>
	There is no doubt that Reilly and the other Coptic leaders devoutly religious about marijuana.  There is also no doubt, authorities say, that the Coptics are big-time dope smugglers; there is simply no other explanation for what has happened.<P><P>
	By dint of an eager media and the congregation's own affection for the melodramatic, the Coptics have come to be regarded as something of a Miami Beach freak show, Cheech and Chong Get Religion.<P>
	In fact, the rigid and narrow Coptic doctrine has more in common with Jerry Falwell.  Among the modern "perversions" the Coptics sententiously denounce: birth control, abortion, fornication, adultery, oral sex, masturbation, homosexuality and the use of alcohol or any hard drugs.<P>
	"If it weren't for the marijuana," Reilly likes to say, "we would be the Moral Majority."<P>
	Through an open window at Star Island comes the sound of Psalms being recited by women and children, then slow singing.  "This is our defense camp," he says, raising a smoke-stained hand.<P>
	Reilly sits in a living room filled with fine furniture, heavy Jamaican mahogany.  The carpets are Persian.  A Betamax is in one corner.  Reilly makes no apologies for the wealth of the church, or for the Cadillac and Mercedes-Benz in the driveway.<P>
	He is 38, well-spoken and media-wise.  Last year a UCLA psychiatrist tested Reilly's IQ at 150 -- "not bad for a guy who's supposed to be blown out."<P>
	His white slacks and open shirt hang from a gaunt frame.  As always, he wears sandals.  Consistent with church tenets, he has not cut his hair in years.   He is missing some front teeth.<P>
	The ritual smoking that begins each morning before dawn continues "every minute of every day."  Reilly cleans a long clay chillum pipe, then packs it with a 50-50 mixture of marijuana and tobacco.  Hot embers are tapped into the open bowl, while a damp cloth is folded over the smoker's end to keep live sparks out of the lungs.<P>
	The Coptics "partake" of marijuana in short inhalations.  They condemn as sinful the deep-sucking recreational pot smokers.  At Star Island there is no giddy joint-passing.  At this meeting, after a full day of smoking, Reilly is about as atoned as your average F-I6 pilot.  Which is to say, not at all.<P><P>
	He came to the Coptic Church in 1970, one of many disenchanted Peace Movement dropouts who found their way to the hills of Jamaica.  Reilly was born and raised in Boston, son of an RCA Victor sales executive, eldest of five children, a Catholic altar boy and prep school basketball ace who wanted nothing more than to attend West Point.<P>
	Instead he came to the University of Miami, didn't make the basketball team ("Rick Barry was here then," he explains ruefully) and finally left school.  He became a salesman at Litton Industries, eventually starting his own data processing business.<P>
	Reilly smoked his first joint at 25.  Later he moved to San Francisco, dropped some acid and began experimenting with other drugs.  "I've known the life of a hippie, going from rock festival to rock festival, living out of a tent," he says.  "I did all that."<P>
	In Kingston, Jamaica, Reilly became fascinated with the ganja men.  He "confessed" his sins to the elders of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, and was adopted as one of the first white brothers.  His credo became the Book of Genesis, Chapter One, verses 29-31:  "And God said, Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed ...."<P>
	The "herb" was marijuana.  The Burning Bush was marijuana.  The plants on Solomon's grave were marijuana.  Everywhere in the Bible, the Coptics assert, you find pot.<P>
	Question:  How do you know the Bible is talking about ganja?<P>
	Reilly:  History.  Prophecy.  Reality.  I never questioned that.  We're talking about communion.  It is divinity.<P>
	Q:  But how do you know the Bible isn't talking about parsley, or ragweed?  Other herbs?<P>
	Reilly:  Is the word ganja in the Bible?  No.  Is the word marijuana in the Bible?  No.  Is the Bible a medical dictionary, or is the Bible a book of mystics and symbols and parables?<P>
	In other forms the same argument has been offered by other Coptics.<P>
	"What else would you substitute, if not ganja?" demanded Laurenton Dickens, a black church elder who sometimes stays at Star Island.  "It is my daily bread," he says, lighting a pipe.  "It is the first thing I pick up when I rise in the morning, and the last thing I lay down when I go to sleep at night."<P>
	"A burnt offering," said Clifton Ray Middleton, 32, a thin white Coptic priest.  It was Middleton's wife, Jacquelyn Town, who purchased the verdant Star island compound six years ago for $270,000 cash.  The money was provided by a Jamaican Coptic elder, Keith Gordon.<P>
	Question:  Where did the money come from?<P>
	Middleton:  Where do any churches get any of their money?<P>
	Q:  Tithing?<P>
	Middleton:  The wealth of the Coptic Church is the wealth of the black race.<P>
	Several months after this interview, Middleton and 22 others, many of them Coptics, were arrested on the coast of Maine during a waterfront bust that netted about 27 tons of marijuana.<P><P>
	In addition, Middleton -- who has used the names Peter Sheets and Stanley Gilmore -- was one of the nine Coptics convicted of smuggling in Miami last June; he awaits sentencing in that case.  Today he is serving a 30-month term for a 1972 smuggling charge.<P>
	Middleton's wife and newborn daughter wait at Star Island, which pokes into Biscayne Bay from the McArthur Causeway.  Things here have been quiet; the neighbors have not complained recently.<P>
	The Coptics' bayfront property has a 24-hour security guard.  The big swimming pool has been drained and fenced off.  The Coptics have planted potatoes, papaya trees and peas in the yard.  Most of their food and meat comes from farmland they own off Chrome Avenue.<P>
	The first floor of the main house at Star Island is decorated with religious wall hangings; there are also books and blackboards for the Coptic children, who do not attend public school.  There is a video recording center, and a Telex machine with which Reilly can communicate instantly with the Coptics' freighter in the Caribbean.<P>
	In the chapel area are pianos, organs and drums.  This is where the Zion Coptics chant, pray and smoke their ganja, and they did so unmolested until 1978 when it all hit the fan.<P><P>
	The Coptics say 43 Star Island is but an embassy; the headquarters of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is in Jamaica.<P>
	Although law enforcement authorities believe the church is merely a front for a massive pot-smuggling operation, the Florida Supreme Court has recognized the Coptic faith as a true religion whose doctrine stretches back 6,000 years.<P>
	The exact heritage of the church, however, remains indistinct and fragmented.  It was not incorporated until 1976.  Its membership is debated: drug authorities say fewer than 200; Reilly says thousands.<P>
	The Zion Coptics identify as their prophet Marcus Garvey, whose back-to-Africa exhortations in the 192Os gave birth to the Ethiopian Movement in Jamaica.  But unlike the Rastafarians, who also believe in the ritualistic use of ganja, the Zion Coptics do not advocate the repatriation of a11 blacks to Africa.  They believe the foundation of the black race is in Jamaica.<P>
	The founder of the Coptic sect is said to be Louva Williams, a carpenter's son who began spreading the doctrine in Jamaica in the 1940s.  It was Williams who devised the "reasoning" sessions, lengthy theological dialogues among the men of the church, accompanied always by marijuana smoking.<P>
	Through Williams, the present Coptic doctrine took form.  When he died in 1969, the church collapsed.  Church lore has it that Williams' spirit appeared to George Baker Ivy, a young Jamaican who struggled to reassemble the scattered brethren.<P>
	Ivy was the first elder to admit whites into the "camp," and in fact encouraged disaffected young Americans to come to the island and learn the ways of the ganja church.  Reilly, Middleton and other young priests-to-be arrived soon afterward.<P>
	"You know the last time I took a pill?" Reilly says.  "I took LSD in an airplane over Cuba in 1970, on my way to Jamaica.  And I met these brothers and I haven't taken an aspirin since then, haven't talked to a doctor.  I was converted, I was resurrected, I was cleansed, whatever you want to call it, I found the culture of the ganja men."<P>
	Reilly and his middle-class companions turned their backs on worldly "corruption" to embrace the rigorous and inflexible Coptic doctrine.  The men follow the Levitican laws against cutting their hair or beards.  Women have a "servile" position in the church; they must cover their hair, arms and legs at all time in public.<P>
	Within the church there is no marriage ceremony: a man who sleeps with a woman simply is considered her husband for life.  She is expected to "be fruitful" and have babies.<P>
	On these matters, the Zion Coptic Church is intransigent.<P>
	Unlike most denominations which label themselves Christian, the Coptic Church does not worship Jesus Christ in a traditional role.  Rather, Coptics believe Him to be a black man, crucified not in Jerusalem but in Jamaica, in an act of racial aggression.<P>
	Moreover, the Coptics believe in the concept of "Jes-us," a living God embodied within all men.  Attaining this state of self-perfection requires constant prayers, and the prayers require ganja.  A whole heap of ganja.<P><P>
	The obscurity of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church ended on Nov. 28, 1977. That was the day police raided a farm in the North Florida town of Dunnellon and found 27,738 pounds of marijuana hidden in a barn and in an elaborate system of tunnels.  The property belonged to one Peter Sheets, actually Clifton Middleton.<P>
	Among those busted was another prominent American Coptic, an Iowa law school graduate named Carl D. Swanson.  Swanson was released on bail, but he didn't stay out of trouble long.<P>
	On Feb. 2, 1978, police staking out a secluded area along the Cross-Florida Barge Canal arrested Swanson and 15 other suspects during an alleged marijuana offloading operation.  Nineteen tons of grass were seized, as was a 68-foot motor yacht which had been purchased by the Coptics for $225,000 cash.<P>
	A Cadillac belonging to Thomas Reilly also was confiscated at the offloading site.  It was the closest police would ever come to catching Brother Louv at a smuggling operation.<P>
	Even more damaging to the church was the arrest at the scene of Zion Coptic elder Keith Gordon, known reverently as "Niah" to his Jamaican followers.<P>
	Within a month, the Internal Revenue Service revoked the tax-exempt status of the church and socked it with a $3-million lien (still pending).  Not far behind was the U.S. Customs Service, which levied a $15-million import penalty against the Coptics for failing to declare the 19 tons of grass as cargo.  "If they give it back," Reilly offered good-humoredly, "we'll pay the tax."<P>
	Government investigators became curious about the source of the Coptic wealth.  IRS Agent Mike Marr testified that, between 1973 and 1977, church members spent $910,O00 cash on a small flotilla.<P>
	The church response:  Its income was legitimately derived from "substantial" holdings in Jamaica, including property, a container company, a trucking firm and an auto parts agency.<P>
	One man who thought, then as now, that the church was a front for smuggling was Manny Funes, an agent for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE).  Reilly says Funes is "our most bitterest enemy," for it was Funes who helped the U.S. government piece together its successful case against the Coptics.<P>
	"It is my opinion that they are the biggest exporters of marijuana in Jamaica," Funes says.  "What we've done is not stopped them one bit, insofar as the smuggling goes.  We've slowed them down ... but we haven't stopped them."<P>
	As the full weight of the state and federal government came down on the Church in 1978 and 1979, the city of Miami Beach was receiving complaints from the Coptics' Star Island neighbors.  The big problem was the prayer chants, at all hours of the day, and the accompanying, distinctive odor of marijuana.<P>
	A Beach police raid netted $91,000 cash and a few marijuana sprouts, but public opinion was ignited most by television footage showing Coptic children toking on stogie-sized marijuana "spliffs."  Curious teenagers began to gather outside the Coptic gates.<P>
	The Dade State Attorney's Office asked for -- and won -- an injunction banning pot smoking at 43 Star Island.<P>
	Thomas Reilly had by now christened himself Brother Louv and was conducting regular press conferences.  "Have you ever heard of the attempted liquidation of a church?" he stormed.  "No murder.  No robbery.  Just marijuana.  Is that historic or not?"<P>
	Said Clifton Middleton:  "The ganja smokers of America are the silent majority.  We will win."<P><P>
	But the Coptics have not won much of anything so far.<P>
	Although the Florida Supreme Court conceded that the Coptics' use of marijuana "is an essential portion of the religious practice," it also upheld the local ban on pot smoking at 43 Star Island.  "A threat to public safety and welfare," the Court declared.<P>
	Arguing that they had as much right to use marijuana as the Navajo Indians do to use peyote, church members appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Last October the High Court refused to hear the case.<P>
	Dade Assistant State Attorney Arthur Berger, who represented the state, asserted that the Coptics' argument was phony:  "It's like Al Capone setting up a saloon during Prohibition.  Instead of calling himself a racketeer, he says, 'I'm a high priest.  Come join my church.'  You think he'll get converts?  Hell, yes!"<P>
	More bad news came to the Coptics two weeks after the High Court rebuffed them.  A boat called Jubilee landed off the coast of Maine with 1,263 bales of Colombian marijuana.  Middleton and several other Coptics -- six of them fugitives -- were arrested at the scene.<P>
	Hemorrhaging badly from legal fees and bail demands, the Coptics did not need another multiton bust.  Reilly says the Maine fiasco has already cost them more than $1 million.  The trials are set for September.<P>
	Question:  The government says the Coptics were going to sell this stuff, that it wasn't for personal use ... was this grass going to be sold on the street?<P>
	Reilly:  No.  Why couldn't it be for personal use?<P>
	Q.  But the government is going to say, 'We could see a couple hundred pounds for personal use, maybe, but not 27 tons.<P>
	Reilly:  Does the Catholic Church -- St. Peter's or whatever it is here -- go out and buy three quarts of wine for next Sunday, or does it buy 100 cases?<P><P>
	Milton Ferrell, Jr. is a tall and gregarious defense lawyer, an ex-prosecutor.  He genuinely likes his Coptic clients, but admits he's had easier times behind the defense table.<P>
	"I represent a good many drug smugglers," Ferrell says, "and, you know they are always so grateful when I show up to help `em.  'Milton, I'll do whatever you want me to, I'll say whatever you want me to.  Here, take the money.  Just get me off!"<P>
	"Not these people.  They are proud of what they are doing.  They tell the government, `Hell, yes, I've got marijuana, and I've got the right to do it.'"<P>
	Besides Ferrell, the Coptics have retained a battery of top lawyers -- Ramsey Clark, former State Attorney Richard Gerstein, Murray Sams, Terry McWilliams, to name a few.  The Coptics are not impressed.  By and large, they despise all lawyers.  Reilly says they are a necessary evil.<P>
	They are most necessary because early on the morning of Nov. 20, 1979, a tow truck used by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) rammed the wrought iron gates at 43 Star Island, followed by 35 cops armed with a 15-page federal indictment.<P>
	Nineteen persons, mostly Coptics, were charged with conspiracy to violate the Controlled Substances Act.  Additionally, Reilly, Middleton and Keith Gordon were accused of conducting a continuing criminal enterprise, a huge pot-smuggling ring.<P>
	One prominent Coptic not named as a defendant was Carl Swanson.  He had been decapitated when a small pot-laden airplane clipped a radio tower and crashed in the Everglades in September 1979.<P>
	In sweeping fashion, the U.S. government accused church members of using ships, airplanes and outright bribery to smuggle 105 tons of marijuana into the country since 1973.  Included in the government's tally of tonnage -- which the Coptics say was ludicrous -- were the 19 tons from the Cross-Florida Barge Canal and the 14 tons from the barn in Dunnellon.<P>
	After his arrest at Star Island, Thomas Reilly was taken in handcuffs to the federal courthouse, where he gave Miami television viewers a memorable moment.  "I'm a priest, man!" he shouted to reporters over his shoulder.  "Look what they're doing to a f------ priest!"<P><P>
	January 1980.  White Horses, Jamaica.<P>
	"You got a light?"<P>
	Daniel is a bouncy Coptic kid with hay-colored hair down to the middle of his back.  Poised in his 7-year-old hand is a joint the size of a Dutch Masters.<P>
	"Got a light?" he asks again, then prances away.<P>
	"Some of them are real burners, laughs Alan Meyerson.  "They can smoke 10 times as much as you."<P>
	Meyerson is acting as tour guide at Coptic Heights, world headquarters for the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  The compound sits high in the steep hills of White Horses, an impoverished farming district 30 miles north of Kingston.  From the summit, the vista in all directions is Coptic, at least 2,000 acres.<P>
	"Our nation," says Meyerson, a white Coptic priest.  "This is to show the world what the ganja man can do."<P>
	"Where did the church get the money for this land?"<P>
	"This isn't from money, this is from the labor of our hands.  Do you see any money here?  Money isn't the problem or solution.  You might as well ask where the banana plant comes from."<P>
	A Jeep tour of Coptic Heights is arranged.  The driver is young Paul Toledo, late of Miami Beach, who puffs heartily on a spliff while negotiating the mountain roads with enviable certitude.<P>
	On all sides is the Coptic farm:  plantain, red peas, carrots, yams, pumpkins, papayas, tobacco, cane, pineapples, cocoa and peanuts.  In four years the church has turned fallow land into one of the island's most productive farm communities.  Coptic Heights is self-reliant, with its own reservoir, irrigation system, gas depot, generator, even its own sawmill.  The lend is turned by more than a thousand workers, many non-Coptics.<P>
	Above the farmlands is the church itself, a modest round structure with a slight dome beneath a luminous sign.<P>
	Though the church claims thousands of black Jamaican followers, there are only about 60 in residence on the farm.  Many have assigned responsibilities: the motor pool, the cattle herds, the peanut fields.<P>
	Brother Alan Meyerson is not involved in such details.  He is on the phone frequently to Thomas Reilly at Star Island, plotting strategy.  It was Meyerson, for example, who arranged a visit by several physicians to examine Jamaican church members who have been smoking marijuana for year.<P>
	Though the examinations were brief and limited, the conclusions were laudatory.  Typical were the findings of Dr. Arthur Fournier, University of Miami School of Medicine:  "I could determine no evidence -- on history or physical examination -- of any adverse effects on their health which could be attributed to the long-term smoking of marijuana."<P>
	One of the subjects studied was the man believed by many to be the head of the whole church, Keith Gordon, "Niah" himself.  It was Gordon who supposedly selected this spot as Coptic Heights, who pointed to a barren hillside and commanded his minions to dig, whereupon they unearthed the natural spring which today nourishes the Coptic valleys.<P>
	Gordon sits in a deep soft chair, a shy Coptic woman on his left, awaiting orders.  Like most Coptic men, Gordon carries a towel slung over one shoulder.  Every now and then he pauses to hack into it.  He has been smoking ganja for 33 years, and that adds up to one ferocious cough.<P>
	A federal arrest warrant still awaits Gordon in Miami.  He has offered to give himself up, but U.S. prosecutors have not extradited him because of a gap in Jamaican laws that essentially makes it impossible to prosecute Gordon for conspiracy here.<P>
	Gordon:  Dey say I bring in 20 tons.  Liars.  Where is it?  We don't break no law.  We don't commit no crimes.  Two hundred fifdy dousand people march in San Francisco and call themselves gay!  Ha!  Dare are no indictments about dat.  Why not?<P>
	Question: Are you innocent of the smuggling charges?  Or do you say that there is nothing wrong with ganja, and therefore you have done nothing wrong?<P>
	Gordon:  What dey say I do, I didn't do.  And dere's nothing wrong wid ganja ... who do you tink made the herb?<P>
	Q:  God?<P>
	Gordon:  Do you tink He make someding bad for you?  No.  You can't f--- wid God's work.<P>
	FDLE agent Manny Funes says that Keith Gordon is the brains behind the Coptics.  Clifton Middleton is the organizer and Thomas Reilly is the mouthpiece.  However, Kingston journalist Arthur Kitchens believes Reilly runs the whole show from Miami Beach.<P>
	Although the use of ganja is as old as Jamaica, the Zion Coptic Church has not been a powerful religious movement.  During one court hearing in Miami, anthropologist Tasfaye Gulilat, a member of the Ethiopian Orthodox Coptic Church, testified he had never heard of the Zion Coptics until he saw some news film on television.<P>
	"We are exalted here," Meyerson says.<P>
	Coptic Heights is laid out so that the road up the mountains to the main gate is clearly visible from the church and living quarters.  When Jamaican police stage a raid, as they sometimes do, the Coptics can literally see them coming a mile away.  By the time the cops arrive, the ganja is usually stashed out of sight.<P>
	Three times a day the church members file into the tabernacle -- men in the center, women in back -- passing pipes and spliffs while children lead the Psalms and singing.  The prayer sessions last hours, often into the early morning, drums keeping time.<P>
	All oblations are voluntary, which becomes a significant consideration at 3 in the morning as the singing breaks like a wave over the dark Jamaican valley. If all this is really a fraud, the Coptics are going to epic lengths to preserve the charade.<P>
	Even Manny Funes, who has played a large role in the Coptics' prosecution, admires their zeal.<P>
	"You know, they never shaved their heads or their beards to disguise themselves, and that would have made it very difficult to identify them," he says.<P>
	"That's why I think they believe in something.  They believe in marijuana as a sacrament."<P>
	In a few weeks, Thomas Reilly will go on trial for allegedly spearheading a conspiracy to import a mountain of marijuana in the name of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.<P>
	Federal prosecutor Barbara Schwartz has not yet decided whether or not to ask for a life sentence if Reilly is convicted.  "I definitely think he is a danger to the community, and to the country as a whole, with this smuggling operation," she says.<P>
	On the issue of smuggling, Reilly is coy.  On charges that the Coptics intended to peddle the pot they were caught with, he is adamant in his denials.  "I would so much rather have a constitutional trial on the issue of ganja and our generation," Reilly says.  <P>
	The government would rather not.  The court will likely be most interested in two subjects that the Coptics do not like to discuss:  how they get their money, and how they get their marijuana.<P>
	Reilly promises, "It will be a clash of light and darkness, not, 'Where were you that night?'"<P>
	<P>
	It would he simple for Brother Louv to shed forever the drug agents, the tax man, the prosecutors, so easy to hop a Learjet and melt safely into the hills of Jamaica with his mentor Keith Gordon.<P>
	But that would prove nothing, and leave the Zion Coptic Church voiceless in the United States.  So Reilly says he's prepared for jail:  "I'd rather be a martyr than a fugitive."  Any good priest, he explains between puffs, would do the same.<P>

<I>United States v. Middleton</I>, 690 F.2d 820, 824-826 (11th Cir. 1982)

<B>II. FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION</B>

  Middleton also asserts that the federal statutes prohibiting the 
importation and possession of marijuana, as applied in this case, violate 
the free exercise clause of the first amendment of the United States 
Constitution.  In support of this assertion, Middleton argues that he is a 
dedicated member of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, that this church is a 
religion within the meaning of the first amendment, and that the use of 
marijuana is an essential part of his religious practice.  In order to 
succeed, the defendant must prove both that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic 
Church is a religion within the meaning of the first amendment and that the 
statutes in question do not serve a compelling governmental interest.

  The defendant argues that the strict daily regimen of the Coptic 
community in Jamaica and its focus on prayer services in which marijuana is 
an essential element conclusively demonstrate that the Ethiopian Zion 
Coptic Church is a religion within the protections of the first amendment.  
Assuming without deciding that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a 
religion within the amendment's protections, [Footnote 2.  Although we 
express no view as to whether the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a 
religion for purposes of first amendment analysis, we note that other 
courts have held that any belief that is "arguably religious" is generally 
accorded protection, provided that the adherent is sincere in his belief 
and acts upon this belief in good faith.  <I>Compare</I> <I>International Soc'y for 
Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Barber</I>, 650 F.2d 430 (2d Cir. 1981) with 
<I>United States v. Kuch</I>, 288 F. Supp. 439 (D.D.C. 1968).] we hold that any 
interest of the defendant protected by the free exercise clause is 
outweighed by the compelling governmental interest in regulating and 
controlling the use of marijuana and its distribution in the United States.  
The free exercise clause "embraces two concepts, - freedom to believe and 
freedom to act.  The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the 
second cannot be.  Conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection 
of society."  <I>Cantwell v. Connecticut</I>, 310 U.S. 296, 303-04 (1940).  The 
Supreme Court has emphasized on numerous occasions that actions and 
practices are not absolutely protected from governmental regulation merely 
because the actor classifies these actions as "religious."  <I>See</I>, <I>e.g.</I>, 
<I>United States v. Lee</I>, 455 U.S. 252 (1982) (social security taxes may be 
constitutionally imposed on persons who object on religious grounds to the 
payment of taxes to support public insurance funds); <I>Davis v. Beason</I>, 133 
U.S. 333 (1890); <I>Reynolds v. United States</I>, 98 U.S. 145 (1878).

  In <I>Wisconsin v. Yoder</I>, 406 U.S. 205 (1972), the Supreme Court reversed 
the conviction of an Amish farmer who had been convicted of violating 
Wisconsin's compulsory school attendance law.  The Court recognized the 
interest of the state regarding basic education, but held that the state 
interest is "not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on 
fundamental rights and interests, such as those specifically protected by 
the free exercise clause of the first amendment ...."  <I>Id</I>. at 214.  "The 
essence of all that has been said and written on the subject is that only 
those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can 
overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion."  <I>Id</I>. at 
215.  The Court examined the Amish's interest in maintaining its community 
structure and the state's interests in preparing citizens for effective and 
intelligent participation in society.  The Court then concluded that the 
state interests would not be sufficiently advanced by requiring Amish 
school children, who were enrolled until the completion of a basic 
education, to attend school for an additional two years.  <I>Id</I>. at 222. 
[Footnote 3.  [T]he value of all education must be assessed in terms of its 
capacity to prepare the child for life.  It is one thing to say that 
compulsory education for a year or two beyond the eighth grade may be 
necessary when its goal is the preparation of the child for life in modern 
society as the majority live, but it is quite another if the goal of 
education be viewed as the preparation of the child for life in the 
separated agrarian community that is the keystone of the Amish faith.  <I>Id</I>.] 
Middleton urges that the court analogize between the structure of the Amish 
and Coptic communities and that <I>Yoder</I> therefore should control our 
disposition of the case at bar.  However, even if we assume that such an 
analogy is proper (a contention upon which the court expresses no opinion), 
we find a difference in the nature of the governmental interests involved 
in the two cases.  Unlike the state interest advanced in <I>Yoder</I>, the 
interest advanced by the government in the case at bar is compelling and 
would be substantially harmed by a decision allowing members of the 
Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church to possess marijuana freely.  Congress has 
strongly and clearly expressed its intent to protect the public from the 
obvious danger of drugs and drug traffic.  <I>See</I> 21 U.S.C.  801(2) (1976).  
Unquestionably, Congress can constitutionally control the use of drugs that 
it determines to be dangerous, even if those drugs are to be used for 
religious purposes.  <I>United States v. Hudson</I>, 431 F.2d 468, 469 (5th Cir. 
1970), <I>cert. denied</I>, 400 U.S. 1011 (1971) ("the use of drugs as part of 
religious practice is not constitutionally privileged"); <I>Native American 
Church of New York v. United States</I>, 468 F. Supp. 1247 (S.D.N.Y. 1979), 
<I>aff'd</I>, 633 F.2d 205 (2d Cir. 1980); <I>Randall v. Wyrick</I>, 441 F. Supp. 312 
{W.D. Mo. 1977); <I>United States v. Kuch</I>, 288 F. Supp. 439 (D.D.C. 1968).

  Extended to its logical conclusion, appellant's argument would protect 
all drugs, not just marijuana, if any religious group chose to use them as 
a religious sacrament.  As this court noted in <I>Leary v. United States</I>, 383 
F.2d 851 (5th Cir. 1967), <I>rev'd on other grounds</I>, 395 U.S. 6 (1969), both 
the fact of legislation and the severity of the penalties provided in 
statutes such as the one in question, clearly evidence "the grave concern 
of Congress" in controlling the use of drugs.  <I>Id</I>. at 859.  Moreover, the 
harm of the particular drug in question is not relevant in determining the 
degree of protection afforded by the free exercise clause to the 
defendant's actions.

  Congress had demonstrated beyond doubt that it believes that marihuana is
  an evil in American society and a serious threat to its people.  It would
  be difficult to imagine the harm which would result if the criminal
  statutes against marihuana were nullified as to those who claim the right
  to possess and traffic in this drug for religious purposes.  For all
  practical purposes the anti-marihuana laws would be meaningless, and
  enforcement impossible.  The danger is too great, especially to the youth
  of the nation ... for this court to yield to the argument that the use of
  marihuana for so-called religious purposes should be permitted under the
  Free Exercise Clause.  We will not, therefore, subscribe to the dangerous
  doctrine that the free exercise of religion accords an unlimited freedom
  to violate the laws of the land relative to marihuana.

<I>Id</I>. at 860-61.  We cannot agree that the free exercise clause embodies the 
type of protection urged by the defendant in view of the clearly 
articulated and compelling governmental interests in regulating the 
possession and distribution of drugs.

  In support of his argument, Middleton analogizes to various state court 
decisions which have held that the use of peyote by the Native American 
Church is constitutionally protected.  This Court, however, remains bound 
by the <I>Leary</I> precedent and is not bound by these state court decisions.

  In view of all of these factors, this court cannot agree with the 
defendant's argument that his possession of marijuana is constitutionally 
protected under the first amendment.

<I>United States v. Rush</I>, 738 F.2d 497, 511-513 (1st Cir. 1984)

<B>III. FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE AND EQUAL PROTECTION</B>

  Appellants claim that they were denied the opportunity to assert a valid, 
legally sufficient defense based on the free exercise clause of the first 
amendment. [Footnote 29.  "Congress shall make no law ... prohibiting the 
free exercise [of religion) ...."  U.S. Const. amend. I.]  For purposes of 
this case the government stipulated to the following facts, which we 
assume, without deciding, are true:

  1) that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a religion embracing beliefs
  which are protected by the First Amendment; 2) that the use of marijuana
  is an integral part of the religious practice of the Church; and 3) that
  [all of the defendants] are members of the Church and sincerely embrace
  the beliefs of the Church.

On November 23, 1982, the district court ruled as a matter of law that the 
first amendment did not protect the possession of marijuana with intent to 
distribute by the defendants, and further ordered that the defendants be 
precluded from introducing at trial any evidence concerning the Ethiopian 
Zion Coptic Church and the use of marijuana by its members, insofar as such 
evidence related to their alleged first amendment defense. [Footnote 30.  
The ruling was carefully tailored to exclude evidence only in relation to 
the first amendment defense; at trial, two defense witnesses were permitted 
to testify as to the quantity and methods of marijuana consumption by 
Church members in support of the <I>Swiderski</I> defense discussed in part IV.]

  It is well established that the absolute constitutional protection 
afforded freedom of religious belief does not extend without qualification 
to religious conduct.  <I>Braunfield v. Brown</I>, 366 U.S. 599, 603 (1961); 
<I>Cantwell v. Connecticut</I>, 310 U.S. 296 (1940).  When a law is challenged as 
interfering with religious conduct, the constitutional inquiry involves 
three questions: (a) whether the challenged law interferes with free 
exercise of a religion; (b) whether the challenged law is essential to 
accomplish an overriding governmental objective; and (c) whether 
accommodating the religious practice would unduly interfere with 
fulfillment of the governmental interest.  <I>See</I> <I>United States v. Lee</I>, 455 
U.S. 252, 256-59 (1982).

  In light of the government's stipulations, the first limb of the Lee 
standard is clearly met; there is no question that marijuana use is an 
integral part of the religious doctrine and practice of the Ethiopian Zion 
Coptic Church, and that appellants are sincere practicing members of that 
Church.  The conflict with the criminal sanctions against possession of 
marijuana with intent to distribute is self-evident.

  The question whether the government has an overriding interest in 
controlling the use and distribution of marijuana by private citizens is a 
topic of continuing political controversy.  Much evidence has been adduced 
from which it might rationally be inferred that marijuana constitutes a 
health hazard and a threat to social welfare; on the other hand, proponents 
of free marijuana use have attempted to demonstrate that it is quite 
harmless.  <I>See</I> <I>Randall v. Wyrick</I>, 441 F. Supp. 312, 315-16 (W.D. Mo. 1977); 
<I>United States v. Kuch</I>, 288 F. Supp. 439, 446 & 448 (D.D.C. 1968).  In 
enacting substantial criminal penalties for possession with intent to 
distribute, Congress has weighed the evidence and reached a conclusion 
which it is not this court's task to review de novo.  Every federal court 
that has considered the matter, so far as we are aware, has accepted the 
congressional determination that marijuana in fact poses a real threat to 
individual health and social welfare, and has upheld the criminal sanctions 
for possession and distribution of marijuana even where such sanctions 
infringe on the free exercise of religion.  <I><A HREF="cir-11th.html"> United States v. Middleton</A></I>, 690 
F.2d 820, 825 (11th Cir. 1982), <I>cert. denied</I>, 460 U.S. 1051 (1983); <I>United 
States v. Spears</I>, 443 F.2d 895 (5th Cir. 1971), <I>cert. denied</I>, 404 U.S. 1020 
(1972); <I>Leary v. United States</I>, 383 F.2d 851, 859-61 (5th Cir. 1967), <I>rev'd 
on other grounds</I> 395 U.S. 6 (1969); <I>Randall</I>, 441 F. Supp. at 316 & n. 2; 
<I>Kuch</I>, 288 F. Supp. at 448.  Only last year, the Eleventh Circuit rejected 
identical claims raised by some of the very appellants before us in this 
case, <I>see</I> <I><A HREF="cir-11th.html">Middleton</A></I>, 690 F.2d 820, and the United States Supreme Court 
denied review.  We decline to second-guess the unanimous precedent 
establishing an overriding governmental interest in regulating marijuana.

  Finally, it has been recognized since Leary that accomodation of 
religious freedom is practically impossible with respect to the marijuana 
laws:

    Congress has demonstrated beyond doubt that it believes marihuana is an
  evil in American society and a serious threat to its people.  It would be
  difficult to imagine the harm which would result if the criminal
  sanctions against marihuana were nullified as to those who claim the
  right to possess and traffic in this drug for religious purposes.  For
  all practical purposes the anti-marihuana laws would be meaningless, and
  enforcement impossible.

<I>Leary</I>,383 F.2d at 861, <I>quoted in</I> <I><A HREF="cir-11th.html">Middleton</A></I>, 690 F.2d at 825; <I>see also</I> <I>Kuch</I>, 
288 F. Supp. at 447.  Although a narrow administrative exception has been 
carved out from the Schedule I classification of peyote for the benefit of 
the Native American Church, <I>see</I> 21 C.F.R.  1307.31, we think this 
exemption is properly viewed as a government "effort toward accommodation" 
for a "readily identifiable, narrow catagory" which has minimal impact on 
the enforcement of the laws in question.  <I>Lee</I>, 455 U.S. at 260 n. 11 & 261.  
No broad religious exemption from the marijuana laws is constitutionally 
required.  We therefore affirm the district court's ruling rejecting 
appellants' first amendment defense as a matter of law.

  We reject as well appellants' claim that members of the Ethiopian Zion 
Coptic Church are entitled as a matter of equal protection to a religious 
exemption from the marijuana laws on the same terms as the peyote exemption 
granted the Native American Church.  Marijuana is not covered by the peyote 
exemption; this in itself distinguishes this case from <I>Kennedy v. Bureau of 
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs</I>, 459 F.2d 415 (9th Cir, 1972), <I>cert. denied</I>, 
409 U.S. 1115 (1973).  Moreover, the peyote exemption is uniquely supported 
by the legislative history and congressional findings underlying the 
American Indian Religious Freedom Act, which declares a federal policy of 
"protecting] and preserv[ing] for American Indians their inherent right of 
freedom to believe, express and exercise the[ir] traditional religions 
including but not limited to access to sites, use and possession of sacred 
objects, and the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional 
rites."  42 U.S.C.  1996.  The legislative history of the Act "is clear in 
finding that religion is an integral part of Indian culture and that the 
use of such items as peyote are necessary to the survival of Indian 
religion and culture."  <I>Peyote Way Church of God, Inc. v. Smith</I>, 556 F. 
Supp. 632, 637 (N.D. Tex. 1983).  In light of the sui generis legal status 
of American Indians, <I>see</I> <I>Cherokee Nation v. Georgia</I>, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 1, 
16-17 (1831) (Marshall, C.J.), and the express policy of the American 
Indian Religious Freedom Act (which was passed after <I>Kennedy</I> was decided), 
we think the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church cannot be deemed similarly 
situated to the Native American Church for equal protection purposes.

<I>State v. Olsen</I>, No. 171-69079 (Iowa, July 18, 1984), slip op

  Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Muscatine County, R. K. Stohr, 
Judge.

  Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him of unlawful possession 
of marijuana with intent to deliver, a violation of Iowa Code section 
204.401(1).  AFFIRMED.

  Carl Eric Olsen, Miami Beach, Florida, pro se.  James R. Cook of Cook 
&amp; Waters, Des Moines, on the brief.

  Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, Joseph P. Weeg, Assistant Attorney 
General, and Stephen J. Petersen, County Attorney, for appellee.

  Considered by Reynoldson, C.J., and Uhlenhopp, Larson, Schultz, and 
Wolle, JJ.

<B>PER CURIAM.

</B>  Defendant, Carl Eric Olsen, appeals from a judgment convicting him of 
unlawful possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, a violation of 
Iowa Code section 204.401(1).  This case was before us in <I>State v. Olsen</I>, 
293 N.W.2d 216 (Iowa), <I>cert. denied</I>, 449 U.S. 993 (1980), in which we 
reversed and remanded when a State's witness was permitted to testify 
beyond the scope of the minutes of testimony.  Following his conviction on 
a second trial, defendant again appeals and we affirm.

  Olsen admits that when stopped by the West Liberty police in May of 1978, 
he was transporting 129 pounds of marijuana and $10,915 in cash.  His sole 
defense is that his possession and use of marijuana are protected by the 
first amendment's guarantee of religious freedom.

  Olsen is a member and priest of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. 
Testimony at his trial revealed the bona fide nature of this religious 
organization and the sacramental use of marijuana within it.  Testimony 
also revealed church members use marijuana continuously and publicly, 
commencing at an early age.  Olsen admitted to smoking marijuana while 
driving and to using the drug a few hours before testifying in his second 
trial. Nonetheless, he asks us on this appeal to afford his religious use 
of marijuana unlimited constitutional protection.

  I.  This court dealt at length with Olsen's first amendment claim in 
<I>State v. Olsen</I>, 315 N.W.2d 1, 7-9 (Iowa 1982), a case involving this 
defendant but based on a different automobile stop and arrest.  We find no 
reason to retreat from our holding there that "[a] compelling state 
interest sufficient to override Olsen's free exercise clause argument is 
demonstrated in this case."  In fact, since our last <I>Olsen</I> decision, we 
have been joined in our analysis by yet another court, see <I>Whyte v. United 
States</I>, 471 A.2d 1018 (D.C. 1984).

  Olsen now contends we must make an independent finding of a compelling 
state interest rather than defer to the legislature's decision to regulate 
marijuana.  The cases do not support Olsen's assertion.  <I>See</I> <I>Leary v. 
United States</I>, 383 F.2d 851, 860-61 (5th Cir. 1967), <I>rev'd on other 
grounds</I>, 395 U.S. 6 (1969); <I>Whyte</I>, 471 A.2d at 1021; <I>State v. Rocheleau</I>, 
451 A.2d 1144, 1148 (Vt. 1982).

  II.  Defendant also raises an equal protection challenge, based on the 
legislative exemption granted the peyote ceremonies of the Native American 
Church.  <I>See</I> Iowa Code  204.204(8) (1983).  This statutory exemption may
be derived from the California Supreme Court's decision in <I>People v.
Woody</I>, 394 P.2d 813 (Cal. 1964).  The <I>Woody</I> court noted in granting the 
prosecution exemption that peyote was use only in a desert enclosure and 
only during a special Saturday sundown to Sunday sunrise ceremony.  The 
participants were fed breakfast at the close of the ceremony and were kept 
isolated from the general population until the drug's effects had 
dissipated.  Defendant can point to no such safeguards in the Coptic 
Church's indiscriminate use of marijuana; the drug is smoked publicly and 
continuously and made available to church members regardless of age or 
occupation.  These significant distinctions render meritless defendant's 
equal protection argument.

  We affirm the judgment of the district court.

<p> 
<pre> 
                           Argued Feb. 7, 1989. 
                          Decided June 20, 1989. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     Appea1 was taken from order of the, United States District Court for  
the District of Columbia, Norma Holloway Johnson, J., which upheld denial  
of religious-use exemption from federal laws proscribing marijuana.  The  
Court of Appeals, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) free  
exercise clause did not entitle church members to use marijuana, and (2)  
fact that use of peyote by members of the Native American Church had been  
exempted from proscriptions against use of that drug did not violate  
establishment clause. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     Affirmed. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     Buckley, Circuit Judge, dissented and filed an opinion. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
1. Constitutional Law 84(l) 
     Free exercise clause embraces concepts of freedom to believe and  
freedom to act; the first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the  
second cannot be.  U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
2. Constitutional Law 84(l) 
     In appraising law alleged to constrain religious conduct, court must  
consider whether law interferes with free exercise of sincere religious  
belief, whether law is essential to accomplish an overriding governmental  
objective, and whether accommodating religious conduct would unduly  
interfere with fulfillment of governmental interest.  U.S.C.A. Const.Amend.  
1. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
3. Constitutional Law 84.5(l) 
     Accommodation to sacramental use of marijuana by Ethiopian Zion Coptic  
Church is not feasible and thus not required by the First Amendment, in  
view of church teachings that marijuana is to be smoked continually all  
day.  U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
4. Constitutional Law 84.5(19) 
   Drugs and Narcotics 42 
     Drug Enforcement Agency exemption from use of peyote for religious  
services of the Native American Church did not violate establishment  
clause, even in view of denial of exemption for religious use of marijuana  
by Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, in view of the vast difference in demand  
for marijuana under the teachings of that church and demand for peyote by  
members of the Native American Church.  U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 1. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
5. Constitutional Law 84.5(l) 
     Even if it were determined that it was a violation of establishiment  
clause to allow peyote in religious services for one church but not  
marijuana in religious services for another, remedy would not necessarily  
be to allow the use of marijuana.

     RUTH BADER GINSBURG, Circuit Judge: 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     Petitioner in this case seeks a religious-use exemption from federal  
laws proscribing marijuana.  We hold that the first amendment's free  
exercise of religion guarantee does not require the requested exemption,  
and that petitioner was not denied equal protection-establishment clause  
rights by the government's refusal to accommodate his church's sacramental  
use of marijuana. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
                                     I. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     Petitioner Olsen is a member and priest of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic  
Church.  While the church is alleged to have several thousand members in  
Jamaica, it has never had more than between 100 and 200 members in the  
United States.  Olsen assets, and the government concedes for purposes of  
this case, that the church's sacrament is marijuana; under church  
teachings, marijuana is combined with tobacco and smoked "continually all  
day, through church services, through everything we do."  State v. Olsen,  
315 N.W.2d 1, 7 (Iowa 1982) (quoting Olsen's testimony).  Olsen and his  
fellows have been convicted several times in federal and state courts of  
various marijuana offenses, including importation of twenty tons of the  
drug, and first amendment challenges to these convictions have been  
uniformly rejected.  See Olsen v. Iowa, 808 F.2d 652 (8th Cir.1986); United  
States v. Rush, 738 F.2d 497 (1st Cir.1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1004,  
105 S.Ct. 1355, 84 L.Ed.2d  378 (1985); United States v. Middleton, 690  
F.2d 820 (llth Cir.1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1051, 103 S.Ct. 1497, 75  
L.Ed.2d 929 (1983); State v. Olsen, 315 N.W.2d  1 (Iowa 1982); Town v.  
State ex rel. Reno, 377 So.2d 648 (Fla.1979), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 803,  
101 S.Ct. 48, 66 L.Ed. 2d 7 (1980). 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     The federal convictions were based on the Controlled Substarces Act,  
21 U.S.C.  801-904 (1982), which lists marijuana as a "Schedule I"  
controlled substance with a "high potential for abuse."  Id.  812(b)(1)(A)  
& (c).  Between 1983 and 1985, Olsen several times petitioned the Drug  
Enforcement Administration (DEA), which administers the Act, for an  
exemption permitting his church's sacramental use of marijuana.  Olsen  
maintained that such an exemption is required by the first amendment's  
guarantee of the free exercise of religion.  He further urged, under an  
establishment clause-equal protection rubric, that his church is entitled  
to an exemption similar to that granted by federal regulation to the Native  
American Church for its sacramental'use of peyote.  See 21 C.F.R.  1307.31  
(1987). 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     In an effort to prompt a response from the DEA, Olsen unsuccessfully  
sued in the Eleventh Circuit to compel agency action.  Olsen v. DEA, 776  
F.2d 267 (llth Cir.1985) (affirming district court's dismissal of 01sen's  
complaint), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1030, 106 S.Ct. 1236, 89 L.Ed.2d 344  
(1986).  Thereafter, in January 1986, Olsen petitioned the U.S. District  
Court for the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus, and that court,  
in March 1986, directed the DEA to show cause why the writ should not  
issue.  In April 1986, in a three-paragraph letter ruling, the DEA denied  
01sen's petitions; the letter reported the DEA's conclusion that "the  
immensity of the marijuana abuse problem," and the correspondingly  
"compelling governmental interest" in controlling trafficking in and use of  
the substance, "outweighed" the church's interest in access to marijuana.   
Letter from John C. Lawn, DEA Administrator, to Carl Eric Olsen (Apr. 22,  
1986).  The district court then dismissed Olsen's mandamus petition as  
moot. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
    Olsen, acting pro se, both petitioned this court for review of the  
DEA's decision, and appealed from the district court's dismissal of his  
mandamus petition.  In February

1988, this court, on its own motion, directed appointment of members of the  
law firm of Hogan and Hartson to serve as amicus curiae "to address those  
issues raised by [Olsen] and any other issues appropriate for the court's  
consideration in this case." [footnote 1]  After amicus filed a brief, the  
DEA moved to remand the matter for renewed agency consideration.  In April  
1988, we authorized further agency proceedings and instructed the DEA to  
supplement the record and return it with a final order by July 29, 1988.   
On remand, amicus presented 01sen's proposal for a "restrictive religious  
exemption" that would include the following limitations: 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
   --Church members would be restricted 
   to using marijuana during their Saturday 
   evening prayer ceremony, which lasts 
   from 8:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m.; 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
   --During that ceremony, and for the 
   eight hours following that ceremony, 
   Church members would not leave the 
   place where the ceremony is conducted; 
   they would not drive automobiles or oth- 
   erwise go out in public; 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
   --Ingestion of marijuana would be limit- 
   ed to Church members who had reached 
   the age of majority, according to the 
   laws of the state in which the ceremony 
   takes place; 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
   --Ingestion of marijuana would be limit- 
   ed to full Church members who had un- 
   dergone the confession ritual for enter- 
   ing the Church's community....

Memorandum of Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in Support and on Behalf of  
Petitioner Carl E. Olsen at 29-30 (submitted to DEA on remand). 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     On July 29, 1988, the DEA issued its Final Order, reaffirming its  
denial of 01sen's exemption requests.  That order, which we set out in full  
as an Appendix to this opinion, first disclaimed statutory authority to  
grant the exemption.  According to the DEA, Congress intended no religious- 
use exemption from Controlled Substances Act proscriptions other than the  
peyote-use permission granted the Native American Church.  Next, the DEA as  
sumed, in order to rule completely, that it had authority to consider  
Olsen's exemption petition.  It further accepted, for purposes of its  
decision, that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a bona fide religion  
with marijuana as its sacrament.  The agency then rejected Olsen's free  
exercise claim, concluding that the government has a compelling interest in  
the regulation of controlled substances and that accommodation to religious  
use of drugs is not required.  Final Order, infra pp. 1466-1467. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     The DEA also rejected Olsen's establishment clause-equal protection  
plea, stating why, on the matter in controversy, it deemed the Ethiopian  
Zion Coptic Church not similarly situated to the Native American Church.   
Id. p. 1467.  First, Olsen's church "advocates the continuous use of  
marijuana or 'ganja', while the Native American Church's use of peyote is  
isolated to specific ceremonial occasions."  Id.  Second, the DEA reasoned:  
"[W]hile peyote and marijuana are both Schedule I controlled substances  
with a defined high potential for abuse, the actual abuse and availability  
of marijuana in the United States is many times more pervasive ... than  
that of peyote."  Id. p. 1467 (emphasis added).  Third, the DEA noted that  
Olsen was convicted in Rush for importing twenty tons of marijuana, "an  
outrageous quantity to supply [his church's] religious needs."  Id.  The  
DEA also rejected 01sen's proposal to restrict usage, saying monitoring  
compliance would be "impractical."  Id. p. 1468. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     The DEA's July 1988 Final Order is now before this court for review.

                                    II. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     The DEA initially asserted in its July 1988 Final Order that Congress  
had given

   William A. Bradford, Jr. and Steven J. Routh 
   were appointed and filed briefs in support of 
   Olsen's position, with the assistance of Emily E. 
   Moskowitz.  Mr. Routh appeared on Olsen's be- 
   half at oral argument.  The court commends 
   appointed counsel for work of excellent quality 
   and service in the best tradition of the bar. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
[footnote 2]
   Because the DEA completely responded to 01- 
   sen's exemption petition in its Final Order, we 
   hold that 01sen's petition for mandamus to 
   compel a response is now moot.

OLSEN v. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMIN.<br> 
Cite as 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1989)<p> 
<pre> 
the agency no authority to grant the exemption Olsen sought.  Apart from  
permitting legitimate medical and scientific or research use, the DEA  
maintained, Congress intended no exemption other than the one, supported in  
the legislative history of the Controlled Substances Act, for the Native  
American Church.  Final Order, infra p. 1466.  This argument did not figure  
in the DEA's original denial of Olsen's petitions; the agency's April 1986  
letter ruling, we note, responded immediately and directly to the merits of  
Olsen's request. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     The DEA's contention that Congress directed the Administrator  
automatically to turn away all churches save one opens a grave  
constitutional question.  A statutory exemption authorized for one church  
alone, and for which no other church may qualify, presents a  
"denominational preference" not easily reconciled with the establishment  
clause.  See Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 245, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 1683-84,  
72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982); cf. infra pp. 1463-1464.  We resist an interpretation  
dissonant with the "cardinal principle" that legislation should be  
construed, if "fairly possible," to avoid a constitutional confrontation.   
See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 348, 56 S.Ct. 466, 483, 80 L.Ed. 688  
(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     Furthermore, we recognize that even if the DEA were not empowered or  
obliged to act, Olsen would be entitled to a judicial audience.   
Ultimately, the Courts cannot escape the obligation to address his plea  
that the exemption he seeks is mandated by the first amendment's religion  
clauses.  See Peyote Way Church of God v. Smith, 742 F.2d 193 (5th  
Cir.1984) (upholding church's standing to seek a declaratory judgment that  
denying church access to peyote is unconstitutional).  We are aided in this  
task of judicial review by the consideration given the matter, in the first  
instance, by the expert administrator. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     In sum, for purposes of this case, we accept the position that  
Congress did not strip the DEA of authority to rule on the merits of  
Olsen's petitions, [footnote 3] and we turn to the questions whether the  
free exercise of religion clause or the equal protection principle (coupled  
with the establishment clause) commands the exemption Olsen seeks. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
                                    III. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     Olsen's free exercise claim has been raised, considered, and rejected  
in the context of criminal proceedings.  See Olsen v. Iowa, 808 F.2d at  
653; Rush, 738 F.2d at 512-13; Middleton, 690 F.2d at 824-26; State v.  
Olsen, 315 N.W.2d at 7-9; Town v. State ex rel. Reno, 377 So.2d at 650-51.   
We agree, substantially, with those dispositions, and therefore need not  
treat the issue expansively. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     [1]  It is familiar doctrine that the free exercise clause "embraces  
two concepts,-- freedom to believe and freedom to act.  The first is  
absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be.  Conduct  
remains subject to regulation for the protection of society."  Cantwell v.  
Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303-04, 60 S.Ct. 900, 903, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940).   
As the Supreme Court recently restated: 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
   [T]he Court has rejected challenges un- 
   der the Free Exercise Clause to govern- 
   mental regulation of certain overt acts 
   prompted by religious beliefs or princi- 
   ples, for "even when the action is in 
   accord with one's religious convictions, 
   [it] is not totally free from legislative 
   restrictions."  Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 
   U.S. 599, 603, 81 S.Ct. 1144, 1146, 6 L.Ed. 
   2d 563 (1961).  The conduct or actions so 
   regulated have invariably posed some 
   substantial threat to public safety, peace 
   or order.  See, e.g., Reynolds v. United 
   States, 98 U.S. 145, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1879) 
   [upholding ban on polygamy]; Jacobson 
   v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25 S.Ct. 
   358, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905) [compulsory vac- 
   cination law]; Pnnce v. Massachusetts,

</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     [2]  In appraising laws alleged to constrain religious conduct, the  
Supreme Court has instructed lower courts to consider: (a) whether the law  
interferes with the free exercise of sincere religious belief; (b) whether  
the law is essential to accomplish an overriding governmental objective;  
and (c) whether accommodating the religious conduct would unduly interfere  
with fulfillment of the governmental interest.  See United States v. Lee,  
455 U.S. 252, 256-59, 102 S.Ct. 1051, 1054-56, 71 L.Ed.2d 127 (1982); Rush,  
738 F.2d at 512.  The first two factors stated in Lee are not contested in  
this case.  The DEA, "[f]or purposes of this decision ... accepts that the  
Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a bona fide religion whose sacrament is  
marijuana."  Final Order, infra p. 1466.  And "Olsen does not dispute the  
government's compelling interest in controlling the distribution and drug-  
related use of marijuana," Brief of Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae at 18.   
Indeed, "[e]very federal court that has considered the matter, so far as we  
are aware, has accepted the congressional determination that marijuana in  
fact poses a real threat to individual health and social welfare."  Rush,  
738 F.2d at 512. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     [3]  The pivotal issue, therefore, is whether marijuana usage by Olsen  
and other members of his church can be accommodated without undue  
interference with the government's interest in controlling the drug.  Three  
circuits have so far considered pleas for religious exemption from the  
marijuana laws; each has rejected the argument that accommodation to  
sacramental use of the drug is feasible and therefore required.  Rush, 738  
F.2d at 513 (First Circuit); Olsen v. Iowa, 808 F.2d at 653 (Eighth  
Circuit); Middleton, 690 F.2d at 825 (Eleventh Circuit).  We have no reason  
to doubt that these courts have accurately gauged the Highest Court's  
pathmarks in this area. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     Olsen refers to his proposal for restrictive use, see supra p. 1460,  
and claims that this case is now differently contoured than earlier ones.   
Even if the government is not required to accommodate to the extent of  
allowing a broad religious exemption, he argues, it can and must  
accommodate to the time- and place-specific use he has proposed.  Because  
the tenets of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church endorse marijuana use every  
day throughout the day, however, Olsen's proposal for confined use would  
not be self-enforcing.  It is hardly unreasonable to forecast a large  
monitoring burden in light of evidence that in years past, the church's  
"[c]hecks on distribution of cannabis to nonbelievers in the faith [were]  
minimal," there was "easy access to cannabis for a child who had absolutely  
no interest in learning the religion," and "[m]embers [partook] of cannabis  
anywhere, not just within the confines of a church facility."  Town v.  
State ex rel. Reno, 377 So.2d at 649, 651. 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
     Critically, Olsen's proposal would require the government to make  
supplies of marijuana available to Olsen's church on a regular basis.  See  
Reply Brief of Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae at 7, 17.  We are unaware of  
any "free exercise" precedent for compelling government accommodation of  
religious practices when that accommodation requires burdensome and  
constant official supervision and management.  Cf. Wissconsin v. Yoder, 406  
U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) (religious exemption from  
compulsory school law at issue imposed no toll on the state); Sherbert v.  
Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) (payment of  
unemployment compensation to person fired for refusing to work on Saturday  
Sabbath required no administrative mechanism other than the one already in  
place); Leahy v. District of Columbia, 833 F.2d 1046, 1049 n. 6

     In sum, we conclude that the DEA cannot accommodate Olsen's religious  
use of marijuana without unduly burdening or disrupting enforcement of the  
federal marijuana laws.  We therefore hold that the free exercise clause  
does not compel the DEA to grant Olsen an exemption immunizing his church  
from prosecution for illegal use of marijuana.

     [4]  In addition to the argument that the free exercise clause  
requires government accommodation to sacramental use of marijuana by  
members of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, Olsen asserts an establishment  
clause-equal protection challenge.  He maintains that members of his church  
are entitled to a religious exemption from the marijuana laws on the same  
terms as the peyote exemption granted the Native American Church.  See 21  
C.F.R.  1307.31 ("The listing of peyote as a controlled substance in  
Schedule I does not apply to the nondrug use of peyote in bona fide  
religious ceremonies of the Native American Church, and members of the  
Native American Church so using peyote are exempt from registration.").   
Olsen has urged before that members of his church are similarly situated to  
the beneficiaries of the exemption prescribed in 21 C.F.R.  1307.31.  See  
Olsen v. Iowa, 808 F.2d at 653; Rush, 738 F.2d at 513.  We join our sister  
courts in rejecting this plea.  Indeed, had the DEA timely objected, we  
might have held the issue precluded.  See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS  
 27 (1982). [footnote 5]

     The DEA has cogently explained why a tightly-cabined exemption for  
peyote use in a religious rite need not mean that religious use of  
marijuana (or any other widely used controlled substance) must be  
accommodated: 
</pre> 
<p> 
<pre> 
   [T]he actual abuse and availability of 
   marijuana in the United States is many 
   times more pervasive ... than that of 
   peyote....  The amount of peyote seized 
   and analyzed by the DEA between 1980 
   and 1987 was 19.4 pounds.  The amount 
   of marijuana seized and analyzed by the 
   DEA between 1980 and 1987 was 15,302,- 
   468.7 pounds.  This overwhelming differ- 
   ence explains why an accommodation can 
   be made for a religious organization 
   which uses peyote in circumscribed cere- 
   monies, and not for a religion which es- 
   pouses continual use of marijuana.

   Amicus cites the permission for medical and

   that a religious accommodation can be arranged 
   without undue burden to the government.  See 
   Brief of Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae at 7-9, 
   21.  We think the tightly-drawn, closed system 
   for access to controlled substances by, or on the 
   order of, medical doctors and researchers can- 
   not tenably be compared to the permission 
   sought here.  Government may a1low use of 
   marijuana in programs to lessen the negative 
   side-effects of chemotherapy and to treat glau- 
   coma, for example, without thereby opening the 
   way to licenses for the use of marijuana by the 
   healthy.

     Amicus also cites the peyote exemption ac- 
   corded the Native American Church as afford- 
   ing "reason ... to believe that a workable ac- 
   commodation exists in this case."  Id. at 21. 
   This argument is addressed infra in the context 
   of Olsen's establishment clause-equa1 protection 
   claim.

<p>  
<pre>  
[footnote 5]
   The dissent describes Olsen as choosing "an 
   Establishment Clase battleground" in prefer- 
   ence to an equal protection one.  Dissent at 
   1468.  01sen's own petitions to the DEA, how- 
   ever, featured equal protection.  See Brief of 
   Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae at App. 7, 19 ("I 
   would like you to respond to the issue of equal 
   protection....  Why are you discriminating 
   against my religion by denying the same bene- 
   fits which are given to the sacramenta1 uses of 
   peyote and wine?").  Court-appointed amicus 
   curiae, it is true, did put the comparison with 
   the Native American Church uder an etablish- 
   ment clause heading, drawing strength from 
   the Supreme Court's characterization in Larson 
   v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 72 
   L.Ed.2d 33 (1982). 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     We do not believe the label consequential.  As 
   court-appointed amicus recognized, in cases of 
   this character, establishment clause and equal 
   protection analysis converge.  See Walz v. Tax 
   Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664, 694, 696, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 
   1425, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) (Opinion of Harlan,

peyote on the other warranted the DEA's response to Olsen's petition.  Were  
the DEA to consider a marijuana exemption, equal protection (and/or the  
establishment clause, see supra note 5) would indeed appear to command that  
it do so evenhandedly.  See Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 102 S.Ct.  
1673, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982); cf. Kennedy v. Bureau of Narcotics and  
Dangerous Drugs, 459 F.2d 415 (9th Cir. 1972) (petitioning church not  
entitled to peyote-use exemption that leaves nonexempt other churches that  
use peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1115,  
93 S.Ct. 901, 34 L.Ed. 2d 699 (1973).  The DEA would have no warrant to  
contain the exemption to a single church or religion.  See, e.g., Randall  
v. Wyrick, 441 F.Supp. 312 (W.D.Mo.1977) (Aquarian Brotherhood Church);  
Whyte v. United States, 471 A.2d 1018, 1020 (D.C.1984) (Rastafarians);   
State v. Rocheleau, 142 Vt. 61, 451 A.2d 1144, 1148-49 (1982)  
(practitioners of Tantric Buddhism). 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     [5]  Even if we were to credit Olsen's equal protection argument or  
the dissent's portrayal of it in terms of the establishment clause, the  
remedy Olsen requests hardly follows.  Faced with the choice between  
invalidation and extension of any controlled-substances religious  
exemption, which would the political branches choose?  It would take a  
court bolder than this one to predict, as our dissenting colleague appears  
to suggest, that extension, not invalidation, would be the probable choice.   
Compare Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. 76, 89-93, 99 S.Ct. 2655, 2663-65,  
61 L.Ed. 2d 382 (1979) (majority opinion) with id. at 94-96 (Powell, J.,  
dissenting).  See generally Miller, Constitutional Remedies for Under-

<p>  
<pre>  
     While we rest our decision on the immensity of the marijuana control  
problem in the United States, we note some further distinctions.  The  
peyote exemption was accorded to the Native American Church for a  
traditional, precisely circumscribed ritual.  In that ritual, the peyote  
itself is an object of worship; for members of the Native American Church,  
use of peyote outside the ritual is sacrilegious.  See People v. Woody, 61  
Cal.2d 716, 40 Cal Rptr. 69, 73, 394 P.2d 813, 817 (1964).  Thus the  
church, for all purposes other than the special, stylized ceremony,  
reinforced the state's prohibition.  In contrast, the Ethiopian Zion Coptic  
Church, as earlier observed, teaches that marijuana is properly smoked  
"continually all day," as Olsen himself stated, "through everything that we  
do."  State v. Olsen, 315 N.W.2d at 7; see also Town v. State ex rel. Reno,  
377 So.2d at 649.  True, for purposes of the exemption requested, Olsen  
narrowed the permission he sought to track the one accorded the Native  
American Church.  See Memorandum of Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in  
Support and on Behalf of Petitioner Carl E. Olsen at 29-30 (submitted to  
DEA on remand).  But "narrow" use, concededly, is not his religion's  
tradition. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     We mention too--but express no opinion concerning--the view of the  
First Circuit that the peyote exemption is bound up with the federal policy  
of preserving Native American culture, and thus can be comprehended  
properly only "[i]n light of the sui generis legal status of American  
Indians."  Rush, 738 F.2d at 513; accord Peyote Way Church of God v. Meese,  
698 F.Supp. 1342, 1346-49 (N.D.Tex.1988) (Native American Church is "the  
only one of its own kind" and exemption afforded it since 1965 "cannot be  
expanded to include non-Native American Church use of peyote"), appeal  
filed, Dec. 22, 1988; United States v. Warner, 595 F.Supp. 595, 600-01  
(D.N.D.1984) (exemption for Native American Church is tied to fulfillment  
of "government's unique obligation" to preserve Indian culture).  Contra

<p>  
<pre>  
     This order is issued pursuant to an Order from the United States Court  
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which remanded the matter  
of a petition from Carl Eric Olsen on behalf of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic  
Church to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in order to construct a  
complete record for review. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     On April 22, 1986, the Administrator of DEA denied Mr. Olsen's request  
for an exemption from the Controlled Substances Act for use of marijuana  
for religious purposes by the, Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  Mr. Olsen  
petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
Circuit for review of the Administrator's denial.  The Court remanded the  
matter to the DEA for further findings and a more complete record for  
review.  Pursuant to the Court's Order, agency counsel requested Mr. Olsen  
and the law firm of Hogan & Hartson, appointed amicus curiae by the Court,  
to present any documents, evidence or arguments which they wished the  
Administrator to consider in rendering a final decision. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     Hogan & Hartson submitted a Memorandum of Law with attachments.   
Counsel for DEA has also provided the Administrator with a Memorandum of  
Law and attached documents.  The Administrator has considered the evidence  
before him, and hereby renders a final decision.

     In his petition for exemption to use of marijuana for religious  
purposes, Mr. Olsen requests an exemption similar to that granted to the  
Native Arnerlcan Church for use of peyote in bona fide religious  
ceremonies.  This exemption is found in Title 21, Code of Federal  
Regulations, Section 1307.31.  Mr. Olsen cites Constitutional principles  
relating to the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and Equal  
Protection as the basis for his request.  He also out-

   Several state courts have held that the free

lines the history of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church and its use of  
marijuana as a sacrament.  For the reasons that follow, Mr. Olsen's request  
is denied. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The Administrator finds that he does not have the authority to grant  
the exemption requested by Mr. Olsen.  The Administrator's authority to  
conduct rulemaking and to make waivers to regulatory and statutory  
provisions of the Controlled Substances Act is specifically circumscribed  
by that Act.  The Controlled Substances Act contemplates legitimate  
manufacturing, distribution and use of controlled substances for medical,  
scientific and research purposes. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The Controlled Substances Act provides that all persons who desire to  
manufacture, distribute or dispense controlled substances must obtain a  
registration to do so.  The Attornev General is authorized to waive the  
requirement of registration if he finds that it is in the public interest.   
The terms manufacture, distribute and dispense are defined in the  
Controlled Substances Act and contemplate activity involving medical and  
scientific use of controlled substances.  Neither manufacturing,  
distribution or dispensing contemplates the possession of controlled  
substances for other than legitimate medical or research purposes. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The Administrator does not have inherent authority to make exemptions  
to the statute.  In granting the exemption for the Native American Church,  
the Director of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) relied  
upon the intentions of Congress in the legislative history of the  
Controlled Substances Act for his ailthority. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The courts have found that the Administrator has authority to schedule  
substances under the Controlled Substances Act.  This authority was granted  
to the Attorney General by Congress with specific criteria and procedural  
requirements for scheduling.  The authority was subsequently delegated to  
the Administrator by the Attorney General as provided by the Act.  See: 21  
U.S.C.  871(a).  The criminal sanctions of the Act are dependent upon a  
substance being scheduled, and into which schedule it is placed.  The  
criteria for scheduling do not include provisions for religious use.  There  
is no mechanism for an exemption to scheduling for religious purposes.  The  
courts have closely reviewed the Administrator's scheduling of substances,  
and have recently held that he did not have the authority to temporarily  
schedule a substance without a specific delegation from the Attorney  
General.  If the courts refuse to expand the Administrator's authority  
under the Act to permit temporary scheduling which imposes criminal  
sanctions, it is expected they would refuse to expand the Administrators  
authority to waive those same criminal sanctions without specific 
authorization. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     Because of the possibility that the United States Court of Appeals for  
the District of Columbia may find that the Administrator does have the  
authority to grant a religious exemption to the provisions of the  
Controlled Substances Act, the Administrator will also address the issue of  
whether the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church should be granted an exemption for  
the use of marijuana for religious purposes. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     In the Memorandum of Law filed on behalf of Mr. Olsen in this matter,  
Mr. Olsen represents that he has been denied basic procedural due process  
because no hearing has been held.  Where there is no issue of fact to be  
decided, and no statutory requirement for a hearing, a hearing is not  
necessary.  For purposes of this decision, the Administrator accepts that  
the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a bona fide religion whose sacrament is  
marijuana.  The Administrator also accepts Mr. Olsen's representations of  
the method and manner of use of marijuana by members of the church.  The  
acceptance of these facts means there are no facts in dispute, and,  
therefore, no necessity for a hearing. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The Administrator finds that the federal courts that have interpreted  
the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution have  
held that an individual's religious practices may be curtailed by  
government statute or requirement if the government can show that its  
action serves a compelling state interest.  See: Bowen v.

Roy, 476 U.S. 693 (1986); Unlited States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252 (1982).  The  
government must make a reasonable effort to accommodate the religious  
practice, but it is not always possible to make such accommodation, nor is  
it Constitutionally required.  The lower courts have found, in cases where  
religious practices were raised as a defense to criminal drug charges, that  
the government has a compelling state interest in the regulation of  
controlled substances and that accommodation is not usually possible.  The  
cases addressing the religious use of marijuana are consistent in finding  
that the Free Exercise Clause does not require the government to permit  
religious use of controlled substances.  Beginning with Leary v. United  
States, 383 F.2d 851 (5th Cir.1967), rev'd on other grounds, 395 U.S. 6  
(1969), the federal appellate courts have found that the government has a  
compelling interest in controlling marijuana use.  See: United States v.  
Spears, 443 F.2d 895 (5th Cir.1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1020 (1972);  
United States v. Middleton, 690 F.2d 820 (llth Cir.1982), cert. denied, 460  
U.S. 1051 (1983); United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d 497 (1st Cir.1984), cert.  
denied, 471 U.S. 1120 (1985) and Olsen v. State of Iowa, 808 F.2d 652 (8th  
Cir.1986).  It should be noted that the Petitioner in this matter, Mr.  
Olsen, was an appellant in both the Rush and Olsen cases, in which he  
raised his religious use of marijuana in defense of criminal charges  
involving possession and trafficking in marijuana.  The Middleton case  
involved a defendant who was a member of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic 
Church. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     While Mr. Olsen maintains that these cases are not relevant to the  
Administrator's decision because they involve the defense of a criminal  
charge, the Administrator finds that they are indeed relevant in that the  
courts discuss the very Constitutional issues which must be addressed in  
this matter.  In addition to finding that the members of these religions  
had no Free Exercise guarantee to use controlled substances for religious  
purposes, the courts also found that as a matter of equal protection, these  
individuals' religions were not entitled to the same exemption as that  
given by DEA to the Native American Church for use of peyote for bona fide  
religious purposes.  In finding that members of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic  
Church are not entitled to the same exemption as the Native American  
Church, the courts have made a distinction between the practices of the  
Native American Church and other churches, and the court in Rush stated,  
"we think the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church cannot be deemed similarly  
situated to the Native American Church for equal protection purposes."   
United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d 497, 513 (1st Cir.1984), cert. denied, 471  
U.S. 1120 (1985).  The Administrator finds that there is indeed a  
distinction between the practices of the Native American Church and the  
Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  Mr. Olsen has stated that the Ethiopian Zion  
Coptic Church advocates the continuous use of marijuana or "ganja", while  
the Native American Church's use of peyote is isolated to specific  
ceremonial occasions. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     In addition, the Administrator finds that while peyote and marijuana  
are both Schedule I controlled substances with a defined high potential for  
abuse, the actual abuse and availability of marijuana in the United States  
is many times more pervasive in American society than that of peyote.  The  
statistics of DEA confirm this conclusion.  The amount of peyote seized and  
analyzed by the DEA between 1980 and 1987 was 19.4 pounds.  The amount of  
marijuana seized and analyzed by the DEA between 1980 and 1987 was  
15,302,468.7 pounds.  This overwhelming difference explains why an  
accommodation can be made for a religious organization which uses peyote in  
circumscribed ceremonies, and not for a religion which espouses continual  
use of marijuana.  The Administrator also notes that Mr. Olsen's conviction  
in United States v. Rush involved the illegal importation of 20 tons of  
marijuana.  Mr. Olsen and the other 19 defendants all claimed to be members  
of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church and raised the religious use of  
marijuana as a defense to criminal charges.  If Mr. Olsen's assertions that  
the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church in the United States has

never had, "more than between 100 and 200 members in this country,"  
(Petitioner's Memorandum at page 11), 20 tons of marijuana would be an  
outrageous quantity to supply their religious needs. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     Mr. Olsen submits that his church will submit to a reasonable  
accommodation to their use of marijuana, limiting its ingestion to specific  
days and specific time periods, Given the large amounts of marijuana  
available in this country, and the difficulty the DEA would have in trying  
to monitor compliance which [sic] such a requirement, the Administrator  
finds that accommodation is impractical.  The public interest dictates that  
the exemption granted for religious use of peyote to the Native American  
Church should not be expanded to include marijuana for the Ethiopian Zion  
Coptic Church, or any other religion. 
</pre>  
<p>

     Based upon the record in this proceeding, the legal precedents, and  
for the reasons outlined, the Petition by Carl Eric Olsen submitted on  
behalf of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church for an exemption to the  
Controlled Substances Act to use marijuana for religious purposes, is  
hereby denied.

     BUCKLEY, Circuit Judge, dissenting: 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     I dissent because the majority fails to address the Establishment  
Clause implications of the Drug Enforcement Agency's rejection of Olsen's  
request for a limited religious exemption.  That denial creates a clear-cut  
denominational preference in favor of the Native American Church, which has  
been granted such an exemption.  As the agency has not adequately explained  
why the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church must not be accorded comparable  
treatment, I would grant Olsen's petition for review on the Establishment  
Clause claim and remand to the agency. 
</pre>  
<p>

                                     I. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The majority treats Olsen's denominational preference claim as an  
equal protection challenge rather than as one involving the Establishment  
Clause.  Majority Opinion ("Maj. op.") at 1463-65.  While the Supreme    
Court has at times discussed the principle of neutrality among religions in  
terms of equal protection rights, see, e.g., Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345  
U.S. 67, 70, 73 S.Ct. 526, 527, 97 L.Ed. 828 (1953) (Frankfurter, J.,  
concurring), Olsen's choice of an Establishment Clause battleground is  
consistent both with the facts of this case and with the Supreme Court's  
more recent precedent that applies the Establishment Clause to  
denominational preferences (see Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 et  
seq., 102 S.Ct. 1673, 1683 et. seq., 72 L.Ed. 2d 33 (1982)).

                                    II. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     Although certain aspects of the Supreme Court's Establishment Clause  
jurisprudence are complex, the doctrine applicable in this particular case  
is straightforward.  "The clearest command of the Establishment Clause is  
that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over  
another."  Id. at 244, 102 S.Ct. at 1683; see also Everson v. Board of  
Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 15, 67 S.Ct. 504, 511, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947) ("The  
'establishment of religion' clause ... means at least this: Neither a state  
nor the Federal Government can set up a church.  Neither can pass laws  
which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over  
another.").  When we are presented with government action "granting a  
denominational preference, our precedents demand that we treat the law as  
suspect and that we apply strict scrutiny in adjudging its   
constitutionality."  Larson, 456 U.S. at 246, 102 S.Ct. at 1684. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     In the instant case, the DEA has permitted the Native American Church  
to make sacramental use of a drug listed as a Schedule I controlled  
substance under the Controlled Substances Act, but denied the Ethiopian  
Zion Coptic Church a similar accommodation.  This denominational preference  
constitutes a violation of the Establishment Clause unless the DEA is able  
to demonstrate that "it is justified by a compelling governmental interest  
... and ...

is closely fitted to further that interest."  Larson, 456 U.S. at 247, 102 
S.Ct. at 1685. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The DEA asserts that it does not have the inherent authority to grant 
exemptions, and that "[i]n granting the exemption for the Native American 
Church, the [DEA's predecessor] relied upon the intentions of Congress in 
the Controlled Substances Act for its authority." [footnote *]  In the 
Matter of Petition of Carl E. Olsen for the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, 
Final Order (July 26, 1988) ("Final Order"), supra at 1466.  On appeal, the 
agency also implies, DEA Brief at 24, that the Native American Church is to 
be distinguished not on the basis of its religious character, but on "the 
sui generis legal status of American Indians" (quoting United States v. 
Rush, 738 F.2d 497, 513 (lst Cir.1984)). 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     Neither explanation is relevant.  Whatever the DEA's authority to 
grant exemptions,  it has in fact granted one to the Native American 
Church.  Furthermore, that Church's status as an indigenous faith does not 
affect its religious character.  As the Department of Justice's Office of 
Legal Counsel wrote when reviewing the Native American Church's exemption: 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
   [T]he special treatment of Indians under 
   our law does not stem from the unique 
   features of Indian religion or culture. 
   With respect to these matters, Indians 
   stand on no different footing than do 
   other minorities in our pluralistic society. 
   Rather, the special treatment of Indians 
   is grounded in their unique status as 
   political entities, formerly sovereign na- 
   tions preexisting the Constitution, which 
   still retain a measure of inherent sover- 
   eignty over their peoples unless divested 
   by federal statute or by necessary impli- 
   cation of their dependent status.  See 
   United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 
   98 S.Ct. 1079, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978). 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
      An exemption for Indian religious use 
   of peyote would not be grounded in the 
   unique political status of Indians.  In- 
   stead, the exemption would be based on 
   the special culture and religion of the 
   Indians.  In this respect, Indian religion 
   cannot be treated differently than other 
   religions similarly situated without viola- 
   tion of the Establishment Clause.

     As the United States Government unquestionably has granted the Native 
American Church an accommodation that it has declined to extend to the 
Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, it has the burden of demonstrating that its 
action was required by its paramount responsibility for the control of 
drugs.   I submit that the DEA's' explanation in its Final Order falls far 
short of meeting Larson's strict scrutiny standard.

   It is by no means certain that the present exemp- 
   tion has its origin in a congressional mandate 
   rather than in an agency determination that it 
   was constitutionally required.  As the DEA 
   notes in its brief, DEA Brief at 4-5 n. 4, the first 
   regulation exempting the Native American 
   Church's use of peyote was issued following the 
   enactment of the Drug Abuse Contro1 Amend- 
   ments of 1965.  Shortly before final House ac- 
   tion on the bill, the Chairman of the House 
   Committee on Interstate and Foreign Com- 
   merce, Congressman Harris, introduced a letter 
   from the Food and Drug Administration (the 
   agency then concerned with drug enforcement) 
   in support of his recommendation that his col- 
   leagues accept a Senate amendment striking a 
   House provision exempting the sacramental use 
   of peyote.  The letter contains the following 
   statement: 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     If the church is a bona fide religious organiza- 
     tion that makes sacramental use of peyote, 
     then it would be our view that H.R. 2, even 
     without the peyote exemption which appeared 
     in the House-passed version, could not forbid 
     bona fide religious use of peyote.  We believe 
     that the constitutional guarantee of religious 
     freedom fully safeguards the rights of the 
     organization and its communicants.

Zion Coptic Church.  The first turns on differences between the practices 
of the two churches as they relate to the use of peyote and marijuana; the 
second hinges on the differences in the law enforcement problems posed by 
the two drugs. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The first distinction is addressed in a single sentence: "Mr. Olsen 
has stated that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church advocates the continuous 
use of marijuana or 'ganja', while the Native American Church's use of 
peyote is isolated to specific ceremonial occasions."  Final Order, supra 
at 1467.  The problem with this statement is that it wholly ignores the 
stringent restrictions on the members' sacramental use of marijuana that 
would be imposed by the terms of the limited religious exemption requested 
by Olsen.  See Maj. op. at 1460.  The DEA later acknowledges that Olsen has 
proposed limiting the use of marijuana "to specific days and specific time 
periods," but dismisses the proposal because of "the large amounts of 
marijuana available in this Country, and the difficulty the DEA would have 
in trying to monitor compliance" with the stipulated restrictions.  Final 
Order, supra at 1468.  Without more, I find this explanation utterly 
unsatisfactory as any member of the Church found in possession of the drug 
outside the limited hours and place set aside for its ceremonial use would 
not be shielded by the exemption. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     Moreover, the restrictions proposed by Olsen, which are similar to 
those imposed by the Native American Church on the sacramental use of 
peyote, clearly distinguish this case from those cited by the DEA (id. at 
1467-68) and the majority (Maj. op. at 1463) to show that other circuits 
have rejected comparable claims advanced on behalf of the Ethiopian Zion 
Coptic Church.  None of those cases involved the facts now before us: the 
denial of a request for a limited, prospective exemption from the 
Controlled Substances Act that the government had already granted another 
denomination. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The second distinction made by the DEA, and the one that the majority 
finds compelling, is the dramatic disparity between our society's abuse of 
the two substances as illustrated by the fact that 19.4 pounds of peyote 
were seized by the DEA between 1980---and 1987 in contrast to the 
15,302,468.7 pounds of marijuana seized during the same period.  Final 
Order, supra at 1467.  "This overwhelming difference," the DEA asserts, 
"explains why an accommodation can be made for a religious organization 
which uses peyote in circumscribed ceremonies, and not for a religion which 
espouses continual use of marijuana."  Id.  With all respect to the DEA and 
my colleagues, I must demur.  The difference in pounds seized is indeed 
overwhelming but, again, the explanation is not. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The government's interest in preventing abuse of a given drug is not 
proportional to the drug's prevalence.  By classifying both marijuana and 
peyote as Schedule I controlled substances, Congress has determined that 
the federal government has a compelling interest in preventing the illegal 
distribution and use of both drugs.  Moreover, this quantitative 
justification, standing alone, is difficult to reconcile with Larson.  In 
that case, the Supreme Court invalidated a provision of a Minnesota statute 
exempting religious organizations that receive more than fifty percent of 
their funds from members ("fifty percent rule") from certain registration 
and reporting requirements imposed on charitable organizations engaged in 
fundraising.  The practical consequence of this provision was to confer a 
preference on well-established denominations.  Applying strict scrutiny to 
the State's justification of the preference, the Court conceded Minnesota's 
compelling interest in protecting it's citizens from abusive solicitation 
practices but concluded that it had failed to demonstrate that the fifty 
percent rule was closely fitted to further that interest.  456 U.S. at 251, 
102 S.Ct. at 1686-87. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     Minnesota justified the rule on the ground that it could be assumed 
that members of religious organizations exercise control over both the 
internal solicitation of contributions and the expenditure of the funds 
that they contribute.  Id. at 248, 102 S.Ct. at 1685.   The State asserted 
that where these safeguards do not exist, public 
</pre>
<p>
<hr>
1471<br> 
OLSEN v. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMIN.<br>
Cite as 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1989)<p> 
<pre> 
disclosure is necessary.  Id.  The Court rejected this justification for 
three reasons.  First, it determined that the State had failed to provide 
any evidence demonstrating that members of religious organizations "will 
effectively control the organization if they contribute more than half of 
its solicited income," id. at 249, 102 S.Ct. at 1686 (emphasis original); 
second, the State had not suppported its assumption "that membership 
control is an adequate safeguard against abusive solicitations of the 
public by the organization," id. at 250, 102 S.Ct. at 1686; and third, the 
Court rejected a premise behind the fifty percent rule that the need for 
public disclosure corresponds to the percentage of nonmember contributions.   
Id. at 251, 102 S.Ct. at 1686-87. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The Supreme Court's detailed scrutiny of Minnesota's justification of 
the fifty percent rule underscores the superficiality of the DEA's 
Justification of its denominational preference in this case.  The DEA 
offers no reason why it could not have tailored a closer fit than its out-
of-hand denial of the requested exemption.  The DEA finds no difficulty in 
monitoring the compliance by the more than 250,000 members of the Native 
American Church with the limited use of peyote permitted for ceremonial 
purposes, and the majority offers good reasons why this should be so.  Maj. 
op. at 1464.  Yet the only reason the agency gives for concluding that 
monitoring compliance by the estimated one to two hundred communicants of 
the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church living in the United States (Amicus 
Memorandum at 11) should be more difficult is that our streets are awash in 
marijuana.  Without further explanation, I find this reasoning less than 
compelling.  As in the case of the Native American Church, the exemption 
would place no restriction on the ageney's normal enforcement activities 
beyond the parameters of the Church's place of worship during the limited 
number of hours in which the sacramental use of marijuana would be 
permitted. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The majority notes a significant problem the DEA might face if it were 
to grant Olsen's request: 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
   Were the DEA to consider a marijuana 
   exemption, equal protection (and/or the 
   establishment clause ...) would indeed 
   appear to command that it do so even- 
   handedly.  The DEA would have no war- 
   rant to contain the exemption to a single 
   church or religion. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
Maj. op. at 1464 (citations omitted).  I find the majority's "opening the 
floodgate" argument more persuasive than anything the DEA has offered.  It 
is for the agency, however, to make the argument and to explain why it 
would find itself unable to cope with the flood of similar applications, 
not for us to speculate about them. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     Finally, the majority supports the denial of the exemption to Olsen by 
arguing that 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
      Even if we were to credit Olsen's equal 
   protection argument or the dissent's por- 
   trayal of it in terms of the establishment 
   clause, the remedy Olsen requests hardly 
   follows.  Faced with the choice between 
   invalidation and extension of any con- 
   trolled-substances religious exemption, 
   which would the political branches 
   choose?  It would take a court bolder 
   than this one to predict, as our dissenting 
   colleague appears to suggest, that exten- 
   sion, not invalidation, would be the prob- 
   able choice. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
Maj. op. at 1464.  I have two responses.  First, the Supreme Court has 
consistently recognized that conceptual problems regarding appropriate 
remedial actions do not relieve us of our obligation to review government 
classifications that are impermissibly underinclusive.  See, e.g., Arkansas 
Writer's Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 95 L.Ed.2d 
209 (1987) (finding Arkansas statute unconstitutionally underinclusive).  
Second, we would not be called upon to make the choice the majority 
describes if, as I believe appropriate, we were to remand the case to the 
DEA for further consideration in light of its Establishment Clause 
implications. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
                                    IV. 
</pre>  
<p>  
<pre>  
     The DEA has chosen to accommodate one religion but not another.  The 
Establishment Clause compels the agency to justify its distinction and 
requires us to scrutinize the agency's rationale strictly.  Given this 
demanding standard of review, I must 
</pre>
<p>
<hr> 
1472<br>
878 FEDERAL REPORTER, 2d SERIES<p> 
<pre> 
conclude that the agency has failed to satisfy its burden.  Accordingly, I 
would grant Olsen's petition for review and remand to the agency for 
reconsideration without reaching Olsen's Free Exercise challenge.

THE GANJA MAN  
</pre>

<pre>

<pre>  
     James Tranmer would gladly die for marijuana.  
     He's offered to go smiling to the gallows, throw the noose  
around his own neck, then pull the lever.  He'd prefer that the  
rope be made of hemp, but it's not a demand.  
     The U.S. government has not taken him up on his offer.   
Instead -- as a consolation prize of sorts -- the government has  
given him 35 years in a federal prison.  A sentence tantamount to  
life for the 50-year-old Tranmer.  
     A gothic drama of changing times and values, the story of  
James Tranmer reveals a great deal about the government's &quot;War on  
Drugs,&quot; and our society as a whole.  
     If you listen to Tranmer, he's being persecuted for his  
religious belief in a plant that's fallen out of political favor.   
A euphoric, spiritual herb that's a part of creation and  
completely harmless.  
     If you listen to the government, Tranmer is being punished  
for conspiracy to import into Panama City thousands of pounds of  
marijuana -- a pernicious, addling Schedule I drug.  A drug with  
no redeeming qualities and a vast potential for abuse.  
     According to the government, Tranmer is just another drug  
dealer.  
     But even hardened courtroom regulars admit that there's  
something different about Tranmer.  
     Most people brought into court on drug charges vehemently  
deny any association with drugs, says Johnny Johnson, Bay County  
liaison for the U.S. Marshals.  
     And never, he says, do they sing a drug's praises -- which  
is exactly what Tranmer did.  &quot;In a way,&quot; Johnson admits, &quot;you  
gotta respect the guy.&quot;  
     Tranmer's lawyer refused to put him on the stand during the  
trial.  But at his July sentencing in Panama City's federal  
courthouse, Tranmer spoke his piece, praising marijuana -- over  
and over and over.  
     &quot;I'm an herb man.  I've always been an herb man,&quot; Tranmer  
said in part.  &quot;You cannot win this fight against marijuana.  If  
you fight against the herb, you fight against creation.&quot;  
     The judge was having none of it.  &quot;By the look on the  
judge's face,&quot; Tranmer says, &quot;I knew it was boring him -- I knew  
it didn't really make any difference.  But, you know, I did say  
what I felt.&quot;  
     Soon after Tranmer gave his impassioned speech, a pelican  
crashed into a power line outside the courthouse, dying in a huge  
fireball.  The courthouse went dark.  
     Friends of Tranmer took the pelican's death as a good sign - 
- a sign that even if the judge wasn't listening, maybe somebody,  
somewhere was.  
     At it's core, the story of James Tranmer revolves around a  
hardy weed that grows wild in all 50 states.  An herb that  
continues to inspire debate like no other &quot;drug.&quot;  
     Supporters tout marijuana as a spiritual herb with near- 
magical powers and a host of medical and societal uses.  
     Opponents decry it as a mind-erasing gateway to more drugs  
and to increasing irresponsible behavior.  
     Both sides admit it is addling, but disagree wildly whether  
or not this is good.  
     Marijuana's &quot;high&quot; is difficult to measure, but its other  
effects, when examined objectively, seem rather benign.  
     The entry under marijuana in the 1992 edition of the MERCK  
Manual reads, in part: &quot;Although many dangers of marijuana are  
frequently cited, there is still little evidence of biologic  
damage, even among relatively heavy users.  This is true even in  
the areas intensely investigated, such as immunologic and  
reproductive function.&quot;  The MERCK Manual, used by medical  
personnel nationwide, is the definitive guide on substances'  
effects on people.  
     No person in the 5,000-year history of marijuana use has  
ever died from the herb, and it is one of the few &quot;drugs&quot; for  
which there is no known fatal dose.  
     It has been estimated that in order to ingest a lethal dose  
of marijuana, a person would have to smoke 100 pounds of the  
stuff every minute for 15 minutes.  
     &quot;I'd like to be the first to try that,&quot; Tranmer says,  
laughing.  &quot;What a great way to go.&quot;  
     Tranmer first laid eyes on marijuana in 1965.  He promptly  
smoked it.  
     &quot;I realized immediately that there was something to the  
marijuana,&quot; he says.  &quot;I realized everybody had lied to me.   
Realized that this was not the demonic thing that everybody  
claimed it was.  It was a wonderful sensation, a wonderful  
feeling.  The rapport and the camaraderie among the people was  
very different than anything I ever experienced before.  I still  
didn't really understand or comprehend anything about it, but I  
knew I was going to be smoking marijuana for quite some time.&quot;  
     So began a fierce devotion.  A devotion that's led Tranmer  
on a most unlikely journey.  
     After 1965, Tranmer traveled the world looking for good  
ganja.  Then, in 1970 he smoked some Jamaican stuff -- and it was  
off to Jamaica.  He lived there on and off throughout the 70s,  
becoming a priest in the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church and growing  
to appreciate the true spiritual nature of the magical herb.   
While there, he was interviewed by 60 Minutes' Dan Rather.  
     In the late 1970s, a little known Miami-area prosecutor  
named Janet Reno battled Tranmer and the Coptics in court over  
their claimed religious right to smoke ganja.  The Coptics lost,  
Reno won.  
     Through it all, Tranmer smoked.  Thousands and thousands of  
times.  
     He is a ganja man, and his record reflects this: over 20  
marijuana arrests.  
     For his latest offense, he will probably die in jail.  
     He wouldn't change a thing.  &quot;I'm overjoyed,&quot; he says.  
     Johnny Johnson admits that Tranmer seems intelligent, but  
fears the man is sadly misled.  
     Tranmer insists he's not.  His salvation, he says, revolves  
around doing what he knows to be right.  His salvation revolves  
around marijuana, his sacrament, his personal window to the  
spirit of God.  
     &quot;The more they persecute me wrongfully,&quot; he says, &quot;the  
better off I am.&quot;  
     Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug by the federal  
government.  In other words, it has a high potential for abuse,  
no approved medical uses and no safe dose.  Cocaine and PCP, on  
the other hand, are classified as Schedule II, and can be  
prescribed by doctors.  
     Thanks to machinery put in place by Ronald Reagan, the same  
legal tools associated with drugs like cocaine are being brought  
to bear on marijuana and marijuana users: broad search-and- 
seizure powers, civil forfeiture laws, expanded application of  
conspiracy laws.  The list is long.  
     You almost have to be stoned, Tranmer says, to comprehend  
the awesome size of the umbrella called &quot;conspiracy.&quot;  Tranmer is  
reluctant to discuss the merits of his case, but there are others  
that are illustrative.  Consider, for example, the case of Mark  
Young, now serving a life sentence in federal prison for  
&quot;conspiracy to manufacture&quot; marijuana.  He simply introduced a  
marijuana buyer to a marijuana seller/manufacturer.  
     According to federal records, roughly one in six inmates in  
the federal prison system has been prosecuted primarily for a  
marijuana offense.  About 15,000 people -- a number that now  
includes Tranmer.  
     It wasn't always that way.  
     Thanks largely to an increase in popularity among the white  
middle class, marijuana use was widely tolerated in the 1960s and  
1970s on both the state and federal levels.  
     During the 1970s, 11 states decriminalized marijuana, and  
many other states relaxed their laws.  
     The Shafer Commission -- appointed by President Richard  
Nixon in 1972 to study the marijuana question -- advocated  
federal de-criminalization of marijuana for personal use.  During  
his presidency, Jimmy Carter came out for this de facto  
legalization.  In 1977, the DEA said it was a viable policy  
option.  
     But when Reagan came to office in 1980 and began his  
ballyhooed &quot;War on Drugs,&quot; marijuana suddenly and mysteriously  
became a scourge on the national character.  
     States gradually tightened their laws.  Federal laws became  
more and more stringent.  
</pre>

<pre>  
IT'S COMPLICATED  
     With more than 60 unique components, many of which are  
addling, the gummy yellow resin secreted by the marijuana plant  
is complicated.  
     And perhaps the same could be said of James Tranmer.  
     He is a terribly difficult man to describe.  An interesting,  
intelligent, contradictory man, Tranmer does not fit easily into  
any simple classification.  
     He regularly sings in jail and laughs with visitors about  
how society is unraveling.  He is surprisingly upbeat at the  
prospect of facing 35 years -- and probably death -- in prison.   
This, despite his assertion: &quot;I know I'm not a criminal.  And I  
know I've never hurt anybody.&quot;  
     Nicknamed &quot;Judge&quot; by his prison inmates, he will not let  
them lapse into immorality in his presence.  
     He is an optimist, yet he holds out little hope that he'll  
be free again.  
     He wants to be the first person executed for ganja, but  
admits the world would little notice.  
</pre>

<pre>  
UNFAIR FIGHT  
     Both sides of the marijuana debate agree that thousands of  
lives have been ruined, but disagree as to the culprit: marijuana  
or the laws that forbid its use.  
     But, in a way, it is not a fair fight.  
     Marijuana opponents, after all, are far better organized and  
better financed than marijuana supporters.  
     Bay County's foremost marijuana advocate outside of Tranmer  
is Robert Lawrence -- a subsistence farmer and sometimes musician  
living in virtual exile in the dusty hamlet of Fountain.  
     &quot;He is a simple man,&quot; Tranmer says, &quot;but full of wisdom.&quot;  
     Lawrence says that a lot of people agree with him.  &quot;But if  
all the rich and famous people in Bay County came out and said  
the laws are wrong, they'd lose their jobs and end up poor  
hippies like us.&quot;  
     The marijuana opponents, after all, include the federal  
government.  There is a huge bureaucracy backing the status quo.   
And there are prison sentences.  
     Most of Tranmer's &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; are either in jail  
or so battered and beaten up by years of evading the law that  
they've all but given up the struggle.  
     The government insists it's right.  Tranmer does the same.  
     But, in the final analysis, there is no question that  
proposing the legalization of marijuana is political poison.  And  
no question that legalization is a long shot.  
     James Tranmer doesn't care.  
     He knows he's right.  And he's sticking to it.  Damn the  
government.  
     &quot;People hate to hear the truth,&quot; he says.  &quot;They hate the  
spirit person.  And they hate the ganja man.  That's why they  
must persecute me.&quot;  
     Tranmer is now being transferred from Panama City's downtown  
jail to a federal prison in Lewisburg, Penn.  
     But one suspects that wherever he goes, he will continue his  
devotion to marijuana.  Wherever he goes, he will ask to be  
hanged for his beloved herb.  
     And wherever he goes, an odd jailhouse sound will be heard:  
singing.

         Appeal from the Superior Court of Riverside County


                Honorable Robert Spitzer, Judge


         OPENING BRIEF SUBMITTED ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT


                   STATEMENT OF APPEALABILITY

     This appeal is from a final judgment following trial and is

authorized by Penal Code section 1237.


                      STATEMENT OF THE CASE

     By an indictment filed on May 25, 1994, appellant was charged

with two counts of violations of the Health and Safety Code.  Count

1 alleged that appellant did wilfully sell, furnish, and

administer, and offer to sell, furnish, and administer, marijuana

and transport and give away, and offer to transport and give away,

and attempt to transport more than 28.5 grams of marijuana in

violation of, section 11360, subdivision (a) of the Health and


                               1
<HR>Safety Code, a felony.  Count 2 alleged that appellant did wilfully

possess marijuana for sale in violation of section 11359 of the

Health and Safety Code, a felony. (C.T. pp. 1-2.)

     A bench trial commenced on April 11, 1995. (R.T. p. 6.)  On

May 19, 1995, appellant was found guilty of transportation of

marijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of sale under

counts 1 and 2 of the indictment. (R.T. pp. 519-20.)

     Sentencing was conducted on July 10, 1995. (R.T. p. 523)  The

proceeding was suspended and formal probation was granted for a

period of 60 months. (R.T. pp. 535-539; C.T. pp. 271-273.)


                               2
<HR>                      STATEMENT OF FACTS

     Appellant is a member and priest of the Israel Zion Coptic

Church which is incorporated in the state of Wisconsin. (C.T. p.

71; 114 [Appellant's testimony at the August 29, 1994 hearing<SUP><A HREF="#1">1</A></SUP> was

admitted into evidence at trial. (R.T. pp. 9-10)].  The Israel

Zion Coptic Church is an offshoot of the Rastafarian movement and

the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, (R.T. pp. 334-342 and C.T. p.

84.) and is comprised of approximately 200 to 250 members. (C.T.

p. 74.)  The Israel Zion Coptic's doctrine incorporates the use of

marijuana, or ganja, as a sacrament during religious services and

gatherings. (C.T. pp. 71-73; 114.)

     In the past, appellant had attempted to provide the sacrament

for the church by growing marijuana in Wisconsin. (R.T. p. 392.)

However, he was arrested for this activity, and was thus prohibited

from growing the sacrament. (R.T. p. 392-393.)

     Appellant eventually decided to travel to San Diego to

purchase a supply of marijuana for the church's use. (R.T. pp.

391-394.)  Approximately $4,000.00 was collected from appellant and

two other church members in order to make the purchase. (R.T. 349-

395.)

     Appellant then travelled to San Diego and bought 40 pounds of

marijuana. (R.T. pp. 400-402.)  On March 27, 1994, appellant was

driving his automobile through the Temecula border patrol

(C.T. p. 19-26 [A transcript of the Grand Jury proceedings was

admitted into evidence at trial. (R.T. p. 14)].)  Appellant's

vehicle was subsequently directed to the secondary inspection area

where a canine sniff was performed. (C.T. pp. 19-21.)

     The canine "alerted," and the border patrol conducted a search

of the vehicle. (C.T. pp. 21-23.)  Consequently, border patrol

agents located the 40 pounds of marijuana which appellant had

placed in two duffle bags in the trunk of his vehicle. (C.T. pp.

23-24.)  Agent Joel Ontiveros then advised appellant of his Miranda

rights and placed appellant under arrest. (C.T. p. 37.)  After

additional searching, agents also confiscated $2,350.00 cash

located in the interior of appellant's vehicle. (C.T. p. 39.)

          THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A
          CONVICTION OF GUILT BASED UPON INTENT TO SELL
          MARIJUANA


<B>A.   Summary of Argument</B>

     Appellant was found guilty of possessing marijuana for

purposes of sale in violation of section 11369 of the Health and

Safety Code. (R.T. pp. 519-20.)  However, the evidence presented

at trial demonstrated that appellant had no intent to sell the

marijuana he had obtained.  Rather, the marijuana was to be given

away as a sacrament.

<B>B.   Standard of Review</B>

     In determining whether a reasonable trier of fact could have

found a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the appellate

court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the

respondent and presume in support of the judgment the existence of

every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.

(People v. Johnson (1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 567-577.)  The court does

not, however, limit its review to the evidence favorable to the

respondent.  Rather, the task is two fold:  First, the court must

resolve the issue in the light of the whole record and may not

limit the appraisal to isolated bits of evidence selected by the

respondent.  Second, the court must judge whether the evidence of

each of the essential elements is substantial.  It is not enough

for the respondent simply to point to "some" evidence supporting

the finding, because not all surface conflicts of evidence remain


                               5
<HR>substantial in the light of other facts. (Id., at p. 577.)


<B>C.   Insufficient Evidence of Intent to Sell</B>

     Unlawful possession of a controlled substance for sale

requires proof the defendant possessed the contraband with the

intent of selling it. (People v. Meza (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1741,

1745.)  However, the evidence in this case establishes that the

appellant had no intention, whatsoever, of selling the marijuana he

obtained in California.

     At trial, the prosecution questioned appellant regarding his

intended use of the sacrament as follows:

     Q.   Well, isn't part of that 13 pounds going to go to
          some other people?

     A.   Possibly.  It probably would have.  It would have--
          it was a--it's the sacramental food or object that
          I need to practice my religion, and of course it
          would have been consumed that way within a
          communion and shared with others.

     Q.   But you're not going to break off, say, a pound or
          two and give it to somebody else?

     A.   I've given a pound or two to Brother Michael at
          times.

     Q.   So you just give him the pound?

     A.   Yes.

     . . . .

     Q.   Within your Church, though, you don't have any kind
          of like a --- you might see in Christian church an
          offering plate that people donate money to for the
          ganja to be purchased, do you?

     A.   No.

     Q.   It really comes from the money you earn from your
          work?

                               6
<HR>     A.   Right.  But I would--I would--brothers and sisters
          are free and welcomed to put some money towards--if
          that's what we have to continue to do and that's
          our access to the sacrament, then we'll do that.

     Q.   Do they do that from time to time?

     A.   Yes.

     Q.   And you talked about other people who might not be
          members of the Church.  If they come over and
          partake of the sacrament and stay with you for a
          day or so, do they sometimes contribute money?

     A.   No.  There's no--there's no--I don't require
          somebody to give me some money to be able to
          partake in the sacrament.

     Q.   I understand that.  I'm not saying you require.
          Sometimes do they--

     A.   I don't accept it.  I don't accept it at all.  To
          sit and partake of the sacrament with me, there's
          no--no, there is no money offering like that at
          all.

(R.T. pp. 406-407.)

     It is true that possession of a large amount of a controlled

substance "itself affords a reasonable inference of possession for

sale." (People v. Grant (1969) 1 C.A.3d 563, 570.)  However, the

evidence presented at trial entirely rebutted any reasonable

inference that the appellant was involved in illegal sale of a

controlled substance.  On the contrary, appellant's testimony has

established that he did not require others to pay money in exchange

for partaking in the sacrament.  Moreover, he would not accept

money for the sacrament, even if it was offered to him.  Given this

testimony, there is absolutely no basis upon which to support a

conviction of guilt for the possession of marijuana for sale in

violation of section 11359 of the Health and Safety Code.

<HR>                              II

          THE TRIAL COURT CANNOT SIDE-STEP THE FIRST
          AMENDMENT FREEDOM OF RELIGION ISSUE ON THE
          BASIS THAT APPELLANT'S ACTS CONSTITUTED A
          COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY


A.   Summary of the Argument

     Although the court acknowledged that appellant's "religious

practices may be constitutionally protected," it nevertheless

convicted appellant for illegal commercial activity, i.e.,

possessing and transporting marijuana, in violation of the Health

and Safety Code.  The court thus "side-stepped" the freedom of

religion issue.  Although appellant has been convicted of

possessing and transporting marijuana, he argues that his

constitutional right to free exercise of religion through the

partaking of the sacrament is meaningless without the right to

possess and transport that sacrament.  Thus, the court must address

the First Amendment issues presented in this case and determine

whether there is some compelling state interest which would justify

the burden which has been placed on appellant's religious freedom.


B.   Appellant's Church Affiliation

     The evidence presented at trial established that appellant was

a bona fide member of the Israel Zion Coptic Church. (R.T. pp.

518-519.)  Appellant testified as follows:

     Q.   . . . Do you follow a practice of a particular
          religion, Mr. Peck?

     A.   Yes, I do.


                              8
<HR>     Q.   What is that?

     A.   I follow the Israel Zion Coptic Church religion.

     Q.   Is that an organized church in some state?

     A.   Yes, it is.  We're incorporated in the state of
          Wisconsin.

     Q.   Do you have a particular position in the church
          that you occupy?

     A.   Yes, I do.  I'm an elder.  And as far as the
          incorporation of the church, I'm the president on
          the document.

     Q.   And would you characterized your position in the
          church as a lay person or an official or priest of
          the church?

     A.   I'm an official priest of the church.

     Q.   And did you, in fact, have in your possession 40
          pounds of marijuana or ganja sometime earlier in
          the year?

     A.   Yes, I did.

     Q.   Why did you have that in your possession, sir?

     A.   To obtain sacramental ganja for the members of my
          church.

(C.T. p. 71, 114 [Appellant's testimony at the August 29, 1994

hearing was admitted into evidence at trial. (R.T. pp. 9-10)].)

     As a member and priest of the Israel Zion Coptic Church, it

was necessary for appellant to obtain the sacramental marijuana, or

ganja, used in the religious practices.  Appellant testified to the

importance of this sacrament:

     Q.   Can you tell me how it is that ganja is a part of
          the religious practices that you practice?

     A.   The Coptic is a three-part doctrine, the way it was
          taught to me.  And the three elements that make up
          the body of Christ are the ganja, the word of
          truth, and the man.


                              9
<HR>     Q.   Do you feel, sir, that the--let me phrase it this
          way:  If ganja, or marijuana, was prohibited to
          you, could you practice the Israel Zion Coptic
          religion?

     A.   No.

     Q.   Is the prohibition of ganja or marijuana, does it
          have an effect on the services that you could
          perform in the church?

     A.   Well, it creates a burden, because we can be
          arrested for it.

     Q.   If you didn't have ganja or marijuana, would it be
          possible for you to conduct the services, the
          sacramental services of the church?

     A.   No.

     Q.   If you--during the church services, what part does
          ganja play in the church service?

     A.   Ganja is shared as communion.  It's the body and
          blood of Christ.  When we share the ganja and touch
          upon the subject of the King, which is the word of
          truth, and blend that with man, ourselves, then we
          are--we are Christ in the flesh.  That is Christ in
          the flesh.

     Q.   When you use ganja, do you use it as something that
          will allow you to achieve a particular state of
          mind?

     A.   No.  It's the herb, the word, and the man.  Those
          three elements together are Christ, that we then
          become a member of that body, which is Christ.

(C.T. pp. 72-73.)

     Based upon this evidence, the trial court found that for more

than ten years appellant had been a practicing member of the Israel

Zion Coptic Church, a religious organization incorporated under the

laws of the state of Wisconsin. (R.T. pp. 518-519.)  Furthermore,

the court found that a principal tenet of the Israel Zion Coptic

Church was to use marijuana as a sacramental herb. (R.T. p. 519.)


                               10
<HR>     The courts have considered similar cases involving controlled

substances and the defense of free exercise of religion in the

past, and yet failed to reach the First Amendment issue.  However,

these cases did not present evidence of a bona fide membership in

a belief system which reguired the use of marijuana as an integral

part of the religion, such that prohibition of the herb would

completely inhibit the religious practice.

     For example, in People v. Mitchell (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d

176, the defendant was charged with possession of marijuana and

with planting and cultivating marijuana in violation of the Health

and Safety Code.  The defendant argued that his use of marijuana

was in accordance with his religious beliefs, and therefore, he had

a constitutionally protected right to possess and use the narcotic.

(Id., at p. 177.)

     However, on cross examination, Mitchell acknowledged that he

was not a member of any organized religion.  Further, when asked

whether his smoking of marijuana was pursuant to a religious

practice, he stated, "in the sense that I believe that religion is

related to law or constitutionality, I was exercising the freedom

in my own home to smoke something actually better than tobacco."

(Id., at p. 181.)

     The Mitchell court thus found that the defendant had offered

no evidence that his use of marijuana constituted a religious

practice in any sense of that term. (Id, at p. 182.)  The court

concluded that because the record raised no issue as to the

exercise of religion, it was unnecessary to address the subject.


                               11
<HR>(Id., at pp. 182-183.)

     Similarly, in People v. Collins (1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 486, the

defendant testified that he used marijuana in order to extend and

intensify his ability to engage in meditative communication with

the Supreme Being, to attain spiritual peace through union with God

the Father, and to search out the ultimate meaning of life and

nature. (Id., at p. 487.)  However, the record demonstrated that

the defendant did not worship or sanctify marijuana, but merely

employed its hallucinogenic biochemical properties as an auxiliary

to a desired capacity for communication. (Id., at p. 487.)  Thus,

the court merely held that the existing law did not bar the

defendant from a practice which was indispensable to the pursuit of

his faith. (Id., at p. 488.)

     Unlike Mitchell and Collins, however, appellant in the instant

case has proven that he is a bona fide member of a legitimate

religious organization, that marijuana is an object of worship to

him, and that his use of marijuana as a sacrament is central,

integral, and necessary to the practice of that religion.

Therefore, the trial court had no rationale to side-step the issue

of free exercise of religion which is presented in this case.


C.   Appellant's Right to Obtain the Church's Sacrament

     The trial court convicted appellant for the transportation of

marijuana in violation of section 11360 of the Health and Safety

Code. (R.T. pp. 519-20.)  In doing so, the court held that

although appellant's "religious practices may be constitutionally


                               12
<HR>protected," his actions on or about March 24, 1994 in California

constituted "commercial activities outside the practice of [his]

religion, and therefore, were not constitutionally protected."

(R.T. p. 533.)  However, the result of such a ruling is to

acknowledge appellant's right to practice his religion, and yet

effectively deny him the means to go about exercising those

beliefs.

     Appellant testified that he had tried to avoid the

transportation of marijuana by growing the sacrament himself:

     Well, we had tried to provide our own sacrament.  I had
     grown the herb in Verona, Wisconsin, and was arrested for
     it.  I tried to provide it growing it with Brother
     Michael in Soldiers Grove, and we were unable to provide
     it that way.  The only alternative that was left was to
     purchase it somewhere.

(R.T. p. 392.)

     In sum, the court has told appellant that he has a right to

practice his religion (which includes the sincere belief in the

worship and use of marijuana as a sacrament); however, he may not

grow the ganja himself, and he may not obtain it by transporting it

from another location.  Such a result is not only disingenuous, but

it renders appellant's right to "free exercise of his religion"

absolutely meaningless.  The court must therefore address the First

Amendment issues in this case and set forth any compelling state

interest which would justify the burden which has been placed upon

Appellant's religious practices.<SUP><A HREF="#2">2</A></SUP>

                               13
<HR><B>D.   Peyote and the Native American Church</B>

     At trial, Randolf White, a member of the Native American

Church, testified with regard to the use of peyote within the

Church:

     Q.   Mr. White, in regards to your religious
          affiliation, sir, are you affiliated with a
          particular church or organization?

     A.   Yes, I am.

     Q.   What is that, sir?

     A.   Native American Church

     Q.   Is that Native American--is that the Native
          American Church of North America Incorporated?

     A.   It is.

     Q.   Are you a member of any particular sect or part of
          that religion?

     A.   I'm active in the group called the Ghost Clan of
          the Native American Church.

     Q.   As part of the rituals of the Ghost Clan, do you
          consume peyote?

     A.   Yes.

     Q.   Do you also consume cannabis as part of those
          rituals?

     A.   Sometimes, yes.

(R.T. pp. 36-37.)


     Q.   Mr. White, are you aware of whether or not there is
          a system in place that allows or accommodates the
          distribution of peyote?

     A.   There is such a system, yes.

     Q.   Could you explain to us how it works?


                               14
<HR>     A.   Someone who wishes to be a peyote distributor
          applies to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
          Drugs--or I guess it's the DEA now--for a permit to
          get what's called a narcotics dealership.  Peyote
          is a Schedule 1 controlled substance which makes it
          extraordinarily difficult to meet the reguirements
          of the government, but essentially the state of
          Texas and the federal government have gotten
          together.  There is a permit issued by the DEA for
          the narcotics permission license.  It's issued to
          the location rather than the individual.  It's a
          location that's owned by the church, and there are
          certain security measures which are reguired to be
          in place that I'm not at liberty to discuss.
          Essentially, these are all located in the state of
          Texas, primarily Amarillo City.

     Q.   When the people go out and gather the peyote
          buttons from the field, do they go to an
          intermediary, one of these distributors in general?

     A.   In general, people--members of the Native American
          Church don't have the time to harvest the peyote
          themselves because it's a laborious and time-
          consuming affair.  It's kept by these licensed
          distributors.  They hold it.  The peyote itself is
          never sold as such.  However, you can place a
          monetary value on the peyote, which at this time is
          about $125 per thousand buttons of various sizes.

          Sometimes the cash payment is actually made, but
          it's generally understood the peyote--the medicine
          itself is a gift.  It's not subject to cash, and
          this is part of the bylaws of the church, and it
          is--when you take the peyote--let's say you did
          take it.  You leave something there.  It might be
          a cigar in a plastic case where you picked up the
          first peyote button.  But the philosophy is if you
          take something, you leave something.

          The same philosophy holds true later in what might,
          in other words, be described as commerce where
          there's a trading.  A barter agreement takes place.
          If I would give you a gift, it would not be
          unreasonable to give me another gift.  Some people
          say they buy it, but technically they try to avoid
          it.

     Q.   In obtaining the medicine, peyote, do you have to--
          you have to arrange for transportation from that
          area of Texas to wherever it is in the United
          States that it is being used?


                               15
<HR>     A.   Yes.

     Q.   Does peyote grow naturally in this area of the Rio
          Grand Valley?

     A.   No.

     Q.   So if you were in Oklahoma and you wanted to
          practice your religion, you would necessarily have
          to get that from Texas to Oklahoma somehow?

     A.   You would either do that, or you would have to grow
          it yourself.

(R.T. pp. 43-45.)

     Mr. White's testimony reveals that a state and federal system

has been established for the harvesting, distribution, and

transportation of peyote, a Schedule I narcotic, for use in the

religious services of the Native American Church.  To deny the

Israel Zion Coptic Church members the establishment of a similar

system is simply to discriminate against this religious

organization.  Thus, appellant's right to the free exercise of his

religion requires that he not only be allowed to harvest the

marijuana necessary for the sacrament, but that he also be allowed

to transport marijuana, if necessary, to his place of worship.

<HR>                             III

          THE TRIAL COURT CANNOT SIDE-STEP THE FIRST
          AMENDMENT ISSUE AND IMPOSE PROBATION
          CONDITIONS WHICH BURDEN APPELLAAT'S FREEDOM OF
          ASSOCIATION AND FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION


<B>A.   Summary of the Argument</B>

     Under the terms of appellant's probation, he is prohibited

from associating with anyone who uses marijuana.  However, such a

prohibition effectively prevents appellant from associating with

his church brethren given that members are typically marijuana

users.  Before appellant's right of religious association can be

burdened, the court must find some compelling state interest.

However, the trial court, in "side-stepping" this First Amendment

issue, has failed to designate such a compelling state interest

which would justify the infringement on appellant's right to

associate.  Likewise, the probation conditions prohibiting

appellant from using marijuana must also be justified by a finding

of a compelling state interest.


<B>B.   Factual Backaround</B>

     Appellant was sentenced on July 10, 1995. (R.T. p. 523.)  The

proceeding was suspended and formal probation was granted for a

period of 60 months under certain terms and conditions.  Under the

terms of probation, appellant is, inter alia, not to associate with

any unrelated person known to be a possessor, user, or trafficker

of controlled substances, and not to possess or use any controlled

substance. (R.T. pp. 536.)


                               17
<HR><B>C.   Freedom of Association</B>

     Although the freedom of association is not explicitly set out

in the First Amendment, the right to associate with others in

pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, and

cultural ends, including religious beliefs, has long been held to

be implicit in the freedoms of speech, assembly, and petition.

(Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984) 468 U.S. 609, 622 [82

L.Ed. 2d 462, 104 S.Ct. 3244]; Healy v. James (1972) 408 U.S. 169,

181 [33 L.Ed.2d 266, 280, 92 S.Ct. 2338].)

     The freedom to associate with the persons of one's choice,

without unwarranted governmental intervention or interference, is

divided into two components: the freedom of intimate association

and the freedom of expressive association. (Roberts v. United

States Jaycees, sunra, 468 U.S. 609, 617-618.)

     Intimate association stands constitutionally protected because

"choices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human

relationships must be secured against undue intrusion by the State

because of the role of such relationships in safeguarding the

individual freedom that is central to our constitutional scheme."

(Roberts v. United States Jaycees, supra, 468 U.S. 609, 617-618.)

Thus, "freedom of [intimate] association receives protection as a

fundamental element Of personal liberty. (Roberts v. United States

Jaycees, supra, 468 U.S. 609, 618.)

     Freedom of expressive association stands protected as an

"indispensable means of preserving" the liberty to "associate for

the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First


                               18
<HR>Amendment--speech, assembly, petition for the redress of

grievances, and the exercise of religion." (Roberts v. United

States Jaycees, supra, 468 U.S. 609, 618.)

     The right to associate for expressive purposes is not,

however, absolute.  Infringements on that right may be justified by

regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated

to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means

significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.

(Roberts, 468 U.S. at 623.)

     The probation condition which prohibits appellant from

associating with any unrelated person known to be a user of

controlled substances effectively prohibits appellant from

associating with his brethren in the Israel Zion Coptic Church,

given that the use marijuana is a principal tenet of their

religion. (R.T. p. 519.)  Before appellant's freedom of

association can be infringed, however, there must first be a

finding of some compelling state interest which justifies the

burden.

     The trial court avoided the First Amendment issues in this

case, and convicted appellant for transportation and possession of

marijuana under the Health and Safety Code.  However, even if the

crimes under which appellant was convicted did not implicate a

burden on his religious freedom, the terms of probation do create

such a burden.  Thus, the issue of a compelling state interest must

be addressed, and the court should not be allowed to side-step the

matter.  In addition, without a finding of some compelling state


                               19
<HR>interest which would justify the burden on appellant's religious

association, the condition prohibiting appellant from associating

with marijuana users must be stricken.


<B>D.   Other Terms of probation</B>

     The terms of probation also included the conditions that

appellant would not possess or use any controlled substances unless

medically prescribed, and that he would submit to chemical tests of

blood, breath, and urine, and physical tests for the detection of

controlled substances. (R.T. p. 536.)  However, the trial court

found that "a principal tenet of the Israel Zion Coptic Church is

to use marijuana as a sacramental herb. . ." and that "Church

members believe that God is experienced or that one may commune

with God through the smoking of marijuana." (R.T. p. 519.)  Thus,

by instituting probation terms which prohibit appellant from using

marijuana, the trial court has burdened appellant's freedom of

religion.  However, the trial court then failed to address the

First Amendment issues, as discussed more fully below.  In choosing

to evade these issues, the trial court has failed to designate a

compelling state interest which would justify the probational

infringements upon appellant's right to free exercise of his

religion.  Thus, these conditions must also be stricken.

<HR>                               IV

          APPELLANT'S USE OF MARIJUANA IS PROTECTED BY
          THE FIRST AMENDMENT'S FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE


<B>A.   Summary of the Argument</B>

     Appellant has been a member of the Israel Zion Coptic Church

for more than ten years. (R.T. pp. 518-519.)  As such, he

considers marijuana to be a sacrament as well as an actual object

of worship. (R.T. p. 519.)  Thus, appellant argues that the First

Amendment's free exercise clause protects his use of the sacrament

during worship.  Furthermore, appellant contends that there is no

compelling state interest which would justify the state's

infringement upon his use of marijuana in the free exercise of his

religion.

<B>B.   Applicable Law</B>

     Appellant contends that his use of marijuana is protected by

the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.<SUP><A HREF="#3">3</A></SUP>

     The Health and Safety Code statutes which deal with the use,

possession, and sale of marijuana and hashish were enacted pursuant

to a legislative determination that such laws promote the public

health, safety, and welfare, and are necessary for the protection

of society as a whole. (People v. Aguiar (1968) 257 Cal.App.2d

597, 601.)
___________________

     <SUP><A NAME="3">3</A></SUP>The First Amendment provides in pertinent part, "Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof, . . . ."  The First
Amendment is made applicable to the states through the liberty
component of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Cantwell v. Connecticut
(1940) 310 U.S. 296, 303, 84 L.Ed. 1213, 1217-1218, 60 S.Ct. 900.)


                               21
<HR>     Appellant argues that these statutes unconstitutionally

infringe upon the free exercise of his religion by prohibiting his

use of marijuana, a sacrament in the Israel Zion Coptic Church.  In

support of his argument, appellant relies upon People v. Woody

(1964) 61 Cal.2d 716.

     In Woody, a group of Navajo Native Americans performed

religious ceremonies involving the use of peyote.  The evidence in

Woody demonstrated that the Navajo considered peyote not only a

sacrament, but an actual object of worship similar to the bread and

wine in certain Christian churches. (Woody, supra, 61 Cal.2d 716,

721.)

     The Navajo were convicted of violating former Health and

Safety Code section 11500.  In reversing that conviction, the

California Supreme Court held that the state may abridge religious

practices only upon a determination that some compelling state

interest outweighs the defendant's interests in religious freedom.

(Woody, supra, 61 Cal.2d 716, 718.)  The Court then set forth a

two-pronged test with respect to the defense of religious freedom:

First it must be determined whether the statute in question imposes

any burden upon the free exercise of the defendant's religion, and

second, if there is such a burden, whether some compelling state

interest justifies the infringement. (Woody, sutra, 61 Cal.2d 716,

718, citing, Sherbert v. Verner (1963) 374 U.S. 398 [10 L.Ed 2d

965, 83 S.Ct. 1790].)

     In Woody, the Court held that the Navajo's use of peyote was

such an integral part of their religious faith that it would be


                               22
<HR>impossible to prohibit its use without inhibiting the practice of

the faith itself, and therefore, prohibition of the use of peyote

would constitute a burden on their exercise of religion. (Woody,

supra, 61 Cal.2d 716, 716.)  The Woody Court then found that the

evidence indicated there was no compelling reason for the

prohibition of Peyotism.  Specifically, peyote was not used in

place of proper medical care, and there was no evidence that the

Navajo who used peyote were more liable to become addicted to other

narcotics than non-peyote-using Navajo.  Additionally, the record

did not substantiate the state's fear of indoctrination of small

children.  Finally, the expert evidence demonstrated that the use

of peyote presented no permanent deleterious injury to the Navajo.

(Woody, 61 Cal.2d at 722.)

    In Employment Division Department of Human Resources of Oregon

v. Smith (1990) 494 U.S. 872 [108 L. Ed. 2d 876], the Supreme Court

held that under the Free Exercise Clause, a law that burdens

religious practice need not be justified by a compelling

governmental interest if it is neutral and of general

applicability.  However, Congress responded to that Supreme Court

decision by enacting The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993,

42 U.S. 2OOObb.  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, in its

declaration of purpose, states that Congress finds "in Employment

Division v. Smith (1990) 494 U.S. 872 [108 L.Ed.2d 876, 110 S.Ct.

1595], the Supreme Court virtually eliminated the requirement that

the government justify burdens on religious exercise imposed by

laws neutral toward religion."  Congress thus enacted the Religious


                               23
<HR>Freedom Restoration Act in order "to restore the compelling

interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner (1963) 374 U.S.

398 [10 L.Ed.2d 965, 83 S.Ct. 1790] and Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972)

406 U.S. 205 [32 L.Ed.2d 15, 92 S.Ct. 1526] and to guarantee its

application in all cases where free exercise of religion is

substantially burdened." (42 U.S.C. 2OOObb, subd. (b) (1).)


<B>C.   Burden on Appellant's Free Exercise of Religion</B>

     Like the peyote used by the Navajo church in Woody, the

evidence in the instant case demonstrated that the Israel Zion

Coptic Church considers marijuana to be a sacrament as well as an

actual object of worship.  At trial, appellant testified on cross-

examination as follows:

     Q.   You spoke yesterday about the importance of
          religion to your life.  Now describe for us the
          importance of marijuana, ganja, to your religion.

     A.   The herb was part of the whole doctrine that I
          received when I came and reasoned with brothers in
          the church.  They--they told me about the
          Rastafarian doctrine, that it was a three-part
          doctrine, it was the herb, the word, and the man.
          They explained that to me.  They said that the man
          is what we are, and that the word is the truth and
          the wisdom and understanding that God has given to
          us, and the herb is the sacrament, the burnt
          offering that we offer to God, and that the smoke
          carries our prayers up to God then.

     Q.   What I'm asking is not for you to describe the
          particular uses and meaning of marijuana, but just
          to tell us how important it is to the religion
          itself.

     A.   It's one of the three parts of the Trinity, the
          herb, the word, and the man.

     Q.   What I'm saying is--


                               24
<HR>     A.   Without the herb, you wouldn't have the Holy
          Trinity.  You would have the word and the man.  It
          would be a two-part doctrine.  It wouldn't be a
          three-part doctrine.  To be a Trinity, there has to
          be three.  Herb, word, and man.  You can't take any
          one of those parts away and have that three-part
          doctrine.

     Q.   All right.

     A.   It's so important that if you take it away, you no
          longer have a three-part doctrine.  You no longer
          have a holy Trinity.

     Q.   Would it be fair to say that the ganja is at the
          center of the belief?

     A.   When you have three things--I don't know if it
          would be at the center.

     Q.   But sharing with those other two?

     A.   Pardon me.

     Q.   Sharing with those other two, is it at the center?

     A.   It--right.

     Q.   And you said that your life yesterday would lose
          meaning without your religion?

     A.   Absolutely.

     Q.   So would it be fair to say that your world revolves
          around ganja?

     . . . .

     A.   My world revolves around ganja?  Ganja is a part of
          my religion.  It's a part of my spiritual
          expression and understanding and trying to
          understand the mysteries of God.  Whether my--my
          world revolves around ganja as much as it revolves
          around the word of God and my brothers and sisters.

     Q.   When you say that--when you describe that
          centrality of marijuana to your beliefs, how do you
          know that?  How do you know that marijuana is
          critical to your religion, or ganja?


                               25
<HR>     A.   I know that because that's how I began to revelate.
          That's how I began to understand.  And the mystery
          of the scriptures was open to me.

     Q.   This is personal enlightenment?

     A.   Yes, it's personal enlightenment.

     Q.   I assume you had that enlightenment while consuming
          ganja?

     A.   Yes, I did.

(R.T. pp. 377-379.)

     Appellant's testimony demonstrated that under the Israel Zion

Coptic doctrine, marijuana, or ganja, is a sacrament as well as a

part of the holy Trinity.  It is one of the three central elements

of the Israel Zion Coptic doctrine, and is critical to the exercise

of the religion and to personal enlightenment.

     The trial court's decision also reflected that the evidence

had proven the importance and centrality of marijuana to the Israel

Zion Coptic Church.  Specifically. the trial judge held:

     The Court will further find that a principal tenet of the
     Israel Zion Coptic Church is to use marijuana as a
     sacramental herb in an unstructured fashion not confined
     to any particular time/place, or ritual of worship.
     Church members believe that God is experienced or that
     one may commune with God through the smoking of
     marijuana. (R.T. p. 519.)

As in Woody, the evidence in the instant case demonstrated that

appellant's use of marijuana is such an integral part of his

religious faith that it would be impossible to prohibit its use

without inhibiting the practice of the faith itself.  Prohibition

of appellant's use of marijuana would constitute a burden on the

free exercise of his religion.  Therefore, appellant passes the

first prong of the Woody test.


                               26
<HR><B>D.   Compelling State Interest</B>

     The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that there is no

compelling state interest which justifies the impingement of

appellant's free exercise of religion.  The testimony of John P.

Morgan, M.D.<SUP><A HREF="#4">4</A></SUP>, included a discussion of a 1995 study performed in

Jamaica regarding the toxicological effects of marijuana. (R.T.

pp. 150-154.)  The study was funded by the United States National

Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA. (R.T. p. 151.)  According to this

study, the long-term effects of high doses<SUP><A HREF="#5">5</A></SUP> of cannabis were

extremely modest.

     Specifically, there was no evidence of impaired immune systems

or impaired pulmonary function, and no evidence of cognitive or

psychological dysfunction. (R.T. p. 153.)  Likewise, there are no

epidemiologic studies showing any increased prevalence of cancer in

marijuana smokers (R.T. p. 163).  And there is no evidence of brain

damage as a result of marijuana use. (R.T. p. 168.)  Furthermore,

there is no evidence that cannabis causes harm to the endocrine

system or the reproductive system, (R.T. p. 169) and no evidence of

<HR>damage to newborn babies whose mothers are very heavy ganja users.

(R.T. p. 171.)

     Surprisingly, despite the various studies funded by the United

States Government, the only adverse effect which has been proven is

that chronic marijuana smokers sometimes show bronchitis, or

irritation in their trachea and bronchiolus. (R.T. p. 161.)

However, Dr. Morgan testified that such changes are very minor and

will resolve when the marijuana is discontinued. (R.T. p. 161.)

     The increased incidence and severity of bronchitis in

marijuana users is much less than that of tobacco smokers. (R.T.

pp. 161-162.)  Dr. Morgan testified that:

     . . . [T]he kind of change seen in the large bronchiolus
     is not the kind of change that we see in tobacco smokers
     in the periphery of the lungs which leads to chronic
     bronchitis and emphysema.  None of the cannabis smokers
     have progressed at all to the pulmonary cripples that we
     see in chronic bronchitis and emphysema. (R.T. p. 161.)

     Further, unlike tobacco, cannabis has an extremely low

addiction potential. (R.T. p. 156-157.)  There is no evidence that

the use of marijuana will lead to "hard drugs." (R.T. p. 181-182.)

With regard to addiction and toxicity, Dr. Morgan testified:

     Q.   What is your opinion as to the relative toxicity of
          cannabis as opposed to alcohol?

     A.   Basically, cannabis is much, much lower in toxicity
          than alcohol any way you look at it.  Even given
          that most individuals who consume alcohol consume
          it at relatively low doses and don't have much
          harm, those individuals who consume it in high
          doses often experience harm, harm of a serious
          sort, and cannabis does not produce that kind of
          harm.

          Tobacco is a slightly different issue but still a
          very important one.  Tobacco, because of its means
          of administration and to some degree because of the


                               28
<HR>          effects of nicotine, is also a substance that in
          chronic use produces significant harm to humans and
          much, much greater than this shown for cannabis.

     Q.   Has cannabis ever demonstrated an addictive
          potential as nicotine?

     A.   Not addiction, addiction as an exponentially tested
          concept, and without being wordy, people still
          argue about what constitutes addiction, but there
          certainly--even though there are a few users of
          cannabis that appear to use in very, very high
          doses and say to themselves and to others I wish I
          could stop but I find it hard to stop, and those
          people could be described as having an addictive-
          type behavior.  The prevalence of that is so low in
          comparison to tobacco users or even to alcohol
          users that I prefer to say that cannabis has an
          extremely low addiction potential.

(R.T. pp. 156-157.)

     Dr. Morgan also testified that the Israel Zion Coptic Church

members follow certain rituals to prevent adverse effects from

marijuana use:

     Q.   Briefly for the record, could you describe what you
          mean by a ritualistic use from your observation or
          from the reports you've learned?

     A.   When I use the term "ritual," I'm talking about a
          rule-bound circumstance of use.  Whether the rules
          are written out or lectured about is not important
          but that the rules tend to be followed.

          For example, the Zion Coptic users, both the Israel
          and the Ethiopian sect, tend to use [marijuana] in
          groups, although not always.  They tend to use it
          in the context of a process they call reasoning in
          which they will sit and talk to each other and
          explore the spirituality of their lives and the
          impact of the drug. . . .

     Q.   Do you have an opinion as to what effect this
          ritualistic use has on abuse potential of cannabis?

     A.   I certainly do.  When people use drugs in a rule-
          bound, constrained ritualistic fashion, they really

<HR>          because, of course, it's rules that keeps us all
          safe when using dangerous substances and dangerous
          things.  You know, the power tool manufacturers
          publish rules on how you should use power tools,
          and if you follow those rules, by and large you
          will be protected.

(R.T. pp. 158-159.)

     The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that marijuana,

even in very high doses, is a relatively benign substance, and is

not nearly as detrimental as other legalized substances such as

alcohol and tobacco.  Given these factors, there is no compelling

state interest which would justify the state's infringement upon

appellant's use of marijuana in the free exercise of his religion.

     In conclusion, the final passage of Woody speaks to the

importance of preserving the right to free religious expression:

          We know that some will urge that it is more
     important to subserve the rigorous enforcement of
     narcotic laws than to carve out of them an exception for
     a few believers in a strange faith.  They will say that
     the exception may produce problems of enforcement and
     that the dictate of the state must overcome the beliefs
     of a minority of Indians.  But the problems of
     enforcement here do not inherently differ from those of
     other situations which call for the detection of fraud.
     On the other hand, the right to free religious expression
     embodies a precious heritage of our history.  In a mass
     society, which presses at every point toward conformity,
     the protection of self-expression, however unique, of the
     individual and the group becomes ever more important.
     The varying currents of the subcultures that flow into
     the mainstream of our national life give it depth and
     beauty. . . .

(Woody, supra, 61 Cal.2d 716, 727-728.)

<HR>                          CONCLUSION

     Although the appellant was found guilty of possessing

marijuana for purposes of sale, the evidence presented at trial

demonstrated that appellant had no intent to sell the marijuana he

had obtained.  Rather, the marijuana was to be given away as a

sacrament.  Hence, the judgment of conviction should be vacated.

     Further, the trial court acknowledged that the appellant

sincerely adheres to a religion which considers marijuana to be a

sacrament as well as an actual object of worship, and that the

appellant's "religious practices may be constitutionally

protected."  Nevertheless, the trial court convicted appellant for

illegal commercial activity, i.e., possessing and transporting

marijuana.  The court thus "side-stepped" the freedom of religion

issue.  Appellant's constitutional right to free exercise of

religion through the partaking of the sacrament is meaningless

without the right to possess and transport that sacrament.  Thus,

the First Amendment issues presented in this case must be remanded

for a determination of whether there is some compelling state

interest which would justify the burden placed on appellant's

religious freedoms.

     Finally, the terms of probation prohibiting the appellant from

associating with anyone who uses marijuana effectively prevent

appellant from associating with his church brethren.  This issue

must also be remanded for a determination regarding any compelling

state interest which would justify the burden on the appellant's

First Amendment rights.

<STRONG>Judge Ruth Bader Ginsberg-<BR>
So much for the First Amendment<P>

<A HREF="mailto:mikuriya@igc.apc.org">Tod Mikuriya</A><P>


In a Court of Appeals ruling on June 20, 1989, in Carl Eric Olsen vs. Drug Enforcement Administration: Olsen, a priest of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, sought federal approval for church members to use marijuana as a religious sacrament. The court of appeals ruled against Olsen in an opinion written by Ginsburg.<P>

'We hold that the First Amendment's free exercise of religion guarantee does not require the requested exception, and that petitioner (0lsen) was not denied equal protection-establishment clause rights by the government's refusal."<P>  

Ginsberg displays her adherence to a bigoted consensus excluding the use of cannabis as a religious sacrament. She joins the collective denial of the judiciary despite extensive evidence of cannabis use in the Hindu and other religions. A Jew sold out to the pharaohs. Capo for the state.<P>

"We conclude that the DEA cannot accommodate Olsen's religious use of marijuana without unduly burdening or disrupting enforcement of the federal marijuana laws."<P> 

She unwittingly acknowledges Olsen's religious motivation for using marijuana. She then affirms and rationalizes his persecution. The grounds: inability of the vast DEA organization to accommodate are "burdening and disrupting". Ginsberg, state religious persecutor.<P>

Judge Ruth Bader Ginsberg bares her view of the state and the individual which is clearly authoritarian, and will guarantee the continuation of the erosion of civil rights by the supreme court.</STRONG>

     Non-Indian member of Native American church was indicted for 
importing peyote through mail and possessing it with intent to 
distribute.  He moved to dismiss.  The District Court, Burciaga, 
Chief Judge, held that: (1) permitting Indians' nondrug use of 
peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of Native American 
church, but prohibiting such use by non-Indians, would violate 
free exercise and equal protection clauses; (2) compelling 
interest test applied to free exercise challenge to prosecution

MEMORANDUM OPINION

</pre>

<pre> 
     BURCIAGA, Chief Judge.

<pre> 
     THERE is a genius to our Constitution.  Its genius is that 
it speaks to the freedoms of the individual.  It is this genius 
that brings the present matter before the Court.  More 
specifically, this matter concerns a freedom that was a natural 
idea whose genesis was in the Plymouth Charter, and finds its 
present form in the First Amendment to the United States 
Constitution -- the freedom of religion. 
 
     The Government's &quot;war on drugs&quot; has become a wildfire that 
threatens to consume those fundamental rights of the individual 
deliberately enshrined in our Constitution.  Ironically, as we 
celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, the 
tattered Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable 
searches and seizures and the now frail Fifth Amendment right 
against self-incrimination or deprivation of liberty without due 
process have fallen as casualties in this &quot;war on drugs.&quot;  It was 
naive of this Court to hope that this erosion of constitutional 
protections would stop at the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  But 
today, the &quot;war&quot; targets one of the most deeply held fundamental 
rights -- the First Amendment right to freely exercise one's 
religion. 
 
     To us in the Southwest, this freedom of religion has 
singular significance because it affects diverse cultures.  It is 
as much of us as the rain on our hair, the wind on the grass, and 
the sun on our faces.  It is so naturally a part of us that when 
the joy of this beautiful freedom sings in our souls, we find it 
hard to conceive that it could ever be imperiled.  Yet, today, in 
this land of bright blue skies and yellow grass, of dusty 
prairies and beautiful mesas, and vistas of red earth with walls 
of weathered rock, eroded by oceans of time, the free spirit of 
the individual once again is threatened by the arrogance of 
Government. 
 
     The issue presented is the recurring conflict between the 
Native American Church members' right to freely exercise their 
religion through the ceremonial use of peyote and the 
Government's efforts to eradicate illegal drugs.  To the 
Government, peyote is a dangerous hallucinogen.  To Robert Boyll, 
peyote is both a sacrament and a deity essential to his religion.  
But this matter concerns competing interests greater than those 
relating to this small, spineless cactus having psychedelic 
properties.  It draws forth a troublesome constitutional conflict 
which arises from fundamentally different perspectives of peyote. 
 
     In its &quot;war&quot; to free our society of the devastating effects 
of drugs, the Government slights its duty to observe the 
fundamental freedom of individuals to practice the religion of 
their choice, regardless of race.  Simply put, the Court is faced 
with the quintessential constitutional conflict between an 
inalienable right upon which this

country, was founded and the response by the Government to the 
swelling political passions of the day.  In this fray, the Court 
is compelled to halt this menacing attack on our constitutional 
freedoms. 
 
     On May 10, 1990, the Federal Grand Jury indicted Robert 
Lawrence Boyll, a non-Native American, for unlawfully importing 
through the United States mail and possessing peyote with the 
intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  952(a), 
960(b)(3), 843(b) &amp; (c), &amp; 841(a)(1) (1981).  The three-count 
indictment arose out of Mr. Boyll mailing himself a quantity of 
peyote front Mexico to his home in San Cristobal, New Mexico. 
 
     In his motions to dismiss, Mr. Boyll argues that the 
indictment violates his First Amendment right to freely exercise 
his religion.  Mr. Boyll also claims that, pursuant to 21 C.F.R. 
 1307.31 (1990), the listing of peyote as a controlled substance 
does not apply to him because he is a member of the Native 
American Church and he imported and possessed peyote for use in 
bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native American Church. 
 
     The United States adopts a racially restrictive reading of 
21 C.F.R.  1307.31, arguing that the protection contained 
therein applies only to members of the Native American Church who 
are American Indians.  It claims that Mr. Boyll cannot be a 
member of the Native American Church because &quot;membership is 
limited to persons who [sic] ethnic descent is at least twenty-
five percent derived from American Indian stock, and to the 
spouses of such persons&quot;; that, therefore, Mr. Boyll cannot be a 
member of the Native American Church since neither he nor his 
spouse is twenty-five percent American Indian. 
 
     The Court held an evidentiary hearing in this matter on 
October 18, 1990.  It immediately became apparent that an 
examination and understanding of the history and present 
structure of the Peyote Religion and the Native American Church, 
as well as of 21 C.F.R.  1307.31, is essential to a faithful 
resolution of the issues presented by Mr. Boyll's motions.

<pre> 
     The following will constitute the Court's findings of fact 
and conclusions of law. 
</pre>

<pre> 
     The peyote plant is a small, spineless cactus having 
psychedelic properties and the experience of eating it is central 
to the Peyote Religion. [footnote 1]  Unlike traditional 
religions which have sacramental symbols such as bread and wine, 
peyote is more than a sacrament to members of the Native American 
Church.  Peyote is, itself, considered a deity which cannot be 
owned by any individual.  Peyote is worshipped and eaten at a 
religious ceremony called a peyote meeting.  &quot;Peyote is a sacred 
medicine; peyote protects; peyote allows one to see the future, 
or to find lost objects; peyote gives power to the user that may 
be manifest in various ways; peyote teaches; peyote may be used 
by Christians or may be incorporated with Christian ideas; a 
pilgrimage to gather peyote plants is viewed as an act of piety 
to be undertaken if possible....&quot;  Omer C. Stewart [footnote 2], 
Peyote Religion 41 (1987).  It is considered sacrilegious to use 
peyote for nonreligious purposes. 
 
     The peyote ceremony is unique and the very cornerstone of 
the Peyote Religion.  It is always conducted by individuals who 
hold honored posts which have specially assigned duties.  The 
leader of the ceremony is called a &quot;roadman.&quot;  The roadman is 
responsible for initiating the participants, although worshipers 
who are not personally invited are usually welcomed as well.

  [footnote 2]  Mr. Omer C. Stewart testified at the 
  evidentiary hearing in this case.  He is a distinguished 
  scholar of the Peyote Religion.  The Court found his 
  testimony invaluable.  Many of the Court's findings of fact 
  relating to the Peyote Religion and the Native American 
  Church can be attributed to Professor Stewart's testimony 
  and his well-known book on the subject which was admitted

include the chief drummer, who sits on the right of the roadman; 
the cedarman, who sits on the left of the roadman and sprinkles 
sagebrush &quot;incense&quot; on the fire; and the fireman or doorman, who 
tends the fire and sits near the opening of the teepee.  Each 
meeting also has a sponsor who is responsible for securing a 
site, the roadman, the teepee and other materials necessary for 
the service.  Although not all ceremonies of the Native American 
Church are identical, the general concepts have been so well 
defined, so established in traditional practice, that they have 
not changed significantly for nearly a hundred years.  Peyote 
Religion at 36, 339-75.  At these peyote meetings, the worshipers 
usually gather in a teepee at dusk and the ceremony passes 
through a series of ritualistic stages.  During these rituals, a 
staff and a rattle are passed around and the person who receives 
them leads in singing peyote hymns and prayer.  Around midnight, 
peyote is ingested by the worshipers and the singing, praying and 
drumming continues throughout the night until dawn.  When the 
&quot;buttons&quot; of the plant are eaten, or brewed into tea and imbibed, 
the user experiences hallucinations.  The peyote plant produces 
&quot;a warm and pleasant euphoria, an agreeable point of view, 
relaxation, colorful visual distortions, and a sense of 
timelessness that are conducive to the all-night ceremony of the 
Native American Church.&quot;  Peyote Religion at 3.  Finally, at noon 
of the following day, all worshipers share in a ceremonial feast.  
See generally Peyote Religion at 327-336 (description of peyote 
ritual); T. Hillerman, People of Darkness 153 (1980) (description 
of Navajo peyote ritual). 
 
     The Native American Church combines elements of Christianity 
with traditional Native American beliefs and the sacramental use 
of peyote.  Peyote Religion at 33; Toledo v. Nobel-Sysco, Inc., 
892 F.2d 1481, 1485 (10th Cir.1989), cert. denied, --- U.S. ---, 
110 S.Ct. 2208, 109 L.Ed.2d 535 (1990).  Although the religious 
use of peyote has existed for centuries, the Peyote Religion's 
corporate form, the Native American Church, was established in 
Oklahoma in 1918.  At that time, the leaders of the Peyote 
Religion reasoned that an &quot;incorporated&quot; church would provide 
greater protection from early attempts to suppress the use of 
peyote for religious purposes. 
 
     While the Oklahoma Chapter of the Native American Church is 
sentimentally referred to as the Mother Church, no single branch 
speaks for the numerous branches throughout the United States.  
Unlike more traditional churches, the Native American Church is a 
non-hierarchical church and has no central organization which 
dictates church policy.  The Native American Church consists of a 
number of loosely affiliated local chapters.  Each chapter is 
responsible for establishing its own charter, if it so chooses.  
&quot;Each congregation makes its own rules, just as each meeting is 
conducted by its own roadman.&quot;  Peyote Religion at 334.  
Nevertheless, the teachings of all the Native American Church 
chapters are essentially the same. 
 
     &quot;Church&quot; refers to a body of believers and their shared 
practices, rather than the existence of a formal structure or a 
membership roll.  Membership in the Native American Church 
derives from the sincerity of one's beliefs and participation in 
its ceremonies.  Historically, the church has been hospitable to 
and, in fact, has proselytized non-Indians.  The vast majority of 
Native American Church congregations, like most conventional 
congregations, maintains an &quot;open door&quot; policy and does not 
exclude persons on the basis of their race.  Racial restrictions 
to membership have never been a general part of Peyote Religion 
or of the Native American Church. See Peyote Religion at 333-34; 
State v. Whittingham, 19 Ariz.App. 27, 28, 504 P.2d 950, 951 
(1973) (membership to non-Indians is usually not refused), review 
denied, 110 Ariz. 279, 517 P.2d 1275, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 946, 
94 S.Ct. 3071, 41 L.Ed.2d 667 (1974).  Although one branch of the 
Native American Church, the Native American Church of North 
America, is known to restrict membership to Native Americans, 
most other branches of the Native American Church do not.  As a 
result, non-Indian

members are accepted within the Native American Church. [footnote 
3] 
 
     Since attending his first ceremony of the Native American 
Church at Taos, New Mexico, in 1981, Mr. Boyll has been, and 
continues to be, an active member of the Native American Church.  
In fact, while living in Mill Valley, California, from 1981 until 
1989, Mr. Boyll participated in ceremonies of the Native American 
Church an average of once every two to three weeks.  Mr.  Boyll 
often sponsored these meetings or participated as a drummer, 
cedarman or fireman.  He sincerely believes in the teachings and 
practices of the Native American Church. [footnote 4]  He has 
only used peyote in connection with bona fide religious purposes 
and has never been excluded from the Native American Church 
because of his non-Indian race. 
 
     In 1989, motivated in part by his commitment to the Native 
American Church, Mr. Boyll moved to New Mexico.  He continues his 
active participation in meetings of Native American Church 
congregations in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado.  
During one specific peyote meeting, Mr. Boyll was explicitly 
recognized as a member of the Native American Church by 
Rutherford Loneman, a well-known roadman who is also a former 
Vice-Chairman of the Native American Church in Oklahoma.  Yet, 
Mr. Boyll has always considered himself a member of the Native 
American Church rather than of a specific branch. 
 
     The act of traveling to the place where peyote is harvested 
is considered an act of piety which has its own rewards.  The 
long, sacred pilgrimage to harvest peyote is considered to be one 
of the most important aboriginal traditions of the Peyote 
Religion.  Peyote Religion at 31-32 (&quot;When the [peyote]-seekers 
arrive [back] at their homes, the people turn out to welcome the 
plants with music, and a festival....&quot;).  Peyote is grown only in 
northern Mexico and the Rio Grande Valley of southern Texas.  
Peyote is not grown anywhere else and its growth area, especially 
in the United States, is being considerably depleted.  Peyote 
Religion at 334-35. 
 
     Because the peyote fields in Texas are depleted, Mr. Boyll 
went on a &quot;pilgrimage&quot; to Mexico to obtain peyote for himself and 
members of the congregations with whom he worships.  From Mexico, 
Mr. Boy11 mailed the peyote to his post office box in San 
Cristobal, New Mexico, to avoid violating Texas law, which 
restricts religious possession and use of peyote only to Native 
Americans.  See Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Anno.  481.111 (Vernon 
1989).  On April 27, 1990, Mr. Boyll picked up the parcel of 
peyote from the post office in San Cristobal, New Mexico.  He was 
on his way to deliver the peyote to Tellus Goodmorning, an elder 
of the Taos Pueblo and nationally respected roadman, when he was 
arrested. 
 
     The Court will first address whether 21 C.F.R.  1307.21 
applies to all sincere menders of the Native American Church, in-

Stated differently, does the federal exemption place a racial

<pre> 
     [1]  As far back as the late 18th century, efforts were 
being made to restrict the ceremonial use of peyote.  See Peyote 
Religion at 128-147.  However, not until the popularity of 
psychedelic drugs in the 1960's did Congress restrict the 
possession, consumption and sale of peyote.  See Drug Abuse 
Control Amendments of 1965, 79 Stat. 226  3(a).  Thereafter, for 
the first time, peyote was classified as a Schedule I controlled 
substance.  See Controlled Substance Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C.  
812(c), Schedule I(c)(12).  But Congress never intended to 
prohibit the ceremonial use of peyote.  See Kennedy v. Bureau of 
Narcotics &amp; Dangerous Drugs, 459 F.2d 415, 419 (9th Cir.1972), 
cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1115, 93 S.Ct. 901, 34 L.Ed.2d 699 (1973);

69, 73-74, 394 P.2d 813, 817-18 (1964).  In implementing 
regulations, Congress exempted the religious use of peyote by 
members of the Native American Church.  See 11 Cong.Rec. 14608, 
15977 (1965); see also Native American Church, 468 F.Supp. at 
1249-50; Peyote Way Church of God, lnc. v. Smith, 742 F.2d 193,

regulation relating to the listing of peyote as a controlled 
substance provides:

     The listing of peyote as a controlled substance 
  [under federal law) does not apply to the nondrug 
  use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of 
  the Native American Church, and members of the 
  Native American Church so using peyote are exempt 
  from registration.

21 C.F.R.  1307.31.  As many as three states have similar 
statutory or judicially crafted exemptions in their drug laws for 
the religious use of peyote.  N.M.Stat.Ann.  30-31-6(D)

65-4116(c)(8) (1985); Utah Code Ann.  58-37-3(3) (1986). 
 
     &quot;The language of a regulation or statute is the starting 
point for its interpretation.&quot;  Dyer v. United States, 832 F.2d 
1062, 1066 (9th Cir.1987) (citing Consumer Product Safety Comm'n 
v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 
64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980)).  &quot;The plain meaning governs unless a 
clearly expressed legislative intent is to the contrary.&quot;  Id.  
&quot;When we find the terms of a statute unambiguous, judicial 
inquiry is complete.&quot;  Rubin v. United States, 449 U.S. 424, 430, 
101 S.Ct. 698, 701-02, 66 L.Ed.2d 633 (1981); see also, e.g., 
Wilson v. Stocker, 819 F.2d 943, 948 (10th Cir.1987). 
 
     The language of 21 C.F.R.  1307.31 is clear, unambiguous 
and wholly consistent with the regulation's history and purpose.  
The plain language of 21 C.F.R.  1307.31 exempts all worshipers 
engaged &quot;in bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native American 
Church.&quot;  The regulation plainly declares Congress' purpose to 
exempt Native American Church members.  Nowhere is it even 
suggested that the exemption applies only to Indian members of 
the Native American Church.  Had the intent been to exclude non-
Indian members, as the United States argues, the language of the 
exemption would have so clearly provided.  Indeed, the federal 
peyote exemption makes no reference whatsoever to a racial 
exclusion.  Compare 21 C.F.R.  1307-31 &amp; N.M.Stat.Ann. 30-31-
6(D) (Supp.1989) with Tex.Health &amp; Safety Code Anno.  481.111 
(Vernon 1989) (including the language &quot;[t]he exemption granted to 
members of the Native American Church under this section does not 
apply to a member with less than 25 percent Indian Blood&quot;).  The 
plain language of the federal peyote exemption applies to all 
members of the Native American Church, regardless of race.  Cf.

(rejecting the Government's proposed racial reading of the

different interest in protecting the health of Indians than it

     A racially neutral reading of the exemption is consistent 
not only with the racially neutral language of the exemption but 
also with its legislative history.  During hearings on the 
Controlled Substances Act of 1970, a representative of the Bureau 
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, presently the Drug Enforcement 
Agency, explained the rationale for the special exemption and 
assured Congress that the exemption would not be affected by the 
new legislation: 
</pre>

<pre> 
  We consider the Native American Church to be sui 
  generis.  The history and tradition of the church 
  is such that there is no question but that they 
  regard peyote as a deity as it were, and we will 
  continue the exemption.  (emphasis added).

Native American Church, 468 F.Supp. at 1251 (quoting Drug Abuse 
Control Amendments of 1970, Hearing before the Subcommittee on 
Public Health &amp; Welfare of the Committee on Interstate and 
Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 
117-18 (1970)).  Clearly, the nature and history of the Native 
American Church played a significant role in the promulgation of 
21 C.F.R.  1307.31.  As the uncontradicted evidence in this case 
shows, the history of the Native American Church attests to the 
fact that non-Indian worshipers have always been, and continue to 
be, active and sincere members of the Native American Church. 
 
     The Government's racially restrictive reading and 
application of the exemption reveals a fundamental 
misunderstanding of the history and present structure of the 
Native American Church.  Indeed, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration's own rationale acknowledges that the exemption is 
not based on the racial makeup of the Native American Church 
membership.  See Olsen v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 878 F.2d 1458, 
1465-1468 (D.C.Cir.1989) (final order of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration in connection with the exemption makes no mention 
of any distinction between Indian and non-Indian members of the 
Native American Church).  While there may exist some legitimate 
support for the argument that Congress never intended to extend 
the exemption to non-Native American Church members, see Peyote 
Way Church of God, Inc. v. Thornburgh, 922 F.2d 1210 (5th 
Cir.1991); but see Native American Church, 468 F.Supp. at 1249-
51, the plain language of the exemption and the legislative 
history clearly support this Court's finding that Congress 
intended the exemption to apply to all members of the Native 
American Church, Indian and non-Indian alike. 
 
     The Court also finds persuasive Mr. Boyll's argument that to 
construe the racially neutral language of the exemption &quot;to 
provide only racially discriminatory protection would place the 
exemption unnecessarily in direct conflict with the first 
amendment.&quot;  Such a consequence would, at the very least, violate 
the canon of statutory construction that &quot;[f]ederal statutes are 
to be construed as to avoid serious doubts of their 
constitutionality.&quot;  Int'l Ass'n of Machinists v. Street, 367

     [2]  The Court will next address the constitutional question 
of whether the indictment violates Mr. Boyll's First Amendment

<pre> 
religious freedom through the imposition of a racial exclusion -- 
does not give rise to valid constitutional concerns.  Since the 
use of peyote by Native American Church members is the very 
essence of their religious beliefs, the proposed racially 
restrictive reading of 21 C.F.R.  1307.31 would have the sure 
effect of imposing a racial exclusion to membership in the Native 
American Church itself.  To exclude individuals of a particular 
race from being members of a recognized religious faith is 
offensive to the very heart of the First Amendment.  See Walz v. 
Tax Comm'n of New York, 397 U.S. 664, 668-69, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 
1411-12, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) (the First Amendment's 
Establishment Clause ensures that governmental interference with 
religion will not be tolerated).  In fact, there can be no more 
excessive entanglement of Government with religion than the 
Government's attempt to impose a racial restriction to membership 
in a religious organization.  The decision as to who can and who 
cannot be members of the Native American Church is an internal 
church judgment which the First Amendment shields from 
governmental interference.  Cf. Paul v. Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract 
Society, 819 F.2d 875, 878, n. 1. (9th Cir.) (constitutionally 
improper for government to resolve a dispute about religious 
doctrine or practices), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 926, 108 S.Ct. 
289, 98 L.Ed.2d 249 (1987).  It is one thing for a local branch 
of the Native American Church to adopt its own restrictions on 
membership, but it is entirely another for the Government to 
restrict membership in a religious organization on the basis of 
race.  Any such attempt to restrict religious liberties along 
racial lines would not only be a contemptuous affront to the 
First Amendment guarantee of freedom of religion but also to the 
Fourteenth Amendment right to equal justice under the law. 
 
     Applying the above-mentioned canon of statutory 
construction, we find that the United States' racially 
restrictive reading of 21 C.F.R.  1307.31 does raise the sort of 
&quot;grave and doubtful constitutional questions,&quot; United States v. 
Delaware &amp; Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408, 29 S.Ct. 527, 535, 53 
L.Ed. 836 (1909), that would lead this Court to assume Congress 
did not intend such an interpretation.  Federal Trade Comm'n v. 
American Tobacco Co., 264 U.S. 298, 305-307, 44 S.Ct. 336, 337-
338, 68 L.Ed. 696 (1924) (assuming Congress legislates in the 
light of constitutional limitations). 
 
     The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment provides 
that &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of 
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging 
of freedom, ... or the right of the people to assemble....&quot;  U.S. 
Const.Amend. I.  While the freedom to act upon religious beliefs 
is not absolute, &quot;only those interests of the highest order and 
those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to 
the free exercise of religion.&quot;  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 
205, 215, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1533, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972).  Traditional 
free exercise jurisprudence has long held that in order for 
government to substantially burden religiously motivated conduct, 
Government must justify such restrictions by a compelling state 
interest and use means narrowly tailored to achieve that 
interest.  See Hernandez v. Commisioner, 490 U.S. 680, 699, 109 
S.Ct. 2136, 2148-49, 104 L.Ed.2d 766 (1989); United States v. 
Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 257-58, 102 S.Ct. 1051, 1055-56, 71 L.Ed.2d 
127 (1982); Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Secur. 
Div., 450 U.S. 707, 717-19, 101 S.Ct 1425, 1431-32, 67 L.Ed.2d 
624 (1981); Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 403, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 
1793-94, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963). 
 
     In order for government action to withstand a challenge 
under the Free Exercise Clause, the action must satisfy the two-
step analysis of the compelling interest test.  The Court must 
first determine whether the Government's action &quot;imposes any 
burden on the free exercise of [defendant]'s religion.&quot;  
Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 403, 83 S.Ct. at 1794.  Then, if such 
burden exists, the Court must &quot;consider whether some compelling 
state interest ... justifies the substantial infringement of 
[defendant]'s First Amendment right.&quot;  Id. at 406, 83 S.Ct. at 
1795.  &quot;The compelling

interest test reflects the First Amendment's mandate of 
preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a 
pluralistic society.&quot;  Employment Division, Dept. of Human 
Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 1613, 
108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990) (O'Connor, J., concurring). 
</pre>

<pre> 
     [3]  Recently, the Supreme Court in Employment Division, 
Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 
S.Ct. 1595, 1603, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990) [&quot;Smith&quot;], elected to 
abandon the compelling interest test in cases involving a 
&quot;neutral, generally applicable [criminal] law,&quot; reasoning that 
the application of such a statute does not implicate First 
Amendment concerns.  Accordingly, without the benefit of any 
constitutional scrutiny at all, the Court held that Oregon's 
across-the-board prohibition against peyote was constitutional. 
</pre>

<pre> 
     [4]  This Court is convinced that 21 C.F.R.  1307.31 is 
&quot;specifically directed to religious practices and therefore not 
within the ambit of Smith.&quot;  Salvation Army v. Dept. of Community 
Affairs of State of New Jersey, 919 F.2d 183, 194, 204 (3d 
Cir.1990) (Becker, J., concurring).  The Drug Enforcement Agency 
regulation in the present case, unlike the statute in Smith, is 
neither neutral nor generally applicable.  Indeed, the plain 
language of the exemption speaks directly to &quot;bona fide religious 
ceremonies of the Native American Church.&quot;  Therefore, this Court 
will proceed to apply the traditional compelling interest test.  
See Cf. Id. 110 S.Ct. at 1603 (&quot;where the [Government] has in 
place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to 
extend that system to cases of 'religious hardships' without 
compelling reason&quot;). 
 
     With respect to the first step of the analysis, it is 
uncontradicted that the racially restrictive interpretation of 21 
C.F.R.  1307.31 would impose a substantial burden on Mr. Boyll's 
free exercise of religion.  On this issue, the Court's findings 
of fact and conclusions of law are not very different from those 
in Woody, 40 Cal.Rptr. at 72, 74, 394 P.2d at 816, 618, which 
concluded: 
</pre>

<pre> 
  An examination of the record as to the nature of 
  peyote and its role in the religion practiced by 
  defendants as [Indian and non-Indian] members of 
  the Native American Church ... compels the 
  conclusion that the [racially restrictive] 
  prohibition most seriously infringes upon the 
  observance of the religion. 
</pre>

<pre> 
     .... 
</pre>

<pre> 
  The record thus establishes that the [indictment 
  for] ... the use of peyote results in a virtual 
  inhibition of the practice of defendants' 
  religion. 
</pre>

<pre> 
Id.  Indian and non-Indian &quot;believers who worship at the Native 
American Church cannot freely exercise their religious beliefs 
absent the use of peyote.&quot;  Whittingham, 19 Ariz.App. at 29, 504 
P.2d at 952.  &quot;There is no dispute that [the] criminal 
prohibition of peyote places a severe burden on the ability of 
[Defendant] to freely exercise [his] religion.&quot;  Smith 110 S.Ct. 
at 1613 (O'Connor, J., concurring); Peyote Way Church of God, 742 
F.2d at 200-01.  Additionally, the Court finds that Mr. Boyll's 
trip to Mexico to obtain peyote is an integral part of the Peyote 
Religion practiced by the Native American Church.  Such a 
substantial infringement necessarily triggers further First 
Amendment scrutiny. 
 
     The Court must next &quot;consider whether some compelling 
[governmental] interest ... justifies the substantial 
infringement of [defendant]'s First Amendment right.&quot;  Sherbert, 
374 U.S. at 406, 83 S.Ct. at 1795.  While the Court is well aware 
that drug abuse is &quot;one of the greatest problems affecting the 
health and welfare of our population&quot; and, thus, &quot;one of the most 
serious problems confronting our society today,&quot; National 
Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 668, 674, 109 
S.Ct. 1384, 1392, 1395, 103 L.Ed.2d 685 (1989), this amorphous 
problem, without more, cannot justify the serious infringement on 
the observance of religion. 
</pre>

<pre> 
     First, the United States has failed to present any evidence 
of a compelling interest to justify its actions in the present 
case. 
</pre>

<hr>

<p>1342 <br>
774 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT </p>

<pre> 
&quot;In the absence of evidence, we cannot simply assume that the 
psychedelic is so baneful that its use must be prohibited to a 
group of [non-Indian] members but poses no equal threat when used 
by [Indian] members of the Native American Church.&quot;  Peyote Way 
Church of God, 742 F.2d at 201.  In fact, in light of the absence 
of factual support and the scarcity of legal support for the 
United States' opposition to Defendant's motions to dismiss, this 
Court cannot help but believe that the present prosecution is, at 
best, an overreaction driven by political passions or, at worst, 
influenced by religious and racial insensitivity, if not outright 
hostility. 
 
     Finally, the existence of 21 C.F.R.  1307.31 itself, 
negates the existence of a compelling governmental interest in 
prosecuting non-Indian members of the Native American Church for 
their religious use of peyote.  Id. (&quot;The exemption granted both 
by federal and [state] law to the ritual use of peyote by the 
Native American Church tends ... to negate the existence of a 
compelling [governmental] interest in the same use of it&quot;).  
Indeed, the federal exemption explicitly establishes a 
governmental interest in preserving the exemption of peyote as a 
controlled substance for its ritual use by Indian and non-Indian 
members of the Native American Church.  The only compelling 
interest in the present case is Congress' considered and 
continued conviction that the use of peyote in the Native 
American Church is the kind of free exercise of religion the 
First Amendment protects.  See, e.g., Native American Church, 468 
F.Supp. at 1249-50; Peyote Religion, 128-147.  Finding no 
compelling interest to justify the constitutional infringement at 
issue, the Court need not reach the often critical question of 
balancing two competing interests. 
 
     Congress has articulated an unequivocal federal policy 
protecting the right of the Native American Church and its 
members to worship, possess and use peyote in bona fide religious 
ceremonies.  This policy arises out of our country's recognition 
of the importance of individual freedom.  For, 
</pre>

<pre> 
  the right to free religious expression embodies a 
  precious heritage of our history.  In a mass society, 
  which presses at every point toward conformity, the 
  protection of a self-expression, however unique, of 
  the individual and the group become ever more 
  important.  The varying currents of the subcultures 
  that flow into the mainstream of our national life 
  give it depth and beauty. 
</pre>

<pre> 
Woody, 40 Cal.Rptr. at 77, 394 P.2d at 821; see also 111 
Cong.Rec. 15977 (1965).  The court in Woody eloquently speaks to 
the freedom of the individual. 
 
     Individual freedom, whether it be freedom of religion, 
expression or association, has been particularly important to 
maintaining the culturally diverse character of New Mexico.  
Here, we celebrate the right of the individual to revel in the 
passions of the spirit.  The survival of this right owes much to 
the protection afforded by the First Amendment, which has allowed 
New Mexico's distinct cultures to learn mutual respect for each 
other's jealously-guarded customs and traditions.  Diversity is 
New Mexico's enchantment. 
 
     For the reasons set out in this Memorandum Opinion and 
Order, the Court holds that, pursuant to 21 C.F.R.  1307.31 
(1990), the classification of peyote as a Schedule I controlled 
substance, see 21 U.S.C.  812(c), Schedule I(c)(12), does not 
apply to the importation, possession or use of peyote for bona 
fide ceremonial use by members of the Native American Church, 
regardless of race. 
</pre>

<pre> 
     Wherefore, 
</pre>

<pre> 
     IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Defendant Robert 
Boyll's motions to dismiss the indictment be and hereby are 
GRANTED.

<h3>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT OF 1993</h3>

<pre>
An Act 
To protect the free exercise of religion. 
	Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1, SHORT TITLE. 
	This Act may be cited as the &quot;Religious Freedom Restoration 
Act of 1993&quot;. 
SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES. 
	(a) FINDINGS.---The Congress finds--- 
	(1) the framers of the Constitution, recognizing free 
exercise of religion as an unalienable right, secured its 
protection in the First Amendment to the Constitution; 
	(2) laws &quot;neutral&quot; toward religion may burden religious 
exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious 
exercise; 
	(3) governments should not substantially burden religious 
exercise without compelling justification; 
	(4) in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990) the 
Supreme Court virtually eliminated the requirement that the 
government justify burdens on religious exercise imposed by laws 
neutral toward religion; and 
	(5) the compelling interest test as set forth in prior 
Federal court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible 
balances between religious liberty and competing prior 
governmental interests. 
	(b) PURPOSES.---The purposes of this Act are--- 
	(1) to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in 
Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 
406 U.S. 205 (1972) and to guarantee its application in all cases 
where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened; and 
	(2) to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious 
exercise is substantially burdened by government. 
SEC. 3. FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION PROTECTED. 
	(a) IN GENERAL.---Government shall not substantially burden 
a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a 
rule of general applicability, except as provided in subsection 
(b). 
	(b) EXCEPTION.---Government may substantially burden a 
person's exercise of religion only if it determines that 
application of the burden to the person--- 
	(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; 
and 
	(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that 
compelling governmental interest. 
	(c) JUDICIAL RELIEF.---A person whose religious exercise has 
been burdened in violation of this section may assert that 
violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and 
obtain appropriate relief against a government.  Standing to 
assert a claim or defense under this section shall be governed by 
the general rules of standing under article III of the 
Constitution. 
SEC. 4. ATTORNEYS FEES. 
	(a) JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.---Section 722 of the Revised 
Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1988) is amended by 
inserting &quot;the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993,&quot; before 
&quot;or title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964&quot;. 
	(b) ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS.---Section 504(b)(1)(C) of 
title 5, United States Code, is amended--- 
	(1) by striking &quot;and&quot; at the end of clause (ii); 
	(2) by striking the semicolon at the end of clause (iii) and 
inserting &quot;;and&quot;; and 
	(3) by inserting &quot;(iv) the Religious Freedom Restoration Act 
of 1993&quot; after clause (iii). 
SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. 
	As used in this Act--- 
	(1) the term &quot;government includes a branch, department, 
agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting 
under color of law) of the United States, a State, or a 
subdivision of a State; 
	(2) the term &quot;State&quot; includes the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and each territory and possession of 
the United States; 
	(3) the term &quot;demonstrates&quot; means meets the burden of going 
forward with the evidence and of persuasion; and 
	(4) the term &quot;exercise of religion&quot; means exercise of 
religion under the First Amendment to the Constitution. 
SEC. 6. APPLICABILITY. 
	(a) IN GENERAL.---This Act applies to all Federal and State 
law, and the implementation of that law, whether statutory or 
otherwise, and whether adopted before or after the enactment of 
the Act. 
	(b) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.---Federal statutory law adopted 
after the date of the enactment of this Act is subject to this 
Act unless such law explicitly excludes such application by 
reference to this Act. 
	(c) RELIGIOUS BELIEF UNAFFECTED.---Nothing in this Act shall 
be construed to authorize any government to burden any religious 
belief. 
SEC. 7. ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE UNAFFECTED. 
	Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect, interpret, 
or in any way address that portion of the First Amendment 
prohibiting laws respecting the establishment of religion 
(referred to in this section as the &quot;Establishment Clause&quot;).  
Granting government funding, benefits, or exemptions, to the 
extent permissible under the Establishment Clause of the First 
Amendment, shall not constitute a violation of this Act.  As used 
in this section, the term &quot;granting&quot;, used with respect to  
government funding, benefits, or exemptions, does not include a 
denial of government funding, benefits, or exemptions. 
	Approved November 16, 1993.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
  This Act may be cited as the &quot;American Indian Religious Free- 
dom Act Amendments of 1994&quot;. 
SEC. 2. TRADITIONAL INDIAN RELIGIOUS USE OF THE PEYOTE 
      SACRAMENT. 
  The Act of August 11, 1978 (42 U.S.C. 1996), commonly referred 
to as the &quot;American Indian Religious Freedom Act&quot;, is amended 
by adding at the end thereof the following new section: 
  &quot;SEC. 3. (a) The Congress finds and declares that-- 
      &quot;(1) for many Indian people, the traditional ceremonial 
   use of the peyote cactus as a religious sacrament has for cen- 
   turies been integral to a way of life, and significant in 
   perpetuating Indian tribes and cultures; 
      &quot;(2) since 1965, this ceremonial use of peyote by Indians 
   has been protected by Federal regulation; 
      &quot;(3) while at least 28 States have enacted laws which 
   are similar to, or are in conformance with, the Federal regula- 
   tion which protects the ceremonial use of peyote by Indian 
   religious practitioners, 22 States have not done so, and this 
   lack of uniformity has created hardship for Indian people who 
   participate in such religious ceremonies; 
      &quot;(4) the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case 
   of Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), held 
   that the First Amendment does not protect Indian practitioners 
   who use peyote in Indian religious ceremonies, and also raised 
   uncertainty whether this religious practice would be protected 
   under the compelling State interest standard; and 
      &quot;(5) the lack of adequate and clear legal protection for 
   the religious use of peyote by Indians may serve to stigmatize 
   and marginalize Indian tribes and cultures, and increase the 
   risk that they will be exposed to discriminatory treatment. 
   &quot;(b)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the use, 
possession, or transportation of peyote by an Indian for bona fide 
traditional ceremonial purposes in connection with the practice 
of a traditional Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited 
by the United States or any State.  No Indian shall be penalized 
or discriminated against on the basis of such use, possession or

transportation, including, but not limited to, denial of otherwise 
applicable benefits under public assistance programs. 
  &quot;(2) This section does not prohibit such reasonable regulation 
and registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration of those 
persons who cultivate, harvest, or distribute peyote as may be 
consistent with the purposes of this Act. 
  &quot;(3) This section does not prohibit application of the provisions 
of section 481.111(a) of Vernon's Texas Health and Safety Code 
Annotated, in effect on the date of enactment of this section, insofar 
as those provisions pertain to the cultivation, harvest, and distribu- 
tion of peyote. 
  &quot;(4) Nothing in this section shall prohibit any Federal depart- 
ment or agency, in carrying out its statutory responsibilities and 
functions, from promulgating regulations establishing reasonable 
limitations on the use or ingestion of peyote prior to or during 
the performance of duties by sworn law enforcement officers or 
personnel directly involved in public transportation or any other 
safety-sensitive positions where the performance of such duties 
may be adversely affected by such use or ingestion.  Such regulations 
shall be adopted only after consultation with representatives of 
traditional Indian religions for which the sacramental use of peyote 
is integral to their practice.  Any regulation promulgated pursuant 
to this section shall be subject to the balancing test set forth 
in section 3 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 
103-141; 42 U.S.C. 2OOObb-1). 
  &quot;(5) This section shall not be construed as requiring prison 
authorities to permit, nor shall it be construed to prohibit prison 
authorities from permitting, access to peyote by Indians while incar- 
cerated within Federal or State prison facilities.

tion Act (Public Law 103-141; 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1), this section 
shall not be construed to prohibit States from enacting or enforcing 
reasonable traffic safety laws or regulations. 
  &quot;(7) Subject to the provisions of the Religious Freedom Restora-

does not prohibit the Secretary of Defense from promulgating regu- 
lations establishing reasonable limitations on the use, possession, 
transportation, or distribution of peyote to promote military readi- 
ness, safety, or compliance with international law or laws of other 
countries.  Such regulations shall be adopted only after consultation 
with representatives of traditional Indian religions for which the 
sacramental use of peyote is integral to their practice.

        AMERICAN INDIAN RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1994 
</pre>

<pre> 
AUGUST 5, 1994.--Committed to the Committee of the whole House on the 
State of the Union and ordered to be printed 
</pre>

<pre> 
Mr. MILLER of California, from the Committee on Natural Resources,  
submitted the following 
</pre>

<pre> 
REPORT 
[To accompany H.R. 4230] 
</pre>

<pre> 
[Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office] 
</pre>

<pre> 
  The Committee on Natural Resources, to whom was referred the bill (H.R.  
4230) to amend the American Indian Religious Freedom Act to provide for 
the traditional use of peyote by Indians for religious purposes, and for 
other purposes, having considered the same, report favorably thereon with 
an amendment and recommend that the bill as amended do pass. 
  The amendment is as follows: 
  Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the  
following: 
</pre>

<pre> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
  This Act may be cited as the &quot;American Indian Religious Freedom Act  
Amendments of 1994&quot;. 
</pre>

<pre> 
SEC. 2. TRADITIONAL INDIAN RELIGIOUS USE OF THE PEYOTE SACRAMENT. 
  The Act of August 11, 1978 (42 U.S.C. 1996), commonly referred to as 
the American Indian Religious Freedom Act&quot;, is amended by adding at the 
end thereof the following new section: 
  &quot;Sec. 3. (a) The Congress finds and declares that-- 
       &quot;(1) for many Indian people, the traditional ceremonial 
     use of the peyote cactus as a religious sacrament has for 
     centuries been integral to a way of life, and significant 
     in perpetuating Indian tribes and cultures; 
       (2) since 1965, this ceremonial use of peyote by Indians 
     has been protected by Federal regulation; 
       (3) while at least 28 States have enacted laws which are 
    similar to, or are in conformance with, the Federal 
    regulation which protects the ceremonial use of peyote by 
    Indian religious practitioners, 22 States have not done so, 
    and this lack of uniformity has created hardship for Indian 
    people who participate in such religious ceremonies;

</pre>

<pre> 
      &quot;(4) the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case 
    of Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), held 
    that the First Amendment does not protect Indian practitioners 
    who use peyote in Indian religious ceremonies, and also raised 
    uncertainty whether this religious practice would be protected 
    under the compelling State interest standard; and 
       &quot;(5) the lack of adequate and clear legal protection for 
    the religious use of peyote by Indians may serve to stigmatize 
    and marginalize Indian tribes and cultures, and increase the 
    risk that they will be exposed to discriminatory treatment. 
  &quot;(b)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the use, 
possession, or transportation of peyote by an Indian for bona fide 
traditional ceremonial purposes in connection with the practice 
of a traditional Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited 
by the United States or any State.  No Indian shall be penalized 
or discriminated against on the basis of such use, possession or 
transportation, including, but not limited to, denial of otherwise 
applicable benefits under public assistance programs. 
  &quot;(2) This section does not prohibit such reasonable regulation 
and registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration of those 
persons who cultivate, harvest, or distribute peyote as may be 
consistent with the purposes of this Act. 
  &quot;(3) This section does not prohibit application of the provisions 
of section 481.111(a) of Vernon's Texas Health and Safety Code 
Annotated, in effect on the date of enactment of this section, insofar 
as those provisions pertain to the cultivation, harvest, and distribu- 
tion of peyote. 
  &quot;(4 Nothing in this section shall prohibit any Federal depart- 
ment or agency, in carrying out its statutory responsibilities and 
functions, from promulgating regulations establishing reasonable 
limitations on the use or ingestion of peyote prior to or during 
the performance of duties by sworn law enforcement officers or 
personnel directly involved in public transportation or any other 
safety-sensitive positions where the performance of such duties 
may be adversely affected by such use or ingestion.  Such regulations 
shall be adopted only after consultation with representatives of 
traditional Indian religions for which the sacramental use of peyote 
is integral to their practice.  Any regulation promulgated pursuant 
to this section shall be subject to the balancing test set forth 
in section 3 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 
103-141; 42 U.S.C. 2OOObb-1). 
  &quot;(c) For purposes of this section-- 
        &quot;(1) the term 'Indian' means a member of an Indian tribe; 
        &quot;(2) the term 'Indian tribe' means any tribe, band, nation, 
    pueblo, or other organized group or community of Indians, 
    including any Alaska Native village (as defined in, or estab- 
    lished pursuant to, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 
    (43 U.S.C. l601 et seq.)), which is recognized as eligible for 
    the special programs and services provide by the United States 
    to Indians because of their status as Indians; 
        &quot;(3) the term 'Indian religion' means any religion-- 
              &quot;(A) which is practiced by Indians; and 
              &quot;(B) the origin and interpretation of which is from 
          within a traditional Indian culture or community; and 
        &quot;(4) the term 'State' means any State of the United States 
      and any political subdivision thereof. 
  &quot;(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed as abrogating, 
diminishing, or otherwise affecting-- 
              &quot;(1) the inherent rights of any Indian tribe; 
              &quot;(2) the rights, express or implicit, of any Indian 
            tribe which exist under treaties, Executive orders, and 
            laws of the United States; 
              &quot;(3) the inherent right of Indians to practice their 
            religions; and 
              &quot;(4) the right of Indians to practice their religions 
            under any Federal or State law.&quot;.

                           PURPOSE 
</pre>

<pre> 
  The purpose of H.R. 4230 is to amend the American Indian Religious  
Freedom Act to provide for the traditional use of peyote by Indians for  
religious purposes, and for other purposes.

<pre> 
                     BACKGROUND AND NEED 
</pre>

<pre> 
  Peyote, the scientific name of which is Lophophora williamsii, is a  
small, spineless cactus that grows only in the Rio Grande valley of  
southern Texas and northern Mexico.  Anthropologists date the sacramental  
use of the peyote cactus among indigenous peoples back 10,000 years.   
Native American religious use of peyote was discovered by Spanish 
explorers in the 1600's and has continued to the present.  Such use 
exists today, largely through the Native American Church (NAC), among 
more than 50 Indian tribes in the United States.  The NAC is the present-
day embodiment of one of the oldest religious traditions in the western 
hemisphere.  The contemporary NAC was first incorporated in Oklahoma in 
1918, and now has chapters in 25 States.  Approximately 250,000 American 
Indians are affiliated with the NAC. 
  The Federal District Court in New Mexico, in the 1986 case of Toledo v.  
Nobel-Sysco, Inc., 651 F.Supp. 483 (D.N.M. 1986) held that the religious  
use of peyote was not illegal.  The court found that; 
</pre>

<pre> 
     Church peyote users believe that peyote is a sacred and 
   powerful plant.  Peyote is seen as a medicine, a protector, 
   and a teacher.  In terms used by other religions, peyote can 
   be called a sacrament, something which when eaten gives 
   awareness of God.  The use of peyote is central to the Na- 
   tive American peyote religion.  The religion teaches that 
   those who use peyote must not use alcohol.  It encourages 
   love of parents and obedience to parents, fidelity to a 
   spouse, and charity towards others.  The peyote religion 
   does not prohibit members from also practicing other reli- 
   gions. 
</pre>

<pre> 
  Medical evidence, based on scientific studies and. opinions of 
scientific and other experts, including medical doctors, former directors 
of the Indian Health Service and Enthropologists, clearly demonstrates 
peyote is not injurious to the Indian religious user, and, in fact, is 
often helpful in controlling alcoholism and alcohol abuse among Indian 
people.  Ingested as a solid or tea in strictly prescribed and controlled 
religious ceremonies, the sacrament is neither addictive nor habit 
forming.  Courts which have made factual findings regarding the religious 
use of peyote by Indians have concluded that such use is not harmful. 
  While the First Amendment right of Indian practitioners of the peyote  
religion is endangered by the Smith decision, its religious use is  
basically non-controversial.  Attempts by the Congress to recognize and  
protect this right have a long history.  When the House of 
Representatives passed H.R. 2, which became the &quot;Drug Abuse Control 
Amendments of 1965&quot;, it protected the right of Indians to use peyote in 
connection with the ceremonies of a certified religious organization.  
The Senate omitted that specific protection, preferring that substances 
be included on such a list on a case-by-case basis.  Congressman Harris 
assured House members that such omissions would not prevent bona fide 
religious use because courts had already upheld peyote use as a First 
Amendment right.  The Administration then added peyote to Schedule I by 
administrative 
</pre>

<hr>

                             4 
</pre>

<pre> 
regulation in 1966, but provided an exemption for non-drug use of peyote 
in religious ceremonies of the Native American Church. 
  When Congress passed the Controlled Substance Act of 1970, it enacted  
Schedule I into law.  During hearings on the legislation, Congressman  
Satterfield expressed concern that the religious use of peyote by Indian  
practitioners be protected.  The Administration assured him that this 
would be taken care of by regulation.  The regulations, adopted in 1971 
to implement the Act, provide at 21 CFR  1307.31: 
</pre>

<pre> 
     The listing of peyote as a controlled substance in Sched- 
   ule I does not apply to the nondrug use of peyote in bona 
   fide religious ceremonies of the Native American Church. 
</pre>

<pre> 
  Since that time, Native American Church use of peyote as a religious  
sacrament has had the limited protection of Federal regulation.  
Officials of the Drug Enforcement Administration of the Department of 
Justice testified at House hearings in 1993 and 1994 that the religious 
use of peyote by Indians has nothing to do with the vast and violent 
traffic in illegal narcotics that plagues this country.  The DEA further 
testified that it is unaware of the diversion of peyote to any illicit 
market.  The NAC has a good, cooperative relationship with the DEA in 
ensuring that peyote is lawfully harvested and distributed solely for 
American Indian religious use.  The distribution of peyote is strictly 
controlled by Federal regulations, and by the laws and regulations of the 
State of Texas, the only State in which the sacrament grows in 
significant quantities. 
  In addition to the Federal regulatory exemption of the DEA, 28 States  
provide some degree of legal protection for the religious use of peyote 
by Indians.  However, neither the Federal regulation nor the State laws  
provide the full range of protection needed for the unhindered religious  
use of peyote by Indians, and 22 States still have no legal protection at  
all.  In some States, the legal protection for Indians is limited to the  
opportunity to assert the religious use of peyote as an affirmative 
defense in the context of felony prosecution.  Thus, bona fide NAC 
members can be arrested, finger-printed, incarcerated and subjected to 
all the indignities of a felony prosecution before they can be vindicated 
and set free.  Even then, they will have a criminal record--simply for 
practicing a bona fide religion that predates the founding of this 
country by some 10,000 years. 
  As a result of the diverse State laws governing the use of peyote,  
Indians in different tribes from different States, as well as from  
different tribes within some States, are treated differently regarding 
the traditional religious use of peyote. [Footnote 1]  NAC members who 
have 
</pre>

<pre> 
  [Footnote 1] For example, there are three Indian reservations in 
Nebraska where Native Americans reside: the Winnebago, Omaha and Santee 
Sioux.  Nebraska state law does not provide for an exemption for the 
religious use of peyote by Indians.  Therefore, Native American Church 
members transporting the sacrament to any of the three Nebraska 
reservations could be arrested, prosecuted and incarcerated if caught in 
possession of the sacrament anywhere in the state before they enter the 
reservation.  As a result of federal Indian policy and related 
jurisdictional matters, the State of Nebraska does not have criminal 
jurisdiction over the Winnebago or Omaha reservations, but does have such 
authority over the Santee Sioux Reservation.  Thus, Omaha and Winnebago 
Indians may lawfully use peyote for religious purposes on their own 
reservations, because state law is not applicable there and such use is 
protected by the federal exemption of the DEA.  However, Indians using 
the sacrament on the Santee Sioux Reservation could be prosecuted under 
state law since Nebraska criminal law is applicable at Santee and there 
is no state law exemption for the religious use of the sacrament.  Such 
anomalous situations are not uncommon and underscore the need for a 
uniform national law that will provide American Indians with equal 
protection throughout the nation. 
</pre>

<hr>

<pre> 
                            5

<pre> 
lawfully acquired the sacrament in Texas can still be arrested and  
subjected to felony prosecution and imprisonment in 22 States, States in  
which they may live or through which they must travel on their way home  
from Texas after lawfully acquiring the sacrament.  This current State-
by-State patchwork of laws has a chilling effect on the freedom of many 
Indian people to travel in this country and to practice their religion.   
Legislation is therefore needed to assure comprehensive, equal and 
uniform protection of the religious use of peyote by Indians throughout 
the United States, without regard to the State or reservation of 
residence, or tribal affiliation. 
  While 28 States do provide varying legal protections for the religious  
use of peyote by Indians, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1990 in the 
Smith case that it is constitutionally permissible for States to prohibit 
such use.  This legislation is made necessary by the Smith ruling. 
</pre>

<pre> 
  THE SMITH DECISION AND RESTORATION OF THE COMPELLING 
             GOVERNMENT INTEREST TEST 
</pre>

<pre> 
  The Smith case began as an unemployment compensation dispute involving  
Alfred Smith, a Native American employee of a private drug and alcohol  
rehabilitation facility.  Smith was fired and denied unemployment 
benefits after acknowledging he had ingested the peyote sacrament during 
a traditional religious ceremony of the Native American Church.  The 
Oregon Employment Division believed that the State had a compelling 
interest in proscribing the use of certain drugs pursuant to a controlled 
substance law. 
  Smith filed a case disputing the denial of unemployment benefits and  
questioning the constitutionality of the controlled substance law as it  
applied to his religious practice.  Following protracted litigation, the  
Oregon Supreme Court ruled that the prohibition on the sacramental use of  
peyote violated the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. 
  The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, holding that the free exercise clause 
of the First Amendment did not prohibit the State of Oregon from banning 
the sacramental use of peyote through its general criminal prohibition 
laws, or from denying unemployment benefits to persons dismissed from 
their jobs for such religiously inspired use.  In an opinion written by 
Justice Scalia (joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White, 
Stevens, and Kennedy), the Court discarded the long-standing compelling 
interest test, holding that facially neutral laws of general 
applicability that burden the free exercise of religion require no 
special justification to satisfy free exercise scrutiny. 
  Finally, the Court asserted that the free exercise of religion may be  
protected through the political process.  According to the majority, its  
inability to find constitutional protection for religiously inspired 
action burdened by generally applicable laws does not mean statutory 
exemptions to such laws are not permitted or even desired.  However, the 
majority noted: 
</pre>

<pre> 
     It may fairly be said that leaving accommodation to the 
   political process will place at a relative disadvantage those 
   religious practices that are not widely engaged in; but that 
</pre>

<hr>

<pre> 
                             6 
</pre>

<pre> 
   unavoidable consequence of democratic government must 
   be preferred to a system in which each conscience is a law 
   unto itself or in which judges weight the social importance 
   of all laws against the centrality of all religious beliefs.  
   [Footnote 2] 
</pre>

<pre> 
  To reach its decision, the majority had to strain its reading of the  
First Amendment and ignore years of precedent in which the compelling  
government interest test was applied in a variety of circumstances.  In a  
strongly worded concurrence, Justice O'Connor took sharp issue with the  
Court's abandonment of the compelling government interest test.  Justice  
O'Connor reviewed the Court's precedents and found that they confirmed 
that the compelling interest standard is the appropriate means to protect 
the religious liberty guaranteed by the First Amendment: 
</pre>

<pre> 
     To say that a person's right to free exercise has been 
   burdened, of course, does not mean that he has an abso- 
   lute right to engage in the conduct.  Under our established 
   First Amendment jurisprudence, we have recognized that 
   the freedom to act, unlike the freedom to believe, cannot 
   be absolute.  Instead, we have respected both the First 
   Amendment's express textual mandate and the govern- 
   mental interest in regulation of conduct by requiring the 
   government to justify any substantial burden on reli- 
   giously motivated conduct by a compelling state interest 
   and by means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. 
   [Footnote 3] 
</pre>

<pre> 
  This controversial decision by a divided Court has been heavily  
criticized by constitutional law scholars, religious leaders, and civil  
libertarians.  In 1993, Congress overturned portions of the Smith 
decision by enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 
(RFRA), Pub. L. 103-141, 107 Stat 1488 (42 U.S.C.  2OOObb et seq.,).  
However, RFRA left open the question of whether the reinstated compelling 
government interest test would provide adequate legal protection for the 
traditional religious use of peyote by American Indians--the precise 
religious practice at issue in Smith.  As President Clinton emphasized 
when he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act on November 16, 
1993: 
</pre>

<pre> 
     The agenda for restoration of religious freedom in Amer- 
   ica will not be complete until traditional Native American 
   religious practices have received the protection they de- 
   serve.  My Administration has been and will continue to 
   work actively with Native Americans and the Congress on 
   legislation to address these concerns. 
</pre>

<pre> 
  NEED FOR H.R. 4230 NOTWITHSTANDING THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
                 RESTORATION ACT OF 1993 
</pre>

<pre> 
  The Committee recognizes that H.R. 4230 remains necessary 
notwithstanding the recent enactment of the Religious Freedom Restoration 
Act of 1993.  Justice O'Connor agreed with the judgment of the majority 
in Smith that Oregon's prohibition of the sacramental use of peyote was 
constitutionally permissible.  However, she thought it unnecessary to 
discard the compelling government inter-

<pre> 
est test in order to reach this result.  Instead, Justice O'Connor would  
have retained and applied the traditional test to rule that the religious  
use of peyote by Indians is not protected by the first Amendment, since 
in her view the &quot;State in this case has a compelling interest in 
regulating peyote use by its citizens-- * * *&quot; [Footnote 4]  In Justice 
O'Connor's view, Oregon would have met the compelling government interest 
test solely on the judgment of the State legislature to list peyote as a 
Class 1 controlled substance, and notwithstanding factual considerations. 
  The Supreme Court's reliance on Oregon's position in Smith that the 
State has an interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens 
from the &quot;dangers&quot; of peyote is highly questionable.  As pointed out by 
Justice Blackmun in his dissent in Smith, Oregon's position &quot;rests on no  
evidentiary foundation at all,&quot; and is therefore entirely speculative&quot;.  
[Footnote 5]  As underscored by the dissent, the majority agreed with  
Oregon's assertion, notwithstanding that Oregon failed to offer any  
&quot;evidence that the religious use of peyote has ever harmed anyone.&quot; 
[Footnote 6]  To the contrary, the record in Smith amply showed that: 
</pre>

<pre> 
     (1) Factual findings of other courts contradict Oregon's as- 
   sumption that the religious use of peyote is harmful; 
     (2) Medical evidence, based on the opinion of scientists and 
   other experts, including medical doctors and anthropologists, is 
   that peyote is not injurious; 
     (3) The distribution and use of peyote has nothing to do with 
   the vast and violent traffic in illegal narcotics that plagues this 
   country; 
     (4) There is virtually no illegal trafficking in peyote--Drug 
   Enforcement Administration (DEA) data indicates that be- 
   tween 1980 and 1987, only 19.4 pounds of peyote was con- 
   fiscated, while during the same period the DEA seized over 15 
   million pounds of marijuana; 
     (5) The distribution of peyote is strictly controlled by Federal 
   and Texas State regulations--the only State where peyote 
   grows in significant quantities; 
     (6) The carefully circumscribed religious context in which pe- 
   yote is used by Indians is far removed from the irresponsible 
   and unrestricted recreational use of unlawful drugs, and is 
   similar to the sacramental use of wine by the Roman Catholic 
   Church, which was exempted from the general statutory ban 
   on possession and use of alcohol during Prohibition; 
     (7) The Federal Government and 23 States [now 28] provide 
   an exemption from respective drug laws for the religious use 
   of peyote by American Indians; 
     (8) Native American Church doctrine forbids the non-reli- 
   gious use of peyote, and also advocates self-reliance, familial 
   responsibility and abstinence from alcohol; 
     (9) Spiritual and social support provided by the Native 
   American Church has been effective in combatting the tragic 
   effects of alcoholism among the Native American population;

     (10) Oregon's assertion that granting a religious exemption 
   for the use of peyote would open the floodgates to claims for 
   the religious use of controlled substances by other religious de- 
   nominations is not an issue because the Supreme Court and 
   lower courts over the years have consistently rejected similar 
   arguments in past free exercise cases, having held that the re- 
   ligious use of peyote by American Indians is the sole cir- 
   cumstance warranting claims for a religious exemption for any 
   controlled substance; and 
     (11)granting a religious exemption solely for the sac- 
   ramental use of peyote by American Indians presents no equal 
   protection problems. 
</pre>

<pre> 
  Notwithstanding the above-referenced record in Smith, Justice O'Connor  
felt Oregon had a compelling interest to prohibit the religious use of  
peyote, even though Oregon had never evinced a concrete interest in  
enforcing its drug laws against religious users of peyote--including Al  
Smith, the plaintiff in the Smith case.  The committee recognizes that  
traditional Indian religions, including the peyote religion, are highly 
unique in nature and are little understood by the courts and other 
government officials.  Given this backdrop, the Committee believes that 
the traditional religious use of the peyote sacrament by Indians requires 
statutory protection.  H.R. 4230 responds to the Supreme Court's 
invitation in Smith to accommodate this ancient religious practice 
through the political process. 
  Absent Federal legislation, the question of whether a given State has a  
compelling interest to prohibit the religious use of peyote by Indians is  
one that would necessarily be determined by the courts on a State-by-
State basis.  The Committee recognizes that such determination could 
require numerous State supreme court decisions and a corresponding number 
of U.S. Supreme Court opinions--with varying results possible, as well as 
numerous lower State and Federal court decisions.  Such piecemeal 
judicial resolution to this issue is not likely to produce uniform, just 
or equal results, and would be unduly burdensome, costly and time 
consuming.  The Committee recognizes that uniform and equal protection of 
Indians without regard to State or reservation of residence, or tribal 
affiliation, can only be accomplished by Congress through comprehensive 
legislation.

                   CONSTITUTIONALITY 
</pre>

<pre> 
  Since the creation of the United States, the treaty relationship 
between Indian tribes and the United States government has engendered a 
long-standing political relationship under the Constitution.  This 
relationship includes a Federal trust responsibility for Indian tribes 
which has resulted in hundreds of separate Federal statutes dealing with 
all aspects of Indian life, including health, education, religion, 
economic development, children, employment, language and culture, gaming, 
and a host of other subject matter areas.  An entire title of the United 
States Code (25 U.S.C.) is devoted exclusively to Indian legislation. 
  Because Indians and Indian tribes occupy a sui generis legal status in  
Federal law under the U.S. Constitution and enjoy a special political  
relationship with the United States Government, separate

<pre> 
Indian legislation has consistently been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court  
under the legal principles set forth in Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535,  
551-55 (1974).  At the urging of the U.S. Department of Justice, the 
long-standing rationale for special Indian treatment by the Federal 
Government was recently applied by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals 
regarding the religious use of peyote in Peyote Way Church of God v. 
Thornburgh, 922 F.2d 1210 (5th Cir. 1991).  Finding that the Native 
American Church (NAC) members were also members of federally recognized 
tribes, the Fifth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the DEA's 
protective regulation against an equal protection challenge: 
</pre>

<pre> 
     We hold that the federal NAC exemption allowing tribal 
   Native Americans to continue their centuries-old tradition 
   of peyote use is rationally related to the legitimate govern- 
   mental objective of preserving Native American culture. 
   Such preservation is fundamental to the Federal Govern- 
   ment's trust relationship with tribal Native Americans. 
   Under Morton, [non-Indians] are not similarly situated 
   to--NAC [members] for purposes of cultural preservation 
   and thus, the Federal Government may exempt NAC mem- 
   bers from statutes prohibiting possession of peyote without 
   extending the exemption to [non-Indians]. [Footnote 8] 
</pre>

<pre> 
  The Fifth Circuit also ruled that the DEA exemption for NAC members did  
not violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment: 
</pre>

<pre> 
     The unique guardian-ward relationship between the 
   Federal Government and Native American Indian tribes 
   precludes the degree of separation of church and state or- 
   dinarily required by the First Amendment.  The Federal 
   Government cannot at once fulfill its constitutional role as 
   protector of tribal Native Americans and apply conven- 
   tional separatist understandings of the establishment 
   clause to that relationship. 
     * * * Thus, we hold that the Federal NAC exemption 
   represents the Government's protection of the culture of 
   quasi-sovereign Native American tribes and as such, does 
   not represent an establishment of religion in contravention 
   of the First Amendment. [Footnote 9] 
</pre>

<pre> 
  Based on the special relationship between the United States and 
Federally recognized tribes, and on Peyote Way Church of God, the U.S. 
Department of Justice testified that Congress has the requisite authority 
to enact H.R. 4230, and that it is constitutionally sound.  Accordingly, 
the Committee is confident that the granting of a statutory religious 
exemption for the sacramental use of peyote solely by American Indians 
presents no equal protection or establishment clause problems, and 
therefore stands on a solid constitutional footing.

                COMMITTEE AMENDMENT 
</pre>

<pre>  
  The Committee Amendment to Hl.R. 4230 provides that Federal departments  
or agencies are not prohibited from promulgating regulations establishing  
reasonable time limitations on the use or ingestion of peyote prior to  
performance of official duties by active military personnel, sworn law  
enforcement officers, or personnel directly involved in public safety or  
safety-sensitive positions where the performance of such duties may be  
adversely affected by such use or ingestion.  While the committee is  
unaware of any such problems in the past, it intends to accommodate  
prospective concerns articulated principally by the Department of  
Transportation and Department of Defense. 
  An official of the Native American Church testified at the June 10, 
1994 hearing of the Native American Affairs Subcommittee that the effects 
of peyote do not persist more than 6 hours.  The Committee recognizes the  
medical literature and related studies indicate that mescaline, the  
psychoactive component of peyote, may persist in the brain for up to 9 to  
10 hours, [Footnote 10] and that the physiological effects of peyote can  
last up to 12 hours. [Footnote 11]  The committee therefore deems a 
period of 6 to 24 hours to be &quot;reasonable&quot; as to authorized time 
limitations regarding the use or ingestion of peyote, pursuant to 
regulations the departments or agencies may promulgate under H.R. 4230.  
The committee further believes that, where an agency proposes a time 
limitation exceeding 24 hours, it should be prepared to show such 
limitation meets the balancing test set forth in the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act.  The Committee is confident that the bill and the 6 to 
24 hour range for time limitations will adequately and amply meet the 
needs of affected departments, and will not adversely impact the ability 
of U.S. military personnel, law enforcement officers or persons directly 
involved in positions related to public safety to maintain good order, 
discipline, security and safety. 
  The Committee does not intend the act to impose requirements that would  
exacerbate the difficult and complex challenges of operating the Nation's  
prisons and jails in a safe and secure manner.  Accordingly, the 
Committee does not intend the Act to require prison officials to either 
prescribe or proscribe the religious use of peyote by Indian inmates.  
Rather, the Committee expects that these matters will be addressed under 
the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, and that the courts will 
continue the tradition of giving due deference to the experience and 
expertise of prison and jail administrators in establishing necessary 
rules and procedures to maintain good order, security and discipline.

  Section 2 amends the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1975 by  
adding a new &quot;Section 3&quot; as follows: 
      Subsection (a) provides the findings of the Congress. 
  Subsection (b)(1) provides that the use, possession or transportation 
of peyote by an Indian for ceremonial purposes is lawful and is not to be  
prohibited by the United States or any State Government.  It further  
provides that no Indian is to be penalized or discriminated against on 
the basis of the use, possession or transportation of peyote and benefits 
under public assistance programs are not to be denied. 
      Subsection (b)(2) provides that this section does not prohibit 
    the regulation and registration by the Drug Enforcement Ad- 
    ministration of persons who cultivate, harvest or distribute pe- 
    yote under this Act. 
      Subsection (b)(3) provides that this section is not to impact 
    a Texas law governing the growing and distribution of peyote. 
      Subsection (b)(4) provides that departments or agencies are 
    not prohibited from promulgating regulations establishing rea- 
    sonable time limitations on the use or ingestion of peyote prior 
    to the performance of official duties by certain personnel.  This 
    subsection also provides that affected departments or agencies 
    are not prohibited from establishing reasonable limitations on 
    the transportation of peyote on military bases or overseas.  The 
    regulations are to be adopted only alter consultation with rep- 
    resentatives of traditional Indian religions for which the sac- 
    ramental use of peyote is integral. 
      Subsection (c) provides for definitions for terms used in this 
    section.

                 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY 
</pre>

<pre>  
  H.R. 4230 was introduced by Representatives Richardson on April 14, 
1994.  The Subcommittee on Native American Affairs held a hearing on H.R. 
4230 on June 10, 1994.  The Subcommittee considered and unanimously 
passed a substitute amendment to H.R. 4230, which was reported to the 
Committee on Natural Resources.  On July 27, 1994, the Committee on 
Natural Resources considered H.R. 4230 and ordered it to be reported to 
the House with an amendment.

      SECTION 3 OF THE ACT OF AUGUST 11, 1978 
  (POPULARLY KNOWN AS THE AMERICAN INDIAN RELIGIOUS 
                    FREEDOM ACT) 
</pre>

<pre>  
SEC. 3. (a) The Congress finds and declares that-- 
     (1) for many Indian people, the traditional ceremonial 
   use of the peyote cactus as a religious sacrament has for cen- 
   turies been integral to a way of life, and significant in 
   perpetuating Indian tribes and cultures; 
     (2) since 1965, this ceremonial use of peyote by Indians 
   has been protected by Federal regulation; 
     (3) while at least 28 States have enacted laws which 
   are similar to, or are in conformance with, the Federal regula- 
   tion which protects the ceremonial use of peyote by Indian 
   religious practitioners, 22 States have not done so, and this 
   lack of uniformity has created hardship for Indian people who 
   participate in such religious ceremonies; 
     (4) the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case 
   of Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), held 
   that the First Amendment does not protect Indian practitioners 
   who use peyote in Indian religious ceremonies, and also raised 
   uncertainty whether this religious practice would be protected 
   under the compelling State interest standard; and 
      (5) the lack of adequate and clear legal protection for 
   the religious use of peyote by Indians may serve to stigmatize 
   and marginalize Indian tribes and cultures, and increase the 
   risk that they will be exposed to discriminatory treatment. 
  (b)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the use, possession,  
or transportation of peyote by an Indian for bona fide traditional  
ceremonial purposes in connection with the practice of a traditional 
Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited by the United 
States or any State.  No Indian shall be penalized or discriminated 
against on the basis of such use, possession or transportation, 
including, but not limited to, denial of otherwise applicable benefits 
under public assistance programs. 
  (2) This section does not prohibit such reasonable regulation and  
registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration of those persons who  
cultivate, harvest, or distribute peyote as may be consistent with the  
purposes of this Act. 
  (3) This section does not prohibit application of the provisions of  
section 481.111(a) of Vernon's Texas Health and Safety Code Annotated, in  
effect on the date of enactment of this section, insofar as those  
provisions pertain to the cultivation, harvest, and distribution of 
peyote. 
  (4) Nothing in this section shall prohibit any Federal department or  
agency, in carrying out its statutory responsibilities and functions, 
from promulgating regulations establishing reasonable limitations on the 
use or ingestion of peyote prior to or during the performance of duties 
by sworn law enforcement officers or personnel directly involved in 
public transportation or any other safety-sensitive positions where the  
performance of such duties may be adversely affected by such use or  
ingestion.  Such regulations shall be adopted only after consultation 
with representatives of traditional Indian religions for which the 
sacramental use of peyote is integral to their practice.  Any regulation 
promulgated pursuant to this section shall be subject to the balancing 
test set forth in section 3 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act 
(Public Law 103-141; 42 U.S.C. 2OOObb-1). 
  (c) For purposes of this section-- 
     (1) the term 'Indian' means a member of an Indian tribe; 
     (2) the term 'Indian tribe' means any tribe, band, nation, 
   pueblo, or other organized group or community of Indians, 
   including any Alaska Native village (as defined in, or estab- 
   lished pursuant to, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 
   (43 U.S.C. l601 et seq.)), which is recognized as eligible for 
   the special programs and services provide by the United States 
   to Indians because of their status as Indians; 
     (3) the term 'Indian religion' means any religion-- 
          (A) which is practiced by Indians; and 
          (B) the origin and interpretation of which is from 
       within a traditional Indian culture or community; and 
     (4) the term 'State' means any State of the United States 
   and any political subdivision thereof. 
  (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed as abrogating, 
diminishing, or otherwise affecting-- 
     (1) the inherent rights of any Indian tribe; 
     (2) the rights, express or implicit, of any Indian tribe 
  which exist under treaties, Executive orders, and laws of the 
  United States; 
     (3) the inherent right of Indians to practice their religions; 
  and 
     (4) the right of Indians to practice their religions under 
  any Federal or State law.

Hon. GEORGE MILLER, 
Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
  DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed H.R.  
4230, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments of 1994, as  
ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 27,  
1994.  We estimate the implementation of the bill would have no effect on  
the Federal budget or on the budgets of State or local governments.   
Enactment of H.R. 4230 would not affect direct spending or receipts.   
Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply to this bill. 
  H.R. 4230 would amend the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978  
by adding a new section that would permit the use, possession, or  
transportation of peyote by Indians for sacramental purposes.  However, 
the bill would not prohibit the Drug Enforcement Administration from 
regulating peyote cultivation or distribution, nor would it prohibit 
Federal agencies from regulating peyote use by certain types of Federal 
personnel prior to performing their official duties. 
  If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to  
provide them.  The CBO staff contact is Rachel A. Robertson. 
    Sincerely, 
                                       JAMES T. BLUM,

Mr. TADD JOHNSON, 
Chief Counsel, Subcommittee on Native American Affairs, House of 
  Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. JOHNSON: It is my understanding that H.R. 4230, &quot;American Indian  
Religious Freedom Act of 1994&quot;, is nearing floor consideration in the  
House.  You will recall that while the Drug Enforcement Administration  
(DEA) was unable to have a witness at your hearing regarding this matter 
on June 10, 1994, that we did submit a statement for the record.  That  
statement succinctly puts forth the history of DEA's regulation of peyote 
and the exemption for its use in traditional Native American ceremonies.  
DEA has encountered no problems with the use of peyote in these 
traditional ceremonies nor has diversion of peyote been a problem. 
  DEA has had a long and cooperative association with the Native American  
Church, working with them since the early 1970's to assure that our 
mutual concerns relating to peyote are met.  We have worked with its  
representatives to assure that the bill language effectively addresses  
these matters.  DEA supports the passage of H.R. 4230 as it was reported 
by the Committee on Natural Resources with the amendments that address 
public safety concerns.

STATEMENT OF GENE R. HAISLIP, DEPUTY ASSISTANT ADMINIS- 
  TRATOR, OFFICE OF DIVERSION CONTROL, DRUG ENFORCEMENT 
  ADMINISTRATION 
</pre>

<pre>  
Chairman Richardson and Members of the Subcommittee: 
  The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) appreciates the opportunity 
to comment regarding H.R. 4230 &quot;American Indian Religious Freedom Act of  
1994.&quot;  This bill seeks to statutorily provide for the traditional use of  
peyote by Indians for religious purposes. 
  Almost 25 years ago when Congress began hearings pertaining to the  
Controlled Substances Act (CSA) they decided that the traditional, 
historic use of peyote by members of the Native American Church (NAC) as 
a sacrament in traditional religious ceremonies warranted a specific 
exemption.  Congress determined, to be consistent with past Federal 
practice, this exemption should be specified in regulation rather in law.  
Consequently, an exception was created for the NAC to use peyote for 
religious purposes.  Although the NAC is not defined in the subject 
regulations, the members of this church are required to be Native 
American. 
  The regulation has worked very well for both DEA and the NAC with only  
minor difficulties from time to time concerning the natural supply of the  
drug and the difficulties obtaining peyote outside of the area where it  
grows locally.  In fact, our experience over the years in enforcing this  
regulation has revealed no particular problems of abuse of this substance  
by the NAC or its members.  Unfortunately there will always be 
individuals who seek to circumvent the regulations for their own purposes 
and on occasion, DEA has dealt with groups who have attempted to expand 
the exemption to authorize the use of peyote or other controlled 
substances in what they claimed to be religious ceremonies. 
  On occasion, peyote, who primary active ingredient is mescaline, a  
hallucinogen similar to LSD, has been found in the illicit traffic.  It 
has not been reported by DEA, State or local enforcement agencies to be  
anything other than a sporadic problem.  Despite the fact that the  
regulation allows for the legal use of the drug and the registration of  
legitimate distributors, DEA at this time is not aware of the diversion 
of the drug to any illicit market. 
  Although we at DEA feel that the regulation that has been in place for  
almost 25 years has worked well, we would prefer a statutory exemption 
over an administrative exemption.  We have reviewed H.R. 4230 and could 
support the bill if amended to: (1) restrict the use, possession, or 
transportation of peyote to bona fide traditional ceremonial purposes 
only; and (2) to make clarifying amendments to address public safety 
concerns. 
  DEA and the NAC have maintained a close working relationship to allow 
the use of peyote for religious ceremony without diversion or abuse.  DEA  
believes the passage of this legislation will serve to 
</pre>

</pre>

<pre>  
strengthen the uniform application throughout all of the states without  
reprisal to NAC members of this religious exception.  Mr. Chairman, this  
concludes my statement.  I will be pleased to answer any questions that 
you may have.

                  THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
                 FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS 
                       SAN ANTONIO DIVISION 
</pre>

<pre> 
P.F. FLORES, ARCHBISHOP OF 
SAN ANTONIO 
                                              SA-94-CA-0421 
v. 
</pre>

<pre>
THE CITY OF BOERNE 
</pre>

<pre> 
     BEFORE THE COURT, in the above-captioned cause of action, is  
</pre>

<pre>  
the special issue raised by Defendant, the City of Boerne, in  
</pre>

<pre>  
which Defendant challenges the constitutionality of the recently  
</pre>

<pre>  
passed Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C.  2000bb  
</pre>

<pre>  
[herinafter RFRA]. 
</pre>

<pre>  
                             BACKGROUND 
</pre>

<pre>  
     The United States Congress passed RFRA in early November of  
</pre>

<pre>  
1993 and it was signed by President Clinton on November l6, 1993. 
</pre>

<pre>  
     RFRA sets out in pertinent part: 
</pre>

<pre>  
     SEC. 3. FREE EXECISE OF RELIGION PROTECTED. 
          (a) IN GENERAL, -- Government shall not substantially  
     burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden  
     results from a rule of general applicability, except as  
     provided in subsection (b). 
</pre>

<pre>  
          (b) EXCEPTION. -- Government may substantially burden  
     a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that  
     application of the burden to the person - 
</pre>

<pre>  
               (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental  
          interest; and 
</pre>

<pre>  
               (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering  
          that compelling governmental interest. 
</pre>

<pre>  
     (emphasis supplied). 
</pre>

<pre>  
     Such an Act under normal circumstances would be readily  
</pre>

<pre>  
enforceable by this Court; however, it has come to the Court's  
</pre>

<pre>  
attention that thes Act seeks to overturn an interpretation of  
</pre>

<pre>  
the United States Constitution by the Supreme Court.  Indeed, in  
</pre>

<pre>  
the Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purposes, the  
</pre>

<pre>  
Congress specifically sought to create a heightened burden of  
</pre>

<pre>  
proof standard from that held in Employment Division v. Smith,  
</pre>

<pre>  
494 U.S. 872 (1990).  The Findings state in pertinent part: 
</pre>

<pre>  
     (1) the framers of the Constitution, recognizing free 
     exercise of religion as an unalienable right, secured 
     its protection in the First Amendment to the 
     Constitution . . . 
</pre>

<pre>  
     (4) in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872  
     (1990) the Supreme Court virtually eliminated the 
     requirement that the government justify burdens on 
     religious exercise imposed by laws neutral toward 
     religion . . . 
</pre>

<pre>  
     The purposes of this Act are - 
          (1) to restore the compelling interest test 
     as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963) 
     and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972) and to 
     guarantee its application in all cases where the free 
     exercise of religion is substantially burdened . . . . 
</pre>

<pre>  
     On February 2, 1995, the Court was made aware of Defendant's  
</pre>

<pre>  
special issue during a pretrial hearing and agreed to 1) Certify  
</pre>

<pre>  
the Question pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2403(a) to the Attorney  
</pre>

<pre>  
General of the United States, and 2) for both parties to submit  
</pre>

<pre>  
briefs addressing the constitutionality of RFRA.  On March 3,  
</pre>

<pre>  
1995, Defendant submitted its brief.  On March 6, 1995, Plaintiff  
</pre>

<pre>  
submitted its reply brief and the Solicitor General agreed to  
</pre>

<pre>  
intervene on behalf of the United States of America, likewise  
</pre>

<pre>  
submitting a reply brief. 
</pre>

<pre>  
                             ANALYSIS 
</pre>

<pre>  
     According to the holding of Marbury v. Madison, &quot;[i]t is  
</pre>

<pre>  
emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to  
</pre>

<pre>  
say what the law is.&quot;  1 Cranch. 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).   
</pre>

<pre>  
Subsequent Supreme Court cases have echoed this fact: 
</pre>

<pre>  
     Deciding whether a matter has in any measure been 
     committed by the Constitution to another branch of 
     government, or whether the action of that branch 
     exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is 
     itself a delicate exercise in constitutional 
     interpretation, and is a responsibility of this 
     Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. 
</pre>

<pre>  
Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 211 (1962).  In United States v.  
</pre>

<pre>  
Nixon, the Court stated: 
</pre>

<pre>  
     Notwithstanding the deference each branch must 
     accord the others, the 'judicial power of the 
     United States' vested in the federal courts by 
     Article III,  1, of the Constitution can no more 
     be shared with the Executive Branch than the Chief 
     Executive, for example, can share with the 
     judiciary the veto power, or the Congress share 
     with the Judiciary the power to override a 
     Presidential veto.  Any other conclusion would be 
     contrary to the basic concept of separation of 
     powers and the checks and balances that flow from 
     the scheme of a tripartite government.  The 
     Federalist, No. 47, p. 313 (S. Mirrell ed. 1938). 
     We therefore reaffirm that it is the province and 
     duty of this Court 'to say what the law is . .  
     . .'&quot; 
</pre>

<pre>  
418 U.S. 683, 704-05 (1974). 
</pre>

<pre>  
     In this instance, Congress specifically sought to overturn  
</pre>

<pre>  
Supreme Court precedent as found in Employment Division v. Smith  
</pre>

<pre>  
through the passage of RFRA.  The Supreme Court in Smith found  
</pre>

<pre>  
the heightened standard applied in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S.  
</pre>

<pre>  
298 (1963), to be limited over the years to cases within the  
</pre>

<pre>  
unemployment compensation field.  Id. at 884.  The Smith court  
</pre>

<pre>  
added, &quot;[e]ven if we were inclined to breathe into Sherbet some  
</pre>

<pre>  
life beyond the unemployment compensation field, we would not  
</pre>

<pre>  
apply it to require exemptions from a generally applicable law.&quot;   
</pre>

<pre>  
Id.  The Court is cognizant of Congress' Authority under Section  
</pre>

<pre>  
5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, yet it is convinced of Congress'  
</pre>

<pre>  
violation of the doctrine of Separation of Powers by intruding on  
</pre>

<pre>  
the power and duty of the judiciary. 
</pre>

<pre>  
     The Court is cautious in its opinion of RFRA's  
</pre>

<pre>  
unconstitutionality as there has been insufficient case law, to  
</pre>

<pre>  
date, construing it.  See Belgard v. State of Hawaii, No. 93- 
</pre>

<pre>  
00961 (D. Haw. Feb. 3, 1995) (holding that RFRA constitutional  
</pre>

<pre>  
pursuant to Congress' enforcement power under Section 5 of the  
</pre>

<pre>  
Fourteenth Amendment). [Footnote 1]  Nevertheless, Smith remains  
</pre>

<pre>  
the law in this area for this Court to follow pursuant to the  
</pre>

<pre>  
doctrine of stare decisis.  The doctrine of stare decisis is not  
</pre>

<pre>  
a universal, inexorable command, especially in cases involving  
</pre>

<pre>  
the interpretation of the United States Constitution.  Planned  
</pre>

<pre>  
Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2861 (1992)  
</pre>

<pre>  
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  &quot;Nonetheless, the doctrine of stare  
</pre>

<pre>  
decisis, while perhaps never entirely persuasive on a  
</pre>

<pre>  
constitutional question, is a doctine that demands respect in a  
</pre>

<pre>  
society governed by the rule of law.&quot;  City of Akron v. Akron  
</pre>

<pre>  
Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416, 419-20 (1983). 
</pre>

<pre>  
     [Footnote 1] This Court seriously questions the District of  
Hawaii's interpretation of RFRA's legitimacy through Section 5 of  
the Fourteenth Amendment.  RFRA only mentions the First Amendment  
as the empowering provision to change the burden of proof  
standard to compelling interest.  &quot;Typically, the Court looks to  
the language of an Act or its legislative history for guidance on  
which power Congress understood itself to be invoking, and for  
factual support of its legal determination as to whether the  
power was invoked properly.  As applied to federal law, Congress  
simply did not enter into such an inquiry regarding RFRA.&quot;  Marci  
A. Hamilton, The Religious Freedom Restoration Act: Letting the  
Fox into the Henhouse Under Cover of Section 5 of the Fourteenth  
Amendment, 16 Cardoso L. Rev. 357, 366 (1994).  Furthermore,  
because the First Amendment is not an enumerated power of  
Congress, but merely a limitation, Katzenbach v. Morgan and its  
progeny are inapplicable.  The First Amendment to the  
Constitution does not empower Congress to regulate all federal  
law in order to achieve religious liberty, unless it is done  
pursuant to an enumerated power.  Id. at 363. 
</pre>

<pre>  
                            CONCLUSION 
</pre>

<pre>  
     After reviewing the briefs on file and the law applicable to  
</pre>

<pre>  
this area, the Court is of the opinion RFRA is in violation of  
</pre>

<pre>  
the United States Constitution and Supreme Court precedent by  
</pre>

<pre>  
unconstitutionally changing the burden of proof as established  
</pre>

<pre>  
under Employment Division v. Smith.  Accordingly, the Court is of  
</pre>

<pre>  
the opinion that this order holding RFRA to be unconstitutional  
</pre>

<pre>  
&quot;involves a controlling question of law as to which there is  
</pre>

<pre>  
substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an  
</pre>

<pre>  
immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the  
</pre>

<pre>  
ultimate termination of litigation . . . .&quot;  28 U.S.C.  1292(b).   
</pre>

<pre>  
Furthermore, the Court asks that expedited consideration of this  
</pre>

<pre>  
appeal be had pursuant to F.R.A.P. Rule 5(a). 
</pre>

<pre>  
     IT IS ORDERED the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993  
</pre>

<pre>  
is unconstitutional. 
</pre>

<pre>  
     IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that an Interlocutory Appeal to the  
</pre>

<pre>  
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals be had pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   
</pre>

<pre>  
1292(b). 
</pre>

<pre>  
     IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that expedited consideration of this  
</pre>

<pre>  
appeal be had pursuant to F.R.A.P. 5(a). 
</pre>

<pre>  
     IT IS FURTHER ORDERED the trial set for March 15, 1995 is  
</pre>

<pre>  
stayed pending the outcome of the Interlocutory Appeal. 
</pre>

<pre>  
 
     SIGNED this thirteenth day of March, 1995.

                Submitted:  November 29, 1995

                    Filed:  December 12, 1995


Before WOLLMAN, MAGILL, and HANSEN, Circuit Judges.


PER CURIAM.


     A jury found Thomas F. Brown guilty of one count of
manufacturing marijuana and one count of manufacturing peyote, in
violation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(l), and found Brown used his
forty-acre tract of land to facilitate the manufacturing process,
thus subjecting the property to forfeiture under 21 U.S.C.  853;
the district court1 sentenced Brown to 121 months imprisonment.
Brown challenges his conviction and sentence, and we affirm.

     In January 1994 Brown helped establish Our Church, and he
deeded one of his forty acres of property to the church.  The
covenants of deed provided that Our Church would produce medicinal
herbs and plants "possessed of the properties of spiritual
enlightenment" and would distribute such herbs to the sick.  Brown

_____________________
     1The Honorable H. Franklin Waters, Chief Judge, United States
District Court for the Western District cf Arkansas.
<hr>informed law enforcement officials and the media that Our Church
members intended to grow and distribute marijuana on the property;
Our Church members had a public marijuana planting ceremony.  In
August 1994 law enforcement officials seized 435 marijuana plants
and a bucket containing 3 peyote plants which had formed 5 buds.

     Following Brown's indictment, the government filed a motion in
limine to exclude from the trial any evidence or references
relating, inter alia, to Brown's contention that his religious
beliefs provided him with a legal right to grow or distribute
marijuana and peyote, and that the FirstAmendment and the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C.
 2000bb - 2000bb-4, provided him with a legal defense to the
charges.  At a one-day hearing on the motion in limine, Brown and
other Our Church members or participants testified about the role
marijuana played in their spiritual quest, how their interest in
supplying marijuana to the sick was part of their religious tenets,
and that church policy allowed distribution to anyone who wanted to
join the spiritual quest, including children with parental
permission.

     The district court assumed for the purposes of the hearing and
trial that Brown was engaged in the exercise of a religion, and
that the grand jury indictment was a burden on his free exercise of
that religion.  The court concluded, however, that the law clearly
established that the government had a compelling interest in
regulating marijuana and other drugs, and that the government had
tailored the interest as narrowly as it could to prevent the kinds
of dangers Congress believed existed.  Thus, the district court
concluded, as a matter of law, that the RFRA was not available to
Brown as a defense.  The court granted the government's motion in
limine, and barred admission at trial of all evidence covered in
the government's motion.

     After Brown's first two appointed attorneys were allowed to

                             -2-
<hr>withdraw because of disagreements with Brown over his
representation, the district court gave Brown the choice of
proceeding pro se with standby counsel or utilizing the full
assistance of counsel who would present his defense.  Brown chose
to proceed pro se rather than have counsel direct the course of the
representation.

     Following a two-day criminal trial, the jury returned a guilty
verdict on all three counts.  The district court sentenced Brown to
121 months imprisonment, four years supervised release, and $17,500
in fines.  Brown moved for a new trial, arguing only that he was
denied the assistance of counsel, which the district court denied.

     On appeal Brown argues (1) the district court erred in
restricting him from advancing any of his defenses at trial, (2)
the government lacked power under the Commerce Clause to prohibit
growing and using marijuana, (3) the court improperly denied him a
reduction for acceptance of responsibility at sentencing under
U.S.S.G.  3E1.l, and (4) the court denied him assistance of
counsel.

     It is well established that religious conduct does not enjoy
the absolute constitutional protection afforded freedom of
religious belief. See United States v. Greene, 892 F.2d 453, 456
(6th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 935 (1990).  Under the
RFRA, the "[g]overnment may substantially burden a person's
exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of
the burden to the person--(l) is in furtherance of a compelling
governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of
furthering that compelling governmental interest."  42 U.S.C.
 2000bb-l(b).  See also United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 256-59
(1982) (First Amendment challenge; standard for determining if law
interferes with religious conduct)

                              -3-
<hr>     We have recognized that the government has a compelling state
interest in controlling the use of marijuana.  See United States v.
Fogarty, 692 F.2d 542, 547-48 (8th Cir. 1982) (classification of
marijuana is rationally based and is matter for legislative, not
judicial, prerogative), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1040 (1983); see
also Greene, 892 F.2d at 455-56; United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d
497, 512-13 (1st Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1004 (1985);
United States v. Middleton, 690 F.2d 820, 822-24 (11th Cir. 1982),
cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1051 (1983)

     We agree with the district court that, based on Our Church's
broad use, the government could not have tailored the restriction
to accommodate Our Church and still protected against the kinds of
misuses it sought to prevent.  Cf. United States v. Merkt, 794 F.2d
950, 956-57 (5th Cir. 1986) (national border control laws), cert.
denied, 480 U.S. 946 (1987).  Thus, under the circumstances of this
case, we conclude the district court correctly determined that
Brown could not prevail under the RFRA or the First Amendment.  See
Rush, 738 F.2d at 513 (rejected First Amendment defense as matter
of law).  We also conclude the district court did not abuse its
discretion in disallowing Brown's other defenses.  See Fed. R.
Evid. 402; United States v. Hollister, 746 F.2d 420, 422 (8th Cir.
1984) (district court has broad discretion in determining
relevance).

     We need not consider Brown's Commerce Clause and sentencing
arguments because they are raised for the first time on appeal.
See Fritz v. United States, 995 F.2d 136, 137 (8th Cir. 1993),
cert. denied, 114 5. Ct. 887 (1994) (absent plain error, we will
not consider issues raised for first time on appeal).

     Finally, we note Brown does not have a constitutional right to
hybrid representation, see MoKaskie v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 184
(1984), which means he cannot demand the right to act as co-

                               -4-
<hr>Cir.), cert. denied, 113 5. Ct. 632 (1992), and cert. denied, 113
S. Ct. 1650 (1993).  The record is clear that, given the choice of
proceeding pro se with standby counsel or utilizing the full
assistance of counsel, Brown unequivocally chose to represent
himself.  Thus, the district court committed no error.

     Accordingly, Brown's conviction and sentence is affirmed.

<h1>High Court To Rule on Religion Law</h1>

<h2>'93 Measure Protecting Acts of Faith Produces Hundreds of
Lawsuits</h2>

<p><em>By Joan Biskupic</em><br>
Washington Post Staff Writer<br>
Wednesday, October 16 1996; Page A01<br>
The Washington Post </p>

<p>The Supreme Court yesterday accepted what promises to be a
momentous case on religious freedom, involving the
constitutionality of a 1993 federal law that makes it far more
difficult for government to infringe on religious practices, even when
they violate local statutes.</p>

<p>The law is among the most far-reaching protections of
religious activity ever passed by Congress and has been put to a
variety of uses since its 1993 enactment -- by churches seeking
exemptions from zoning requirements, by prisoners requesting they be
allowed to wear certain clothes, by landlords wanting to avoid
fair housing requirements if they deny apartments to unmarried couples.</p>

<p>State and local officials say the law has colored their
dealings with religious believers of all faiths and incited
turmoil in prisons from nearby Lorton to the Far West. As evidence
of the legal strife it has created, they note that it already has generated more
than 200 lower court cases nationwide, about half involving prisoners.</p>

<p>Called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the law was
enacted to counter a 1990 Supreme Court decision that allowed
certain infringements on religious beliefs and practices.</p>

<p>By agreeing to take the new case, the justices will not only
reenter the enduring battle between church and state, but could
produce a landmark decision on Congress's powers to reverse the effects
of a high court ruling.</p>

<p>While backers of the law say it protects America's diverse
religious interests, opponents claim it infringes on the
authority of states and municipalities and forces them to be
unnecessarily tolerant.</p>

<p>&quot;The [law] is a bold and unprecedented example of federal
social policy engineering that commandeers the states . . . to
accommodate religion more than the Constitution requires,&quot;
Marci A. Hamilton, lawyer for the city of Boerne, Tex., said in a
petition to the court.</p>

<p>The city sought to stop a local Catholic church from enlarging
its 1923 revival mission-style building in a historic district.
The archbishop of San Antonio, P.F. Flores, successfully
challenged the denial, relying on the 1993 law to make his case.</p>

<p>&quot;The church was turning people away from Mass because the
church building was too small,&quot; Douglas Laycock, lawyer for
the archbishop, said yesterday.</p>

<p>The city's refusal to allow the expansion, he said,
&quot;infringed on people's right to practice their religion.&quot;</p>

<p>When Congress passed the law it was responding to a 1990
ruling that an individual's religious beliefs do not excuse him
from complying with otherwise valid laws, so long as those laws
are being applied to all citizens in a neutral and general way.</p>

<p>That case involved two Native Americans who were fired at a
private Oregon rehabilitation center after they ingested peyote,
a cactus that contains the hallucinogen mescaline, during a
religious ceremony. The state denied the men unemployment
benefits based on the fact they engaged in illegal drug use. The two men,
asserting their religious rights had been violated, won in lower
state courts, but the Supreme Court ruled against them.</p>

<p>Writing for the five-justice majority, Justice Antonin Scalia
refused to use a test from earlier cases that required a state to
prove it had a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in enforcing a
statute that infringed on religious practices.</p>

<p>That test put more of the burden on governments to defend
regulations that interfere with religious beliefs.</p>

<p>In the weeks and months following the decision, a diverse
coalition of religious and civil liberties groups lobbied
Congress to reverse effects of the ruling, saying it would particularly
hurt smaller religions whose interests might not be understood by legislatures.</p>

<p>&quot;When a law begins to infringe on a church, no matter how
incidentally, that is not consistent with religious
liberty,&quot; said Laycock, a University of Texas law professor involved
in pressing Congress to overturn the ruling in Employment Division
v. Smith.</p>

<p>In 1993, Congress overwhelmingly approved and President
Clinton signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.</p>

<p>The central provision of the law attempts to write into
statute what the court refused to find in the Constitution.</p>

<p>It says government may interfere with religious practices only
if it can demonstrate the regulation or action in question
furthers a &quot;compelling governmental interest&quot; and is
the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.</p>

<p>In the case of City of Boerne v. Flores now before the
justices, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit rejected
claims Congress had overstepped its authority when it passed the
law.</p>

<p>The appeals court said Congress correctly relied on Section 5
of the Fourteenth Amendment, which says Congress &quot;shall have
power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the
provisions&quot; of the amendment protecting against state
infringement on individual rights.</p>

<p>The appeals court also rejected the city of Boerne's arguments
Congress had breached state sovereignty and crossed the line
separating church and state.</p>

<p>In Boerne's appeal, supported by 16 states, the city stressed
there are limits to Congress's exercise of so-called Section 5
powers and it is the court, not federal lawmakers, who are
arbiters of the breadth of constitutional protections.</p>

<p>Locally, the statute has spurred numerous lawsuits. In June, a
federal district judge in Maryland ruled the law is
unconstitutional in connection with the Archdiocese of Baltimore's
efforts to demolish an abandoned monastery in Cumberland that
city officials wanted to preserve. The case is on appeal to the 4th
Circuit.</p>

<p>In another case, a federal judge in the District relied on the
law to overrule the D.C. Zoning Board after the board refused to
allow a Foggy Bottom church to run a soup kitchen that neighbors
had protested.</p>

<p>Prisoners also have used the law to claim they need special
accommodations to fulfill religious traditions. Fears of such
litigation allegedly led guards at the District's Lorton
Correctional Complex to allow visitors posing as religious missionaries
to meet unsupervised with prisoners. It was later revealed the visitors
were smuggling drugs into the prison.</p>

<p>Oliver Thomas, special counsel to the National Council of
Churches and one of the leaders who pressed Congress to pass the
law, said yesterday the Texas dispute was a good one for the high court
to take up.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not one of those cases involving some Satan
worshiper in a federal prison,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a small
congregation that has so many people they can't fit in the sanctuary.
It's about as pristine a case as you could come up with.&quot;</p>

<p>The case is likely to be argued in January and decided by
July.</p>

<p>Separately yesterday, the justices without comment rejected an
appeal by pathologist Jack Kevorkian of a lower court ruling that
bars him from helping terminally ill patients commit suicide.</p>

<p>Earlier this month the court announced it would use two other
cases to decide whether mentally competent, terminally ill
patients may seek help from their doctors in hastening death.</p>

<p>The court yesterday also agreed to rule on whether states may
tax the income of hospitals run by employee welfare benefit plans
and whether a Florida state Senate district was unlawfully drawn along
racial lines to favor blacks.</p>

<h2>Iowa Group studying industrial hemp as crop</h2>

<p><font size="4"><strong>A Farm Bureau</strong> resolution
supports research of the crop, which was widely grown in Iowa
before being outlawed in 1937.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">The Iowa Farm Bureau Federation wants to look
into adding industrial hemp, a cousin of the marijuana plant,
into Iowa's crop rotation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">On Tuesday, Farm Bureau delegates meeting in
Des Moines voiced tentative approval of a resolution supporting
research of industrial hemp, which was widely grown in Iowa
before a 1937 federal law outlawed its cultivation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">Industrial hemp has much less of the
psychoactive chemical THC than its cousin in the cannabis family
known as marijuana, said Bondurant farmer Tom Towers, who
introduced the resolution Tuesday.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">&quot;This is not the kind of hemp you smoke,
folks,&quot; Towers said in introducing the resolution. &quot;We know
marijuana isn't such a hot item, but industrial hemp has had the
hallucinogens removed so you can inhale it if you want.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">Bill Horan, a Calhoun County farmer, said the
American Farm Bureau Federation approved a similar resolution at
its annual meeting last January.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">&quot;We want Iowa State University to get
started doing the research,&quot; Horan said.&nbsp; &quot;In
1937, when hemp was outlawed, all the seedstock and germplasm was
destroyed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">Other countries, most notably Germany, are far
ahead of the United States in growing hemp for industrial uses,
Horan said, and other states have research projects going.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">&quot;We need to catch up,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">Industrial hemp is worth looking into as a
possible way to diversify agriculture and add another cash crop
to Iowa's Big Two crops of corn and soybeans.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">&quot;We may be on to a legitimate third crop
here,&quot; Horan said.&nbsp; Horan said the United States used to
grow a lot of hemp for industrial use.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">The Declaration of Independence was written on
paper made from hemp, he said, and Henry Ford made a car body out
of soybeans and hemp.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">Paper made from hemp can last 1,500 years, he
said, while paper from wood pulp lasts just 25 years.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">The Farm Bureau resolution was promoted by
Roger Gipple of Des Moines, who owns farmland and is a member of
several farm and environmental organizations.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">Gipple said industrial hemp can be grown
without pesticides, unlike cotton, and is better for the environment.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">&quot;As environmentalists, we've prohibited
farmers from doing so many things,&quot; Gipple said.&nbsp; &quot;Here's
something they can do.&nbsp; We can give them hope instead of
fear.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">And, he said, rural communities could process
the hemp into industrial products and create jobs in Iowa's small
towns.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">&quot;This could be the basis of a whole new
value-added industry in rural communities,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=+4><B>Revival of hemp industry at hand?</B></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Some say</B> the weed, once produced widely in Iowa as a contribution to the WWII effort, could be a valuable crop here again.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>By GEORGE ANTHAN</B>
<BR>The Register's Washington Bureau Chief

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Washington, D.C.</B> -- Iowans were startled in the mid-1960s when newspaper headlines proclaimed that cannabis sativa, better known as marijuana, was growing on the Statehouse grounds.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, it shouldn't have been a surprise -- and it most likely wasn't a plot by counterculture forces to embarrass the state.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was simply that cannabis, also better known for centuries as hemp, had been produced widely in Iowa as a patriotic (and profitable) contribution to the World War II effort.  It was part of a program to provide vital rope and sheeting for the Navy.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; And the seeds of this hardy weed simply had stayed around, even after hemp production was prohibited, popping up in ditches, at the edges of fields -- and on the Statehouse grounds.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, some farmers and agricultural researchers are trying to re-establish the hemp industry in the United States, contending it can be highly profitable.

<P><B>Iowa a Garden Spot</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The move to resurrect hemp output is centered in Colorado, Missouri and Kentucky, but agricultural experts agree that Iowa represents ideal growing conditions for cannabis.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, delegates to this year's national convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation voted overwhelmingly in favor of research into revival of an industrial hemp industry in the United States.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States currently imports a small amount of raw hemp from the Philippines, Britain and China for processing into a variety of products.  Hemp advocates say many more finished hemp-containing products are imported -- products that could be produced here.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Industrial hemp, its proponents contend, doesn't offer the euphoric impact of marijuana because it contains less than 1 percent of the chemical THC, which produces the effects.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been periodic reports since World War II of attempts to harvest wild-growing hemp in Iowa and to convert it to smokable material.  But self-described "experts" say it's highly inferior, if not downright repellent, as a drug.

<P><B>Paper, Canvas, Cloth</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cannabis fiber, which is separated from the plant's stem, is essential to the manufacture of certain kinds of cordage and also is used in making paper, canvas and a popular cloth for clothing.  Oil from the plant is manufactured into caulking material, paint, plastics, varnish and soap.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hemp was a major crop in the southeastern United States until the mid-19th century, when cheaper imports began arriving.  But it became a vital crop in the Midwest, especially in north-central Iowa, as World War II cut off overseas supplies.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; A 1943 report in The Des Moines Register notes: "Growing the weed as a crop looked a little silly to some farmers at first.  Many were skeptical.  They had known hemp only as marijuana, a harmful narcotic, a weed smoked by drug addicts."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The report continued: "Government men told farmers the war had cut off imports of Manila hemp and sisal fiber" and that "farmers need not worry about growing a narcotic."  By the end of the war, more than 4,000 Iowa farmers were growing hemp on tens of thousands of acres, with prices guaranteed by the government.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Herbert Howell, a farm management specialist at Iowa State University from 1934 until 1973, said in addition to promoting hemp production, the government set up about a dozen hemp processing plants in Iowa during the war.

<P><B>A Surprise</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; ISU economist Neil Harl, who grew up on an Iowa farm, said: "I was a kid then, but we viewed it as part of the war effort, and it was a surprise to many law-abiding Iowa citizens to learn it had another use."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Winter, a northeastern Colorado farmer and president of the Weld county Farm Bureau, is a leading advocate of an industrial hemp industry and contends the Justice Department's Drug Enforcement Administration is "brainwashing state legislators and local law enforcement officials into opposing the move.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Winter said international trade treaties signed by the United States say that any hemp with less than three-tenths of 1 percent THC shall be considered industrial hemp, and not marijuana.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "But current U.S. law does not differentiate between industrial hemp and marijuana," he said.  "Thanks to these laws, the U.S. lags behind other world powers in hemp production and must import raw hemp pulp for manufacture here."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Winter and the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project, which he helped organize, estimate that industrial hemp producers would reap a profit of more than $500 an acre, based on current prices.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everybody agrees this is a good idea except the drug enforcement people," he said.

<P><B>Potential Reflected</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dennis Stolte, a Farm Bureau official here, said the group's backing of industrial hemp "was a bit of a surprise to a lot of us.  It shows the potential for hemp and reflects farmers' looking for alternative crops."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Stolte said hemp "grows like a weed, with very little need for pesticides or cultivation.  And its water needs are not very great."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; In a recent publication, the Farm Bureau says that many new varieties of the cannabis sativa plant available in Europe contain less than three tenths of 1 percent THC and that "European farmers have been growing hemp for over 20 years without any problems related to marijuana."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the DEA hasn't budged.  Agency officials here said hemp is just another name for marijuana although federal law does exclude from the "marijuana" designation the stalks and fibers from hemp plants and products manufactured from these fibers.

Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture, 1913, Washington,
Government Printing Office, 1914.  Lyster H. Dewey, &quot;Hemp&quot;  pp. 283-346. 
Illustrated.  One of the most thorough studies on the commercial,
agricultural, industrial uses of hemp, Cannabis sativa L., ever written. 
Covers soil type, history, world production in 1913, development of better
varieties, uses of hemp for fiber, seed, and as a rotation crop easy on the
soil and resistant to pests and as a method to control weeds.  Explains the
agronomy of hemp in many countries of the world in 1913.  A classic.

U.S.D.A. Bulltein #404, Washington, Government Printing Office, 1916,
Lyster Dewey and Jason Merrill, &quot;Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material.&quot; 
Discusses the manufacture of paper from the inner portion of the hemp
stalk, the xylem fibers or hurds.  Dewey and Merrill established that one
acre of hemp had the cellulose equivalent of 4.05 acres of trees on a
yearly sustainable basis.  This bulletin of 25 pages was actually printed
on paper made from hemp hurds.

The Schlichten Papers, Don Wirtschafter, 1994, Athens, Ohio.  Letters and
correspondence between George Schlichten, inventor of a new hemp fiber
decorticator, and representatives of the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain
considering the possibilities of hemp as a source for newsprint.  Includes
patent office drawings and details of this important invention from 1917. 

Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin #221, June 27, 1919, 
pp21-43, &quot;Marketing Hemp,&quot; John R. Humphrey.  Attempts to show the American
hemp producer how to more effectively market his product so as to compete
with foreign competition.  Need for better quality and mechanization
discussed.  Illustrated.

Plant Physiology, Vol 11, 1936,  &quot;Time Factor in Utilization of Mineral
Nutrients by Hemp,&quot;  Sister Mary Etienne Tibeau, pp. 731-747.  A nun from
Mount Mercy College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, did extensive studies on the
proper mineral nutrients to add to hemp for maximum growth and production.

Proceedings--Soil Science Society of America, Black, C.A., Vessel. A.J.,
1944, &quot;The Response of hemp to fertilizers in Iowa.&quot;  pp.179-184.  Shows
crop yields in Iowa during the governments emergency program to grow hemp
during World War II.  One test plot had a yield of 21.2 tons per acre. 
Nitrogen added at a rate of 100 pounds per acre increased hemp yields by
2.47 tons.  Nitrogen also increased the number of female plants.  

U.S.D.A. Bulltein #1935, Brittain B. Robinson, 1943, revised 1952, &quot;Hemp.&quot; 
Shows farmers how to plant, grow, harvest, and ret hemp.  Given to American
farmers during World War II because our foreign sources of cordage fibers
were cut off by the Japanese.  Re-issued in 1952 during the Korean War when
it was feared that our sources of foreign fibers might be cut off by the
Communist Chinese.

Iowa Academy of Sciences, Vol. 58, 1951,  pp. 221-228, &quot;Nutrition and
Aeration in relation to growth in Cannabis sativa,&quot;  John R. Weber.

Botanical Gazette, &quot;Photoperiodic Responses of Hemp,&quot;  Vol. 116, Sept.
1954,  pp. 14-29, Borthwick, H.A., Scully, N.J.  Photoperiod investigations
were undertaken in order to improve methods of field production of hemp.

Fibres, Engineering and Chemistry,  &quot;Monoecious hemp breeding in the United
States.&quot;1956, Vol. 17, Feaster, C.V.,  pp.339-340.  Monoecious hemp has the
advantage that all plants come to maturity at the same time.  

A History of the Hemp Industry in Kentucky, 1951, James F. Hopkins,
University of Kentucky, Lexington.  A very thorough book on hemp's history
in the number one hemp producing state.  Sen. Henry Clay was one of the
largest hemp producers in America .

America, Russia, Hemp, and Napoleon,&quot;  Alfred Crosby, 1965, reveals how
hemp was one of the main causes of the War of 1812 when Napoleon formed an
alliance with the czar of Russia which cut off Great Britain's access to
Russian hemp.  At that time nearly all the marine hemp used in the world
came from Russia.

Pharmacological Reviews,  Vol.23, No. 4, 1971, &quot;Chemistry of Marihuana,&quot; 
Coy Waller.  One of the first studies that clearly shows that hemp-type
marihuana grown for fiber is very low in THC, the psychoactive component
that gets people high.  The drug-type marihuana is very high in THC.  Also
the precursor agent Cannabidiol, CBD, which is not psychoactive, is very
high in fiber-type hemp but very low in drug-type.  This is important as
CBD is known to block the effects of THC.  This makes the hemp-type doubly
useless for drug effects.

Economic Botany,  29:  April-June, 1975, pp. 153-163.  &quot;Seasonal
Fluctuations in Cannabinoid Content of Kansas Marijuana,&quot;  R.P. Latta, and
B.J. Eaton.  Wild  'marijuana' growing in Riley County Kansas was found to
be very low in THC content.  The leaves and flowering tops averaged from
0.01-0.49% THC with a mean of 0.14% THC.  CBD which blocks the psychoactive
effects of THC was as high as 1.7% (Average marijuana seized by law
enforcement agencies is  about 3-3.5% THC.) 

Economic Botany,  29:  1975,  &quot;The Evolution of Cannabinoid Phenotypes in
Cannabis,&quot;  Ernest Small, H.D. Beckstead, and Allan Chan,  pp.  219-232. 
These researchers for the Canadian Department of Agriculture tested over
350 varieties of Cannabis in Ottawa, Ontario.  They determined that there
were two basic types of Cannabis based on genetic characteristics:  a
drug-type which originates in hot climates such as India and is high in THC
but low in CBD and a fiber-type hemp which originates in temperate climates
and is low in THC but high in CBD and is used industrially for fiber and
food.  This awareness of the separateness of the two types has vast
agronomic potential.  It means fiber hemp can be grown without the drug
effect of 'marijuana.'

Compte Rendu Academie Agriculture de France,  &quot;Apercu de la Production de
Chanvre en France,&quot;  Fournier G., Paris M.R., Paris R.R.,  Vol. 62, 1976, 
pp.  1262-1270. (French).  History and current, (1976) production of hemp
(chanvre) in France.  Reveals the unfortunate connection between hemp and
the drug Cannabis.  Shows how fiber and seed hemp grown for industrial
purposes has no psychoactive effect.  Gives current yields and shows where
hemp is grown in France.  Interestingly hemp is used as a wind-break in the
hedgerows of the Rhone River valley.  Used as fish bait.  Various uses for
hemp in specialty papers.

produced half the world's hemp after World War II with 560,000 tons per
annum.  Hemp's subsequent decline caused by l) competition from synthetic
fibers, 2) no technical improvement in hemp harvesting equipment  or
machinery for the separation of the long fibres from the woody core,  3) 
limited economic use of the short fibres of the woody core which account
for 2/3 of the whole plant.  Diagram of a hemp mill that does not require a

(French)  10 mg. of THC is required to get a psychoactive effect from
'marijuana.'  It would require 50-100 cigarettes of the French hemp
cultivated for paper to get a psychoactive high.

monoecious hemp grown in France can be distinguished by two chemotypes. 
The study indicates that the plants higher in THC can be selected out of
the population.  If so the THC content can be reduced to 0.03% THC.  The
first results are encouraging.

Further advances the study to reduce THC content of French monoecious hemp,
variety Fibrimon 56, to the lowest THC possible.  Also gives a history of
the hemp industry in France and current production and uses for hemp. 
Formerly France produced over 1/2 million acres of hemp.  Today that
production is down to 25,000 acres and is mostly used for specialty papers.
 The hemp seed is used in commercial animal feeds and as bait for fish.

<P>Irish have high hopes for cannabis, fuel of the future
<BR>BY AUDREY MAGEE, IRELAND CORRESPONDENT
<DD>CANNABIS will light up thousands of Irish homes by replacing Irish peat as a vital fuel to generate electricity.&nbsp;  A fast-growing strain is said to be a perfect new crop for European farmers.
<DD>Scientists in Carlow, southwest of Dublin, have been growing cannabis in a secret area for the past four years, testing its properties as an energy source to burn in power stations.&nbsp;  James Burke, who has grown three acres under licence from the Department of Justice, said that the plant flourished in Irish conditions, growing up to a height of 14ft.
<DD>It is a strain developed in France for agricultural use.&nbsp;  Called <I>Cannabis sativa</I> L, also known as hemp, it is essentially the same plant smoked by drug users, but modern science has removed the narcotic element.&nbsp;  [I wish we could stop spreading this baloney--dpw]
<DD>"There is no possibility of everyone getting stoned from the fumes of a power station because the cannabis has no chemical constituent," said Dr. Burke, who works at Teagasc, the agriculture and food development authority part-funded by the Government.
<DD>"Despite the name, it bears no resemblance to the other plant.&nbsp;  You would have to smoke five or six acres of the stuff to get a high."
<DD>The plant has a slightly minty smell.&nbsp;  Stringy fibres inside the stem burn as well as wood and yield similar energy levels, but the cannabis is easier and faster to grow than wood and dries out more quickly.&nbsp;  A typical growing season lasts six months, from April to September.
<DD>The fibres can also be used to make fine paper, canvas shoes or car bumpers.&nbsp;  Ireland intends to be the first country to use it to generate electricity.
<DD>The Government is holding an international competition to find the best design for a biomass power plant, which would burn cannabis, waste paper and chicken droppings.&nbsp;  The plant could be in operation by 1999, generating electricity for more than 30,000 homes 1 per cent of Ireland's total energy needs.
<DD>Dr. Burke said that Cannabis sativa would be a perfect alternative crop for farmers curtailed from producing more food for the European Union.&nbsp;  At 3190 an acre, it is 350 cheaper to produce than wheat or barley.&nbsp;  Ireland's planned use of cannabis is a far cry from the staple fuel of bog peat which has warmed Irish houses for generations.&nbsp;  But the bog is running out.&nbsp;  There are 1.2 million hectares of bog in Ireland, 8 per cent of them owned by Bord na Mona, the national peat cultivator.&nbsp;  Peat accounts for 12 per cent of the fuel used to generate electricity, fourth to coal, gas and oil.&nbsp;  Bord na Mona says it has sufficient resources for another 30 years, after which its contribution to the national grid would dwindle.
<DD>Humans have been using hemp to make ropes and baskets for at least 6,000 years.&nbsp;  The plant is widely grown in India and throughout Eastern Europe.&nbsp;  Its main use is as a source of fibre used for twine, rope and string, and for coarse sacking and canvas.
<DD>The plant, an annual grown from seed, can grow up to a height of 16ft.&nbsp;  In dense cultivation it usually reaches between 7ft and 10ft.&nbsp;  The seeds are a source of oil used to make paints, varnishes, soaps and, more commonly, birdseed.&nbsp;  The narcotic chemicals are usually found in the leaves and blossoms.

<h2 align="center">Hemp Foods ... Beyond the Soybean</h2>

<h3>What is Hemp?</h3>

<p>Hemp is Cannabis Sativa, but a different strain than
Marijuana. Hemp has been cultivated for thousands of years in
temperate climates, Marijuana in tropical climates. Although once
thought to be different plants, they are now considered different
strains of the same plant. Hemp produces very little T.H.C. (the
drug that produces the &quot;high&quot;), Marijuana produces much
more. </p>

<p>Hemp fiber has been used for 9,000 years, first in China. Its
fiber is used for rope, canvas, clothing, and paper. It is
considered the best raw material for these basic commodities,
easy to work with and strong. (in fact, the word
&quot;canvas&quot; is derived from &quot;cannabis.&quot;) </p>

<p>When America's founding fathers planned liberation from
England they knew that an independent suppy of fiber for paper,
ropes, ship sails, and clothing was critical. Therefore they grew
Hemp with great enthusiasm. Even the Declaration of Indep endence
was written on Hemp paper, and the first U.S. flags were made of
Hemp. Yes, Hemp is as American as Apple Pie, Betsy Ross, and the American
Flag! </p>

<p>Hemp can also be used to make paint, lumber, charcoal,
lubricants, batting, plastics, fuel, and cooking oil. In fact,
Henry Ford once made a car that used Hemp to make body panels and upholstery.
Hemp was a significant part of the U.S. and wor ld agriculture
and industry, until being caught in the rising tide of
manufactured sentiment against its cousin, Marijuana, in 1937. </p>

<p>Hemp can be grown all over North America, and grows especially
well where tobacco is now planted. (in our country's early years
Kentucky consistently had the tallest Hemp plants.) Hemp roots
help control erosion, it has few pests and is very ha rdy. Paper
from hemp requires no dioxin to bleach it (unlike wood paper).
&quot;Hemp for Victory&quot; was a World War II campaign to get
U.S. farmers to grow Hemp for use in the war effort. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture even made an instructional film for
farmers growing Hemp. Today, domestic cu ltivation of Hemp would
improve our economy and environment by reducing our need for
petroleum, trees, and imported textiles. </p>

<p>Hemp Seeds are high in the essential fatty acids Omega-3
Linolenic Acid and Omega-6 Linoleic Acid, and Super Omega-6
Linoleic Acid, in &quot;Nature's perfect balance&quot; (according
to Dr. Udo Erasmus). They also contain 23% complete protein, and
35% fi ber. Hemp Seeds make superior bird seed and have been
imported foryears by seed companies (of course, the seeds must
first be sterilized by exposure to 160 F degrees steam for 5
minutes in order to be legal). The seeds contain no T.H.C. </p>

<h3>What are Hemp Foods?</h3>

<p>Foods made from Hemp are usually snacks that contain whole
Hemp Seeds. However, Sharon's Finest of Santa Rosa California, is
using the Hemp Seeds in the same way they have used soybeans for
14 years. The firm produces HempRella (TM) cheese alte rnative
containing 5% milled Hemp Seeds (similar to their TofuRella
cheese alternative) and Hempeh (TM) Burger, which is a
soybean-and-rice tempeh burger that contains 10% whole Hemp
Seeds. The future of Hemp Foods lies in using Hemp Seeds to make
a n emulsion (analogous to soymilk from the soybean) which can
then be used to make milk, yogurt, ice cream, tofu, cheese, meat
alternatives, and the like. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, sterilizing them makes Hemp Seeds much harder
to work with and reduces nutritional value somewhat. </p>

<h3>If it's so good then why is Hemp illegal?</h3>

<p>In 1937 Congress passed the &quot;Marijuana Tax Act&quot;
without so much as a roll call vote. The <i>Virginia Law Review</i>
called the hearings on the matter a &quot;near comic example of
dereliction of legislative responsibility.&quot; It noted that no
primary empirical evidence was presented about the drug ...
[only] hearsay and emotional pleas&quot;, and that the law
&quot;was tied neither to scientific study nor law enforcement
need.&quot; The prestigious law journal concluded that Congress
was &quot;hoodwinked.&quot; But why? </p>

<p>Powerful timber and chemical interests had good reason to
curtail Hemp, their most formidable competitor. Working with a
California newspaper publisher who had lost 22,000 acres of
timber land to Marijuana-smoking Mexican Revolutionaries, the f
ix was in. Fabricated and exaggerated stories were published
about the &quot;killer&quot; weed Marijuana, and public sentiment
turned. It was then easy to get Congress to ban Cannabis,
including both Marijuana, and its innocent cousin Hemp, with nary
a whimper from the public (bird seed and paint makers were
exempted from the law). Aiding from within the federal
bureaucracy was the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, in imminent danger
of having its budget slashed. Its director was able to seize the
threat of this new drug menace to expand its budget and
importance. The dirty deed was done, and not coincidentally soon
thereafter Du Pont Chemical Co. introduced new chemicals to
replace Hemp in industry, including Nylon. In 1970 Marijuana was
made a Schedule I Controlled Substance with &quot;no medical
use&quot; whatsoever, unavailable even for legitimate medical
use. </p>

<p>In June 1994 President Clinton signed an Executive Order
promoting &quot;strategic commodities,&quot; including Hemp. This
Order makes official the federal government's interest in making
viable domestic production of certain commodities that are
importe d, so that in the event of war or shipping interruptions
we won't be caught short of products made from those commodities.
The inclusion of Hemp in the Order proves the potential Hemp has
for industry. </p>

<p>Today, there is proof Marijuana is very useful in treating a
variety of medical conditions, and Hemp fiber and seeds can be
used widely and profitably as well. So why are very ill, terminal
patients arrested for using medically-indicated Mariju ana? And
why is it still illegal to use Hemp Seeds if they aren't
sterilized, even though viable seeds have no danger of abuse? </p>

<h3><a name="definition">I. Definition</a></h3>

<p>Industrial hemp means those parts of the Cannabis sativa plant
which contain less than 1.00% tetrahydrocannabinols (THC). THC is
the psychoactive chemical found in Cannabis sativa. Industrial
hemp is not to be confused with marijuana. Marijuana comes from
the flowers of the Cannabis sativa plant and contains more than
1.00% THC.<a href="#1">1</a> Industrial hemp has no psychoactive properties. </p>

<p>Industrial hemp can be grown as a profitable, high-quality
fiber crop without producing marijuana. Registered seed varieties
that produce hemp containing less than 0.3% THC even in the
flowers are available throughout Europe.<a href="#2">2</a>
Farmers in the European Community have been growing hemp for over
20 years without any problems related to marijuana.<a href="#3">3</a> </p>

<h3><a name="abroad">II. Hemp Production in Other Countries</a></h3>

<p>Industrial hemp is grown as a profitable fiber crop in many
countries.<a href="#4">4</a> Industrial hemp crops have been
subsidized in the European Community since before 1988.<a
href="#5">5</a> In 1993, England began to produce hemp for fiber.<a
href="#6">6</a> In 1994, Canada harvested its first crop of
industrial hemp after more than 50 years of prohibition.<a
href="#7">7</a> The re-emerging world hemp industry is growing
steadily, and farmers are excited and enthusiastic about the
potential of hemp crops. </p>

<h3><a name="us">III. Hemp Production in the United States</a></h3>

<p>Hemp has been valued throughout this country's history as an
important raw material. Until the late 1800s, almost all of our
cloth was made from hemp, and virtually all of our paper was made
from hemp rags.<a href="#8">8</a> From 1631 to the early 1800s,
hemp was such a valued commodity that it was considered legal
tender (money).<a href="#9">9</a> Regions of Kentucky and
Wisconsin were among the largest hemp producers.<a href="#10">10</a> </p>

<p>Hemp production seemed destined to increase dramatically in
the 1930s, when an invention called the decorticator began
getting wide attention.<a href="#11">11</a> The decorticator
strips the hemp fiber from the stalk. This had been the most
labor-intensive and expensive part of producing hemp.<a
href="#12">12</a> The decorticator was to hemp what the cotton
gin was to cotton. The invention prompted a 1937 Popular
Mechanics magazine to call hemp the &quot;New Billion Dollar
Crop&quot;<a href="#13">13</a> and Mechanical Engineering
magazine to call it &quot;The Most Desirable Crop That Can Be
Grown.&quot;<a href="#14">14</a> </p>

<p>However, the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act dealt a fatal blow to the
promising hemp fiber industry. The Act established a prohibitive
tax on hemp manufacturers and distributors as well as on hemp transactions.<a
href="#15">15</a> It was modeled after a similar tax that was
enacted to prohibit machine guns. The transfer tax of $1.00/ounce
effectively ended all hemp production in the United States by
making commerce in hemp prohibitively expensive. </p>

<p>Restrictions on hemp production were eased briefly in the
United States during World War II when Japan invaded the
Philippines, cutting off the supply of abaca (Manila hemp).<a
href="#16">16</a> The U.S. Navy desperately needed a domestic
supply of hemp to provide the lines and rigging for its fleet. The
U.S. Department of Agriculture encouraged farmers to produce hemp
for the war effort by distributing a film called &quot;Hemp for
Victory!&quot;.<a href="#17">17</a> </p>

<p>After World War II, the hemp industry declined as the federal
government again began to restrict hemp production.<a href="#18">18</a>
Farmers continued to produce hemp on a limited scale until the
1950s.<a href="#19">19</a> However, legislation eventually came
to treat industrial hemp crops as marijuana (drug) crops, and hemp
fiber production was no longer promoted. </p>

<p>Currently, hemp production is treated as a felony in the
United States because it is assumed that all hemp crops will
produce marijuana. With the advent of industrial hemp and low-THC
seed varieties, this is no longer true. Hemp can now be grown as
a profitable fiber crop in the United States with absolutely no
danger of increasing marijuana use. </p>

<h3><a name="raw-product">IV. Raw Materials and Products from
Hemp</a></h3>

<p>Hemp consists of three principal raw materials: fiber, seeds,
and hurds. Hemp is principally grown for the bast fiber it
produces from its stalk. However, the seeds and hurds are also
important economically. </p>

<ol>
    <li><h4><a name="raw-product.1">Fiber:</a></h4>
        <p>The hemp stalk is composed of 20% fiber.<a href="#20">20</a>
        Hemp is the strongest natural fiber in the world.<a
        href="#21">21</a> It is valued for its strength and
        durability when used for textiles, cordage, and paper. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Textiles: The fiber can be made into any type of
                cloth, from the finest linen to the coarsest
                canvas.<a href="#22">22</a> The word canvas comes
                from the Arabic word for hemp.<a href="#23">23</a> Cloth
                made from hemp fiber is stronger, warmer, more
                durable, more absorbent, and softer than cotton.<a
                href="#24">24</a></li>
            <li>Cordage: Hemp rope has been valued throughout
                history for its superior strength and resistance
                to deterioration in salt or fresh water.<a
                href="#25">25</a></li>
            <li>Paper: Paper made from hemp is known as the
                &quot;archivist's perfect paper&quot; because it lasts
                much longer than tree pulp paper and does not
                harden, crack, yellow, or crumble with age.<a
                href="#26">26</a> Hemp fiber can be used to make
                every grade of paper.<a href="#27">27</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4><a name="raw-product.2">Hurds:</a></h4>
        <p>The hemp stalk is composed of 80% hurds.<a href="#28">28</a>
        The hurds are the woody inner portion of the hemp stalk
        that are separated from the hemp fiber.<a href="#29">29</a>
        The hurds are 50% - 77% cellulose,<a href="#30">30</a>
        which makes them ideal for use in paper and plastic
        products. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Paper: One acre of hemp hurds can make as much
                pulp for paper as four acres of trees.<a
                href="#31">31</a> Hemp paper can be whitened
                without producing dioxins and lasts much longer
                than paper made from trees.<a href="#32">32</a></li>
            <li>Particle Board: Hemp hurds can be pressed and
                injected with phenolic resin to make a particle
                board that is resistant to fire and water.<a
                href="#33">33</a> The board also makes a good insulation
                and thermal barrier.<a href="#34">34</a></li>
            <li>Plastic: Plastics were first made from plant
                cellulose (i.e., cellophane, celluloid).<a
                href="#35">35</a> The hemp hurd is one of the
                richest sources of plant cellulose,<a href="#36">36</a>
                a building block of modern industry. Plastics
                made from hemp instead of petroleum would be biodegradable.<a
                href="#37">37</a></li>
            <li>Animal Bedding: The hurds make an excellent
                animal bedding because they absorb more liquid
                and compost faster than wood shavings.<a
                href="#38">38</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4><a name="raw-product.3">Seed:</a></h4>
        <p>The hemp seed is composed of two raw materials: the
        seed oil and the seed cake.</p>
        <h5>Seed Oil:</h5>
        <p>The hemp seed is composed of 30% oil.<a href="#39">39</a> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Food: Hemp seed oil contains over 70%
                cholesterol-fighting essential fatty acids, the highest
                of any seed oil.<a href="#40">40</a></li>
            <li>Fuel: Hemp seed oil can be chemically combined
                easily with 15% methanol to provide a premium
                diesel fuel substitute.<a href="#41">41</a><p>This
                hemp bio-diesel fuel burns 70% cleaner than
                petroleum diesel in soot and particulate
                pollution.<a href="#42">42</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>Paints and varnishes: Hemp seed oil dries quickly
                and leaves a thin elastic film.<a href="#43">43</a></li>
            <li>Lubricant: Hemp seed oil makes an ideal
                all-purpose lubricant.<a href="#44">44</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Seed Cake:</h5>
        <p>The seed cake is the solid part of the seeds that
        remains after the oil is expelled.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Food: Hemp seed cake makes a nutritional,
                high-protein supplement to wheat flour. It contains
                25% protein.<a href="#45">45</a> </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Whole Seed:</h5>
        <p>The whole hemp seed contains 20% high-quality
        digestible complete protein.<a href="#46">46</a> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Food: The hemp seed can be eaten as a nutritious
                snack, like sunflower seeds.</li>
            <li>Bird Feed: Birds like hemp seed because of its
                nourishing, oily content.<a href="#47">47</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="econ">V. Economics of Hemp Production</a></h3>

<p>A hemp crop could be sold for at least $860 per acre. Since a
hemp crop produces three different raw materials each year, the
total value of hemp far exceeds other crops grown for a single
material.</p>

<p>The chart below compares yields of hemp and comparable crops.
Since there are currently no domestic hemp crops being sold in
the United States, the prices for comparable crops were used to
estimate the prices for domestic hemp fiber, hurds, and seed.</p>

<p>Hemp fiber is compared to cotton for textile production. Hemp
hurds are compared to wood chip prices and Douglas fir yield for
paper production. Hemp seed is compared to soybeans for oil seed production.</p>

<p>Production costs were not factored into this estimate,
although hemp would be considerably less expensive to produce
than cotton (see Section VI -- Hemp Cultivation).</p>

     * The hemp yields are based on historical and limited
current figures.  These are conservative estimates; the actual
yields will probably be 2 to 3 times higher.  Hemp prohibition
has stifled contemporary research in the field of hemp
production.

<h3><a name="cultivation">VI. Hemp Cultivation</a></h3>

<p>Hemp is easy to grow.<a href="#50">50</a> Hemp is an annual
herbaceous crop that grows from 5 to 16 feet tall in a season of
four months.<a href="#51">51</a> It will grow in all 50 states.<a
href="#52">52</a> It is a good rotation crop.<a href="#53">53</a>
Hemp has long roots that penetrate and break the soil to leave it
in perfect condition for the next crop.<a href="#54">54</a></p>

<p>Production costs for hemp would be considerably lower than
cotton's. Herbicides are not needed because fiber hemp is sown
thickly and chokes out competing weeds.<a href="#55">55</a>
Pesticide use is limited because hemp has few insect enemies.<a
href="#56">56</a></p>

<h3><a name="market">VII. Current Hemp Market in the United
States</a></h3>

<p>Hundreds of entrepreneurs are now selling imported hemp
products. However, they are stifled by high prices and uncertain
availability since all of the hemp is imported from overseas.
Demand for hemp products in the U.S. is enormous. Hemp clothing
and accessories have become a fashion trend.<a href="#57">57</a>
Tree- free hemp paper is also in demand.<a href="#58">58</a> The
market has a potential of as much as $15 to $30 billion a year.<a
href="#59">59</a> </p>

<h3><a name="jobs">VIII. Potential for New Jobs</a></h3>

<p>Hemp production in Colorado would create new farming
opportunities and make Colorado farmers competitive in the global
market against countries that already grow hemp for fiber. It would
also create thousands of processing and manufacturing jobs in
such industries as textiles, plastics, pulp paper, energy,
timber, construction, and food. The retail market for tree-free
paper and building materials, for biodegradable plastics, for
soft and durable natural clothing, and for other hemp products
has huge potential. </p>

<h3><a name="benefits">IX. Benefits of Hemp Production</a></h3>

<p>Hemp will be a profitable crop for farmers because of the
volume of hemp each crop produces, the number of different
products that can be made from hemp, and the demand for hemp
products.</p>

<p>Not only is hemp profitable, but it is a desirable crop to
grow for other reasons. Hemp is a renewable and sustainable
resource. It will help shift our economy away from dwindling non-renewable
petroleum resources and help preserve our forest resources.</p>

<p><font size="4"><em>A special report.</em></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>By JUDITH MILLER</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><spacer type="horizontal" size="40">At the peak of a storm last February, several
of the nation's most gifted philosophers and political scientists
met for a weekend at the Westchester County estate of George
Soros, the Hungarian-born billionaire financier.&nbsp; As the wind
rattled the windows, Mr. Sores raised a glass in honor of his
guests and gave them a challenge: If they were to advise him on
how to spend more money each year than the Ford Foundation does
on philanthropy, much of it in the United States, what would they
suggest?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;It was an astonishing session, as well as the most
expensive philosophical tutorial anyone has ever had,&quot; said
Alan Ryan, at the time a professor at Princeton and now the
warden of New College at Oxford.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">The philosophers' weekend debate, one of several &quot;Sores
retreats,&quot; as one participant called them, was pivotal in
shaping the latest phase of Mr. Soros's extraordinary
philanthropic career.&nbsp; For after spending $1.1 billion, most
of it since 1989 trying to transform the former Soviet bloc into
thriving capitalist democracies, or what he calls &quot;open
societies,&quot; Mr. Soros, deeply concerned that America's own
open society is eroding, is bringing his philanthropy home.&nbsp; Along
the way he is shaking up the philanthropic world.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">A man who often seems to donate millions on impulse, Mr. Soros
plans to devote half his annual giving -- more than $350 million
last year, almost all of it overseas -- to five domestic issues:
immigrants' rights, death and dying, drugs, education, and
criminal justice.&nbsp; While other foundations and
philanthropists are more comfortable healing the sick, housing
the poor or feeding the hungry, Mr. Soros is unabashed in
pursuing a political agenda.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Almost single-handedly, for instance, Mr. Soros financed
successful ballot initiatives this fall in Arizona and California
to permit the use of marijuana for medical purposes.&nbsp; The
support brought furious criticism from many conservatives,
government officials and drug experts, who called it an arrogant social
experiment that they fear is a disastrous first step toward full
legalization of marijuana and other drugs.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">But Mr. Soros, who amassed most of his net worth of $2 billion by
taking huge risks in the currency and other financial markets, is
undaunted by any fury.&nbsp; He says the philosophers' weekend
reinforced his determination to greatly increase his domestic
giving -- since 1994, he has committed $90 million -- out of
concern that the conservative drift in the United States has bred
indifference to genocide abroad and to suffering and injustice at
home.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;The core of an open society is under attack in our
laissez-faire society,&quot; Mr. Soros said in an interview,
adding that he wanted to foster debate about divisive issues.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">His giving has inspired comparisons to an earlier age.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;George Soros is the only American who rivals the great
philanthropists of the 1890's -- John D. Rockefeller Sr., Andrew
Carnegie and Julius Rosenwald,&quot; said Nelson Aldrich Jr., the
editor of The American Benefactor, a quarterly, and who is
himself a cousin of the Rockefellers.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Alfred Stepan, who helped found the Central European University,
a $55 million Soros project in Budapest, noted the scale of Mr.
Soros's philanthropy, &quot;if you rank a donor by assets, Soros
is nothing said Mr. Stepan, a fellow at All Souls College at
Oxford -- the Ford Foundation, for example, which committed $342
million in 1996, has assets estimated at $8 billion.&nbsp; But,
Mr. Stepan added, &quot;if you measure it by dispensed gifts,
especially in proportion to income, Soros is the world's single
largest donor.&nbsp; Individual or foundation.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">More than sheer numbers make Mr. Soros stand out, however.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;Soros is successful because his giving is openly political
and daring,&quot; said David Rieff, a writer who serves on one of
Mr. Soros's boards.&nbsp; He is determined to use his money to
change the nation's social agenda and is tough-minded about
achieving his goals.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><u>The History</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>From Hardship<br>
Comes Toughness</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. Soros, 66, never tires of expounding, in
his Hungarian accent, often arcane theories about how the world
works -- a &quot;failed philosopher,&quot; he calls himself.&nbsp;
He studied under Sir Karl Popper, whose philosophy of &quot;Open Society,&quot;
a critique of Marx and other proponents of historical
determinism, deeply influenced his thinking.&nbsp; Of slight
build, well tanned, with silver hair, wire-rimmed glasses and
expensive suit, Mr. Soros would not stand out in a room of
multimillionaires as a multibillionaire.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">There is only a hint in his deliberately calm tone of the
toughness of someone who escaped the Nazis as a Jewish adolescent
in Budapest and immigrated to the United States in 1956 to found
an off-shore investment fund known today for its financial
brinkmanship and unparalleled success.&nbsp; Having
&quot;broken&quot; the Bank of England in 1992 by betting that
Britain would devalue the pound, Mr. Soros exudes confidence --
arrogance, some detractors call it -- a quiet certainty that his
self-made wealth makes him worthy of being listened to.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">None of his giving has created more fury than his support for a
new approach to drug policy.&nbsp; Conservative critics say that
in the guise of fostering debate about politically charged
issues, Mr. Soros is trying to impose his liberal and misguided
policy agenda on an unwitting public.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Public records show that since 1993 he has donated some $15
million to foundations and groups that favor changing the
nation's drug policies.&nbsp; Ethan A. Nadelmann, head of the
Lindesmith Center, a New York City institute founded in 1994 with
Mr. Soros's money and budgeted for $828,000 in 1996, has called
for legalization of marijuana and other drugs.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">In addition to this charitable, or tax-exempt, support, he
donated more than $1 million to the ground-breaking state ballot
initiatives on drug laws in California and Arizona, contributions
that are not tax deductible.&nbsp; Both measures were
over-whelmingly approved by voters in November.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">California's new law allows marijuana to be grown and used by
anyone, even a minor, with an oral recommendation from a doctor
to treat &quot;any other illness for which marijuana provides
relief.&quot;&nbsp; Arizona's measure allows doctors to prescribe
any of 117 banned drugs, including marijuana, LSD and heroin, for
a &quot;seriously ill or terminally ill patient.&quot;&nbsp; It
also releases prisoners serving time for personal possession of
drugs.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;Neither initiative would have made it on the ballot were it
not for George Soros,&quot; said Stu Mollrich, a consultant to
the California measure's opponents.&nbsp; Three former
Presidents, senior Clinton Administration officials, state law enforcement
officials and prominent drug and medical experts opposed one or both
measures.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">But Mr. Soros expresses no regrets and says he is ready to
support similar initiatives in other states.&nbsp; Denying that
he favors across-the-board legalization of drugs, he claims to
support &quot;rational debate&quot; about what constitutes a
&quot;saner drug policy.&quot;&nbsp; Since a drug-free America
&quot;is an unattainable dream, our policy should aim at reducing
harm connected with drugs.&quot;&nbsp; Specifically, that means &quot;saving
our jails for violent criminals and predatory drug dealers, not
nonviolent drug addicts willing to undergo treatment or the
occasional marijuana smoker,&quot; he said.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">That has not persuaded some drug-policy experts, who said Mr.
Soros had given money not for debate, but to weaken drug laws.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Herbert D. Kleber, vice president of the National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, said that
while Mr. Soros was &quot;playing around&quot; with the idea of
legalization of drugs, &quot;people will die from it.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. Soros dismisses such criticism, arguing that drug policy is
surrounded by &quot;hysteria, passion and extremism.&quot;&nbsp;
When it comes to drugs, he said, &quot;even our politicians have
become extremists by trying to cater to popular sentiment which
has been whipped up and exploited for political purposes.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. Rieff, the writer, said that Mr. Soros's lifetime of struggle
against often deadly adversaries had made him impervious to such
attacks.&nbsp; &quot;If you've fled the Nazis, fought the
Communists and battled your way to the top of the West's
financial markets, a nasty column about you in a newspaper is no
big deal,&quot; Mr. Rieff said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><u>The Motivation</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Lost Opportunities,<br>
Growing Concerns</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Aryeh Neier, the human rights advocate who is
Mr. Soros's closest adviser and president of the Open Society
Institute, the nonprofit foundation that supervises much of Mr.
Soros's domestic giving, attributed Mr. Soros's shift in focus
partly to his dismay at America's failure to &quot;seize the
revolutionary moment&quot; offered by the fall of the Berlin Wall
and collapse of the Soviet Union -- he felt the country should
have poured money into supporting democratic impulses in the
former dictatorships, Mr. Neier said.&nbsp; Then came the
genocide in Yugoslavia, with a belated American response.&nbsp;
(Mr. Soros gave $50 million in late 1992 to help alleviate the
suffering of Bosnia's tormented civilian population.)<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. Sores was further &quot;repulsed,&quot; Mr. Neier added, by
the &quot;Gingrich revolution,&quot; the triumph of conservative
Republicans in the 1994 Congressional races, which symbolized for
Mr. Soros the state's abandonment of its obligations to citizens,
particularly the poor and immigrants.&nbsp; And finally, Mr. Soros
said, he was worried about the extent to which &quot;market
values and excessive individualism&quot; were permeating the
professions of medicine, law, journalism and politics, turning
them into businesses rather than callings.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. Soros has shown little interest in achieving political change
through traditional channels.&nbsp; He gives relatively little,
by his standards, to candidates or major parties.&nbsp; His
largest contribution this year was $100,000 to the Democratic
National Committee, plus a total of $5,000 to three Senate candidates
and $500 each to 25 Congressional candidates. mostly Democrats and
a few liberal Republicans.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Nor does he assume that his giving will insure political
influence.&nbsp; &quot;I can already see the President if I want
to,&quot; he said.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Rather, Mr. Soros, like most philanthropists, seems to know that
his charitable contributions can provide even greater prominence
and control. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Yet although he has written that he indulges his &quot;messianic
fantasies&quot; through his giving, he is shrewd and sensitive
enough to the rules of democracy not to try to impose his views
directly.&nbsp; Instead, he uses his money to foster debate about
his agenda, hoping that an educated public will agree with him.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">So Mr. Soros, advised by Mr. Neier and Gara LaMarche, both
veterans of the Human Rights Watch organization, directs his
spending to wide-ranging grassroots projects that he hopes will
help transform the nation's political culture and protect
Americans from what he calls &quot;unintended consequences&quot; of
bad government policy.&nbsp; There is variety in subject and
amount:<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">* A $50 million commitment to the Emma Lazarus Fund, a project
started in September to help legal immigrants attain full
participation in American society.&nbsp; Mr. Soros described the
grant as a spontaneous response to his &quot;outrage,&quot; as an
immigrant, over the recent law denying legal immigrants several
types of public assistance and benefits.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">* A $15 million commitment for three years to the Project on
Death in America.&nbsp; The effort, headed by Kathleen M. Foley,
a doctor and senior pain specialist at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, supports projects that
enhance comfort, dignity, care and relief from pain for the
dying.&nbsp; Mr. Soros says he is trying to end America's
&quot;denial of death.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">* A $12 million commitment over three years to the Algebra
Project, which seeks to improve mathematics skills of rural and
inner-city public school students throughout the country.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">* The creation last spring of the Center on Crime, Communities
and Culture, headed by Nancy Mahon, a 32-year-old expert on
prisons.&nbsp; She has already awarded $1.4 million in grants to
more than two dozen groups to support projects like prison guard
training and research on the effect of film and television on
individual and community perceptions of crime.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">The Open Society institute board approved in principal over the
week-end $7 million more for criminal justice as part of $50
million in new pledges for 1997.&nbsp; Mr. Soros's domestic
giving is increasing exponentially -- from $15 million this year
to what Mr. Soros says will eventually be more than $100 million
a year.&nbsp; Until recently, less than 10 percent of his annual
giving was spent domestically.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><u>The Personality</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Too Restless<br>
To See It Through?</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Few grant-makers challenge the unorthodox
nature of some of Mr. Soros's giving or his usual lack of support
for either Jewish causes or traditional philanthropy.&nbsp; But
some of his critics wonder whether he can sustain his interest in
a domestic agenda.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">A fellow foundation director remarked on Mr. Soros's intellectual restlessness.&nbsp;
&quot;He focuses on something and then moves on,&quot; said the grant-maker,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.&nbsp; &quot;And he likes to
see results quickly.&nbsp; He has now chosen areas where it's
hard to see results quickly.&nbsp; Does he have the staying
power?&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. Soros says he does.&nbsp; As evidence, he points to what
foundation officers call the &quot;professionalization&quot; of
his giving, or its institutionalization.&nbsp; Last year, for
example, Mr. Soros published the first comprehensive annual
report ever on his foundations' projects.&nbsp; Mr. Neier and Mr.
LaMarche, both highly regarded professionals in the foundation
community, have insisted on strict budgets and project
evaluations.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;Soros has not surrounded himself with yes men,&quot; Mr.
Rieff said.&nbsp; &quot;They talk back; they disagree.&nbsp; And
they are running the projects, not George.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">His failures abroad also reinforced the need for greater
structure and accountability, he and his associates say.&nbsp;
His Russian foundation, for example, has undergone three
reorganizations since Mr. Soros learned that much of its budget
was diverted into Swiss bank accounts and luxury cars.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">The new emphasis on American philanthropy has resulted in an
expansion of the Open Society Institute's American staff, to more
than 160 employees today from 64 in 1994.&nbsp; But the staff is
still lean by foundation standards, and its members are not as
well paid as their philanthropic counterparts.&nbsp; The foundations'
offices on 57th Street overlooking Central Park and Carnegie Hall --
in the same building as Mr. Soros's business offices -- are
spare.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;Why would we take pay cuts and smaller offices to come to
work for a billionaire?&quot; Mr. LaMarche said.&nbsp;
&quot;Because of the chance to do truly creative, risky
giving.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Some question whether Mr. Soros, whose charity finances 50
offices and employs more than 1,000 people worldwide, is starting
up too quickly and spreading himself too thin.&nbsp; That was a
concern, Mr. LaMarche conceded.&nbsp; &quot;But all these issues
are inter-connected and must be addressed simultaneously if we
are to see results,&quot; Mr. LaMarche said.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. Soros hopes that his giving will prompt other foundations to
support such risky projects and research.&nbsp; He said he knew
that, like some of his early projects in Eastern Europe, China
and South Africa, some American projects may fail.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;I don't have all the answers,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
&quot;But I know what questions to ask.&nbsp; And after all, I
can't take it with me.&quot;</font></p>

<title>Greg Ganske - October 18, 1996</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h1>Greg Ganske: Surgeon-congressman</h1>

<h3>A gentleman scholar, policy wonk, who's also a regular guy</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>And for voters who want a congressman with some spunk,
    consider the drug-abuse talk that Ganske gave at a Council
    Bluffs high school.&nbsp; The gist: He used to treat a number
    of young men with enlarged breasts.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because frequent
    use of marijuana has a feminizing hormonal effect.&nbsp; And
    just to be sure, he examined his patients' testicles for
    shrinkage.&nbsp; His message: Don't just say no to drugs, say
    no to embarassing physical changes.</p>

<h3>Just Say ... What?</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p><spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Colleague Jon Roos reports that Congressman Greg Ganske, a
    physician, has found a good argument to use to convince young
    men not to smoke pot.&nbsp; Ganske told an audience recently
    &quot;about how marijuana has gotten stronger, how it leads
    to crack.&nbsp; ... And I wasn't sure I was getting through
    to some of the kids, so I said, 'By the way, you know when I
    was a physician, I used to take care of a fair number of
    young men who had breast enlargement.'&quot; <br>
    <spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Although that can occur naturally during puberty, Ganske
    explained, frequent use of marijuana also can have that
    effect because it contains a feminizing type of hormone. <br>
    <spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;And furthermore, if you really smoke a lot of that I
    would always examine the boys' testicles because the
    testicles can get smaller.&nbsp; So if any of you are concerned
    about getting larger breasts or smaller testicles, don't
    smoke marijuana.&quot;</p>

           IN THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE STATE OF ALASKA

               FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT AT KETCHIKAN

STATE OF ALASKA,

             Plaintiff,

        v.

PATRICK A. MC NEIL,

             Defendant.

                                No. 1KE-93-947 CR

                     <b>MEMORANDUM OF DECISION</b>

        On September 4, 1992, Officer Peratrovich of the Klawock

Police Department sighted what he believed to be a small amount of

marijuana within defendant's residence.  He saw this through a glass

door at a distance of six feet or so.  He applied for a search

warrant to return and seize this material &quot;alleging a violation of

possession.&quot;  (Tr. p. 2).  He estimated the amount to be

approximately &quot;a gram&quot; and stated it was accompanied by rolling

papers and a pipe.  (Tr. p. 4).  Service of the warrant resulted in

the seizure of this material (.21 gram) which later proved to be,

in fact, marijuana.<a href="#1">1</a>

        More than seven months later - on April 27, 1993 - defendant

was charged by complaint with a violation of AS 11.71.060(a)(1),

Misconduct Involving a Controlled Substance in the Sixth Degree,
____________________

     <a name="1">1</a>  Also located and seized during the search was a selection of
paraphernalia and a small amount of cocaine.

                                1
</pre>

<hr>

<pre>alleging the possession of marijuana.  He was subsequently indicted

July 9, 1993 for the same offense, stated as Count II of that

document.

        Defendant has moved to suppress evidence taken under the

warrant on the grounds that there was insufficient probably cause

for the issue of the warrant; the search exceeded the scope of the

warrant; and, finally, that AS 11.71.060(a)(1) violates article I,

Section 22 of the State Constitution (the right to privacy) inasmuch

as it criminalizes the personal possession of marijuana by adults

for use in one's home.  <i>Ravin v. State</i>, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).<a
href="#2">2</a>

        The attack on probable cause falls short.  The observation

of this material at six feet, in conjunction with &quot;rolling papers&quot;

and a pipe - both indicative of smoking activity - consitutes a

basis for reasonable belief that the officer has seen marijuana.

No special training would be required for most third graders to draw

this inference from the officer's testimony before the magistrate.

        Likewise, defendant gets no relief from his argument that

the officers' search warrant exceeded that authorized.  The magistrate

annotated the warrant itself &quot;Visible Rm (room) from sliding glass

door only&quot;.  A common sense reading allows a search of that room -

not only some portions of it.  All the evidence seized came from

that room although the officers did a &quot;sweep&quot; of the rest of the

<pre>home to ascertain the presence or lack of occupants - a prudent and

allowable intrusion beyond the scope of the warrant.

        This leaves the thornier issue - the criminality of

possession by adults of marijuana in the home for personal use.

Defendant is an adult (d.o.b. March 14, 1960), the residence was his

home (Tr. p. 8), and the amount and circumstances certainly suggest

only personal use.

        In 1978, the Supreme Court unanimously held that Article I,

Section 22 of the Alaska Constitution - the right to privacy -

protected the possession of marijuana by adults at home for personal

use.  <i>Ravin v. State</i>, 537 P.2d 494, 511 (Alaska 1975).  While not

finding a constitutional right to possess or use marijuana, the

Court found that &quot;no adequate justification for the state's

intrusion into the citizen's right to privacy&quot; existed or had been

shown.

        The legislature attempted to accommodate this decision in

Title 17 and later AS 11.71.060 and .070 by limiting criminal

penalties for private, in-home possession by adults to amounts of

four ounces or more.  In 1990 an initiative passed which is

reflected in current AS 11.71.060(a)(1) - criminalizing possession

of any amount of marijuana anywhere, by anyone.  The legislature has

since taken no action on this issue.

        The initiative is authorized in Article XI, Section 1 of the

                                3
</pre>

<hr>

<pre>Alasks Constitution.<a href="#3">3</a>

             The people may propose and enact
             laws by the initiative, and approve
             or reject acts of the legislature by
             the referendum.

        &quot;The right of initiative and referendum, sometimes referred

to as direct legislation, should be liberally construed to permit

exercise of that right.&quot;  <i>Thomas v. Bailey</i>, 595 P.2d 1, 3 (Alaska

1979).  Liberal construction seems to mean that defects in form

should be treated leniently.  However, courst will routinely strike

these enactments for trespass into prohibited substantive areas.

<i>See Citizens Coalition v. McAlpine</i>, 610 P.2d 162, 168 (Alaska 1991).

        As the court stated in <i>McAlpine</i>, &quot;We must never lose sight

of another important right of the people implicated in all cases of

constitutional construction, namely the right to have the

constitution upheld as the people ratified it.  <i>See</i>, <i>Thomas</i>, 595

P.2d at 3-4.  We must interpret all constitutional provisions -

grants of power and restrictions on power alike - as broadly as the

people intended them to be interpreted.&quot;  p. 168.

        In <i>State v. Lewis</i>, 559 P.2d 630 (Alaska 1977), the Court

held that the Alaska Constitution can only be amended in two ways.

Article XIII, Sections 1 and 4 set these forth - either a two thirds

affirmative vote of both legislative houses followed by approval by

a majority of voters or a constitutional convention.  In <i>Lewis</i> this

<pre>resulted in the invalidation of a proposition adopted by popular

vote - a proposition that conflicted with the constitution as

interpreted by the Court.  In other words, the voters cannot change

the constitution simply by carrying the polls on a given day.  The

initiative is designed as a means for the people to enact

legislation.  &quot;Nevertheless the subject of the initiative must

constitute such legislation as the legislative body to which it is

directed has the power to enact.&quot;  <i>Municipality of Anchorage v.</i>

<i>Frohme</i>, 568 P.2d 3, 8 (Alaska 1977); <i>Farnell v. Hesley</i>, 431 P.2d 650

(Cal. 1967) &quot;The power to legislate by initiative and referendum is,

however, subject to the same substantive constitutional limitations

as those applicable to the legislature itself.&quot;  Sutherland

Statutory Construction 4th Ed., Section 4.09; Op. of the Attorney

General 1959 #36, p. 2.

        <i>Ravin</i> was founded in the Supreme Court's interpretation of

the Alaska Constitution.  The legislature -  nor for that matter the

people through the initiative - cannot &quot;fix&quot; what it disliked in an

interpretation of that document by legislation.  The only way to

&quot;fix&quot; the Constitution is by the amendment process or a new

convention.  The initiative was inadequate to overrule Ravin and

that case remains the law.

        There is another avenue for the State to follow.  Should the

State make a clearly convincing showing that the ruling in Ravin was

in error or no longer sound due to changed conditions and that more

good than harm would result from a departure from precedent the

                                5
</pre>

<hr>

<pre>Supreme Court would reverse itself.  <i>State v. Dunlop</i>, 721 P.2d 604,

610 (Alaska 1986).  <i>Ravin</i> was decided during a period of serious

debate about the harmful effects of marijuana use.  Science marches

on.  Perhaps there is now in existence sufficient evidence in the

scientific community to persuade that Court that the State does have

an adequate justification to intrude on individual privacy in the

manner sought by AS 11.71.060(a)(1).  If this evidence exists it

does not appear in this record - the State presented no evidence,

or even argument on this point.  Accordingly, with no basis to

overrule or even qualify the <i>Ravin</i> decision, it must be applied.

The evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant is suppressed and

Count II of the Indictment is dismissed.<a href="#4">4</a>

     <a name="4">4</a>  This might well have been a case in which the &quot;good faith&quot;
exception to the warrant requirement would have saved Count I of

Everyone - the officer and the magistrate - seems to have followed
the &quot;rules&quot; as they appeared to them to be.

Subject: Draft of treaty proposal

 Greetings! This document is to be presented and read at the June 24 HR 
'95 program and later pursued in whatever forum is most expeditious.  
There are several key differences between what Mikki visualized and what 
I wrote, let alone what you think.  For example, Mikki thinks we should 
label the drug war a failure, and I think we should proclaim a 
conclusive victory.  We both think it should be shorter, but she wants 
to add more details on past and ongoing human rights abuses for 
emotional impact, along with excerpts from the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, Bill of Rights, etc., and I think it should be more 
general. We're now ready for your input. 

HR '95: Drug War Peace Treaty (First Draft May 12, 1995)

 Preamble:  We, the people, did not choose the rhetoric of warfare as an 
element of drug policy.  We did not declare war on our government, nor 
do we physically attack its institutions.  We do not wish to become 
combatants or casualties in the ever-escalating police actions of our 
own government.  Yet, for decades, ordinary citizens have been subject 
to the unprovoked violence and suffered cruel and unusual punishments in 
this politically motivated and one-sided Drug War.  Having borne more 
injustice than our patriotic forebears ever would have endured, we now 
call for a truce in the drug war to engage our government in negotiating 
a peace treaty, as follows: 

 Whereas the determination whether or not to consume any substance or
medication is a very personal decision reflecting free choice and 
individual preferences of lifestyle and social pastime; 

 Whereas the legitimate power of any just government is derived from a 
mutual respect of the government's laws by its people, and of the 
people's rights by their government; and

 Whereas the existing bureaucracy has made no effort to resolve this 
matter in a humane and negotiated manner, but has unilaterally pursued a 
military/police option with little discussion and no regard for its harm 
to families, individuals and human rights; 

 Therefore, on behalf of the American people, we declare this Drug War 
is ended.  We agree to eliminate the black market in drugs and the 
government agrees to abide by the following terms of agreement: 

 Article 1:  As a token of good faith, there shall be an immediate truce 
and release of all non-violent and otherwise (aside from drug charges) 
law abiding citizens held as Drug War prisoners by either side.  All 
pending non-violent drug charges shall be dropped. 

 Article 2:  The sovereignty of both citizen and state being the basis of
domestic law, the United States shall withdraw from and repudiate the 
Single Convention Treaty on Narcotic Drugs and any other international 
agreement or treaty which limits its ability to settle our domestic drug 
dispute. 

 Article 3:  Medicinal use of any substance is the private decision of 
the patient with the guidance of a health care provider and should be as 
free as possible from government interference.  No patient shall be 
prosecuted nor any physician penalized for use of mutually agreeable 
medications. 

 Article 4:  Cultural distinctions being a natural and inherently 
enriching aspect of civilization, choice of intoxicants or mood altering 
drugs is a human right, as long as they are consumed in a safe and 
responsible manner.  Traditional drug crops shall be allowed in all 
communities and areas where they have been historically produced and 
used. 

 Article 5:  Consistency and fairness being the foundations of justice, 
persons involved with drugs retain all their inalienable, human and 
constitutional rights without exception.  Government agents who engage 
in illegal activities and entrapment or provoke the breaking of laws 
shall be held fully accountable and prosecuted to the full extent of the 
law. 

 Article 6:  The role of law enforcement being to protect the rights,
freedoms, properties and personal safety of the people, no consensual 
drug activity undertaken by two or more adults shall be considered a 
crime unless a charge of damages is filed by an affected private party.  
Personal use of drugs is a private matter and exempt from government 
oversight. 

 Article 7:  Protection of public safety being a valid concern of 
government, being under the influence of a substance shall not be a 
valid legal defense, and every individual shall be held fully 
responsible for their own actions.  Performance and coordination tests, 
not forensics, shall be applied to determine impairment in the 
investigation of reckless or negligent operation of a motor vehicle. 

 Article 8:  The private sector being the most capable and effective 
response mechanism to supply and demand, government involvement in the 
manufacture and distribution of drugs shall be regulatory rather than 
direct.  Such regulation may be held analogous to the wine model.  
Commerce in drugs shall be subject to the same legal and ethical 
standards as any other business. 

 Article 9.  The elimination of the black market in illegal drugs being 
a primary purpose of this agreement, persons already engaging in the 
marketing of illicit drugs shall be given the opportunity to legitimize 
their operations without penalties for prior illegal activities.  
Testimony of satisfied customers shall be presented in support of such 
application. 

 Article 10:  The health and welfare of the people being a rightful 
concern of government, the following harm reduction measures shall be 
implemented: 

 1.  Age of consent for social drug use shall be determined by the local
community.  Care shall be taken to preserve the family unit.  Policies 
shall be designed to protect family properties and to avoid disruption 
and separation of the parent/child relationship.  Collection of a body 
of unbiased medical research shall be encouraged. 

 2.  Children shall be discouraged from drug use.  Education shall be 
accurate based on personal safety measures, the relative risks involving 
such substances, and the importance of waiting until adulthood.  It 
shall stress positive behavior patterns and promote abstinence, 
tolerance and personal responsibility. 

 3.  Cannabis shall be separated from other drugs through a lower age 
limit of 18 years and by permitting open concessions of soft drugs, 
including cannabis seeds, plants, clones, cured flowers and resins that 
are free of contaminants.  Package labeling shall accurately describe 
its contents and weight, include a potency rating, and list all 
additives. 

 4.  Policies shall favor substances in their natural raw form and 
discourage use of hard drugs.  Drug crops may be legally and 
commercially cultivated and distributed with a permit from the proper 
oversight agencies in agriculture and public health.  Package labeling 
shall accurately describe all contents, potency, dosage recommendations 
and list all additives. 

 5.  Chemical compounds derived from such plants shall be regulated with
synthetic pharmaceuticals and kept available at a pharmacy level.  
Restrictions on access shall be based on an impartial and uniform 
standard of health risk assessments and addictive potential.  Package 
labeling shall accurately describe its chemical content, recommended 
dosage, health warnings, and symptoms of overuse.  Accurate information 
shall be included on responsible use, and the physical and mental 
effects of the compounds taken alone or in combination with other drugs. 

 6.  Private shamanistic, religious, spiritual or other psychological 
training shall be recommended before anyone's first use of 
hallucinogens.  Persons exhibiting addictive or abusive behavior shall 
be encouraged to undergo humane treatment. 

 7.  Clean syringes and non-judgmental health care information shall be 
made available to intravenous drug users to prevent the spread of 
infections via shared needles.  To prevent addicts from engaging in 
property crimes, physically addictive drugs shall be made available 
through the public health care system at an affordable cost.  To clean 
up the streets, communities shall provide a sanitary indoor environment 
and discreet health care supervision for intravenous drug users. 

 Article 11:  The national debt being a pressing problem, all foreign 
aid for anti-drug programs shall be terminated immediately.  This 
includes the transfer or export of herbicides and equipment intended 
for drug surveillance and eradication operations. 

 Article 12:  Violent crime being a serious problem, narcotics police
agencies, personnel and resources shall return to normal law enforcement
investigations and prosecutions of violent and property crimes to 
protect the public. 

 Article 13:  Police resources being scarce, specialized forces and
surveillance equipment shall be used to combat terrorists, toxic 
polluters, criminal fraud, and illegal arms traffickers. 

 Article 14:  Bribery being a form of corruption, testimony given in 
exchange for money payments, reduced penalties, or commission on 
forfeited goods or assets shall not be used in a court of law. 

 Article 15:  Property rights being central to our social order, no 
property or assets may be taken by the government without due process 
and just compensation.  A jury shall be required to determine the 
validity of any such government claims and seizures. 

  Article 16:  Urine testing being an inaccurate, invasive and costly 
process and an affront to human dignity, it shall not be required for 
employment, insurance, parole, probation, or access to government 
benefits or programs.  This ban shall apply to all other chemical tests 
for inert compounds. 

 Article 17:  Commercial farming and production of non-drug industrial
cannabis sativa, L. or true hemp products shall be resumed and 
encouraged in proportion to its value as a commodity and shall not be 
subject to any drug enforcement oversight.

<p>Dear Carl,</p>

<p>I'm writing you to tell you about being arrested in Appanoose
County Iowa near Centerville.</p>

<p>On February 19th 1993 I was arrested on a county road near my
home by Appanoose County Sheriff's deputies, Centerville Police
Department and Iowa Division of Narcotics agents for
&quot;Prohibited Acts&quot;.</p>

<p>I was operating my father's 1985 Ford Escort station wagon in
a legal manner when I was stopped and arrested. Police Officer
Mike Seay informed me he and Chief Deputy Gary D. Anderson had
obtained 3 search warrants. One warrant for my residence, one
warrant for my parents' residence and one warrant for a farmhouse
that my father owns.</p>

<p>I was searched and sent to jail. I remained in jail until May
3rd 1993. It came to be known that officers Anderson and Seay had
committed perjury on the search warrant application.</p>

<p>It also came to be known that Jerry Nelson, Michael C. Seay,
Gary D. Anderson, and their informant Jeff Shondel, had engaged
in a plan to &quot;frame me&quot;.</p>

<p>Jeff Shondel, an alleged informant was said by Anderson and
Seay to have &quot;set-up&quot; a situation in which Jeff Shondel
would sell 3 kilograms of cocaine to an individual named Vincent
Portela, who Shondel claims to have met at my father's farmhouse
at rural Plano Iowa on February 12th 1993.</p>

<p>Quoting from the affidavit to obtain a search warrant, Shondel
allegedly stated the following: Vincent Portela offered to
purchase cocaine from Jeff Shondel for $60,000. Shondel described
Vincent Portela as having a medium build, slender, and &quot;with
a large scar from his ear to his chin and a deformed upper
jaw.&quot; Officer Seay alleges he showed a picture of Vincent
Portela to Shondel and Shondel said that was the person he met
with on February 12th 1993.</p>

<p>On February 19th 1993, three search warrants were issued in
reliance on Mr. Seay's and Anderson's allegations that Shondel
had arranged a &quot;controlled delivery&quot;.</p>

<p>Seay and Anderson also alleged that Shondel had
&quot;smoked&quot; marijuana with Chris Padavich on February 16th
1993 at my father's farmhouse in rural Plano Iowa.</p>

<p>On February 19th 1993 at 6:15 p.m. Officer Seay and Anderson
went to the farmhouse owned by my father and executed a search
warrant and allege to have found 4 1/2 pounds of marijuana.</p>

<p>On March 21st 1993 Officer Anderson aquired an ex-parte order
from Wallace Carter, Appanoose County Magistrate, to seize one
1987 Lincoln Towncar, one 1982 Lincoln Towncar, and 34 cows that
were located on the farm.</p>

<p>April 2nd 1993 the above property was sold at public auction.</p>

<p>The Iowa Department of Revenue assessed a penalty of $20,360
against me for 2019 grams of marijuana.</p>

<p>The was done to collect the Drug Tax Stamp that Iowa law
allows.</p>

<p>The Drug Tax Stamp is collected on &quot;allegations&quot; in
the state of Iowa.</p>

<p>If a person is accused, then the Department of Revenue can
collect the tax. The amount of tax is computed by taking 2019
grams of marijuana multiplied by $5 a gram. The law then calls
for &quot;double penalties&quot; which makes it $10 a gram.</p>

<p>On May 21st 1993 in Appanoose County District Court I filed a
motion to suppress the 4 1/2 pounds of marijuana.</p>

<p>The District Court Judge James P. Reilly heard the motion to
suppress.</p>

<p>Michael C. Seay, Gary D. Anderson, Jerry Nelson of the Iowa
Division of Narcotics Enforcement, and Jeff Shondel, testified at
the hearing for the state.</p>

<p>On direct examination by my attorney, Jeff Shondel testified
that &quot;he did not know Vincent Portela&quot;. Shondel also
testified that he did not remember describing Portela as having a
scar from his ear to his chin and a deformed jaw.</p>

<p>Shondel testified that Jerry Nelson on February 19th 1993 had
given Shondel $10,000 and provided Shondel with 61 pounds 6
ounces of cocaine.</p>

<p>Jerry Nelson testified that there was no sale of cocaine on
February 19th 1993.</p>

<p>Officer Seay testified that in fact Vincent Portela was in
prison in New York and could not have been at the residence as
Shondel and Seay had said.</p>

<p>Mr. Seay claims he did not lie or know Shondel was lying when
he had prepared the affidavit.</p>

<p>Mr. Seay claims that Shondel met &quot;a look alike&quot; to
Vincent Portela, another individual that has a scar from his ear
to his chin and a deformed upper jaw.</p>

<p>To date Mr. Seay has not produced anyone who looks like
Vincent Portela.</p>

<p>The search warrant relied on in this case was an
&quot;anticipatory&quot; search warrant.</p>

<p>The warrant was issued on Mr. Seay's and Shondel's
representations that Shondel would sell 3 kilograms of cocaine on
2/19/93. There was no one at the house when Shondel arrived
there, no sale, no money, no Portela.</p>

<p>The judge, James P. Reilly, ruled that a controlled set-up is
legal even if the drugs are not delivered to the property if
Shondel said he had smoked marijuana there.</p>

<p>The testimony at the motion hearing clearly establish that the
&quot;controlled set-up&quot; was &quot;a mere pretext to an
unjustifiable search.&quot;</p>

<p>The fact that I was arrested on the roadside for
&quot;Prohibited Acts&quot; demonstrates that the controlled
delivery that did not occur was the basis for the search
warrants.</p>

<p>The reason being, that I was not arrested for &quot;smoking
pot&quot;, but for cocaine that the law enforcement agents had
provided to a convicted felon named Jeff Shondel.</p>

<p>At the time of my arrest, Officer Seay advised me that he was
going to search. Therefore, the police were not aware of the
contents of the residences.</p>

<p>On December 3rd 1993 I was found guilty of possession of
marijuana with intent to deliver and Iowa Drug Tax Stamp.</p>

<p>On January 14th 1994 I was sentenced to two 5 year sentences
to run consecutively and fined $5,000 on each count plus 30%
surcharge.</p>

<p>I was sent to prison until January 22nd 1994 when my father
posted $20,000 appeal bond.</p>

<p>The case is now on appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court.</p>

<p>On May 15th 1995 a hearing was held at the capitol in front of
5 justices of the Iowa Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In the hearing, the Iowa Assitant Attorney General, Bridget
Chambers, agreed that Shondel had lied and the Mr. Seay and
Anderson had known that Shondel was lying.</p>

<p>Justice Louis Lavaroto said, &quot;Does the state agree that
Shondel's credibility was totally shattered at the motion
hearing?&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Chambers' response, &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>

<p>It is now apparent that there was perjury and that the police
engaged in a scheme to &quot;frame me&quot;.</p>

<p>I'm currently awaiting a decision in the case. The issue
remaining is whether the police can obtain 3 search warrants for
3 properties on a known liar's allegation that he had smoked
marijuana at one of the residences.</p>

<p>The Iowa Supreme Court on April 26th 1995 in State v.
Gillespie, an appeal from Polk County of a cocaine distribution
case, ruled that Iowa Code chapter 808 does not allow
&quot;anticipatory warrants&quot;.</p>

<p>That is the reason the state claims that &quot;smoking
marijuana&quot; is sufficient to uphold the 3 warrants.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Shondel when asked could not even
describe the interior of the residence he claims to have been in
on the dates Shondel claims to have been there.</p>

<p>Mr. Seay and Anderson in the affidavit for search warrant
claim that they had &quot;confirmed&quot; Shondel's allegations.</p>

<p>At the suppression hearing, Mr. Seay claims that he was at the
Law Center in Centerville, 11 miles away, and that neither he nor
any other officer observed any activity at any of the three
residences.</p>

<p>It was also discoverd that Jeff Shondel was a convicted felon.
He was a convicted thief. Also Shondel was facing 20 years in
federal prison for possession the cocaine that law enforcement
used to &quot;set-up&quot; the search.</p>

<p>In the attachments to the search warrants, Mr. Seay claimed
that &quot;Shondel had no motivation to falsify
information&quot;. At the motion hearing, Seay claimed he did not
know Shondel was a felon or that Shondel was facing prison time.
It's obvious that the police here are corrupt.</p>

<p>Obviously, Judge James Reilly condones illegal acts by the
police.</p>

<p>I feel Ihave a duty to reveal these criminals to the public.</p>

<p>If the Iowa Supreme Court upholds the search warrants, I plan
to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court the search and the Iowa Drug
Tax Stamp.</p>

<p>If anyone has any input about my letter, please have them
write to me. My address is Chris Padavich, P.O. Box 79, Plano,
Iowa 52581.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Christopher Padavich</p>

<pre>Dear Carl,
     I am sending these pictures as a reminder of the long sentences
that the feds are giving for nonviolent marijuana &quot;Crimes&quot;.  How many
of these people received such long sentences are absurd stories, but
even if they were all caught with large amounts of marijuana their
sentences are still outrageous considering the average length of time
someone does for murder is about eight years.  It is bad enough that
we are in prison, but it 4s even worse and enough to break someone's
heart when we are put in here with men that death will be their only
release from here.  Many of these people have exhausted their appeals
and the only thing that gets them through another day is the hope
that legalization activists give them.

Sincerely,
Paul Westmoreland

<pre>Dear Carl,
     I want to thank you for the help that you gave us with getting
the marijuana plant weight change in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.
The change will get a total of 45 years cut off of the sentences of
some of the people in these pictures and with some changes in the 
Mandatory Minimum sentencing laws the plant weight change will help get 
even more time cut from some of these people's sentences.
     I also want to encourage all marijuana POWs to become active,
even if it is just writing one letter a month to somebody.  That
one letter helps!  I also want to tell all federal POWs not to waste
their time in prison by spending some time in the law library researching
their case.  Of course a lawyer is going to try to make you think that
he/she did as good of a job as they could, but if you will research
your case you might find out that they didn't.  Don't think that 
everything the U.S. Attorney said is the truth, if you check you might 
find out they lied about many things.  I started of with a 151 month 
sentence three years ago, after finding out the U.S. Attorney lied about 
my criminal history (I told my lawyer I thought they had one charge 
wrong, but even my lawyer lied to me and said he checked that charge and
U.S. Attorney had it right) I will be able to get my sentence reduced
to 63 months.  In 1993 the U.S. Sentencing Commission changed the way
that it weighed LSD and I thought that the amount of weight charged
for marijuana plants was just as absurd as the way they had been weighing
LSD, so I started writing people asking them to get the marijuana plant
weight changed.  It took two years to get the change, but now I might
be going home as soon as November of this year.  I am not saying
that everybody will get the same results, but you never know until
you try!</pre>

<pre>Sincerely,
Paul Westmoreland

<pre>STATEMENT OF INTRODUCTION</pre>
</center></div>

<pre>     The Defendent / Appellant, Rev. Tom Brown Pro Per, seeks to introduce 
this appeal by casting the eye of the Court on some issues that should be 
kept in mind as the Court considers the case at hand.  This case is only 
one in a long series of battles of the vaunted War on Drugs.  As in any 
war, looking back over the past thirty years, we can see lots of 
casualties.  The question is, how many more bodies will be heaped on the 
Alter of National Paranoia ?  A wise man once said that those who refuse 
to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it.  Perhaps the Court could 
look at another war we waged on ourselves, another war bred in ignorance 
and fed on lies and corruption.
     In Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. at page 700, Justice Taney 
announces the decision of the Court saying:

        &quot;The question before us, is whether the class of persons
   described in the plea of abatement compose a portion of this
   people and are constituent members of this sovereignty.  We
   think they are not, and that they are not included under the
   word citizen in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none
   of the rights and priveleges which that instrument provides
   for and secures to citizens of the United States.  On the con-
   trary, they were at that time considered as a subordinate and
   inferior class of beings, who had been subjugated by the dom-
   inant race, and whether emancipated or not, yet remained sub-
   ject to their authority, and had no rights or priveleges but
   such as those who held power and the government might grant
   them.
        It is not the providence of the Court to decide upon the
   justice or injustice, the policy or the impolicy of these laws.
   The decision of that question belonged to the political or
   law making power; to those who formed the sovereignty and
   framed the Constitution.
        The language of the Declaration of independence is equa-
   lly conclusive.  It proceeds to say; 'We hold these truths to
   be self evident; that all men are created equal; that they are
   endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
   among them is life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness;
   that to secure these rights, governments are instituted, deri-
   ving their just powers from the consent of the governed.'...
        The general words above quoted would seem to embrace the
   whole human family, and if they were used in a similar instru-
   ment at this day, would so be understood.  But it is too clear
   for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended
   to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed
   and adopted this declaration; . . .&quot;

     The Court will see these words again in the decisions which have 
refused to recognize the religous use of plants.  Not all courts have 
refused to recognize over 5,000 years of recorded human history, but the 
words of those who have are redolent with the scent of the Dred Scott 
decision, and the bodies of those who perished in the attempt to make up 
for the cowardice of the Dred Scott court.  Time after time those courts 
strain to justify the denial of rights which no man can claim did not 
exist and were not exercised among the peoples who wrote the Declaration 
and the Constitution.  And as Justice McLean's dissent shows below, 
despicable and vile acts perpetrated by men who happen to occupy positions 
of power are not unprecedented.  There was no Truth to the assertion that 
&quot;no one thought of disputing&quot; the issue of slavery at the time of the 
revolution.  There was no Truth to the statement that &quot;they formed no part 
of the people who framed and adopted this Declaration.&quot;  In fact:

        &quot;Crispus Attucks, a Negro, was the first man killed by
   the British in the Boston Massacre.  The five thousand Negro
   soldiers who fought in the revolution . . .  Three quarters of
   the Rhode Island Regiment passing in review at Yorktown in
   1781 were Negroes. (Afro-American Encyclopedia, 1974)

But this truth was known in 1856 as we see in Justice McLean's dissent:

        &quot;In the Convention, it was proposed by a committee of
   eleven to limit the importation of slaves to the year 1800,
   when Mr. Pickney moved to extend the time to the year 1808.
   This motion carried . . .  In Opposition to the motion, Mr.
   Madison said; 'Twenty years will produce all the mischief
   that can be apprehended from the liberty to import slaves;
   so long a term will be more dishonerable to the American
   character than to say nothing about it in the Constitution'
   Madison Papers.
        But we know as a historical fact that James Madison, that
   great and good man, a leading member in the Federal Convention,
   was solicitous to guard the language of that instrument so as
   not to convey the idea there could be property in Man.&quot;

     So the lies and deceit of the Taney majority went on to result in a 
war of unprecedented proportion on this soil.  More died in it than in 
WWI, WWII, Korea, and Vietnam combined.  And we paid a hard price for that 
clever though despicable interpretation of History and precedent.  The 
question is posed here, what price will this Court chose to be paid.  The 
Rev. Brown comes to this Court as a Man of Honor, with empty hands and 
outstretched arms.  Rev. Brown comes before this Court as the result of an 
act of conscience, inspired by the Holy Spirit of God.  The Court is 
refered to the words of James Michner, in his book Covenent.  As we 
listen, a young African is asking an old adviser as to the choice of 
weapons he should carry;

        &quot;How do I protect myself ?&quot;
        &quot;Integrity is a good shield.  He paused.  Did I ever come
   armed to your fathers krall ?  Couldn't he have killed me in a
   moment if he wished?  Why didn't he?  Because he knew that if he
   killed a Man of Honor, he'd soon have on his hands, men with
   none.  And then the whole thing falls apart. (pg. 91)

     Later in the book, another character is remembering her brother who 
became a spy and sold the secrets of the government.

        &quot;When she tried to decipher how he had been seduced into
   committing his mortal sin - the betrayal of his nation and his
   peers - she began to think of the role words play in life.  Our
   family was keen on word games.  Wexton and I played them const-
   antly.  I think I first came to suspect him when he cheated one
   day.  Altered the meaning of a word in order to win.  At Cambridge
   he altered the meanings of great words and ended a traitor.
   Back in Salisbury, walking within the shadow of the Cathedral,
   she thought: Integrity in words protects integrity in life.
   If a word is corrupted, everything that stems from it will be
   evil.&quot;

     And so it is that we have evil in our own time, and in our own place. 
A creeping, seductive evil that knows every nook and cranny of the 
administrative, legislative and judicial branch of government.  And it is 
born in a series of little lies, lies told, lies repeated, and lies which 
become the bricks of the foundation of our life.  And the question is, 
will this Court end the lies.
     There are already over ten million marijuana felons in our nation.  
We outnumber all the judges, prosecutors, police, drug bureaucrats, and 
military by about two to one.  How much longer will thirty perceent of our 
population be treated as a &quot;subordinate and inferior class of beings . . . 
(who) had no rights or priveleges but such as those who held power and the 
government might grant them.&quot;  How much longer will we be expected to 
suffer in peace while the abuses of our rights continue unabated?  How 
much longer will the courts decide questions of the burdening of religous 
establishment and exercise one way for the Roman Catholic Church, and 
another for Our Church ?  Is it too soon to address the question, is the 
issue not ripe enough ?  You can dam the river, but you can't stop the 
rain.  Please, for God's sake and our own, stop the lies and live in the 
truth !

<title>A Common Sense Judge - September 5, 1995</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#0000FF"

<h1 align="center">A common-sense judge</h1>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Inflexible sentencing</b>
guidelines<br>
add to federal prison crowding</font></p>

<p>The Justice Department reports that the number of men and
women behind bars increased by 83,294 last year, the
second-biggest yearly increase in history, bringing the number of
state and federal prisoners to just over 1 million - a new
record. Counting the number of people on probation or parole,
more than 5 million Americans are under some form of court
supervision.</p>

<p>That figure has tripled since 1980.</p>

<p>If American prisons were stockholder-owned companies, they
would be the darlings of Wall Street. Unfortunately, taxpayers
are footing the bill, and they are getting precious little for
their investment. While overall crime rates may be declining,
Americans do not feel safer and violent offenders seem
increasingly beastly.</p>

<p>The role of prisons must get more thoughtful consideration.
Certainly, violent criminals must be confined, but the cold
reality is the nation can't afford to continue putting so many
people behind bars. The problem is particularly acute in the
federal system, where new sentencing rules have increased the
median prison time by 60 percent between 1986 and 1992. And,
thanks to the &quot;war on drugs, 60 percent of federal prisoners
in 1993 were convicted of drtig-related crimes - up from 25
percent a decade earlier.</p>

<p>The combination of aggressive federal drug prosecutions and
new sentencing rules is causing federal prisons to fill up with
offenders serving sentences of 30 years or more for relatively
minor drug offenses. And the situation has some federal judges
near revolt.</p>

<p>Senior Circuit Judge Myron H. Bright of Fargo, N.D., is one.
Bright, a federal judge for nearly three decades, sits on the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, which includes Iowa.
He's had it with the federal sentencing system.</p>

<p>In a recent case involving two Iowa men sentenced to roughly
29 years each in a drug-sales conspiracy, Bright filed a separate
opinion declaring war on the federal sentencing rules, which
factor in such things as prior records, the use of weapons, the
amount of drugs seized, etc., to produce a sentence by a
mathematical formula created by a federal sentencing commission.</p>

<p>Neither Larry Edward Hiveley, 48, nor Ansil Ezra Henry, 44,
had serious prior records; indeed, they were deemed worthy of
release on their word they would show up for trial. But, based on
the amount of drugs seized and the presence of weapons in
Hiveley's home, the sentencing formula dictated a 21-year
sentence for Hively and 19 1/2 years for Henry. Bright concedes
they deserve prison, but &quot;I doubt that any reasonable judge
would have sentenced these offenders to more than 10 years'
incarceration, and most probably to less, given their limited
criminal history.&quot;</p>

<p>By the time these two former Iowa farm boys are released,
Bright noted, they will be candidates for the geriatric ward, and
taxpayers will have spent close to a half-million dollars to
imprison them for a decade longer than necessary. &quot;But that
is only an infinitesimal portion of the financial burden imposed
by excessive sentences&quot; in the federal system, Bright said.
He calculates that the unnecessary imprisonment of minor drug
offenders costs tax payers nearly $359 million a year, adding up
to billions over time.</p>

<p>And it's not just the wasted resources, but wasted lives, too.
&quot;As an appellate judge, I have seen Draconian sentences
meted out in drug cases where an offender has had no contact with
any drugs but may only be a minor functionary in a drug
conspiracy where heavy amounts of drugs could be involved.&quot;
He cited a case where the offender merely &quot;provided
glassware usable to manufacture amphetamines&quot;and was
sentenced to serve 30 years.</p>

<p>&quot;These unwise sentencing policies which put men and women
in prison for years not only ruin lives of prisoners and often
their family members, but also drain the American taxpayers of
funds which can be measured in billions of dollars,&quot; Bright
wrote. &quot;In these times, the government, Congress and the
president see the need to make drastic cuts in the federal
budget.... This is the time to call a halt to the unnecessary and
expensive cost of putting people in prison for a long time based
on the mistaken notion that such an effort will win 'The War on
Drugs.' If it is a war, society seems not to be winning, but
losing.&quot;</p>

<p>Bright cited a survey showing that 86 percent of federal
judges want the sentencing rules changed. And he said he intends
to append his protest statement to every drug case where he
believes it applies. &quot;The public needs to know that
unnecessary, harsh and unreasonable drug sentences serve to waste
billions of dollars without doing much good for society. We have
an unreasonable system.&quot;</p>

<p>May his words be heard.</p>

DRUG POSSESSION CHARGE 
 
Urbandale officer arrested in D.M. 
 
'Scores' of sex-oriented items are also found in the van driven 
by police veteran James Trimble. 
 
By MICHAEL McNARNEY 
Register Staff Writer 
 
     James R. Trimble, Urbandale police officer and school 
liaison officer for the Urbandale district, was arrested early 
Monday for allegedly possessing methamphetamine with the intent 
to deliver. 
     Also found were "scores" of sex-oriented pictures and 
letters.  No charges relating to those had been filed by Monday 
night. 
     Trimble, an 18-year Urbandale police veteran, will likely be 
suspended until the investigation is completed, Urbandale Police 
Chief David Hamlin said. 
     Trimble, 43 was pulled over by Des Moines police about 4 
a.m. in the 600 block of Clark Street.  In a police report, 
Officer Steven Kees said, "There was a substantial amount of what 
appeared to be meth in the van. 
     Besides Trimble, of 501 Second St., West Des Moines, a woman 
with him in the van was also aressted: Lorrie K. Breiholz, 34, of 
433 S.E. Phillip St., No. 106, in Des Moines.  Both were charged 
with possession of narcotics with the intent to deliver them. 
 
Wife Is Arrested, Too 
     Trimble's wife was arrested six hours after he was when 
police raided their home.  Robin Lynn Trimble, 41, was charged 
with possession of narcotics.  A police report of the search 
alleged she was in possession of marijuana. 
     Trimble's mother, Beverly, let police search her home at 
7213 Palm Drive in Urbandale.  They found nothing.  Police said 
the van Trimble was driving, which belongs to his mother, was 
circling a neighborhood north of downtown when Breiholz was seen 
by police not wearing a seat belt.  They said when Trimble pulled 
over, he made movements toward the center of the van "as if he 
was trying to hide or reach for something." 
     Trimble got out of the van and walked toward officers, and 
he did not get back in the van as ordered.  The police report 
said he was "extremely nervous." 
     While Trimble was detained in a police car, he told Kees 
that he was an Urbandale police officer.  Officers found a 
substance in the van, and a field test indicated that it was 
methamphetamine.  Des Moines police also called Hamlin, 
Urbandale's chief, to tell him what happened. 
     In a telephone interview Monday night, Hamlin said he was 
shocked when he got the news. 
     "He had a good work record, a good reputation with the 
department," Hamlin said.  "I found it rather stunning to hear 
about it." 
     Hamlin said he had not consulted with the city attorney, but 
he said he intends to suspend Trimble pending further 
investigation.  "At that time, I'll determine his long-term 
status," he said. 
     Hamlin said Trimble had been the school liaison officer for 
five years. 
     "I had no idea," Superintendent Tom Davis said of the news 
Monday.  He referred questions to school attorney Jeff Krausman. 
     Krausman said officials could not comment because Trimble is 
employed jointly by the school district and the city. 
     Trimble was active in D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education), an anti-drug education program.  "We don't just teach 
kids what drugs look like," Trimble said in a 1992 interview.  
"We teach life skills needed to say no to drugs, alcohol and 
tobacco. 
     Trimble was being held at the Des Moines City Jail Monday 
night.  Bond was set at $19,500.</pre></body></html>

'I feel we have to be more careful of who we put in charge of 
your kids.' 
-- Brad Van Horn, parent 
 
Shock, anger follow arrest of policman 
 
Urbadale youths looked up to James Trimble, who encouraged them 
to lead responsible, drug-free lives. 
 
By STEPHANIE ARMOUR 
Register Staff Writer 
 
     Urbandale, Ia. -- For years. Angie Van Horn believed her 
basketball coach was dedicated to keeping kids off drugs. 
     Now the 15-year-old doesn't know what to believe. 
     Early Tnesday morning, her parents told her that James R. 
Trimble -- an Urbandale police officer and long-time coach -- had 
been arrested.  The liaison officer with the Urbandale school 
district is charged with trafficking in marijuana and 
methamphetamine. 
     Police also say Trimble -- found with a sexual device 
insented in his body -- was driving around with scores of sex-
oriented videotapes and pictures, including photos of himself.  A 
Des Moines woman was arrested with him. 
     "I looked up to him as a teachcr," Angie said of Trimble, 
who had been the ninth-grade girls' basketball coach.  "He would 
tell us not to do drugs and what they can do to you,  I'm kind of 
angry, because he was teaching me not to do that kind of stuff." 
     Angie's not alone.  Parents, students and co-workers who 
know Trimble expressed anger and shock at news of the arrest. 
     Trimble. an 18-year veteran of the Urbandale force, coached 
ninth-grade girls' basketball and volleyball.  He also was an 
officer with the district's Drug Abuse Resistance Education 
(D.A.R.E.) program. 
 
"A Hollow Spot" 
     Family members also said they were stunned. 
     "I just have a big hollow spot," said his mother, Beverly 
Trimble.  "I'm too upset.  Until I have a chance to talk to my 
son, I have no comment.  If you would let this subject drop, it 
would give the family some peace." 
     Starting today, the Urbandale district will launch a "crisis 
plan" -- holding group meetings and visits with counselors to 
discuss Trimble's arrest. 
     In light of some of the sexual material found with Trimble, 
administrators said they will probably talk with students to see 
if anyone felt uncomfortable with, or was threatened by, the 
officer. 
     Trimble has been suspended by the police department and the 
school district. 
     As a D.A.R.E. officer, he was one of several police members 
who would talk to young people about staying off drugs.  The 17-
week program is aimed at fifth-graders. 
     He was described as a somewhat tempermental basketball coach 
who would cheer at football games and sit in on drug-abuse 
panels.  His daughter is a student in the Urbandale school 
district. 
 
"People Are In Shock" 
     "A lot of people are in shock," said Urbandale Police Chief 
David Hamlin.  "He had a good background and devoted the last 
five years to working with young people.  It makes it more 
difficult to understand." 
     But some parents said they don't understand why Trimble was 
working with kids in the first place. 
     "We're very surprised and upset at the school system," said 
Brad Van Horn, Angie's father.  "I feel we have to be more 
careful of who we put in charge of your kids.  It stands to 
reason you can trust a police officer." 
     Some said they were troubled by the sexual smorgasbord 
discovered with Trimble. 
     He had "all kinds of sexually explicit" material, said Des 
Moines police Sgt. Bill Judkins.  Police said Trimble had a 
sexual device connected to a battery pack inserted in his body. 
     School officials described Trimble as "very actcve" in 
student activities, although not at the elementaty level. 
     "We are shocked and saddened by this," said Len Cockman, an 
Urbandale school spokesman. 
     But some said there should be few surprises when it comes to 
methamphetamine. 
     "Quite frankly, I can tell you we've been involved in 
investigating every race, every nationality, almost every 
occupatIon you can think of," said Des Moines police Lt. Russell 
Underwood.  "Now there's a police officer, which is devastating." 
 
SCHOOL ROLES 
 
Urbandale officer James Trimble was involved in: 
 
* Coaching ninth-grade girls' basketball and volleyball in the 
Urbandale school district. 
 
* Drug Abuse Resistance Education, or D.A.R.E., as a school 
liaison officer. 
 
* Quest, a program at Urbandale Middle School that aims to build 
character and values.</pre></body></html>

Trimble's wife accuses him of domestic abuse after dispute 
 
He is ordered to stay away from his spouse after allegedly 
threatening to kill her and himself in a dispute hours before his 
arrest. 
 
By TOM ALEX 
Register Staff Writer 
 
     An Urbandale police officer arrested on drug trafficking 
charges is also facing a charge of domestic abuse. 
     James R. Trimble threatened to kill his wife and then commit 
suicide early New Year's Day, according to a no-contact order 
issued Tuesday in Polk County District Court.  The order was 
issued after police said Trimble's wife turned up at the West Des 
Moines police station, saying she had been the victim of domestic 
abuse. 
     Under the order, Trimble must stay away from his wife, Robin 
Lynn, until Jan. 24. 
     The incident is said to have occured two hour's into 1996 
and about two hours before James Trimble was arrested by Des 
Moines police. 
     Trimble, 43, an 18-year veteran of the Urbandale department 
who has been active in the Drug Abuse Resistance Education 
program (D.A.R.E.), was arrested early Monday.  Police said they 
found a little over 7 ounces of methamphetamine -- $20,000 worth 
-- in the van he was driving. 
     He was charged with two counts of possession of narcotics 
with intent to deliver and with a tax stamp violation. 
     Authorities said he also had sexually explicit videotapes 
and pictures when Des Moines police pulled him over in the 600 
block of Clark Street.  He has been suspended from his work with 
the department and the school. 
     A Des Moines woman with Trimble also was arrested: Lorrie 
Breiholz, 34, of 433 Philip St. was charged with possession of 
narcotics with the intent to deliver.  Police said Trimble 
apparently picked her up at Seventh Street and College Avenue 
earlier in the morning. 
     Police said they did not show a prior arrest record for 
Breiholz and did not say how she came to be in the car. 
     Police raided the Trimble home at 50l Second St., West Des 
Moines, hours after the arrests.  Robin Lynn, Trimble's wife, was 
charged with possession of narcotics after a "dime size" amount 
of marijuana was found, police said.  She was later released. 
     According to the report filed by Trimble's wife, he 
allegedly grabbed her by the arms during an argument and left a 
bruise the size of a quarter on her upper right arm. 
     Meanwhile, Urbandale Police Chief David Hamlin said officers 
were checking to see whether any confiscated drugs held for court 
cases were missing from evidence lockers. 
     Hamlin said that Trimble, who until Monday headed the five-
officer drug prevention unit, has been entrusted in the past with 
the task of destroying illegal narcotics by burning them. 
     As with any pollee officer on the department, Trimble was 
hired only after an extensive background check, Hamlin said. 
     "Regardless of the procedures you set up, if an officer 
wants to be crooked there's a way to do it," Hamlin said. 
     At a news conferenee Tuesday, Des Moines police Sgt. William 
Judkins described the arrest as traumatic. 
     "I feel badly for the image of the police department," 
Judkins said. 
     No charges were filed in connection with the "large amount" 
of sexually oriented photographs and videos police said they 
found on Trimble.  Judkins, noting that Trimble has been a school 
liaison officer in Urbandale, made a point of saying none of the 
pictures or videos included anyone of school age. 
     Following an initial appearance Tuesday in Polk County 
District Court, Trimble was released from the Polk County Jail 
under the county's pretrial release program.  He is scheduled to 
appear in court on the two drug counts on Feb. 6.

<pre>Roderick T. Harvey 
Saline Co. Detention Ctr. 
Harrisburg, IL 62946 
 
Jan. 21, '96 
 
Dear Mr. Olsen, 
     Thank you again for your concern, guidance, and for always 
answering my letters so promptly.  I appreciate the fall News 
Letter (is there a new one?), and all the other pertinent 
literature you have sent me; it is very informative, interesting 
and enlightening.  I am heeding your advice and trying to focus 
my mind away from suicide by becoming actively involved in the 
reform movement. 
     After you posted my letter on the Internet last November, I 
received three letters right away and was very excited about it.  
Unfortunately, that was the end of it, except for one very 
faithful correspondent from San Mateo, CA, a Dr. Tom J. 
O'Connell.  And, of course, one very negative letter from David 
R. McSporen of Columbia, MO, -- just to keep things balanced.  I 
shouldn't complain, but damn, after almost six months of 
diligently trying, I have not been able to establish any kind of 
social correspondence network whatsoever.  I am &quot;starving&quot; for 
some personal, semi-intellectual, like-minded correspondence, and 
this kind of &quot;hunger strike&quot; I do not wish to be on.  I believe a 
lot of my despondency is born of a profound loneliness. 
     Excuse me, Carl, I digressed.  The reason I am writing to 
you concerns my jury trial which is scheduled very soon, Feb. 5, 
a week from this Monday, in Benton, IL, near Southern Illinois 
Univ. in Carbondale.  I have a favor to ask, but time is so short 
I don't know whether it is even within the realm of possibility. 
     You are probably quite aware of the reputation of Public 
Defenders (Pretenders), so I'll refrain from belittling mine any 
further.  However, it is do disconcerting to know that my case is 
very defensible, but only if I could afford a good attorney who 
would excert some genuine effort, and then, no doubt, I could be 
acquitted.  My P.D. initially excited me with a lot of talk of 
intentions of things he would do to prepare a competent defense.  
Unfortunately, he hasn't followed through at all.  During his 
most recent visit I was informing him of the falsehoods being 
presented by the DEA regarding the quantity, quality, and value 
of said 148 marijuana (their spelling) plants.  I, sadly, am not 
going to be able to testify because of those pending charges in 
Kentucky, but he said that if I could find a knowledgeable person 
to act as an expert witness, he has the capability to pay 
expenses for that person to come testify at my trial, including 
being flown in from out of state. 
     You are the first person I thought of with the connections, 
and I'm hoping you will put me in touch with someone.  (By the 
way, I have never had any response from the Fam. Council on D.A., 
do you suppose there could be a willing expert witness amongst 
their group?) 
     I'll give you a condensed version of the situation and the 
false claims to be refuted. 
 
Facts: 
 
     148 plants, immature, the male (hemp) just beginning to 
flower.  50% or more will be male, discarded, no value.  The 
remaining at this point have very minute THC%, very low potency 
level, even mature leaves have virtually no street value. 
 
     I had been hospitalized for 7 weeks after a truck ran into 
me on my 10 speed bike.  I checked myself out and went to the 
woods on crutches, and was apprehended within hours, but was 
never observed around any plots of marijuana.  The prosecution is 
suggesting I was going to harvest then, sell it for millions, or 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, and leave the country.  
Actually, there was 2 - 3 pounds of green leaf, worth maybe $50 
to $100 on the street, but nobody really wants it. 
     The DEA is trying to make this look like a big, high-profile 
drug manufacturing operation, because they invested so much time 
in surveillance (6 weeks), so much manpower and equipment (23 
field agents, 2 planes, cameras, radios, vehicles, overtime 
payrolls, etc.), and all they wound up with was one crippled 
camper and enough marijuana for the personal use of a small 
family, or a couple of average smoking adults. 
     In the indictment, I'm charged with 148 sinsemilla plants, -
- that is really stretching the truth.  The feds now calculate 
100 grams per plant, which makes this 33 lbs.  An experienced 
gardner, botonist, anyone knowledgeable (our expert witness) can 
show how preposterous that is to the jury.  After the males are 
culled, the 74 (half) remaining plants out in the forest are 
attacked by insects, animals and diseases, lack of water and 
insufficient sun, and bing inundated with a myriad of wild 
plants, vines and weeds leave only 30 - 40 harvestable plants. 
     The federal gov't. supplies for medicinal purposes 10 
cigarettes a day, that's a quarter ounce (7 grams).  50 pot 
plants (100 g. per plant) supplies a half ounce a day, for one 
seasonal year; enough medical doses for two people.  Evidently 
this marijuana was being grown for personal use; not enough to 
sell, much less a big drug operation. 
     We'll ask the judge to allow the jury to find me guilty on 
lesser charges.  If he'll do this, I believe justice will 
prevail. 
     Carl, I apologize for running this out so long, I meant to 
be much more concise and clear. 
     And now it's about five o'clock in the morning and I'm 
trying to finish this before the mail goes out in about an hour. 
     My attorney suggested a reputable person without any felony 
convictions, of course.  Otherwise, I really don't know what kind 
of qualifications an expert witness should have, except whatever 
would impress the jury and not easily be discredited by the 
prosecution.  (Professor?) 
     I can be contacted via this message number (S.C.D.C. 618-
252-8661 - jail) at the jail, altho' I would have to return the 
call collect.  My P.D.'s name and address: 
     Phillip J. Kavanaugh 
     750 Missouri Ave., Rm. 110 
     East St. Louis, IL 62202 
     Ph.# 618-482-9050 
     I would have asked you sooner if I'd have known.  I sure 
would appreciate any assistance you can give.  I do believe it 
will make a significant difference in the verdict and the 
sentencing range.  There is a possibility that my court date will 
be set back anywhere from one day to several weeks, that is a 
very common occurance around here.  So any recommendations or 
suggestions are welcome, and I also have more input disproving 
false gov't. claims.  Thank you. 
     Sincerely, 
     Roderick</pre>

<title>Who will protect children from legalized drugs?</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">

<p>The Des Moines Register, Wednesday, February 21, 1996, 9A</tt></center> <center><font
size="7"><strong>Essay/Comment</strong></font></center> <center><font
size="5"><em>Iowa View</em>/<strong>Karol Crosbie</strong></font></center></p>

<p> <font size="6">Who will protect children from legalized
drugs?</font></p>

<p> <img src="../images/afraid.gif"></p>

<p> <font size="4"><strong>What are</strong> the chances that we
can keep legal cocaine from fifth-graders?</font> </p>

<p> The date is 2001. The place is a fifth-grade health-science
class. The use of heroin, marijuana and cocaine is now legal for
adults. The teacher begins her lesson: </p>

<p> &quot;Today we will talk about what it feels like to be high
on cocaine. If you sniff or smoke, or shoot, your whole body
changes. Your heart beats faster. You feel hot - hotter than
you've ever felt with your worst fever. </p>

<p> &quot;But most important is how you feel inside your head.
Your mind seems to work better. You can give a speech better,
argue better, tell a joke better. Your thoughts come faster; you
can remember more things; your memories are sharper. You don't
feel discouraged like you usually do. You feel relaxed, and like
you're floating above everything. You feel powerful - and you
feel like talking about your power. You can do anything. You are
sure you are the best, the smartest, the fastest. </p>

<p> &quot;A lot of people can be high on cocaine without anyone
else knowing. But sometimes the brain's chemistry is so mixed up
that it plunges you into a kind of nightmare - called a cocaine
psychosis. You are terrified. You believe your friends are going
to hurt you. You hear voices. You feel things - roaches crawling
on your face. </p>

<p> &quot;A high will last about 30 minutes. When it is over you
will remember it. You can't forget it. It was wonderful. You want
it again. You are depressed until you have it again. It doesn't
matter that the inside of your nose has open sores from sniffing.
It doesn't matter that your best friend died from cocalne because
her heart beat too fast and then just quit. You want the
experience again. </p>

<p> &quot;So you've got to say 'no' to this drug. Believe me.
Just say 'no.'&quot;</p>

<p> <img src="../images/madness.gif"> </p>

<p> What are the chances that our imaginary students will say no?
At this point we can replace fiction with facts. The facts are
that kids are much more likely to say &quot;yes&quot; to legal
drugs and &quot;no&quot; to illegal drugs. Our current legal drug
- alcohol - will cause the intoxication of close to 40 percent of
high-school seniors as often as every two weeks. Illegal drugs
are used by 25 percent of seniors. </p>

<p> Despite problems with prohibition, the fact is that when
alcohol was against the law, usage declined to a third or fourth
of its former level. And it is no coincidence that incidence of
cirrhosis of the liver fell by half. Laws and sanctions do have
an effect on human behavior. In the decade before Prohibition
went into effect in 1920, alcohol consumption in the United
States averaged 2.6 gallons per person per year. It fell to O.173
gallons during the Prohibition decade, doubled to 1.5 gallons in
the decade after repeal and is back to 2.6 gallons. </p>

<p> If cocaine were legal, how avallable and affordable would it
be to a fifth-grader? A gram of cocaine sells for about $80 to
$100. Its cost of pruduction is less than $3. What's the least
the government could charge, including tax? The cost would have
to be low enough to make bootlegging unprofitable. If not, we
wouldn't have solved the crime problem, which is what brought us
to legalization in the first place. Let's say the government sets
the price at $20 per gram. </p>

<p> There are about 50 &quot;hits&quot; of cocaine in a gram, so
at $20 per gram a school-child can get a hit for only 40 cents. </p>

<p> What are the chances that we can keep legal cocaine from
fifth-graders? We need only look at our failure at keeping
alcohol from children for an answer. </p>

<p> According to Dr. David I. McDonald, who was the drug-abuse
policy advisor to former President Reagan, if legalization pushed
the number of drug addicts to only half the number of today's
alcoholics, 100,000 people every year will die. Dr. Robert
DuPont, former director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse,
placed the estimate much higher. If one considers the
debilitating effects of cocaine, the carcinogenic effects of
marijuana and the AIDS potential of injecting legalized heroin,
the number of deaths could go as high as 500,000 a year. </p>

<p> Is a society that requires seat belts, infant car seats and
immunizations for children actually considering legalizing a drug
that can kill our unborn, our children, our teens, our adults and
our aged? I can think of no bigger gamble. </p>

<STRONG>The Register's Readers Say

Legal drugs: What about the children?</STRONG>

     Thank you to Karol Crosbie ("Who Will Protect Children from 
Legalized Drugs?" Feb. 21) for putting into words the thoughts I 
have every time I read an article or opinion piece proposing the 
legalization of marijuana, cocaine, heroine or other currently 
illegal drugs.
     Crosbie is right - legalizing these drugs will reduce their 
cost and make them more available to young people.  Legalization 
of these drugs for adult use would in all likelihood increase 
their use among adults (there are people who refrain from illegal 
activities because they view themselves as law-abiding persons).
     Increased public use of drugs by adults will make drug use 
an "adult" thing to do (I can see the TV sitcoms rushing to 
rewrite the story lines now) and being "grown up" is an 
enticement for many young people who use cigarettes and alcohol 
today.
     Let's not take a chance on what legalization of drugs will 
do to our children and society.
                                  -- Ann Burns,
                     315 S. Niagara, Maquoketa.

     Karol Crosbie's comparison of liquor consumption during 
Prohibition was more opinion than fact.  How did she arrive at 
0.173 gallons during Prohibition?  Dandelion and other wines and 
beer were brewed in many homes that bought the same products in 
stores before Prohibition.  No person can have any reliable 
statistic on what was used.  No one who did not live at that time 
can have any idea of what it was like.  People drank canned heat, 
lemon extract, anything that contained alcohol.  Bootleggers 
flourished in every town, and they sure didn't refrain from 
selling to minors.
                         -- John Verbrugge Jr.,
                                     Swea City. 

     Karol Crosbie asks "who will protect children from illegal 
drugs?"  The answer is so simple, I am sure that you will wonder 
why you had not thought of it before: I will protect my children 
and you will protect your children.
     It is not the government's responsibility to protect your 
children; it is your responsibility.  So teach your children 
well.  Teach them to think.  Teach them to learn, teach them to 
act responsibly and to accept the responsibility for their 
actions.  Teach them to respect the rights of all living things.
     With a good education and solid ethical foundation, our 
children will protect themselves from harmful drugs, as well as 
from overly zealous legislators.
                             -- Alan J. Palmer,
               2801 N.W. Polk City Dr., Ankeny.

     One of the problems in drug-policy discussions is that we 
lump all illegal drugs together as if they all posed the same 
potential for abuse.  Another problem is that we are only given 
two choices: (1) complete prohibition, or (2) complete 
legalization. 
     Since Karol Crosbie thinks (and I agree) that alcohol is 
such a problem for youth, perhaps we should take a look at some 
possible remedies.  Should we criminalize the possession of 
alcohol?  If not, then Crosbie's concerns about legalizing other 
substances seem hollow.
     One possible solution would be to consider our laws 
regarding distribution of alcohol to minors.  The penalty for the 
first offense of providing alcohol to a minor is a $100 fine, a 
second offense is $250, a third is $500 and all subsequent 
offenses are a maximum $ 1,000.  Alcohol is possibly the most 
dangerous drug, and giving it to a minor won't even get
you any jail time.
     This is in stark contrast to our treatment of illegal drugs.  
Simple possession of marijuana can get you up to six months in a 
county jail and up to a $1,000 fine for the first offense.  
Giving marijuana to a minor can get you locked up for up to 10 
years and a fine of $10,000.
     Maybe we need a new drug policy that includes all drugs and 
rates them according to their abuse potential.  Under such a 
system, all drugs might be legal for consenting adults.  However, 
it might be illegal to provide any drug to a minor with the 
penalties being consistent with the abuse potential of the drug 
in question.
                              -- Carl E. Olsen,
           recorder, Libertarian Party of Iowa,
               1116 E. Seneca Ave., Des Moines.


<STRONG>It doesn't mean you could buy 'coke' at Hy-Vee</STRONG>

     Karol Crosbie ("Who Will Protect Children from Legalized 
Drugs?") totally misstates the issue.  The argument is not about 
legalizing drugs.  It is, "should they be decriminalized?"
     Crosbie is the only person who, when discussing 
decriminalizing drugs, assumes that to do so will make them 
available at the neighborhood Hy-Vee, gas station or ATM.  I have 
yet to hear any responsible proponent of "decriminalizing" drugs 
suggest that they should be available to the general public.
     By "decriminalizing" drugs, they are made available only to 
addicts who, if unable to obtain them from controlled state 
sources, instead would be stealing your stereo or mugging you to 
get the money to buy them.  That is exactly what is happening 
now.
     There is a fear that by decriminalizing drugs, you might see 
an initial increase in use.  That is a possibility.  There 
probably are some people who might decide that when drugs are 
decriminalized it would be the perfect time to start mainlining 
heroin or snorting cocaine.
     But, on second reflection, is this really likely?  What's to 
stop you, I or anyone from starting to use them right now?  Lack 
of availability?  The market system has made them too available.  
And, there's even a helpful pusher to instruct you on how to get 
started and give you a generous discount until you're hooked.
     The reason you don't use drugs is the same reason I don't.  
And, It's not lack of availability.  We understand that drugs are 
very dangerous.  Spending your day in a drug-induced stupor isn't 
conducive to a good family life or career.
     Education is certainly a very large part of the answer.  But 
to keep our children from using drugs basically means that we 
have to stop those who would push drugs at them from doing so.  
Putting them in jail doesn't work.  There are too many 
replacements.  We accomplish this by taking the enormous profit 
out of selling drugs.  We put them out of business.
     The police will be the first to tell you there is no way 
they can prevent illegal drugs from pouring into Des Moines or 
any other city given the enormous profits.  For every busted 
dealer there are many more willing to take his place.
     So what's to do?  Decriminalization?  I'm not sure that's 
the complete answer.  There are some problems with that too.  But 
let's keep the debate to the point.  Decriminalizing doesn't mean 
that these drugs will be available at your local supermarket.
     Those of you who are adamantly against even thinking about 
decriminalization must like the way things are today.  Rest 
assured that you're not the only ones who feel that way.  The 
pushers are with you on that issue.
                     -- Robert J. Bridge, M.D.,
                             3017 Jordan Grove,
                               West Des Moines.

Dear Mr. Olsen -

     You don't know me, but after reading your article in the Des 
Moines Register, I felt compelled to write you a letter.
     I wanted to let you know that you are not alone in your 
views, and as mcuh as I have read and studied ways to deal with 
the drug problem in America, and especially in Iowa, I have yet 
to come across a solution as workable as the one you suggest.
     As you have probably already noticed, this letter is coming 
to you from a prison.  That's right, a prison.  I sincerely hope 
you are not put off by that, but I could certainly understand if 
you were.  Many people in this state are.  Society in general 
considers us scum, even though we are every bit as human as the 
next person.
     I personally, was sent to prison on a drug-related charge 
stemming from a drug deal gone bad.  I have fought drug addiction 
most of my adult life, and more often than not, I have lost.  I 
am now 26, and trying to win this war.
     I wanted to write to tell you that you, and people like you, 
through letters such as the one the Register printed (a fine 
liberal paper), not only serve to inform and enlighten the 
general public, but also the few drug-addicted offenders that 
take the time to read it, or, even worse, are able to understand 
it.
     Through your efforts you serve a greater purpose that you 
may not even be aware of.  I applaud you for the time you took in 
drafting your letter, and in your attempt to sling the noose, if 
you will, of a problem that may not be solvable.
     But looking back on my own shattered life, the pain I've 
caused, the damage I've done, I see in you a hope not only for 
myself, but for other young people who may destroy themselves 
such as I have.
     William Faulkner once said that &quot;it is any man's right to 
destroy himself, so long as he does it to and of himself.&quot;  I 
wonder ....
     Anyhow, Mr. Olsen, I just wanted to thank you.  Since I 
couldn't do it in person, a letter was my best shot.  Thank you 
for the time you took in reading my letter, and I wish you the 
best of luck in the future.  Peace.
     Sincerely,
     Johnnie Clements

Dear Mr. Olsen,

     Good day, sir.  Thank-you for your letter.  I especially 
appreciate the information that you sent along.  I am finding a 
lot of my own thoughts in other people's words.  Simply amazing!  
I had really no idea that the issue of marijuana legalization had 
such a diverse following.
     I will tell you something of my case.  In Dec. of 1989, my 
brother, Dennis, was involved in the distribution of pot to 
another man, Bruce Kennedy, a resident and business owner of Des 
Moines.  They had been doing business for a number of years with 
no problems.  Towards the end of the year 1989, my brother and 
Kennedy had a falling out.  At the time he owed my brother 
$3,500.00 for pot that had already been delivered.  He refused to 
pay.  On the night of Dec. 7th, 1989, I walked into the business 
that Kennedy owns and demanded that he hand over the cash.  I was 
unarmed, but I was forcefull that he comply.  He did, and handed 
me $3,500.00 in $100.00 bills.  As I was leaving the scene, I 
heard sirens approaching, but I didn't connect them with my 
collection of owed money.  To make a long story short, Mr. 
Kennedy had called the police and told them that I had robbed 
them.  I couldn't believe it!  After the arrest, after the months 
in jail, after the appointment of a largely inept lawyer, a 
public defender, I was brought to trial.  The state refused to 
reduce the charge or offer me a plea bargain because I refused to 
implicate my &quot;brother&quot; in this &quot;scheme,&quot; as they called it.  At 
trial Kennedy and another person whom I've never met, named 
Chris, testified that I walked in, forced them both to the 
ground, and robbed Kennedy at gun point, to give me all of the 
money they had.  They both claim I took $6,000.00 in cash from 
them.  They both state I wore a mask, but no gloves.  They both 
claim they had known me for several years.
     At trial, the state produced no weapon, no fingerprints, no 
money, no shoe prints, nothing except the word of these two 
people.  And Chris, well, he wasn't even there that night.
     Lie number 1) $6,000.00 dollars was taken.  Lie number 2) 
Chris was there.  Lie number 3) I had a gun.  Lie number 4) I 
wore a mask.  There are others, but really too many to write.  I 
found out at trial that the DMPD ident. team never even dusted 
for fingerprints!
     So, it was only 24 hours from voire dire to verdict.  24 
hours!  I would not implicate my brother, I really had no defense 
at all, and I was naive.  I was 19 yrs old and didn't know a 
thing about what was going on.  I was convicted of first-degree 
armed robbery.  Now a lot of people won't believe what I say 
simply because I am a convicted felon, but I know that there was 
a conspiracy between the D.A., Jamie Bowers, and these two 
witnesses, because another D.A. named Ramey (not sure of the 
spelling of his name) took me in his office, laughed at me, told 
me he was going to convict me anyways, because he talked to 
Kennedy and Chris and told them what to say.  He told me this to 
my face, but of course I have no proof that he did so.
     Anyhow, I was sentenced to 25 yrs, and I did 5 yrs 8 mos, 
before I was placed on work-release.  Once there I encountered a 
number of problems.  I went to the work-release at 2020 Center, 
in Des Moines, and after just 45 days I was so stressed out and 
depressed from trying to get myself back into society that I 
started to get high.  My UA's were coming back dirty, so I went 
to work one night and didn't come back.  My work-release was 
revoked, and I was sent back to prison, where I am now.
     A whole lot of things contributed to my coming back to 
prison.  For one, for 5 yrs &amp; 8 mos in prison, my family has 
given up on me.  They refused to stick by me, and now we are 
estranged.
     The people I encountered when I got out were all suspicious 
of me and untrusting.  It seemed everyone I met looked down on 
me.  It was really a drag.  I couldn't believe the way they 
treated me, like I was dirt.  The guy I got a job from ($5.50 hr) 
thought I was a slave and always called me names.  Scum, convict, 
etc. ...  I put up with it for awhile, but soon it just became 
too much.
     On Dec. 8th, 1995, I picked up my last check from work, an 
ounce of bud, a 12 pack of beer, and got a motel room.  For 5 
days I sat in that room, alone, but high.  I had no answer to my 
problems, and I was seriously considering suicide.  I probably 
would have gone through but the police arrested me.  What a way 
my life has went.  All because I collected some money for a pot 
deal.
     But I push on, along, and yes, afraid.  Afraid at how I will 
make it when I get out the next time.  My counselor thinks it 
will be between 5 &amp; 16 months.
     My counselor, and I'm sure, the Parole Board, think that I 
am just another failure.  But I wonder if they realize just how 
difficult it was for me to leave prison.  I was this 19 yr old 
kid when I got locked up, they had me for almost 6 yrs, and then 
one day they come and tell me to get out, go back to society and 
make it for yourself.  It was rough having no family there to 
support me, but I still thought that I could manage.  But in the 
end, it was that lone man calling me a scum, without knowing who 
I really was or what I am really about, that finally pushed me to 
far.  I just felt like I didn't belong.
     And all of this started because I collected money on a debt.  
Kennedy lied about the amount of money so he could collect from 
the insurance more than twice (actually he shouldn't have been 
able to claim any) what he gave to me.  I suppose he made the 
best out of a bad situation, huh?
     Anyhow, I just carry on now, a little wiser, but still angry 
at the system that has tried to destroy my youth.  I could be 
bitter I suppose, but I am better than that.  I see now that if I 
destroy myself.  I have not let the years turn me into a 
hardened, callous person.  In fact, I am quite compassionate, 
happy, full of life, and I will continue to be a force despite 
others who will try to bring me down.  I will succeed in my life, 
one way or another.
     Mr. Olsen, once again I appreciate your letter.  I hope you 
will continue to write me, I can use all the friends I can get.  
You may count me as one of your supporters, and if there is 
anything I can do for you, either now or in the future, please 
let me know.
     As to your desire to print my letters, you may do so by all 
means.  You may also, you are more than welcome to I should say, 
use my name and address.  I would welcome anyone who wishes to 
write me.
     I know that this has turned into a bit of a novel, so I will 
leave you now.  I hope to hear from you again soon, and I look 
forward to going over all of the material you sent me.  Take 
care.  Peace.
     Sincerely Yours,
     Johnnie Clements

<p><strong>Dear Carl - </strong></p>

<p><strong>First, thank you very much for Dr. Grinspoon's book
&amp; other material. </strong></p>

<p><strong>I apologize for my tardiness. That's due to
preparation of supplementary brief in my appeal &amp; health
matters. </strong></p>

<p><strong>The enclosed condenses the story &amp; I am now poised
to sue the feds in a unique approach of emergency petition for
arbitrary, capricious &amp; deliberately indifferent denial of
medicine (i.e., marijuana) resulting in cruel &amp; unusual
punishment (the avoidable infliction of blindness founded in the
fraudulent &amp; deceitful practice of government bureaucracy). </strong></p>

<p><strong>Am kind of in a quandry where to bring it as it ties
into an ineffective counsel claim (V. Kromminga) for failure to
bring my medical necessity defense, but I'm not able to file yet
because Whalen has me on en banc in the 8th Circuit, yet I'm
going blind; so far only my left eye is affected (as far as I
know, but they said I'd probably lose both). </strong></p>

<p><strong>Do you know of any/if legal talent is available
through Illinois NORML? </strong></p>

<p><strong>Also experiencing health difficulties with muscular
sclerosis &amp; sciaticata. My fear: these fuckers are killing
me. No real health problems 'til I got here. Is this the method
they're using to carry out the U.S. Dept. of Justice policy of
incapacitation &amp; debilitation? of repeat pot offenders?
Suspicious to say the least. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Have you read the Feb. 12th issue of National Review's
14 page article &quot;The Drug War is Lost&quot;? If not, I
highly recommend it. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Never did get the address of Associated Press or
United Press from anyone. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Being out of funds &amp; unable to work puts postage
in short supply, so communication is limited. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Regarding the enclosure, you might address Dr. Dawdy
to the effect of your interest and offer any help. The DEA can't
object due to diversion or security. What is the next step if he
refuses? Want to show I tried, obviously, the medicines they're
giving me are wholly ineffective. I know pot works from 20 plus
years of experience. </strong></p>

Roderick T. Harvey
Saline County Jail
Harrisburg, IL 62946

March 22, 1996

Dear Carl,

     It's been awhile since I wrote to you; in fact, it was in 
January.  At that time you made some copies of several of my 
writings (which didn't come out too good on your scanner and 
laser printer, but I thank you very much nonetheless), and you 
also contacted my P.D. attorney, recommending Ed Rosenthal for an 
expert witness.  I was so impressed with your concern and efforts 
on my behalf, and very enthusiastic about the prospect of Mr. 
Rosenthal being a part of my defense.  Unfortunately, the P.D. 
was not so eager to have an outspoken proponent of marijuana on 
the witness stand, and quite possibly he was right.  I say that 
now, after observing to tactics of the prosecutor - Christopher 
More.
     Before I tell you about the latter, let me bring you up to 
date on other happenings.  A week after your very much 
appreciated undertaking to provide me with an expert witness, on 
February 6, the day before my jury selection and trial was to 
begin, I was very unexpectedly released from jail.  After I 
hurriedly got myself well away from the vicinity, I called the 
appointed lawyer to see what the heck was going on; after six 
months and six days being held prisoner with no bond, to be 
inexplicably set completely free with no stipulation whatsoever.  
(?)  Wow!?
     I was informed that it was just a mistake on the indictment, 
having to do with the dates of my alleged manufacturing of 
marijuana, a technicality that would be (probably/maybe) revamped 
and I could (would) then be re-indicted.  I was.  I turned myself 
in the 13th of February (a very foolish, stupid thing to do under 
the circumstances, in view of the fact that I'm a conscientious 
objector being warred against by an unscrupulous enemy who does 
take prisoners and holds them indefinitely), and even though I 
demonstrated good faith, they vehemently refused to give me any 
bond whatsoever (again).  What kind of a country (government) is 
this?  What about Article VIII of the Bill of Rights?  I didn't 
do anything to anybody, I'm just accused of &quot;growing&quot; a harmless, 
natural, God-given plant, way back in the woods.
     Well, no longer just accused, - Wednesday (two days ago), 
March 20, 1996, I was found guilty by a jury (not of my peers), 
and scheduled to be sentenced June 20, 1996.  It took the jury 
five hours to decide.  It was very evident that if I had a 
competent lawyer I would have been acquitted.  I've already 
started preparing my own appeal, on various grounds, including 
inadequate representation.  By the way, the expert witness turned 
out to be a professor from So. Ill. U., but the prosecutor got 
him barred, after he had stated his education, employment and 
qualifications, because of Rule 16, the P.D. had neglected to 
inform the prosecution of this expert witness.  Incompetence?  
(now I go to prison)
     The P.D. told me the trial transcripts would cost me about 
$500, so I'll be unable to acquire them until after I'm 
sentenced, at which time, apparently, he can get me a copy.  Oh!, 
how I wish I had them now, to study, and to show some attorneys 
for legal advice.  the public pretender did such an obviously 
poor job of defending me.  OK, enough said.

later -
     Oh, one other thing you've probably heard before, the 
prosecutor made a big deal out of the fact that they found in 
some of my notes the acronym N.O.R.M.L., and the phone number 
with the last four digits W.E.E.D. (John Hartman).  All they had 
was circumstantial evidence against me, and so they were grasping 
at straws to connect me with marijuana and make me look guilty.

March 31, -
     Thank you again, Carl, for everything you've done for me.

April 2, -
     It's been two weeks now since I've been convicted, and I 
think I've finally got my head screwed back on about halfway 
right, I hope! (phew).  Sorry about not getting this letter 
finished and sent off to you, but I'm sure you understand.
     Altho' these preceding pages may seem to indicate the 
contrary, I'm really coming along fine Carl.  My emotional well-
being and mental outlook has improved immensely since that first 
letter you intercepted last year.  I can't thank you enough.  
Admittedly, I've been in a slump, or a touch of writer's block 
here for a bit, but I'm out of it now and got the ol' pen 
scribblin' like mad.  I have to, I've got a pile of at least ten 
letters here I have to get answered.
     Yes, I've very involved in the Reform Movement and the 
literature has been pouring in.  I'm getting quite a reputation 
here at the jail, I'm proud to say; albeit, I'm more that a 
little suspicious that my mail is being tampered with (more than 
what is legally permissible).  Can you suggest what recourse, or 
action I should take?  If any.
     I received a fantastic letter from Paul Westmoreland last 
week, which really helped me to feel like a part of the solution, 
the movement.  I want to follow in his shoes (as it were), with 
him going as I'm coming.  How I wish I could accomplish as much 
as he has.  With his guidance and support, and others', I will.
     I never would have thought it before, but now I really 
believe that I can help make a difference.  Even from behind 
bars, I'm going to make a difference.  I am astounded at how many 
great people and organizations there are working to restore our 
constitutional rights and freedom; i.e., the Drug Policy 
Foundation, F.A.M.M., M.P.P., Grassroots Party of Minnesota, 
Green Panthers!, VOCALs, TEACH, to name a few.  I'm excited to be 
part of it.  Unfortunately, I had to have my life virtually 
devastated before I woke up, stood up and got active.  I've been 
running away from the big war machine since the early '70s.  
Well, I'm making my stand right here, right now; I'm ready to 
fight.  But I'll fight fair and honest.
     Nobody could believe I turned myself in to the feds.  Not my 
friends, fellow prisoners, marshals, correction officers, the 
prosecution or task force agents; but I'm tired of running from 
the oppressors.  I think I can do more, in a constructive, 
positive way, from within prison than I would out there on the 
run as a fugitive.  We'll see.  (Paul's got me reading damn law 
books every day.)  Wry smile.
     Thanks again Mr. Olsen.  I'll be in touch.
     I see a little light,
     Roderick

P.S. If there's anything I can do for you, NORML, POWs &amp; friends, 
please don't hesitate to ask; I'm anxious to do whatever I can.
     &quot;We can't do everything that we want to do, but sometimes we 
get so involved in letting what we can't do get in the way of 
what we can, that we don't do anything.&quot;  - Dr. Joycelyn Elders

April 11, 1996 </strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear Carl: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Am now at MCFP Springfield, formally diagnosed with
glaucoma. Was treated with laser surgery March 29th &amp; am
subject to further surgery of freezing the gland that produces
fluid to the eye. I have declined the 2nd surgery &amp; requested
treatment by marijuana. I expect the usual obdurate
government/bureaucratic behavior &amp; some form of reprisal for
refusing the freezing surgery. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Perhaps this will generate a cognizable lawsuit for
medicinal marijuana, its scheduling &amp; the deliberate
indifference of the government bureaucrats towards medical
therapeutic use of marijuana &amp; the fact it has to be far more
cost effective than permanently damaging surgery &amp; continuing
use of expensive eye drops (I am currently taking &amp; only
partially effective) &amp; are toxic to boot! </strong></p>

<p><strong>Tom Brown (Arkansas, religious use) is encouraging
this approach. </strong></p>

<p><strong>What the marijuana movement really needs is a viable
class action &amp; the legal horsepower to see it through. Ah,
&amp; honest government!! </strong></p>

<p><strong>Meanwhile we'll see what develops in all the marijuana
cases. </strong></p>

<p><strong>From a national perspective, the war against marijuana
seems to be losing steam as more &amp; more states are eyeing its
potential revenue/tax enhansing base &amp; its many uses in
industrial/commercial scale. The 14 page article in the National
Review (Feb. 12, '96 issue) is telling of a changing mood in
drugs in general. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Appeal-wise, my case looks pretty &quot;iffy&quot; at
best. March 1st got a split decision &amp; am now &quot;en
banc&quot; &amp; in limbo with 6 years to go &#133; awaiting yet
another appellate decision. </strong></p>

<p><strong>If you have any advice on how to better state my
request, or how to be more effective in presenting the request,
or have any pharmacopea or professional opinion to bolster our
position for treatment with marijuana, please send it along. </strong></p>

<title>Officer fired for drugs put on probation</title>

<font size="4"><b>'One-Time Incident'</b></font>

<font size="5"><b>Judge says probation, not prison, for Trimble</b></font>

<font size="4"><b>Prosecutors say</b> the police officer fired by Ubandale
after his drug arrest deserved harsher measures.</font>

<b>By Dan Eggen</b>
Register Staff Writer

     James Trimble, the fired Urbandale police officer who stole 
$20,000 worth of methamphetamine from his department, was spared 
prison Thursday for his felony drug conviction.
     Judge Leo Oxberger sentenced Trimble to two years' 
probation, a $1,000 fine and 100 hours of community service.
     &quot;I'm convinced this is a one-time incident for you,&quot; the 
judge said.  The sentence angered prosecutors, who along with 
presentence investigators recommended up to 10 years in prison 
for the crime.
     Trimble, 44, is required to spend his community-service time 
giving anti-drug speeches to students.  He conducted such talks 
as a police officer in Urbandale schools.

<font size="4"><b>Judge's Explanation</b></font>
     &quot;I do not want you to think that I do not consider this a 
serious crime,&quot; Oxberger told Trimble.  &quot;If this were a crime you 
committed in the course of your conduct as a police officer, I 
would view it differently.
     &quot;I do not believe that any official should be above the law.  
On the other hand, I don't think that any officer or high-
standing official should automatically be sentenced to prison....  
You have rearranged your life and seem well on the way to 
rehabilitating yourself.&quot;
     Jamie Bowers, an assistant Polk County attorney, pointed out 
that Trimble admitted taking drugs from an evidence locker at the 
Urbandale Police Department.
     About 4 a.m. on New Year's Day, Trimble was arrested driving 
his mother's van in an inner-city Des Moines neighborhood.  
Police say they found about 7 ounces - $20,000 worth - of 
methamphetamine, in addition to marijuana, LSD and cocaine.

<font size="4"><b>Videotapes and Pictures</b></font>
     Authorities said numerous sexually explicit videotapes and 
pictures were found in the van, including photos of Trimble.  He 
had a battery-operated sexual device inserted in his body when 
arrested, police said.
     Riding in the van with Trimble was Lorrie Breiholz, 34, who 
was sentenced to probation and a deferred judgment in April for 
misdemeanor marijuana possession.
     The 18-year veteran headed Urbandale's Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education program and acted as liaison officer between police and 
the suburb's schools.  He was fired shortly after his arrest.
     The case raised questions whether Trimble should be treated 
like other first-time drug offenders -- almost all of whom 
receive probation &#150; or as a law officer who shamed his 
profession.
     Bowers and state investigators argued the latter.
     &quot;We recommended that he go to prison based upon the impact 
he had on the community and on the credibility of law 
enforcement,&quot; Bowers said.  &quot;What the judge did depreciates the 
serious nature of the crime. ...  When you're a police officer, 
you're a police officer all the time, not just eight hours a 
day.&quot;
     Trimble, sweat glistening on his face, said nothing during 
or after the sentencing in Polk County District Court.
     &quot;Jim Trimble lost his wife, his job, the respect of the 
community.  He is a pariah,&quot; said Trimble's attorney, Mark 
Pennington.  &quot;I think he's been punished enough.&quot;
     Trimble's wife, who accused him of threatening to kill her 
and commit suicide shortly before his arrest, has filed for 
divorce.  He is unemployed and lives in Urbandale with his 
mother.
     He was charged with five drug crimes, but prosecutors agreed 
to let him plead guilty April 8 to one: possession with intent to 
deliver methamphetamine.
     The crime is a Class C felony, a category that includes 
offenses such as vehicular homicide, involuntary manslaughter and 
third-degree sexual abuse.  It is part of the stiffest category 
of state drug crimes.
     The sentence was not part of the plea bargain.

<font size="4"><b>No Criminal History</b></font>
     Pennington said it is important to note that Trimble had no 
prior criminal history and there was no evidence he bought or 
sold drugs.
     Criminal history is key to determining sentencing: After 
Trimble was sentenced, Bowers said, three other people were sent 
to prison on the same charge -- but they all had prior records.
     Pennington said Trimble's story will be valuable to 
schoolchildren.
     &quot;He has, in his own unique way, taught the kids the ultimate 
lesson: That drugs bring nothing but disaster,&quot; he said.  &quot;He's a 
living example of the destructive power of drugs. &quot;
     But David Hamlin, the Urbandale police chief, said Trimble 
may have difficulty meeting his community-service requirement.
     &quot;I do have some question about how many schools are really 
going to be open to him talking to kids,&quot; Hamlin said.

<font size="4"><b>Mixed Feelings</b></font>
     Hamlin said he has mixed feelings about the sentence, 
considering the black eye Trimble gave the small department.
     &quot;He spent 18 years doing a lot of good work, but he created 
a lot of havoc in recent months,&quot; he said.  &quot;I'm thankful the 
judicial aspect is over, although I'm sure we'll be answering for 
it for some time.&quot;
     Authorities considered charging Trimble with theft but 
decided it would have been &quot;overkill,&quot; given the five drug 
charges against him at the time, Hamlin said.
     District Judge Ray Fenton accepted Trimble's guilty plea and 
would normally handle the sentencing as well.  But Fenton recused 
himself because he said he had known Trimble for many years.
     Oxberger -- who fills in on the Polk County bench -- retired 
in 1994 as chief judge of the Iowa Court of Appeals.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Trimble sentence a travesty of justice</B></FONT>

     Is it any wonder that we continue to have a drug problem 
when the judges refuse to sentence the school drug officer to 
prison for illegal drug activity?  Is our judicial system 
committed to expanding drug usage by sentencing James Trimble to 
probation despite his visible position in the drug discouragement 
(supposedly) process?  What a terrible example this sets for our 
young people.
                                           - Murl 0. Black,
                                 1199 Fifth St., Lohrville.

     I've heard of diplomatic immunity, but I've never heard of 
police immunity.  You mean to tell me that what James Trimble did 
to the children of Urbandale by "not doing what he said" is not 
punishable by more than a $l,000 fine and 100 hours of community 
service?  Where will be do his community service - in the 
Urbandale schools?
     This man could have been made an example of for the children 
he deceived.  Now he is an example of what it means "to get away 
with it."
                                         - Lorraine Powell,
                                   211 Seventh St., Nevada.

     The next time any of us wonders why there is steady moral 
decay in our country, all we have to do is look back at Judge Leo 
Oxberger's decision in the case of ex-Urbandale Police Officer 
James Trimble.  This decision was a mockery of our system of 
justice.
     Not only did Trimble break numerous laws, he broke the 
public trust.  He worked with kids in an anti-drug campaign.  Now 
he has to do 100 hours of community service, again telling kids 
the "evils" of drug use.
     Judge Oxberger's decision further erodes the public trust.
                                              - Ron Nesbit,
                                  1816 79th St., Des Moines.

     The sentencing of James Trimble was such a travesty of 
justice.
     Judge Leo Oxberger said because Trimble was not on duty, he 
would sentence him as an average citizen.  Now, many "average" 
citizens are in prison for using illegal drugs, let alone being a 
police officer who stole drugs from the police department with 
the intent to use and sell (i.e. deal).
     The sentence Trimble received was just this side of nothing.  
The "average" law-abiding citizen works more than 100 hours in a 
two-week period making an honest living.  And, in this day and 
age, what is $1,000?
     What complete hypocrisy serving 100 hours of community 
service by going into schools and telling students that drugs are 
wrong.  Wasn't that Trimble's job at the time of his arrest?  No 
thank you; I don't want this man in the same town as my children, 
let alone going back into the schools to tell them using drugs is 
"wrong."
                                       - Cleoda M. Mikesch,
                               2419 Tomlin Ln., Des Moines.

     I was sickened and appalled over the sentencing of former 
Urbandale Police Officer James Trimble.
     How can such a sentencing be justified?  Would he have 
received such a sentence had he been a poor white or minority 
represented by a public defender?  What message does this 
sentencing send to the public about the importance of public 
trust, the abuse of drugs and hypocrisy?
     It is true, as stated by Judge Leo 0xberger, that the 
defendant has lost much.  But can you imagine the impact his 
crime had on the young people in Urbandale, the police department 
and the public's faith in the system as a whole?
     The judge's reasoning is warped and amazing.  If the 
president of a bank stole $5 million from the bank because of his 
position and the trust of the bank customers, should he receive 
the same sentencing as a person who attempts to pass a check at 
the bank?  I think not.
     It amazes me that members of the judiciary and other 
political persons want the citizens to believe that the system 
works the same for all people who are involved in it.  This is 
obviously not the case.
     Frankly, I am getting sick and tired of it all!  We need 
more responsible judges.
                                           - Lynne Harrell,
                                      4206 S.E. Fourth Ct.,
                                                Des Moines.

Register Staff Writer

     Fired Urbandale police officer James Trimble was arrested 
with $20,000 in stolen methamphetamine  yet he got no jail or 
prison time at all.
     He's lucky he didn't get hauled into federal court.
     In Iowa's state courts, Trimble's sentence was common for 
his crime.  But in federal courts, Trimble could have received 
from five to 15 years imprisonment, with no parole whatsoever.
     Authorities say that federal drug defendants - even first-
timers - commonly get a decade or more of hard prison time, a 
marked difference from their state-prosecuted counterparts.
     "I'd like to know how that's jusice?" cries Edith Davis of 
Des Moines, whose son-in-law is serving 11 years in a Minnesota 
federal prison for two methamphetamine charges.  "I'd like those 
judges to explain how that's justice to my grandchildren, who 
won't know their daddy until they're grown up. ...  If he wasn't 
a cop, that Trimble would've gotten a lot worse."
     The 16-year police veteran was arrested early New Year's Day 
with about 7 ounces - or 196 grams - of methamphetamine, small 
amounts of other drugs, and sexually explicit materials, Des 
Moines police said.  Trimble admitted taking the drugs from the 
evidence room at the Urbandale Police Department where he worked 
as an anti-drug officer in the suburb's schools.
     He was never charged with theft, but he pleaded guilty to 
possession with intent to deliver methamaphetamine, a felony.  
Assistant Polk County Attorney Jamie Bowers asked for a 10-year 
prison sentence, arguing that Trimble abused his public trust as 
a police officer.
     But Judge Leo Oxberger disagreed, giving Trimhle probation 
and ordering him to spend 100 hours of community service talking 
to students about his case.  "I'm convinced this is a one-time 
incident for you," the judge said.
     "If that were one of my 19-year-old clients," said Paul 
Zoss, Iowa's federal public defender, "they'd be throwing the 
book at him over here."

Overrun
     Federal courts are overrun with drug cases as the government 
pursues its "War on Drugs."  In the Suthern District of Iowa, for 
example, federal drug indictments leaped 45 percent from 1994 to 
1995.
     The prison population has soared as a result.  Prisoners 
convicted of drug crimes have ballooned from 25 percent of the 
federal population in 1983 to about two-thirds now.
     Key to the increase is a complicated system of mandatory 
sentences based on the offense the defendant's criminal history 
and the amount of drugs involved.  Not only are the sentences 
rigid, they are tough.
     Zoss said that only the most menial drug possession cases - 
the kind rarely seen in federal court - call for probation, 
meaning that almost everyone goes to prison if convicted.

Distorted?
     The result, many complain, is distorted justice.  For 
example, while some teen-ager might be sent to federal prison for 
five years for a drug crime, a child molester convicted in state 
court may not serve any time at all.
     "You can get swept into all of this and have very little to 
do with the kind of menacing activity you'd associate with such 
harsh punishment," argues Bob Rigg, a former public defender and 
associate law professor at Drake University.
     "The federal system is like a big, sleeping dragon.  If you 
wake it up and it pays attention to you, it'll eat you."
     There are no clear rules about what drug cases are handled 
by the federal system, but they generally involve large-scale and 
often violent drug dealers and their organizations.
     Most complaints concern the treatment given to others - 
people with minor roles in the drug trade.

More Than Enough
     "How cases get here depends a little bit on who initiates 
the case and who refers it to us," said Al Overbaugh, spokesman 
for the U.S. attorney's office in Des Moines.  "We have enough 
that we don't go looking for cases. ...  We have more than we can 
handle as it is."
     Overbaugh pointed out that in its 1994 crime bill, Congress 
provided an escape hatch for minor drug criminals with no past 
record.  In those cases, judges may depart from mandatory minimum 
sentences, he said.
     Davis argues that her son-in-law, Jerry Woolery Jr., was 
punished too severely for his crime.
     Woolery, 25, had a criminal past and admitted to handling 
more than 100 grams of methamphetamine, Overbaugh said.
      "I'm not saying this kid lived a charmed life or anything," 
Davis said of Woolery, who has three sons ages 13, 10 and 7.  
"But this is just too much.
     "Preferential treatment doesn't just hurt people like him," 
she said.  "It hurts society.  It tells us there's a certain type 
of people, like Trimble, who are above everyone else."

<FONT SIZE=+3>An unreasonable system</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Trimble sentence</B> may seem unfair,
but rigid rules would be worse.</FONT>

     There are two systems of criminal justice in the United States: one at 
the federal level; one at the state.  The differences are striking.  You 
need only look at the case of James Trimble - the former Urbandale police 
officer and anti-drug counselor convicted of possessing illegal drugs - to 
see how different.
     Trimble was arrested by Des Moines police five months ago carrying 
more than 190 grams of methamphetamine.  He pleaded guilty to possession 
with intent to sell, and prosecutors recommended a 10-year prison sentence.  
Instead, Judge Leo Oxberger sentenced Trimble to two years' probation, a 
$1,000 fine and 100 hours of community service.
     Critics outraged by Trimble's sentence would have been pleased, 
however, had he been convicted in federal court, where a similar offense 
would likely have resulted in a sentence of as many as 15 years in prison.  
And that is the equivalent of a 30-year sentence in Iowa.  Whereas 
prisoners typically serve less than half their sentences in Iowa state 
prisons, there is no possibility of parole in the federal system.
     Something obviously is out of kilter.  The question is whether it is 
the federal system, or the state.  In general, the Iowa system makes more 
sense, although specific cases - like Trimble's - may seem unfair.  Indeed, 
an example could have been made of Trimble.  He is not just another first-
time offender; he was sworn to uphold the law and entrusted with the 
education of Urbandale schoolchildren.  Surely that makes him worthy of an 
exceptional punishment, if for no other reason than to send a message to 
the very people he was paid to counsel on the evils of drugs.
     In a sense, though, James Trimble is a fitting example of that 
message: He has lost everything because of drugs.  Prison will not "reform" 
him.  He is not likely to repeat his offense.  His cell would be better 
occupied by a potential murderer.
     These are the sorts of difficult issues judges must weigh.  The job 
cannot be reduced to a mathematical formula, although that is what the 
federal system attempts to do.  About 10 years ago, Congress created the 
U.S. Sentencing Commission to establish a set of "guidelines" for criminal 
penalties.  In drug cases, the guidelines take into account the amount of 
drugs seized, prior criminal records, violence involved, use of a gun, 
etc., to arrive at a sentence that must be served in full.  Federal judges 
are, with a few exceptions, unable to depart from the sentencing 
guidelines.
     As a result, in the federal system drug offenders serve very long 
sentences.  It is not unusual to hear of cases of young men convicted of 
merely carrying drugs who will be near retirement age before their release 
from prison.  This policy, the result of macho anti-crime rhetoric in 
Congress, has had tragic consequences for individuals, and for the nation.
     In a recent opinion, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Myron Bright of North 
Dakota cited a Federal Judicial Center study showing that by next year the 
federal prison population is expected to reach 110,000, two and a half 
times that of just a decade earlier, at an annual cost of well over $2 
billion.  And 70 percent of this phenomenal growth has been due to federal 
drug cases.  "The public needs to know that unnecessary, harsh and 
unreasonable drug sentences serve to waste billions of dollars without 
doing much good for society," Bright wrote.  "We have an unreasonable 
system."
     Bright is right; the federal sentencing guidelines are unreasonable.  
It's possible to disagree with a judge's decision in an individual case - 
as some have with Judge Oxberger's sentence in the Trimble case - but on 
the whole the state system works.  As critical as Iowa's prison-crowding 
problem is, it would be magnified exponentially if Iowa judges were forced 
to send every drug dealer to prison for a decade or more and there were no 
chance for parole.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>State legislator wants
change regarding judges</B></FONT>

     <STRONG>Clive, Ia.</STRONG> - A state senator, upset with the sentencing of 
former Urbandale police officer James Trimble, suggested Friday 
that senior judges should not be allowed to decide such cases.
     Sen. 0. Gene Maddox, R-Clive, complained in a newsletter 
that senior judges - who are retired but fill in on the bench 
when needed - are not answerable to the public.
     "I believe we should change the law to add more 
accountability for senior judges and/or to limit their 
jurisdiction to non-criminal offenses," he wrote.  Maddox, a 
former mayor of Clive, sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee and 
is up for relection in the fa11.
     Unlike their full-time colleagues, senior judges are not 
subjected to periodic voter approval.
     The senior judge in the Trimble case, former Iowa Appeals 
Court judge Leo Oxberger, could not be reached for comment 
Friday.
     Oxberger sentenced Trimble to probation and 100 hours of 
oommunity service after Trimble had been arrested with $20,000 
worth of methamphetamine, which he admitted stealing from a 
police evidence locker.  Prosecutors had argued that Trimble 
should go to prison because he violated the public trust as an 
anti-drug officer in Urbandale schools.

Dear Friends,

     Well, I got good news, and bad news, and lets get to the bad 
news first.  On April 29, 1996 the Supreme Court of the United 
States refused to certify my petition for review of my 
conviction.  That means that as far as the court system in the 
United States, there is nothing wrong with my conviction and that 
no change will be made in the near future.  As you can imagine, 
when I learned this on May 3, 1996, I felt like I had been kicked 
in the stomach.  As much as I had tried to prepare myself for 
this eventuality, the reality of it almost beat me into the 
ground.  The fact that I had taken the position that the court 
system could be trusted to follow the Constitution and the Law, 
that the corruption of Judge Waters and his involvement with Don 
Tyson in smuggling cocaine into this country to finance Tyson 
Corporate expansion, Waters corruption in covering up the CIA 
drug smuggling and assassination programs at the Mena, Arkansas 
airport would be uncovered and dealt with, and that the system 
just needed an honest opportunity to work on this, put me in the 
position to be deeply hurt and disappointed by the courts refusal 
to even review the case.

     Now to the good news.  One of the best things about my 
experience here has been that the Truth of the holy teachings of 
a dozen cultures is real and available to those who seek it.  
This Truth is that God is real, that we can reach out in our 
lives and bear incredible pain and sorrow - not through our own 
strength, but through the intercession of something beyond us, 
something that leads us to a higher understanding of life, a 
better way of knowing it.  Unfortunately, one must climb the 
mountain in order to see from the heights, and that climb is 
often uncomfortable and inconvenient.  But the view from the 
heights is not just of a pretty sunset.  From the heights I have 
seen vision and realized a plan of which we are a small but vital 
part.  Let me explain.

     Each of you receiving this letter knows of the persecution 
of those of us who use herbs and plants to better know and 
understand God.  Each of you knows something of how those herbs 
and plants are also food for our body and medicine for our 
illness.  Each of you knows how much pain and suffering have been 
caused by the governments refusal to obey the laws of God and 
man, and why and how they profit from their corruption.  Now I 
see more clearly than before how my life fits into war, and how 
to take the next steps in this particular battle.  Enclosed with 
this letter is a copy of a photo-item from the New York Times.  
It is of a Catholic nun who was beaten, tortured and raped by 
Guatemalan military personal acting under advise of U.S. CIA 
operatives.  She is picketing the White House, trying to get the 
government to admit to and stop this despotic activity on the 
part of the CIA and military intelligence operatives.  Of course 
we know of Mena, Arkansas and how the drugs smuggled into Mena 
went to pay for these same murders and tortures.  Our Church is 
deeply involved in pulling down these rogue operations.  My place 
here is simply not comparable to this nuns service to the poor 
of central america, and the torture it cost her.  We are however 
waging the same war, and with God's help we will prevail.  Every 
time I think of her, of Archbishop Romero murdered in his Church, 
the Jesuit Priests of the University in El Salvador murdered 
along with their housekeeper in their front yard, I realize how 
small a price I have to pay to place myself on the path of Truth 
along with them.  Please offer a special ceremony and prayers, 
each in your own tradition, in the memory of these martyrs and in 
hopes that our fight against this EVIL may change the balance 
enough to end it.

     It is true that I have been beaten up pretty badly so far.  
The corruption of the Federal Judge Waters in Fayetteville, 
Arkansas, has poisoned the possibility of defense to these 
charges, and his corruption is covered by Reagan/Bush appointees 
to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and now by the Supreme 
Court itself.  All is not lost however.  I am now preparing a 
motion to the court to overturn my conviction due to a lack of 
Federal jurisdiction under the Commerce Clause of the 
Constitution.  Congress has the power to regulate commerce 
between the states and between this nation and other countries.  
Commerce within a state is under state control, and non-
commercial activities are exempt entirely from Federal Controls.  
I have been convicted of growing plants in violation of federal 
law.  I have not been accused of engaging in any commerce 
whatsoever, and Hemp is not an item of interstate or intrastate 
commerce at this time at all.  Therefore the Federal government 
lacks jurisdiction to enforce a prohibition law forbidding my 
growing of a plant.  In addition, The very first line of the 
Declaration of Independence invokes Natural Law, the law given to 
us by God as a part of our creation.  "When in the course of 
human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the 
political bonds which have connected them to another, and to 
assume, among the powers of the Earth, the separate and equal 
station to Which the laws of Nature and Nature's God entitle 
them. . ."  So here in the first official document of our nation, 
the document which explains why our forefathers had to murder the 
legal representatives of their King, in order to end his despotic 
reign over them, this document begins by invoking and declaring 
the Natural Law of God.  This is the same Natural Law that Judge 
Waters would not allow me to present to the jury.  This Natural 
Law is not written down, it is the law which God made the 
Universe to operate under.  For instance if you take a green 
plant into a dark room, it will die, because it needs the Sun in 
order to live.  This is not a law passed by a congress and 
written down, it applies everywhere in the Universe, and all 
God's creation is subject to it.  Sometimes a man has understood 
this law, and has written it down to teach others.  One place we 
find this is in the Bible in Genesis - the teachings of the 
beginning.  In Genesis, Chapter 1, Verse 29, God address Adam, 
the first man, and says, "Behold I have given you every herb 
bearing seed, which is upon the face of the Earth. . . and it 
shall be for your meat."  Today, of course, the Federal 
Government says it has the right to prohibit us from growing and 
using the plants God has given to us.  This was foretold in the 
first letter to Timothy written by St. Paul, Chapter 4, Verse 1, 
where Paul reports the only direct spirit teaching of all the 
epistles, saying, "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the 
latter times some shall depart from the faith, and giving heed to 
seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in 
hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 
forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which 
God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which 
believe and know the TRUTH."  We of Our Church know of the TRUTH 
of the food, medicine, the spiritual MEAT that Hemp Flowers are, 
that the peyote cactus is, and we know of the documents that show 
that the government knows this TRUTH also.  And we know how the 
government, in the form of Judge Waters and Prosecutor Bill 
Cromwell, have conspired in secret meetings to stop us from 
showing a jury these same government documents.  But while they 
exercise POWER, it is not their right, just their opportunity.  
They only have the right to exercise power within the confines of 
the Constitution and Federal Law.  They have the opportunity 
because they are presently government employees whose orders 
other agents are willing to follow and not question.  And we have 
stood up to them, we who have no power but the right of God and 
the recognition of the TRUTH we have forced them to flagrantly 
violate their own laws in order to defeat us.  This places us in 
a very strong position.  If we continue to persevere in this 
TRUTH, with our words and our lives, we will take the high 
ground, and our rule will be in Truth and not in their Lies.

     I am asking each of you to do a few things for me in the 
next month or so.  Write to your local paper and point out how 
our own government was founded on natural law, the Law of God, 
how this present government is violating that law of God by 
prohibiting any of us from growing the plants God has given to us 
all as our birth right.  Point out that whenever a government has 
gone against the laws of God, it has fallen.  There are some 
questions that may be arguable, but possession of the plants God 
created when He created us and gave them to us with a contract 
written down in the Bible, is not arguable.  Then send a copy of 
that letter to each of your congresspersons.  Tell them how we 
have gone forward in a non-violent way, notifying all responsible 
parties of our each and every move, and of how the court of Judge 
Waters has perverted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and is 
denying us our right to exercise our religion.  Remind them that 
Thomas Jefferson himself warned us that it might be necessary to 
spill the blood of tyrants to protect the Constitution and our 
rights from an abusive government.  Plead with them to reconsider 
their position of attempting to prohibit us from growing any 
plant given to us by God - as a matter of moral principle.  
Promise them that we will continue to attempt to inform them in a 
moral and non-violent manner.  Warn them that in light of Waco 
and Ruby Ridge, that obvious corruption like that of the plant 
prohibition laws and the drug smuggling at Mena by government 
agents, will act as a corrosive acid on the fabric of our nation 
and may end up burning those who try to wrap their corruption in 
the flag of our Nation.

     Keep up your praying and gathering in the Sight of God.  We 
are right, on the facts and the law.  We will prevail against 
this corruption in time.  We must be willing to invest that time 
in the fight.  I am, and I call on you to commit that investment 
also.  In February of this year, in U.S. v. Bauer, 75 F.3d 1366 
(available at your local law library), the Ninth Circuit 
overturned a conviction identical to mine.  The Supreme Court has 
refused to review my case, but I believe that they are reviewing 
Bauer, and that when they do I will be able to use it to overturn 
my own conviction.  If that happens all that I have lost will 
come back to me except the time I have spent in prison.  I may 
gain an equal amount of time to live just  because of the justice 
we will achieve and be able to live under.  I am now filing a 
lawsuit to get marijuana here for our Rastafarian Church.  More 
on that later.  Take care - - LOVE

Dear Carl,

     Thanks for Greg Pecks appeal brief.  It made for 
interesting reading.  It looks pretty good.  I thought it was 
weak on the RFRA'93 issue, that there is a lot to be demanded in 
the way of the Yoder and Sherbert decisions being the examples of 
correct adjudication - as I attempted to do in my Supreme Court 
brief.  You got that didn't you?  But, it's all there, and any 
reasonable man must agree that Greg gets a new trial or whatever 
and a decision on the merits of the issue and not some judges 
fantasy of what he wants the issue to be.  I just got the 
decisions on the three civil rights lawsuits against the county 
jail and the civil forfeiture of the Our Church of Antioch 
property.  They turned then all down.  The civil rights issues 
included the right to religious services in the jail in the same 
manner as the other churches got, access to religious texts and 
documents which included the DEA rescheduling petition and the 
DOT reports on marijuana and driving, access to a law library for 
a pro per indigent defendant, and overcrowding.  All the case law 
both in and out of the circuit including Supreme Court said I had 
the law library, the documents and the church services for sure.  
The civil forfeiture issue was whether or not the State could 
deny a transfer of title to an unincorporated church, without 
consideration of the RFRA'93.  The court said no problem, the 
state could do anything it wanted, and the RFRA'93 wasn't worth 
shit.  Neither was any of the other Eighth Circuit precedent.  
Needless to say they have not published these decisions even 
though they are cases of first impression in the Circuit and the 
Country for that matter.  So this is the way they bury the death 
squad victims, no public notice, no public notices!  You warned 
me about the unlikelyhood that the court would do justice in this 
case.  You are right.  Next time be sure to advise the sucker 
that the circuits don't give a shit about what they have 
previously decided in the same issues and that they just don't 
publish the case so no ones the wiser.  I am real mad about this, 
I had no expectation that they would fix the game this way, what 
a fool I am.  Now, how the fuck am I going to pull this one out 
of the hat.  Well I already know that I won't, in all the cases 
where I have gotten myself into this kind of fix, God took a 
hand, or at least some force beyond my control.  Now let's watch, 
I got a feeling this is going to turn around, but for the life of 
me I don't know how.  They got all the advantage and I got 
nothing they seem to care about.  I am filing for rehearing and 
will go to Supreme.  Will it do any good?  I am also working on 
the jurisdiction issue, and got some good stuff.  Will send it to 
you soon.  Take care and remember your prayers, boy I got nothing 
else.

<h1>Chapter One</h1>

<h2>Our Constitution Has Been Suspended</h2>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>Since March 9, 1933, the United States has been in a
    state of declared NationalEmergency. </i><br>
    <b> -Senate Report 93-549</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When in the course of human events, ordinary citizens have
reason to fear their government, it's time to look seriously at
cause and cure.</p>

<p> Government officials are supposed to be instruments by which
we, the people, govern ourselves. Under a constitutional
government, the citizens are the ruling class. All other offices
are subservient to the citizens. How did citizens become the
subjects of government and government officials become the ruling
class?</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Government Has Achieved Ability to Rule by Decree</h2>

<p>The US Constitution was basically the shackles placed on the
federal government by a sovereign people. The people possessed
God-given rights. These rights were only secured by the
constitution. All rights not specifically granted to the
government were reserved for the people.</p>

<p> This country started out as a constitutional republic, that
is, a union of sovereign nation states. The federal government
was to be an agent of the states. </p>

<p> As a safeguard, the constitution provides that during times
of rebellion or invasion, the president may assume all powers.
These emergency powers should end after the crisis. President
Lincoln assumed all powers during the Civil War. Since he was
dealing with a rebellion, we may say that he established a
constitutional dictatorship.</p>

<p> Since then, however, the definition of
&quot;emergencies&quot; requiring total control has been
stretched to include economic problems, social imbalances, and
perceived threats to the US by a foreign country's actions on
another continent. When authoritarian control is exerted during
times other than rebellion or enemy invasion, it is an
unconstitutional dictatorship. The federal government has
overstepped the bounds placed on it by the constitution.</p>

<p> Through the insidious, yet steady encroachment of
&quot;emergency powers,&quot; the government has now achieved the
ability to rule the people by statute or decree, without the vote
or consent of the ruled. Through a maze of political maneuvers,
the emergency powers granted to President Franklin D. Roosevelt
in 1933 to deal with an economic depression have become part of
the US Code as permanent everyday powers. America has continued
under the &quot;unconstitutional dictatorship&quot; of war and
emergency powers to this day, more than 60 years later.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Emergency Rule Means Government Owns All Rights</h2>

<p>In reality, under this &quot;unconstitutional
dictatorship,&quot; the roles have been reversed. We have no
rights except those the government grants us. Under our
constitutional government, we the people had all rights except
those specifically granted to the government.</p>

<p> We have lost our constitutional rights. How did it happen?
What does it mean? What can we do about it? Increasingly, US
citizens are unwilling to be the pawns of arbitrary and
capricious decrees. We have both the right and duty to reclaim
our country.</p>

<p> The government today, with its inflated bureaucracy,
political posturing, and ineffectual programs, would be a
laughingstock if it weren't for the sinister side - arbitrary
seizure of property without proven cause by many government
agencies, federally mandated but unfunded programs that choke the
states' right to rule themselves, an unsound money system, and a
de facto economic depression for the last 10 years. Add a growing
separation between &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have nots&quot;
and we have a powder keg on a short fuse.</p>

<p> Government has grown so big, so unreachable, that the
ordinary citizen feels helpless to influence it. Government by
the people? Even those with clout and political savvy, such as
state governors, seem unable to sway D.C.</p>

<p> Government acts like a tyrant gone rampant, wilfully imposing
its policies on citizens, protecting its image, and covering up
its mistakes. Fear sets in when we realize that the government
can play kickball with our lives - and there is no one to stop
it. Today, with our constitutional rights effectively suspended,
we are at the mercy of the giant. </p>

<p> Hitler used Germany's emergency powers clause (Article 48) to
perpetrate his atrocities. Granted, no US president has even
approached Hitler's dictatorship, but he has the power to do so.
The difference is the degree of benevolence with which the US
government has ruled and with which Hitler ruled.</p>

<p> The US constitution provides for the president to be granted
emergency powers in times of war or enemy attack. The fatal flaw
in the constitution, however, is that once the president has
these powers, he himself must give them up. Eleven presidents,
both Democrat and Republican, have failed to reinstate the
constitution and give up these emergency powers. Today we see the
president and entrenched bureaucracy passing rules through the
executive branch's many agencies without challenge from the other
two branches of government - the congress and the judiciary.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>We Have Been Under Emergency Rule for 61 Years</h2>

<p>Senate Report 93-549, written in 1973, said &quot;Since March
9, 1933, the United States has been in a state of declared
national emergency.&quot; It goes on to say:</p>

<p> &quot;A majority of the people of the United States have
lived all their lives under emergency rule. For 40 years,
freedoms and governmental procedures guaranteed by the
constitution have, in varying degrees, been abridged by laws
brought into force by states of National emergency. In the United
States, actions taken by government in times of great crisis
have... in important ways shaped the present phenomenon of a
permanent state of National emergency.&quot;...</p>

<p> &quot;These proclamations give force to 470 provisions of
federal law. These hundreds of statutesdelegate to the President
extraordinary powers, ordinarily exercised by Congress, which
affect the lives of American citizens in a host of
all-encompassing manners. This vast range of powers, taken
together, confer enough authority to rule this country without
reference to normal constitutional process.</p>

<p> &quot;Under the powers delegated by these statutes, the
President may: seize property, organize and control the means of
production; seize commodities; assign military forces abroad;
institute martial law; seize and control all transportation and
communication; regulate the operation of private enterprise;
restrict travel; and, in a plethora of particular ways, control
the lives of all American citizens.&quot;</p>

<p> Today most of the people living in the US have not been
taught the constitution, have never enjoyed the constitutional
rights for which our forefathers fought a revolutionary war, and
know that something is terribly wrong with our government yet
have no idea what to do about it.</p>

<p> Knowledge is power. Once the American people understand what
has happened, they will demand just and reasonable action. It was
said of the Revolutionary War against Great Britain in 1776 that
the real revolution occurred in the hearts and minds of the
American people before a shot was fired. God grant that we may
have a revolution in the hearts and minds of the American people
without a shot being fired.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>Chapter Two</h1>

<h2>What the Government Can Do When the Constitution is Suspended</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is not the function of the government to keep the
    citizen from falling into error; it is the function of the
    citizen to keep the government from falling into error.<br>
    <b> -US Supreme Court</b></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Good People Get into Trouble</h2>

<p>You probably think that if you lead a straight life and obey
the rules, you aren't going to get into trouble, right? Wrong.
Consider these examples:</p>

<p> Diane, a soft-spoken school teacher, was called to serve on
the grand jury. She was asked to fill out a lengthy form
disclosing everything about herself, including how much money she
made, how much her house was worth, what kind of car she drove,
etc. She would not answer the questions because she thought this
was an invasion of privacy and she didn't see how it affected her
right to serve on a jury. The judge had her arrested for contempt
of court and jailed.</p>

<p> Linda, a young mother, was getting ready to go to work one
morning when a Child Protective Service worker showed up on her
doorstep. She insisted on coming in, inspecting the house and
four-year-old Johnny, and looking for signs of child abuse. Linda
showed up at work in tears two hours later, but it wasn't over.
She received a call at work asking both her and her husband to
come in for an interview. More grilling. Files were made on the
parents. The young couple had to supply references, and the child
protective service worker called these people asking if they had
seen any signs of child abuse. The visits and interviews
continued for six months. The reason for all this? Someone called
in a &quot;tip.&quot; The agency refused to tell the young couple
who called, but it didn't take them long to figure out it was a
former friend who held a grudge. </p>

<p> Janette and Bob were selling a house and buying another one.
In the packet of forms for the closing was a report that a woman
with the same first and last names, but a different middle name
and a different social security number, had declared bankruptcy
six years previously. Janette had to prove that she wasn't that
person, including getting forms notarized, which required going
to three different bureaucracies. Janette's realtor told her that
since November, 1993, buyers' names are run through a computer,
which sometimes comes up with 25 or so similar names. The buyer
has to prove he is none of those people.</p>

<p> Don got a notice in the mail from his bank that his account
had been attached by the IRS. No notice, no warning, no reason,
no appeal. Bob owned a piece of land some distance from his home.
When he visited it, he found that it had been confiscated by the
government because they had found illegal drug activity on it. He
had to prove he was not involved and had no knowledge of it
before he could have his land back.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Government Agents May Knock Down Our Doors</h2>

<p>A crippled old black man was in bed asleep one night when a
drug squad burst in and sprayed him with bullets. They claimed he
was resisting arrest. The squad had a tip that a young man who
sometimes visited the elderly gentleman was into drugs, but the
young man didn't live there and in fact, wasn't there that night.
The slain man's son, a well-known sports figure, demonstrated on
TV how crippled his father was and how he would have had to go
through a series of slow and painful maneuvers to even sit up on
the side of the bed.</p>

<p> The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms fiasco in Waco,
Texas was played out on national TV. What isn't widely known is
that the original warrants were for a total of $400 for two guns
suspected of not having had the excise tax paid on them. This
justified attacking a private residence with a riot squad, laying
siege to the compound for two months at a cost of over a million
dollars a day to taxpayers, imprisoning and torturing men, women
and children for over two months without benefit of charges being
filed or a trial being held, and in the end the deaths of 86
people plus four ATF troopers. Incidentally, the survivors were
acquitted by a jury of charges of conspiracy to commit murder.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Senseless Rules Waste Our Time</h2>

<p>A young couple wanted to pull their trailer from Virginia to
Texas, but the trailer was unlicensed. He called his mom in Texas
to buy him a trailer license. Mom called the licensing office in
the county in which the son lived and told them what she needed,
inquired about their hours and explained that she was 60 miles
away. When she arrived, they refused to issue a license on the
trailer because she did not have proof that the car which would
pull the trailer had insurance. Her explanations that the car was
in Virginia fell on deaf ears. So too did her question as to why
they didn't tell her that before she drove 120 miles round trip.
She went back home and called the local county agency and they
told her just to bring in any proof of insurance on any car.
Makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Guilty Until We Prove Ourselves Innocent</h2>

<p>If you are found with more than $10,000 cash on your person,
it can be confiscated. You must prove how you earned it and that
it is legally yours.</p>

<p> If you deposit or withdraw $10,000 or more from your bank
account, the bank is required by law to report it to the IRS.</p>

<p> If you get in trouble with one agency, another agency often
investigates you (usually the IRS). </p>

<p> These are just a few everyday examples of real people and
their small and large troubles with government agencies.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Examples Are Common in Everyday Life</h2>

<p>These situations are so common that you can easily find other
examples in the problems of your family and friends.<br>
<b>Some Acts Are Inherently Wrong;<br>
Others Are Just Against the Rules</b></p>

<p> We are not saying there should be no punishment for crimes.
Some acts are inherently wrong - murder, rape, kidnapping, arson,
etc. But some acts are &quot;crimes&quot; only because some
legislative body or bureaucrat has made a law that says it is.
Another agency may even have a conflicting rule. These
&quot;crimes&quot; change regularly depending on who is in power.
Legal terminology makes the distinction between malum se - evil
in itself, versus malum prohibitum - a crime because someone has
made a law against it.</p>

<p> The story of Daniel in the Bible illustrates this point.
Daniel was accustomed to praying every day from his window. The
ruler made it against the law for anyone to pray. Daniel
continued to do so. He was seized and thrown into the lion's den
because he broke the law.</p>

<p> In our case, our liberties have been taken from us and are
being sold back to us in the form of licenses.</p>

<p> A person doesn't stop knowing how to drive if he misplaces
his drivers license. A merchant doesn't lose his ability to run a
business if he has no commercial license. A farmer doesn't stop
being a steward of the land if he doesn't get a pesticide
applicator's license. </p>

<h2>Restricted Liberties Have Not Bought Safety</h2>

<p>Even though many of our liberties have been taken, the system
still isn't working. The streets are not safe, drugs and violence
are rampant in schools, young couples can't make a living for
their families, many elderly are starving and neglected, and
millions of Americans can't afford health care. Restricted
liberty did not buy us safety and well-being.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>What Can't the Government Do to Us?</h2>

<p>What can government agencies do to us if they suspect us of
not following their arbitrary edicts that may change tomorrow?
Anything they wish. They can and do:</p>

<p> </p>

<ol>
    <li>Rob our time and productivity with senseless rules
        paperwork. </li>
    <li>Invade our privacy. </li>
    <li>Take our money and property. </li>
    <li>Throw us in jail. </li>
    <li>Take our children from us. </li>
    <li>Ruin our reputation.<t> </li>
    <li>Kill us. </li>
</ol>

<h2>We Have No Recourse</h2>

<p>Do we have any recourse? Not really. Most people don't have
the time and money to fight. Our only hope is big media attention
and public outcry. Few have the ear of the media. We are alone
when we are pitted against the various government agencies with
their awesome and arbitrary power.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Chapter Three</h1>

<h2>Why the Revolutionary War Was Fought</h2>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>Since the close of the last war, the British
    Parliament, claiming the power of right to bind the people of
    America by statute in all cases whatsoever ...</i> <b>-
    Declaration of Rights, 1774</b></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>England Looked on Colonies as Property</h2>

<p>The colonists were in a new land fending for themselves. They
either learned self-reliance and responsibility or they didn't
survive.</p>

<p> England gave them no help to speak of. To England, America
was a group of trading companies whose purpose was to further
Great Britain's dominion over the world. King George regarded
England as the owner of the colonies and the colonists, and
exploited as he pleased.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2> Colonies Had No Sound Money System</h2>

<p>The colonies had no official money. They were greatly hampered
in trade by the many different types of trade &quot;coin.&quot;
They used furs, tobacco, wampum (mussel shells made into beads),
French louis, English guineas, German thalers, Dutch ducats,
Spanish doubloons, and the Spanish milled dollar, or piece of
eight. </p>

<p> England ignored the needs of the colonies and made no effort
to provide gold or silver coin or small change currency.</p>

<p> The Massachusetts Bay Company started minting coins in Boston
in 1652. Other colonies and individuals tried minting projects
but generally failed. The new land still did not have a standard
money. </p>

<h2> England Levies Taxes on Colonists to Finance War</h2>

<p>The British got into a war with Spain. They needed more and
more wealth to pay for it. They took more and more from the
colonies.</p>

<p> The British levied taxes on tea and tobacco and stamps to
raise money for the war. They made arbitrary rules and expected
the colonists to obey. The rules could change at any time.</p>

<p> The colonists began to complain of &quot;taxation without
representation.&quot; </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>England Uses Force</h2>

<p>The British tightened the rules. They put on shows of force.
They attacked villagers, burned towns, and plundered the coasts
and seas. The final blow was when the colonists learned large
numbers of foreign mercenaries were sailing toward the new world
in order to subdue the colonists. </p>

<h2>Colonists Declare Independence</h2>

<p>Representatives of the people met in Philadelphia in 1776 to
decide what to do. After long and bitter debate and soul
searching, these men asked Thomas Jefferson to draft the
Declaration of Independence to tell the world why the colonists
were cutting their ties with Great Britain.</p>

<p> Let's look at some excerpts. The second paragraph says:</p>

<p> &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of
government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of
the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new
government, laying its foundation on such principles, and
organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most
likely to effect their safety and happiness...&quot;</p>

<p> It goes on to say this step is not taken lightly, that the
colonists have been very patient. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Complaints Against King George</h2>

<p>It begins to set forth the complaints against King George.
Several complaints deal with his refusal to make fair laws, to
make needed laws, to allow representation by the colonists, and
his dissolving bodies of representatives repeatedly when they
disagreed with him.</p>

<p> Then we come to these complaints: &quot;He has made judges
dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and
the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>

<p> &quot;He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent
hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and to eat out
their substance.</p>

<p> &quot;He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing
armies, without the consent of our legislatures. &quot;He has
affected to render the military independent of, and superior to,
the civil power.</p>

<p> &quot;He has combined with others to subject us to a
jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by
our laws, giving his assent to their acts of pretended
legislation.</p>

<p> &quot;For quartering large bodies of armed troops among
us:...&quot;</p>

<p> We have some of these situations today.</p>

<p> The ending words:</p>

<p> &quot;And for the support of this declaration, with a firm
reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually
pledge to each other our lives, our fortune, and our sacred
honor.&quot; With the signing came seven long years of bloodshed
and destruction.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Chapter Four</h1>

<h2>Rights the Constitution Guaranteed Us</h2>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>The powers not delegated to the United States by the
    constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are
    reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.</i> <b>-
    United States Constitution</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the colonists declared themselves independent, they had
already begun to think of themselves as a new people, as
Americans.</p>

<p> After they defeated the British, they were determined never
again to be the subjects of tyrants and despotism, either from
without or within.</p>

<p> They began to hammer out the philosophy of the United States.</p>

<p> First they formed into a loose confederation of states. One
problem was that the individual states could easily ignore the
confederation, and there was nothing to prevent one state
declaring war on another, as was common in Europe.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>States Rights Versus Federal Supremacy</h2>

<p>Out of this grew a great debate between the Federalists and
the Anti Federalists. </p>

<p> The Federalists felt that a stronger union was needed to
ensure domestic peace, represent the new country abroad, protect
the country, and strengthen the growing nation.</p>

<p> The Anti Federalists feared a strong central government would
put them back into a situation like the one they had fought to
overthrow for seven years.</p>

<p> Eventually a consensus was reached. The Constitution of the
United States was drafted. Its great purpose was to preserve
peace on this continent and ensure liberty. Americans became
citizens of both their states and the new nation. Because of this
dual citizenship, the American Constitution formed a federal
republic.<br>
(It was a republic because not everyone could vote. Only free
white males could vote. The country did not become a democracy
until the constitution was amended to allow everyone the right to
vote, including African-Americans, Indians, and women.) Coming
out of oppression and despotism, the founding fathers tried to
craft a constitution that would ensure equality, opportunity and
justice for all, for all time. </p>

<p> They spelled out the rights of the people and said that all
rights not specifically given to the federal government or the
states were reserved for the people.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Human Beings Have Inalienable Rights</h2>

<p>The Constitution clearly stated that all human beings have
certain inalienable rights just because they belong to the human
species. Among these inalienable human rights are the right to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Constitution
sought to form a government with the consent of the governed, one
that would ensure domestic tranquillity, a common national
defense, and promote the general welfare and secure the blessings
of liberty for everyone.</p>

<p> Individual rights were reinforced with the &quot;bill of
rights&quot; (the first ten amendments), and other amendments
later on. (The complete Constitution may be found in the
Appendix.)</p>

<p> Let`s look at the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. At
the same time, let's think about whether these <$irights;constitutional vs. reality>rights
are real for us today, or whether they exist on paper only.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Article One - Freedom of Speech, Religion, Press</h2>

<p>Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging
the freedom of speech, or of the press; or of the right of the
people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for
a redress of grievances.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Article Two - Right to Bear Arms</h2>

<p>A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a
free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall
not be infringed.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Article Three - No Soldiers Quartered in Peacetime</h2>

<p>No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house,
without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war but in a
manner to be prescribed by law. </p>

<h2>Article Four- No Unlawful Search and Seizure</h2>

<p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,
shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon
probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons
or things to be seized.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2> Article Five - Grand Jury Indictment Required</h2>

<p>No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise
infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand
jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in
the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public
danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to
be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled
in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of
law; nor shall <$iprivate property;not to be taken for public use>private
property be taken for public use, without just compensation.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Article Six - Right to Speedy Trial </h2>

<p>In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right
to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state
and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which
district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be
informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be
confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory
process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the
assistance of counsel for his defense.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Article Seven - Right to Trial by Jury</h2>

<p>In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall
exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be
preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise
re-examined in any court of the United States, than according to
the rules of common law.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Article Eight - No Excessive Bail or Punishment</h2>

<p>Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines
imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments be inflicted.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Article Nine - People Retain Rights Not Assigned</h2>

<p>The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall
not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the
people.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Article Ten - All Other Rights Go to State or People</h2>

<p>The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to
the states respectively, or to the people. </p>

<h2>Other Rights Assured the People</h2>

<p>In addition, slavery was abolished by Article 13. Article 14
made citizens of all persons born or naturalized in the United
States and forbade any state to abridge the privileges and
immunities of citizenship.</p>

<p> The15th Amendment said the right to vote shall not be denied
by the United States or any state on account of <$irace;and right to vote>race,
color, or previous condition of servitude.</p>

<p> The 24th outlawed poll taxes. The 19th Amendment gave women
the right to vote. The 26th Amendment lowered the voting age to
18.</p>

<p> With this collection of amendments, the right to vote was
finally given to all adults.</p>

<p> Thus the founding fathers laid out our rights clearly and
plainly in common language after much debate and soul-searching. </p>

<h1>Chapter Five</h1>

<h2>What We Have Lost</h2>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>A majority of the people of the United States have
    lived all their lives under emergency rule.</i> <b> - Senate
    Report 93-549</b></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>We Have Lost Our Constitutional Rights</h2>

<p>Today we are presumed guilty until we prove ourselves
innocent. Today we have Big Brother watching us, invading our
privacy, gathering information and controlling our lives. We have
all but lost our right to keep and bear arms. </p>

<p> We are not secure in our persons, houses, papers and effects
against unreasonable searches and seizures. We are subjected to
electronic snooping, wiretapping, and <$idrug raids>drug raiders
kicking down our door at any time. Wrong door? Sorry.</p>

<p> We are subject to confiscation of property and bank accounts
at any time by various government agencies.</p>

<p> We are subject to Child Protective Services invading our
homes to make us prove we don't abuse our children.</p>

<p> We are held to answer for &quot;crimes&quot; without benefit
of charges being filed or a trial being held.</p>

<p> The news is full of people being tried twice for the same
crime, in criminal court and in civil court, or on criminal
charges, then on federal charges.</p>

<p> We do not enjoy speedy trials. Several years may lapse before
a case is tried. We are not allowed trial by jury in civil cases
unless we file a petition and pay for it in advance. Most civil
cases are not heard by juries.</p>

<p> Bail and fines are excessive if the accused has no hopes of
meeting them, and that is often the case. The amount of time and
money it takes to appeal a government agency confiscation or
ruling is prohibitive to the common working man or woman. Cruel
and unusual punishment? The world saw what happened at Waco.
Texas. This was cruel and unusual punishment without benefit of
charges, trial or conviction.</p>

<p> The Constitution says all legislative powers herein granted
shall be vested in the congress. Where does it mention the
Federal Register, a device by which a proposed law can be
published by a government agency or bureau-cracy, a certain time
allowed for public comment, and then the law cemented without
regard for what the comment was? Hundreds of proposed rules and
regulations are published here each week. Most people have never
heard of the Federal Register.</p>

<p> The president can also make law by executive orders and
proclamations.</p>

<p> Congress was given the power to coin money and to regulate
the value thereof. So why does the Federal Reserve do this today?</p>

<p> Congress was given the power to declare war. So why does the
president order invasions without counsel of the congress?</p>

<p> Congress was given the right to call forth the militia to
suppress insurrections and repel invasions. So why does the
president declare martial law and use federal troops inside the
US? Why does the president maintain a standing army among us?</p>

<p> The Constitution says &quot;No capitation or other direct tax
shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration
herein before directed to be taken.&quot; The amendment
establishing the income tax was passed when few congressmen were
present, and many say illegally.</p>

<p> <t>The Constitution says &quot;The privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless in cases of invasion
or rebellion the public safety may require it.&quot; This means
that a person should be brought before the court and charged with
the alleged crime. This clause means it is illegal to hold
someone without charging them with a crime.</p>

<p> &quot;No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be
passed.&quot; What do you call a retroactive income tax
regulation?</p>

<p> &quot;No state shall make anything but gold and silver coin a
tender in payment of debts ...&quot; So why was gold coin illegal
for many years? Why aren`t Federal Reserve bank notes backed by
gold or silver?</p>

<p> Under the duties of the judicial branch, Article Three, it
says &quot;The trial of all crimes, except in cases of
impeachment, shall be by jury;...&quot; So why are we not
automatically given a trial by jury?</p>

<p> The constitution says the people shall have the right to keep
and bear arms. Now laws are being passed to abridge that right.</p>

<p> Article Six says &quot;The Constitution and the laws of the
United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof ... shall
be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state
shall be bound thereby ...&quot;. So why can we not use the
constitution in court as defense against violation of our rights?</p>

<p> The answer to all these questions is that the federal
government has used and abused the constitution's war and
emergency powers clause so that for over 60 years our
constitution has been suspended.</p>

<h1>The Report...</h1>
</center><center>

<p><img align="middle" src="../images/rwbbar.gif"></center></p>

<p> <b>NATIONAL EMERGENCY:</b> (as defined in Black's Law
Dictionary) A state of national crisis; a situation demanding
immediate and extraordinary national or federal action. Congress
has made little or no distinction between a &quot;state of
national emergenc y&quot; and a &quot;state of war&quot;. Brown
v. Bernstein, D.C.Pa., 49 F.Supp. 728, 732.</p>

<p> This report begins with a series of documents which are
representative (Exhibits 1 through 7), of the documents contained
in this Report. We will be quoting from in many cases, reports,
Senate and Congressional reports, hearings before National
Emergency Committees, Presidential Papers, Statutes at Large, and
the United States Code.</p>

<p> Exhibit 8 is taken from a book written by Swisher called
Constitutional Development. Let's read the first paragraph. It
says:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;We may well wonder in view of the precedents
            now established,&quot; said Charles E. Hughes,
            (Supreme Court Justice) in 1920, &quot;whether
            constitutional government as heretofore maintained in
            this Republic could survive another great war even
            victoriously waged.&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> How could that happen? Surely, if we go out and fight a war
and win it, we'd have to end up stronger than the day we started,
wouldn't we? Justice Hughes goes on to say:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;The conflict known as the World War had
            ended as far as military hostilities were concerned,
            but was not yet officially terminated. Most of the
            war statutes were still in effect, many of the
            emergency organizations were still in
            operation.&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> What is this man talking about when he speaks of &quot;war
statutes in effect and emergency organizations still in
operation&quot;?</p>

<p> In 1933 (Exhibit 9), Congressman Beck, speaking from the
Congressional Record, states:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;I think of all the damnable heresies that
            have ever been suggested in connection with the
            Constitution, the doctrine of emergency is the worst.
            it means that when Congress declares an emergency,
            there is no Constitution. This means its death. It is
            the very doctrine that the German chancellor is
            invoking today in the dying hours of the
            parliamentary body of the German republic, namely,
            that because of an emergency, it should grant to the
            German chancellor absolute power to pass any law,
            even though the law contradicts the Constitution of
            the German republic. Chancellor Hitler is at least
            frank about it. We pay the Constitution lipservice,
            but the result is the same.&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> Congressman Beck is saying that, of all the damnable heresies
that ever existed, this doctrine of emergency has got to be the
worst, because once Congress declares an emergency, there is no
Constitution. He goes on to say:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;But the Constitution of the United States,
            as a restraining influence in keeping the federal
            government within the carefully prescribed channels
            of power, is moribund, if not dead. We are witnessing
            its death-agonies, for when this bill becomes a law,
            if unhappily it becomes a law, there is no longer any
            workable Constitution to keep the Congress within the
            limits of its Constitutional powers.&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> What bill is Congressman Beck talking about? In 1933,
&quot;the House passed the Farm Bill by a vote of more than three
to one.&quot; Again, we see the doctrine of emergency. Once an
emergency is declared, there is no Constitution. The cause and
effect of the doctrine of emergency is the subject of this
Report. In 1973, in Senate Report 93-549 (Exhibit 10), the first
sentence reads: </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Since March the 9th, 1933, the United States
            has been in a state of declared national
            emergency.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Let's go back to Exhibit 9 just before this. What did that
say? It says that if a national emergency is declared, there is
no Constitution. Now, let us return to Exhibit 10. Since March
the 9th of 1933, the United States has been, in fact, in a state
of declared national emergency.</p>

<p> Referring to the middle of this exhibit:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;This vast range of powers, taken
            together, confer enough authority to rule the country
            without reference to normal constitutional processes.
            Under the powers delegated by these statutes, the
            President may: seize property; organize and control
            the means of production; seize commodities; assign
            military forces abroad; institute martial law; seize
            and control all transportation and communication;
            regulate the operation of private enterprise;
            restrict travel; and, in a plethora of particular
            ways, control the lives of all American
            citizens&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> and this situation has continued uninterrupted since March
the 9th of 1933.</p>

<p> In the introduction to Senate Report 93-549 (Exhibit 11):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;A majority of the people of the United
            States have lived all their lives under emergency
            rule.&quot; </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Remember, this report was produced in 1973. The introduction
goes on to say:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;For 40 years, freedoms and governmental
            procedures guaranteed by the Constitution have, in
            varying degrees, been abridged by laws brought into
            force by states of national emergency.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> The introduction continues:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;And, in the United States, actions taken
            by the government in times of great crisis have from,
            at least, the Civil War, in important ways shaped the
            present phenomenon of a permanent state of national
            emergency.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> How many people were taught that in school? How could it
possibly be that something which could suspend our Constitution
would not be taught in school? Amazing, isn't it?</p>

<p> Where does this (Exhibit 12) come from? Is it possible that,
in our Constitution, there could be some section which could
contemplate what these previous documents are referring to? In
Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution of the United States of
America, we find the following words:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;The privilege of the Writ of Habeas
            Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases
            of Rebellion or Invasion, the public Safety may
            require it.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Habeas Corpus - the Great Writ of Liberty. This is the writ
which guarantees that the government cannot charge us and hold us
with any crime, unless they follow the procedure of due process
of law. This writ also says, in effect, that the privilege of due
process of law cannot be suspended, and that the government
cannot not operate its arbitrary prerogative power against We the
People. But we see that the great Writ of Liberty can, in fact,
under the Constitution, be suspended when an invasion or a
rebellion necessitates it.</p>

<p> In the 5th Amendment to the Constitution (Exhibit 13), it
says:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;No person shall be held to answer for a
            capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a
            presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in
            cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the
            Militia, when in actual service in time of War or
            public danger...&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> We reserved the charging power for ourselves, didn't we? We
didn't give that power to the government. And we also said that
the government would be powerless to charge one of the citizens
or one of the peoples of the United States with a crime unless
We, the People, through our grand jury, orders it to do so
through an indictment or a presentment. And if We, the People,
don't order it, the government cannot do it. If it tried to do
it, we would simply follow the Writ of Habeas Corpus, and they
would have to release us, wouldn't they? They could not hold us.</p>

<p> But let us recall that, in Exhibit 13, it says:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;except in cases arising in the land or
            naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual
            service in times of War or public danger.&quot; </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> We can see here that the framers of the Constitution were
already contemplating times when there would be conditions under
which it might be necessary to suspend the guarantees of the
Constitution.</p>

<p> Also from Senate Report 93-549 (Exhibit 14), and remember
that our congressmen wrote these reports and these documents and
they're talking about these emergency powers and they say:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;They are quite careful and restrictive on
            the power, but the power to suspend is specifically
            contemplated by the Constitution in the Writ of
            Habeas Corpus.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Now, this is well known. This is not a concept that was not
known to rulers for many, many years. The concepts of
constitutional dictatorship went clear back to the Roman
Republic. And there, it was determined that, in times of dire
emergencies, yes, the constitution and the rights of the people
could be suspended, temporarily, until the crisis, whatever its
nature, could be resolved.</p>

<p> But once it was done, the Constitution was to be returned to
its peacetime position of authority. In France, the situation
under which the constitution could be suspended is called the
State of </p>

<p> Siege. In Great Britain, it's called the Defense of the Realm
Acts. In Germany, in which Hitler became a dictator, it was
simply called Article 48. In the United States, it is called the
War Powers.</p>

<p> If that was, in fact, the case, and we are under a war
emergency in this country, then there should be evidence of that
war emergency in the current law that exists today. That means we
should be able to go to the federal code known as the USC or
United States Code, and find that statute, that law, in
existence. And if we went to the library today and picked up a
copy of 12 USC and went to <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/12/95b.html">Section 95
(b)</a> (Exhibit 15), we will find a law which states:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;The actions, regulations, rules, licenses,
            orders and proclamations heretofore or hereafter
            taken, promulgated, made, or issued by the President
            of the United States or the Secretary of the Treasury
            since March the 4th, 1933, pursuant to the authority
            conferred by Subsection (b) of Section 5 of the Act
            of October 6th, 1917, as amended [12 USCS Sec. 95a],
            are hereby approved and confirmed. (Mar. 9, 1933, c.
            1, Title I, Sec. 1, 48 Stat. 1.)&quot;. </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> Now, what does this mean? It means that everything the
President or the Secretary of the Treasury has done since March
the 4th of 1933, or anything that the President or the Secretary
of the Treasury is hereafter going to do, is automatically
approved and confirmed. Referring back to Exhibit 10, let us
remember that, according to the Congressional Record of 1973, the
United States has been in a state of national emergency since
1933. Then we realize that 12 USC, <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/12/95b.html">Section 95
(b)</a> is current law. This is the law that exists over this
United States this moment.</p>

<p> If that be the case, let us see if we can understand what is
being said here. As every action, rule or law put into effect by
the President or the Secretary of the Treasury since March the
4th of 1933 has or will be confirmed and approved, let us
determine the significance of that date in history. What happened
on March the 4th of 1933?</p>

<p> On March the 4th of 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was
inaugurated as President of the United States. Referring to his
inaugural address, which was given at a time when the country was
in the throes of the Great Depression, we read (Exhibit 16):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;I am prepared under my constitutional duty
            to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in
            the midst of a stricken world may require. These
            measures, or such other measures as the Congress may
            build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall seek,
            within my constitutional authority, to bring to
            speedy adoption. But in the event that the Congress
            shall fall to take one of these two courses, and in
            the event that the national emergency is still
            critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty
            that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress
            for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis
            broad Executive power to wage a war against the
            emergency, as great as the power that would be given
            to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign
            foe.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>

<p> On March the 4th, 1933, at his inaugural, President Roosevelt
was saying that he was going to ask Congress for the
extraordinary authority available to him under the War Powers
Act. Let's see if he got it.</p>

<p> On March the 5th, President Roosevelt asked for a special and
extraordinary session of Congress in Proclamation 2038. He called
for the special session of Congress to meet on March the 9th at
noon. And at that Congress, he presented a bill, an Act, to
provide for relief in the existing national emergency in banking
and for other purposes.</p>

<p> In the enabling portion of that Act (Exhibit 17), it states:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of
            Representatives of the United States of America in
            Congress assembled, That the Congress hereby declares
            that a serious emergency exists and that it is
            imperatively necessary speedily to put into effect
            remedies of uniform national application.&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> What is the concept of the rule of necessity, referred to in
the enabling portion of the act as &quot;imperatively necessary
speedily&quot;? The rule of necessity is a rule of law which
states that necessity knows no law. A good example of the rule of
necessity would be the concept of self-defense. The law says,
&quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;. But also know that, if you are
in dire danger, in danger of losing your life, then you have the
absolute right of self-defense. You have the right to kill to
protect your own life. That is the ultimate rule of necessity.</p>

<p> Thus we see that the rule of necessity overrides all other
law, and, in fact, allows one to do that which would normally be
against the law. So it is reasonable to assume that the wording
of the enabling portion of the Act of March 9, 1933, is an
indication that what follows is something which will probably be
against the law. It will probably be against the Constitution of
the United States, or it would not require that the rule of
necessity be invoked to enact it.</p>

<p> In the Act of March 9, 1933 (Exhibit 17), it further states
in Title 1, Section 1:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;The actions, regulations, rules, licenses,
            orders and proclamations heretofore or hereafter
            taken, promulgated, made, or issued by the President
            of the United States or the Secretary of the Treasury
            since March the 4th, 1933, pursuant to the authority
            conferred by subdivision (b) of Section 5 of the Act
            of October 6, 1917, as amended, are hereby approved
            and confirmed.&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> Where have we read those words before?</p>

<p> This is the exact same wording as is found (Exhibit 15) today
in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/12/95b.html">Title
12, USC 95 (b).</a> The language in <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/12/95b.html">Title 12,
USC 95 (b)</a> is exactly the same as that found in the Act of
March 9, 1933, Chapter 1, Title 1, Section 48, Statute 1. The Act
of March 9, 1933, is still in full force and effect today. We are
still under the Rule of Necessity. We are still in a declared
state of national emergency, a state of emergency which has
existed, uninterrupted, since 1933, or for over sixty years.</p>

<p> As you may remember, the authority to do this is conferred by
Subsection (b) of Section 5 of the Act of October 6, 1917, as
amended. What was the authority which was used to declare and
enact the emergency in this Act? If we look at the Act of October
6, 1917 (Exhibit 18), we see that at the top right-hand part of
the page, it states that this was:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;An Act To define, regulate, and punish
            trading with the enemy, and for other purposes.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>
</i>

<p> By the year 1917, the United States was involved in World War
1; at that point, it was recognized that there were probably
enemies of the United States, or allies of enemies of the United
States, living within the continental borders of our nation in a
time of war.</p>

<p> Therefore, Congress passed this act which identified who
could be declared enemies of the United States, and, in this act,
we gave the government total authority over those enemies to do
with as it saw fit. We also see, however, in Section 2,
Subdivision (c) in the middle, and again at the bottom of the
page:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;other than citizens of the United
            States.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> The act specifically excluded citizens of the United States,
because we realized in 1917 that the citizens of the United
States were not enemies. Thus, we were excluded from the war
powers over enemies in this act.</p>

<p> Section 5 (b) of the same act (Exhibit 19), states:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;That the President may investigate,
            regulate, or prohibit, under such rules and
            regulations as he may prescribe, by means of licenses
            or otherwise, any transactions in foreign exchange,
            export or earmarkings of gold or silver coin or
            bullion or currency, transfers of credit in any form
            (other than credits relating solely to transactions
            to be executed wholly within the United
            States)&quot;. </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> Again, we see here that citizens, and the transactions of
citizens made wholly within the United States, were specifically
excluded from the war powers of this act. &quot;We the
People&quot;, were not enemies of our country; therefore, the
government did not have total authority over us as they were
given over our enemies.</p>

<p> It is important to draw attention again to the fact that
citizens of the United States in October, 1917, were not called
enemies. Consequently the government, under the war powers of
this act, did not have authority over us; we were still protected
by the Constitution. Granted, over enemies of this nation, the
government was empowered to do anything it deemed necessary, but
not over us. The distinction made between enemies of the United
States and citizens of the United States will become crucial
later on.</p>

<p> In Section 2 of the Act of March 9, 1933 (Exhibit 17),</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Subdivision (b) of Section 5 of the Act of
            October 6, 1917 (40 Stat. L. 411), as amended, is
            hereby amended to read as follows;&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> So we see that they are now going to amend Section 5 (b). Now
let's see how it reads after it's amended. The amended version of
Section 5 (b) reads (emphasis added):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;During time of war or during any other
            period of national emergency declared by the
            President, the President may, through any agency that
            be may designate, or otherwise, investigate,
            regulate, or prohibit, under such rules and
            regulations as be may prescribe, by means of licenses
            or otherwise, any transactions in foreign exchange,
            transfers of credit between or payments by banking
            institutions as defined by the President and export,
            hoarding, melting, or earmarkings of gold or silver
            coin or bullion or currency, by any person within the
            United States or anyplace subject to the jurisdiction
            thereof&quot;. </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> What just happened? At as far as commercial, monetary or
business transactions were concerned, the people of the United
States were no longer differentiated from any other enemy of the
United States. We had lost that crucial distinction. Comparing
Exhibit 17 with Exhibit 19, we can see that the phrase which
excluded transactions executed wholly within the United States
has been removed from the amended version of Section 5 (b) of the
Act of March 9, 1933, Section 2, and replaced with &quot;by any
person within the United States or anyplace subject to the
jurisdiction thereof'. All monetary transactions, whether
domestic or international in scope, were now placed at the whim
of the President of the United States through the authority given
to him by the Trading with the Enemy Act.</p>

<p> To summarize this critical point: On October the 6th of 1917,
at the beginning of America's involvement in World War 1,
Congress passed a Trading with the Enemy Act empowering the
government to take control over any and all commercial, monetary
or business transactions conducted by enemies or allies of
enemies within our continental borders. That act also defined the
term &quot;enemy&quot; and excluded from that definition citizens
of the United States.</p>

<p> In Section 5 (b) of this act, we see that the President was
given unlimited authority to control the commercial transactions
of defined enemies, but we see that credits relating solely to
transactions executed wholly within the United States were
excluded from that controlling authority. As transactions wholly
domestic in nature were excluded from authority, the government
had no extraordinary control over the daily business conducted by
the citizens of the United States, because we were certainly not
enemies.</p>

<p> Citizens of the United States were not enemies of their
country in 1917, and the transactions conducted by citizens
within this country were not considered to be enemy transactions.
But in looking again at Section 2 of the Act of March 9, 1933,
(Exhibit 17), we can see that the phrase excluding wholly
domestic transactions has been removed from the amended version
and replaced with &quot;by any person within the United States or
anyplace subject to the jurisdiction thereof'.</p>

<p> The people of the United States were now subject to the power
of the Trading with the Enemy Act of October 6,1917, as amended.
For the purposes of all commercial, monetary, and, in effect, all
business transactions. &quot;We the People&quot;, became the same
as the enemy, and were treated no differently. There was no
longer any distinction.</p>

<p> It is important here to note that, in the Acts of October 6,
1917 and March 9, 1933, it states: &quot;during times of war or
during any other national emergency declared by the
President...&quot;. So we now see that the war powers not only
included a period of war, but also a period of &quot;national
emergency&quot; as defined by the President of the United States.
When either of these two situations occur, the President may,
(Exhibit 17)</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;through any agency that he may designate, or
            otherwise, investigate, regulate or prohibit under
            such rules and regulations as he may prescribe by
            means of licenses or otherwise, any transactions in
            foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or
            payments by banking institutions as defined by the
            President and export, boarding, melting or earmarking
            of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency by any
            person within the United States or anyplace subject
            to the jurisdiction thereof.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> What can the President do now to the We, the People, under
this Section? He can do anything he wants to do. It's purely at
his discretion, and he can use any agency or any license that he
desires to control it. This is called a constitutional
dictatorship.</p>

<p> In Senate Document 93-549 (Exhibit 20), Congress declared
that a serious emergency exists, at:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;48 Stat. 1. The exclusion of domestic
            transactions, formerly found in the Act, was deleted
            from Sect. 5 (b) at this time.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> Our Congress wrote that in the year 1973.</p>

<p> Now let's find out about the Trading with the Enemy Act of
October 6, 1917. Quoting from a Supreme Court decision (Exhibit
21), Stoehr v. Wallace, 1921:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;The Trading With the Enemy Act, originally
            and as amended, is strictly a war measure, and finds
            its sanction in the provision empowering Congress
            &quot;to declare war, grant letters of marque and
            reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land
            and water&quot; Const. Art. 1, Sect. 8, c1. 11.
            P.241&quot;. </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> Remember your Constitution? &quot;Congress shall have the
power to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal and
make all rules concerning the captures on the land and the water
of the enemies,&quot; all rules.</p>

<p> If that be the case, let us look at the memorandum of law
that now covers trading with the enemy, the &quot;Memorandum of
American Cases and Recent English Cases on The Law of Trading
With the Enemy&quot; (Exhibit 22), remembering that we are now
the same as the enemy. In this memorandum, we read:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Every species of intercourse with the enemy
            is illegal. This prohibition is not limited to mere
            commercial intercourse.&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> This is the case of <i>The Rapid</i> (1814).</p>

<p> Additionally,</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;No contract is considered as valid between
            enemies, at least so far as to give them a remedy in
            the courts of either government, and they have, in
            the language of the civil law, no ability to sustain
            a persona standi in judicio&quot;. </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> In other words, they have no personal lights at law in court.
This is the case of The Julia (1813).</p>

<p> In the next case, the case of The Sally (1814) (Exhibit 23),
we read the words:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;By the general law of prize, property
            engaged in an illegal intercourse with the enemy is
            deemed enemy property. It is of no consequence
            whether it belong to an ally or to a citizen; the
            illegal traffic stamps it with the hostile character,
            and attaches to it all the penal consequences of
            enemy ownership&quot;. </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Reading further in the memorandum, again from the case of <i>The
Rapid:</i></p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;The law of prize is part of the law of
            nations. In it, a hostile character is attached to
            trade, independently of the character of the trader
            who pursues or directs it. Condemnation to the use of
            the captor is equally the fate of the property of the
            belligerent and of the property found engaged in
            anti-neutral trade. But a citizen or an ally may be
            engaged in a hostile trade, and thereby involve his
            property in the fate of those in whose cause he
            embarks&quot;.</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> Again from the memorandum (Exhibit 24):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;The produce of the soil of the hostile
            territory, as well as other property engaged in the
            commerce of the hostile power, as the source of its
            wealth and strength, are always regarded as
            legitimate prize, without regard to the domicile of
            the owner&quot;.</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> From the case (Exhibit 25) of <i>The William Bagaley</i>
(1866):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;In general, during war, contracts with, or
            powers of attorney or agency from, the enemy executed
            after outbreak of war are illegal and void; contracts
            entered into with the enemy prior to the war are
            either suspended or are absolutely terminated;
            partnerships with an enemy are dissolved; powers of
            attorney from the enemy, with certain exceptions,
            lapse; payments to the enemy (except to agents in the
            United States appointed prior to the war and
            confirmed since the war) are illegal and void; all
            rights of an enemy to sue in the courts are
            suspended.&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> From Senate Report No. 113 (Exhibit 26), in which we find An
Act to Define, Regulate, and Punish Trading with the Enemy, and
For Other Purposes, we read:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;The trade or commerce regulated or
            prohibited is defined in Subsections (a), (b), (c),
            (d) and (e), page 4. This trade covers almost every
            imaginable transaction, and is forbidden and made
            unlawful except when allowed under the form of
            licenses issued by the Secretary of Commerce (p. 4,
            sec. 3, line 18). This authorization of trading under
            licenses constitutes the principal modification of
            the rule of international law forbidding trade
            between the citizens of belligerents, for the power
            to grant such licenses, and therefore exemption from
            the operation of law, is given by the bill.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> It says no trade can be conducted or no intercourse can be
conducted without a license, because, by mere definition of the
enemy, and under the prize law, all intercourse is illegal.</p>

<p> That was the first case we looked at, Exhibit 22, wasn't it?
So once we were declared enemies, all intercourse became illegal
for us. The only way we could now do business or any type of
legal intercourse was to obtain permission from our government by
means of a license. We are certainly required to have a Social
Security Card, which is a license to work, and a Drivers License,
which gives the government the ability to restrict travel; all
business in which we engage ourselves requires us to have a
license, does it not?</p>

<p> Returning once again to the Memorandum of Law: (Exhibit 27)</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;But it is necessary always to bear in mind
            that a war cannot be carried on without hurting
            somebody, even, at times, our own citizens. The
            public good, however, must prevail over private gain.
            As we said in Bishop v. Jones (28 Texas, 294), there
            cannot be &quot;a war for arms and a peace for
            commerce&quot;. One of the most important features of
            the bill is that which provides for the temporary
            taking over of the enemy property.&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> This point of law is important to keep in mind, for it
authorizes the temporary takeover of enemy property. The question
is: Once the war terminates, the property must be returned,
mustn't it?</p>

<p> The property that is confiscated, and the belligerent night
of the government during the period of war, must be returned when
the war terminates. Let us take the case of a ship in harbor; war
breaks out, and the Admiral says,<i> &quot;I'm seizing your
ship.&quot;</i> Can you stop him? No. But when the war is over,
the Admiral must return your ship to you. This point is important
to bear in mind, for we will return to, and expand upon, it later
in the report.</p>

<p> Reading from (Exhibit 28) Senate Document No. 43,
&quot;Contracts Payable in Gold&quot; written in 1933:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;The ultimate ownership of all property is in
            the State; individual so-called &quot;ownership&quot;
            is only by virtue of government, i. e., law,
            amounting to mere user; and use must be in accordance
            with law and subordinate to the necessities of the
            State.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> Who owns all the property? Who owns the property you call
&quot;yours&quot;? Who has the authority to mortgage property?
Let us continue with a Supreme Court decision, (Exhibit 29) <i>United
States v. Russell:</i></p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Private property, the Constitution provides,
            shall not be taken for public use without just
            compensation...&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>
</i>

<p> That is the peacetime clause, isn't it? Further (emphasis
added),</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Extraordinary and unforeseen occasions
            arise, however, beyond all doubt, in cases of extreme
            necessity in time of war or of immediate and
            impending public danger, in which private property
            may be impressed into the public service, or may be
            seized or appropriated to public use, or may even be
            destroyed without the consent of the owner...&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> This quote, and indeed this case, provides a vivid
frustration of the potential power of the government.</p>

<p> Now, let us return to the period of time after March 4, 1933,
and take a close look at what really occurred. On March 4, 1933,
in his inaugural address, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt
asked for the authority of the war powers, and called a special
session of Congress for the purpose of having those powers
conferred to him.</p>

<p> On March the 2nd, 1933, however, we find that Herbert Hoover
had written a letter to the Federal Reserve Board of New York,
asking them for recommendations for action based on the over-all
situation at the time. The Federal Reserve Board responded with a
resolution (Exhibit 30) which they had adopted, an excerpt from
which follows:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Resolution Adopted By The Federal Reserve
            Board Of New York. Whereas, in the opinion of the
            Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
            York, the continued and increasing withdrawal of
            currency and gold from the banks of the country has
            now created a national emergency ...&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> In order to fully appreciate the significance of this last
quote, we must recall that, in 1913, The Federal Reserve Act was
passed, authorizing the creation of a central bank, the thought
of which had already been noted in the Constitution. The basic
idea of the central bank was, among other things, for it to act
as a secure repository for the gold of the people. We, the
People, would bring our gold to the huge, strong vaults of the
Federal Reserve, and we would be issued a note which said, in
effect, that, at any time we desired, we could bring that note
back to the bank and be given back our gold which we had
deposited.</p>

<p> Until 1933, that agreement, that contract between the Federal
Reserve and its depositors, was honored. Federal Reserve notes,
prior to 1933, were indeed redeemable in gold. After 1933, the
situation changed drastically. In 1933, during the depths of the
Depression, at the time when We, the People, were struggling to
stay alive and keep our families fed, the bankers began to say:
&quot;People are coming in now, wanting their gold, wanting us to
honor this contract we have made with them to give them their
gold on demand, and this contractual obligation is creating a
national emergency.&quot;</p>

<p> How could that happen? Reading from the Public Papers of
Herbert Hoover (Exhibit 31):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, that, in
            this emergency, the Federal Reserve Board is hereby
            requested to urge the President of the United States
            to declare a bank holiday, Saturday, March 4, and
            Monday, March 6.</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> In other words, President Roosevelt was urged to close down
the banking system and make it unavailable make it unavailable
for a short period of time. What was to happen during that period
of time?</p>

<p> Reading again from the Federal Reserve Board resolution
(Exhibit 31), we find a proposal for an executive order, to be
worded as follows:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Whereas, it is provided in Section 5 (b)
            of the Act of October 6, 1917, as amended, that
            &quot;the President may investigate, regulate, or
            prohibit, under such rules and regulations as he may
            prescribe, by means of licenses or otherwise, any
            transactions in foreign exchange and the export,
            hoarding, melting, or earmarkings of gold or silver
            coin or bullion or currency, *** &quot;</i> </p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Now, in any normal usage of the American language, the
standard accepted meaning of a series of three asterisks after a
quotation means that what follows also must be quoted exactly,
doesn't it? If it's not, that's a fraudulent use of the American
language. At that point where that, *** &quot; began, what did
the original Act of October 6, 1917, say?</p>

<p> Referring back to Exhibit 19, we find that the remainder of
Section 5 (b) of the Act of October 6, 1917 says:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;(other than credits relating solely to
            transactions to be executed wholly within the United
            States).&quot; </i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p></p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>This portion of Section 5 (b) specifically prohibited the
government from taking control of We, the People's money and
transactions, didn't it?</p>

<p> However, let us now read the remainder of Section 5 (b) of
the Act of October 6, 1917, as amended on March 9, 1933 (Exhibit
17):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;by any person within the United States or
            any place subject to the Jurisdiction thereof.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>Comparing the original with the amended version of Section 5
(b), we can see the full significance of the amended version,
wherein the exclusion of domestic transactions from the powers of
the Act was deleted, and &quot;any person&quot; became subject to
the extraordinary powers conferred by the act. Further, we can
now see that the usage of *** &quot; was, in all to likelihood,
meant be deliberately misleading, if not fraudulent in nature.</p>

<p> Further, in the next section of the Federal Reserve Board's
proposal, we find that anyone violating any provision of this act
will be fined not more than $10,000.00, or imprisoned for not
more than ten years, or both. A severe enough penalty at any
time, but one made all the more harsh by the economic conditions
in which most Americans found themselves at the time. And where
were these alterations and amendments to be found? Not from the
government itself, initially; no, they are first to be found in a
proposal from the Federal Reserve Board of New York, a banking
institution.</p>

<p> Let us recall the chronology of events: Herbert Hoover, in
his last days as President of the United States, asked for a
recommendation from the Federal Reserve Board of New York, and
they responded with their proposals. We see that President Hoover
did not act on the recommendation, and believed the actions were
&quot;neither justified nor necessary&quot; (Appendix, Public
Papers of Herbert Hoover, p. 1088) . Let us see what happened;
remember on March 4, 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was
inaugurated as President of the United States. On March 5, 1933,
President Roosevelt called for an extraordinary session of
Congress to be held on March 9,1933, as can be seen in Exhibit
32:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Whereas, public interests require that
            the Congress of the United States should be convened
            in extra session at twelve o'clock, noon, on the
            Ninth day of March, 1933, to receive such
            communication as may be made by the Executive.&quot; </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> On the next day, March 6, 1933, President Roosevelt issued
Proclamation 2039, which has been included in this report,
starting at the bottom of Exhibit 32. In Exhibit 32, we find the
following:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Whereas there have been heavy and
            unwarranted withdrawals of gold and currency from our
            banking institutions for the purpose of
            hoarding&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> Right at the beginning, we have a problem. And the problem
rests in the question of who should be the judge of whether or
not my gold, on deposit at the Federal Reserve, with which I have
a contract which says, in effect, that I may withdraw my gold at
my discretion, is being withdrawn by me in an
&quot;unwarranted&quot; manner. Remember, the people of the
United States were in dire economic straits at this point. If I
had gold at the Federal Reserve, I would consider withdrawing as
much of my gold as I needed for my family and myself a
&quot;warranted&quot; action. But the decision was not left up to
We, the People.</p>

<p> It is also important to note that it is stated that the gold
is being withdrawn for the purpose of &quot;hoarding&quot;. The
significance of this phrase becomes clearer when we reach
Proclamation 2039, wherein the term &quot;hoarding&quot; is
inserted into the amended version of Section 5(b). The term,
&quot;hoarding&quot;, was not to be found in the original version
of Section 5(b) of the Act of October 6, 1917. It was a term
which was used by President Roosevelt to help support his
contention that the United States was in the middle of a national
emergency, and his assertion that the extraordinary powers
conferred to him by the War Powers Act were needed to deal with
that emergency.</p>

<p> Let us now go on to the middle of Proclamation 2039, at the
top of the next page, Exhibit 33. In reading from Exhibit 33, we
find the following:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Whereas, it is provided in Section 5 (b)
            of the Act of October 6, 1917, (40 Stat. L. 411) as
            amended, &quot; that the President may investigate,
            regulate, or prohibit, under such rules and
            regulations as he may prescribe, by means of licenses
            or otherwise, any transaction in foreign exchange and
            the export, hoarding, melting, or earmarkings of gold
            or silver coin or bullion or currency * * * &quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> exactly as was first proposed by the Federal Reserve Board of
New York (Exhibit 31).</p>

<p> If we return to 48 Statute 1 (Exhibit 17), Title 1, Section
1, we find that the amended Section 5 (b) with its added phrase:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;by any person within the United States or
            any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof&quot;. </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Is this becoming clearer as to exactly what happened? On
March 5, 1933, President Roosevelt called for an extra session of
Congress, and on March 6, 1933, issued Proclamation 2039
(Exhibits 32-33). On March 9th, Roosevelt issued Proclamation
2040. We looked at Proclamation 2039 on Exhibits 32 and 33, and
now, on Exhibit 33 (a), let's see what Roosevelt is hiking about
in Proclamation 2040:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Whereas, on March 6, 1933, I, Franklin D.
            Roosevelt, President of the United States of America,
            by Proclamation declared the existence of a national
            emergency and proclaimed a bank holiday... &quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> We see that Roosevelt declared a national emergency and a
bank holiday. Let's read on:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Whereas, under the Act of March 9, 1933,
            all Proclamations heretofore or hereafter issued by
            the President pursuant to the authority conferred by
            section 5 (b) of the Act of October 6, 1917, as
            amended, are approved and confirmed;&quot; </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> This section of the Proclamation clearly states that all
proclamations heretofore or hereafter issued by the President are
approved and confirmed, citing the authority of Section 5 (b).
The key words here being<i> &quot;all&quot;</i> and<i>
&quot;approved&quot;</i>. Further:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Whereas, said national emergency still
            continues, and it is necessary to take further
            measures extending beyond March 9, 1933, in order to
            accomplish such purposes&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> We again clearly see that there is more to come, evidenced by
the phrase, &quot;further measures extending beyond March 9, 1933
...&quot;. Could this be the beginning of a new deal? Possibly a
one-sided deal. How long can this type of action continue? Let's
find out.</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Now, therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
            President of the United States of America, in view of
            such continuing national emergency and by virtue of
            the authority vested in me by Section 5 (b) of the
            Act of October 6, 1917 (40 Stat. L. 411) as amended
            by the Act of March 9, 1933, do hereby proclaim,
            order, direct and declare that all the terms and
            provisions of said Proclamation of March 6, 1933, and
            the regulations and orders issued thereunder are
            hereby continued in full force and effect until
            further proclamation by the President.&quot;</i> </p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> We now understand that the Proclamation 2039, of March 6,
1933 and Proclamation 2040 of March 9, 1933, will continue until
such time as another proclamation is made by &quot;the
President&quot;. Note that the term &quot;the President&quot; is
not specific to President Roosevelt; it is a generic term which
can equally apply to any President from Roosevelt to the present,
and beyond.</p>

<p> So here we have President Roosevelt declaring a national
emergency (we are now beginning to realize the full significance
of those words) and closing the national banks for two days, by
Executive Order. Further, he states that the Proclamations
bringing about these actions will continue <i>&quot;in full force
and effect&quot;</i> until such time as the President, and only
the President, changes the situation.</p>

<p> It is important to note the fact that these Proclamations
were made on March 6, 1933, three days before Congress was due to
convene its extra session. Yet references are made to such things
as the amended Section 5 (b), which had not yet even been
confirmed by Congress. President Roosevelt must have been
supremely confident of Congress' confirmation of his actions. And
indeed, we find that confidence was justified. For on March 9,
1933, without individual Congressmen even having the opportunity
to read for themselves the bill they were to confirm, Congress
did indeed approve the amendment of Section 5 (b) of the Act of
October 6, 1917.</p>

<p> Referring to the Public Papers of Herbert Hoover (Exhibit
34):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;That those speculators and insiders were
            right was plain enough later on. This first contract
            of the 'moneychangers' with the New Deal netted those
            who removed their money from the country a profit of
            up to 60 percent when the dollar was debased.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> Where had our gold gone? Our gold had already been moved
offshore. The gold was not in the banks, and when We, the People
lined up at the door attempting to have our contracts honored,
the deception was exposed. What happened then? The laws were
changed to prevent us from asking again, and the military was
brought in to protect the Federal Reserve. We, the People, were
declared to be, the same as public enemy and placed under
military authority.</p>

<p> Going now to another section of 48 Statute 1 (Exhibit 35):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Whenever in the judgment of the Secretary of
            the Treasury, such action is necessary to protect the
            currency system of the United States, the Secretary
            of the Treasury, in his discretion, may require any
            or all individuals, partnerships, associations and
            corporations to pay and deliver to the Treasurer of
            the United States any or all gold coin, gold bullion,
            and gold certificates owned by such individuals,
            partnerships, associations and corporations.&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> By this Statute, everyone was required to turn in their gold.
Failure to do so would constitute a violation of this provision,
such violation to be punishable by a fine of not more than
$10,000.00 and imprisonment for not more than ten years. It was a
seizure. Whose property may be seized without due process of law
under the Trading With the Enemy Act? The enemy's. Whose gold was
seized? Ours - the gold of the people of the United States.</p>

<p> From the Roosevelt Papers (Exhibit 36):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;During this banking holiday it was at
            first believed that some form of scrip or emergency
            currency would be necessary for the conduct of
            ordinary business. We knew that it would be essential
            when the banks reopened to have an adequate supply of
            currency to meet all possible demands of depositors.
            Consideration was given by government officials and
            various government officials and various local
            agencies to the advisability of issuing clearinghouse
            certificates or some similar form of local emergency
            currency. On March 7, 1933, the Secretary of the
            Treasury issued a regulation authorizing clearing
            houses to issue demand certificates against sound
            assets of the banking institutions, but this
            authority was not to become effective until March
            10th. In many cities, the printing of these
            certificates was actually begun, but after the
            passage of the Emergency Banking Relief Act of March
            9, 1933 (48 Stat. 1), it became evident that they
            would not be needed, because the Act made possible
            the issue of the necessary amount of emergency
            currency in the form of Federal Reserve banknotes
            which could be based on any sound assets owned by
            banks.&quot;</i> </p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Roosevelt could now issue emergency currency under the Act of
March 9, 1933 and this currency was to be called Federal Reserve
bank notes. From Title 4 of the Act of March 9, 1933 (Exhibit
37):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Upon the deposit with the Treasurer of
            the United States, (a) of any direct obligations of
            the United States or (b) of any notes, drafts, bills
            of exchange, or bankers' acceptances acquired under
            the provisions of this act, any Federal reserve bank
            making such deposit in the manner prescribed by the
            Secretary of the Treasury shall be entitled to
            receive from the Comptroller of the currency
            circulating notes in blank, duly registered and
            countersigned.&quot;</i> </p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> What is this saying? It says (emphasis added): &quot;Upon the
deposit with the Treasurer of the United States, (a) of any
direct obligation of the United States ...&quot; What is a direct
obligation of the United States? It's a treasury note, which is
an obligation upon whom? Upon &quot;We the People&quot; to
perform. It's a taxpayer obligation, isn't it?</p>

<p> Title 4 goes on: &quot;or (b) of my notes, drafts, bills of
exchange or bankers' acceptances...&quot; What's a note? If you
go to the bank and sign a note on your home, that's a note, isn't
it? A note is a private obligation upon We, the People. And if
the Federal Reserve Bank deposits either (a) public and/or (b)
private obligation of We, the People, with the Treasury, the
Comptroller of the currency will issue this circulating note
endorsed in blank, duly registered and countersigned, an
emergency currency based on the (a) public and/or (b) private
obligations of the people of the United States.</p>

<p> In the Congressional Record of March 9, 1933 (Exhibit 38), we
find evidence that our congressmen didn't even have individual
copies of the bill to read, on which they were about to vote. A
copy of the bill was passed around for approximately 40 minutes.</p>

<p> Congressman McFadden made the comment,</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Mr. Speaker, I regret that the membership
            of the House has had no opportunity to consider or
            even read this bill. The first opportunity I had to
            know what this legislation is, was when it was read
            from the clerk's desk. It is an important banking
            bill. It is a dictatorship over finance in the United
            States. It is complete control over the banking
            system in the United States ... It is difficult under
            the circumstances to discuss this bill. The first
            section of the bill, as I grasped it, is practically
            the war powers that were given back in 1917.&quot;</i> </p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Congressman McFadden later says,</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;I would like to ask the chairman of the
            committee if this is a plan to change the holding of
            the security back of the Federal Reserve notes to the
            Treasury of the United States rather than the Federal
            Reserve agent.&quot; </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Keep in mind, here, that, prior to 1933, the Federal Reserve
bank held our gold as security, in return for Federal Reserve
gold notes which we could redeem at any time we wanted. Now,
however, Congressman McFadden is asking if this proposed bill is
a plan to change who's going to hold the security, from the
Federal Reserve to the Treasury.</p>

<p> Chairman Steagall's response to Congressman McFadden's
question, again from the Congressional Record:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;This provision is for the issuance of
            Federal Reserve bank notes; and not for Federal
            Reserve notes; and the security back of it is the
            obligations, notes, drafts, bills of exchange, bank
            acceptances, outlined in the section to which the
            gentleman has referred.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> We were backed by gold, and our gold was seized, wasn't it?
We were penniless, and now our money would be secured, not by
gold, but by notes and obligations on which We, the People, were
the collateral security.</p>

<p> Congressman McFadden then questioned,</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Then the new circulation is to be Federal
            Reserve bank notes and not Federal Reserve notes. Is
            that true?&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> Mr. Steagall replied,</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Insofar as the provisions of this section
            are concerned, yes.&quot;</i> </p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Does that sound familiar?</p>

<p> Next we hear from Congressman Britten, as noted in the
Congressional Record (Exhibit 39):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;From my observations of the bill as it
            was read to the House, it would appear that the
            amount of bank notes that might be issued by the
            Federal Reserve System is not limited. That will
            depend entirely upon the amount of collateral that is

<p> Who is the collateral? We are chattel, aren't we? We have no

<p> It now is no wonder that credit became so available after the

our obligations, our homes, our jobs... we were now slaves for
the system.</p>

<p> From Statutes at Large, in the Congressional Record (Exhibit

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;When required to do so by the Secretary
            of the Treasury, each Federal Reserve agent shall act

            performance of any functions which the Treasurer or

        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> The Federal Reserve was taken over by the Treasury. The
Treasury holds the assets. We are the collateral... ourselves and
our property.</p>

<p> To summarize briefly: On March 9, 1933 the American people in
all their domestic, daily, and commercial transactions became the
same as the enemy. The President of the United States, through
licenses or any other form, was given the power to regulate and
control the actions of enemies. He made We, the People, chattel
property; he seized our gold, our property and our rights; and he
suspended the Constitution. And we know that current law, to this
day, says that all proclamations issued heretofore or hereafter
by the President or the Secretary of the Treasury are approved
and confirmed by Congress. Pretty broad, sweeping approval to be
automatic, wouldn't you agree?</p>

<p> On March 11, 1933, President Roosevelt, in his first radio
&quot;Fireside Chat&quot; (Exhibit 42), makes the following
statement:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;The Secretary of the Treasury will issue
            licenses to banks which are members of the Federal
            Reserve system, whether national bank or state,
            located in each of the 12 Federal Reserve bank
            cities, to open Monday morning.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        </i></dd>
</dl>

<p> It was by this action that the Treasury took over the banking
system.</p>

<p> Black's Law Dictionary defines the Bank Holiday of 1933
(Exhibit 42a) in the following words:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Presidential Proclamations No. 2039,
            issued March 6, 1933, and No. 2040, issued March 9,
            1933, temporarily suspended banking transactions by
            member banks of the Federal Reserve System. Normal
            banking functions were resumed on March 13, subject
            to certain restrictions. The first proclamation, it
            was held, had no authority in law until the passage
            on March 9, 1933, of a ratifying act (12 U.S.C.A.
            Sect. <a
            href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/12/95b.html">95b</a>).

<p> Take special note of the last sentence of this definition,
especially the phrase, <i>&quot;present law&quot;</i>. The fact
that banks are under regulation of the Treasury today, is
evidence that the state of emergency still exists, by virtue of
the definition. Not that, at this point, we need any more
evidence to prove we are still in a declared state of national
emergency.</p>

<p> From the Agricultural Adjustment Act of May 12, 1933 (Exhibit
43):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;To issue licenses permitting processors,
            associations of producers and others to engage in the
            handling, in the current of interstate or foreign
            commerce, of any agricultural commodity or product
            thereof.&quot; </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> This is the seizure of the agricultural industry by means of
licensing authority.</p>

<p> In the first hundred days of the reign of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, similar seizures by licensing authority were
successfully completed by the government over a plethora of other
industries, among them transportation, communications, public
utilities, securities, oil, labor, and all natural resources. The
first hundred days of FDR saw the nationalization of the United
States, its people and its assets. What has Bill Clinton talked
about during his campaign and early presidency? His first hundred
days.</p>

<p> Now, we know that they took over all contracts, for we have
already read in Exhibit 22:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;No contract is considered as valid as
            between enemies, at least so far as to give them a
            remedy in the courts of law of either government, and
            they have, in the language of civil law, no ability
            to sustain a persona standi in judicio.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> They have no personal nights at law. Therefore, we should
expect that we would see in the statutes a time when the contract
between the, Federal Reserve and We, the People, in which the
Federal Reserve had to give us our gold on demand, was made null
and void.</p>

<p> Referring to House Joint Resolution 192 (June 5, 1933)
(Exhibit 44):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;That (a) every provision contained in or
            made with respect to any obligation which purports to

            amount of money of the United States measured thereby
            is declared to be against public policy; and no such
            policy shall be contained in or made with respect to
            any obligation hereafter incurred.&quot; </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Indeed, our contract with the Federal Reserve was invalidated
at the end of Roosevelt's hundred days. We lost our night to
require our gold back from the bank in which we had deposited it.</p>

<p> Returning once again to the Roosevelt Papers (Exhibit 45):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;This conference of fifty farm leaders met
            on March 10, 1933. They agreed on recommendations for
            a bill, which were presented to me at the White House
            on March 11th by a committee of the conference, who
            requested me to call upon the Congress for the same
            broad powers to meet the emergency in agriculture as
            I had requested for solving the bank crisis.&quot;</i> </p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> What was the &quot;broad powers&quot;? That was the War
Powers, wasn't it? And now we see the farm leaders asking
President Roosevelt to use the same War Powers to take control of
the agricultural industry. Well, needless to say, he did. We
should wonder about all that took place at this conference, for
it to result in the eventual acquiescence of farm leadership to
the governmental takeover of their livelihoods.</p>

<p> Reading from the Agricultural Adjustment Act, May the 12th,
Declaration of Emergency (Exhibit 46):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;That the present acute economic emergency
            being in part the consequence of a severe and
            increasing disparity between the prices of
            agriculture and other commodities, which disparity
            bas largely destroyed the purchasing power of farmers
            for industrial products, has broken down the orderly
            exchange of commodities, and has seriously impaired
            the agricultural assets supporting the national
            credit structure, it is hereby declared that these
            conditions in the basic industry of agriculture have
            affected transactions in agricultural commodities
            with a national public interest, have burdened and
            obstructed the normal currents of commerce in such
            commodities and rendered imperative the immediate
            enactment of Title 1 of this act.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Now here we see that he is saying that the agricultural
assets support the national credit structure. Did he take the
titles of all the land? Remember &quot;Contracts payable in
gold!&quot; President Roosevelt needed the support, and
agriculture was critical, because of all the millions of acres of
farmland at that time, and the value of that farmland. The
mortgage on that farmland was what supported the emergency
credit. So President Roosevelt had to do something to stabilize
the price of land and Federal Reserve Bank notes to create money,
didn't he? So he impressed agriculture into the public interest.
The farming industry was nationalized.</p>

<p> Referring now back to Prize Cases (1862) (2 Black, 674)
(Exhibit 24):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;But in defining the meaning of the term

            the word, 'enemy'. It is a technical phrase peculiar
            to prize courts, and depends upon principles of
            public policy as distinguished from the common
            law.&quot; </i></p>

    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Once the emergency is declared, the common law is abolished,
the Constitution is abolished and we fall under the absolute will
of Government, public policy.</p>

<p> All the government needs to continue is to have public
opinion on their side. If public opinion can be kept, in
sufficient degree, on the side of the government, statutes, laws
and bills can continue to be passed. The Constitution has no
meaning. The Constitution is suspended. It has been for 60 years.
We're not under law. Law has been abolished.</p>

<p> We're under a system of public policy, (War Powers).</p>

<p> So when you go into that courtroom with your Constitution and
the common law in your hand, what does that judge tell you? He
tells you that you have no persona standi in judicio. You have no
personal standing at law. He tells you not to bother bringing the
Constitution into his court, because it is not a Constitutional
court, but an executive tribunal operating under a totally
different jurisdiction.</p>

        </blockquote>
    </dd>

<p> These agencies, of which there are now thousands, and which
now control every aspect of our lives, were ostensibly created as
temporary agencies meant to last only as long as the national
emergency. They have become, in fact, permanent agencies, as has
the state of national emergency itself. As Franklin Delano
Roosevelt said: &quot;We will never go back to the old
order.&quot; That quote takes on a different meaning in light of
what we have seen so far.</p>

    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Remember, this is Congress' own document, from the year 1973.</p>

<p> Most people might not look to agriculture to provide them
with this type of information. But let us look at Title III of
the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which is also called the
Emergency Farm Mortgage Act of 1933 (Exhibit 52):</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
    <i><p>&quot;Title III - Financing - And Exercising Power
    Conferred by Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution: To
    Coin Money And To Regulate the Value Thereof.&quot; </i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> From Section 43 of Exhibit 52:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Whenever the President finds upon
            investigation that the foreign commerce of the United
            States is adversely affected ... and an expansion of
            credit is necessary to secure by international
            agreement a stabilization at proper levels of the
            currencies of various governments, the President is
            authorized, in his discretion ... To direct the
            Secretary of the Treasury to enter into agreements
            with the several Federal Reserve banks...&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Remember that in the Constitution it states that Congress has
the authority to coin all money and regulate the value thereof.
How can it be then that the Executive branch is issuing an
emergency currency, and quoting the Constitution as its authority
to do so?</p>

<p> Under Section 1 of the same Act (Exhibit 53) we find the
following:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;To direct the Secretary of the treasury
            to cause to be issued in such amount or amounts as he

            authorize the issue of United States notes and for
            the redemption of funding thereof and for funding the
            floating debt of the United States, approved February
            25, 1862, and Acts supplementary thereto and
            amendatory thereof&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> What is the Act of February 25, 1862? It is the Greenback Act
of President Abraham Lincoln. Let us remember that, when Abraham
Lincoln was elected and inaugurated, he didn't even have a
Congress for the first six weeks. He did not, however, call an
extra session of Congress. He issued money, he declared war, he
suspended habeas corpus, it was an absolute Constitutional
dictatorship.</p>

<p> There was not even a Congress in session for six weeks.</p>

<p> When Lincoln's Congress came into session six weeks later,
they entered the following statement into the Congressional
record: <i>&quot;The actions, rules, regulations, licenses,
heretofore or hereafter taken, are hereby approved and
confirmed...&quot;</i> This is the exact language of March 9,
1933 and Title 12, USC, Section 95(b), today.</p>

<p> We now come to the question of how to terminate these
extraordinary powers granted under a declaration of national
emergency. We have learned that, in order for the extraordinary
powers to be terminated, the national emergency itself must be
canceled. Reading from the Agricultural Act, Section 13 (Exhibit
54):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;This title shall cease to be in effect
            whenever the President finds and proclaims that the
            national economic emergency in relation to
            agriculture has been ended.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Whenever the President finds by proclamation that the
proclamation issued on March 6, 1933 has terminated, it has to
terminate through presidential proclamation just as it came into
effect. Congress had already delegated all of that authority, and
therefore was in no position to take it back.</p>

<p> In Senate Report 93-549, we find the following statement from
Congress (Exhibit 55):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Furthermore, it would be largely futile
            task unless we have the President's active
            collaboration. Having delegated this authority to the
            President in ways that permit him to determine how
            long it shall continue, simply through the device of
            keeping emergency declarations alive - we now find
            ourselves in a position where we cannot reclaim the
            power without the President's acquiescence. We are
            unable to terminate these declarations without the
            President's signature, so we need a large measure of
            Presidential cooperation&quot;. </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> It appears that no president has been willing to give up this
extraordinary power, and, if they will not sign the termination
proclamation, the access to, and usage of, extraordinary powers
does not terminate. At least, it has not terminated for over 60
years.</p>

<p> Now, that's no definite indication that a President from Bill
Clinton on might not eventually sign the termination
proclamation, but 60 years of experience would lead one to doubt
that day will ever come by itself But the question now to ask is
this: How many times have We, the People, asked the President to
terminate his access to extraordinary powers, or the situation on
which it is based, the declared national emergency? Who has ever
demanded that this be done? How many of us even knew that it had
been done? And, without the knowledge contained in this report,
how long do you think the blindness of the American public to
this situation would have continued, and with it the abolishment
of the Constitution? But we're not quite as in the dark as we
were, are we?</p>

<p> In Senate Report 93-549 (Exhibit 56), we find the following
statement from Senator Church:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <i>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <p>&quot;These powers, if exercised, would confer
            upon the President total authority to do anything he
            pleased.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>

<p> Elsewhere in Senate Report 93-549, Senator Church makes the
remarkable statement (Exhibit 57):</p>

    <dd><blockquote>

            their original intention ... Machiavelli, in his
            &quot;Discourses of Livy,&quot; acknowledged that
            great power may have to be given to the Executive if
            the State is to survive, but warned of great dangers
            in doing so. He cautioned: Nor is it sufficient if
            this power be conferred upon good men; for men are
            frail, and easily corrupted, and then in a short
            time, he that is absolute may easily corrupt the
            people.&quot;</i></p>

<p> Now, a quote from an exclusive reply (Exhibit 58) written May
21, 1973, by the Attorney General of the United States regarding
studies undertaken by the Justice Department on the question of
the termination of the standing national emergency:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;As a consequence, a &quot;national
            emergency&quot; is now a practical necessity in order
            to carry out what has become the regular and normal
            method of governmental actions. What were intended by
            Congress as delegations of power to be used only in
            the most extreme situations, and for the most limited
            duration's, have become everyday powers, and a state
            of &quot;emergency&quot; has become a permanent
            condition.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> From United States v. Butler (Supreme Court, 1935) (Exhibit
59):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;A tax, in the general understanding and
            in the strict Constitutional sense, is an exaction
            for the support of government; the term does not
            connote the expropriation of money from one group to
            be expended for another, as a necessary means in a
            plan of regulation, such as the plan for regulating
            agricultural production set up in the Agricultural
            Adjustment Act.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> What is being said here is that a tax can only be an exaction
for the support of government, not for an expropriation from one
group for the use of another. That would be socialism, wouldn't
it?</p>

<p> Quoting further from United States v. Butler (Exhibit 60):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;The regulation of farmer's activities
            under the statute, though in form subject to his own
            will, is in fact coercion through economic pressure;
            his right of choice is illusory. Even if a farmer's
            consent were purely voluntary, the Act would stand no
            better. At best it is a scheme for purchasing with
            federal funds submission to federal regulation of a
            subject reserved to the states.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Speaking of contracts, those contracts are coercion
contracts. They are adhesion contracts made by a superior over an
inferior. They are under the belligerent capacity of government
over enemies. They are not valid contracts.</p>

<p> Again from <i>United States v. Butler</i> (Exhibit 61):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;If the novel view of the General Welfare
            Clause now advanced in support of the tax were
            accepted, this clause would not only enable Congress
            to supplant the states in the regulation of
            agriculture and all other industries as well, but
            would furnish the means whereby all of the other
            provisions of the Constitution, sedulously framed to
            define and limit the powers of the United States and
            preserve the powers of the states, could be broken
            down, the independence of the individual states
            obliterated, and the United States converted into a
            central government exercising uncontrolled police
            power throughout the union superseding all local
            control over local concerns.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Please, read the above paragraph again. The understanding of
its meaning is vital.</p>

<p> The United States Supreme Court ruled the New Deal, the
nationalization, unconstitutional in the Agricultural Adjustment
Act and they turned it down flat. The Supreme Court declared it
to be unconstitutional. They said, in effect, &quot;You're
turning the federal government into an uncontrolled police state,
exercising uncontrolled police power.&quot; What did Roosevelt do
next? He stacked the Supreme Court, didn't he? And in 1937, <i>United
States v. Butler </i>was overturned.</p>

<p> From the 65th Congress, 1st Session Doc. 87, under the
section entitled Constitutional Sources of Laws of War, Page 7,
Clause II, we find (Exhibit 62):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;The existence of war and the restoration
            of peace are to be determined by the political
            department of the government, and such determination
            is binding and conclusive upon the courts, and
            deprives the courts of the power of hearing proof and
            determining as a question of fact either that war
            exists or has ceased to exist.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> The courts will tell you that is a political question, for
they (the courts) do not have jurisdiction over the common law.</p>

<p> The courts were deprived of the Constitution. They were
deprived of the common law. There are now courts of prize over
the enemies, and we have no persona standi in judicio. We have no
personal standing under the law. Also from the 65th Congress,
under the section entitled Constitutional Sources of Laws of War,
we find (Exhibit 63):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;When the sovereign authority shall choose
            to bring it into operation, the judicial department
            must give effect to its will. But until that will
            shall be expressed, no power of condemnation can
            exist in the court.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> From Senate Report 93-549 (Exhibit 64):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Just how effective a limitation on crisis
            action this makes of the court is hard to say. In
            light of the recent war, the court today would seem
            to be a fairly harmless observer of the emergency
            activities of the President and Congress. It is
            highly unlikely that the separation of powers and the
            10th Amendment will be called upon again to hamstring
            the efforts of the government to deal resolutely with
            a serious national emergency.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> So much for our Constitutional system of checks and balances.
And from that same Senate Report, in the section entitled,
&quot;Emergency Administration&quot;, a continuation of Exhibit
64:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Organizationally, in dealing with the
            depression, it was Roosevelt's general policy to
            assign new, emergency functions to newly created
            agencies, rather than to already existing
            departments.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Thus, thousands of &quot;temporary&quot; emergency agencies,
are now sitting out there with emergency functions to rule us in
all cases whatsoever.</p>

<p> Finally, let us look briefly at the courts, specifically with
regard to the question of &quot;booty&quot;. The following
definition of the term, &quot;prize&quot; is to be found in
Bouvier's Law Dictionary (Exhibit 65):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Goods taken on land from a public enemy
            are called booty; and the distinction between a prize
            and booty consists in this, that the former is taken
            at sea and the latter on land.&quot; </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> This significance of the distinction between these two terms
is critical, a fact which will become quite clear shortly.</p>

<p> Let us now remember that <i>&quot;Congress shall have the
power to make rules on all captures on the land and the
water.&quot;</i> To reiterate, captures on the land are booty,
and captures on the water are prize.</p>

<p> Now, the Constitution says that Congress shall have the power
to provide and maintain a navy, even during peacetime. It also
says that Congress shall have the power to raise and support an
army, but no appropriations of money for that purpose shall be
for greater than two years. Here we can see that an army is not a
permanent standing body, because, in times of peace, armies were
held by the sovereign states as militia. So the United States had
a navy during peacetime, but no standing army; we had instead the
individual state militias.</p>

<p> Consequently, the federal government had a standing prize
court, due to the fact that it had a standing navy, whether in
times of peace or war. But in times of peace, there could be no
federal police power over the continental United States, because
there was to be no army.</p>

<p> From the report <u>The Law of Civil Government in Territory
Subject to Military Occupation by Military Forces of the United
States</u>, published by order of the Secretary of War in 1902,
under the heading entitled The Confiscation of Private Property
of Enemies in War (Exhibit 66), comes the following quote:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;4. Should the President desire to utilize
            the services of the Federal courts of the United
            States in promoting this purpose or military
            undertaking, since these courts derive their
            jurisdiction from Congress and do not constitute a
            part of the military establishment, they must secure
            from Congress the necessary action to confer such
            jurisdiction upon said courts.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> This means that, if the government is going to confiscate
property within the continental United States on the land
(booty), it must obtain statutory authority.</p>

<p> In this same section (Exhibit 66), we find the following
words:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;5. The laws and usage's of war make a
            distinction between enemies' property captured on the
            sea and property captured on land. The jurisdiction
            of the courts of the United States over property
            captured at sea is held not to attach to property
            captured on land in the absence of Congressional
            action.&quot; </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> There is no standing prize court over the land. Once war is
declared, Congress must give jurisdiction to particular courts
over captures on the land by positive Congressional action. To
continue with (Exhibit 66):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;The right of confiscation is a sovereign
            right. In times of peace, the exercise of this right
            is limited and controlled by the domestic
            Constitution and institutions of the government. In
            times of war, when the right is exercised against
            enemies' property as a war measure, such right
            becomes a belligerent right, and as such is not
            subject to the restrictions imposed by domestic
            institutions, but is regulated and controlled by the
            laws and usage's of war.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> So we see that our government can operate in two capacities:
(a) in its sovereign peacetime capacity, with the limitations
placed upon it by the Constitution and restrictions placed upon
it by We, the People, or (b) in a wartime capacity, where it may
operate in its belligerent capacity governed not by the
Constitution, but only by the laws of war.</p>

<p> In Section 17 of the Act of October 6, 1917, the Trading With
the Enemy Act (Exhibit 67):</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;That the district courts of the United
            States are hereby given jurisdiction to make and
            enter all such rules as to notice and otherwise; and
            all such orders and decrees; and to issue such
            process as may be necessary and proper in the
            premises to enforce the provisions of this act.&quot; </i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Here we have Congress conferring upon the district courts of
the United States the booty jurisdiction, the jurisdiction over
enemy property within the continental United States. And at the
time of the original, unamended, Trading with the Enemy Act, we
were indeed at war, a World war, and so booty jurisdiction over
enemies' property in the courts was appropriate. At that time,
remember, we were not yet declared the enemy. We were excluded
from the provisions of the original act.</p>

<p> In 1934 Congress passed an Act merging equity and law
abolishing common law. This Act, known as the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedures Act, was not to come into effect until 6 months
after the letter of transmittal from the Supreme Court to
Congress. The Supreme Court refused transmittal and the
transmittal did not occur until Franklin D. Roosevelt stacked the
Supreme Court in 1938 (Exhibits 67(a) and (b)).</p>

<p> But on March the 9th of 1933, the American people were
declared to be the public enemy under the amended version of the
Trading With the Enemy Act. What jurisdiction were We, the
People, then placed under? We were now the booty jurisdiction
given to the district courts by Congress. </p>

<p> It was no longer be necessary, or of any value at all, to
bring the Constitution of the United States with us upon entering
a courtroom, for that court was no longer a court of common law,
but a tribunal under wartime booty jurisdiction. Take a look at
the American flag in most American courtrooms. The gold fringe
around our flag designates Admiralty jurisdiction.</p>

<p> Executive Order No. 11677 issued by President Richard M.
Nixon August 1, 1972 (Exhibit 68) states:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Continuing the Regulation of Exports; By
            virtue of the authority vested in the President by
            the Constitution and statutes of the United States,
            including Section 5 (b) of the Act of October 6,
            1917, as amended (12 U. S. C. <a
            href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/12/95a.html">95a</a>),
            and in view of the continued existence of the
            national emergencies...&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Later, in the same Executive Order (Exhibit 69), we find the
following:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;...under the authority vested in me as
            President of the United States by Section 5(b) of the
            Act of October 6, 1917, as amended (12 U. S. C. <a
            href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/12/95a.html">95a</a>)...&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Section 5(b) certainly seems to be an one-sided support for
Presidential authority, doesn't it? Surely the reason for this
can be found by referring back to Exhibit 49, the words of Mr.
Katzenbach in Senate Report 93-549:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;My recollection is that almost every
            executive order ever issued straddles on several
            grounds, but it almost always includes the Trading
            With the Enemy Act because the language of that act
            is so broad, it would justify almost anything.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> The question here, and it should be a question of grave
concern to every American, is what type of acts can &quot;almost
anything&quot; cover? What has been, and is being, done, by our
government under the cloak of authority conferred by Section 5(b)
? By now, I think we are beginning to know.</p>

<p> Has the termination of the national emergency ever been
considered? In Public Law 94412, September 14, 1976 (Exhibit 70),
we find that Congress had finally finished their exhaustive study
on the national emergencies, and the words of their findings were
that they would terminate the existing national emergencies. We
should be able to heave a sigh of relief at this decision, for
with the termination of the national emergencies will come the
corresponding termination of extraordinary Presidential power,
won't it? But yet we have learned two difficult lessons: that we
are still in the national emergency, and that power, once
grasped, is difficult to let go. And so now it should come as no
surprise when we read, in the last section of the Act, Section
502 (Exhibit 71), the following words:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;(a): The provisions of this act shall not
            apply to the following provisions of law, the powers
            and authorities conferred thereby and actions taken
            thereunder (1) Section 5(b) of the Act of October
            6,1917, as amended (12 U. S. C. <a
            href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/12/95a.html">95a</a>;
            50 U. S. C. App. 5b)&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> The bleak reality is, the situation has not changed at all.</p>

<p> The alarming situation in which We, the People, find
ourselves today causes us to think back to a time over two
hundred years ago in our nation's history when our forefathers
were also laboring under the burden of governmental usurpation of
individual rights. Their response, written in 1774, two years
before the signing of the Declaration of Independence, to the
attempts of Great Britain to retain extraordinary powers it had
held during a time of war became known as the &quot;Declaration
of Rights&quot; (Exhibit 72). And in that document, we find these
words:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Whereas, since the close of the last war,
            the British Parliament, claiming a power of right to
            bind the people of America, by statute, in all cases
            whatsoever, hath in some acts expressly imposed taxes
            on them. and in others, under various pretenses, but
            in fact for the purpose of raising a revenue, hath
            imposed rates and duties payable in these colonies
            established a board of commissioners, with
            unconstitutional powers, and extended the
            jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty, not only for
            collecting the said duties, but for the trial of
            causes merely arising within the body of a
            county.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> We can see now that we have come full circle to the situation
which existed in 1774, but with one crucial difference. In 1774,
Americans were protesting against a colonial power which sought
to bind and control its colony by wartime powers in a time of
peace. In 1994, it is our own government which has sought,
successfully to date, to bind its own people by the same subtle,
insidious method.</p>

<p> Article 3, Section 3, of our Constitution states:</p>

<p> </p>

<dl>
    <dd><blockquote>
            <i><p>&quot;Treason against the United States, shall
            consist only in levying War against them, or in
            adhering to their Enemies, giving them aid and
            comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason
            unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same
            overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.&quot;</i></p>
        </blockquote>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Is the Act of March 9, 1933, treason? That would be for the
common law courts to decide. At this point in our nation's
history, the point is moot, for common law, and indeed the
Constitution itself, do not operate or exist at present. Whether
governmental acts of theft of the nation's money, the citizens'
property, and American liberty as an ideal and a reality which
have occurred since 1933 is treason against the people of the
United States, as the term is defined by the Constitution of the
United States cannot even be determined or argued in the legal
sense until the Constitution itself is reestablished. For our
part, however, we firmly believe that, &quot;by their fruits ye
shall know them&quot;, and on that authority we rest our case.</p>

<p> <b>CONCLUSION</b> As you have just witnessed, the United
States of America continues to exist in a governmentally ordained
state of national emergency. Under such a state of emergency, our
Constitution has been set aside, ostensibly for the public good,
until the emergency is canceled.</p>

<p> But, as experience painfully shows, it has not been to the
public's good that our government has used its unrestricted
power, unhampered by the Constitution's restraining force. The
governmental edicts and actions over the past six decades have
led us to the desperate state in which we find ourselves today.
Besieged on every side, corroding from within, frightened and in
despair, we as a nation are being torn asunder.</p>

<p> There is, a national emergency today, one of life and death
proportions, but it is not the emergency used by our government
to continue its abuse of power. It is this very abuse, this
unbridled rape of the American spirit, that is the crux of the
emergency we are in today. But this true emergency cannot be
cured by setting aside the Constitution; no, it can only be
controlled by returning to the laws of God and Country which have
been stolen from us by those in whom we placed our trust to
protect the national interest.</p>

<p> We are a nation whose government is based upon those immortal
words, &quot;a government of the people, by the people, for the
people&quot;. One has only to walk down the highways and byways
of this great land to know all too well that this is not a
government of the people or for the people. Actions speak louder
than words, and the actions taken over the past decades have
resulted in an unparalleled decline of American economic and
political power, and a weakening of American values and spirit.</p>

<p> This is not a crisis in which the taking up of arms is the
answer. No, this is a situation in which we firmly believe that
the pen will be mightier than the sword. That a state of
emergency exists cannot be disputed. That the emergency is one
which should concern every American alive cannot be denied. That
we must stand together, laying aside our individual differences,
to fight the common foe, is of vital importance, for the time to
act is now. But this is not a battle of swords, but of knowledge,
for only when the deception is exposed to the light of day can
the healing process begin.</p>

<p> Truth stands tall in the light of day, and it is the truth we
bring to you today. Let it be known and understood that it is our
intention to make this information available to every concerned
American who desires to know the true State of the Union. This is
an undertaking of immense proportions, but we have dedicated
ourselves to bringing this information to the light of day, and
with the help of &quot;We, the People&quot;, we will be
successful in our efforts.</p>

<p> Every American who is thankful for the opportunity to call
themselves American must also accept the responsibility that
comes with that title. We the People have not only a right, but a
responsibility to each other and to those who have gone before us
to learn what our government is doing, and to judge whether
actions taken benefit the people who will bear the costs. We have
been in the dark long enough, content to rest on our past glories
and let the government take its course. In a way, we have been
like children, trusting in our parents to act in our best
interest. But as we have too frequently seen in the nightly news,
not all parents have their children's best interest at heart.</p>

<p> The time has come for us to take off our blinders and accept
reality, for the time of national reckoning has arrived. The
majority of our elected and appointed officials are no more
responsible for the current state of affairs than are we. The
strings are being manipulated at far higher levels than the
positions most officials occupy. They are working with little
knowledge or authority, trying to control problems far bigger
than even they realize. Their programs and actions may seek to
cure the symptoms, but the time has now come to attack the
disease. They are no more guilty than we are, nor will they be
any more protected when the nation collapses on us all.</p>

<p> If we blame them for this national emergency, we must also
truly blame ourselves, for it is &quot;We the People&quot; to
whom this nation was given and whose duty it was to keep a
watchful eye on those who direct the sails of the ship of state.
We have, however, fallen asleep, and while we were dreaming the
American dream, a band of pirates stole the Constitution and put
our people into slavery.</p>

<p> And since that terrible day when our Constitution was cast
aside, not one President or Congress, nor one Supreme Court
justice has been able or willing to return it to its rightful
owners. Given the current state of the union, there is no reason
to expect this situation to change unless we ourselves cause it
to be so.</p>

<p> Let us put the childish emotions of pity and self-deception
away, stand up, stand together and fight back. Now is the time to
stop dreaming, and start the long work before us. Now is the time
to turn back to the principles and ideals on which this nation
was founded, the strong foundation from which our national
identity springs.</p>

<p> When does tolerance become anarchy? When does protection
become slavery? When is enough enough? Now is when - here and
now.</p>

<p> Now is the time to return to the laws set forth by God, and
throw off these chains of ignorance and bondage which grip our
nation to the point of death. Let us return to the source, the
standard of excellence set for us long ago. Our message to
Congress and all elected and appointed officials must be,
&quot;Let my people go!&quot;, for we are all laboring under a
system which will eventually crush us, regardless of our
religion, our sex, or the color of our skin.</p>

<p> We must let those at all levels of governmental authority
know that we have learned of the deception which lies at the core
of our national malaise. We must tell them in no uncertain terms
that we will tolerate this great lie no longer, and we must put
them on notice that we expect them to resign if they have not the
courage and the resolve to help this nation in its hour of need.</p>

<p> We have been fools long enough. No matter how long after the
date you read this report, start each and every week without fail
to give a copy of this information to at least one person you
know. We also ask you to write a letter to Congress telling them
to &quot;Let our People go&quot;, or you can use the form letter
you will find enclosed in the report.</p>

<p> We must let our elected officials know that we expect them as
servants of the people to help us reestablish law and order and
restore our national pride. They must, repeal proclamation 2039,
2040, and Title 12 USC 95(a) and 95(b), thereby canceling the
National Emergency, and reestablish the Constitution of this
nation.</p>

<p> Now is the time for excellence of action. We demand it and
will accept nothing less. This is our country, to protect and
defend, no matter the cost. To do nothing out of fear or apathy
is exactly what those in power are hoping for, for it is
ignorance and apathy that the darkness likes best. We must not be
a party to the darkness enveloping our nation any longer. We must
come into the light, and give our every drop of blood, sweat and
tears to bring our nation back with us.</p>

<p> We must acknowledge that if we do nothing, if we are not
willing to act now and act boldly, without fear but with faith
and a firm resolve, our freedom to act, at all may soon be taken
away altogether. New bills, new laws are being presented dally
which will effectively serve to tighten the chains of bondage
already encircling this nation.</p>

<p> My friends, we are not going into slavery, we are already
there. Make no mistake those in power are already tightening the
chains, but they are doing so slowly, quietly and with great
caution, for fear of awakening the slumbering lion which is the
voice of the American people. There is yet still time for us to
slip loose the chains which bind us, and for us to bring about
the restoration of this nation.</p>

<p> If we act, if we make our concerns known and shout out our
refusal to accept the future which has been planned for us by
those who hold no allegiance to this great land of ours, we can
yet demand and see come to pass the day when the state of
emergency is canceled and the Constitution is restored to her
rightful place as the watchdog of those for whom absolute power
corrupts absolutely. If we repent of our ignorance and our
apathy, and return to the God-given laws on which this nation was
founded, we may yet be free.</p>

<p> We will continue to hold meetings and offer this information
until everyone in America has had an opportunity to hear it and
we have set our nation free. We will not tolerate less. We are
Americans and that means far more than most of us realize.</p>

<p> If it first it seems you are working alone, do not give up,
for as this information spreads across the land to the great
cities and small towns, you will find yourself in excellent
company. You already are as only one, for behind you stand all
the heroes of our history who fought and died to keep this nation
free.</p>

<p> Again, we must stress that we are not asking you to pick up
guns; in fact, we implore you not to, no matter how angry the
news of this deception has made you. Turn your anger into a
steely resolve, a fierce determination not to give up until the
battle has been won. We are not asking you for lots of money;
that's their game, the &quot;almighty dollar&quot;. It is the
substitution of wealth and possessions for integrity and honor
that helped get us into this true state of emergency in which we
find ourselves now. We are not asking you for more time than you
can give, although we do ask you to give what time you can to get
this information out.</p>

<p> What we ask from you is your commitment to stand with those
around you to help us restore this nation to her rightful place
in history, both that written and that yet to be told. Abraham
Lincoln once said, &quot;We the People are the rightful masters
of both Congress and the Courts - not to overthrow the
Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the
Constitution&quot;. We must stand together now in this, our
national hour of need. As the United States Supreme Court once
said, &quot;It is not the function of our government to keep the
citizen from falling into error; it is the function of the
citizen to keep the government from falling into error&quot;.</p>

<p> Each individual, their attitudes and actions, forges their
own special link in the great chain of history. Now is the time
to add to that precious inheritance of honor and duty which has
kept America alive because the choices we make and the actions we
take today are a part of history as well as our future.</p>

<p> The vision for America has not died; the &quot;land of the
free and the home of the brave&quot; still exists. There is still
time to turn the tide for this great land, but we must join
together to make it happen. We have a debt of honor to the past
and the future, a call to glory to rescue out homeland from the
hands of those who would see her fall. We cannot, we must not
fail.</p>

<p> Sir:</p>

<p> I am an American citizen who is aware of the extraordinary
powers conferred upon you by the declared state of &quot;national
emergency&quot; under which America has labored for over sixty
years. These powers, available to the Executive branch since
March of 1933, have effectively placed the American people in
slavery, by nationalizing the vital industries of this nation and
removing the common law from our court system.</p>

<p> I understand that, because of this ongoing &quot;national
emergency&quot;, the Constitution of the United States has been
effectively set aside. I remind you now of the oath you took upon
entering the office which you now occupy by permission of the
American peopl e. When you took your oath of office, you swore
that you would uphold the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p> I charge you now to carry out the duties and actions of your
oath of office, and return the Constitution to its rightful place
in our government by canceling the state of national emergency. I
urge you to repeal Proclamations 2039 and 2040, and the amend ed
version of the Trading with the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917,
especially Section 5 (b), under which so many actions injurious
to the spirit and livelihood of the American people have been
taken. If you are unwilling or unable to take these steps towar d
restoring America to the Constitutional republic she was designed
to be, I urge you to resign from your position as a servant of
the American people.</p>

<p> I will continue to urge our government to correct this
situation until such time as you have canceled the state of
national emergency, and returned the Constitution of the United
States to its rightful owners - We, the People.</p>

Prior to adoption of 12 USCS  95b it was assumed that presidential proclamation which purported to be directed against hoarding of cash was well supported by federal statute, and the regulations under it were valid, and that compliance therewith was compulsory.  Kullman & Co. v. Woolley (1936, CA 5 Miss) 83 F2d 129.<P>

Closing of national bank by Presidential proclamation was reasonable step to be taken in financial emergency which confronted country and was authorized by 12 USCS  95, 95a and 95b, all of which are constitutional.  Smith v. Witherow (1939, CA 3 Pa) 102 F2d 638.<P>

President was not authorized to declare bank holiday by Trading with Enemy Act of 1917 but lack of authority was remedied by passage of 12 USCS  95b.  United States v. Briddle (1962, DC Cal) 212 F Supp 584.<P>

Foreclosure sale by bank on date that Presidential proclamation declaring bank holiday was issued was legal since President was without authority to make proclamation as of that date and enactment of 12 USCS  95b later did not render illegal what had been legally done.  Anthony v. Bank of Wiggins (1938) 183 Miss 885, 184 So 626.</BODY></HTML>

QUESTIONS PRESENTED FOR REVIEW 
I.	Whether the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration erred in ruling that the final rule of May 13, 
1986, placing synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated 
in soft gelatin capsules in Schedule II did not included the 
rescheduling of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol itself. 
II.	Whether the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration erred in ruling that the final rule of May 13, 
1986, placing synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated 
in soft gelatin capsules in Schedule II did not included the 
rescheduling of marijuana. 
III.	Whether the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration erred procedurally by refusing to accept the 
petition and ruling on its merit, simultaneously. 
STATUTES AND REGULATIONS 
	The pertinent statues and regulations are set forth in an 
addendum bound with this brief. 
JURISDICTION 
	The final order of the Drug Enforcement Administration was 
issued on October 23, 1992.  My Petition for Review was received 
by this Court on November 12, 1992, and assigned Docket No. 92-
8041.  My Petition for Review was subsequently filed in forma 
pauperis by this Court on February 8, 1993, and reassigned Docket 
No. 93-1109 [App., p. 17].  This Court has jurisdiction of this 
petition for review of a final order of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration pursuant to 21 U.S.C.  877. 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
	1.	THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT. 
	In 1970 Congress enacted the Controlled Substances Act 
(CSA), a comprehensive statute designed to rationalize federal 
control of dangerous drugs.  The Act contains five categories of 
controlled substances, designated as Schedules I through V and 
defined in terms of dangers and benefits.  21 U.S.C.  812(b)(1)-
(5).  The control mechanisms imposed on manufacture, acquisition, 
and distribution of substances listed under the Act vary 
according to the schedule in which the substance is contained.  
Substances in Schedules I & II are subject to the most severe 
restrictions, and substances in Schedule V are subject to the 
least severe restrictions.  In drafting the CSA Congress placed 
marijuana in Schedule I, one of the two classifications that 
provides for the most severe restrictions. 
	Recognizing that the results of continuous research might 
cast doubt on the wisdom of initial classification assignments, 
Congress created a procedure by which changes in scheduling could 
be effected.  Pursuant to Section 201(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C.  
811(a), the Attorney General "may, by rule," add a substance to a 
schedule, transfer it between schedules, or remove it from the 
schedules.  A reclassification rule promulgated under this 
section must be made on the record after opportunity for hearing, 
in accordance with the rulemaking procedures prescribed by the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. ch. 5, subch. II.  Section 
201(a) further provides that rescheduling proceedings may be 
initiated by the Attorney General on his [or her] own motion, at 
the request of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), 
or, as in the present case, on petition of any interested party. 
	Section 501(a) of the CSA, 21 U.S.C.  871(a), authorizes 
the Attorney General to "delegate any of his functions under this 
subchapter to any officer or employee of the Department of 
Justice."  The functions vested in the Attorney General by the 
CSA have been delegated to the Acting Administrator of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) pursuant to 28 C.F.R.  
0.100(b) & 0.132(d) (1992). 
	DEA's Acting Administrator must share his [or her] decision-
making function under the Act with the Secretary of HHS.  Section 
201(b), 21 U.S.C.  811(b), provides that, prior to commencement 
of reclassification rulemaking proceedings, the Attorney General 
must "request from the Secretary a scientific and medical 
evaluation, and his [or her] recommendations, as to whether such 
drug or other substance should be so controlled or removed as a 
controlled substance."  The evaluation prepared by the Secretary 
must address the scientific and medical factors enumerated in 
Section 201(c), 21 U.S.C.  811(c); these factors relate to the 
effects of the drug and its abuse potential.  Pursuant to Section 
201(b), the Secretary's recommendations "shall be binding on the 
Attorney General as to such scientific and medical matters, and 
if the Secretary recommends that a drug or other substance not be 
controlled, the Attorney General shall not control the drug or 
other substance." 
	Section 201(d) of the Act, 21 U.S.C.  811(d), contains a 
limited exception to the referral procedures detailed in Section 
201(b)-(c).  Subsection (d)(1) provides: 
	If control is required by United States obligations under 
international treaties, conventions, or protocols in effect on 
October 27, 1970, the Attorney General shall issue an order 
controlling such drug under the schedule he [or she] deems most 
appropriate to carry out such obligations, without regard to the 
findings required by subsection (a) of this section or section 
812(b) of this title and without regard to the procedures 
prescribed by sections (a) and (b) of this section. 
	2.	THE SINGLE CONVENTION ON NARCOTIC DRUGS. 
	In 1948, in order to simplify existing treaties and 
international administrative machinery, members of the United 
Nations undertook codification of a single convention on 
international narcotics control.  In 1961, after three 
preliminary drafts, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 
1961, 18 U.S.T. 1407 (1967), 520 U.N.T.S. 204 (1964), was opened 
for signature.  The United States ratified the Single Convention 
in 1967 -- three years prior to enactment of the CSA. 
	Like the CSA, the Single Convention establishes several 
classifications or "schedules" of substances, to which varying 
regimes of control attach.  Schedule I of the Single Convention 
contains substances considered to carry a relatively high abuse 
liability; included in this category are heroin, methadone, 
opium, coca leaf, and cocaine.  Schedule II and III contain those 
substances regarded as less susceptible to abuse.  Finally, 
Schedule IV of the Single Convention -- unlike CSA schedule IV -- 
embraces certain Schedule I substances, such as heroin, the abuse 
liability of which is not offset by substantial therapeutic 
advantages.  Marijuana (cannabis) is listed in Schedules I and IV 
of the Single Convention, however, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(delta-9-THC) is not listed in the schedules of the Single 
Convention. 
	3.	THE CONVENTION ON PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES. 
	In 1978 Congress enacted the Psychotropic Substances Act 
(PSA), Pub. L. 95-633, Nov. 10, 1978, 92 Stat. 2768, to coincide 
with the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, signed at Vienna, 
Austria on February 21, 1971 [The Convention entered into force 
in respect to the United States on July 15, 1980], 1019 U.N.T.S. 
175 (1976), Treaty No. 14,596.  Section 101 of the PSA, 21 U.S.C. 
 801a, provides, in part: 
	The United States has joined with other countries in 
executing an international treaty, entitled the Convention on 
Psychotropic Substances and signed at Vienna, Austria, on 
February 21, 1971, which is designed to establish suitable 
controls over the manufacture, distribution, transfer, and use of 
certain psychotropic substances. 
	The Convention on Psychotropic Substances contains four 
categories of controlled substances, designated as Schedules I 
through IV and defined in terms of dangers and benefits.  The 
international control mechanisms imposed on manufacture, 
acquisition, and distribution of substances listed under the 
Convention on Psychotropic Substances vary according to the 
schedule in which the substance is contained.  Substances in 
Schedule I are subject to the most severe restrictions, and 
substances in Schedule IV are subject to the least severe 
restrictions. 
	In drafting the Convention on Psychotropic Substances the 
parties placed tetrahydrocannabinols in Schedule I, the 
classification that provides for the most severe restrictions.  
However, "At its 1,045th meeting, on April 29, 1991, the 
Commission on Narcotic Drugs, in accordance with article 2, 
paragraphs 5 and 6, of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 
1971, decided, by a vote of 33 in favor and 5 against, with no 
abstentions, that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (also referred to 
as delta-9-THC) and its stereochemical variants should be 
transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of that Convention."  
Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 1991, 
Supplement No. 4 (E/1991/24, Supp. No. 4), pp. 23 and 98 [App., 
p. 10].  The five States voting against the decision were 
Colombia, Ivory Coast, Egypt, France and Pakistan.  Id. 
	4.	HISTORY OF THIS CASE. 
	There are currently two other petitions for review, seeking 
to have marijuana moved from Schedule I to Schedule II of the 
CSA, now pending before this Court.  Alliance for Cannabis 
Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 92-1168, and 
Drug Policy Foundation v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 
92-1179.  The Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT) and the 
Drug Policy Foundation (DPF) allege that marijuana has accepted 
medical use in treatment in the United States, 21 U.S.C.  
812(b)(2)(B), and seek rescheduling on that basis.  They are 
seeking review of a final order of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA), issued on March 26, 1992, finding that 
marijuana does not have accepted medical use in treatment in the 
United States.  57 Fed. Reg. 10,499. 
	The scheduling of marijuana under the Controlled Substances 
Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C.  812, as well as under international 
obligations, has been under consideration by this Court on 
several prior occasions.  NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. 
Cir. 1974); NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977); and, ACT 
v. DEA, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  The issue is still 
pending before this Court in ACT v. DEA, No. 92-1168, and DPF v. 
DEA, No. 92-1179. 
	ACT and DPF inherited their case from NORML which filed a 
petition to have marijuana removed from the CSA with the Bureau 
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) on May 18, 1972.  The 
BNDD refused to accept the petition for filing, and this Court 
had to order the DEA to respond.  NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 
654 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  Upon remand the DEA held that 
international treaty obligations required it to place marijuana 
in Schedule I of the CSA.  This Court then remanded the petition 
back to the DEA again, holding that marijuana can be placed in 
either Schedule I or Schedule II of the CSA without violating 
international treaty obligations, and requiring the DEA to hold 
hearings to determine in which of the two schedules, Schedule I 
or Schedule II, marijuana properly belongs.  NORML v. DEA, 559 
F.2d 735, 757 (D.C. Cir. 1977). 
	In the final order for which ACT and DPF seek review, the 
Administrator listed five criteria for determining accepted 
medical use, and found that marijuana failed to satisfy all five 
criteria.  The Administrator said, "First, marijuana's chemistry 
is neither fully known, nor reproducible."  57 Fed. Reg. at 
10,507.  The Administrator went on to explain why marijuana 
failed to satisfy the remaining four criteria, but these four 
will not be repeated here, because failure to satisfy the first 
criterion would almost certainly mean failure to satisfy the 
remaining four. 
	After reading the Administrator's final ruling of March 26, 
1992, I sent a letter to the Administrator on July 21, 1992, 
asking why coca and opium poppy plants are scheduled in Schedule 
II of the CSA, since both of these plants are subject to the same 
variances in chemistry as the marijuana plant (neither are 
reproducible in standardized dosages) [App., p. 1]. 
	On August 17, 1992, the Administrator replied by stating 
that "these plant materials [coca and opium poppy] have 
historically been recognized as the source for a variety of 
accepted and useful medications."  Letter from the Administrator, 
dated August 17, 1992 [App., p. 5].  The Administrator also 
stated that "the petition to reschedule marijuana did not involve 
the scheduling of any medically useful compound to be extracted 
from the plant material."  Id. 
	Interpreting the Administrator's statements regarding 
scheduling of coca and opium poppy plants and scheduling of a 
medically useful compound extracted from marijuana as general 
rules, I then filed my own Petition to Reschedule Marijuana based 
on the fact that in 1986 dronabinol, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(delta-9-THC), the principle psychoactive substance in the 
marijuana plant, was rescheduled to Schedule II of the Controlled 
Substances Act, and, therefore, marijuana must be moved into the 
same schedule as dronabinol [App., p. 2].  See Final Order of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration, May 13, 1986, 51 Fed. Reg. 
17,476 (placing dronabinol in Schedule II). 
	My petition was filed on September 11, 1992, pursuant to 21 
U.S.C.  811 and 21 C.F.R.  1307.03, in the form prescribed by 
21 C.F.R.  1308.44(b). 
	 The Administrator responded to my petition by stating, "In 
a final rule published on May 13, 1986, then Administrator John 
C. Lawn placed a very specific substance, synthetic dronabinol in 
sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules, in Schedule 
II.  Administrator Lawn's action did not involve the rescheduling 
of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol itself, nor did it include any 
form of dronabinol other than the synthetic."  Final rule of the 
Administrator, October 23, 1992 [App., p. 7]. 
	The Administrator stated further, "Since I am not accepting 
your petition on the grounds that dronabinol is a wholly 
synthetic substance, not obtained from marijuana, it is 
unnecessary for me to consider the broader question of whether 
the rescheduling of marijuana would be appropriate if accepted 
medications were indeed obtained from that source."  Id.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  
	By definition, a synthetic drug is the same as its natural  
occurring twin.  Delta-9-THC is only one substance, not two.  In  
1986, Health and Human Services (HHS) recognized that synthetic  
delta-9-THC is the same as its naturally occurring twin.  The DEA  
must accept this scientific and medical findings of HHS.  
	The DEA is trying to do something with delta-9-THC that it  
doesn't do with any other drug, placing the synthetic drug in a  
different schedule than its naturally occurring twin.  The DEA is  
not authorized to make such distinctions.  The DEA must defer to  
HHS for scientific and medical findings.  
	Neither can the DEA rely on FDA marketing approval of   
Marinol, synthetic dronabinol "in sesame oil and encapsulated in  
soft gelatin capsules," as a reason for keeping all other forms  
of delta-9-THC in Schedule I.  Sesame oil and gelatin capsules  
are simply foods, which are not subject to control under the CSA.   
It is delta-9-THC which is in Schedule II, not just the FDA  
approved product Marinol.  
	In 1986, when marijuana became the source of an accepted and  
useful medication, delta-9-THC, it should have been transferred  
into the same schedule of the CSA, Schedule II, as the other  
plants, coca and opium, which are the sources of the accepted and  
useful medications cocaine and morphine.  
ARGUMENT  
	1.	SYNTHETIC AND NATURAL DELTA-9-THC ARE THE SAME.  
	The Administrator's decision that synthetic delta-9-THC in  
sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules, but not  
delta-9-THC itself, has been rescheduled, and that delta-9-THC is  
not obtained from marijuana, is beyond the scope of the DEA's  
authority.  
	This Court must review the DEA's decision to schedule delta- 
9-THC simultaneously in two different schedules in light of the  
guidelines set forth by the Supreme Court in Chevron U.S.A., Inc.  
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104  
S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).  In Chevron, the Court  
explained that a reviewing court must employ a two-step analysis  
that focuses initially on the intentions of Congress:  
First, always, is the question whether Congress had directly  
spoken to the precise question at issue.  If the intent of  
Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court,  
as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously  
expressed intent of Congress.  
Id. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781 (emphasis supplied).  In the  
absence of congressional intent, however, the court must proceed  
to a second inquiry:  
If ... the court determines Congress has not directly addressed  
the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose  
its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the  
absence of an administrative interpretation.  Rather, if the  
statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific  
issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer  
is based on a permissible construction of the statute.  
Id. at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-82 (footnote omitted; emphasis  
supplied).  
	In enacting the CSA, "Members of the House repeatedly stated  
that the Department of Justice should make judgments based on law  
enforcement considerations, while HEW should have the final say  
with respect to medical and scientific determinations."  NORML v.  
DEA, 559 F.2d at 746.  The Department of Justice "may not  
schedule a substance under the CSA without first obtaining the  
recommendation of the FDA, through its parent agency, HHS, 21  
U.S.C.  811(b), and providing an 'opportunity for a hearing  
pursuant to rulemaking procedures prescribed by [the  
Administrative Procedures Act].' 21 U.S.C.  811(a)."  Grinspoon  
v. DEA, 828 F.2d 881, 890 (1st Cir. 1987).  "This request is  
filed with the Commissioner of FDA, who has the responsibility  
for coordination of activities within [HHS]."  NORML v. DEA, 559  
F.2d at 749 n.59.  
	As this Court stated in 1977:  
	Our interpretation of Section 201(d) ensures proper  
allocation of decisionmaking responsibility between the Attorney  
General and the Secretary of HEW, in accordance with their  
respective spheres of expertise.  Section 201(d) directs the  
Attorney General, as an initial matter, to make a legal judgment  
as to controls necessitated by international commitments.  He  
then establishes a minimum schedule or level of control below  
which placement of the substance may not fall.  Determination of  
a minimum schedule ensures that the Secretary's recommendation,  
which ordinarily would be binding as to medical and scientific  
findings, does not cause a substance to be scheduled in violation  
of treaty obligations.  However, once that minimum schedule is  
established by the Attorney General, the decision whether to  
impose controls more restrictive than required by treaty  
implicates the same medical and scientific considerations as do  
scheduling decisions regarding those few substances not  
controlled by treaty.  The Secretary of HEW is manifestly more  
competent to make these nonlegal evaluations and recommendations.  
NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d at 747.  
	Although the FDA has approved a New Drug Application (NDA)  
for Marinol, synthetic delta-9-THC in sesame oil and encapsulated  
in soft gelatin capsules, this does not qualify as a  
recommendation to the DEA for purposes of scheduling.  FDA has  
never recommended that delta-9-THC remain in Schedule I while  
Marinol is in Schedule II, nor has it said that synthetic delta- 
9-THC is better than delta-9-THC itself.  [App., p. 15]  
	This is not the first time the DEA has tried to follow  
verbatim text of FDA marketing approval for a New Drug  
Application (NDA) in making a scheduling determination.  As this  
Court stated in 1991:  
The First Circuit in Grinspoon v. Drug Enforcement  
Administration, 828 F.2d 881, 891-92 (1st Cir. 1987), upon which  
petitioners rely, had held that earlier criteria the  
Administrator had employed to define "currently accepted medical  
use" were contrary to the statute because they were a carbon copy  
of those used by the FDA in licensing new drugs.  The present  
criteria, it is argued, duplicate a number of those original  
criteria.  But the criteria challenged in Grinspoon included  
several elements, such as the availability of patent information  
or FDA-required labeling, which were necessary only to market the  
drug in interstate commerce.  These criteria are clearly relevant  
to the FDA's mission, but not the DEA's, see Grinspoon, 828 F.2d  
at 887.  The First Circuit never suggested the DEA Administrator  
was foreclosed from incorporating and relying on those standards  
employed by the FDA that are relevant to the pharmaceutical  
qualities of the drug.  The court merely held that while FDA  
approval is sufficient to establish the existence of an accepted  
medical use, the converse in not true -- that absent FDA  
approval, commonly accepted medical use cannot be proven.  Id. at  
890.  Nor can we conceive of a reason the Administrator should be  
barred from employing notions developed by a sister agency  
insofar as those notions serve the missions of both agencies.  
ACT v. DEA, 930 F.2d at 939-40.    
	In 1987, the First Circuit said,   
[W]e find no necessary linkage between failure to obtain FDA  
interstate marketing approval and a determination that the  
substance in question is unsafe and has no medical use.  Indeed,  
the FDCA does not even mention the term 'medical use.'  In short,  
it is plainly possible that a substance may fail to obtain  
interstate marketing approval even if it has an accepted medical  
use.    
Grinspoon, 828 F.2d at  887.  "Thus, it is possible that a  
substance may have both an accepted medical use and safety for  
use under medical supervision, even though no one has deemed it  
necessary to seek approval for interstate marketing."  Id.  
	A synthetic drug is the same as its naturally occurring  
twin, by definition.  Under this Court's order of June 4, 1982,  
in NORML v. DEA, No. 79-1660, the Department of Health and Human  
Services (DHHS) was required to submit reports on the status of  
its recommendations for the scheduling of THC and marijuana  
plants.  In reference to the DEA's rescheduling order of May 13,  
1986 (51 Fed. Reg. 17,476) the DHHS stated that, "Dronabinol is  
structurally the same as THC."  [App., p. 8]  
	The Administrator says that marijuana is not the source of  
an accepted and useful medication, but there is considerable  
evidence to the contrary.  In his final order on NORML's  
petition, the Administrator adopted in their entirety the  
findings of the former Administrator.  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,507.   
The former Administrator, in his final order on NORML's petition,   
stated, "There is no difference in the pharmacological effect  
between the THC isolated from cannabis and the synthetically  
produced THC which is now marketed in the United States."  54  
Fed. Reg. at 53,774.  As this Court noted in 1991, "The First  
Circuit never suggested the DEA Administrator was foreclosed from  
incorporating and relying on those standards employed by the FDA  
that are relevant to the pharmaceutical qualities of the drug."   
ACT v. DEA, 930 F.2d at 939.  The former Administrator, in  
agreement with HHS, recognized that the pharmaceutical qualities  
of synthetic delta-9-THC are the same as those of delta-9-THC  
itself.   
	In his final order on NORML's petition, the Administrator  
stated, "There are scientific studies showing pure THC (Delta-9- 
Tetrahydrocannabinol), one of the many chemicals found in  
marijuana, has some effect in controlling nausea and vomiting.   
Pure THC is pharmaceutically made in clean capsule form, called  
Marinol, and is available for use by the medical community.  More  
information on Marinol can be found in the 'Physicians' Desk  
Reference,' available in most libraries."  57 Fed. Reg. at  
10,500.  The 1993 Physician's Desk Reference describes Marinol as  
follows: "Dronabinol, commonly known as delta-9-THC, is one of  
the major active substances in marijuana."  Id. at p. 2076.  
	Synthetic delta-9-THC is an exact duplicate of its naturally  
occurring twin, delta-9-THC.  "Following the isolation and  
characterization of delta-9-THC as the major active component of  
marijuana by Mechoulam and colleagues, a technique for producing  
synthetic material was developed."  Plasse, T.; Gorter, R.;  
Krasnow, S.; Lane, M.; Shepard, K.; Wadleigh, R. Recent Clinical  
Experience With Dronabinol.  Pharmacology Biochemistry &  
Behavior, Vol. 40, pp. 695-700; 1991 (Gaoni, Y.; Mechoulam, R.  
The isolation and structure of 1-tetrahydrocannabinol and other  
neutral cannabinoids from hashish. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93:217-224;  
1971)  (Petrzilka, T.; Haefliger, W.; Sikemeier, C. Synthesis of  
hashish components. Part 4. Helv. Chim. Acta 52:1102-1134; 1969).  
	In a letter dated July 13, 1993, the FDA states that, "A  
synthetic drug ... is identical in all respects to the product  
isolated from a plant source.  Such a product can be marketed  
under the same name....  A synthetic drug would be in the same  
schedule as its naturally occurring twin."  Letter from the FDA,  
July 13, 1993 [App., p. 16].  
	Clearly, delta-9-THC itself was approved for medical use by  
the FDA when it approved Marinol.  "[T]he [DEA] does not have the  
authority to impose Schedule I controls on a drug which has been  
approved by the [FDA] for medical use."  Grinspoon, 828 F.2d at  
890 (citing, 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 540, 543).  
	When the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations  
moved delta-9-THC from Schedule I to Schedule II of the  
Convention on Psychotropic Substances, it made no distinction  
between synthetic delta-9-THC and delta-9-THC itself.  
	In 1986, then Administrator John C. Lawn improperly took  
upon himself the authority to define synthetic delta-9-THC and  
delta-9-THC itself as two separate substances under the CSA.  
	In the course of rescheduling synthetic dronabinol to  
Schedule II of the CSA, the original proposal submitted by the  
DEA defined it as "the principle psychoactive substance in  
Cannabis sativa L., marijuana," 50 Fed. Reg. 42,185 (October 18,  
1985) (proposed rule), but this definition was changed to "the  
synthetic equivalent of the isomer of delta-9- 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is the principle psychoactive  
substance in Cannabis sativa L., marijuana" in the final rule, 51  
Fed. Reg. 17,476 (May 13, 1986) (final rule).  Whether this  
change was accidental or intentional is hard to discern, but it  
clearly exceeded the Administrator's authority.  
	Although it is true that "[a]ppellate courts have neither  
the expertise nor the resources to evaluate complex scientific  
claims," this is not a complex scientific claim.  Grinspoon, 828  
F.2d at 896 (citing, Thompson Medical Co. v. FTC, 791 F.2d 189,  
196 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).  A synthetic drug must be the same as the  
naturally occurring twin before it can receive FDA marketing  
approval for distribution in interstate commerce.  As a matter of  
law, delta-9-THC itself was rescheduled to Schedule II of the CSA  
at the same time as synthetic delta-9-THC, and this Court should  
so find.  
	2.	MARIJUANA IS IN SAME SCHEDULE AS DELTA-9-THC.  
	As this Court noted in 1991, "As is apparent, one salient  
concept distinguishing the two schedules is whether a drug has  
'no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United  
States.'"  ACT v. DEA, 930 F.2d at 938.  "However, placement in  
Schedule I does not appear to flow inevitably from lack of  
currently accepted medical use."  NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d at 748.   
"The legislative history of the CSA indicates that medical use is  
but one factor to be considered, and by no means the most  
important one."  Id.  
	Moreover, DEA's own scheduling practices support the  
conclusion that substances lacking medical usefulness need not  
always be placed in Schedule I.  At the hearing before ALJ Parker  
DEA's Chief Counsel, Donald Miller, testified that several  
substances listed in CSA Schedule II, including poppy straw, have  
no currently accepted medical use.  Tr. at 473-474, 488.  He  
further acknowledged that marihuana could be rescheduled to  
Schedule II without a currently accepted medical use.  Tr. at  
487-488.  Neither party offered any contrary evidence.    
Id.  
	The explanation given by the Administrator for the placement  
of coca and opium poppy plants in Schedule II is that coca and  
opium poppy plants have been "recognized as the source for a  
variety of accepted and useful medications."  Petition, Exhibit  
A.  According to this explanation, marijuana should be  
transferred to Schedule II, because it has now become the source  
of an accepted and useful medication, after its initial placement  
in Schedule I of the CSA in 1970.  
	In the final order under review in this case, the  
Administrator stated that, "Since I am not accepting your  
petition on the grounds that dronabinol is a wholly synthetic  
substance, not obtained from marijuana, it is unnecessary for me  
to consider the broader question of whether the rescheduling of  
marijuana would be appropriate if accepted medications were  
indeed obtained from that source."  Final Order, October 23,  
1992.  
	Again, the standard of review is that of Chevron, 467 U.S.  
837.  It is apparent from reading the CSA that Congress intended  
to include coca and opium poppy plants in Schedule II because  
useful medications were being derived from these plant sources  
when the CSA was created in 1970.  The apparent distinction that  
Congress made between marijuana and coca and opium poppy plants  
when the schedules were created in 1970 was that coca and opium  
poppy plants were the sources of useful and accepted medications,  
while marijuana was not.  The Administrator has provided his  
interpretation of the statute by stating "Congress was very much  
aware that these plant materials [coca and opium poppy] have  
historically been recognized as the source for a variety of  
accepted and useful medications."  Petition, Exhibit A.  
	The Administrator's interpretation reinforces what is  
apparent from the face of the statute, that plants which are the  
source of accepted and useful medications cannot be placed in a  
schedule higher than Schedule II.  For example, peyote, a plant  
which contains the Schedule I drug mescaline, is also in Schedule  
I, while opium poppy, a plant which contains the Schedule II drug  
morphine, is in Schedule II.  
	To quote the Administrator, "Those who insist marijuana has  
medical uses would serve society better by promoting or  
sponsoring more legitimate scientific research, rather than  
throwing their time, money and rhetoric into lobbying, public  
relations campaigns and perennial litigation."  57 Fed. Reg. at  
10,503.  Since marijuana belongs in Schedule II of the CSA, the  
DEA should not even be involved in the debate on marijuana's  
medical use.  Congress intended the FDA to handle this debate.   
Scientific research will be promoted by treating marijuana  
exactly the same as coca and opium poppy plants, the DEA will be  
removed from the debate on marijuana's medical use, clearing the  
way for the FDA to take over, and needless perennial litigation  
will cease.  
	Since accessibility for research purposes is exactly the  
same under either Schedule I or Schedule II, there is no reason  
for the DEA not to move marijuana into Schedule II, since DEA's  
only legitimate concern under the CSA is drug diversion.   
"Congress was particularly concerned with the diversion of drugs  
from legitimate channels to illegitimate channels."  United  
States v. Moore, 423 U.S. 122, 135 (1972).  
	3.	THE PETITION MUST BE ACCEPTED BEFORE IT IS DENIED.  
	Another question presented is whether the Administrator  
followed proper procedure in refusing to accept the petition by  
denying the petition on its merits.  Pursuant to 21 C.F.R.   
1308.44(c):  
	Within a reasonable period of time after the receipt of a  
petition, the Administrator shall notify the petitioner of his  
acceptance or nonacceptance of the petition, and if not accepted,  
the reason therefor.  The Administrator need not accept a  
petition for filing if any of the requirements prescribed in  
paragraph (b) of this section is lacking or is not set forth so  
as to be readily understood.  If the petitioner desires, he may  
amend the petition to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of  
this section.  If accepted for filing, a petition may be denied  
by the Administrator within a reasonable period of time  
thereafter if he finds the grounds upon which the petitioner  
relies are not sufficient to justify the initiation of  
proceedings.  
The Administrator's streamlined procedure in this case appears to  
be in conflict with DEA regulations.  This Court dealt with a  
similar procedural question in 1974:   
[T]he rejection of a filing is a "peremptory" response "which  
classically is used not to dispose of a matter on the merits but  
rather as a technique for calling on the filing party to put its  
papers in proper form and order.  Its use is not limited to  
defects of form.  It may be used by an agency where the filing is  
so patently a nullity as a matter of substantive law, that  
administrative efficiency and justice are furthered by obviating  
any docket at the threshold rather than opening a futile docket."   
146 U.S.App.D.C. at 299, 450 F.2d at 1346.  
NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d at 659 n.10.  My petition was not  
such a patent nullity, as matter of law, to justify either  
refusal to accept the petition for filing, or denial of the  
petition on its merits.  I was denied the opportunity to present  
additional evidence to support my petition, and I am objecting to  
this streamlined approach.  
CONCLUSION  
  	Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request this Court to  
rule that: (1) as a matter of law, delta-9-THC itself is in  
Schedule II of the CSA; (2) as a matter of law, marijuana is in  
Schedule II of the CSA; and (3) such other or further relief be  
granted as this Court may deem necessary under the circumstances.

I.   Whether the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement 
     Administration erred in ruling that marijuana must have an 
     accepted medical use in treatment in the United States 
     before it can be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II 
     of the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  


II.  Whether the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement 
     Administration erred in ruling that only synthetic 
     dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin 
     capsules, not dronabinol itself, was transferred to Schedule 
     II of the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970.


III. Whether the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement 
     Administration erred by ruling that marijuana is not the 
     source of a Schedule II controlled substance under the 
     federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970.


IV.  Whether the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement 
     Administration erred by ruling that the scheduling of 
     dronabinol is irrelevant to the scheduling of marijuana 
     under the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970. 


                    <B>STATUTES AND REGULATIONS</B>

     The pertinent statues and regulations are set forth in an 

addendum bound with this brief.


                          <B>JURISDICTION</B>

     The final order of the Drug Enforcement Administration was 

issued on May 16, 1994 [App., p. 17].  I received the final order 

by mail on May 19, 1994.  My Petition for Review, with attached 

Motion to Proceed in Forma Pauperis, was filed by this Court on 

June 17, 1994, and assigned Docket No. 94-8015.  My Motion to 

Proceed in Forma Pauperis was subsequently denied, and my 

Petition for Review was refiled by this Court on September 16, 


                              - 1 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>1994, and reassigned Docket No. 94-1605.  This Court has 

jurisdiction of this petition for review of a final order of the 

Drug Enforcement Administration pursuant to 21 U.S.C.  877.


                      <B>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</B>

     1.   THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.

     In 1970 Congress enacted the Controlled Substances Act 

(CSA), a comprehensive statute designed to rationalize federal 

control of dangerous drugs.  The Act contains five categories of 

controlled substances, designated as Schedules I through V and 

defined in terms of dangers and benefits.  21 U.S.C.  812(b)(1)-

(5).  The control mechanisms imposed on manufacture, acquisition, 

and distribution of substances listed under the Act vary 

according to the schedule in which the substance is contained.  

Substances in Schedules I & II are subject to the most severe 

restrictions, and substances in Schedule V are subject to the 

least severe restrictions.  In drafting the CSA Congress placed 

marijuana in Schedule I, one of two classifications that provide 

for the most severe restrictions (the other is Schedule II).

     Recognizing that the results of continuous research might 

cast doubt on the wisdom of initial classification assignments, 

Congress created a procedure by which changes in scheduling could 

be effected.  Pursuant to Section 201(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C.  

811(a), the Attorney General "may, by rule," add a substance to a 

schedule, transfer it between schedules, or remove it from the 

schedules.  A reclassification rule promulgated under this 

section must be made on the record after opportunity for hearing, 


                              - 2 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>in accordance with the rulemaking procedures prescribed by the 

Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. ch. 5, subch. II.  Section 

201(a) further provides that rescheduling proceedings may be 

initiated by the Attorney General on his [or her] own motion, at 

the request of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), 

or, as in the present case, on petition of any interested party.

     Section 501(a) of the CSA, 21 U.S.C.  871(a), authorizes 

the Attorney General to "delegate any of his functions under this 

subchapter to any officer or employee of the Department of 

Justice."  The functions vested in the Attorney General by the 

CSA have been delegated to the Administrator of the Drug 

Enforcement Administration (DEA) pursuant to 28 C.F.R.  

0.100(b) & 0.132(d).

     DEA's Acting Administrator must share his [or her] decision-

making function under the Act with the Secretary of HHS.  Section 

201(b), 21 U.S.C.  811(b), provides that, prior to commencement 

of reclassification rulemaking proceedings, the Attorney General 

must "request from the Secretary a scientific and medical 

evaluation, and his [or her] recommendations, as to whether such 

drug or other substance should be so controlled or removed as a 

controlled substance."  The evaluation prepared by the Secretary 

must address the scientific and medical factors enumerated in 

Section 201(c), 21 U.S.C.  811(c); these factors relate to the 

effects of the drug and its abuse potential.  Pursuant to Section 

201(b), the Secretary's recommendations "shall be binding on the 

Attorney General as to such scientific and medical matters, and 

if the Secretary recommends that a drug or other substance not be 


                              - 3 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>controlled, the Attorney General shall not control the drug or 

other substance."

     Section 201(d) of the Act, 21 U.S.C.  811(d), contains a 

limited exception to the referral procedures detailed in Section 

201(b)-(c).  Subsection (d)(1) provides:

          If control is required by United States obligations 
     under international treaties, conventions, or protocols in 
     effect on October 27, 1970, the Attorney General shall issue 
     an order controlling such drug under the schedule he [or 
     she] deems most appropriate to carry out such obligations, 
     without regard to the findings required by subsection (a) of 
     this section or section 812(b) of this title and without 
     regard to the procedures prescribed by sections (a) and (b) 
     of this section.


     2.   THE SINGLE CONVENTION ON NARCOTIC DRUGS.

     In 1948, in order to simplify existing treaties and 

international administrative machinery, members of the United 

Nations undertook codification of a single convention on 

international narcotics control.  In 1961, after three 

preliminary drafts, the <I>Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs,</I> 

<I>1961</I>, 18 U.S.T. 1407 (1967), 520 U.N.T.S. 204 (1964), was opened 

for signature.  The United States ratified the <I>Single Convention</I> 

in 1967 -- three years prior to enactment of the CSA.

     Like the CSA, the <I>Single Convention</I> establishes several 

classifications or "schedules" of substances, to which varying 

regimes of control attach.  Schedule I of the <I>Single Convention</I> 

contains substances considered to carry a relatively high abuse 

liability; included in this category are heroin, methadone, 

opium, coca leaf, and cocaine.  Schedule II and III contain those 


                              - 4 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>substances regarded as less susceptible to abuse.  Finally, 

Schedule IV of the <I>Single Convention</I> -- unlike CSA schedule IV -- 

embraces certain Schedule I substances, such as heroin, the abuse 

liability of which is not offset by substantial therapeutic 

advantages.  Marijuana (cannabis) is listed in Schedules I and IV 

of the <I>Single Convention</I>.  However, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 

(delta-9-THC) is not listed in the schedules of the <I>Single</I> 

<I>Convention</I>.


     3.   THE CONVENTION ON PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES.

     In 1978 Congress enacted the <I>Psychotropic Substances Act</I> 

(PSA), Pub. L. 95-633, Nov. 10, 1978, 92 Stat. 2768, to coincide 

with the <I>Convention on Psychotropic Substances</I>, signed at Vienna, 

Austria on February 21, 1971 [The Convention entered into force 

in respect to the United States on July 15, 1980], 1019 U.N.T.S. 

175 (1976), Treaty No. 14,596.  Section 101 of the PSA, 21 U.S.C. 

 801a, provides, in part:

          The United States has joined with other countries in 
     executing an international treaty, entitled the Convention 
     on Psychotropic Substances and signed at Vienna, Austria, on 
     February 21, 1971, which is designed to establish suitable 
     controls over the manufacture, distribution, transfer, and 
     use of certain psychotropic substances.

     The <I>Convention on Psychotropic Substances</I> contains four 

categories of controlled substances, designated as Schedules I 

through IV and defined in terms of dangers and benefits.  The 

international control mechanisms imposed on manufacture, 

acquisition, and distribution of substances listed under the 

<I>Convention on Psychotropic Substances</I> vary according to the 


                              - 5 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>schedule in which the substance is contained.  Substances in 

Schedule I are subject to the most severe restrictions, and 

substances in Schedule IV are subject to the least severe 

restrictions.

     In drafting the <I>Convention on Psychotropic Substances</I> the 

parties placed tetrahydrocannabinols in Schedule I, the 

classification that provides for the most severe restrictions.  

     However, "At its 1,045th meeting, on April 29, 1991, the 

Commission on Narcotic Drugs, in accordance with article 2, 

paragraphs 5 and 6, of the <I>Convention on Psychotropic Substances</I>, 

1971, decided, by a vote of 33 in favor and 5 against, with no 

abstentions, that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (also referred to 

as delta-9-THC) and its stereochemical variants should be 

transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of that Convention."  

Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 1991, 

Supplement No. 4 (E/1991/24, Supp. No. 4), pp. 23 and 98 [App., 

p. 10].  The five States voting against the decision were 

Colombia, Ivory Coast, Egypt, France and Pakistan.  Id.


     4.   HISTORY OF THIS CASE.

     The scheduling of marijuana under the Controlled Substances 

Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C.  812, as well as under international 

obligations, has been considered by this Court on several prior 

occasions.  <I>NORML v. Ingersoll</I>, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974); 

<I>NORML v. DEA</I>, 559 F.2d 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977); <I>ACT v. DEA</I>, 930 F.2d 

936 (D.C. Cir. 1991); and <I>ACT v. DEA</I>, 15 F.3d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 

1994).


                             - 6 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>     All of these cases originated from one petition filed with 

the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) on May 18, 

1972.  NORML filed the petition seeking to have marijuana removed 

from the CSA.  The BNDD refused to accept the petition for 

filing, and this Court then ordered the DEA to accept the 

petition and respond.  <I>NORML v. Ingersoll</I>, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. 

Cir. 1974).  Upon remand the DEA held that international treaty 

obligations required it to place marijuana in Schedule I of the 

CSA.  This Court then remanded the petition back to the DEA 

again, holding that marijuana can be placed in either Schedule I 

or Schedule II of the CSA without violating international treaty 

obligations, and requiring the DEA to hold hearings to determine 

in which of the two schedules, Schedule I or Schedule II, 

marijuana properly belonged.  <I>NORML v. DEA</I>, 559 F.2d 735, 757 

(D.C. Cir. 1977).

     As the issue became more narrowly focused, the Alliance for 

Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT) became the lead petitioner in the 

case.  The ACT, and the other parties seeking rescheduling, 

advanced the argument that marijuana has accepted medical use in 

treatment in the United States, 21 U.S.C.  812(b)(2)(B), and 

sought rescheduling solely on that basis.  The DEA administrator 

again denied the petition, listing several criteria for 

determining accepted medical use which marijuana failed to meet, 

and this Court then remanded the case for clarification of the 

DEA administrator's final order.  <I>ACT v. DEA</I>, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C. 

Cir. 1991).  The DEA administrator clarified and affirmed his 

prior ruling in a subsequent final order, issued on March 26, 


                              - 7 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>1992, finding that marijuana does not have accepted medical use 

in treatment in the United States.  57 Fed. Reg. 10,499.  The ACT 

sought review of the March 26, 1992, final order, and this Court 

affirmed the final order of the DEA.  <I>ACT v. DEA</I>, 15 F.3d 1131 

(D.C. Cir. 1994).

     In <I>ACT v. DEA</I>, 15 F.3d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1994), the 

Administrator listed five criteria for determining accepted 

medical use, and found that marijuana failed to satisfy all five 

criteria.  The Administrator said, "First, marijuana's chemistry 

is neither fully known, nor reproducible."  57 Fed. Reg. at 

10,507.  The Administrator's findings that marijuana failed to 

satisfy the remaining four criteria are due to the failure to 

satisfy the first criterion, which would necessarily dictate 

failure to satisfy the remaining four.

     After reading the Administrator's final ruling of March 26, 

1992, 57 Fed. Reg. 10,499, I sent a letter to the Administrator 

on July 21, 1992 [App., p. 1], asking why coca and opium poppy 

plants are scheduled in Schedule II of the CSA, since both of 

these plants are subject to the same variances in chemistry as 

the marijuana plant and neither are reproducible in standardized 

dosages.

     On August 17, 1992, the Administrator replied [App., p. 5] 

by stating that "these plant materials [coca and opium poppy] 

have historically been recognized as the source for a variety of 

accepted and useful medications."  The Administrator also stated 

that "the petition to reschedule marijuana did not involve the 


                              - 8 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>scheduling of any medically useful compound to be extracted from 

the plant material."

     Interpreting the Administrator's statements regarding the 

scheduling of coca and opium poppy plants as general rules of 

statutory construction, I then filed my own Petition to 

Reschedule Marijuana [App., p. 2] based on the fact dronabinol, 

delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the principle 

psychoactive substance in the marijuana plant, was rescheduled to 

Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act in 1986, and, 

therefore, because marijuana is the source of dronabinol, it must 

be moved into the same schedule as dronabinol.  See Final Order 

of the Drug Enforcement Administration, May 13, 1986, 51 Fed. 

Reg. 17,476 (placing dronabinol in Schedule II).

     My petition was filed on September 11, 1992, pursuant to 21 

U.S.C.  811 and 21 C.F.R.  1307.03, in the form prescribed by 

21 C.F.R.  1308.44(b).

      In his final order of May 16, 1994, the Deputy 

Administrator responded to my petition [App., p. 23] by stating, 

"Only the pharmaceutical product was transferred from Schedule I 

to Schedule II, i.e., 'dronabinol (synthetic) in sesame oil and 

encapulated in a soft gelatin capsule in a U.S. Food and Drug 

Administration approved drug product.'  No rescheduling action 

was taken with regard to (-) delta-9-trans-THC, i.e., dronabinol, 

which remains in Schedule I of the CSA."

     The Deputy Administrator further stated [App., p. 24], 

"Under the CSA, the regulation of chemicals and the plant 

material are distinct from each other.  The classification of 


                              - 9 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>delta-9-THC has no bearing on the classification of marijuana.  

Under the CSA, a proposed change in the schedule of either a 

tetrahydrocannabinol or the plant marijuana requires the Attorney 

General to proceed independently."  <I>Id</I>.


                       <B>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</B>

     By definition, a synthetic drug is the same as its natural 

occurring twin.  Dronabinol is only one substance, not two.  

Synthesizing, adding sesame oil and encapsulating in soft gelatin 

capsules, while having significance to the Food and Drug 

Administration (FDA) for marketing purposes, does not make 

dronabinol into another drug for scheduling purposes.  In 1986, 

Health and Human Services (HHS) recognized that synthetic delta-

9-THC is the same as its naturally occurring twin [App., p. 8].  

The DEA must accept the scientific and medical findings of HHS.

     The DEA is trying to do something with delta-9-THC that it 

doesn't do with any other drug, placing the synthetic drug in a 

different schedule than its naturally occurring twin.  The DEA is 

not authorized to make such distinctions.  The DEA must defer to 

HHS for scientific and medical findings regarding the structure 

of a drug.

     The DEA cannot rely on FDA marketing approval of  Marinol&reg; 

(synthetic dronabinol "in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft 

gelatin capsules"), as a reason for keeping the dronabinol found 

in the marijuana plant in Schedule I.  Sesame oil and gelatin 

capsules are simply foods, which are not subject to control under

<PRE>the CSA.  It is dronabinol which is in Schedule II, not just the 

FDA approved product Marinol&reg;.

     In 1986, when marijuana became the source of an accepted and 

useful medication, dronabinol, it should have been transferred 

into the same schedule of the CSA, Schedule II, as the other 

plants, coca and opium, which are the sources of the accepted and 

useful Schedule II medications cocaine and morphine.  It would be 

illogical for the DEA to place a plant in a higher schedule than 

the drug which caused it to be scheduled in the first place, 

especially when there is no difference between Schedule I and 

Schedule II with regard to enforcement of the drug laws (the 

DEA's only valid concern).


                            <B>ARGUMENT</B>

     1.   SYNTHETIC AND NATURAL DELTA-9-THC ARE THE SAME.

     The Administrator's decision that synthetic dronabinol in 

sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules, but not 

dronabinol itself, has been rescheduled, and that dronabinol is 

not obtained from marijuana, is beyond the scope of the DEA's 

authority.  This distinction is strictly a function of the Food 

and Drug Administration, and only with regard to the marketing of 

a drug, not its scheduling.

     In enacting the CSA, "Members of the House repeatedly stated 

that the Department of Justice should make judgments based on law 

enforcement considerations, while HEW should have the final say 

with respect to medical and scientific determinations."  <I>NORML v.</I> 

<I>DEA</I>, 559 F.2d at 746.  The Department of Justice "may not 


                             - 11 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>schedule a substance under the CSA without first obtaining the 

recommendation of the FDA, through its parent agency, HHS, 21 

U.S.C.  811(b), and providing an 'opportunity for a hearing 

pursuant to rulemaking procedures prescribed by [the 

Administrative Procedures Act].' 21 U.S.C.  811(a)."  <I>Grinspoon</I> 

<I>v. DEA</I>, 828 F.2d 881, 890 (1st Cir. 1987).  "This request is 

filed with the Commissioner of FDA, who has the responsibility 

for coordination of activities within [HHS]."  <I>NORML v. DEA</I>, 559 

F.2d at 749 n.59.

     As this Court stated in 1977:

          Our interpretation of Section 201(d) ensures proper 
     allocation of decisionmaking responsibility between the 
     Attorney General and the Secretary of HEW, in accordance 
     with their respective spheres of expertise.  Section 201(d) 
     directs the Attorney General, as an initial matter, to make 
     a legal judgment as to controls necessitated by 
     international commitments.  He then establishes a minimum 
     schedule or level of control below which placement of the 
     substance may not fall.  Determination of a minimum schedule 
     ensures that the Secretary's recommendation, which 
     ordinarily would be binding as to medical and scientific 
     findings, does not cause a substance to be scheduled in 
     violation of treaty obligations.  However, once that minimum 
     schedule is established by the Attorney General, the 
     decision whether to impose controls more restrictive than 
     required by treaty implicates the same medical and 
     scientific considerations as do scheduling decisions 
     regarding those few substances not controlled by treaty.  
     The Secretary of HEW is manifestly more competent to make 
     these nonlegal evaluations and recommendations.

<I>NORML v. DEA</I>, 559 F.2d at 747.

     Although the FDA has approved a New Drug Application (NDA) 

for Marinol&reg; (synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil and 

encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules), this does not qualify as 

a recommendation, pursuant to 21 U.S.C.  811(b), to keep the 


                             - 12 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>dronabinol found in the marijuana plant in Schedule I.  FDA did 

not recommended that the dronabinol found in marijuana remain in 

Schedule I when Marinol&reg; was placed in Schedule II, nor did it 

say that synthetic dronabinol was superior to the dronabinol 

found in marijuana.  [App., p. 15]

     This is not the first time the DEA has tried to follow 

verbatim text of FDA marketing approval for a New Drug 

Application (NDA) in making a scheduling determination.  As this 

Court stated in 1991:

     The First Circuit in Grinspoon v. Drug Enforcement 
     Administration, 828 F.2d 881, 891-92 (1st Cir. 1987), upon 
     which petitioners rely, had held that earlier criteria the 
     Administrator had employed to define "currently accepted 
     medical use" were contrary to the statute because they were 
     a carbon copy of those used by the FDA in licensing new 
     drugs.  The present criteria, it is argued, duplicate a 
     number of those original criteria.  But the criteria 
     challenged in Grinspoon included several elements, such as 
     the availability of patent information or FDA-required 
     labeling, which were necessary only to market the drug in 
     interstate commerce.  These criteria are clearly relevant to 
     the FDA's mission, but not the DEA's, see Grinspoon, 828 
     F.2d at 887.  The First Circuit never suggested the DEA 
     Administrator was foreclosed from incorporating and relying 
     on those standards employed by the FDA that are relevant to 
     the pharmaceutical qualities of the drug.  The court merely 
     held that while FDA approval is sufficient to establish the 
     existence of an accepted medical use, the converse is not 
     true -- that absent FDA approval, commonly accepted medical 
     use cannot be proven.  Id. at 890.  Nor can we conceive of a 
     reason the Administrator should be barred from employing 
     notions developed by a sister agency insofar as those 
     notions serve the missions of both agencies.

<I>ACT v. DEA</I>, 930 F.2d at 939-40.  

     In 1987, the First Circuit said, 

     [W]e find no necessary linkage between failure to obtain FDA 
     interstate marketing approval and a determination that the 
     substance in question is unsafe and has no medical use.  
     Indeed, the FDCA does not even mention the term 'medical 


                             - 13 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>     use.'  In short, it is plainly possible that a substance may 
     fail to obtain interstate marketing approval even if it has 
     an accepted medical use.  

<I>Grinspoon</I>, 828 F.2d at  887.  "Thus, it is possible that a 

substance may have both an accepted medical use and safety for 

use under medical supervision, even though no one has deemed it 

necessary to seek approval for interstate marketing."  <I>Id</I>.

     By definition, a synthetic drug is the same as its naturally 

occurring twin.  Under this Court's order of June 4, 1982, in 

<I>NORML v. DEA</I>, No. 79-1660, the Department of Health and Human 

Services (DHHS) was required to submit reports on the status of 

its recommendations for the scheduling of THC and marijuana 

plants.  In reference to the DEA's rescheduling order of May 13, 

1986 (51 Fed. Reg. 17,476) the DHHS stated that, "Dronabinol is 

structurally the same as THC."  [App., p. 8]

     In his final order on NORML's petition, the Administrator 

adopted in their entirety the findings of the former 

Administrator.  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,507.  The former 

Administrator, in his final order on NORML's petition,  stated, 

"There is no difference in the pharmacological effect between the 

THC isolated from cannabis and the synthetically produced THC 

which is now marketed in the United States."  54 Fed. Reg. at 

53,774.  As this Court noted in 1991, "The First Circuit never 

suggested the DEA Administrator was foreclosed from incorporating 

and relying on those standards employed by the FDA that are 

relevant to the pharmaceutical qualities of the drug."  <I>ACT v.</I> 

<I>DEA</I>, 930 F.2d at 939.  The former Administrator, in agreement 

with HHS, recognized that the pharmaceutical qualities of 


                             - 14 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>synthetic dronabinol are the same as those of the dronabinol 

found in marijuana.

     In his final order of March 26, 1992, the Administrator 

stated, "There are scientific studies showing pure THC (Delta-9-

Tetrahydrocannabinol), one of the many chemicals found in 

marijuana, has some effect in controlling nausea and vomiting.  

Pure THC is pharmaceutically made in clean capsule form, called 

Marinol, and is available for use by the medical community.  More 

information on Marinol can be found in the 'Physicians' Desk 

Reference,' available in most libraries."  57 Fed. Reg. at 

10,500.  The <I>1993 Physician's Desk Reference</I> describes Marinol as 

follows: "Dronabinol, commonly known as delta-9-THC, is one of 

the major active substances in marijuana."  <I>Id</I>. at p. 2076.  The 

Physician's Desk Reference makes no distinction between synthetic 

dronabinol and the dronabinol found in marijuana.

     In a letter dated July 13, 1993, the FDA states that, "A 

synthetic drug ... is identical in all respects to the product 

isolated from a plant source.  Such a product can be marketed 

under the same name....  A synthetic drug would be in the same 

schedule as its naturally occurring twin."  Letter from the FDA, 

July 13, 1993 [App., p. 16].

     Clearly, the dronabinol found in marijuana was approved for 

medical use by the FDA when it approved Marinol&reg;.  "[T]he [DEA] 

does not have the authority to impose Schedule I controls on a 

drug which has been approved by the [FDA] for medical use."  

<I>Grinspoon</I>, 828 F.2d at 890 (<I>citing</I>, 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. 

News 540, 543).


                             - 15 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>     When the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations 

moved delta-9-THC from Schedule I to Schedule II of the 

<I>Convention on Psychotropic Substances</I>, it made no distinction 

between synthetic delta-9-THC and delta-9-THC found in marijuana.

     In 1986, then Administrator John C. Lawn improperly took 

upon himself the authority to define synthetic dronabinol and 

dronabinol found in marijuana as two separate and distinct 

substances under the CSA.  51 Fed Reg. 17476 (1986).

     In the course of rescheduling synthetic dronabinol to 

Schedule II of the CSA, the original proposal submitted by the 

DEA defined it as "the principle psychoactive substance in 

Cannabis sativa L., marijuana," 50 Fed. Reg. 42,185 (October 18, 

1985) (proposed rule), but this definition was changed to "the 

synthetic equivalent of the isomer of delta-9-

tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is the principle psychoactive 

substance in <I>Cannabis sativa</I> L., marijuana" in the final rule, 51 

Fed. Reg. 17,476 (May 13, 1986) (final rule).  Whether this 

change was accidental or intentional is hard to discern, but it 

clearly exceeded the Administrator's authority.

     Although it is true that "[a]ppellate courts have neither 

the expertise nor the resources to evaluate complex scientific 

claims," this is not a complex scientific claim.  <I>Grinspoon</I>, 828 

F.2d at 896 (<I>citing, Thompson Medical Co. v. FTC</I>, 791 F.2d 189, 

196 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).  A synthetic drug must first be the same 

as its naturally occurring twin before it can receive FDA 

marketing approval for distribution in interstate commerce.  As a 

matter of law, the dronabinol found in marijuana was rescheduled 


                             - 16 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>to Schedule II of the CSA at the same time as synthetic 

dronabinol.


     2.   MARIJUANA IS IN THE SAME SCHEDULE AS DELTA-9-THC.

     As this Court noted in 1991, "As is apparent, one salient 

concept distinguishing the two schedules is whether a drug has 

'no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United 

States.'"  <I>ACT v. DEA</I>, 930 F.2d at 938.  It is important to note 

that medical use is not the only salient concept.  As this Court 

noted in 1977, "However, placement in Schedule I does not appear 

to flow inevitably from lack of currently accepted medical use."  

<I>NORML v. DEA</I>, 559 F.2d at 748.  "The legislative history of the 

CSA indicates that medical use is but one factor to be 

considered, and by no means the most important one."  <I>Id</I>.

          Moreover, DEA's own scheduling practices support the 
     conclusion that substances lacking medical usefulness need 
     not always be placed in Schedule I.  At the hearing before 
     ALJ Parker DEA's Chief Counsel, Donald Miller, testified 
     that several substances listed in CSA Schedule II, including 
     poppy straw, have no currently accepted medical use.  Tr. at 
     473-474, 488.  He further acknowledged that marihuana could 
     be rescheduled to Schedule II without a currently accepted 
     medical use.  Tr. at 487-488.  Neither party offered any 
     contrary evidence.  

<I>Id</I>.

     This Court must review the DEA's final order not to transfer 

marijuana to Schedule II in light of the guidelines set forth by 

the Supreme Court in <I>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources</I> 

<I>Defense Council, Inc.</I>, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 

694 (1984).  In <I>Chevron</I>, the Court explained that a reviewing 


                             - 17 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>court must employ a two-step analysis that focuses initially on 

the intentions of Congress:

     First, always, is the question whether Congress had directly 
     spoken to the precise question at issue.  If the intent of 
     Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the 
     court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the 
     unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.

<I>Id</I>. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781 (emphasis supplied).  In the 

absence of congressional intent, however, the court must proceed 

to a second inquiry:

     If ... the court determines Congress has not directly 
     addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not 
     simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would 
     be necessary in the absence of an administrative 
     interpretation.  Rather, if the statute is silent or 
     ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question 
     for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a 
     permissible construction of the statute.

<I>Id</I>. at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-82 (footnote omitted; emphasis 

supplied).

     In this matter, the agency has interpreted the construction 

of the statute at issue.  The explanation given by the 

Administrator for the placement of coca and opium poppy plants in 

Schedule II is that Congress recognized coca and opium poppy 

plants "as the source for a variety of accepted and useful 

medications."  [App., p. 5].  According to this explanation, 

marijuana should have been transferred to Schedule II when it 

became the source of an accepted and useful medication.  The U.S. 

Congress provided a mechanism for transferring marijuana to 

Schedule II (or lower), after its initial placement of marijuana 

in Schedule I of the CSA in 1970, and the DEA's interpretation of 

the statute is reasonable.


                             - 18 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>     It is apparent from reading the CSA that Congress intended 

to include coca and opium poppy plants in Schedule II because 

useful medications were being derived from these plant sources 

when the CSA was created in 1970.  The apparent distinction that 

Congress made between marijuana and coca and opium poppy plants, 

when the schedules were created in 1970, was that coca and opium 

poppy plants were the sources of useful and accepted medications, 

while marijuana was not.  The Administrator has provided his 

interpretation of the statute by stating "Congress was very much 

aware that these plant materials [coca and opium poppy] have 

historically been recognized as the source for a variety of 

accepted and useful medications."  [App., p. 5].

     The Administrator's interpretation reinforces what is 

apparent from the face of the statute, that plants which are the 

source of accepted and useful medications are placed in the same 

schedule as the drugs themselves.  For example, peyote, a plant 

which contains the Schedule I drug mescaline, is also in Schedule 

I, while opium poppy, a plant which contains the Schedule II drug 

morphine, is in Schedule II.

     Since control for enforcement purposes is exactly the same 

under either Schedule I or Schedule II, there is no reason for 

the DEA not to move marijuana into Schedule II, since DEA's only 

legitimate concern under the CSA is drug diversion.  "Congress 

was particularly concerned with the diversion of drugs from 

legitimate channels to illegitimate channels."  <I>United States v.</I> 

<I>Moore</I>, 423 U.S. 122, 135 (1972).


                             - 19 -
<HR WIDTH=520 ALIGN=Left>     In his final ruling of May 16, 1994, the DEA Deputy 

Administrator said, "Whether or not marijuana is a source of 

delta-9-THC is irrelevant to the status of marijuana under the 

CSA."  Final Order, p. 4 [App., p. 20].  In 1975, the United 

States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit gave 

detailed consideration to this question in the case of <I>United</I> 

<I>States v. Walton</I>, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C. Cir. 1975).  The court said, 

"Looking at the history of this latter law [the Marijuana Tax Act 

of 1937], we find that the definition of marijuana was intended 

to include those parts of marijuana which contain THC and to 

exclude those parts which do not."  <I>Id</I>. 514 F.2d at 203.  "The 

legislative history is absolutely clear that Congress meant to 

outlaw all plants popularly known as marijuana to the extent 

those plants possessed THC."  <I>Id</I>. 514 F.2d at 203-204.  Although 

the Deputy Administrator said, "The classification of delta-9-THC 

has no bearing on the classification of marijuana," [Final Order 

of May 16, 1994, p. 8; App., p. 24], this Court has already ruled 

otherwise.


                              <B>CONCLUSION</B>

       Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request this Court to 

rule that: (1) as a matter of law, the dronabinol found in 

marijuana is in Schedule II of the CSA; (2) as a matter of law, 

marijuana is in Schedule II of the CSA; and (3) such other or 

further relief be granted as this Court may deem necessary under 

the circumstances.

U.S.C.C.A.N. 4566, 4577-4578.  Congress also sought the advice of

the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare ("HEW") before

making a scheduling determination for marihuana.<A HREF="#7">7</A>  After

considering this information, Congress placed marihuana in

     <A NAME="6">6</A>    The House Report on the CSA contains several pages of
discussion about the proper treatment of marihuana under the CSA.
The House Report noted that:

     The extent to which marihuana should be controlled is a
     subject upon which opinions diverge widely.  There are
     some who not only advocate its legalization but would
     encourage its use; at the other extreme there are some
     States which have established the death penalty for
     distribution of marihuana to minors.

     <A NAME="7">7</A>    The Assistant Secretary for Health and scientific
Affairs wrote to Chairman Harley 0. Staggers that:

     Some question has been raised whether the use of the
     plant itself produces "severe psychological or physical
     dependence" as required by a schedule I or even
     schedule II criterion.  Since there is still a
     considerable void in our knowledge of the plant and
     effects of the active drug contained in it, our
     recommendation is that marihuana be retained within
     schedule I at least until the completion of certain
     studies now underway to resolve this issue.  If those
     studies make it appropriate for the Attorney General to
     change the placement of marihuana to a different
     schedule, he may do so in accordance with the authority
     provided under section 201 of the bill.

     Since the passage of the CSA, numerous individuals have

attempted to challenge the decision of Congress to place

marihuana in Schedule I as being irrational or unconstitutional.

These challenges have been uniformly rejected by the federal

courts.  See, e.g., <i>United States</i> v. <i>Greene</i>, 892 F.2d 453, 455-

456 (6th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 935 (1990); <i>United</i>

<i>States</i> v. <i>Fogarty</i>, 692 F.2d 542, 547 (8th Cir. 1982), cert.

denied, 460 U.S. 1040 (1983); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Middleton</i>, 690

F.2d 820, 823 (11th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1051

(1983); <i>National Org. for the Reform of Mariiuana Laws</i> v. <i>Bell</i>,

488 F. Supp. 123, 139-141 (D.D.C. 1980) (three judge court).

     In rejecting constitutional challenges to the initial

classification of marihuana, courts frequently have pointed out

that 21 U.S.C. 811(a) provides the Attorney General with the

authority to reclassify marihuana if scientific information later

demonstrates that Schedule I is not the appropriate schedule.

See, e.g., <i>Greene</i>, 892 F.2d at 456; <i>Fogarty</i>, 692 F.2d at 548;

<i>Middleton</i>, 690 F.2d at 823; <i>National Org. for the Reform of</i>

<i>Mariiuana Laws</i>, 488 F. Supp. at 141.  DEA, on behalf of the

Attorney General, recently conducted lengthy proceedings pursuant

to 811(a) and found that marihuana should not be moved from

Schedule I because the plant has no currently accepted medical

use and because it is not safe for use, even under medical

supervision.  These decisions were approved by this court.  See

footnote 2, <i>supra</i>.

                                12
<HR>
<B>III. DEA PROPERLY FOUND THAT THE PETITION WAS NOT SUFFICIENT
     TO JUSTIFY ADDITIONAL RESCHEDULING PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THE
     PETITION WAS PREMISED ON THE INCORRECT BELIEF THAT A
     SCHEDULE I DRUG MUST BE RESCHEDULED IF IT IS THE SOURCE OF
     AN ACCEPTED AND USEFUL MEDICATION.</B>

     In seeking to reschedule marihuana from Schedule I to

Schedule II, the petitioner made a rather creative argument based

upon several flawed premises.  DEA properly detected the flaws in

the petitioner's logic and found that the petition raised no

credible issue that would justify additional proceedings to

reschedule marihuana.

     <B>A.   THE PETITIONER'S ARGUMENT</B>

     The petitioner's argument was based entirely upon his

construction of language contained in then-Administrator Bonner's

response to an earlier letter sent by the petitioner.  In

response to the petitioner's query about why marihuana plants are

in Schedule I while coca leaves and opium plants are in Schedule

II, the Administrator stated that:

     In placing coca leaves and opium plant material in
     Schedule II, Congress was very much aware that these
     plant materials have historically been recognized as
     the source for a variety of accepted and useful
     medications.

A. 5.  The petitioner then seized upon the Administrator's

language as "general rules of statutory construction."  Pet. Br.

9.  Using the newly created rules of statutory construction as

his springboard, the petitioner took an additional logical leap

by inferring that if marihuana were found to be a "source for an

accepted and useful medication," it must be moved from Schedule I

to Schedule II.  A. 3-4.

                                13
<HR>
     Having created a new theory of statutory construction, the

petitioner proceeded to apply it with apparently successful

results.  He noted that a synthetic equivalent of the principal

psychoactive ingredient in marihuana recently had been moved from

Schedule I to Schedule II.  Since marihuana was the source of

this "accepted and useful medication," the petitioner concluded

that marihuana "must now be moved from Schedule I to Schedule II

of the CSA."  A. 4.

     <B>B.   THE CSA DOES NOT MANDATE THAT A SCHEDULE I
          DRUG MUST BE RESCHEDULED IF IT IS THE SOURCE
          OF AN ACCEPTED AND USEFUL MEDICATION BUT
          REQUIRES DEA TO MAKE INDIVIDUAL FINDINGS
          ABOUT A PARTICULAR DRUG PRIOR TO RESCHEDULING
          IT.</B>

     The premise of the petitioner's argument is that if a

Schedule I controlled substance is the source of an accepted and

useful medication, the Schedule I substance must be placed into

the schedule that contains the accepted and usef ul medication.

This premise is in direct conflict with the language of the CSA.

     As discussed previously, Congress itself decided to place

marihuana in Schedule I.  See <i>National Org. for the Reform of</i>

<i>Mariiuana Laws</i>, 488 F. Supp. at 141.  Although marihuana may be

rescheduled:

     [t]he clear meaning of section 812(c) is that Congress
     intended marijuana to remain in Schedule I until such
     time as it might be reclassified by the Attorney
     General on the basis of more complete scientific
     information about the drug.  In such a reclassification
     hearing, the statutory criteria would be the guides to
     determining the most appropriate schedule for
     marijuana.

Id.  Thus, under the CSA, marihuana plants should remain in

                                14
<HR>
Schedule I unless and until more complete information indicates

that placement in a different schedule is more appropriate.

     The CSA's language concerning the rescheduling of a

controlled substance does not suggest that a substance should be

rescheduled merely because it is the source for an accepted and

useful medication.  The CSA states that in order to transfer a

controlled substance from one schedule to another, the Attorney

General must make "with <i>respect to such druct or other substance</i>

the findings prescribed by" 21 U.S.C. 812(b) "for the schedule in

which <i>such drug</i> is to be placed." 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1)(B)

(emphasis added).  Under 812(b), "a drug or other substance may

not be placed in any schedule unless the findings required for

such schedule are made <i>with respect to such drug or other</i>

<i>substance</i>."  21 U.S.C. 812(b) (emphasis added).  Thus, contrary

to the petitioner's representations, the plain language of the

CSA states that in order for DEA to reschedule marihuana plants

from Schedule I to Schedule II, DEA must make the appropriate

findings with respect to <i>marihuana plants</i>.<A HREF="#8">8</A>

     The CSA states that DEA cannot move a drug from Schedule I

to Schedule II unless it finds, <i>inter alia</i>, that the "drug or

other substance" to be rescheduled has a currently accepted

____________________

     <A NAME="8">8</A>Thus, the Deputy Administrator was correct in stating that
"[w]hether or not marijuana is a source of delta-9-THC is
irrelevant to the status of marijuana under the CSA."  A. 20.
Despite the petitioner's assertions, this statement is not
inconsistent with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Walton</i>, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C.
Cir. 1975).  The statement simply indicates that each drug is
evaluated under 21 U.S.C. 812(b) based upon an independent
assessment of its features, not based upon other possible uses of
the chemicals contained within the drug.

                                15
<HR>
medical use.<A HREF="#9">9</A>  21 U.S.C. 812(b)(2)(B).  The CSA's language does

not state or imply that this criterion can be satisfied by a

substance that is the <i>source</i> of a drug with a currently accepted

medical use.  Additionally, the petitioner has produced no

authority to indicate that any controlled substance being

considered for rescheduling ever has been found to have a

currently accepted medical use merely because it was the source

of an "accepted and useful medication."10  Thus, marihuana

____________________

     <A NAME="9">9</A>    There are some instances in which courts have suggested
that the statutory criteria in 21 U.S.C. 812 are not mandatory,
but are factors to be used in a balancing process.  See, e.g.,
<i>Fogarty</i>, 692 F.2d at 548 ("the three statutory criteria for
Schedule I classification set out in S 812(b)(1) - high potential
for abuse, no medically accepted use, and no safe use even under
medical supervision - should not be read as being either
cumulative or exclusive"); <i>National Org. for the Reform of</i>
<i>Mariiuana Laws</i>, 559 F.2d at 748 ("placement in Schedule I does
not appear to flow inevitably from lack of a currently accepted
medical use"); <i>National Org. for the Reform of Mariiuana Laws</i>,
488 F. Supp. at 140 ("statutory criteria of section 812(b)(1) are
guides in determining the schedule to which a drug belongs, but
are not dispositive").  Although the meaning of these dicta is
somewhat unclear, DEA has interpreted the CSA to require that a
controlled substance placed by Congress in Schedule I may not be
rescheduled into Schedule II unless it has a currently accepted
medical use.  See 54 Fed. Reg. at 53,773; 57 Fed. Reg. at 10,499.
Nothing in this court's recent marihuana rescheduling cases
suggests that DEA's interpretation is incorrect.  See <i>Alliance</i>
<i>for Cannabis Therapeutics</i>, 15 F.3d at 1133; <i>Alliance for Cannabis</i>
<i>Therapeutics</i>, 930 F.2d at 938-940.  If there is a tension between
some language in older cases and DEA's interpretation of the CSA,
DEA's reasonable interpretation of the CSA is entitled to
deference under <i>Chevron</i>, 467 U.S. at 843-845.

     <A NAME="10">10</A>   In fact, there is authority to the contrary.  In 1993,
the DEA proposed to reschedule the levo isomer of
alphacetylmethadol while leaving all other isomers of
alphacetylmethadol in Schedule I because the levo isomer had been
approved by the FDA for treatment of narcotic addiction.  See 58
Fed. Reg. 25,790 (1993).  Levo-alphacetylmethadol was
subsequently placed in Schedule II.  See 21 C.F.R.
1308.12(c)(11).  Despite the petitioner's "rules of statutory
construction," alphacetylmethadol (the source of this accepted

                                16
<HR>
plants themselves must have a "currently accepted medical use" in

order to satisfy the rescheduling criterion in 21 U.S.C.

812(b)(2)(B).  Because the petitioner's request raised no doubts

about DEA's recent findings that marihuana plants have no

currently accepted medical use, DEA acted properly when it

declined to initiate proceedings to reschedule marihuana

plants.<A HREF="#11">11</A>

     The petitioner's novel theory that a source of an accepted

and useful medication must be moved out of Schedule I is rooted

in a misinterpretation of the then-Administrator's letter.

Although the letter attempted to explain why Congress may have

chosen to place coca leaves and opium plants in Schedule II,

nothing in the letter states or even suggests that Congress, the

Attorney General, DEA or the courts have adopted a general rule

of statutory construction that whenever a plant is the source of

an accepted and useful medication, it must be rescheduled.

Further, nothing in the letter suggests that its text was

intended to serve as some type of binding administrative

interpretation of the CSA.  The letter was simply an informal

response to a citizen's question about DEA's recent refusal to

and useful medication) remains in Schedule I.  See 21 C.F.R.
1308.11(b)(4).

     <A NAME="11">11</A>   Even if the statutory language were not clear, DEA's
interpretation of the CSA certainly would be permissible.  The
petitioner can point to nothing in the statute, the legislative
history or elsewhere that would suggest that the interpretation
is not reasonable.  Accordingly, even if the CSA is ambiguous,
this court should affirm DEA's interpretation.  See <i>Chevron</i>, 467
U.S. at 843-844.

                                17
<HR>
reschedule marihuana.  Such an informal unpublished letter that

does not even purport to be a final agency action cannot have a

binding effect on DEA.  See <i>Independent Ins, Agents of Am., Inc.</i>

v. <i>Ludwig</i>, 997 F.2d 958, 962 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (finding that six

unpublished letters of Comptroller of the Currency provided no

reliable evidence of Comptroller policy); <i>USAA Fed. Sav. Bank</i> v.

<i>McLaughlin</i>, 849 F.2d 1505, 1508-1509 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (finding

that informal unpublished letter in response to individuals

specific inquiry did not constitute definitive statement of

Department of Labor policy).

     Although there may be some arguable inconsistency between

the scheduling of marihuana plants and the scheduling of coca

leaves and opium plant material, such would not be irrational or

contrary to the CSA.  Congress placed all of these substances in

their CSA schedules.  These scheduling decisions have been upheld

as rational and constitutional.  See, e.g., <i>United States</i> v.

<i>Whitley</i>, 734 F.2d 1129, 1141 (6th Cir. 1984) (not irrational or

unreasonable for Congress to classify cocaine as narcotic

substance under Schedule II of CSA even though cocaine is non-

narcotic central nervous system stimulant); <i>National Org. for the</i>

<i>Reform of Mariluana Laws</i>, 488 F. Supp. at 140 (even if marihuana

does not fall within literal reading of Schedule I,

classification in Schedule I is rational and furthers regulatory

purposes of Congress).  DEA and the courts have conducted reviews

of the scheduling decision and have determined that marihuana

should remain in Schedule I. See <i>Alliance for Cannabis</i>

                                18
<HR>
<i>Therapeutics</i>, 15 F.3d at 1137.  Since the petitioner presented no

new medical, scientific or other information to suggest that

circumstances have changed since DEA's last review, DEA acted

properly when it refused to conduct additional hearings in

response to the petitioner's request to move marihuana from

Schedule I to Schedule II.

<b>IV.  THE ADMINISTRATOR PROPERLY DENIED THE PETITION BECAUSE
     IT RELIED ON THE INCORRECT ASSUMPTION THAT DRONABINOL
     HAS BEEN MOVED TO SCHEDULE II WHEN IN FACT ONLY A
     SINGLE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT HAS BEEN MOVED TO
     SCHEDULE II.</b>

     In addition to relying on a mistaken interpretation of the

CSA, the petitioner also appeared to rely incorrectly upon the

premise that all forms of dronabinol have been rescheduled from

Schedule I to Schedule II.  DEA did not promulgate such a

sweeping rule.  Rather, DEA has merely rescheduled one particular

pharmaceutical product that has been approved by the FDA.

     In May of 1985, the FDA approved a new drug application for

Marinol Capsules, which was submitted by Unimed Incorporated.

Marinol Capsules contain specified quantities of synthetic

dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in round soft gelatin

capsules.  See 50 Fed. Reg. 42,186 (1985).  DEA then issued a

notice of proposed rulemaking seeking to move this pharmaceutical

product (and no other Schedule I substance) to Schedule II.  <i>Id</i>.

After following appropriate rulemaking procedures, on May 13,

1986, the Administrator issued a rule:

     to transfer U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
     approved drug products that consist of synthetic
     dronabinol in sesame oil encapsulated in soft gelatin
     capsules from Schedule I into Schedule II of the

                                19
<HR>
     Controlled Substances Act (CSA).  Dronabinol is the
     synthetic equivalent of the isomer of delta-9-
     tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is the principal
     psychoactive substance in Cannabis sativa L.,
     marijuana.  This action is based on a finding that U.S.
     Food and Drug Administration approved drug products
     which contain dronabinol fit the statutory criteria for
     inclusion in Schedule II of the CSA. . . .  <i>This rule
     does not affect the Schedule I status of any other
     substance, mixture or preparation which is currently
     included in 21-CFR 1308-11(d)(21),
     Tetrahydrocannabinols.</i>

51 Fed. Reg. 17,476 (1986) (emphasis added).

     This rule clearly indicates that only a very specific

substance ("Marinol") was moved from Schedule I to Schedule II.

See 21 C.F.R. 1308.12(f)(1).  DEA did not transfer any other

dronabinol products to Schedule II nor did it transfer all

tetrahydrocannabinols or all cannabis products to Schedule II.

See 51 Fed. Reg. at 17,476 ("Dronabinol and all mixtures,

compounds and preparations thereof, except dronabinol in sesame

oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules in a FDA approved

product, remain in Schedule I").  Thus, marihuana plants and

tetrahydrocannabinols remain listed in Schedule I.  See 21 C.F.R.

1308.11(d)(18) and 1308.11(d)(26).<A HREF="#12">12</A>

     In rejecting the petitioner's request in this case, DEA's

final order correctly explained that dronabinol remains in

Schedule I of the CSA and that only Marinol was placed in

Schedule II in 1986.  A. 23.  Faced with this explanation and the

____________________

     <A NAME="12">12</A>   Unlike Marinol, marijuana plants contain varying
quantities of over 400 chemicals, including THC, that cannot be
reproduced in standardized dosages.  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,507.
Additionally, no currently approved medicine is administered by
smoking.  <i>Id</i>. at 10,499.

                                20
<HR>
clear language of DEA's final rule of 1986, the petitioner has

changed his argument.  He now claims that dronabinol should have

been placed in Schedule II when the pharmaceutical product

Marinol was rescheduled in 1986.  Thus, for the first time on

appeal, the petitioner appears to be challenging the propriety of

the DEA rule that rescheduled Marinol from Schedule I to Schedule

II.<A HREF="#13">13</A>  See 51 Fed. Reg. at 17,476.

     The petitioner did not seek this relief below.  Nothing in

his petition to DEA suggested that he was challenging the

validity of the rescheduling of Marinol.  Similarly, nothing in

the petition suggested that he was petitioning DEA to reschedule

dronabinol or some other substance to Schedule II.  The petition

only asked DEA to reschedule marihuana.  See A. 2-4.  To the

extent that petitioner seeks relief that he did not request in

the proceedings before DEA or challenges the validity of a rule

he did not previously challenge, he should be precluded from

raising these issues for the first time on appeal because he has

failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.  See <i>Cutler</i> v.

<i>Hayes</i>, 818 F.2d 879, 890-891 (D.C. Cir. 1987); <i>Randolph-Sheppard</i>

____________________

     <A NAME="13">13</A>   Contrary to the petitioner's assertions, DEA's actions
in rescheduling Marinol were not in conflict with the holding of
<i>Grinspoon</i> v. <i>Drug Enforcement Admin.</i>, 828 F.2d 881, 891-892 (lst
Cir. 1987).  In <i>Grinspoon</i>, the court specifically found that FDA
approval was sufficient to establish an accepted medical use for
rescheduling determinations under the CSA.  Id. at 890.  Thus,
DEA properly initiated rescheduling proceedings for Marinol after
it received FDA approval.  See 50 Fed. Reg. at 42,186.  Although
the <i>Grinspoon</i> court found that the lack of FDA approval did not
preclude a finding of accepted medical use, DEA was not faced
with such a case; the 1985 petition only sought to reschedule
Marinol, a substance that had been approved by the FDA.

                                21
<HR>
<i>Vendors of America</i> v. <i>Weinberger</i>, 795 F.2d 90, 104-105 (D.C. Cir.

1986).  The court should require the petitioner to exhaust his

administrative remedies on these additional issues because (1) it

is necessary to discourage this prolific petitioner from

frequently and deliberately flouting the administrative process

by raising new issues for the first time on appeal; (2) DEA

should have the first opportunity to consider these issues and

apply its technical expertise in order to protect its autonomy

from judicial intrusion; (3) the record before this court on

these issues is incomplete because the issues were not discussed

in the administrative proceeding; and (4) judicial economy will

be enhanced if the administrative proceedings obviate the need

for judicial involvement.  See <i>Fertilizer Institute</i> v. <i>United</i>

<i>States Envtl. Protection Agency</i>, 935 F.2d 1303, 1312-1313 (D.C.

Cir. 1991); Cutler, 818 F.2d at 890-891.

     The petitioner is free to bring a separate challenge to the

validity of the rulemaking that rescheduled Marinol or to

petition DEA to reschedule dronabinol or some other substance.

However, no purpose would be served by remanding the instant case

to address either challenge.  Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the

petitioner could prevail on either challenge, he could not

achieve the ultimate relief he sought in this proceeding --

rescheduling of marihuana plants -- because the language of the

CSA clearly indicates that the scheduling of other substances has

no bearing on the proper scheduling of marihuana plants.

                                22
<HR>
                            <b>CONCLUSION</b>

     For the foregoing reasons, this court should affirm DEA's

final order denying the petitioner's request.

<p align="center"><font size="6">Marijuana's reasonable medical
uses</font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">An elderly man called CNN's daytime &quot;Oprah&quot;-style
talk show, &quot;Talkback.&quot;&nbsp; The topic: medical uses
for marijuana.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The studio audience, made up of ordinary American folks, listened
quietly as the elderly man's voice wafted over them.&nbsp; He
described his pain and sadness at watching his cancer-stricken
wife suffer through the agonies of chemotherapy.&nbsp; Then he
described how he learned to break a law he thought he would never
break.&nbsp; He went out and shopped for some marijuana.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;I'm 74 years old and I'm a law-abiding citizen.&nbsp; But I
went out on the street and I bought it,&quot; he said.&nbsp; His
soft voice grew raspy with emotion.&nbsp; &quot;And I let my wife
have some comfort before she died.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">With that, the man stopped talking and the audience of ordinary
American folks did something extraordinary.&nbsp; They broke
spontaneously into applause.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">They'd never find a jury in this audience to convict that man, I
thought.&nbsp; It is one thing to oppose medical marijuana in the
abstract.&nbsp; It is quite another to oppose when a real
flesh-and-blood case of suffering and desperation is facing you.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Unfortunately, politicians don't always have to face people with
real flesh-and-blood problems.&nbsp; They only have to face their
political opponents.&nbsp; Perhaps this explains why the Clinton
administration is following its predecessors by turning a blind
eye to common sense.&nbsp; To avoid the possibility of misuse by
a few, the administration acts to prevent pain-relieving,
life-affirming relief for the many.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The same day as the CNN show, White House drug czar Barry
McCaffrey announced the government would revoke the licenses and
even arrest doctors who prescribe marijuana for their patients.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">So much for the November ballot issue in California and Arizona
that decided to allow doctors to recommend the use of marijuana
for pain relief and other medicinal reasons.&nbsp; McCaffrey
denounced those expressions of public sentiments as &quot;a
Cheech and Chong drug policy,&quot; as if voters were just too
ignorant to know what they were getting into.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Instead, McCaffrey defended a sort of &quot;Keystone Kops&quot;
policy -- except it's not funny.&nbsp; It is just pathetic.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Let's get real: Juries will be no more eager to convict a doctor
who offers marijuana to someone suffering from AIDS, cancer,
glaucoma or multiple sclerosis than the Michigan juries that
repeatedly have refused to convict Dr. Jack Kevorkian for
assisting suicides.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Perhaps the most glaring example is the administrative law judge
for the Drug Enforcement Administration who declared in a 69-page
ruling in 1988 that marijuana was &quot;one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">After presiding over a 16-year legal battle and hearing testimony
by hundreds of witnesses in Los Angeles, New Orleans and
Washington, Judge Francis L. Young wrote: &quot;The evidence ...
clearly shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable of
relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people, and
doing so with safety under medical supervision.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Further: &quot;It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious
for DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the
benefits of this substance in light of the evidence in this
record.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">What was the DEA's response to this finding by its own
administrative law judge?&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp; The DEA dismissed
it for &quot;ignoring the bulk of medical evidence,&quot;
according to a DEA lawyer.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Yet, the bulk of evidence against marijuana's medical use is not
very conclusive at all.&nbsp; It is constantly qualified with
&quot;could's&quot; and &quot;may's&quot; and
&quot;maybe's.&quot;&nbsp; Why is this so much more persuasive
than the evidence in favor of medical marijuana?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Yet, even though the Food and Drug Administration has approved
studies of the effects of marijuana on AIDS wasting syndrome by
Dr. Donald Abrams of the University of California at San
Francisco, the DEA has refused to grant Abrams access to medical
marijuana.&nbsp; Other university researchers report similar
complaints.&nbsp; The DEA seems to be uninterested in research
that fails to support its reefer madness.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">That's what I mean by &quot;Keystone Kops.&quot;&nbsp; This is
one of the most pathetic conflicts between government agencies
over an issue of health since the federal government began to
condemn tobacco through one branch while subsidizing it through
others.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Meanwhile, the suffering needlessly suffer even more -- unless
someone breaks the law to help them get &quot;some comfort&quot;
before they die.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Clinton administration spokesmen fret that legalizing marijuana
for medical use will only encourage young people to think drugs
are not dangerous.&nbsp; Yet, insisting that a popular drug like
marijuana is more dangerous than it really is only encourages
kids to think other truly dangerous drugs like heroin, cocaine or
LSD are not as dangerous as grown-ups say they are.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Where is President Clinton?&nbsp; Here's a group of patients who
do not need him to feel their pain.&nbsp; They just need him to
help relieve it. </p>

The Des Moines Register<br>
Post Office Box 957<br>
Des Moines, Iowa 50304</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dear Editor, </font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><font size="4">Regarding the letter from Graham Gillette
published in your paper on December 16, Mr. Gillette raises some
good arguments concerning the legalization of marijuana for
medical purposes. </font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><font size="4">Mr. Gillette informs us that marijuana has not
been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and a number of professional medical organizations.&nbsp;  He claims that the voters in California were duped into voting for a ballot initiative that legalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes. </font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><font size="4">The fact is that the voters in California voted
for compassion.&nbsp; They no longer want to make criminals out of desperately ill people who find relief from using marijuana.&nbsp;  This is not rocket science, as Mr. Gillette would prefer.&nbsp;  It is simply a matter of compassion, nothing else. </font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><font size="4">The California law does not make it legal for
doctors to prescribe marijuana to their patients.&nbsp;  It simply creates a legal defense which is triggered when a doctor says, &quot;I would prescribe marijuana, if it were legal.&quot;&nbsp;  A doctor is usually not going to make such a statement until every other alternative has been tried, and nothing else works. </font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><font size="4">The Governor of California had two
opportunities to approve more restrictive medical marijuana bills passed by the California Legislature in the two years preceding the ballot initiatives, but vetoed the measures on both occasions.&nbsp;  The voters were left with no reasonable alternative. </font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><font size="4">We can prevent that sort of thing here in Iowa by passing reasonable legislation that avoids putting desperately ill Iowans through the ordeal of arrest and prosecution.&nbsp;  Iowa could work with the FDA to establish a therapeutic research program which could conduct clinical research to determine how marijuana
works and the safest routes of administration. </font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><font size="4">We are not dealing with an extremely dangerous substance like most of those approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for prescription.&nbsp;  In 1988, a law judge for the Drug Enforcement Administration ruled that, &quot;Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.&quot; </font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><font size="4">In 1995, the prestigious British medical journal, Lancet, editorialized that, &quot;The smoking of cannabis, even long term, is not harmful to health.&quot;&nbsp;  Studies by the National Center for Toxicological Research in Pine Bluff, Arkansas came to similar conclusions. </font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><font size="4">The American Public Health Association, the
largest and oldest organization of health professionals in the world, has recommended that marijuana be legalized for medical purposes, as has the American Nurses Association. </font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><font size="4">I, for one, don't think my tax money is being wisely spent arresting and prosecuting sick people for trying to
relieve their pain. </font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><font size="4">Sincerely, </font></p>

Say</strong></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="6"><em><strong>Flimsy case for
legalized pot</strong></em></font><font size="4"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><spacer type="horizontal" size="40">The Dec. 5 Register editorial &quot;Marijuana:
What's the Fuss?&quot; uses anecdotal evidence to make its flimsy
case for the legalization of pot.&nbsp; It is unwise and irresponsible
to suggest that doctors should have the right to
&quot;prescribe&quot; marijuana without scientific evidence that
smoking marijuana can provide relief for a medical condition.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">It has never been scientifically demonstrated that marijuana can
treat a disease or relieve a patient's symptoms.&nbsp; In fact,
the scientific and medical communities have overwhelmingly
rejected this notion.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">The American Medical Association, the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society, the American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of
Ophthalmology, and the American Cancer Society have all rejected
marijuana's so-called medicinal use.&nbsp; These organizations
have done this not because they lack compassion, but because
sound medical research does not validate the outlandish claims of
the legalization movement.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Even if we were to agree that smoking marijuana can ease the
suffering of a person, it does not mean that pot is the only
solution or even the best one.&nbsp; The side effects of
marijuana, both to the user and society, make pot an inferior alternative
to nearly every accepted treatment.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">The voters of California and Arizona passed &quot;medicinal
marijuana&quot; referendums last month based on misinformation
similar to what The Register printed.&nbsp; A patient may, as
stated in the editorial, receive similar benefits from the
prescription drug Marinol and smoking pot.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">However, these substances do not represent the entire universe of
drugs that are available.&nbsp; The Register should be ashamed of
its willingness to ignore scientific research, the side effects
of smoking marijuana, and the fact that there are many safer and
more appropriate drugs available on the market.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I have little doubt that the people cited in The Register's
editorial claim to have benefited from their ability to smoke
marijuana, but these assertions alone are not enough to change
public policy.&nbsp; Until it is scientifically proven that marijuana
is an effective medical treatment, its side effects can be
reduced, or that there are no other acceptable alternatives, we
should reject the dangerous precedent that the voters of Arizona
and California were duped into passing.<br>

<p align="center"><font size="7">Marijuana: What's the fuss?</font> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>An Iowa woman</strong>
smokes it legally. <br>
Why can't others, by prescription? </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Lost in the dust kicked up by the suddenly
renewed storm over legalizing marijuana is the fact that the drug
has been legal for 10 years, in pill form.&nbsp; Distributors in
Cedar Rapids and Omaha supply the prescription pills to Iowa, and
it's on the approved list for the poor.&nbsp; In fiscal `96, Iowa Medicaid
paid $17,500 for the drug, trade name Marinol, at $4.63 per pill,
primarily for treatment of nausea caused by cancer chemotherapy. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">In theory, the pill is the therapeutic equal of the
cigarette.&nbsp; The U.S. Public Health Service has found no
evidence that smoking marijuana provides any greater therapeutic
value than Marinol, whether used to treat glaucoma, multiple sclerosis,
AIDS, or any of the other conditiom for which it's
prescribed.&nbsp; The National Institutes of Health agree.&nbsp;
Others - including an Iowan who has used both legally - disagree. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Meanwhile, months of stormy debate in California and Arizona over legalizing
marijuana for medical use came to a head last month when voters
in both states said yes, by comfortable margins.&nbsp; But far
from putting the matter to rest, the vote has shifted the
argument to the national stage.&nbsp; In congressional hearings
this week, the two states' actions were blasted as part of an insidious national
drive to legalize drugs and push users toward harder stuff. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">With the pill form available, and two medical/scientific branches
of the federal government contending that the effects of the pill
and the cigarette are equivalent, why the fuss over making marijuana
cigarettes available through medical channels? <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Because they're far from equal, according to an Iowa victim of
multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; Marijuana cigarettes work for
her.&nbsp; Marinol doesn't. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Barbara Douglass of Storm Lake is one of only eight Americans
provided with legal marijuana cigarettes through a U.S. Food and
Drug Administration program for &quot;compassionate&quot;
relief.&nbsp; She became ill with multiple sclerosis in 1988.&nbsp;
She was given a prescription for Marinol, and found it far too
powerful. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;You took Marinol, and the Marinol took you,&quot; she
said.&nbsp; &quot;It's too heavy, too strong.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The pills came in a gel form whose dosage was difficult to
regulate, she said.&nbsp; It would &quot;knock out everything you
wanted to think, say and do.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">She continued the treatment for three months in 1991 and told her
doctor it was not helping.&nbsp; Then a lawsuit temporarily
opened a tiny window of opportunity that allowed distribution of marijuana
cigarettes to a handful of people, she among them.&nbsp; The
cigarettes come from North Carolina's Research Triangle. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The advantage of smoking marijuana, she said, is that you can
adjust the dosage as needed to ease your pain, simply by the
number of draws on the cigarette before setting it down.&nbsp;
She smokes 10 per day. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">But while Marinol failed her, Douglass said, it worked for a
friend.&nbsp; It eased the pain and nausea caused by the
chemotherapy after surgery for breast cancer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Some who favor legalizing marijuana cigarettes
argue that Marinol contains just one of several substances in
marijuana that provide pain relief.&nbsp; The contradiction
between that contention and the findings of the PHS and NIH may
be worth further study.&nbsp; But the fundamental issue of
legalization remains: <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Should doctors have the prerogative to presribe dangerous and
possibly addictive drugs when they think their patients need
them?&nbsp; And the answer is the same, whether the drug be
marijuana, morphine, codeine, Demerol, or any of a bunch of
others on the &quot;controlled substance&quot; list: Yes.&nbsp; To
deny doctors all the tools that should be available to them is to
let those who misuse drugs dictate medical policy. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Far from weakening either our laws or our resolve in the war on
drugs, recognizing the value of some misused drugs helps to
dispel the notion that our policy is grounded in hysteria. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">E.C. FISH<br>
AMERICAN PATROL </font></p>

<p><font size="7"><strong>Of pot, pills and politics </strong></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4">In the midst of an election day that seemed
notable only for its low turnout, residents of two states voted
to punch a fair-size hole in the status quo.&nbsp;  While the attention
of the nation was diverted by the task of re-electing incumbents this
election day, Californians and Arizonans approved separate ballot
initiatives effectively decriminalizing the medicinal use of
cannabis and in doing so fired the first serious counter-salvo in
the ongoing war on drugs in many a moon.<br>
</font><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4">Legally, the step taken by these two states
is a rather small one -- manufacture, distribution and possession
remain illegal in both states, meaning that at best these
measures provide a criminal defense for them.&nbsp; Politically, however,
they represent a giant leap away from officially approved
conventional wisdom on the topic of drugs and their ramifications
could lead to a major shift in policy.<br>
</font><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4">By asserting that pot can have legitimate
uses, these measures tear a key stone out of the wall of
&quot;weed with its roots in hell&quot;-style demonization that
the government has used to justify its zero-tolerance drug
policies for decades.&nbsp;  Without the until-now prevailing
characrerization of pot as pure evil, such features of current
drug policy as mass incarceration, mandatory sentencing, confiscation
without due process and the rhetorical declaration of war on US citizens
might begin to seem like extreme overreactions.<br>
</font><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4">By making this change in cannabis's
context, Californiast and Arizonans have fundamentally altered
the terms of the drug policy debate.&nbsp;  While the &quot;pure
evil&quot; argument has skewed that debate toward the concept of
drugs as a law enforcement issue, the initiative's view of pot as
having a role in medical treatment effectively recasts drugs as a
public health issue, which observers as diverse as Clinton
administration Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and Reagan administration
Secretary of State George Shultz think it should have been all along.&nbsp; 
With this change, the language of hysteria is to some measure
replaced by the language of science, raising the level of debate
accordingly.<br>
</font><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4">The arguments raised against the
propositions before their passage are particularly instructive as
to just whose interests are affected by drug policy, with money
as usual taking a greater role than might seem just.&nbsp;  One of the major,
though ultimately unconvincing, arguments against passage was
that the medico-pharmaceutical industry had developed a synthetic
analog for the active ingredient in cannathis that had none of
pot's &quot;side effects.&quot;&nbsp;  With competition from a naturally
occurring product of a plant that can be cheaply grown just about
anywhere, the market for the much more expensive artificial
version whose main advantage lay in its legality was obviously
threatened, and the industry fought both initiatives hard.&nbsp;  In the
end, naked self interest lost to common sense, a result too
rarely seen in American politics.&nbsp;  It can also be seen as somewhat
disingenuous that an industry that has made Ritalin tablets more common
at American elementary schools than M&amp;Ms and built a
&quot;happiness industry&quot; around Prozac and its ilk should
object to a drug's psychoactivity.<br>
</font><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4">Despite the slippery slope arguments
offered by supporters of current drug policy, these measures are
unlikely to hasten the day when hard packs of 20 sinsemilla
filter tips are available at the corner market.&nbsp;  At best, it makes marijuana
a prescription drug, subject to regulated distribution and
medical protocol.&nbsp;  Nor should the issue of abuse be belittled --
anyone who's been out in the world at any time in the last 30
yean can probably point to any number of individuals who could
serve as walking arguments against the stuff (though to be fair,
any honest adult could probably point to many more individuals
who serve as warnings against good old legally available
alcohol).&nbsp;  Nor should what happens in these two states be mistaken
for a national trend -- what effect this will have in the other
48 remains to be seen.<br>
</font><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4">Still, this could represent the first part
of a distinct shift in the way we deal with drug policy.&nbsp;  By
electing to take the issue away from the SWAT team and giving it
to the research team, the people of Arirona and California have
at least raised the possibility of replacing fear and reaction
with reason and informed decision, a hopeful sign in a political
culture that's offered very few hopeful signs lately.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Allen Helmers is fighting for his life.&nbsp;
He's scheduled to go to court on Nov. 20 for violating his
parole.&nbsp; Cops found nearly a half-pound of marijuana in his one-room
apartment in Waterloo.&nbsp; He's been convicted of possession
once before. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;If I go to prison, I just hope to God I find the strength
to survive,&quot; Helmers says. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Helmers isn't out to get high.&nbsp; He needs it to live.&nbsp;
The victim of a drunk driving accident, Helmers broke his back in
six places.&nbsp; In order to make him mobile, his vertebrae were
fused.&nbsp; The accident also acted as a catalyst.&nbsp; He has fiber
malisia, a disease that slowly eats the soft tissue of the
body.&nbsp; With his immune system lowered, the disease kicked
into overdrive and hasn't quit since.&nbsp; He is in chronic
pain. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Doctors pumped him full of pills, hoping to find the right
combination of chemicals to make it go away.&nbsp; It didn't
work.&nbsp; Helmers jokes that he has &quot;a five gallon bucket
of empty prescriptions&quot; that did more damage than
good.&nbsp; Then someone suggested marijuana. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;I've tried almost every kind of pill out there,&quot; the
fortyish Helmers says.&nbsp; &quot;I just left the hospital
yesterday with a bleeding stomach because of the side effects.&nbsp;
But the courts seem to think there's some sort of magic pill out
there that will cure everything.&nbsp; The pills just make me
sicker.&nbsp; Marijuana is the only thing that works.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">For years marijuana has been a taboo drug in the eyes of the
law.&nbsp; Since it was outlawed by the Marijuana Tax Act in
1937, cannabis has been denounced as everything from &quot;wacky
tabacky&quot; to one of the most evil drugs on the street --
rarely as a remedy for what ails you. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">In recent years, however, the medical world has been
rediscovering marijuana, studying the plant for medicinal
applications.&nbsp; Once prescribed as a quick fix for a migraine
or as a muscle relaxant, marijuana is now being used to ease the
pain of AIDS and cancer patients.&nbsp; Lester Grinspoon, a
professor at Harvard Medical School, has been studying the plant
since 1967.&nbsp; He says marijuana helps with everything from
rare diseases to PMS, and has the potential to aid thousands of
people. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;Marijuana is a remarkably safe, non-toxic medicine, that,
if it becomes available, will be inexpensive and unbelievably
versatile,&quot; Grinspoon says.&nbsp; There are over 45 symptoms
it works for, everything from nausea to muscle spasms.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Yet marijuana won't be sold over the counter any time soon.&nbsp;
It's the forbidden cure.&nbsp; Few are allowed access.&nbsp;
Listed as a Schedule I drug by the Controlled Substances Act,
it's considered highly dangerous, inviting abuse, with little or
no medical value.&nbsp; Patients must prove they have a medical necessity
to use the drug, which often translates into drawn out court
battles. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Only eight people in the United States receive marijuana
legally.&nbsp; George McMahon is one of them.&nbsp; He has
Nailpattla Syndrome, which causes everything from pain and spasms
to nausea.&nbsp; Doctors said he'd be dead by now.&nbsp; Once
they gave him six hours to live.&nbsp; He climbed into his car,
lit up a joint and had his wife drive him home.&nbsp; Now holed
up at his house in Bode, Iowa, McMahon gets a half pound of
marijuana from the government every month, smoking up to 10
joints a day. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;It doesn't work the same way when you have to use it,&quot;
McMahon says.&nbsp; &quot;When you smoke a joint in anticipation
of getting high, you do.&nbsp; I don't get the euphoric
part.&nbsp; I get to forget about my pain.&nbsp; All these
generals and cops keep coming out and saying that there's no
evidence that this works, but then why am I in this
program.&nbsp; I'm evidence.&nbsp; There's people out there like
me who need this.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Patients may now have a chance to get marijuana legally.&nbsp;
California and Arizona recently passed initiatives allowing
doctors to prescribe marijuana to those who need it.&nbsp; Rather
than denying patients the drug and forcing them to buy it
illegally off the street, both Arizona's Proposition 200 and
California's Proposition 215 put control of the drug in the hands
of the government, regulating potency and dosage. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">But that's only two states.&nbsp; McMahon wants to see cannabis
legalized across the board, especially at home.&nbsp; Since Iowa
doesn't have propositions on the ballot, he has to work for
legislative reform.&nbsp; He, along with co-founder Carl Olsen,
started Iowan's for Medical Marijuana.&nbsp; Their intent: push
the legislature into action, with Helmers as the point man.&nbsp;
It won't be easy.&nbsp; Legislators are weary of legalizing
something that carries so much political baggage. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;I'm not convinced this is something the medical community
wants,&quot; says Rep. Jeff Lamberti (R-Ankeny).&nbsp; &quot;I
don't see them saying this is something they need, and some are
saying it does more harm than good.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Rep. Robert Brunkhorst (R-Waverly) agrees: &quot;I don't favor
it.&nbsp; I think there are alternative drugs out there that are
better suited than marijuana.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">But some legislators are more sympathetic.&nbsp; Republican Sen.
Gene Maddox of Clive, while by no means endorsing marijuana use,
hasn't closed the door. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;I'd be open to it on a restricted basis.&nbsp; But I have a
lot of questions that need answered before I can make up my
mind.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">For now Helmers is caught in the crossfire.&nbsp; Until the
debate is over or he proves he has a medical necessity, he'll
continue to smoke illegally.&nbsp; It's the only way the pain
will go away. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;Every day I decide whether I should kill myself or not,
whether the pain is too much,&quot; Helmers says.&nbsp;
&quot;It's bad enough being ill without having to deal with an
uncompassionate government trying to throw you in jail for
relieving the pain.&nbsp; People shouldn't have to hide or feel
they are a criminal in order to feel better.&quot; </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><tt>October 30, 1996 </tt></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><tt>Mr. Carl E. Olsen<br>
Post Office Box 4091<br>
Des Moines, Iowa 50333<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Mr. Olsen:</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Thank you for your further correspondence
on the status of illegal drugs in America.&nbsp; I appreciate
your opinions, but I have not been pursuaded to change my stance
on the legalization of illicit drugs.&nbsp; Drugs are illegal
because they are dangerous.&nbsp; Drugs are not dangerous because
they are illegal.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>In your most recent letter, you present the
following arguments: There is no hope for winning the battle against
illegal drug use, drug use is a medical problem and should be
treated as such, illegal drugs are less harmful than alcohol and
tobacco and therefore should be legalized, and if drugs were
legalized, then the price of illegal drugs would drop as well as
the crime associated with illegal drugs.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Enclosed you will find a copy of a floor </tt></font><a
href="grassley2.html"><font size="4"><tt>statement</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt> that I made on the 23 of January to address these,
as well as other arguments made by those who favor
legalization.&nbsp; I believe you will find all of your concerns
addressed there.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>I would like to update certain points with
additional information that has been released since this
statement was made.&nbsp; On April 25, 1996, the Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse released a study that confirmed
what many had all ready suspected.&nbsp; Marijuana users are 79
times as likely as those who do not use marijuana to go on to harder
drugs.&nbsp; This is an alarming statistic, and the first time
that anyone has proven the statistical link between marijuana and
other drugs.&nbsp; To compare, the first studies that raised
alarms about the dangers of smoking indicated that those who
smoked were nine to ten times more likely to develop lung cancer
than those who did not.&nbsp; And those who drank alcohol were
three to four times as likely to develop cirrhosis of the liver
as those who did not.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>You have also contacted me in support of
the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp; I would like
to mention some additional information for you to consider.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Let me say at the outset that I am opposed
to the use of marijuana for medical purposes.&nbsp; There have
been over 12,000 published scientific studies of marijuana, none
of which have shown smoking marijuana to be a safe or effective
medicine for the treatment of any condition.&nbsp; The most
recent comprehensive study was ordered by the U.S. Public Health
Service and completed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
in March of 1992.&nbsp; The report concluded that marijuana has
never been shown to be safe or effective as a medicine, and that
there are better and safer drugs for all of the conditions that
were considered.&nbsp; Let me share with you some further history
of this issue.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Before 1906, when the Pure Food and Drug
Act was passed, placing regulations on the sale and manufacture
of medicine, the prevailing attitude was one of &quot;let the buyer
beware.&quot;&nbsp; Before this, many medicines were touted as the
cure-all for a wide variety of ailments.&nbsp; These unlabeled
and uncontrolled medicines, sometimes pushed by unscrupulous
doctors, often did more harm than good.&nbsp; Often, these snake
oil medicines contained addictive substances, such as cocaine,
marijuana, or morphine, turning their unwitting customer into an
addict who would then clamor for more because it made him
&quot;feel better.&quot;</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>In an effort to protect the public from the
potentially harmful effects of such &quot;medicines,&quot; the
Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was passed.&nbsp; These laws were
written to ensure that no substance is marketed as medicinal
until it has been proven to be both safe and effective.&nbsp; In addition,
all ingredients must be listed on the label.&nbsp; In 1938, the
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act established the Food and Drug
Administration and gave the FDA the authority and responsibility
to require that manufacturers prove their products' safety.&nbsp;
The role of the FDA was expanded in 1962 to include both the
safety and efficacy of products under their jurisdiction.&nbsp;
It is important to note that marijuana has never been shown
scientifically to be a safe or effective medicine for the
treatment of any condition.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>In order for a drug to be approved as a
medicine, it must meet several strict requirements to ensure
safety standards.&nbsp; The process for approval begins with a
study of a drug's chemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology.&nbsp; Because
marijuana is not a stable substance, especially when it is
smoked, the varying, complex mixture of chemicals is extremely
difficult to study.&nbsp; Many of the chemical combinations are
known to be harmful, while other components have yet to be
studied.&nbsp; New chemical components are still being
discovered.&nbsp; Some of the known chemical combinations include
hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde,
acetone, phenol, cresol, naphthalene, and other well-known
carcinogens such as benzpyrene, benzanthracene, benzene, and
nitrosamine.&nbsp; These carcinogens have been found to be the
cancer causing agents in tobacco smoke, and are present in higher concentrations
in marijuana smoke than tobacco smoke.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Next, the chemical reactions that occur
when a drug is taken must be known and reproducible for the FDA
to consider approving a drug.&nbsp; Dosages must be measurable to a
high degree of accuracy.&nbsp; This is necessary to determine what,
if any, interactions may occur if the drug being tested is taken
in combination with other medicines, as well as the effects of
higher or lower dosage rates.&nbsp; I know that there is a lot of
anecdotal information around indicating that marijuana helps some
people, but this is not generally true.&nbsp; And we need to be
careful when we make decisions about drugs and the claims some
people make for them.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>So where do the claims that marijuana is
beneficial for persons suffering from glaucoma, AIDS, Multiple
Sclerosis, and other ailments come from?&nbsp; Just as there is a
powerful tobacco lobby, there is a well-financed and
well-organized marijuana legalization lobby.&nbsp; Many of the
same claims and tactics that were used in tobacco advertizing
campaigns are now being used for marijuana legalization.&nbsp;
Groups such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML) have stated that the issue of medicinal uses for
marijuana will be used in an attempt to give marijuana a good
name.&nbsp; Similar tactics were used by the tobacco industry
before the Federal Trade Commission halted the practice in
1955.&nbsp; 'Camel' cigarettes were advertized as an aid for
digestion and said to prevent fatigue.&nbsp; 'Kool' brand
cigarettes claimed to prevent the common cold.&nbsp; Similar to
the way that the tobacco industry works to undermine the efforts
of the FDA, NORML supports initiatives at both state and federal
levels to circumvent current consumer protection laws, such as
the guidelines for establishing marijuana as a legal drug.&nbsp;
Just as the tobacco industry has denied that tobacco is addictive
and causes cancer, the marijuana legalization movement denies the
harmful effects of marijuana.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Still, many ill people claim that using
marijuana has made their illnesses easier.&nbsp; </tt><i><tt>But
science does not support these claims.</tt></i><tt>&nbsp; The
National Eye Institute has reported that the intraocular
pressure-lowering action of marijuana is not effective enough to
prevent optic nerve damage caused by glaucoma.&nbsp; As of June,
1994, there are 24 agents, all approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, that are incorporated into a variety of medicines
to be used for glaucoma treatment.&nbsp; There are also surgical options
available.&nbsp; Studies performed in the early l970s showed that
marijuana, when smoked, did lower the intraocular pressure in
people with normal pressure and in those with glaucoma.&nbsp;
However, follow-up studies, conducted over a ten year period,
(1978 - 1988) by the National Eye Institute showed that although
marijuana -- or more specifically, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) -- did lower intraocular pressure when administered, none of
the studies showed that marijuana, or any of its components,
could safely and effectively lower intraocular pressure enough to
prevent optic nerve damage.&nbsp; In addition, these studies
showed that marijuana had a number of undesirable and potentially
harmful side effects, such as elevated blood pressure, dry eye,
euphoria, as well as a greater risk for respiratory system
damage.&nbsp; These are in addition to the psychological side
effects.&nbsp; According to a fact sheet released by the
Department of Health and Human Services, entitled </tt><i><tt>National
Eye Institute Fact Sheet on the Therapeutic Use of Marijuana for
Glaucoma</tt></i><tt>, &quot;The availability of a wide variety
of alternative treatments that do not have marijuana's
psychoactive and other specific side effects argues against the
use of marijuana for treating glaucoma.&nbsp; Marijuana offers no
advantage over currently available glaucoma drugs and indeed may
be less effective than these agents.&quot;</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Marijuana supporters have also endorsed its
use for AIDS patients with wasting syndrome.&nbsp; This syndrome
is characterized by severely debilitating anorexia and weight loss,
and is of particular concern because it can exacerbate the
primary illness and is associated with a poor prognosis.&nbsp;
Marijuana is said to be beneficial because it increases the
patient's appetite and decreases nausea that sometimes occurs as
a result of other medications.&nbsp; However, according to
researchers, marijuana smoking also causes a number of problems,
causing more harm than good.&nbsp; </tt><i><tt>Marijuana has also
been shown to suppress the body's natural immune system, which is
especially dangerous to persons with the HIV virus or AIDS.</tt></i><tt>&nbsp;
Smokers have about half the life expectancy of non-smokers, and have
an increased incidence of pneumonia when compared to non-marijuana
smokers.&nbsp; Drug absorption from marijuana smoking is
dependent upon deep inhalation of marijuana smoke, an impractical
suggestion for non-smoking patients or those with limited lung
capacity because of illness (such as pneumonia).&nbsp; Also,
there currently is a synthetic form of THC, called
&quot;Marinol&quot; available as an anti-nausea agent for
patients who have failed to respond to other drugs.&nbsp; Unlike
marijuana, Marinol has met and passed all of the testing and
regulations that the FDA requires.&nbsp; The medical use of
Marinol is highly restricted because of the potential side
effects.&nbsp; Fortunately, newer, better anti-emetic medications
have been developed and are now available.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Because of a placebo effect, a patient may
believe a drug is helpful when it is not.&nbsp; Anecdotal
evidence may point to a drug having medicinal value, but this
needs to be followed up with scientific studies.&nbsp; Because of marijuana's
addictive and mind-altering effects, a placebo effect can be
magnified.&nbsp; Users are likely to exaggerate the
benefits.&nbsp; For example, there have been numerous reports
from patients that have claimed that marijuana has cause
improvement in multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; However, a controlled,
scientific study by Dr. H. S. Greenberg, reported in </tt><i><tt>Clinical
Pharmacology &amp; Therapy</tt></i><tt> (Vol. 55:324-328, 1994)
showed that smoking marijuana actually made the symptoms of
multiple sclerosis worse.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>In addition, many reports of marijuana's
beneficial effects are based not on science but on anecdotes from individuals
who claim results for themselves.&nbsp; While these individuals
may feel they have benefited, we cannot base public policy
decisions on important issues on anecdotal information.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, many in the press and elsewhere do not look beyond
such information.&nbsp; The best available science, however,
clearly and overwhelmingly demonstrates the contrary.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>I hear from many thoughtful persons, such
as yourself, who urge me to consider supporting marijuana for
medical use.&nbsp; I have looked at the copious research that has
been done on this issue and urge you to do so as well.&nbsp; For
a further discussion on the therapeutic uses of marijuana, there
are a number of reports that examine the available scientific
information.&nbsp; &quot;Health Aspects of Cannabis,&quot; written
by Leo E. Hollister and published in </tt><i><tt>Pharmacological
Reviews</tt></i><tt> (Vol. 38, No. 1:1986) is an excellent
starting point.&nbsp; Numerous other studies have also been
published in </tt><i><tt>The New England Journal of Medicine</tt></i><tt>, </tt><i><tt>The
Lancet</tt></i><tt>, and other reputable medical journals as well as
those available from NIH and the FDA.</tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>In closing, I want to relay to you my
strong feelings about representative government.&nbsp; For
democracy to function, there has to be two-way communication
between Americans and their elected representatives.&nbsp; By
sharing your views with me, Iowans play a vital role in this process.&nbsp;
Hearing from you enables me to be a better U.S. Senator, and I
very much appreciate the time you took to inform me of your
concerns.&nbsp; Thanks again for keeping in touch.</tt></font></p>

Mr. Carl E. Olsen <br>
Iowans For Medical Marijuana <br>
P.O. Box 4091 <br>
Des Moines, Iowa 50333 </p>

<p>Dear Carl: </p>

<p>Thank you for writing to support the Medical Marijuana
Rescheduling Bill (H.R. 2618) as well as for the information you
sent me.&nbsp; I welcome this opportunity to respond. </p>

<p>You may be interested to learn that Representative Frank of
Massachusetts introduced H.R. 2618 on November 10, 1995.&nbsp;
Marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I drug which
means that it has a high potential for abuse and is not permitted
for medical use.&nbsp; H.R. 2618 would reschedule marijuana as a
Schedule II drug and allow doctors to prescribe marijuana for
medical purposes such as treating glaucoma.&nbsp; The bill would
also establish the Office for the Supply of Internationally
Controlled Drugs which would regulate and supervise the
production of marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp; H.R. 2618
was referred to the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health
and Environment and the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on
Crime.&nbsp; No further action has been taken on the bill at this
time. </p>

<p>I understand that marijuana does have some medical uses.&nbsp;
However, as you may know, the National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse has reported the number of adolescents aged 12-17 using
marijuana and other drugs has increased from 5.3% in 1992 to
19.9% in 1995.&nbsp; I am concerned that legalizing drugs for
medical purposes could increase the supply of marijuana available
to drug abusers and cause a further lapse in the progress that
has been made so far in fighting the war on drugs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>While we may not completely agree on this issue, please do not
hesitate to contact me in the future if you have questions or
concerns you would like to express.&nbsp; Again, thanks for
writing. </p>

<br>
<br>
Dear Dale, <br>
<br>
I am in receipt of <a href="dale-01.html"> your letter</a> dated
September 4.&nbsp; I must say that I'm in a state of shock at the
low-level, sleazy and hateful response you've made to <a
href="olsen-02.html"> my letter</a> of August 17.&nbsp; It almost
sounds like you were reading someone else's letter, since it's
almost impossible to recognize your letter as a reply to anything
I wrote.&nbsp; I did not ask you to support the legalization of
marijuana.&nbsp; You have certainly earned my complete
contempt.&nbsp; With people like you in charge of drug policy,
it's no wonder that drug abuse is skyrocketing.&nbsp; I don't
know how people like you can sleep at night. <br>
<br>
You have a double tongue.&nbsp; You encourage sick people to seek
legal medical treatment, but you won't help Allen Helmers who is
seeking legal medical treatment.&nbsp; Allen's doctor is ready to
testify that he has a medical necessity to use marijuana, and
medical necessity is a recognized, valid legal defense to
criminal charges for possession of marijuana in Iowa.&nbsp; In
other words, it is legal for Allen to use marijuana. I've
attached a copy of the <a href="../HELMERS/olsen-01.html"> letter</a>
I wrote to the Black Hawk County District Court, along with the
decision of the Pottawattamie District Court.&nbsp; You are
obviously the one who has no respect for the law. <br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely, <br>
<br>

    Dear Senator <a href="mailto:tom_harkin@harkin.senate.gov">Harkin</a>, <br>

    Enclosed are letters from <a href="../HELMERS/helmers1.html">Allen

    The letters are self-explanatory.&nbsp; I'd appreciate
    anything you can do to help Allen, particularly by introducing
    legislation during the upcoming Congressional session.&nbsp;
    A letter from you to the court pleading for leniency may also
    help him. <br>
    <br>
    I've also enclosed a letter from the Iowa Board of Pharmacy

    <br>
    Finally, I've enclosed a copy of an article from the <a
    href="../nejm.html">New England Journal of Medicine</a>,
    which explains how NIDA blocked the AIDS Wasting Syndrome
    study in California.&nbsp; I understand that Dr. Abrams has
    filed another protocol, and I would like you to encourage
    NIDA to allow such research. <br>
    <br>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Dear Senator Harkin,
<BR>
<BR><DD>As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that supplies funding to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), I would like to share my concerns with you about <A HREF="../nejm.html"> AIDS wasting syndrome studies</A>.
<BR>
<BR><DD>Recently, Dr. Donald Abrams, of the University of California, San Francisco, sought permission to conduct a privately financed pilot study comparing three potencies of inhaled marijuana (high, medium, and low) with oral delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (dronabinol) capsules.&nbsp;  Dr. Abrams' study was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Investigational New Drug No. 43,542), the University of California, San Francisco, institutional review board, the California Research Advisory Panel, and the scientific advisory committee of the San Francisco Community Consortium.
<BR>
<BR><DD>The Drug Enforcement Administration first refused to allow Dr. Abrams to import marijuana from The Netherlands, and then the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which controls the domestic supply of marijuana for clinical research, rejected Dr. Abrams' request in April 1995.
<BR>
<BR><DD>This is very wrong.&nbsp;  Other researchers will now be discouraged from attempting to secure approval for further research.&nbsp;  The application processes are long and complicated.
<BR>
<BR><DD>Furthermore, the denial by NIDA has prompted researchers and patients to appeal to the California voters through the initiative process.&nbsp;  Petitioners this year gathered approximately twice the number of needed signatures to get a medical marijuana initiative on the ballot in November.
<BR>
<BR><DD>The California medical marijuana initiative will allow patients to grow their own marijuana.&nbsp;  Polls indicate the initiative will pass.&nbsp;  The intitiative solves the problem for state law enforcement agencies, but does not address federal scheduling of marijuana.&nbsp;  Possession of marijuana would still remain a federal crime, although most likely unenforced.
<BR>
<BR><DD>I would appreciate any pressure you can apply on NIDA to simplify its requirements for granting approval for supplying marijuana for legitimate research.&nbsp;  This would help to eliminate the necessity of patients trying to find marijuana on their own without legal sanction from the federal government.&nbsp;  Thank you very much.  
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><DD>Sincerely,
<BR><BR>
<BR><DD>Carl E. Olsen

Des Moines, IA 50333</tt></p>

<p><tt>Dear Mr. Olsen:</tt></p>

<p><tt>I am writing in response to your letter dated June 21,
1996.&nbsp;  In regard to Senate File 487, this legislative bill was
approved on June 1, 1979.&nbsp;  The Board of Pharmacy Examiners adopted </tt><a
href="rules.html"><tt>620 Iowa Administrative Code chapter 12
&quot;Medicinal Use of Marijuana&quot;</tt></a><tt> on October 1,
1979.&nbsp;  A copy of chapter 12 is enclosed per your request.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Subrule 12.3(5) called for the termination of the research
program on June 30, 1981.&nbsp;  It appears that the program ended on
that date.&nbsp;  Because of changes in Iowa Code chapter 204 as amended
by 1986 Iowa Acts, chapter 1037, chapter 12 was rescinded in its
entirety on January 20, 1987.&nbsp;  Apparently, the change in the Iowa
Code in 1986 eliminated the need for investigational programs on
the medical use of marijuana.</tt></p>

<p><tt>In regard to the advisory group of physicians which was
required to be formed seventeen years ago in 1979 pursuant to
Senate File 487 and 620 I.A.C. chapter 12, these records are
either no longer in existence or are nonretrievable.&nbsp;  The current
office files contain no information about the advisory group or
its activities.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Sincerely yours,</tt></p>

<H2><P>	Seriously ill people who use marijuana as medicine should not be arrested
and required to prove their medical necessity in a criminal trial.
Seriously ill patients should have their claims heard by the Iowa Board of
Pharmacy Examiners or some other qualified board.  If a seriously ill
patient has a legitimate medical necessity, that patient should be certified
and be exempted from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa.  The Iowa
Legislature should amend current state law by immunizing certified medical
marijuana users from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa and call upon
the federal government to amend existing federal statutes.
<P>	Iowa recognizes the defense of "medical necessity" to prosecution for the
possession of marijuana in the state of Iowa.  State of Iowa v. Jan Pleas,
No. 22690, Pottawattamie District Court (June 16, 1994).  Iowa law
recognizes the therapeutic value of marijuana.  Iowa Code  <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/206.html">124.206</A>(7)(a).
<P>	Between 1976 and 1991, the federal government supplied marijuana to
patients for medical purposes.  In 1991, the federal government decided to
stop supplying marijuana to new applicants.  Only two Iowans are currently
allowed to use marijuana legally, because of federal law prohibiting the use
of marijuana.  Other Iowans who were approved to receive marijuana were
never supplied.
<P>	It is not fair that all Iowans are not treated alike, some having arbitrary
rights that others do not have.

<P>	QUESTION:  Do you support enacting medical necessity legislation which
would exempt certain medical marijuana users from criminal prosecution in
the state of Iowa?</H2>
<P>
<H1>YES
<P>
NO
<P>
NOT SURE</H1>

Dear Mr. Olsen:
     Thank you for your letter of March 24, 1996 and the enclosed 
materials regarding proposals to permit certain individuals to use 
marijuana.  I am glad that you  took the time to share those concerns with 
me. 
     Recent medical evidence indicates that routine use of marijuana has
significant harmful side effects.  Accordingly, I do not support efforts 
to legalize marijuana.  At this time, there are prescription drugs on the
market to induce some of the effects attributed to marijuana, including 
the appetite loss experienced by chemotherapy patients and others.
     Thank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts with me. 
     Sincerely,
     Greg Ganske, M.D.

Dear Mr. Olsen: 
     Thank you for your letter of November 26, 1995 and the 
enclosed materials.  I am glad that you  took the time to share 
your thoughts with me. 
     As a doctor, I understand the terrible suffering experienced 
by victims of diseases such as AIDS  and cancer.  Many patients 
find it difficult that their loss of appetite results in 
significant weight loss,  often threatening their health. 
     Earlier this year, Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts 
introduced legislation to permit the  therapeutic use of 
marijuana for certain patients.  Under current law, marijuana is 
considered a Class  I drug and cannot be prescribed for any 
medical condition.  There are, however, several prescription  
drugs that use the same active ingredient as is found in 
marijuana.  I will be sure to keep your support  for Congressman 
Franks legislation in mind if it comes before the House for 
consideration. 
     Thank you again for your letter.  I hope to hear from you 
again on other issues of mutual concern. 
     Sincerely,
     Greg Ganske, M.D.

     Dear Mr. Olsen:

     Thank you for your recent letter enclosing the most recent
     status report on legislative and judiciary action relating
     to the medical use of marijuana.

     I now spend most of my time outside the boundaries of Iowa,
     and actually live in Arizona. I'm simply not available for
     participation on a local basis. I do support the medical
     use of marijuana and sincerely hope some relief can be gained
     from federal restrictions. This probably will require action
     in the Congress rather than Iowa. I would suggest seeking
     advice, if you already haven't, from your Congressional offices
     as to how to proceed.

     I wish you well.

     Sincerely,

     Harold E. Hughes

Dear Carl,

Thank you for your letter of July 1, 1995, inviting me to become an active
member of Iowans for Medical Marijuana. I fully support your effort, but I
have over-committed myself and am in danger of not doing several things
that I have promised as well as I want. At the current time I cannot be an
active member of your Board, but would like to assist you in more focused
(time - centered) rather than general ways. Please do not consider this a
rejection of your efforts, but only a postponement of my efforts.

Thank you for thinking of me. I hope to be able to work with you on
specific projects.


Sincerely,


R. Dean Wright, Ph.D.

Dear Carl:

My apologies for failing to write until now, but my hectic summer schedule
has allowed very little time for writing. First, I want to thank you for
all of your assistance with the medicinal marijuana project Senator
Szymoniak assigned to me as part of my internship. Your knowledge and
support opened my eyes to an interesting dilemma in the United States -- a
politically incorrect substance is not available to patients regardless of
the drug's safety and efficiency.

I do not support the illegal use of drugs nor do I believe marijuana
should be legalized. However, patients should not suffer unnecessarily
because of powerful lobbying groups and influenced politicians. I applaud
your efforts to help those who could truly benefit from medicinal
marijuana, and I would enjoy updates on the status of your political
battle. As I will be attending law school at the University of Iowa
beginning this Fall, I will probably have very little spare time.
Nevertheless, I would like to continue our correspondence as I believe it
would be mutually beneficial.

One last bit of information. I am originally from California and when I
was visiting some relatives in May, I read that the California State
Senate passed some type of bill that would allow for the medicinal use of
marijuana, you may want to check into it father. Thank you again for
allowing me to share in some of your knowledge and keep in touch.

Sincerely


Larisa Thomas-Norris

Dear Mr. Olson: 
 
The Department of General Services has reserved for your use the West 
steps of the State Capitol for a rally of Iowans for Medical Marijuana to 
be held on Sunday, August 5, 1995 beginning at Noon until 2:00 p.m.  I 
appreciate your appointing two marshalls, yourself and John Hartog 
(515/262-4660) to assist the 50 - 100 people expected to attend the 
event. 
 
I understand that your organization will again provide your own security 
arrangements as well as public address system.  We can offer you the use 
of the 110 volt electrical outlet located at the base of the light post 
immediately east of the Lincoln and Tad statue.  There are no charges for 
the use of the State Capitol grounds or electricity. 
 
Please remember no signs can be hung from the building, lamp posts or 
trees but signs carried by a single individual are acceptable.  I 
appreciate the efforts outlined in your letter to restrict the use of 
illegal drugs on the complex.  Capitol Police will be informed that two 
participants, <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">George McMahon</a> and Barbara Douglas are authorized to use 
marijuana by the federal government as well as the Iowa Board of Pharmacy 
Examiners. 
 
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 242-5120.

Senator Elaine Szymoniak
The Iowa Senate
Statehouse
L O C A L

Dear Senator Szymoniak:

I am again writing in response to your letter dated February 23, 1995, 
concerning the medicinal use of marijuana.  Board members and staff have 
conducted an extensive review of the medical literature pertaining to 
medical marijuana, including American, British, and Australian sources.  
Our search included all of the references listed at the end of this 
letter.  The Board believes that the pertinent medical literature 
supports its opposition to marijuana for therapeutic purposes and offers 
the following information for your review:

1.     &quot;...[T]he essence of arguments on both sides revolves around how 
much research is enough...despite published studies, very little still is 
known about the extent of marijuana's physiological and psychoactive 
effects.&quot;1

2.     Janet D. Lapey, M.D., the executive director of Concerned Citizens 
for Drug Prevention, Inc., is one of medicinal marijuana's most vocal 
opponents.  Dr. Lapey has stated that &quot;crude marijuana contains some 400 
chemicals, many unidentified, that, when smoked, combust into more than 
2,000 chemicals, including carcinogens and toxins such as benzene and 
toluene.1  Cannabis has also been described by C. H. Ashton as &quot;a prime 
example of a pharmacologically 'dirty' drug.  It contains many active 
substances with multiple effects and several (unknown) mechanisms of 
action.&quot;21
</pre>

Senator Elaine Szymoniak            Page 2                 March 10, 1995

3.     Dr. Lapey has also stated that the National Institutes of Health 
reports that &quot;new drugs, including the serotonin receptor antagonist 
ondansetron hydrochloride (Zofran...), surpass THC's therapeutic value in 
calming cancer patients' chemotherapy-induced nausea.  For HIV wasting 
syndrome, she points to the availability of dronabinol, noting the  
potential dangers of immunocompromised patients smoking a carcinogen-
containing substance.&quot;1

4.     Christine Hartel, Ph.D., the associate director for neuroscience 
in the Division of Clinical Research at the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse (NIDA), reinforces Dr. Lapey's remarks.  Dr. Hartel has stated 
&quot;that after 20 years of research that produced synthetic THC in 
dronabinol capsules, 'the doctors and researchers at the NIH do not see 
[inhaled] marijuana as having much promise'.&quot;1

5.     One recent article published In The Western Journal of Medicine 
has stated the following: &quot;Marijuana smoke contains carcinogens and more 
tar than tobacco smoke, and the psychoactive effects of marijuana 
ingestion have been implicated as a risk factor for injuries...daily 
marijuana smoking appears to be associated with respiratory conditions  
even among persons who never smoked tobacco.&quot;2  The study also found 
&quot;increased risks of injury-related and other (nonrespiratory, noninjury) 
outpatient visits among marijuana smokers, suggesting that marijuana use 
may have many adverse health effects&quot; (emphasis added).2  The authors 
concluded that &quot;[D]aily marijuana smoking, even in the absence of  
tobacco, appeared to be associated with an elevated risk of health care 
use for various health problems.&quot;2

6.     Donald P. Tashkin, M.D., a professor of medicine at the University 
of California School of Medicine in Los Angeles, has stated that 
&quot;[s]everal lines of evidence suggest that marijuana smoking is also 
associated with an increased risk for the development of respiratory 
tract malignancy.&quot;3

7.     Although the use of cannabis for medical purposes has been 
legalized in Canberra, Australia, it remains highly controversial.  The 
Australian federal health minister, the Australian Medical Association, 
and the Australian federal police are all pressuring lawmakers to repeal 
the new law.  The Australian Federal Attorney General has called on the 
members who passed the law to &quot;move quickly to repeal the amendments and 
repair the damage done to the territory's reputation for responsible law 
making.&quot;4

8.     Richard H. Schwartz, M.D., of the Fairfax Hospital for Children in 
Falls Church, Virginia, has stated that &quot;support of the use of marijuana 
for medical purposes is  scientifically unfounded.  There is no evidence 
that marijuana is superior to ondansetron (Zofran), dexamethasone, or 
synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (Marinol) as an antiemetic in patients 
undergoing chemotherapy.  Nor is there scientific evidence to support the 
use of marijuana for AIDS-associated anorexia, depression, epilepsy, 
narrow-angle glaucoma, or spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis.  
As a crude drug, moreover, marijuana has been shown to produce 
undesirable mental changes, disturbances in coordination, giddiness, and 
hypotension in at least 25 percent of novice users...&quot;6

<pre>
Senator Elaine Szymoniak            Page 3                 March 10, 1995

9.     Doris H. Milman, M.D., of the Children's Medical Center of 
Brooklyn (New York) has stated that &quot;[m]arijuana cannot be characterized 
as 'a remarkably safe substance.'  Its  active ingredient, 
tetrahydrocannabinol, may have some therapeutic value as an antiemetic  
but has not been generally accepted thus far, because there are other, 
more useful, such drugs and because its other applications are far from 
established.&quot;6

10.    An Australian article published in 1992 concluded that &quot;the 
results of standard in-vitro and in-vivo toxicological tests performed in 
the 1970s on animal preparations to which marijuana extracts were 
administered have proved to be good predictors of the long-term 
pathophysiological manifestations observed 20 years later in chronic 
marijuana smokers.  These manifestations also confirm anecdotal accounts 
reported throughout history of the damaging effects of cannabis.&quot;7

11.    Amanda Caswell, another Australian author, has warned that 
&quot;smoking is not an ideal method of drug delivery and chronic marijuana 
smoking has been associated with bronchitis and asthma.&quot;8

12.    Several authorities have criticized the survey of oncologists 
conducted by Richard E. Doblin and Mark A. R. Kleiman.  In their survey, 
Doblin and Kleiman stated the  following: &quot;Of the respondents who 
expressed an opinion, a majority (54%) thought marijuana should be 
available by prescription.&quot;12  In response, Richard H. Schwartz, M.D., 
has stated the following: &quot;I calculate that this 'majority' can be no 
more than 15% to 20% of the original sample and is probably much less.&quot;9  
Sandra S. Bennett of the Oregon Federation of Parents for Drug Free Youth 
stated the following in a letter to the editors of the Annals of Internal 
Medicine: &quot;
     I want...to point out that, although the authors [Doblin and  
Kleiman] stated their association with the John F. Kennedy School of  
Government of Harvard University, they failed to mention that Mr. Doblin  
is the founder and president of the Multidisciplinary Association for  
Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), referred to as the 'People's Psychedelic  
Pharmaceutical Company' in their newsletter head.  The organization has  
advocated research on humans with the street drug Ecstasy and the gradual  
medicalization and legalization of psychedelics.
     In MAPS newsletters dated Summer 1990 and August 1991, Doblin 
outlines a plan to use different forums, including Annals and the press, 
to lend credibility to the campaign to legalize marijuana use and to 
bolster a suit against the Drug Enforcement Administration.  I believe 
that the authors' bias and hidden agenda should be made known to your  
readers.9

13.    Stuart M. Levitz, M.D., of the Boston University School of 
Medicine, has warned that &quot;[p]atients should be aware that this practice 
[of smoking marijuana] may involve unforeseen risks.  Studies have shown 
that most illegally obtained marijuana is contaminated with Aspergillus 
species...Aspergillus spores easily pass through
</pre>

<hr>

<pre>
Senator Elaine Szymoniak            Page 4                 March 10, 1995

contaminated marijuana that is smoked...in immunocompromised patients, 
invasive pulmonary aspergillosis may ensue.11

14.    Rayford Kytle, the spokesperson for the United States Public 
Health Service, reports that scientists at the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) have concluded that existing medical evidence does not 
support continuation of the policy that has allowed a small number of 
cancer, glaucoma, and AIDS patients to smoke marijuana legally.  &quot;NIH  
scientists believe that there are better and safer treatments than smoked 
marijuana for controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea, relieving eye 
pressure caused by Glaucoma, and stimulating the appetites of patients 
with HIV-wasting syndrome,&quot; Kytle has said.10

15.    J. Thomas Ungerleider, M.D., of the UCLA Center for the Health 
Sciences, Department of Psychiatry, has stated the following: 
     A special problem that arises when cannabis or THC is researched is 
the positive and negative bias about the drug that the subject or patient 
brings to the study.  Since it is believed that marijuana effects are 
readily identified, then even in a blind study certain patients might 
detect it, attribute magical powers to the drug, and overreport its 
beneficial impact.  In the large cancer chemotherapy study recently 
completed at UCLA, it was found that 75% of the patients were unable to 
distinguish when they received THC and when they received Compazine.
     One thing is clear:  Marijuana is neither the wonder drug that some 
people have assumed it is, nor the embodiment of evil that others assume.  
If it finally gains some position in the medical armamentarium, it will 
likely be a modest one, providing symptomatic rather than curative 
relief.14

16.    The possible adverse effects of cannabis on health include the 
following: impaired immunity; chromosomal damage; psychopathology 
(including acute panic reaction, toxic delerium, acute paranoid states, 
psychoses, flashbacks, violence, amotivational syndrome, residual 
psychomotor impairment, and brain damage); tolerance and dependence, lung 
problems; cardiovascular problems; eye problems; and effects on driving 
an automobile.15

17.    Harry S. Greenberg, M.D., and others recently studied the effects 
of smoking  marijuana on patients with multiple sclerosis.  &quot;The 
hypothesis of this study was that marijuana smoking would relieve the 
spasticity of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) sufficiently to allow 
better postural control and thus produce a therapeutic 
benefit...Marijuana smoking worsened the dynamic posturography of both 
the patients and the control subjects.  Therefore the hypothesis that 
initiated this research was not confirmed&quot; (emphasis added).16

18.    According to a study on the management of cancer pain in adults 
published in the American Journal of Hospital Pharmacy in 1994, 
cannabinoids are not recommended for the treatment of cancer pain due to 
adverse effects such as dysphoria, drowsiness, hypotension, and 
bradycardia.17
</pre>

<hr>

<pre>
Senator Elaine Szymoniak            Page 5                 March 10, 1995

19.    &quot;Despite initial hopes...the therapeutic use of cannabinoids 
remains limited.&quot;21

20.    Robert E. Peterson, director of Michigan's Office of Drug Control 
Policy, has stated that &quot;there's no...support from the medical community 
when it comes to lifting the medicinal marijuana ban.&quot;1  He and other 
opponents also say that medicalized marijuana is a smoke screen.  &quot;The 
only reason we're having the medical debate is because [advocates] want 
it legalized for recreational use.&quot;1

21.    Lester Grinspoon, M.D., a leading advocate of marijuana's 
medicinal value, admits  that a meaningful marijuana compassionate use 
program would require &quot;an army of bureaucrats...&quot;1

In summary, the Board wishes to emphasize the following:

     &#149;    The survey of oncologists conducted by Richard E. Doblin and 
Mark A. R. Kleiman in 1990 has been questioned and criticized by medical 
practitioners and others.  The findings of the survey may in inaccurate 
and flawed.  As a result, we do not believe that the survey should be 
relied upon.

     &#149;    In regard to research, good data is lacking to prove the 
therapeutic effectiveness of smoking marijuana.  While the Board does not 
oppose research, we believe that it will be difficult for any researcher 
to obtain unbiased data.

     &#149;    Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is a very weak excuse 
for justifying marijuana use.  New drugs, such as ondansetron 
hydrochloride (Zofran), work very well to control nausea and vomiting in 
cancer patients.

     &#149;    Allowing AIDS or cancer patients who are already 
immunocompromised to inhale marijuana smoke only exposes them to 
additional health risks (bacterial infection, lung cancer, etc.).

     &#149;    The purity and consistency of the marijuana product is a 
significant factor.  The dose of active ingredient administered from 
inhalation by smoking cannot be controlled.

     &#149;    The offices of the Iowa Board of Pharmacy Examiners are 
clerical offices.  The Board has no resources or laboratory facilities 
available to it which would allow bench research or scientific 
extrapolation of marijuana products to test for purity or quality.  The 
statement in your letter of February 23, 1995, that &quot;any marijuana 
received [by the board]...shall be made free of impurities and analyzed 
for potency by the board&quot; is not possible due to the limitations of the 
Board's current facilities and level of funding.

     Thank you for understanding the cautious attitude of the Board in 
regard to this issue.  When regulating the practice of pharmacy, the 
Board always strives to take whatever action is necessary to adequately 
promote, preserve, and protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

Sincerely yours,


Lloyd K. Jessen

<PRE> 
 1 A Joint Resolution supporting the use of marijuana for medical 
 2    purposes in the state of Iowa. 
 3    WHEREAS, significant scientific and medical studies have 
 4 demonstrated that marijuana is safe for use under medical 
 5 supervision and that the cannabis plant, in its natural form, has 
 6 important therapeutic benefits that are often of critical medical 
 7 importance to persons afflicted with a variety of life- 
 8 threatening and sense-threatening illnesses; and 
 9    WHEREAS, courts have recognized marijuana's medical value in 
10 treatment and have ruled that marijuana can be a drug of 
11 "necessity" in the treatment of glaucoma, cancer, AIDS, and 
12 multiple sclerosis; and 
13    WHEREAS, the people of the state of Iowa believe that well- 
l4 trained medical professionals rather than remote federal 
15 bureaucrats should be responsible for determining a patient's 
16 medical care routine; and 
17    WHEREAS, seriously ill Iowans and other Americans are 
18 unnecessarily suffering because of federal policies which legally 
19 prohibit marijuana's legitimate medical use; and 
20    WHEREAS, Iowa Code section 124.206, subsection 7, paragraph 
21 "a", enacted in 1979, allows the use of marijuana for medical 
22 purposes in the state of Iowa, expressing the intent of the Iowa 
23 General Assembly that marijuana should be available for 
24 legitimate medical purposes; and 
 
 1    WHEREAS, these problems are not particular to the state of 
 2 Iowa, but generally affect the citizens of all states adversely; 
 3 NOW THEREFORE, 
 4 BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: 
 
 1    That the Iowa General Assembly memorializes the President 
 2 and the United States Congress to end federal prohibitions 
 3 against marijuana's legitimate medical use by creating a 
 4 rational system of prescriptive medical access to marijuana; 
 5 and 
 6    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That copies of this Resolution be 
 7 transmitted to the Honorable Bill Clinton, President of the 
 8 United States; the Honorable Albert Gore, Vice President of 
 9 the United States and President of the United States Senate; 
10 the Honorable Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the United States 
11 House of Representatives; the Honorable Robert Dole, Majority 
12 Leader of the United States Senate; Donna Shalala, Secretary 
13 of the United States Department of Health and Human Services; 
14 Janet Reno, United States Attorney General; and the members of 
15 Iowa's congressional delegation.

<h2 align="center">Medical Marijuana Resolution Faces Opposition</h2>

<h4>Medical marijuana law reform advocates faced their toughest
opposition in the Iowa Legislature this year, proving that we
have become an effective voice. Lack of opposition in prior years
proved that we weren't being taken seriously. In 1993, our
proposal to provide marijuana to patients from supplies
confiscated by state law enforcement sailed through the Iowa
Senate by a vote of 50-0 in favor.</h4>

<p>The Iowa Medical Society sent its lobbyist to the hearing on
our <a href="resolut.html">proposed medical marijuana resolution</a>.
The Iowa Medical Society opposed the use of marijuana for medical
purposes, and was able to persuade the several members of the
committee to reject the <a href="resolut.html">resolution</a> by
a vote of 7-2. </p>

<p>In the Iowa House, the chairman of the House Committee on
Human Resources responded to our request for a hearing by stating
that medical marijuana is not needed because other drugs are available.
The chairman did not respond to our request to identify those
drugs, nor to our rebuttal to his argument, in particular,
salient quotes from the <a
href="http://www.calyx.com/~olsen/MEDICAL/YOUNG/young.html">ruling</a>
of Drug Enforcement Administration chief administrative law judge
Francis L. Young, finding that most or all of the conventional
drugs used for major afflictions are toxic and life-threatening,
while marijuana is one of the safest therapeutic substances known
to man. </p>

<p>In the criminal justice arena, legislation was been introduced
to repeal Iowa's marijuana decriminalization laws. Legislation
under consideration would have increased the penalty for simple possession
of marijuana from a six-month jail term to one year and increase
the penalty for a second conviction for simple possession of
marijuana (within a six-year period) from a six-month jail term
to a two-year prison sentence (as well as increasing the fine
from $1,000 to $5,000 for the second offense). Fortunately, this
legislation failed to make it out of committee. </p>

<p>This year's effort toward repealing decrim follows closely on
the heels of Iowa's marijuana drug tax stamp law which was
enacted in 1990, and Iowa's motor vehicle license suspension or
revocation for marijuana possession law which was enacted in
1993. </p>

<p>We had hoped to enlist the support of the Iowa Civil Liberties
Union (ICLU), whose parent body, the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) is officially on the record as opposing drug
prohibition, but letters to the ICLU regarding medical marijuana
legislation were all unanswered. </p>

<TITLE>Legislative Questionnaire</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><PRE><B><FONT SIZE=6><CENTER>Legislative Questionnaire</CENTER>
Over the past several years, thirty-
seven states have passed legislation
allowing medical patients to receive 
marijuana. Iowa's version was signed 
into law by the Governor of Iowa on 
June 1, 1979, after passing in the 
Iowa Senate by 46 to 0, and in the 
Iowa House by 68 to 26. In March of 
1992, that legislation was 
effectively nullified when the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, the 
only legal source of marijuana in the 
United States, decided to stop the 
supply.  Remedial legislation is 
necessary.

QUESTION: Will you lend your support 
in demanding that the Federal 
Government allow Iowans with 
legitimate medical needs to use 
marijuana for medical purposes?

Yes

No

Not sure

<CENTER>_________________________________________________________________</CENTER>
    On the 23rd day of May 1994, the State's Motion to Strike

Affirmative Defense came before the Court.  The Court, having

reviewed the pleadings, heard the oral arguents of the parties,

and examined the case law provided, makes the following

findings:

    Defendant claims, in her Notice of Affirmative Defense of

Medical Necessity, that the marijuana found in her residence

during a police search was medically necessary to stabilize the

interocular pressure in her left eye, which has glaucoma.

Defendant further claims that there was a specific threat of

immediate harm, that Defendant did not bring about the

circumstances necessitating the illegal act, that no alternative

drug was effective in minimizing the effects of glaucoma, and

that the harm avoided was greater than the harm caused.

Plaintiff argues that the affirmative defense of medical

necessity is not a recognized criminal defense in the State of

Iowa, and so should be stricken.

    The Court finds that the necessity defense, by which the

defendant much choose the lesser of two evils, is a recognized

defense in the state of Iowa.  In <U>State v. Walton</U>, the Iowa

Supreme Court stated that the necessity defense is available

only in emergency situations where the threatened harm is

immediate and the threatened disaster imminent.  311 N.W.2d 113,

115 (Iowa 1981).  Additionally, no alternative option must exist

by which the defendant could avoid both evils.  <U>Id</U>.

    Defendant is entitled to attempt to establish the defense of

necessity.  If the trial judge finds that Defendant has

established the required elements of the necessity defense in

the State of Iowa, the judge may then instruct the defense of

necessity.  The Court declines to rule that the defense of

medical necessity does not exist in the State of Iowa.

    IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that Plaintiff's Motion

to Strike Affirmative Defense is hereby denied.

    DATED this 16th day of June, 1994.

<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>A probation hearing for a Waterloo man who could go to prison for using marijuana for medicinal purposes has been delayed.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Allen Helmers, 48, had been scheduled to be in Black Hawk County District Court Monday.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>His attorney, Tom Frerichs of Waterloo, said a new date has not been set.&nbsp;  It is the second time the hearing has been pushed back.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Helmers has said he believes marijuana is the safest way to relieve pain caused by fibromyalgia syndrome, a disease that attacks the body's soft tissue.&nbsp;  The cause is unknown and there is no cure.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Helmers has already been sentenced to two five-year suspended prison sentences and $1,800 in fines stemming from a police search of his home that uncovered about three ounces of marijuana.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>He was also placed on two to five years of supervised probation, including periodic urine tests.&nbsp;  Because he has continued using marijuana, the probation could be revoked and a prison term could be imposed.

<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Supporters of legislation to allow some medical patients to smoke marijuana rallied at the state Capitol Sunday, calling on lawmakers to "end this insanity" of sending suffering people to prison.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Carl Olsen, director of Iowans for Medical Marijuana also urged the crowd of about 60 to support Allen Helmers of Waterloo, who faces a possible prison term for his use of pot to relieve the pain he suffers as a result of fibromyalgia, a disease that attacks soft tissues.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>"In any war we have to take care of the sick and wounded first," Olsen said of attempts at the national and state level to decriminalize the use of marijuana.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Also at the Capitol were George McMahon of Bode, and Barbara Douglass of Lakeside, two of eight people in the United States legally allowed to smoke marijuana for medical purposes under a federal progam that has been cut back over the last few years.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>"Let's stop this insanity," McMahon said.  "Let's stop them from saying we're a bunch of criminals."  He likened the situation to persecution of the ailing and infirm in Nazi Germany.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>"God put this (marijuana) right here for us," said Douglass.  "Let us have what's already here."
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>McMahon, 46, suffers from congential nailpatella syndrome, which causes abnormalities in the skeletal system and numerous organs throughout the body.  Douglass, 40, has multiple sclerosis
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Olsen called for stepped-up efforts to convince state lawmakers of the benefits of marijuana in medicine, specifically to relieve pain and nausea.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>"The more of those people who hear from you the more likely it is that we'll get something done," Olsen said.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>He added, however, that chances for passage of measures to legalize some medical marijuana uses appear slim in the upcoming legislative session.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Olsen said such a move would have bipartisan support, but not nearly enough.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>He also noted that the more demonstrated public support there is for medical uses of marijuana, the more likely a judge would show leniency in individual cases.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>"modern society doesn't recognize this as a medicine," Olsen said.  "For thousands of years we used nothing but plants for medicine, and now all of a sudden we are so wise that all we need are chemicals that come from the industrial companies."
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Helmers, 48, who has a probation-revocation hearing Oct. 28 because he continues to smoke marijuana, told the rally that current restrictions "force patients into the black market to relieve their pain."
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>"I have talked and cried with many people who have told me of the agonies they have been through watching their loved ones waste away ... when marijuana that could have helped was illegal," Helmers said.  "When compassion and common sense are in confict with the law, then the law is wrong."
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Besides the soft-tissue disease, Helmers said he continues to suffer from back and other injuries he received in several traffic accidents dating back to 198O.  He said more conventional medications do not relieve the pain.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Olsen cited state senators Elaine Syzmoniak, D-Des Moines, and Jim Lind, R-Waterloo, as being among supporters of allowing marijuana to be used by some medical patients.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>But neither were at the rally, and Symoniak in an interview later Sunday, said that although marijuana probably does help some people," she has no intention of sponsoring legislation to allow for its use as a prescription drug.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>"I don't believe in introducing bills that are not going to go any place," Szymioniak said.  "There is very little support for that."
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Lind said he supports such legislation as long as the treatment is under a doctor's supervision and in cases where other medications do not help.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>As for chances of passage, Lind said: "When you're on the side of what's right and you have tenacity, things will pass."

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">WATERLOO -- I would like to congratulate the
Waterloo Courier on the enlightening article regarding the arrest
of Allen Helmers on the use of marijuana for medical
reasons.&nbsp; I, too, am a fibromyalgia sufferer and have other
painful medical conditions in addition, for which there are no cure.&nbsp;
There are a lot of us out here.&nbsp; The fibromyalgia in itself
is devastating, and there are no clear answers for us.&nbsp; The
pain is always there to some degree.&nbsp; Sometimes it is more
manageable than other times. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">I think legislation should be enacted to enable physicians to
prescribe whatever it takes to help people rid themselves of
constant pain, even if only for a little while, a respite you
might say.&nbsp; Fibromyalgia is not a terminal disease, but it
feels like it.&nbsp; I've often wondered if perhaps people like
me are making the Dr. Kevorkians of the world more popular.&nbsp;
A person can handle only so much pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">Mr. Helmers, I'm sure, has all he can do dealing with the pain,
and I think it's ridiculous that our laws have allowed him to be
arrested for something that's helping him &quot;live.&quot;&nbsp;
I empathize with him, and I support him.&nbsp; Let's not be so
paranoid about drugs that we will not allow our physicians to prescribe
something to alleviate the pain and suffering. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">CEDAR FALLS -- Allen Helmers was the focus of a
front-page article concerning his use of marijuana for medical
purposes only.&nbsp; I, too, suffer from Fibromyalgia Syndrome of
which there is no cure or treatment found.&nbsp; I can no longer
work, and many activities are impossible because of this
ailment.&nbsp; I was a business owner and had steady employment
until this took over my life.&nbsp; My life no long belongs to
me. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">Fibromyalgia (FMS) controls me with overall constant pain, total
exhaustion and fatigue.&nbsp; I never get a rested night's
sleep.&nbsp; No rested sleep results in many other side effects
including mental confusion.&nbsp; I must be careful not to
overdue any activity or I suffer the consequences greatly.&nbsp;
I have tried all the popular medications prescribed from several
different specialists with no avail.&nbsp; Not only do the
medications I have tried not work, but they also can have some
severe side effects which just compound already a bad situation
to the impossible. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">FMS is an invisible disease.&nbsp; I look healthy.&nbsp; No one
sees my suffering which affects my muscle, ligaments and
tendons.&nbsp; But, taking into account the benefits that are
attained by using marijuana for medical reasons, I feel that this
should be prescribed by physicians to alleviate the discomfort
and pain caused by many diseases. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">I fully understand marijuana for recreational use being
illegal.&nbsp; I'm against alcohol for the same reason.&nbsp; But
to let people suffer is inhumane.&nbsp; Those who are of the same
opinion and want to help further the cause and have marijuana
approved as a legal drug to be used for medical purposes only,
should contact the statewide group of Iowans for Medical
Marijuana.&nbsp; A rally will be held in Des Moines on Oct. 6 for
the medical marijuana user's plight.&nbsp; Their address is P.O.

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">EVANSDALE &#151; As a fibromyalgia sufferer, I
was compelled to respond to the arrest of Allen Helmers for the
use of marijuana for medical reasons.&nbsp; Researchers
haven&#146;t been able to find a cause or cure.&nbsp; The
government needs to grant more money for research.&nbsp; I
currently take several pills a day which are not helping the pain
and suffering.&nbsp; I don&#146;t like taking all this medication
with varying side effects.&nbsp; The results of all these
medications can be life threatening.&nbsp; I struggle with the grief
over the loss of physical and mental abilities that I used to
take for granted.&nbsp; I am very frustrated with the limitations
this syndrome causes in my life.&nbsp; I am never free of pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">Many doctors need to be thoroughly educated on the reality of
what fibromyalgia is.&nbsp; It is founded that the medical use of
marijuana has been very effective in relieving discomfort and
pain for many who suffer from other illnesses also (cancer, AIDS,
epilepsy, etc.).&nbsp; Our medical communities need to be well
informed so they can understand the need we have for a substance that
can alleviate pain for so many and possibly give them back some
quality of life.&nbsp; Laws must be passed to enable our medical
community to have the right to prescribe any drug or substance
that will open a new avenue of relief for those who suffer from
chronic pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">The use of marijuana would indeed have a significant reduction in
the amount of non-beneficial prescription drugs with harmful side
effects.&nbsp; Marijuana cannot be any worse that the medications we
are prescribed.&nbsp; Why is it not available to the medical
community?</p>

<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>A probation-revocation hearing has been delayed for a Waterloo man who could go to prison for using marijuana for medicinal purposes.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Allen Helmers, 48, had been scheduled to be in Black Hawk County District Court Monday afternoon for a hearing that could have ended with him being sent to prison.  The hearing, however, was delayed and is now rescheduled for Oct. 28.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Helmers has said his doctor believes marijuana is the only thing that can effectively relieve pain caused by fibromyalgia syndrome, a disease that attacks the bodys soft tissue.  The cause is unknown and there is no cure.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Previously, Helmers was sentenced to two five-year suspended prison sentences and $1,800 in fines stemming from a police search of his home that uncovered about three ounces of marijuana he was using to ease the pain from his condition.

Dear Carl, <br>
<br>
Enclosed please find copies of the </font><a href="casella3.html"><font
size="4">letter I have written to the Black Hawk County District
Court</font></a><font size="4"> concerning Allen Helmers, and
also the </font><a href="casella2.html"><font size="4">letter
that I have sent to the Waterloo Courier</font></a><font size="4">
thanking them for the article on Allen.&nbsp; I hope that they
are satisfactory as I feel like I am terribly uninformed.&nbsp; I
have been, like so many others, busy raising my family and
working for the last twenty years, stupidly trusting the powers
that be to do what is right (those days are over!).&nbsp; So,
now, I will learn all that I can, and I will do what I can to
fight for freedom. <br>
<br>
As I say above, I am uninformed, I do not understand your
reference to Charles Larson and the Saudi Arabian highway partol? <br>
<br>
I will take notes on the proceedings concerning Allen H. and will
write something up and send it to you.&nbsp; And, like I said
before, anything else?&nbsp; Also, any suggestions that will help
my letter writing would be greatly appreciated. <br>
<br>
Thanks! <br>

&quot;Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest

Helmers sits rigidly on cement steps that lead to the front porch
of his weathered, white duplex on the city's east side.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Just above his head, a pair of
skinny cats lounge behind the screened windows, eyes closed, ears
twitching to pick up even the smallest sound from the street.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Helmers adjusts his black reading
glasses and shifts his weight uncomfortably.&nbsp; It's a little
after 1 p.m., and he's hurting.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;I can't sit like this very
long,&quot; he says.&nbsp; &quot;Pretty soon, I have to recline
or lay down or it starts killing me.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Before he reclines, Helmers, 48,
will fill a small pipe with marijuana and inhale deeply.&nbsp;
His doctor says it's the only thing that effectively relieves the
throbbing pain of fibromyalgia syndrome, which attacks the body's
soft tissue.&nbsp; Neither cause nor cure is known.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Seconds after his fourth
&quot;hit&quot; of the day, the pain in Helmers' back and legs
will begin to subside, and he can think about something else.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Like spending as much as 10 years
in prison.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;If they send me into the
system, I'll be one hell of an expensive prisoner,&quot; he
says.&nbsp; You know, disabled people have rights, too.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Helmers survived a semi roll-over
in 1983 that left him with a broken back.&nbsp; In 1994, he was
hit by an uninsured drunken driver while riding his motorcycle,
resulting in an ugly mass of purplish zipper scars crisscrossing
his lower left leg, where the flesh has been stretched
haphazardly over repaired bones.</div><br>

<font size="-1" face="Arial">Continued from page 1</font> <multicol
cols="3" gutter="10" width="100%"> <spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">But
six months before the second accident, on a cold February night,
police burst into Helmers' house with a search warrant.&nbsp; He
says they were looking for powdered methamphetamine, having
traced the drug to a man who rented the other half of the duplex.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">But the search yielded the 90 grams
(about three ounces) of marijuana Helmers had on hand to keep the
pain at bay.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;I knew better than to have
that much at once,&quot; he says.&nbsp; &quot;Anything less than
44 grams would have been a misdemeanor.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Helmers stash cost him two
five-year prison sentences and $1,800 in fines and court
costs.&nbsp; The prison terms were suspended, and he was placed
on two to five years of supervised probation, which includes
periodic urine tests.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;I didn't lie; I told them the
(tests) would be dirty,&quot; he says.&nbsp; &quot;I wasn't going
to stop smoking; I couldn't.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">His doctor, W.H. Verduyn of
Waterloo, says Helmers' pain does &quot;not seem to respond to
the usual medical management.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">According to Helmers, more potent
prescribed pain relievers have not only failed, hut caused
everything from stomach ulcers to impotence and memory loss.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;Marijuana gives me the best
relief from the pain and muscle spasms without the debilitating
side effects of the other drugs,&quot; he says.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">It even allows him the mobility to
mow lawns for elderly friends and give horseback rides to
neighbor kids.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Dr Verduyn, of Physical &amp;
Rehabilitation Associates of NE Iowa Inc., says he knows many
patients who use marijuana to reduce chronic pain, with the only
side effect being &quot;a significant reduction of the other pain
medications.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;It has been known in the
medical field, particularly in the area of rehabilitation, that
chronic neurogenic pain responds well to the medicinal use of
marijuana,&quot; he says.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Across the country, the same case
has been made for people suffering with AIDS, cancer, glaucoma,
epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and other maladies.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">But there are only eight people in
the United States who can legally smoke marijuana for medical
reasons.&nbsp; All were given permission - and are supplied the
drug - under a federal program that was shut down by the Bush
administration in 1992, two years before Helmers took a friend's
7-year-old son &quot;for a little ride on the motorcycle.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">It was 3:30 p.m., in the 1900 block
of Independence Avenue.&nbsp; The woman driving the car that
struck them was determined to be legally drunk.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;The bones came spraying out
of my leg, and I busted the bottom two vertebrae that still
haven't healed,&quot; Helmers remembers.&nbsp; &quot;The little
kid landed on my lap, he got a couple of stitches.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;We had an angel with
us.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Helmers is hoping the angel will be
in the Black Hawk County Courthouse Sept. 16.&nbsp; That's when
he goes before a judge at a probation revocation hearing.&nbsp;
An unfavorable decision will send him to prison.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">But even if he's lucky, and
probation is continued, he won't stop smoking pot.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;In good conscience, if need
be I will do my time, but I don't and can't feel like a criminal
because I use a substance that enables me to at least function
part-time,&quot; he says.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Not surprisingly, Helmers' plight
has come to the attention of Iowans for Medical Marijuana, and
his story has been posted on the Internet.&nbsp; A lawyer in
Philadelphia has reportedly offered his services.&nbsp; The
statewide group has invited Helmers to a rally at the state
Capitol on Oct. 6.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">If he's not in jail.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;I will battle the best I can,
but I know if I'm locked up and deprived of my medicine, I'll go
downhill fast,&quot; Helmers says.&nbsp; &quot;I can only hope
that my suffering might somehow help someone else down the road.<br>

Lord.&quot; </multicol></div> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>Dear Carl, I am a 48-year-old single male
on disability because of Chronic Pain Syndrome &amp; Fibromyalgia
brought on by my breaking my back in two places in 1981.&nbsp; I
have since broken a total of three more vertabrea and my lower leg
in 14 places when struck from behind by an uninsured drunk driver
in August of 1994 while on my motorcycle.&nbsp; I have been
operated on 16 times to save my left foot which left my leg over
an inch shorter which agravates the broken vertabrea in my lower
back, two of which are not healed and will probably require
surgery.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>I have tried every remedy the doctors could
give me to find little or no relief and unbearable side effects, memory
loss, impotence, stomach bleeding and ulcerations, and other
troubling symptoms, and I've found that marijuana gives me the
best relief from the pain and muscle spasms without the
debilitating side effects of the other drugs.&nbsp; It even
allows me to do some part time work at lawn mowing which I
couldn't do without it.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>In February 1994 the Tri-County Task Force
invaded my homw with a warrant for green stuff, white powder,
drug records, and any assets resulting from drug trade.&nbsp; I
gave them the 90 grams of pot I had and was hand-cuffed.&nbsp;
They proceeded to ransack my house and badger me all the time, refusing
me a call to a lawyer.&nbsp; I was accused of being a major meth
dealer according to their reliable informant, although after two
hours of searching my one-bedroom apartment, they could find no
trace of anything to do with powder.&nbsp; I told them, and I
have maintained since, that I use pot for medical reasons and I
don't abuse it and I don't deal it.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>I was put on probation for 2 to 5 years
intensive, suspended two 5 year sentences and given $1800 in penalties
to pay to the court.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>With the pain I must endure I have not been
able to stay away from pot, I need the relief.&nbsp; It has put
me in trouble with Court Services and I am now being violated and
going back to court to hear my fate in a few weeks.&nbsp; I never
lied to my probation officer and admitted without urinalysis that
I would be dirty and tried to give him the best information I
could find on my medical conditions so he might be able to
understand what I live through every day.&nbsp; Fibromyalgia has
the same level of pain and is as disabling as Rheumatoid
Arthritis.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>I have found a </tt></font><a
href="verduyn.html"><font size="4"><tt>doctor</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt> who says marijuana is the best and safest thing I
can take for this problem because when you get into the pain
drugs for chronic disorders you have to face the toxicity
problem, the pain killers themselves will end up killing me.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>So in good conscience if it need be I will
do my time, but I don't and I can't feel like I'm a criminal
because I use a substance that enables me to at least function
part time.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>The drunken driver who ran me down was
given 7 days in jail and 18 months probation.&nbsp; Tell me where
the justice is?&nbsp; I don't see it.&nbsp; I will remember her
deed with every step I ever take because of the pain she left me
with.</tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>I will battle my afflictions the best I can
as I have, but I know being locked up and deprived of the
medicine I need I know I will go down hill fast.&nbsp; I can only
hope my suffering might somehow help someone else down the road. </tt></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="4"><tt>If anyone has any advise or help feel free
to contact me.&nbsp; Help is direly needed as being laid up this
long has drained me financially and emotionally and my time is running
out.&nbsp; I leave it in God's hands now.&nbsp; Thank you. </tt></font></p>

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Mr. Helmers is a patient in our
office.&nbsp; He has a significant past history because of
multiple motorcycle and car accidents dating back to 1980.&nbsp;
In August 1994 he was hit by a drunk driver when he was on his
motorcycle and had a fracture of his left lower leg.&nbsp; He has significant
complaints of pain which do not seem to respond to the usual
medical management.&nbsp; He has been seen in the Chronic Pain
Program.&nbsp; Mr. Helmers reports to me that he gets relief when
he smokes marijuana. </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>It has been known in the medical field,
particularly in the area of rehabilitation, that chronic
neurogenic pain responds well to the medicinal use of
marijuana.&nbsp; The amount of marijuana is low and the effect is
significant causing much less side effects than the standard pain medications. </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>We have utilized a number of routine and
not so routine medications to manage his pain, none of which has
been successful. </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Although marijuana is not legally approved
for use in pain treatment, I know that many chronic pain patients
utilize it without problems just to manage their pain with a significant
reduction of the other pain medications. </tt></font></p>

<H1><CENTER>Virginia Nurses Back Pot-by-Prescription</CENTER></H1>

   The Virginia Nurses Association (VNA) has called for an end to federal laws which prohibit marijuana's medical use.<P>
   The resolution, sponsored by the VNA Council of District Presidents, the Ethics Committee and the Committee on Preserving the Rights of HIV-Infected Persons, received overwhelming support from the organization's Delegate Assembly during VNA's October meeting.<P>
   Noting nurses "have an ethical obligation to be advocates for health care" the VNA said it will support "all reasonable efforts to end federal policies which prohibit or unnecessarily restrict marijuana's legal availability for legitimate medical uses."<P>
   Mary Lynn Mathre, RN, MSN, a nurse at the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, called the VNA resolution, "An important decision which places nurses squarely on the side of seriously ill Americans who could benefit from legal, medically supervised access to marijuana."<P>
   Marijuana has medical value in the treatment of several life- and sense-threatening diseases, including cancer, glaucoma and AIDS.  Federal law, however, still prohibits marijuana's prescriptive medical use.  Only eight Americans have legal access to medical marijuana.<P>
   The Virginia Nurses Association is the first major nursing organization to endorse marijuana's prescriptive medical use.  The powerful California Medical Association has also called for pot-by-prescription.<P>
   "People with cancer and AIDS should receive marijuana in a medically appropriate fashion," said Nurse Mathre.  "We believe nursing organizations all over America will follow the Virginia Nurses Association lead and begin to address this problem."

<H1><CENTER>Medical Marijuana in Australia</CENTER></H1>
   Australia has suddenly taken the lead in the rapidly accelerating global debate over marijuana's medical use.<P>
   Last November, politicians in the Australian Capital Territory voted to  allow doctors to determine when marijuana is medically appropriate.  The  decision enraged the Australian Federal Police and intensive lobbying efforts began to reverse the legislative action.  In a scene that has become all too familiar, legislators caved-in to the demands of the police, reversed their earlier action, and voted to block doctors from legally prescribing marijuana.<P>
   Despite this political confusion the med-pot debate has rapidly spread to other Australian states.  According to numerous press accounts, Australian physicians, backed by AIDS and cancer groups, are supporting political moves to end the medical prohibition of marijuana.  Similar political actions are being planned in New South Wales and West Australia.<P>
   "Most Australians think doctors and patients -- not bureaucrats and vice cops -- should decide when marijuana is medically needed," said Robert Randall, president of the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT).  Randall called reversal of the Australian Capital Territory action, "A shocking, even frightening display of overt police interference in the political process, and in the practice of medicine."<P>
   Australian efforts to end the medical prohibition of marijuana are part of a rapidly expanding global debate over the inexpensive plant's therapeutic importance.  Among recent global developments:<P>
<UL>
<LI>In February 1994, the British Medical Association reported 70% of physicians in the United Kingdom think marijuana should be legally available by prescription.<P>
<LI>The powerful California Medical Association has endorsed marijuana's prescriptive medical use in the treatment of life- and sense-threatening diseases including AIDS, cancer and glaucoma.<P>
<LI>Dutch authorities have recognized that social coffee shops are not an adequate response to the AIDS crisis.  As a result, Holland is working to establish legal means so Dutch physicians can prescribe marijuana to desperately ill patients.<P>
<LI>U.S. courts in several states have already ruled marijuana can be a drug of "medical necessity" in the treatment of AIDS, glaucoma and multiple sclerosis.<P>
<LI>Thirty-five U.S. states have voted to end the prohibition of medical marijuana.  U.S. drug police, however, have strongly resisted political efforts to expand marijuana's medical availability.<P>
<LI>A 1991 Harvard survey of U.S. cancer specialists found 44% of American oncologists privately advise patients to break the law to obtain medically needed marijuana.
</UL>
   "There is a growing global awareness of marijuana's tremendous medical importance," Randall said.  "In Australia we are witnessing the first political efforts beyond the United States to replace Reefer Madness with a more sane and humane system of physician-mediated medical access to marijuana."

<H1><CENTER>Scientists advocate marijuana for the ill</CENTER></H1>
   The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) has called on the federal government to aggressively research marijuana's medicinal use for the seriously ill.<P>
   In a November 15, 1994, petition to Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, the FAS pointed out that whole cannabis is already in clinical use by patients suffering a variety of illnesses, including AIDS and epilepsy.<P>
   The Federation, in a one-sentence petition, said: "based on much evidence from patients and doctors alike on the superior effectiveness and safety of whole cannabis ... we hereby petition the Executive Branch and the Congress to facilitate and expedite the research necessary to determine whether this substance should be licensed for medical use by seriously ill persons."<P>
   In releasing the petition, the Federation noted that it did not have a policy on whether the law should be changed with regard to non-medical uses of marijuana.<P>
   It said it simply wanted to ensure that the research necessary to determine whether marijuana should be legally available for extremely ill persons was completed promptly.

<H1><CENTER>LEGAL NEWS</CENTER></H1>
   The number of seriously ill Americans arrested and/or harassed for possession of marijuana continues to grow.<P>
<H3>California</H3>
   In Santa Cruz, despite the passage of Measure A in 1993, police seized the marijuana plants of 33 year-old quadriplegic Scott Hager.  Measure A recognizes marijuana's medical value and prohibits local authorities from prosecuting those with a medical need for the plant.<P>
   Local police seized four plants from Hager in September.  No charges were
brought but Hager, fed-up with policeman acting as doctors, has decided to go on the offensive.  He has filed suit in local court challenging the constitutionality of the State's medical prohibition.<P>
   Two other Californians have faced harassment by local police.  Sister Somayah Kambui of Los Angeles was the victim of a mistaken police raid in June.  The soft-spoken woman suffers from sickle cell anemia and argues marijuana helps ease the pain of that disease.<P>
   Police mistakenly raider her home when they actually possessed a warrant for a downstairs apartment.<P>
   They seized one six inch seedling.  Initially charged with a felony, charges were later reduced to a misdemeanor and then dropped.<P>
   Barbara Sweeney has twice watched the police raid her home and remove her medicine.  The 40 year-old AIDS patient lives in Marin County where the Board of Supervisors has endorsed medical access to marijuana.  In July 1994, the police seized 12 plants from Sweeney.  No charges were brought because them was no warrant.<P>
<H3>Maryland</H3>
   In Charles County, Maryland, 43 year-old Jerome Mensch was not so fortunate.  Like Sweeney, Mensch suffers from AIDS.  In November 1994, local police searched his dairy farm with a warrant and found enough marijuana for about ten cigarettes.  Mensch, who cooperated completely with the police, then led the officials to four plants that were growing on the property.  Trial is expected in 1995.<P>
<H3>What to do?</H3>
   If you are arrested for marijuana possession and you have a medical need for the drug there is the possibility that you can claim the defense of medical necessity.  This defense is not easy.  It is highly specific to the individual charged.  There are two basic points: 1) you must have a medical condition responsive to marijuana-based therapies and 2) the condition must be beyond the reach of conventional, legally available medications.  In other words, it isn't enough to simply choose to use marijuana.  You must demonstrate that marijuana has significant advantages over conventional medications.<P>
   The Alliance recommends that those with a medical need for marijuana take the necessary steps to create a strong record of medical use.  Inform your doctor and ask that he or she make a note in your medical records.  Prepare a statement of how marijuana is helpful, when you began using it, why it is better than other medications, etc.  Have that statement notarized and keep a copy with your important documents.  You may want to ask your doctor to put a copy of this statement in your file.<P>
   These steps will begin to create a record of your need for medical access to marijuana.  You may also want to keep a log documenting how your condition changes when you are unable to obtain supplies of marijuana.<P>
   Until compassion and common sense prevail it will be necessary for those with a medical need for marijuana to take steps such as those outlined above.  It may be a little extra work but it could save you a jail term in the future.

<H4>* Two states, Louisiana and Maine, have enacted legislation on two different occasions which recognize marijuana's therapeutic utility.  Louisiana originally enacted legislation in May 1978 which called for a state program of legal access for victims of cancer and glaucoma.  In July 1991 this law was amended to included victims of paralysis.  In Maine, the legislature first enacted a bill in August 1979 which was similar to that of New Mexico.  In 1992, the Maine legislature enacted a bill which allowed for cultivation of a small amount of marijuana for medical purposes.  This bill was vetoed by the govemor and the legislature failed to override the veto.  It has been reported to the Alliance that Alaska passed legislation in the early 1980s recognizing marijuana's medical value.  ACT is unable to provide further details on this legislation.</H4>

<CENTER><H4>Significant Legal Cases</H4></CENTER>
   While federal agencies adamantly maintain marijuana has "no accepted medical use in treatment in the United States," the medical prohibition has come under strong legal challenge from seriously ill Americans who have been arrested on marijuana-related charges.<P>
<P>

<B><I>U.S. v. Randall</I></B><P>

   In 1976, a Washington, D.C. man afflicted by glaucoma employed the little-used Common Law doctrine of necessity to defend himself against criminal charges of marijuana cultivation.  On November 24, 1976, federal Judge James Washington ruled Randall's use of marijuana constituted a "medical necessity."  In part, Judge Washington ruled:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>   While blindness was shown by competent medical testimony to be the otherwise inevitable result of defendant's disease, no adverse effects from the smoking of marijuana have been demonstrated....  Medical evidence suggests that the medical prohibition is not well-founded.<SUP>65</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

   Judge Washington dismissed criminal charges against Randall.  Concurrent with this judicial determination, federal agencies responding to a May, 1976 petition filed by Randall, began providing this patient with licit, FDA-approved access to government supplies of medical marijuana.  Randall was the first American to receive marijuana for the treatment of a medical disorder.<P>
<P>

<B><I>Randall v. U.S.</I></B><P>

    In 1978, federal agencies, disquieted by Randall's outspoken opposition to the medical prohibition, sought to silence him by disupting his legal access to marijuana.<SUP>66</SUP><P>

   In response, Randall, represented <I>pro bono publico</I> by the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson, brought suit against FDA, DEA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Department of Justice and the Department of Health, Education & Welfare.<P>

   Twenty-four hours after the suit was filed, federal agencies requested an out-of-court settlement.  The resulting settlement provided Randall with prescriptive access to marijuana through a federal pharmacy located near his home.<P>

   The settlement in <I>Randall v. U.S.</I> became the legal basis for FDA's Compassionate IND program.  Initially, this program was limited to patients afflicted by marijuana-responsive disorders and some orphan drugs.  In the mid-1980's however, the Compassionate IND concept was expanded to include HIV-positive people seeking legal access to drugs which had not yet received final FDA marketing approval.<P>

<H5>66   President Carter's drug advisor, Peter Bourne went so far as to threaten Randall.  In a June 6, 1977 letter Bourne told Randall, "Publicity in this case has forced consideration of tightenig up the dispensing of your supplies."  Direct Testimony of Robert Randa11, Marijuana, Medicine & the Law, Vol I, p. 36 at 104.</H5>

<B>In the Matter of Craig Reichart</B><P>

   In response to pleas from the parents of a young man afflicted with terminal cancer, Imperial County Superior Court Judge Don Work issued three orders to facilitate the legal availability of marijuana to treat the symptoms of nausea, vomiting and weight loss.  Judge Work ordered the sheriff of Imperial Court to provide the young man's physician with contraband supplies of marijuana; immunized the physician from criminal liability for possessing the marijuana and for dispensing it to the patient; immunized the patient from criminal liability for possessing the marijuana provided to him by his treating physician.<P>
<P>

<B>State of Washington v. Diana</B><P>

   A man afflicted by multiple sclerosis (MS) was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana.  At trial, Sam Diana argued his use of marijuana was a "medical necessity".  The court refused to hear medical evidence and convicted Diana.  The Washington Court of Appeals overturned the verdict and returned the case to the lower court for retrial.  The Appeals Court ruled that "medical necessity" was a valid defense and instructed the lower court to consider evidence of Diana's medical need.67<P>

   On retrial Diana presented testimony from numerous medical experts, his treating physicians, his family and other multiple sclerosis patients who endorsed marijuana's medical value in relieving severe muscle spasms.  The Court concluded that Diana was "not guilty by reason of medical necessity."<P>
<P>

<B>State of Florida v. Musikka</B><P>

   A middle-aged woman afflicted with glaucoma was arrested for growing six marijuana plants.  At trial, Musikka, who had already lost sight in one eye as a result of failed surgical interventions, argued her use of marijuana was a "medical necessity."  Musikka's treating physician, a noted ophthalmic researcher at Miami's famous Bascom-Palmer Eye Institute testified that "if marijuana were legal I would have prescribed it for Elvy Musikka's medical use in the treatment of glaucoma."  He further testified that, without marijuana, Musikka would go blind.<P>

   The Court, after hearing from other medical experts, concluded Musikka's use of marijuana was protected by the Common Law defense of "medical necessity" and found Ms. Musikka not guilty.  In reaching this verdict, Judge Mark E. Pollin wrote:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    This is an intolerable, untenable legal situation.  Unless legislators and regulators heed these urgent human needs and rapidly move to correct the anomaly arising from the absolute prohibition of marijuana which forces law abiding citizens into the streets - and criminality - to meet their legitimate medical needs, cases of this type will become increasingly common in coming years.  There is a pressing need for a more compassionate, humane law which clearly discriminates between the criminal conduct of those who socially abuse chemicals and the legitimate medical needs of seriously ill patients whose welfare and very lives may depend on the prudent therapeutic use of those very same chemical substances.<SUP>68</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<H5>67   Washington v. Diana, Superior Court, Spokane Washington, March 4, 1981.</H5>

<H5>68   Florida v. Musikka, 17th Judicial Circuit, Broward County Florida, Case No. 68 4395 CFA 10, The Florida Law Weekly, 14 FL W 1 (January 27, 1989).</H5>
<HR>

<B>U.S. v. Burton</B><P>

   Mr. Burton, a glaucoma patient, argued his use of marijuana was a "medical necessity."  Testimony was received from Burton's personal physician, an ophthalmic physician who had researched marijuana's use in glaucoma therapy, from his uncle who was blinded by glaucoma, and from relatives and others who testified to Burton's good character and work habits.  The jury refused to convict Burton on the felony charge of marijuana cultivation with intent to distribute, but found him guilty of simple, misdemeanor possession.  A Reagan-appointed federal judge, however, sentenced Burton, a Vietnam veteran with no prior criminal record, to serve one year in federal prison.  Federal drug agencies seized Burton's home, truck and farmland.  After serving his criminal sentence, Burton and his wife fled the United States.  The couple now live in Holland, where Burton can legally obtain the marijuana he medically requires.<P>
<P>

<B>State of Minnesota v. Gordon Hanson</B><P>

   A man suffering from epilepsy was arrested for growing marijuana.  At trial he argued his use of marijuana was "medically necessary" to control debilitating seizures.  Research neurologists from New York and Washington, D.C. testified that Hanson's use of marijuana was medically appropriate.  The local court dismissed this medical testimony and found Hanson guilty.  On appeal, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that "medical necessity" could not be used as a defense against criminalization for marijuana cultivation.  The ruling drew sharp editorial criticism from many local newspapers.  Hanson served nearly one year in prison.  During that time he had numerous gran mal and petite mal seizures.<P>
<P>

<B>State of Florida v. Kenneth & Barbra Jenks</B><P>

   Kenny Jenks, a hemophilic, and his wife, Barbra, were arrested in March, 1990 for growing two marijuana plants.  They were charged with three felony counts.  At trial, however, the young couple revealed they both were infected by the deadly AIDS virus, and argued that their use of marijuana was "medically necessary" to control the nausea, vomiting and rapid weight loss caused by advanced HIV-infection.  The local court refused to heed medical testimony from their treating physician and other experts and they were convicted on all three felony charges.<P>

   In April, 1991, the Florida Court of Appeals reversed the lower court, overturned the young couple's criminal conviction and ruled their use of marijuana was a "medical necessity" in the treatment of AIDS.  In October, 1991 the Florida Supreme Court upheld the Appeals Court's verdict and ordered the prosecutor to file no further appeals in the landmark case.<P>
<P>

<B>State of Idaho v. Hastings</B><P>

   A woman afflicted by crippling arthritis was arrested for growing a few marijuana plants.  At trial she argued her use of marijuana was "medically necessary" to control the debilitating pain caused by her arthritis.  Her treating physician, other patients afflicted by chronic pain and muscle spasm, testified in her defense.  The local court refused to consider the medical evidence, but withheld judgement.  On appeal the Idaho Supreme Court ruled the defendant did have the right to "introduce evidence relating to the common law defense of necessity".  The Court ordered the lower court to consider all evidence of Ms. Hasting's medical needs.  At this juncture the prosecutor dropped all criminal charges against Ms. Hastings.<P>

<p><font size="4">PRESS RELEASE<br>
<br>
Patients Out of Time is pleased to announce that the American
Nurses Association (ANA), has taken action towards recognizing
the right of patients to use CANNABIS as medicine. Access to
theraputic CANNABIS is already endorsed by numerous professional
health care organizations.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The American Nurses Association, The United
States member of the International Council of Nurse, has informed
the Virginia Nurses Association that a position paper submitted
by the Virginia Nurses Association titled &quot;Theraputic Use of
Cannabis&quot; has been favorably reviewed by the ANA's Congress
of Nursing Practice.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The theraputic CANNABIS resolution which was
followed by a position paper were initiated by Mary Lynn Mathre
RN, MSN, Carn the senoir nurse consultant for addictions
treatment services at the University of Virginia's Medical Center
in Charlottesville. &quot;The position paper on theraputic CANABIS&quot;
was submitted to the ANA from a patient advocacy position, which
is a primary function of the nursing profession. Once made aware
of the theraputic potential of CANNABIS and it's relative safety,
Nurses readily support the right of Patients to access this medicine&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The twofold motion adopted by the Congress of
Nursing Practice calls for the education of all RN's regarding
current evidence based on theraputic uses of CANNABIS; and the
investigation of the theraputic efficacy of CANNABIS in controlled
trials. Mathre added that this is a defacto statement by the ANA
that marijuana has medical value; a way of showing support for
similar resolutions passed by other US health care organizations;
and should be recognized by the US government as a polite way of
calling the denial of marijuana as medicine for the sick and dieing
as illogical. With one out of every 40 registered voters a nurse
we should expect the politicians might pay close attention to
what the Nurses of America are demanding.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The State nursing association of Virginia,
Mississipi, Colorado, New York, and California as well as the
American Public Health Association, the National Nurses Society
on Addictions and some two dozen other groups have all voiced
their demand for the administration of theraputic cannabis to be
allowed by primary care providers rather than denied to the sick
by prosecuters and their laws. Patients Out of Time, a nonprofit organization
comprised of five of the eight legal marijuana patients and experts
in the theraputic Cannabis field, either crafted or was a consultant
to these organizations.</font></p>

<PRE>
     In October of 1994 the Virginia Nurses Association joined Patients 
Out of Time in crafting a resolution calling for the immediate 
availability of therapeutic cannabis - medical marijuana for the sick.  
This demand echoed that of a sister organization the Virginia Nurses 
Society on Addictions who first voiced the needs of physicians to be able 
to prescribe cannabis as a medicine in August of 1993.  In May of 1995 
the National Nurses Society on Addictions (NNSA) joined this call to 
compassion.  The sponsor of the VA resolutions, Mary Lynn Mathre RN, an 
expert in substance abuse and consultant in that field to the University 
of Virginia's Health Sciences Center, said of the NNSA resolution, "This 
is a clear demonstration that addiction experts and specialists 
understand that cannabis has potential therapeutic value and patients 
should be allowed access to this medicine."

     The Mississippi Nurses Association passed a therapeutic cannabis 
resolution in October of 1995 as did the Colorado Nurses Association in 
November 1995.  Also in November the annual conference of the American 
Public Health Association issued their demand for therapeutic cannabis, 
to be published in their March 1996 journal, after "sailing through" the 
voting process according to their representative.  Patients Out of Time 
either prepared or spoke for all of these resolutions.

     Patients Out of Time is an organization that recognizes the need for 
some patients to be accorded the compassion and dignity to alleviate 
their pain and sickness by using a natural plant, cannabis, under a 
doctor's care.  Patients Out of Time is composed of legal and illegal 
cannabis using patients; health care professionals; and tolerant but 
affirmative citizens who desire a pro choice modality of treatment for 
the ill and dying.

     Mary Lynn Mathre RN, MSN, CARN, president of Patients Out of Time 
will be presenting "Therapeutic Cannabis & the Law: Ethical Dilemma for 
Nurses" at the 100th Anniversary Conference of the American Nurses 
Association on June 17th, 1996 in Washington, DC.  With her will be 
Barbara Douglass, a Director of Patients Out of Time and one of eight 
legal marijuana patients and Irvin Rosenfeld, the second patient to 
receive U.S. Government supplied marijuana and National Spokesman for 
Patients Out of Time.  Contact Patients Out of Time at (804) 263-4484 or

Dear Governor Wilson:<P>

The California Nurses Association supports <B>AB 1529</B> (Vasconcellos) which would eliminate California's prohibition against possessing marijuana or growing marijuana for individuals using marijuana for medical purposes.<P>

Many patients suffering from and receiving treatment for cancer, AIDS, glaucoma and multiple sclerosis receive relief from using marijuana.  Marijuana helps patients with nausea, vomiting and muscle spasms where other medications are not effective.  Currently, these patients must break the law to use marijuana to relieve their symptoms.  This measure is a compassionate alternative for patients suffering from these diseases to obtain relief.<P>

For these reasons, the California Nurses Association supports <B>AB 1529</B> and respectfully requests your signature.<P>

Sincerely,<P>

Kurt Laumann, RN<BR>
President<P>

       THE NEW YORK STATE NURSES ASSOCIATION

     Position Statement on Medicinal Marijuana


The New York State Nurses Association Board of
Directors, at its meeting of June 7, 1995, endorsed
the Virginia State Nurses Association resolution
regarding Legalizing Marijuana for Medical Purposes
(see attached).

According to the Virginia Nurses Society on
Addictions, as a Schedule I drug, marijuana cannot be
used by patients or prescribed by health care
providers.  Marijuana has been found to be effective
in the treatment of glaucoma by reducing intraocular
pressure and in reducing nausea and vomiting caused
by chemotherapy.  Marijuana has also been effective
in stimulating the appetite of AIDS patients
suffering from the wasting syndrome, controlling
spasticity in spinal cord injury patients and in
controlling seizures for persons suffering from
epilepsy and for persons with multiple sclerosis.
Marijuana is remarkably non-toxic and the estimated
lethal dose is 20,000 to 40,000 times a normal dose.

In New York state, Marijuana cannot be used by
patients or prescribed by health care providers.
Public Health Law 3330 Schedule I Substances
states: "No prescription may be made or filled for
any controlled substance in schedule I nor may such
substance be possessed, distributed, dispensed or
administered except pursuant to Title III of this
Article."  Title III prohibits use of Schedule I
Substances for research, instructional activities and
chemical analysis relating to controlled substances
without having obtained a license and establishes the
provisions for obtaining the required license.

Thirty-six states, including Virginia, have
recognized marijuana's therapeutic potential and have
passed legislation supporting its medical use.  The
NYSNA Peer Assistance Committee agrees with the
intent and content of the resolution Legalizing
Marijuana for Medical Purposes.

Access to Therapeutic Cannabis</B></CENTER> 
<TT> 
<P><DD>Seriously ill individuals are suffering because of the prohibitory 
federal policies which list cannabis (marijuana) as a Schedule I drug of 
the Controlled Substances, which means it cannot be used by patients or 
prescribed by physicians. 
 
<P>Marijuana Prohibition 
 
<P><DD>The placement of drugs into the various Schedules is under the 
authority of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).&nbsp;  To be placed in the Schedule I category, a drug must meet all three of the following 
criteria: 1) it has no therapeutic value, 2) it is not safe for medical 
use, and 3) it has high abuse potential. 
 
<P><DD>After a twenty-year legal battle to get marijuana removed from the 
Schedule I category, the case finally came before Judge Francis Young, the chief administrative law judge for the DEA.&nbsp;  In 1988, he ruled that 
marijuana did not meet the first two criteria for placement in Schedule I 
and must be removed from that restricted category and made available for 
physicians to prescribe.&nbsp;  Unfortunately, the DEA chose not to abide by their judge's decision and marijuana remains in Schedule I. 
 
<P><DD>In the past, some patients have been able to receive medical 
cannabis/marijuana through the Investigational New Drug (IND) Program 
(administered by the Food and Drug Administration) when their physicians 
have submitted the required application papers.&nbsp;  However in February 
1992, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services closed the access 
to medical marijuana, dismissing hundreds of submitted applications, most 
of which were for AIDS patients.&nbsp;  As of March 1995, there are only 8 
legal marijuana patients still alive and receiving their medication through the IND program, but legal access for other Americans is no longer available. 
 
<P>Therapeutic Value 
 
<P><DD>Cannabis has been used medicinally throughout the world for 
centuries.&nbsp;  Cannabis contains more than 60 cannabinoids which are unique to the cannabis plant, one of which is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC), the main psychoactive cannabinoid.&nbsp;  However it appears to be the combination of various cannabinoids which seem to have the greater 
therapeutic value. 
 
<P><DD>As a medicine, cannabis has been found to be effective in a) 
reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma, thus preventing blindness, b) 
reducing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, c) stimulating 
the appetite for AIDS patients suffering from the wasting syndrome, d) 
controlling spasticity associated with spinal cord injuries and multiple 
sclerosis, e) increasing comfort for persons suffering from chronic pain, 
and f) controlling seizures for persons suffering from seizure disorders. 
 
<P><DD>While the mechanism of action is not completely understood, 
marijuana seems to work differently than many conventional medications, 
which offers a possible alternative when the conventional therapies are 
not effective. 
 
<P>Safety 
 
<P><DD>Regarding safety, cannabis is remarkably non-toxic.&nbsp;  It is virtually impossible to overdose with this drug in its natural state.&nbsp;  The estimated lethal dose is 20,000 to 40,000 times a normal dose.&nbsp;  Judge Francis Young, the DEA's administrative law judge, noted in his ruling that marijuana is "one of the safest therapeutically active substances 
known to man." 
 
<P><DD>The side effect of greatest concern is potential harm to the lungs 
caused by smoking.&nbsp;  However, this risk can be minimized in a number of ways.&nbsp;  All drugs pose potential risks, and when used medicinally the goal is to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks. 
 
<P>Potential for Abuse 
 
<P><DD>In regard to physical dependence from chronic, regular use, cannabis 
has relatively minor, if any, withdrawal symptoms.&nbsp;  Tolerance to natural marijuana develops slowly, if at all.&nbsp;  The effects of marijuana are generally more subtle than those of other drugs of abuse.&nbsp;  It is considered not strong enough by many addicts and rarely is their drug of choice. 
 
<P>Support for Therapeutic Cannabis 
 
<P><DD>Thirty five states, have recognized marijuana's therapeutic potential and have passed legislation supporting its value.&nbsp;  Therapeutic use of cannabis/marijuana is also supported by several organizations including the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, the American Medical Student Association, the California Medical Association, Mothers Against Misuse and Abuse (MAMA), the National Lymphoma Foundation, the National Association of Attorneys General, Patients Out of Time, Physicians for AIDS care, and the Virginia Nurses Association. 
 
<P>Patients Risks Due to the Prohibition 
 
<P><DD>Despite its illegal status, desperate patients and their families 
continue to break the law in order to obtain and use this medicine when 
conventional therapies are not effective or are too toxic.&nbsp;  This has 
placed patients at risk for obtaining contaminated cannabis and has placed patients and their families or significant others at risk for criminal charges.&nbsp;  Some patients may not disclose of their therapeutic cannabis use to their health care provider because of possible legal consequences and are subsequently not monitored to determine the benefits and risks. 
 
<P>Role of Addictions Nurses 
 
<P><DD>As Addictions nurses, members of the National Nurses Society on 
Addictions (NNSA) have an understanding of the negative health consequences that substance abuse and/or addiction can cause.&nbsp;  Substance abuse and addiction are not about "bad" drugs, but rather about "bad" or unhealthy relationships with drugs.&nbsp;  Persons can develop a substance abuse or addiction problem from any psychoactive drug, legal or illegal.&nbsp;  
Accordingly, our focus is on prevention of substance abuse and addiction 
as well as treatment for persons with such problems. 
 
<P><DD>Addictions nurses understand that no drug is completely safe and 
that any drug can be abused.&nbsp;  Prior to using any medication or drug, the patient should have an understanding of the expected benefits and 
associated risks so that he or she can make a responsible decision 
regarding its use. 
 
<P><DD>As nurses, we have an ethical obligation to advocate for optimal 
health care for all individuals.&nbsp;  Medicine which enhances the quality of life for persons suffering from life and sense-threatening illnesses 
should not be prohibited because some persons may develop a substance 
abuse and/or addiction problem to that medicine.&nbsp;  Cannabis does have 
therapeutic value and has a wide margin of safety, and therefore 
practitioners should have the right to prescribe cannabis to patients 
when the potential benefits surpass the health risks. 
 
<P>NNSA's Position on Access to Therapeutic Cannabis 
 
<P><DD>The National Nurses Society on Addictions urges the federal 
government to remove marijuana from the Schedule I category immediately, 
and make it available for physicians to prescribe. 
 
<P><DD>NNSA urges the American Nurses' Association and other health care 
professional organizations to support patient access to this medicine. 
 
<P><DD>NNSA supports ongoing human research to determine alternate methods 
of administration to minimize health risks. 
 
<P><DD>NNSA supports research regarding the various cannabinoids and 
combinations thereof, to determine the greatest therapeutic potential.

<CENTER><B>THERAPEUTIC USE OF CANNABIS (MARIJUANA)<BR>
Position Paper</B></CENTER>
<H3>Issue:</H3>
Seriously ill individuals are currently denied any legal access to cannabis (marijuana).  Health care professionals in Virginia are not legally able to provide patients with safe, well-informed help in obtaining needed medicine.<P>
<H3>Background:</H3>
Cannabis has a wide margin of safety for use under medical supervision and cannot cause lethal reactions.  Rationally considered, cannabis is far less toxic and far safer than many routinely prescribed and over-the-counter medicines currently used today.  Cannabis has been found to be effective in a) reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma, thus preventing blindness, b) reducing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, c) stimulating the appetite for persons living with AIDS and suffering from the wasting syndrome, d) controlling spasticity associated with spinal cord injuries and multiple sclerosis, e) easing the pain for many chronic pain sufferers, and f) controlling seizures associated with seizure disorders.<P>
The Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) Chief Administrative Law Judge ruled in 1988 that marijuana must be removed from the Schedule I category and made available for physicians to prescribe.  However, the DEA administrators have chosen not to remove marijuana from the Schedule I category.<P>
In the past, some patients have been able to receive medical marijuana through the Investigational New Drug Program (administered by the Food and Drug Administration) when their physicians have submitted the required application papers.  However, in February 1992, the US Secretary of Health and Human Services closed this access to medical marijuana, dismissing hundreds of submitted applications, most of which were for AIDS patients.  Only the 15 patients who were already receiving medical marijuana through this program were allowed to continue to receive their medicine and only eight are alive to date.<P><P>
Approved 3/95<P><P>
Thirty-six states, including Virginia, have recognized marijuana's therapeutic potential and have passed legislation supporting its value.  Therapeutic use is also supported by several organizations including: the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, the National Association of Attorneys
General, The American Medical Student Association, the California Medical Association, the Virginia Nurses Society on Addictions, Physicians for AIDS Care, and the National Lymphoma Foundation.<P>
Despite its illegal status, patients and their families continue to obtain and use this medicine when conventional therapies have not been effective or are too toxic.  This has placed patients at risk for obtaining contaminated marijuana and has placed patients and their families at risk for criminal charges.<P>
<H3>Virginia Nurses Association Position</H3>
Patients are often prescribed toxic and potentially addictive medicine with the understanding that the benefits will outweigh the risks.  As with many other medications and therapies, a practitioner should have the right to prescribe cannabis to his/her patient(s) when he/she determines potential
benefits surpass the possible health risks.<P>
Nurses must urge the federal government to recognize this as a medical emergency and allow access to cannabis as a medication.

<CENTER><H4>PATIENTS OUT OF TIME<BR>
OFFICIAL POLICY STATEMENT</H4></CENTER>
     The organization known as Patients Out of Time is a nonprofit licensee of the Commonwealth of Virginia that shall lobby and educate all disciplines of health care professionals; their specialty and professional organizations; and the public at large about medical cannabis (marijuana).<P>
     Prior to the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, marijuana was widely used by medical doctors in the United States for a variety of physical and emotional ailments.  The U.S. government began a litany of "reefer madness" propaganda and police actions that are with us today.  Coupled with the bureaucratic demands of the tax act, the practice of physicians prescribing cannabis for therapeutic purposes in such an environment became subject to great scrutiny and therefore unwise.  Cannabis' therapeutic value was no longer taught in medical schools, it vanished from the pharmacopeia of the U.S., it became outlawed.<P>
     Patients Out of Time shall focus it's power to reinstitute cannabis as a legitimate medicine for use within the United States.  Thirty-six states have recognized the therapeutic potential of cannabis and have passed legislation supporting it's medical use.  Cannabis, under modern research protocol, has been found to be effective in reducing intraocular pressure in 
glaucoma, reducing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, stimulating the appetite for persons living with AIDS and suffering from wasting syndrome, controlling spasticity associated with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis, reduction in the intensity of chronic pain, and controlling seizures associated with seizure disorders.<P>
     Patients Out of Time has no other interest, nor does the organization have any opinion, stated or unstated, about any issue other than therapeutic cannabis.  All lobbying, educating, communication, or any other endeavor of Patients Out of Time shall be limited to the sole subject - Marijuana as Medicine!<P><P>
1/95<P><P>
**Patients Out of Time has an electronic bulletin board system which will serve as a centralized warehouse for information relating to therapeutic cannabis.  This bulletin board contains research data, historical records, legal cases, legislation, and position papers by organizations supporting legal access to this medicine.  It can be reached by modem at (804) 263-8237.  The internet e-mail address is: <A HREF="mailto:Mary_Lynn@patient.win.net">Mary_Lynn@patient.win.net</A>

<CENTER><B>Legalizing Marijuana for Medical Purposes</B><BR>
Submitted by: Council of District Residents, Ethics Committee,<BR>
and Committee on Preserving the Rights of HIV Infected Persons</CENTER>
<PRE>
Whereas     Marijuana is a Schedule I drug, which means that it cannot
            be legally used as a medicine by patients or prescribed by
            physicians; and

Whereas     Schedule I drugs must meet all of the following criteria: 1)
            have no therapeutic value, 2) are not safe for medical use, 
            and 3) have a high abuse potential; and

Whereas     Virginia nurses have an understanding a) of the negative
            health consequences that substance abuse and/or addiction
            can cause, b) that substance abuse and addiction are not
            about "bad" drugs, but rather about the unhealthy use of
            drugs, and c) that persons can develop a substance abuse or
            addiction problem from any psychoactive drugs, legal or
            illegal; and

Whereas     Marijuana has been found to be effective in a) reducing 
            intraocular pressure in glaucoma, b) reducing nausea and
            vomiting associated with chemotherapy, c) stimulating the
            appetite for persons living with AIDS and suffering from
            wasting syndrome, d) controlling spasticity associated with
            spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis, and e) 
            controlling seizures associated with seizure disorders; and

Whereas     Marijuana has a wide margin of safety for use under medical
            supervision and cannot cause lethal reactions; and

Whereas     Thirty-six states, including Virginia, have recognized
            marijuana's therapeutic potential and have passed
            legislation supporting its medicinal use; and

Whereas     The Drug Enforcement Agency's (DEA) own Administrative Law
            Judge ruled in 1988 that marijuana must be removed from the
            Schedule I category and made available for physicians to
            prescribe; and

Whereas     Desperate patients and their families have chosen to break
            the law in order to obtain this medicine when conventional
            medicines have not been effective or are too toxic.  This
            places these patients at risk for criminal charges and at
            risk for obtaining contaminated medicines because of the lack
            of quality control; and

Whereas     Nurses have an ethical obligation to be advocates for health
            care for all individuals.  Medicines which enhance the
            quality of life for persons suffering from life threatening
            or debilitating illness; therefore, be it

Resolved    That the Virginia Nurses Association support all reasonable
            efforts to end federal policies which prohibit or
            unnecessarily restrict marijuana's legal availability for
            legitimate medical uses; and be it

Resolved    That the Virginia Nurses Association provide education to the
            nurses of Virginia on the therapeutic use of marijuana and
            the federal prohibition of its use; and be it

Resolved    That the Virginia Nurses Association ecourage other health
            care provider organizations to support medical access to
            marijuana; and be it

Resolved    That the Virginia Nurses Association submit a resolution to
            the American Nurses Association House of Delegates in 1995
            that the American Nurses Association educate American nurses
            about the therapeutic use of marijuana and the federal
            prohibition of its use; and be it

Resolved    That the Virginia Nurses Association submit a resolution to
            the American Nurses Association House of Delegates in 1995
            that the American Nurses Association support a change in
            federal policy to permit medical access to marijuana for
            therapeutic purposes.

<H3>The Medicinal Use of Marijuana</H3>
Mary Lynn Mathre, MSN RN CARN<P>
   Some addictions nurses have thought of marijuana only as a drug associated with abuse and/or addiction.  However, the drug has been documented as having medicinal value.  This article examines the medicinal value of marijuana and the history of efforts to prohibit marijuana's use.<P>
<B>The therapeutic value of marijuana</B><P>
   The therapeutic properties of marijuana come from the  numerous chemicals found in the leaves, buds, and resin of the cannabis plant.  The cannabis plant, commonly called hemp, is also well known for the value of its fiber and pulp from the stalk as well as the highly nutritional seed oil.<P>
   The history of marijuana's medicinal use was traced by Mikuriya (1973).  The earliest records of medicinal marijuana use have been traced back to China in 2737 BC, and evidence of its therapeutic use can be found throughout world cultures.  It was used in colonial America and listed in the <I>U.S. Pharmacopoeia</I>, as tincture of cannabis, until 1941.  In the 19th century, William B. O'Shaughnessy, MD, studied marijuana and concluded that it was safe and effective in the treatment of various maladies.  The first extensive U.S. study, conducted by the Ohio State Medical Society in 1860, had similar conclusions.<P>
   More recently, in 1980, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences, at the request of the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services and the director of the National Institutes of Health, agreed to conduct a review and analysis of health-related effects of marijuana.  IOM's findings recognized marijuana's therapeutic potential in decreasing the intraocular pressure for glaucoma patients, controlling the severe nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, acting as an anticonvulsant, relaxing muscles and thus counteracting spasticity problems, and other uses.  The IOM investigators highly recommended further research to determine the full therapeutic potential of this drug.  This study also noted that marijuana seems to work differently than other conventional medicines (Institute of Medicine, 1982).  The government's response was to print only 300 copies of this
study -- not even enough for each member of Congress.<P>
   <B>Safety:</B> Numerous studies have been conducted to determine marijuana's toxic level: they have concluded that it would take 20,000 to 40,000 times the normal dose to induce death (Institute of Medicine, 1982: Randall, 1988).  Another way of stating this would be that a person would have to ingest (or inhale) 1,500 pounds in 15 minutes.  After studying all the evidence, the judge in <I>DPF v. DEA</I> #92-1179 and <I>ACT v. DEA</I> #92-1168 found marijuana to be "one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man" (Randall, 1989, p. 440).  He continued.  "One must reasonably conclude that there is accepted safety for use of marijuana under medical supervision.  To conclude otherwise, on the record, would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious" (Randall, 1989, p. 444).<P>
   <B>Addictive potential:</B> In regard to physical dependence from chronic use, marijuana has relatively minor, if any, withdrawal symptoms.  Tolerance to natural marijuana develops slowly, if at all.  The effects of marijuana are generally more subtle than those of other substances of abuse, such as crack cocaine: often it is considered not strong enough by
many addicts and rarely is their drug of choice.<P>
   A knowledge of addiction provides the nurse with the understanding that it is not the drug that makes the addict, but rather the negative relationship a person has with a particular drug or drugs.  People can become addicted to marijuana just as they can to any other psychoactive drug.  Treatment for their addiction should be available to these people.  However, the fact remains that marijuana, like many other psychoactive drugs, does have medical value: the fact that some people may have an addiction problem should not prevent others from benefiting from its therapeutic potential.  Studies have found opioids to be effective pain management agents, with an addiction rate of less that 1% in hospitalized patients treated for their pain, (McCaffery & Vourakis, 1992).<P>
<B>The prohibition efforts</B><P>
   Under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, marijuana is a Schedule I controlled drug.  This status prohibits its use by anyone and prohibits physicians from prescribing it for patients.  Until February 1992, there was a little-known loophole that allowed a handful of patients legal access to this medicine: the Investigational New Drug (IND) Program administered by the Food and Drug Administration.  Unfortunately, in February 1992, U.S. Secretary of Health & Human Services Louis Sullivan, MD, closed this access to all new applicants, as well as to more than 30 patients who had been approved for having access to this medicine but had not yet received their supply.  Only 10 patients who had been approved and already were receiving their medicine have been allowed continued legal access to this drug.<P>
   Various theories attempt to rationalize the government's prohibition of this drug/plant:  As an efficient fuel, it presented competition to the oil industry.  As a durable natural fiber, it presented competition to the synthetic fiber industry; in fact, Levi's jeans originally were made of hemp.  "Reefer madness" hysteria was created in the 1930s by Harry Anslinger of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, which eventually evolved into the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).  Use of the Mexican name of the cannabis plant, <I>marijuana</I>, was popularized by the Hearst newspaper chain to scare the public into believing that there was a new and dangerous drug being introduced to American youth by black musicians and Mexicans.  The act of bigotry insinuated that the use of this drug would lead to insanity or acts of violence such as rape or murder.  The result of this media blitz was the passage of the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, which marked the beginning of marijuana's prohibition (Herer, 1991).<P>
   The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 completed the prohibition efforts.  This act provided five levels of control for psychoactive drugs, with Schedule I drugs under the most restrictions and Schedule V drugs under the fewest restrictions.  To be placed in Schedule I, a drug had to meet three criteria: (a) it had to have no therapeutic value, (b) it had to be deemed unsafe for use under a physician's care, and (c) it had to be highly addictive.  The DEA was given authority to place drugs in the "appropriate" schedules.  the DEA placed marijuana in the Schedule I category, which resulted in the complete prohibition of the growth and use of this plant -- an act that could be seen as politically and medically generated.  Marijuana does not appear to meet the criteria for Schedule I.<P>
<B>Responding to prohibition:</B> The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) was founded in 1970 in response to the harsh penalties, including lifetime prison sentences, instituted by a variety of state and federal laws for the possession of marijuana.  While NORML's primary focus was to change the legal status of marijuana for all users, the organization also began legal action to allow patients access to its medical use.  This legal action has continued for more than 20 years with the assistance of the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT) and the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF).  Finally, the lawsuit was brought before the DEA's own chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, with the motion to remove marijuana from the Schedule I category and make it available by prescription.  Only two criteria needed to be challenged: (a) that marijuana had medicinal value and (b) that marijuana was safe for therapeutic use.  In 1988, after reviewing more than 5,000 pages of evidence, Young ruled that marijuana did meet both criteria, and therefore it must be removed from Schedule I (Randall, 1988, 1989).  However, in 1989, DEA Director John Lawn refused to abide by Young's decision and marijuana was kept in Schedule I.  More recently, the Physicians' Association for AIDS Care and National Lymphoma Foundation have joined this lawsuit to continue the fight (<I>DPF v. DEA</I> #92-1179 and <I>ACT v. DEA</I> #92-1168).<P>
<B>A political and legal issue or a health issue?</B><P>
   Since the passage of the Controlled Substances Act, 35 states have fought the prohibition of marijuana and have passed legislation recognizing marijuana's therapeutic value (Randall & O'Leary, 1993).  In 1991, the city of San Francisco, ravaged by the AIDS epidemic, passed a resolution recognizing marijuana's medicinal value; by 1992, the California Medical Association recognized marijuana's medicinal value and made plans to take its resolution to the American Medical Association to press for a similar national policy.  These state and local acts, although will intended, are useless, as the federal prohibition overrides them.<P>
   Despite the prohibition of the natural marijuana plant, pharmaceutical companies were allowed to develop a marijuana pill that is composed of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive chemical in the plant.  There are other cannabinoids in this plant that have their own therapeutic action and/or influence the action of others.  A plant that can be easily grown and consumed as medicine is Schedule I, while a pill of the main psychoactive chemical contained in that plant can be developed by a pharmaceutical company and sold for profit as a Schedule I drug.  Also important to note is that it appears the pharmaceutical industry pressured the government to prohibit university research of marijuana.<P>
<B>The role of addictions nurses<BR>
in the medicinal use of marijuana</B><P>
   Addictions nurses understand that no drug is completely safe and that any drug can be abused.  Prior to using any medication or drug, the patient should have an understanding of its expected benefits and associated risks so that he or she can make a responsible decision regarding its use.<P>
   Nurses are patient advocates.  Addictions nurses advocate treatment for addicted people.  Addictions nurses also advocate medicinal treatment of life- and sense-threatening illnesses if the medicine improves the quality of life for a patient.  Nurses, as healthcare professionals, must honestly and rationally examine this issue, rather than respond to scare tactics and moral judgments about "illegal drug users."<P>
   As addictions nurses, we are expected to base our knowledge of drugs of abuse and the disease of addiction on scientific evidence and clinical experience.  Advocating legal access to marijuana for patients whose quality of life can be improved through the use of this drug is a moral and ethical obligation we owe the general public, if we are truly serving as patient advocates.<P>

                        ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. 


                                     1. 

                                INTRODUCTION 


     This is a rulemaking pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 
U.S.C. &#167; 551, et seq., to determine whether the marijuana plant (Cannabis 
sativa L) considered as a whole may lawfully be transferred from Schedule  
I to Schedule II of the schedules established by the Controlled  
Substances Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. &#167; 801, et seq.  None of the parties  
is seeking to &quot;legalize&quot; marijuana generally or for recreational  
purposes.  Placement in Schedule II would mean, essentially, that  
physicians in the United States would not violate Federal law by  
prescribing marijuana for their patients for legitimate therapeutic  
purposes.  It is contrary to Federal law for physicians to do this as  
long as marijuana remains in Schedule I.  This proceeding had its origins  
on May 18, 1972 when the National Organization for the Reform of  
Marijuana Laws (NORML) and two other groups submitted a petition to the  
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) [footnote 1], predecessor 
______________________ 
1    The powers and authority granted by the Act to the Attorney General 
     were delegated to the Director of BNDD and subsequently to the 
     Administrator of DEA.  28 C.F.R. &#167; 0.100, et seq.

agency to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA or the Agency), asking 
that marijuana be removed from Schedule I and freed of all controls 
entirely, or be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule V where it would  
be subject to only minimal controls.  The Act by its terms had placed 
marijuana in Schedule I thereby declaring, as a matter of law that it had 
no legitimate use in therapy in the United States and subjecting the 
substance to the strictest level of controls.  The Act had been in effect 
for just over one year when NORML submitted its 1972 petition. 

     On September 1, 1972 the Director of BNDD announced his refusal to 
accept the petition for filing, stating that he was not authorized to 
institute proceedings for the action requested because of the provisions  
of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961.  NORML appealed this  
action to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
Circuit.  The court held that the Director had erred in rejecting the  
petition without &quot;a reflective consideration and analysis,&quot; observing  
that the Director's refusal &quot;was not the kind of agency action that  
promoted the kind of interchange and refinement of views that is the  
lifeblood of a sound administrative process.&quot;  NORML v. Ingersoll, 162  
U.S. App. D.C. 67, 497 F.2d 654, 659 (1974).  The court remanded the  
matter in January 1974 for further proceedings not inconsistent with its  
opinion, &quot;to be denominated a consideration on the merits.&quot;  Id. 

     A three-day hearing was held at DEA [footnote 2] by Administrative  
Law Judge Lewis Parker in January 1975.  The judge found in NORML's favor  
on several issues but the Acting Administrator of DEA entered a final  
order denying NORML's petition &quot;in all respects.&quot;  NORML again petitioned  
the court for review.  Finding fault

     out pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, eff. July 1,

with DEA's final order the court again remanded for further proceedings  
not inconsistent with its opinion.  NORML v. DEA, 182 U.S. App. D.C. 114,  
559 F.2d 735 (1977).  The Court directed the then-Acting Administrator of  
DEA to refer NORML's petition to the Secretary of the Department of  
Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) for findings and, thereafter, to  
comply with the rulemaking procedures outlined in the Act at 21 U.S.C. &#167;  
811 (a) and (b). 

     On remand the Administrator of DEA referred NORML's petition to HEW 
for scientific and medical evaluation.  On June 4, 1979 the Secretary of 
HEW advised the Administrator of the results of the HEW evaluation and 
recommended that marijuana remain in Schedule I.  Without holding any 
further hearing the Administrator of DEA proceeded to issue a final order 
ten days later denying NORML's petition and declining to initiate 
proceedings to transfer marijuana from Schedule I.  44 Fed. Reg. 36123 
(1979).  NORML went back to the Court of Appeals. 

     When the case was called for oral argument there was discussion of  
the then-present status of the matter.  DEA had moved for a partial  
remand.  The court found that &quot;reconsideration of all the issues in this  
case would be appropriate&quot; and again remanded it to DEA, observing: &quot;We  
regrettably find it necessary to remind respondents [DEA and HEW] of an  
agency's obligation on remand not to 'do anything which is contrary to  
either the letter or spirit of the mandate construed in the light of the  
opinion of [the] court deciding the case.'&quot;  (Citations omitted.)  NORML

tific and medical findings and recommendations on scheduling.  DEA did so 
and HHS has responded.  In a letter dated April 1, 1986 the then-Acting 
Deputy Administrator of DEA requested this administrative law judge to 
commence hearing procedures as to the proposed rescheduling of marijuana 
and its components. 

     After the Judge conferred with counsel for NORML and DEA, a notice  
was published in the Federal Register on June 24, 1986 announcing that  
hearings would be held on NORML's petition for the rescheduling of  
marijuana and its components commencing on August 21, 1986 and giving any  
interested person who desired to participate the opportunity to do so.   
51 Fed. Reg. 22946 (1986). 

     Of the three original petitioning organizations in 1972 only NORML  
is a party to the present proceeding.  In addition the following entities 
responded to the Federal Register notice and have become parties, 
participating to varying degrees:  the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics 
(ACT), Cannabis Corporation of America (CCA) and Carl Eric Olsen, all 
seeking transfer of marijuana to Schedule II; the Agency, National 
Federation of Parents for Drug free Youth (NFP) and the International 
Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), all contending that marijuana 
should remain in Schedule I. 

     Preliminary prehearing sessions were held on August 21 and December  
5, 1986 and on February 20, 1987. [footnote 3]  During the preliminary  
stages, on January 20, 1987, NORML filed an amended petition for  
rescheduling.  This new petition abandoned NORML's previous requests for  
the complete descheduling of marijuana or rescheduling to Schedule V.  It  
asks only that marijuana be placed in Schedule II. 

     At a prehearing conference on February 20, 1987 this amended  
petition was

          lawfully be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of the 
          schedules established by the Controlled Substances Act. 

     Two subsidiary issues were agreed on, as follows: 

          1.  Whether the marijuana plant has a currently accepted 
              medical use in treatment in the United States, or a 
              currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions. 

          2.  Whether there is a lack of accepted safety for use of 
              the marijuana plant under medical supervision. 

As stated above, the parties favoring transfer from Schedule I to 
Schedule II are NORML, ACT, CCA and Carl Eric Olsen.  Those favoring 
retaining marijuana in Schedule I are the Agency, NFP and IACP. 

     During the Spring and Summer of 1987 the parties identified their 
witnesses and put the direct examination testimony of each witness in 
writing in affidavit form.  Copies of these affidavits were exchanged. 
Similarly, the parties assembled their proposed exhibits and exchanged 
copies.  Opportunity was provided for each party to submit objections to 
the direct examination testimony and exhibits proffered by the others.   
The objections submitted were considered by the administrative law judge  
and ruled on.  The testimony and exhibits not excluded were admitted into  
the record.  Thereafter hearing sessions were held at which witnesses  
were subjected to cross-examination.  These sessions were held in New  
Orleans, Louisiana on November 18 and 19, 1987; in San Francisco,  
California on December 8 and 9, 1987; and in Washington, D.C. on January  
5 through 8 and 26 through 29, and on February 2, 4 and 5, 1988.  The  
parties have submitted proposed findings and conclusions and briefs.   
Oral arguments were heard by the judge on June 10, 1988 in Washington.

     It is recommended that the proposed findings and conclusions  
submitted by the parties to the administrative law judge be rejected by  
the Administrator except to the extent they are included in those  
hereinafter set forth; for the reason that they are irrelevant or unduly

     As noted above, the agreed issues are as follows: 

          Principle issue: 

          Whether the marijuana plant, considered as a whole, may 
          lawfully be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of 
          the schedules established by the Controlled Substances Act. 

          Subsidiary issues: 

          1.  Whether the marijuana plant has a currently accepted 
              medical use in treatment in the United States, or a 
              currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions. 

          2.  Whether there is a lack of accepted safety for use of 
              the marijuana plant under medical supervision.

                  STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHEDULING 

     The Act provides (21 U.S.C. &#167; 812(b)) that a drug or other substance 
may not be placed in any schedule unless certain specified findings are 
made with respect to it.  The findings required for Schedule I and  
Schedule II are as follows: 

          Schedule I. - 

            (A)  The drug or other substance has a high potential 
          for abuse. 

            (B)  The drug or other substance has no currently accepted 
          medical use in treatment in the United States. 

            (C)  There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the 
          drug or other substance under medical supervision. 

          Schedule II. - 

            (A)  The drug or other substance has a high potential for 
          abuse. 

            (B)  The drug or other substance has a currently accepted 
          medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently 
          accepted medical use with severe restrictions. 

            (C)  Abuse of the drug or other substances [sic] may lead to 
          severe psychological or physical dependence. 

     As noted above the parties have stipulated, for the purpose of this 
proceeding, that marijuana has a high potential for abuse and that abuse  
of it may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.  Thus the 
dispute between the two sides in this proceeding is narrowed to whether  
or not marijuana has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the 
United States, and whether or not there is a lack of accepted safety for 
use of marijuana under medical supervision. 

     The issues as framed here contemplate marijuana's being placed only

other three schedules established by the Act are irrelevant to this

                    ACCEPTED MEDICAL USE IN TREATMENT 

                              - CHEMOTHERAPY 

     With respect to whether or not marijuana has a &quot;currently accepted 
medical use in treatment in the United States&quot; for chemotherapy patients, 
the record shows the following facts to be uncontroverted. 


Findings Of Fact 

          1.  One of the most serious problems experienced by cancer 
patients undergoing chemotherapy for their cancer is severe nausea and 
vomiting caused by their reaction to the toxic (poisonous) chemicals 
administered to them in the course of this treatment.  This nausea and 
vomiting at times becomes life threatening.  The therapy itself creates a 
tremendous strain on the body.  Some patients cannot tolerate the severe 
nausea and vomiting and discontinue treatment.  Beginning in the 1970's 
there was considerable doctor-to-doctor communication in the United  
States concerning patients known by their doctors to be surreptitiously  
using marijuana with notable success to overcome or lessen their nausea  
and vomiting. 

          2.  Young patients generally achieve better control over nausea 
and vomiting from smoking marijuana than do older patients, particularly 
when the older patient has not been provided with detailed information on 
how to smoke marijuana. 

          3.  Marijuana cigarettes in many cases are superior to  
synthetic THC capsules in reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and  
vomiting.  Marijuana 

                                  - 10 - 
</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>
cigarettes have an important, clear advantage over synthetic THC capsules 
in that the natural marijuana is inhaled and generally takes effect more 
quickly than the synthetic capsule which is ingested and must be  
processed through the digestive system before it takes effect. 

          4.  Attempting to orally administer the synthetic THC capsule  
to a vomiting patient presents obvious problems - it is vomited right  
back up before it can have any effect. 

          5.  Many physicians, some engaged in medical practice and some 
teaching in medical schools, have accepted smoking marijuana as effective 
in controlling or reducing the severe nausea and vomiting (emesis) 
experienced by some cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. 

          6.  Such physicians include board-certified internists, 
oncologists and psychiatrists.  (Oncology is the treatment of cancer 
through the use of highly toxic chemicals, or chemotherapy.) 

          7.  Doctors who have come to accept the usefulness of marijuana 
in controlling or reducing emesis resulting from chemotherapy have dose  
so as the result of reading reports of studies and anecdotal reports in  
their professional literature, and as the result of observing patients  
and listening to reports directly from patients. 

          8.  Some cancer patients who have acknowledged to doctors that 
they smoke marijuana for emesis control have indicated in their  
discussions that, although they may have first smoked marijuana  
recreationally, they accidentally found that doing so helped reduce the  
emesis resulting from their chemotherapy.  They consistently indicated  
that they felt better and got symptomatic relief from the intense nausea  
and vomiting caused by the chemotherapy.  These patients  

                                  - 11 - 
</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>
were no longer simply getting high, but were engaged in medically  
treating their illness, albeit with an illegal substance.  Other  
chemotherapy patients began smoking marijuana to control their emesis  
only after hearing reports that the practice had proven helpful to  
others.  Such patients had not smoked marijuana recreationally. 

          9.  This successful use of marijuana has given many cancer 
chemotherapy patients a much more positive outlook on their overall 
treatment, once they were relieved of the debilitating, exhausting and 
extremely unpleasant nausea and vomiting previously resulting from their 
chemotherapy treatment. 

         10.  In about December 1977 the previously underground patient 
practice of using marijuana to control emesis burst into the public media 
in New Mexico when a young cancer patient, Lynn Pearson, began publicly  
to discuss his use of marijuana.  Mr. Pearson besought the New Mexico 
legislature to pass legislation making marijuana available legally to 
seriously ill patients whom it might help.  As a result, professionals in 
the public health sector in New Mexico more closely examined how  
marijuana might be made legally available to assist in meeting what now  
openly appeared to be a widely recognized patient need. 

         11.  In many cases doctors have found that, in addition to 
suppressing nausea and vomiting, smoking marijuana is a highly successful 
appetite stimulant.  The importance of appetite stimulation in cancer 
therapy cannot be overstated.  Patients receiving chemotherapy often lose 
tremendous amounts of weight.  They endanger their lives because they  
lose interest in food and in eating.  The resulting sharp reduction in  
weight may well affect their prognosis.  Marijuana smoking induces some  
patients to eat.  The benefits are obvious, doctors have found.  There is  
no significant loss of weight.  Some patients will gain weight. 

                                  - 12 -

<PRE>
This allows them to retain strength and makes them better able to fight  
the cancer.  Psychologically, patients who can continue to eat even while 
receiving chemotherapy maintain a balanced outlook and are better able to 
cope with their disease and its treatment, doctors have found. 

         12.  Synthetic anti-emetic agents have been in existence and 
utilized for a number of years.  Since about 1980 some new synthetic  
agents have been developed which appear to be more effective in  
controlling and reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting than  
were some of those available in the 1970's.  But marijuana still is found  
more effective for this purpose in some people than any of the synthetic  
agents, even the newer ones. 

         13.  By the late 1970's in the Washington, D.C. area there was a 
growing recognition among health care professionals and the public that 
marijuana had therapeutic value in reducing the adverse effects of some 
chemotherapy treatments.  With this increasing public awareness came 
increasing pressure from patients on doctors for information about 
marijuana and its therapeutic uses.  Many patients moved into forms of 
unsupervised self-treatment.  While such self-treatment often proved very 
effective, it has certain hazards, ranging from arrest for purchase or  
use of an illegal drug to possibly serious medical complications from 
contaminated sources or adulterated materials.  Yet, some patients are 
willing to run these risks to obtain relief from the debilitating nausea 
and vomiting caused by their chemotherapy treatments. 

         14.  Every oncologist known to one Washington, D.C. practicing 
internist and board-certified oncologist has had patients who used 
marijuana with great success to prevent or diminish chemotherapy-induced 
nausea and vomiting.  Chemotherapy patients reporting directly to that 
Washington doctor that they 

                                  - 13 - 
</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>
have smoked marijuana medicinally vomit less and eat better than patients 
who do not smoke it.  By gaining control over their severe nausea and 
vomiting these patients undergo a change of mood and have a better mental 
outlook than patients who, using the standard anti-emetic drugs, are  
unable to gain such control. 

         15.  The vomiting induced by chemotherapeutic drugs may last up  
to four days following the chemotherapy treatment.  The vomiting can be 
intense, protracted and, in some instances, is unendurable.  The nausea 
which follows such vomiting is also deep and prolonged.  Nausea may  
prevent a patient from taking regular food or even much water for periods  
of weeks at a time. 

         16.  Nausea and vomiting of this severity degrades the quality  
of life for these patients, weakening them physically, and destroying the  
will to fight the cancer.  A desire to end the chemotherapy treatment in  
order to escape the emesis can supersede the will to live.  Thus the  
emesis, itself, can truly be considered a life-threatening consequence of  
many cancer treatments.  Doctors have known such cases to occur.  Doctors  
have known other cases where marijuana smoking has enabled the patient to 
endure, and thus continue, chemotherapy treatments with the result that  
the cancer has gone into remission and the patient has returned to a  
full, active satisfying life. 

         17.  In San Francisco chemotherapy patients were surreptitiously 
using marijuana to control emesis by the early 1970's.  By 1976 virtually 
every young cancer patient receiving chemotherapy at the University of 
California in San Francisco was using marijuana to control emesis with 
great success.  The use of marijuana for this purpose had become  
generally accepted by the patients and increasingly by their physicians  
as a valid and effective form of treatment.  This was particularly true  
for younger cancer patients, somewhat less common for 

                                  - 14 - 
</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>
older ones.  By 1979 about 25% to 30% of the patients seen by one San 
Francisco oncologist were using marijuana to control emesis, about 45 to 
50 patients per year.  Such percentages and numbers vary from city to  
city.  A doctor in Kansas City who sees about 150 to 200 new cancer  
patients per year found that over the 15 years 1972 to 1987 about 5% of  
the patients he saw, or a total of about 75, used marijuana medicinally. 

         18.  By 1987 marijuana no longer generated the intense interest  
in the world of oncology that it had previously, but it remains a viable  
tool, commonly employed, in the medical treatment of chemotherapy  
patients.  There has evolved an unwritten but accepted standard of  
treatment within the community of oncologists in the San Francisco,  
California area which readily accepts the use of marijuana. 

         19.  As of the Spring of 1987 in the San Francisco area,  
patients receiving chemotherapy commonly smoked marijuana in hospitals  
during their treatments.  This in-hospital use, which takes place in  
rooms behind closed doors, does not bother staff, is expected by  
physicians and welcomed by nurses who, instead of having to run back and  
forth with containers of vomit, can treat patients whose emesis is better  
controlled than it would be without marijuana.  Medical institutions in  
the Bay area where use of marijuana obtained on the streets is quite  
common, although discrete, include the University of California at San  
Francisco Hospital, the Mount Zion Hospital and the Franklin Hospital.   
In effect, marijuana is readily accepted throughout the oncologic  
community in the bay area for its benefits in connection with  
chemotherapy.  The same situation exists in other large metropolitan  
areas of the United States. 

         20.  About 50% of the patients seen by one San Francisco 
oncologist

during the year l987 were smoking marijuana medicinally. This is about 
90 to 95 individuals. This number is higher than during the previous 
ten years due to the nature of this physician's practice which includes 
patients from the &quot;tenderloin&quot; area of San Francisco, many of whom are 
suffering from AIDS-related lymphosarcoma. These patients smoke marijuana 
to control their nausea and vomiting, not to &quot;get high.&quot; They self- 
titrate, i.e., smoke the marijuana only as long as needed to overcome 
the nausea, to prevent vomiting. 

         21.  The State of New Mexico set up a program in 1978 to make  
marijuana available to cancer patients pursuant to an act of the State  
legislature.  The legislature had accepted marijuana as having medical  
use in treatment.  It overwhelmingly passed this legislation so as to  
make marijuana available for use in therapy, not just for research.   
Marijuana and synthetic THC were given to patients, administered under  
medical supervision, to control or reduce emesis.  The marijuana was in  
the form of cigarettes obtained from the Federal government.  The program  
operated from 1979 until 1986, when funding for it was terminated by the  
State.  During those seven years about 250 cancer patients in New Mexico  
received either marijuana cigarettes or THC.  Twenty or 25 physicians in  
New Mexico sought and obtained marijuana cigarettes or THC for their  
cancer patients during that period.  All of the oncologists in New Mexico  
accepted marijuana as effective for some of their patients.  At least ten  
hospitals involved in this program in New Mexico, in which cancer  
patients smoked their marijuana cigarettes.  The hospitals accepted this  
medicinal marijuana smoking by patients.  Voluminous reports filed by the  
participating physicians make it clear that marijuana is a highly  
effective anti-emetic substance.  It was found in the New Mexico program  
to be far superior to the best available conventional 

                                  - 16 -

<PRE>
anti-emetic drug, compazine, and clearly superior to synthetic THC pills.   
More than 90% of the patients who received marijuana within the New  
Mexico program reported significant or total relief from nausea and  
vomiting.  Before the program began cancer patients were surreptitiously  
smoking marijuana in New Mexico to lessen or control their emesis  
resulting from chemotherapy treatments.  They reported to physicians that  
it was successful for this purpose.  Physicians were aware that this was  
going on. 

         22.  In 1978 the Louisiana legislature became one of the first- 
State legislatures in the nation to recognize the efficacy of marijuana  
in controlling emesis by enacting legislation intended to make marijuana 
available by prescription for therapeutic use by chemotherapy patients.   
This enactment shows that there was widespread acceptance in Louisiana 
of the therapeutic value of marijuana.  After a State Marijuana  
Prescription Review Board was established, pursuant to that legislation,  
it became apparent that, because of Federal restrictions, marijuana could  
be obtained legally only for use in cumbersome, formal research programs.   
Eventually a research program was entered into by the State, utilizing 
synthetic THC, but without much enthusiasm, since most professionals who 
had wanted to use marijuana clinically, to treat patients, had neither 
the time, resources nor inclination to get involved in this limited, 
formal study.  The original purpose of the Louisiana legislation was 
frustrated by the Federal authorities.  Some patients, who had hoped to  
obtain marijuana for medical use legally after enactment of the State 
legislation, went outside the law and obtained it illicitly.  Some  
physicians in Louisiana accept marijuana as having a distinct medical  
value in the treatment of the nausea and vomiting associated with certain 
types of chemotherapy treatments.

         23.  In 1980 the State of Georgia enacted legislation  
authorizing a therapeutic research program for the evaluation of  
marijuana as a medically recognized therapeutic substance.  Its enactment  
was supported by letters from a number of Georgia oncologist and other  
Georgia physician, including the Chief of oncology at Grady Hospital and  
staff oncologist at Emory University Medical Clinic.  Sponsors of the  
legislation originally intended the enactment of a law making marijuana  
available for clinical, therapeutic use by patients.  The bill was  
referred to as the &quot;Marijuana-as-Medicine&quot; bill.  The final legislation  
was crafted, however, of necessity, merely to set up a research program  
in order to obtain marijuana from the one legitimate source available -  
the Federal Government, which would not make the substance available for  
any other purpose other than conducting a research program.  The act was  
passed by an overwhelming majority in the lower house of the legislature  
and unanimously in the Senate.  In January 1983 an evaluation of the  
program, which by then had 44 evaluable marijuana smoking patient- 
participants, accepted marijuana smoking as being an effective anti- 
emetic agent. 

         24.  In Boston, Massachusetts in 1977 a nurse in a hospital  
suggested to a chemotherapy patient, suffering greatly from the therapy  
and at the point of refusing further treatment, that smoking marijuana  
might help relieve his nausea and vomiting.  The patient's doctor, when  
asked about it later, stated that many of his younger patients were  
smoking marijuana.  Those who did so seemed to have less trouble with  
nausea and vomiting.  The patient in question obtained some marijuana and  
smoked it, in the hospital, immediately before his next chemotherapy  
treatment.  Doctors, nurses, and orderlies coming into the room as he  
finished smoking realized what the patient had been doing.  None of them 

                                  - 18 -

<PRE>
made any comment.  The marijuana was completely successful with this  
patient, who accepted it as effective in controlling his nausea and  
vomiting.  Instead of being sick for weeks following chemotherapy, and  
having trouble going to work, as had been the case, the patient was ready  
to return to work 48 hours after that chemotherapy treatment.  The  
patient thereafter always smoked marijuana, in the hospital, before 
chemotherapy.  The doctors were aware of it, openly approved of it and  
encouraged him to continue.  The patient resumed eating regular meals and  
regained lost eight, his mood improved markedly, he became more active  
and outgoing and began doing things together with his wife that he had  
not done since beginning chemotherapy. 

         25.  During the remaining two years of this patient's life,  
before his cancer ended it, he came to know other cancer patients who  
were smoking marijuana to relieve the adverse effects of their  
chemotherapy.  Most of these patients had learned about using marijuana  
medically from their doctors who, having accepted its effectiveness,  
subtly encouraged them to use it. 

         26.  A Boston psychiatrist and professor, who travels about the  
country, has found a minor conspiracy to break the law among oncologists  
and nurses in every oncology center he has visited to let patients smoke  
marijuana before and during cancer chemotherapy.  He has talked with  
dozens of these health care oncologists who encourage their patients to  
do this and who regard this as an accepted medical usage of marijuana.   
He has known nurses who have obtained marijuana for patients unable to  
obtain it for themselves. 

         27.  A cancer patient residing in Beaverton, Michigan smoked  
marijuana medicinally in the nearby hospital where he was undergoing  
chemotherapy from early 1979 until he died of his cancer in October of  
that year.  He smoked it in 

                                  - 19 -

<PRE>
his hospital room after his parents made arrangements with the hospital 
for him to do so.  Smoking marijuana controlled his post-chemotherapy  
nausea and vomiting, enabled him to eat regular-meals again with his  
family, and he became outgoing and talkative.  His parents accepted his  
marijuana smoking as effective and helpful.  Two clergymen, among others,  
brought marijuana to this patient's home.  Many people at the hospital  
supported the patient's marijuana therapy, none doubted its helpfulness  
or discouraged it.  This patient was asked for help by other patients.   
He taught some who lived nearby how to form the marijuana cigarettes and  
properly inhale the smoke to obtain relief from nausea and vomiting.   
When an article about this patient's smoking marijuana appeared in a  
local newspaper, he and his family heard from many other cancer patients  
who were doing the same.  Most of them made an effort to inform their  
doctors.  Most Physicians who knew their patients smoked marijuana  
medicinally approved, accepting marijuana's therapeutic helpfulness in  
reducing nausea and vomiting. 

         28.  In October 1979 the Michigan legislature enacted  
legislation whose underlying purpose was to make marijuana available  
therapeutically for cancer patients and others.  The State Senate passed  
the bill 29-5, the House of Representatives 100-0.  In March 1982 the  
Michigan legislature passed a resolution asking the Federal Congress to  
try to alter Federal policies which prevent physicians from prescribing  
marijuana for legitimate medical applications and prohibit its use in  
medical treatments. 

         29.  In Denver, Colorado a teenage cancer patient has been  
smoking marijuana to control nausea and vomiting since 1986.  He has done  
this in his hospital room both before and after chemotherapy.  His doctor  
and hospital staff know he does this.  The doctor has stated that he  
would prescribe marijuana for 

                                  - 20 -

<PRE>
this patient if it were legal to do so.  Other patients in the Denver  
area smoke marijuana for the same purpose.  This patient's doctor, and  
nurses with whom he comes in contact, understand that cancer patients  
smoke marijuana to reduce or control emesis.  They accept it. 

         30.  In late 1980 a three year old boy was brought by his  
parents to a hospital in Spokane, Washington.  The child was diagnosed as  
having cancer.  Surgery was performed.  Chemotherapy was begun.  The  
child became extremely nauseated and vomited for days after each  
chemotherapy treatment.  He could not eat regularly.  He lost strength.   
He lost weight.  His body's ability to ward off common infections, other  
life-threatening infections, significantly decreased.  Chemotherapy's  
after-effects caused the child great suffering.  They caused his watching  
parents great suffering.  Several standard, available anti-emetic agents  
were tried by the child's doctors.  None of them succeeded in controlling  
his nausea or vomiting.  Learning of the existence of research studies  
with THC or marijuana the parents asked the child's doctor to arrange for  
their son to be the subject of such a study so that he might have access  
to marijuana.  The doctor refused, citing the volume of paperwork and  
record-keeping detail required in such programs and his lack of  
administrative personnel to handle it. 

         31.  The child's mother read an article about marijuana smoking  
helping chemotherapy patients.  She obtained some marijuana from friends.   
She baked cookies for her child with marijuana in them.  She made tea for  
him with marijuana in it.  When the child ate these cookies or drank this  
tea in connection with his chemotherapy, he did not vomit.  His strength  
returned.  He regained lost weight.  His spirits revived.  The parents  
told the doctors and nurses at the hospital of their giving marijuana to  
their child.  None objected. 

                                  - 21 -

<HR>

<PRE>
They all accepted smoking marijuana as effective in controlling  
chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.  They were interested to see  
the results of the cookies. 

         32.  Soon this child was riding a tricycle in the hallways of  
the Spokane hospital shortly after his chemotherapy treatments while  
other children there were still vomiting into pans, tied to intravenous  
bottles in an attempt to re-hydrate them, to replace the liquids they  
were vomiting up.  Parents of some of the other patients asked the  
parents of this &quot;lively&quot; child how he seemed to tolerate his chemotherapy  
so well.  They told of the marijuana use.  Of those parents who began  
giving marijuana to their children, none ever reported back encountering  
any adverse side effects.  In the vast majority of these cases, the other  
parents reported significant reduction in their children's vomiting and  
appetite stimulation as the result of marijuana.  The staff, doctors and  
nurses at the hospital knew of this passing on of information about  
marijuana to other parents.  They approved.  They never told the first  
parents to hide their son's medicinal use of marijuana.  They accepted  
the effectiveness of the cookies and the tea containing marijuana. 

         33.  The first child's cancer went into remission.  Then it  
returned and spread.  Emotionally drained, the parents moved the family  
back to San Diego, California to be near their own parents.  Their son  
was admitted to a hospital in San Diego.  The parents informed the  
doctors, nurses and social workers there of their son's therapeutic use  
of marijuana.  No one objected.  The child's doctor in San Diego strongly  
supported the parent's giving marijuana to him.  Here in California, as  
in Spokane, other parents noticed the striking difference between their  
children after chemotherapy and the first child. 

                                  - 22 -

Other parents asked the parents of the first child about it, were told of 
the use of marijuana, tried it with their children, and saw dramatic 
improvement.  They accepted its effectiveness.  In the words of the  
mother of the first child: &quot;. . . When your kid is riding a tricycle  
while his other hospital buddies are hooked up to IV needles, their heads  
hung over vomiting buckets, you don't need a federal agency to tell you  
marijuana is effective.  The evidence is in front of you, so stark it  
cannot be ignored.&quot;  [footnote 6] 

         34.  There is at least one hospital in Tucson, Arizona where  
medicinal use of marijuana by chemotherapy patients is encouraged by the  
nursing staff and some physicians. 

         35.  In addition to the physicians mentioned in the Findings  
above, mostly oncologists and other practitioners, the following doctors  
and health care professionals, representing several different areas of 
expertise, accept marijuana as medically useful in controlling or  
reducing emesis and testified to that effect in these proceedings: 

               a.  George Goldstein, Ph.D., psychologist, Secretary of  
Health for the State of New Mexico from 1978 to 1983 and chief  
administrator in the implementation of the New Mexico program utilizing  
marijuana; 

               b.  Dr. Daniel Danzak, psychiatrist and former head of the  
New Mexico program utilizing marijuana; 

               c.  Dr. Tod Mikuriya, psychiatrist and editor of  
Marijuana: Medical Papers, a book presenting an historical perspective of  
marijuana's medical use; 

               d.  Dr. Norman Zinberg, general psychiatrist and Professor  
of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School since 1951;

City University of New York; 

               f.  Dr. Phillip Jobe, neuropsychopharmacologist with a

at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine in Shreveport,  
Louisiana, from 1974 to 1984; 

               g.  Dr. Arthur Kaufman, formerly a general practitioner in  
Maryland, currently Vice-President of a private medical consulting group  
involved in the evaluation of the quality of care of all the U.S.  
military hospitals throughout the world, who has had extensive experience  
in drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation programs; 

               h.  Dr. J. Thomas Ungerleider, a full Professor of  
Psychiatry at the University of California in Los Angeles with extensive  
experience in research on the medical use of drugs; 

               i.  Dr. Andrew Weil, ethnopharmacologist, Associate  
Director of Social Perspectives in Medicine at the College of Medicine at  
the University of Arizona, with extensive research on medicinal plants;  
and 

               j.  Dr. Lester Grinspoon, a practicing psychiatrist and  
Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School. 

         36.  Certain law enforcement authorities have been outspoken in  
their acceptance of marijuana as an antiemetic agent.  Robert T. Stephan,  
Attorney General of the State of Kansas, and himself a former cancer  
patient, said of chemotherapy in his affidavit in this record: &quot;The  
treatment becomes a terror.&quot;  His cancer is now in remission.  He came to  
know a number of health care professionals whose medical judgment he  
respected.  They had accepted marijuana 

                                  - 24 -

<PRE>
as having medical use in treatment.  He was elected Vice President of the  
National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) in 1983.  He was  
instrumental in the adoption by that body in June 1983 of a resolution  
acknowledging the efficacy of marijuana for cancer and glaucoma patients.   
The resolution expressed the support of NAAG for legislation then pending  
in the Congress to make marijuana available on prescription to cancer and  
glaucoma patients.  The resolution was adopted by an overwhelming margin.   
NAAG's President, the Attorney General of Montana, issued a statement  
that marijuana does have accepted medical uses and is improperly  
classified at present.  The Chairman of NAAG's Criminal Law and Law  
Enforcement Committee, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, issued a  
statement emphasizing that the proposed rescheduling of marijuana would  
in no way affect or impede existing efforts by law enforcement  
authorities to crack down on illegal drug trafficking. 

         37.  At least one court has accepted marijuana as having medical  
use in treatment for chemotherapy patients.  On January 23, 1978 the  
Superior Court of Imperial County, California issued orders authorizing a  
cancer patient to possess and use marijuana for therapeutic purposes  
under the direction of a physician.  Another order authorized and  
directed the Sheriff of the county to release marijuana from supplies on  
hand and deliver it to that patient in such form as to be usable in the  
form of cigarettes. 

         38.  During the period 1978-1980 polls were taken to ascertain  
the degree of public acceptance of marijuana as effective in treating  
cancer and glaucoma patients.  A poll in Nebraska brought slightly over  
1,000 responses - 83% favored making marijuana available by prescription,  
12% were opposed, 5% were undecided.  A poll in Pennsylvania elicited  
1,008 responses - 83.1% favored availability by prescription, 12.2% were  
opposed, 4.7% were undecided.  These 

                                  - 25 -

<HR>

<PRE>
two surveys were conducted by professional polling companies.  The  
Detroit Free Press conducted a telephone poll in which 85.4% of those  
responding favored access to marijuana by prescription.  In the State of  
Washington the State Medical Association conducted a poll in which 80% of  
the doctors belonging to the Association favored controlled availability  
of marijuana for medical purposes. 


Discussion 

     From the foregoing uncontroverted facts it is clear beyond any  
question that many people find marijuana to have, in the words of the  
Act, an &quot;accepted medical use in treatment in the United States&quot; in  
effecting relief for cancer patients.  Oncologists, physicians treating  
cancer patients, accept this.  Other medical practitioners and  
researchers accept this.  Medical faculty professors accept it.  Nurses  
performing hands-on patient care accept it. 

     Patients accept it.  As counsel for CCA perceptively pointed out at  
oral argument, acceptance by the patient is of vital importance.  Doctors  
accept a therapeutic agent or process only if it &quot;works&quot; for the patient.   
If the patient does not accept, the doctor cannot administer the  
treatment.  The patient's informed consent is vital.  The doctor  
ascertains the patient's acceptance by observing and listening to the  
patient.  Acceptance by the doctor depends on what he sees in the patient  
and hears from the patient.  Unquestionably, patients in large numbers  
have accepted marijuana as useful in treating their emesis.  They have  
found that it &quot;works&quot;.  Doctors, evaluating their patients, can have 
no basis more sound than that for their own acceptance. 

     Of relevance, also, is the acceptance of marijuana by state  
attorneys- 

                                  - 26 -

general, officials whose primary concern is law enforcement.  A large  
number of them have no fear that placing marijuana in Schedule II, thus  
making it available for legitimate therapy, will in any way impede  
existing efforts of law enforcement authorities to crack down on illegal  
drug trafficking. 

     The Act does not specify by whom a drug or substance must be  
&quot;accepted [for] medical use in treatment&quot; in order to meet the Act's  
&quot;accepted&quot; requirement for placement in Schedule II.  Department of  
Justice witnesses told the Congress during hearings in 1970 preceding  
passage of the Act that &quot;the medical Profession&quot; would make this  
determination, that the matter would be &quot;determined by the medical  
community.&quot;  The Deputy Chief Counsel of BNDD, whose office had written  
the bill with this language in it, told the House subcommittee that &quot;this  
basic determination . . . is not made by any part of the federal  
government.  It is made by the medical community as to whether or not the  
drug has medical use or doesn't&quot;. [footnote 7] 

     No one would seriously contend that these Justice Department  
witnesses meant that the entire medical community would have to be in  
agreement on the usefulness of a drug or substance.  Seldom, if ever, do  
all lawyers agree on a point of law.  Seldom, if ever, do all doctors  
agree on a medical question.  How many are required here?  A majority of  
51%?  It would be unrealistic to attempt a plebiscite of all doctors in  
the country on such a question every time it arises, to obtain a majority  
vote. 

     In determining whether a medical procedure utilized by a doctor is 
actionable as malpractice the courts have adopted the rule what it is  
acceptable

for a doctor to employ a method of treatment supported by a respectable  
minority of physicians. 

     In Hood v. Phillips, 537 S.W. 2d 291 (1976) the Texas Court of Civil  
Appeals was dealing with a claim of medical malpractice resulting from a  
surgical procedure claimed to have been unnecessary.  The court quoted  
from an Arizona court decision holding that 

          a method of treatment, as espoused and used by . . . a 
          respectable minority of physicians in the United States, 
          cannot be said to be an inappropriate method of treat- 
          ment or to be malpractice as a matter of law even though 
          it has not been accepted as a proper method of treatment 
          by the medical profession generally. 

Ibid. at 294.  Noting that the Federal District court in the Arizona case 
found a &quot;respectable minority&quot; composed of sixty-five physicians  
throughout the United States, the Texas court adopted as &quot;the better  
rule&quot; to apply in its case, that 

          a physician is not guilty of malpractice where the 
          method of treatment used is supported by a respect- 
          able minority of physicians. 

Ibid. 

     In Chumbler v. McClure, 505 F.2d 489 (6th Cir. 1974) the Federal  
courts were dealing with a medical malpractice case under their diversity  
jurisdiction, applying Tennessee law, The Court of Appeals said: 

          . . . The most favorable interpretation that may be 
          placed on the testimony adduced at trial below is 
          that there is a division of opinion in the medical 
          profession regarding the use of Premarin in the Treat- 
          ment of cerebral vascular insufficiency, and that Dr. 
          McClure was alone among neurosurgeons in Nashville in 
          using such therapy.  The test for malpractice and for 
          community standards is not to be determined solely by 
          a plebiscite.  Where two or more schools of thought 
          exist among competent members of the medical profes- 
          sion concerning proper medical treatment for a given 
          ailment, each of which is supported by responsible

          medical authority, it is not malpractice to be among 
          the minority in a given city who follow: one of the 
          accepted schools. 

505 F.2d at 492 (Emphasis added).  See, also, Leech v. Bralliar, 275  
F.Supp. 897 (D.Ariz., 1967). 

     How do we ascertain whether there exists a school of thought  
supported by responsible medical authority, and thus &quot;accepted&quot;?  We  
listen to the physicians. 

               The court and jury must have a standard measure 
          which they are to use in measuring the acts of a 
          doctor to determine whether he exercised a reasonable 
          degree of care and skill; they are not permitted to 
          set up and use any arbitrary or artificial standard 
          of measurement that the jury may wish to apply.  The 
          proper standard of measurement is to be established 
          by testimony of physicians, for it is a medical 
          question. 

Hayes v. Brown, 133 S.E. 2d. 102 (Ga., 1963) at 105. 

     As noted above, there is no question but that this record shows a  
great many physicians, and others, to have &quot;accepted&quot; marijuana as having  
a medical use in the treatment of cancer patients' emesis.  True, all  
physicians have not &quot;accepted&quot; it.  But to require universal, 100%  
acceptance would be unreasonable.  Acceptance by &quot;a respectable minority&quot;  
of physicians is all that can reasonably be required.  The record here  
establishes conclusively that at least &quot;a respectable minority&quot; of  
physicians has &quot;accepted&quot; marijuana as having a &quot;medical use in treatment  
in the United states.&quot;  That others may not makes no difference. 

     The administrative law judge recommended this same approach for  
determining whether a drug has an &quot;accepted medical use in treatment&quot; in  
The Matter Of MDMA Scheduling, Docket No. 84-48.  The Administrator, in  
his first final rule in that proceeding, issued on October 8, 1986  
[footnote 8], declined to adopt this approach.  He

ruled, instead, that DEA's decision on whether or not a drug or other 
substance had an accepted medical use in treatment in the United States 
would be determined simply by ascertaining whether or not &quot;the drug or 
other substance is lawfully marketed in the United States pursuant to 
the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 . . . .&quot; [footnote 9] 

     The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that  
the Administrator erred in so ruling. [footnote 10]  That court vacated  
the final order of October 8, 1986 and remanded the matter of MDMA's  
scheduling for further consideration.  The court directed that, on  
remand, the Administrator would not be permitted to treat the absence of  
interstate marketing approval by FDA as conclusive evidence on the  
question of accepted medical use under the Act. 

     In his third final rule [footnote 11] of the matter of the  
scheduling of MDMA the Administrator made a series of findings of fact as  
to MDMA, the drug there under consideration, with respect to the evidence  
in that record.  On those findings he based his last final rule in the  
case. [footnote 12]

     January 20, 1988.  It merely removed MDMA from Schedule I pursuant 
     to the mandate of the Court of Appeals which had voided the first 
     final rule placing it there.  Subsequently the third final rule was 
     issued, without any further hearings, again placing MDMA in Schedule 
     I.  There was no further appeal. 

12   In neither the first nor the third final rule in the MDMA case does 
     the Administrator take any cognizance of the statements to the 
     Congressional committee by predecessor Agency officials that the 
     determination as to &quot;accepted medical use in treatment&quot; is to be 
     made by the medical community and not by any part of the federal 
     government.  See page 27, above.  It is curious that the 
     administrator makes no effort whatever to show how the BNDD 
     representatives were mistaken or to explain why he now has abandoned 
     their interpretation.  They wrote that language into the original 
     bill.

That third final rule dealing with MDMA is dealing with a synthetic,  
&quot;simple&quot;, &quot;single-action&quot; drug.  What might be appropriate criteria for a  
&quot;simple&quot; drug like MDMA may not be appropriate for a &quot;complex&quot; substance  
with a number of active components.  The criteria applied to MDMA, a  
synthetic drug, are not appropriate for application to marijuana, which  
is a natural plant substance. 

     The First Circuit Court of Appeals in the MDMA case told the  
Administrator that he should not treat the absence of FDA interstate  
marketing approval as conclusive evidence of lack of currently accepted  
medical use.  The court did not forbid the Administrator from considering  
the absence of FDA approval as a factor when determining the existence of  
accepted medical use.  Yet on remand, in his third final order, the  
Administrator adopted by reference 18 of the numbered findings he had  
made in the first final order.  Each of these findings had to do with  
requirements imposed by FDA for approval of a new drug application (NDA)  
or of an investigational new drug exemption (IND).  These requirements  
deal with data resulting from controlled studies and scientifically  
conducted investigations and test. 

     Among those findings incorporated into the third final MDMA order  
from the first, and relied on by the Administrator, was the determination  
and recommendation of the FDA that the drug there in question was not  
&quot;accepted&quot;.  In relying on the FDA's action the Administrator apparently  
overlooked the fact that the FDA clearly stated that it was interpreting  
&quot;accepted medical use&quot; in the Act as being equivalent to receiving FDA  
approval for lawful marketing under the FDCA.  Thus the Administrator  
accepted as a basis for his MDMA third final rule the FDA recommendation  
which was based upon a statutory interpretation which the Court 

                                  - 31 - 
</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>
of Appeals had condemned. 

     The Administrator in that third final rule made a series of further  
findings.  Again, the central concern in these findings was the content  
of test results and the sufficiency or adequacy of studies and scientific  
reports.  A careful reading of the criteria considered in the MDMA third  
final order reveals that the Administrator was really considering the  
question: Should the drug be accepted for medical use?; rather than the  
question: Has the drug been accepted for medical use?  By considering  
little else but scientific test results and reports the Administrator  
was making a determination as to whether or not, in his opinion, MDMA  
ought to be accepted for medical use in treatment. 

     The Agency's arguments in the present case are to the same effect.   
In a word, they address the wrong question.  It is not for this Agency to  
tell doctors whether they should or should not accept a drug or substance  
for medical use.  The statute directs the Administrator merely to  
ascertain whether, in fact, doctors have done so. 

     The MDMA third final order mistakenly looks to FDA criteria for  
guidance in choosing criteria for DEA to apply.  Under the Food, Drug and  
Cosmetic Act the FDA is deciding - properly, under that statute - whether  
a new drug should be introduced into interstate commerce.  Thus it is  
appropriate for the FDA to rely heavily on test results and scientific  
inquiry to ascertain whether a drug is effective and whether it is safe.   
The FDA must look at a drug and pass judgment on its intrinsic  
qualities.  The DEA, on the other hand, is charged by 21 U.S.C. &#167;  
812(b)(1)(B) and (2)(B) with ascertaining what it is that other people  
have done with respect to a drug or substance: &quot;Have they accepted it?;&quot;  
not &quot;Should they accept it?&quot; 

                                  - 32 -

<HR>

<PRE>
In the MDMA third final order DEA is actually making the decision  
that doctors have to make, rather than trying to ascertain the decision  
which doctors have made.  Consciously or not, the Agency is undertaking  
to tell doctors what they should or should not accept.  In so doing the  
Agency is acting beyond the authority granted in the Act. 

     It is entirely proper for the Administrator to consider the  
pharmacology of a drug and scientific test results in connection with  
determining abuse potential.  But abuse potential is not in issue in this  
marijuana proceeding. 

     There is another reason why DEA should not be guided by FDA criteria  
in ascertaining whether or not marijuana has an accepted medical use in  
treatment.  These criteria are applied by FDA pursuant to Section 505 of  
the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), as amended. [footnote 13]   
When the FDA is making an inquiry pursuant to that legislation it is  
looking at a synthetically formed new drug.  The marijuana plant is  
anything but a new drug.  Uncontroverted evidence in this record  
indicates that marijuana was being used therapeutically by mankind 2000  
years before the Birth of Christ. [footnote 14] 

     Uncontroverted evidence further establishes that in this country  
today &quot;new drugs&quot; are developed by pharmaceutical companies possessing  
resources sufficient to bear the enormous expense of testing a new drug,  
obtaining FDA approval of its efficacy and safety, and marketing it  
successfully.  No company undertakes the investment required unless it  
has a patent on the drug, so it can recoup its development costs and make  
a profit.  At oral argument Government counsel conceded that &quot;the FDA  
system is constructed for pharmaceutical companies.  I won't

deny that.&quot; [footnote 15] 

     Since the substance being considered in this case is a natural plant  
rather than a synthetic drug, it is unreasonable to make FDA-type  
criteria determinative of the issue in this case, particularly so when  
such criteria are irrelevant to the question posed by the act: does the  
substance have an accepted medical use in treatment? 

     Finally, the Agency in this proceeding relies in part on the FDA's 
recommendation that the Administrator retain marijuana in Schedule I.   
But, as in the MDMA case, that recommendation is based upon FDA's  
equating &quot;accepted medical use&quot; under the Act with being approved for  
marketing by FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the  
interpretation condemned by the First Circuit in the MDMA case.  See  
Attachment A, p.24, to exhibit G-1 and exhibit G-2. 

     The overwhelming preponderance of the evidence in this record  
establishes that marijuana has a currently accepted medical use in  
treatment in the United States for nausea and vomiting resulting from  
chemotherapy treatments in some cancer patients.  To conclude otherwise,  
on this record, would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious.

                    ACCEPTED MEDICAL USE IN TREATMENT
                               - GLAUCOMA


Findings of Fact

     The preponderance of the evidence establishes the following facts 
with respect to the accepted medical use of marijuana in the treatment of
glaucoma.

          1.  Glaucoma is a disease of the eye characterized by the 
excessive accumulation of fluid causing increased intraocular pressure, 
distorted vision and, ultimately, blindness.  In its early stages this 
pressure can sometimes be relieved by the administration of drugs.  When 
such medical treatment fails adequately to reduce the intraocular 
pressure (IOP), surgery is generally resorted to.  Although useful in 
many cases, there is a high incidence of failure with some types of 
surgery.  Further, serious complications can occur as a result of 
invasive surgery.  Newer, non-invasive procedures such as laser 
trabeculoplasty are thought by some to offer much greater efficacy with 
fewer complications.  Unless the IOP is relieved and brought to a 
satisfactory level by one means or another, the patient will go blind.

          2.  Two highly qualified and experienced ophthalmologists in 
the United States have accepted marijuana as having a medical use in 
treatment for glaucoma.  They are John C. Merritt, M.D. and Richard D. 
North, M.D.  Each of them is both a clinician, treating patients, and a 
researcher.  Dr. Merritt is also a professor of ophthalmology.  Dr. North 
has served as a medical officer in ophthalmology for the Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare and has worked with the Public Health 
Service and FDA.
                                 - 35 -
<hr>
          3.  Dr. Merritt's experience with glaucoma patients using 
marijuana medicinally includes one Robert Randall and, insofar as the 
evidence here establishes per petitioners' briefs, an unspecified number 
of other patients, something in excess of 40.

          4.  Dr. North has treated only one glaucoma patient using 
marijuana medicinally - the same Robert Randall mentioned immediately 
above.  Dr. North had monitored Mr. Randall's medicinal use of marijuana 
for nine years as of May 1987

          5.  Dr. Merritt has accepted marijuana as having an important 
place in the treatment of "End Stage" glaucoma.  "End Stage" glaucoma, 
essentially, defines a patient who has already lost substantial amounts 
of vision; available glaucoma control drugs are no longer able adequately 
to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) to prevent further, progressive 
sight loss; the patient, lacking additional IOP reductions, will go 
blind.

          6.  Robert S. Hepler, M.D., is a highly qualified and 
experienced ophthalmologist.  He has done research with respect to the 
effect of smoking marijuana on glaucoma.  In December 1975 he prescribed 
marijuana for the same Robert Randall mentioned above as a research 
subject.  Dr. Hepler found that large dosages of smoked marijuana 
effectively reduced Robert Randall's IOP into the safe range over an 
entire test day.  He concluded that the only known alternative to 
preserve Randall's sight which would avoid the significant risks of 
surgery is to include marijuana as part of Randall's prescribed medical 
regimen.  He further concluded in 1977 that, if marijuana could have been 
legally prescribed, he would have prescribed it for Randall as part of 
Randall's regular glaucoma maintenance program had he been Randall's 
personal physician.
                                 - 36 -
<hr>
Nonetheless, in 1987 Dr. Hepler was of the opinion that marijuana did
not have a currently accepted medical use in the United States for the
treatment of glaucoma.

          7.  Four glaucoma patients testified in these proceedings.  
Each has found marijuana to be of help in controlling IOP.

          8.  In 1984 the treatment of glaucoma with Cannabis was the 
subject of an Ophthalmology Grand Rounds at the University of California, 
San Francisco.  A questionnaire was distributed which queried the 
ophthalmologists on cannabis therapy for glaucoma patients refractory to 
standard treatment.  Many of them have glaucoma patients who have asked 
about marijuana.  Most of the responding ophthalmologists believed that 
THC capsules or smoked marijuana need to be available for patients who 
have not benefited significantly from standard treatment.

          9.  In about 1978 an unspecified number of persons in the 
public health service sector in New Mexico, including some physicians, 
accepted marijuana as having medical use in treating glaucoma.

         10.  A majority of an unspecified number of ophthalmologists 
known to Arthur Kaufman, M.D., who was formerly in general practice but 
now is employed as a medical program administrator, accept marijuana as 
having medical use in treatment of glaucoma.

         11.  In addition to the physicians identified and referred to in 
the findings above, the testimony of patients in this record establishes 
that no more than three or four other physicians consider marijuana to be 
medically useful in the treatment of glaucoma in the United States.  One 
of those Physicians actually wrote a prescription for marijuana for a 
patient, which, of course, she was unable to have filled.

                                 - 37 -
<hr>
         12.  There are test results showing that smoking marijuana has 
reduced the IOP in some glaucoma patients.  There is continuing research 
underway in the United States as to the therapeutic effect of marijuana 
on glaucoma.


Discussion

     Petitioners' briefs fail to show that the preponderance of the 
evidence in the record with respect to marijuana and glaucoma establishes 
that a respectable minority of physicians accepts marijuana as being 
useful in the treatment of glaucoma in the United States.

     This conclusion is not to be taken in any way as criticism of the 
opinions of the ophthalmologists who testified that they accept marijuana 
for this purpose.  The failure lies with petitioners.  In their briefs 
they do not point out hard, specific evidence in this record sufficient 
to establish that a respectable minority of physicians has accepted their 
position.

     There is a great volume of evidence here, and much discussion in the 
briefs, about the protracted case of Robert Randall.  But when all is 
said and done, his experience presents but one case.  The record contains 
sworn testimony of three ophthalmologists who have treated Mr. Randall.  
One of them tells us of a relatively small number of other glaucoma 
patients whom he has treated with marijuana and whom he knows to have 
responded favorably.  Another of these three doctors has successfully 
treated only Randall with marijuana.  The third testifies, despite his 
successful experience in treating Randall, that marijuana does not have 
an accepted use in such treatment.

     In addition to Robert Randall, Petitioners point to the testimony of 
three other glaucoma patients.  Their case histories are impressive, but 
they contribute

                                 - 38 -
<hr>
little to the carrying of Petitioner's burden of showing that marijuana 
is accepted for medical treatment of glaucoma by a respectable minority 
of physicians.  See pages 26-29, above.

     Petitioners have in evidence copies of a number of newspaper 
clippings reporting statements by persons claiming that marijuana has 
helped their glaucoma.  The administrative law judge is unable to give 
significant weight to this evidence.  Had these persons testified so as 
to have been subject to cross-examination, a different situation would be 
presented.  But these newspaper reports of extra-judicial statements, 
neither tested by informed inquiry nor supported by a doctor's opinion, 
are not entitled to much weight.  They are of little, if any, 
materiality.

     Beyond the evidence referred to above there is a little other "hard" 
evidence, pointed out by petitioners, of Physicians accepting marijuana 
for treatment of glaucoma.  Such evidence as that concerning a survey of 
a group of San Francisco ophthalmologists is ambiguous, at best.  The 
relevant document establishes merely that most of the doctors on the 
grand round, who responded to an inquiry, believed that the THC capsules 
or marijuana ought to be available.

     In sum, the evidence here tending to show that marijuana is accepted 
for treatment of glaucoma falls far, far short of quantum of evidence 
tending to show that marijuana is accepted for treatment of emesis in 
cancer patients.  The preponderance of the evidence here, identified by 
petitioners in their briefs, does not establish that a respectable 
minority of physicians has accepted marijuana for glaucoma treatment.

                   ACCEPTED MEDICAL USE IN TREATMENT
                    - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, SPASTICITY
                        AND HYPERPARATHYROIDISM


Findings Of Fact

     The preponderance of the evidence clearly establishes the following 
facts with respect to marijuana's use in connection with multiple 
sclerosis, spasticity and hyperparathyroidism.

          1.  Multiple sclerosis is the major cause of neurological 
disability among young and middle-aged adults in the United States today.  
It is a life-long disease.  It can be extremely debilitating to some of 
its victims but it does not shorten the life span of most of them.  Its 
cause is yet to be determined.  It attacks the myelin sheath, the coating 
or insulation surrounding the message-carrying nerve fibers in the brain 
and spinal cord.  Once the myelin sheath is destroyed, it is replaced by 
plaques of hardened tissue known as sclerosis.  During the initial stages 
of the disease nerve impulses are transmitted with only minor 
interruptions.  As the disease progresses, the plaques may completely 
obstruct the impulses along certain nerve systems.  These obstructions 
produce malfunctions.  The effects are sporadic in most individuals and 
the effects often occur episodically, triggered either by malfunction of 
the nerve impulses or by external factors.

          2.  Over time many patients develop spasticity, the involuntary 
and abnormal contraction of muscle or muscle fibers.  (Spasticity can 
also result from serious injuries to the spinal cord, not related to 
multiple sclerosis.)

          3.  The symptoms of multiple sclerosis vary according to the 
area of

                                 - 40 -
<hr>
the nervous system which is affected and according to the severity of the 
disease.  The symptoms can include one or more of the following:  
weakness, tingling, numbness, impaired sensation, lack of coordination, 
disturbances in equilibrium, double vision, loss of vision, involuntary 
rapid movement of the eyes (nystagmus), slurred speech, tremors, 
stiffness, spasticity, weakness of limbs, sexual dysfunction, paralysis, 
and impaired bladder and bowel functions.

          4.  Each person afflicted by multiple sclerosis is affected 
differently.  In some persons, the symptoms of the disease are barely 
detectable, even over long periods of time.  In these cases, the persons 
can live their lives as if they did not suffer from the disease.  In 
others, more of the symptoms are present and acute, thereby limiting 
their physical capabilities.  Moreover, others may experience sporadic, 
but acute, symptoms.

          5.  At this time, there is no known prevention or cure for 
multiple sclerosis.  Instead, there are only treatments for the symptoms 
of the disease.  There are very few drugs specifically designed to treat
spasticity.  These drugs often cause very serious side effects.  At the 
present time two drugs are approved by FDA as "safe" and "effective" for 
the specific indication of spasticity.  These drugs are Dantrium and 
Lioresal baclofen.

          6.  Unfortunately, neither Dantrium nor Lioresal is a very 
effective spasm control drug.  Their marginal medical utility, high 
toxicity and potential for serious adverse effects make these drugs 
difficult to use in spasticity therapy.

          7.  As a result, many physicians routinely prescribe 
tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, mood elevators and sedatives such as 
Valium to patients experiencing spasticity.  While these drugs do not 
directly reduce spasticity

                                 - 41 -
<hr>
they may weaken the patient's muscle tone, thus making the spasms less 
noticeable.  Alternatively, they may induce sleep or so tranquilize the 
patient that normal mental and physical functions are impossible.

          8.  A healthy, athletic young woman named Valerie Cover was 
stricken with multiple sclerosis while in her early twenties.  She 
consulted several medical specialists and followed all the customary 
regimens and prescribed methods for coping with this debilitating disease 
over a period of several years.  None of these proved availing.  Two 
years after first experiencing the symptoms of multiple sclerosis her 
active, productive life - as an athlete, Navy officer's wife and mother - 
was effectively over.  The Social Security Administration declared her 
totally disabled.  To move about her home she had to sit on a skateboard 
and push herself around.  She spent most of her time in bed or sitting in 
a wheelchair.

          9.  An occasional marijuana smoker in her teens, before her 
marriage, she had not smoked it for five years as of February 1986.  Then 
a neighbor suggested that marijuana just might help Mrs. Cover's multiple 
sclerosis, having read that it had helped cancer patient's control their 
emesis.  Mrs. Cover acceded to the suggestion.

         10.  Just before smoking the marijuana cigarette produced by her 
neighbor, Mrs. Cover had been throwing up and suffering from spasms.  
Within five minutes of smoking part of the marijuana cigarette she 
stopped vomiting, no longer felt nauseous and noticed that the intensity 
of her spasms was significantly reduced.  She stood up unaided.

         11.  Mrs. Cover began smoking marijuana whenever she felt 
nauseated.  When she did so it controlled her vomiting, stopped the 
nausea and increased her

                                 - 42 -
<hr>
appetite.  It helped ease and control her spasticity.  Her limbs were 
much easier to control.  After three months of smoking marijuana she 
could walk unassisted, had regained all of her lost weight, her seizures 
became almost nonexistent.  She could again care for her children.  She 
could drive an automobile again.  She regained the ability to lead a 
normal life.

         12.  Concerned that her use of this illegal substance might 
jeopardize the career of her Navy officer husband, Mrs. Cover stopped 
smoking marijuana several times.  Each time she did so, after about a 
month, she had retrogressed to the point that her multiple sclerosis 
again had her confined to bed and wheelchair or skateboard.  As of the 
Spring of 1987 Mrs. Cover had resumed smoking marijuana regularly on an 
"as needed" basis.  Her multiple sclerosis symptoms are under excellent
control.  She has obtained a full-time job.  She still needs a wheelchair 
on rare occasions, but generally has full use of her limbs and can walk 
around with relative ease.

         13.  Mrs. Cover's doctor has accepted the effectiveness of 
marijuana in her case.  He questioned her closely about her use of it, 
telling her that it is the most effective drug known in reducing 
vomiting.  Mrs. Cover and her doctor are now in the process of filing an 
Investigational New Drug (IND) application with FDA so that she can 
legally obtain the marijuana she needs to lead a reasonably normal life.

         14.  Martha Hirsch is a young woman in her mid-thirties.  She 
first exhibited symptoms of multiple sclerosis at age 19 and it was 
diagnosed at that time.  Her condition has grown progressively worse.  
She has been under the care of physicians and hospitalized for treatment.  
Many drugs have been prescribed for her by her doctors.  At one point in 
1983 she listed the drugs that had been

                                 - 43 -
<hr>
prescribed for her.  There were 17 on the list.  None of them has given 
her the relief from her multiple sclerosis symptoms that marijuana has.

         15.  During the early stages in the development of her illness 
Ms. Hirsch found that smoking marijuana improved the quality of her life, 
keeping her spasms under control.  Her balance improved.  She seldom 
needed to use her cane for support.  Her condition lately has 
deteriorated.  As of May l987 she was experiencing severe, painful 
spasms.  She had an indwelling catheter in her bladder.  She had lost her 
locomotive abilities and was wheelchair bound.  She could seldom find 
marijuana on the illegal market and, when she did, she often could not 
afford to purchase it.  When she did obtain some, however, and smoked it, 
her entire body seemed to relax, her spasms decreased or disappeared, she 
slept better and her dizzy spells vanished.  The relaxation of her leg 
muscles after smoking marijuana has been confirmed by her personal care 
attendant's examination of them.

         16.  The personal care attendant has told Ms. Hirsch that she, 
the attendant, treats a number of patients who smoke marijuana for relief 
of multiple sclerosis symptoms.  In about 1980 another patient told Ms. 
Hirsch that he knew many patients who smoke marijuana to relieve their 
spasms.  Through him she met other patients and found that marijuana was 
commonly used by many multiple sclerosis patients.  Most of these persons 
had told their doctors about their doing so.  None of those doctors 
advised against the practice and some encouraged it.

         17.  Among the drugs prescribed by doctors for Ms. Hirsch was 
ACTH.  This failed to give her any therapeutic benefit or to control her 
spasticity.  It did produce a number of adverse effects, including severe 
nausea and vomiting which, in turn, were partly controlled by rectally 
administered anti-emetic

                                 - 44 -
<hr>
drugs.

         18.  Another drug prescribed for her was Lioresal, intended to 
reduce her spasms.  It was not very effective in doing.  But it did cause 
Ms. Hirsch to have hallucinations.  On two occasions, while using this 
drug, Ms. Hirsch "saw" a large fire in her bedroom and called for help.  
There was no fire.  She stopped using that drug.  Ms. Hirsch has 
experienced no adverse reactions with marijuana.

         19.  Ms. Hirsch's doctor has accepted marijuana as beneficial 
for her.  He agreed to write her a prescription for it, if that would 
help her obtain it.  She has asked him if he would file an IND 
application with the FDA for her.  He replied that the paperwork was 
"overwhelming".  He indicated willingness to put the paper work together.

         20.  When Greg Paufler was in his early twenties, employed by 
Prudential Insurance Company, he began to experience the first symptoms 
of multiple sclerosis.  His condition worsened as the disease 
intensified.  He had to be hospitalized.  He lost the ability to walk, to 
stand.  Diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis, a doctor prescribed ACTH 
for him, an intensive form of steroid therapy.  He lost all control over 
his limbs and experienced severe, painful spasms.  His arms and legs 
became numb.

         21.  ACTH had no beneficial effects.  The doctor continued to 
prescribe it many months.  ACTH made Paufler ravenously hungry and he 
began gaining a great deal of weight.  ACTH caused fluid retention and 
Paufler became bloated, rapidly gaining weight.  His doctor thought 
Paufler should continue this steroid therapy, even though it caused the 
adverse effects mentioned plus the possibility of sudden heart attack or 
death due to respiratory failure.  Increased dosages

                                 - 45 -
<hr>
of this FDA-approved drug caused fluid to press against Paufler's lungs 
making it difficult for him to breathe and causing his legs and feet to 
become swollen.  The steroid therapy caused severe, intense depression 
marked by abrupt mood shifts.  Throughout, the spasms continued and 
Paufler's limbs remained out of control.  The doctor insisted that ACTH 
was the only therapy likely to be of any help with the multiple 
sclerosis, despite its adverse effects.  Another, oral, steroid was 
eventually substituted.

         22.  One day Paufler became semi-catatonic while sitting in his 
living room at home.  He was rushed to the hospital emergency room.  He 
nearly died.  Lab reports indicated, among other things, a nearly total 
lack of potassium in his body.  He was given massive injections of 
potassium in the emergency room and placed on an oral supplement.  
Paufler resolved to take no more steroids.

         23.  From time to time, prior to this point, Paufler had smoked 
marijuana socially with visiting friends, seek some relief from his 
misery in a temporary "high".  He now began smoking marijuana more often.  
After some weeks he found that he could stand and then walk a bit.  His 
doctor dismissed the idea that marijuana could be helpful with multiple 
sclerosis, and Paufler, himself, was skeptical at first.  He began 
discontinuing it for a while, then resuming.

         24.  Paufler found that when he did not smoke marijuana his 
condition worsened, he suffered more intense spasms more frequently.  
When he smoked marijuana, his condition would stabilize and then improve;
spasms were more controlled and less severe; he felt better; he regained 
control over his limbs and could walk totally unaided.  His vision, often 
blurred and unfocused, improved.  Eventually he began smoking marijuana 
on a daily basis.  He ventured outdoors.  He was soon walking half a 
block.  His eyesight returned to normal.

                                 - 46 -
<hr>
His central field blindness cleared up.  He could focus well enough to 
read again.  One evening he went out with his children and found he could 
kick a soccer ball again.

         25.  Paufler has smoked marijuana regularly since 1980.  Since 
that time his multiple sclerosis has been well controlled.  His doctor 
has been astonished at Paufler's recovery.  Paufler can now run.  He can 
stand on one foot with his eyes closed.  The contrast with his condition, 
several years ago, seems miraculous.  Smoking marijuana when Paufler 
feels an attack coming on shortens the attack.  Paufler's doctor has 
looked Paufler in the eye and told him to keep doing whatever it is he's 
doing because it works.  Paufler and his doctor are exploring the 
possibility of obtaining a compassionate IND to provide legal access to 
marijuana for Paufler.

         26.  Paufler learned in about 1980 of the success of one Sam 
Diana, a multiple sclerosis patient, in asserting the defense of "medical 
necessity" in court when charged with using or possessing marijuana.  He 
learned that doctors, researchers and other multiple sclerosis patients 
had supported Diana's position in the court proceeding.

         27.  Irwin Rosenfeld has been diagnosed as having Pseudo Pseudo 
Hypoparathyroidism.  This uncommon disease causes bone spurs to appear 
and grow all over the body.  Over the patient's lifetime hundreds of 
these spurs can grow, any one of which can become malignant at any time.  
The resulting cancer would spread quickly and the patient would die.

         28.  Even without development of a malignancy, the disease 
causes enormous pain.  The spurs press upon adjacent body tissue, nerves 
and organs.  In Rosenfeld's case, he could neither sit still nor lie 
down, nor could he walk,

                                 - 47 -
<hr>
without experiencing pain.  Working in his furniture store in Portsmouth, 
Virginia, Mr. Rosenfeld was on his feet moving furniture all day long.  
The lifting and walking caused serious problems as muscles and tissues 
rubbed over the spurs of bone.  He tore muscles and hemorrhaged almost 
daily.

         29.  Rosenfeld's symptoms first appeared about the age of ten.  
Various drugs were prescribed for him for pain relief.  He was taking 
extremely powerful narcotics.  By the age of 19 his therapy included 300 
mg. of Sopor (a powerful sleeping agent) and very high doses of Dilaudid.  
He was found to be allergic to barbiturates.  Taking massive doses of 
pain control drugs, as prescribed, made it very difficult for Rosenfeld 
to function normally.  If he took enough of them to control the pain, he 
could barely concentrate on his schoolwork.  By the time he reached his 
early twenties Rosenfeld's monthly drug intake was between 120 to 140 
Dilaudid tablets, 30 or more Sopor sleeping pills and dozens of muscle 
relaxants.

         30.  At college in Florida Rosenfeld was introduced to marijuana 
by classmates.  He experimented with it recreationally.  He never 
experienced a "high" or "buzz" or "floating sensation" from it.  One day 
he smoked marijuana while playing chess with a friend.  It had been very 
difficult for him to sit for more than five or ten minutes at a time 
because of tumors in the backs of his legs.  Suddenly he realized that, 
absorbed in his chess game, and smoking marijuana, he had remained 
sitting for over an hour - with no pain.  He experimented further and 
found that his pain was reduced whenever he smoked marijuana.

         31.  Rosenfeld told his doctor of his discovery.  The doctor 
opined that it was possible that the marijuana was relieving the pain.  
Something

                                 - 48 -
<hr>
certainly was - there was a drastic decrease in Rosenfeld's need for such 
drugs as Dilaudid and Demerol and for sleeping pills.  The quality of 
pain relief which followed his smoking of marijuana was superior to any 
he had experienced before.  As his dosages of powerful conventional drugs 
decreased, Rosenfeld became less withdrawn from the world, more able to 
interact and function.  So he has continued to the present time.

         32.  After some time Rosenfeld's doctor accepted the fact that 
the marijuana was therapeutically helpful to Rosenfeld and submitted an 
IND application to FDA to obtain supplies of it legally for Rosenfeld.  
The doctor has insisted, however, that he not be publicly identified.  
After some effort the IND application was granted.  Rosenfeld is 
receiving supplies of marijuana from NIDA.  Rosenfeld testified before a 
committee of the Virginia legislature in about 1979 in support of 
legislation to make marijuana available for therapeutic purposes in that 
State.

         33.  In 1969, at age 19, David Branstetter dove into the shallow 
end of a swimming pool and broke his neck.  He became a quadriplegic, 
losing control over the movement of his arms and legs.  After being 
hospitalized for 18 months he returned home.  Valium was prescribed for 
him to reduce the severe spasms associated with his condition.  He became 
mildly addicted to Valium.  Although it helped mask his spasms, it made 
Branstetter more withdrawn and less able to take care of himself.  He 
stopped taking Valium for fear of the consequences of long-term 
addiction.  His spasms then became uncontrollable, often becoming so bad 
they would throw him from his wheelchair.

         34.  In about 1973 Branstetter began smoking marijuana 
recreationally.  He discovered that his severe spasms stopped whenever he 
smoked marijuana.

                                 - 49 -
<hr>
Unlike Valium, which only masked his symptoms and caused him to feel 
drunk and out of control, marijuana brought his spasmodic condition under 
control without impairing his faculties.  When he was smoking marijuana 
regularly he was more active, alert and outgoing.

         35.  Marijuana controlled his spasms so well that Branstetter 
could go out with friends and he began to play billiards again.  The 
longer he smoked marijuana the more he was able to use his arms and 
hands.  Marijuana also improved his bladder control and bowel movements.

         36.  At times the illegal marijuana Branstetter was smoking 
became very expensive and sometimes was unavailable.  During periods when 
he did not have marijuana his spasms would return, preventing Branstetter 
from living a "normal" life.  He would begin to shake uncontrollably, his 
body would feel tense, and his muscles would spasm.

         37.  In 1979 Branstetter was arrested and convicted of 
possession of marijuana.  He was placed on probation for two years.  
During that period he continued smoking marijuana and truthfully reported 
this, and the reason for it, to his probation officer whenever asked 
about it.  No action was taken against Branstetter by the court or 
probation authorities because of his continuing use of marijuana, except 
once in the wake of his publicly testifying about it before the Missouri 
legislature.  Then, although adverse action was threatened by the judge, 
nothing was actually done.

         38.  In 1981 Branstetter and a friend, a paraplegic, 
participated in a research study testing the therapeutic effects of 
synthetic THC on spasticity.  Placed on the THC Branstetter found that it 
did help control his spasms but appeared to became less effective with 
repeated use.  Also, unlike marijuana,

                                 - 50 -
<hr>
synthetic THC had a powerful mind-altering effect he found annoying.  
When the study ended the researcher strongly suggested that Branstetter 
continue smoking marijuana to control his spasms.

         39.  None of Branstetter's doctors have told him to stop smoking 
marijuana while several, directly and indirectly, have encouraged him to 
continue.  Branstetter knows of almost 20 other patients, paraplegics, 
quadriplegics and multiple sclerosis sufferers, who smoke marijuana to 
control their spasticity.

         40.  In 1981 a State of Washington Superior Court judge, sitting 
without a jury, found Samuel D. Diana not guilty of the charge of 
unlawful possession of marijuana.  In so doing the judge upheld Diana's 
defense of medical necessity.  Diana had been a multiple sclerosis 
patient since at least 1973.  He testified that smoking marijuana 
relieved his symptoms of double vision, tremors, unsteady walk, impaired 
hearing, tendency to vomit in the mornings and stiffness in the joints of 
his hands and legs.

         41.  Among the witnesses was a physician who had examined 
defendant Diana before and after he had used marijuana.  This doctor 
testified that marijuana had been effective therapeutically for Diana, 
that other medication had proven ineffective for Diana and that, while 
marijuana may have some detrimental effects, Diana would receive more 
benefit than harm from smoking it.  The doctor was not aware of any other 
drug that would be as effective as marijuana for Mr. Diana.  Other 
witnesses included three persons afflicted with multiple sclerosis who 
testified in detail as to marijuana's beneficial effect on their illness.

         42.  In acquitting defendant Diana of unlawful possession of 
marijuana the trial judge found that the three requirements for the 
defense of medical necessity had been established, namely: defendant's 
reasonable belief that his

                                 - 51 -
<hr>
use of marijuana was necessary to minimize the effects of multiple 
sclerosis; the benefits derived from its use are greater than the harm 
sought to be prevented by the controlled substances law; and no drug is 
as effective as marijuana in minimizing the effects of the disease in the 
defendant.

         43.  Denis Petro, M.D., is a neurologist of broad experience, 
ranging from active practice in neurology to teaching the subject in 
medical school and employment by FDA as a medical officer reviewing IND's 
and NDA's.  He has also been employed by pharmaceutical companies and has 
served as a consultant to the State of New York.  He is well acquainted 
with the case histories of three patients who have successfully utilized 
marijuana to control severe spasticity when other, FDA-approved drugs 
failed to do so.  Dr. Petro knows of other cases of patients who, he 
has determined, have effectively used marijuana to control their 
spasticity.  He has heard reports of additional patients with multiple 
sclerosis, paraplegia and quadriplegia doing the same.  There are reports 
published in the literature known to Dr. Petro, over the period at least 
1970 - 1986, of clinical tests demonstrating that marijuana and THC are 
effective in controlling or reducing spasticity in patients.

         44.  Large numbers of paraplegic and quadriplegic patients, 
particularly in Veterans Hospitals, routinely smoke marijuana to reduce 
spasticity.  While this mode of treatment is illegal, it is generally 
tolerated, if not openly encouraged, by physicians in charge of such 
wards who accept this practice as being of benefit to their patients.  
There are many spinal cord injury patients in Veterans Hospitals.

         45.  Dr. Petro sought FDA approval to conduct research with 
spasticity patients using marijuana.  FDA refused but, for reasons 
unknown to him, allowed

him to make a study using synthetic THC.  He and colleagues made such a 
study.  They concluded that synthetic THC effected a significant 
reduction in spasticity among multiple sclerosis patients, but study 
participants who had also smoked marijuana reported consistently that 
marijuana was more effective.

         46.  Dr. Petro accepts marijuana as having a medical use in the 
treatment of spasticity in the United States.  If it were legally 
available and he was engaged in an active medical practice again, he 
would not hesitate to prescribe marijuana, when appropriate, to patients 
afflicted with uncontrollable spasticity.

         47.  Dr. Petro presented a paper to a meeting of the American 
Academy of Neurology.  The paper was accepted for presentation.  After he 
presented it Dr. Petro found that many of the neurologists present at 
this most prestigious meeting were in agreement with his acceptance of 
marijuana as having a medical use in the treatment of spasticity.

         48.  Dr. Andrew Weil, a general medicine practitioner in Tucson, 
Arizona, who also teaches at the University of Arizona College of 
Medicine, accepts marijuana as having a medical use in the treatment of 
spasticity.  In multiple sclerosis patients the muscles become tense and 
rigid because their nerve supply is interrupted.  Marijuana relieves this 
spasticity in many patients, he has found.  He would prescribe it to 
selected patients if it were legally available,

         49.  Dr. Lester B. Collins, III, a neurologist, then treating 
about 20 multiple sclerosis patients a year, seeing two or three new ones 
each year, stated in 1983 that he had no doubt that marijuana worked 
symptomatically for some multiple sclerosis patients.  He said that it 
does not alter the course of

                                 - 53 -
<hr>
the disease but it does relieve the symptoms of spasticity.

         50.  Dr. John P. Morgan, board certified in internal medicine, 
Professor of Medicine and Director of Pharmacology at CCNY Medical School 
in New York and Associate Professor of Medicine and Pharmacology at Mt. 
Sinai School of Medicine, accepts marijuana as having medical use in 
treatment in the United States.  If he were practicing medicine and 
marijuana were legally available he would prescribe it when indicated to 
patients with legitimate medical needs.


Discussion

     Based upon the rationale set out in pages 26 to 34, above, the 
administrative law judge concludes that, within the meaning of the Act, 
21 U.S.C.  812(b)(2)(B), marijuana "has a currently accepted medical use 
in treatment in the United States" for spasticity resulting from multiple 
sclerosis and other causes.  It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and 
capricious to find otherwise.  The facts set out above, uncontroverted by 
the Agency, establish beyond question that some doctors in the United 
States accept marijuana as helpful in such treatment for some patients.  
The record here shows that they constitute a significant minority of 
physicians.  Nothing more can reasonably be required.  That some doctors 
would have more studies and test results in hand before accepting 
marijuana's usefulness here is irrelevant.

     The same is true with respect to the hyperparathyroidism from which 
Irvin Rosenfeld suffers.  His disease is so rare, and so few physicians 
appear to be familiar with it, that acceptance by one doctor of marijuana 
as being useful in treating it ought to satisfy the requirement for a 
significant minority.  The Agency points to no evidence of record tending
to establish that marijuana is

                                - 54 -
<hr>
not accepted by doctors in connection with this most unusual ailment.  
Refusal to acknowledge acceptance by a significant minority, in light of 
the case history detailed in this record, would be unreasonable, 
arbitrary and capricious.

            ACCEPTED SAFETY FOR USE UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION

     With respect to whether or not there is "a lack of accepted safety 
for use of [marijuana] under medical supervision", the record shows the 
following facts to be uncontroverted.


Findings of Fact

          1.  Richard J. Gralla, M.D., an oncologist and Professor of 
Medicine who was an Agency witness, accepts that in treating cancer 
patients oncologists can use the cannabinoids with safety despite their 
side effects.

          2.  Andrew T. Weil, M.D., who now practices medicine in Tucson, 
Arizona and is on the faculty of the College of Medicine, University of 
Arizona, was a member of the first team of researchers to perform a 
Federal Government authorized study into the effects of marijuana on 
human subjects.  This team made its study in 1968.  These researchers 
determined that marijuana could be safely used under medical supervision.  
In the 20 years since then Dr. Weil has seen no information that would 
cause him to reconsider that conclusion.  There is no question in his 
mind but that marijuana is safe for use under appropriate medical 
supervision.

          3.  The most obvious concern when dealing with drug safety is 
the possibility of lethal effects.  Can the drug cause death?

          4.  Nearly all medicines have toxic, potentially lethal 
effects.  But marijuana is not such a substance.  There is no record in 
the extensive medical literature describing a proven, documented 
cannabis-induced fatality.

                                 - 56 -
<hr>
          5.  This is a remarkable statement. First, the record on 
marijuana encompasses 5,000 years of human experience.  Second, marijuana 
is now used daily by enormous numbers of people throughout the world.  
Estimates suggest that from twenty million to fifty million Americans 
routinely, albeit illegally, smoke marijuana without the benefit of 
direct medical supervision.  Yet, despite this long history of use and 
the extraordinarily high numbers of social smokers, there are simply no 
credible medical reports to suggest that consuming marijuana has caused a 
single death.

          6.  By contrast aspirin, a commonly used, over-the-counter 
medicine, causes hundreds of deaths each year.

          7.  Drugs used in medicine are routinely given what is called 
an LD-50.  The LD-50 rating indicates at what dosage fifty percent of 
test animals receiving a drug will die as a result of drug induced 
toxicity.  A number of researchers have attempted to determine 
marijuana's LD-50 rating in test animals, without success.  Simply 
stated, researchers have been unable to give animals enough marijuana to 
induce death.

          8.  At present it is estimated that marijuana's LD-50 is around 
1:20,000 or 1:40,000.  In layman terms this means that in order to induce 
death a marijuana smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as 
much marijuana as is contained in one marijuana cigarette.  NIDA-supplied 
marijuana cigarettes weigh approximately .9 grams.  A smoker would 
theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within 
about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.

          9.  In practical terms, marijuana cannot induce a lethal 
response as a result of drug-related toxicity.

                                 - 57 -
<hr>
         10.  Another common medical way to determine drug safety is 
called the therapeutic ratio.  This ratio defines the difference between 
a therapeutically effective dose and a dose which is capable of inducing 
adverse effects.

         11. A commonly used over-the-counter product like aspirin has a 
therapeutic ratio of around 1:20.  Two aspirins are the recommended dose 
for adult patients.  Twenty times this dose, forty aspirins, may cause a 
lethal reaction in some patients, and will almost certainly cause gross 
injury to the digestive system, including extensive internal bleeding.

         12.  The therapeutic ratio for prescribed drugs is commonly 
around 1:10 or lower.  Valium, a commonly used prescriptive drug, may 
cause very serious biological damage if patients use ten times the 
recommended (therapeutic) dose.

         13.  There are, of course, prescriptive drugs which have much 
lower therapeutic ratios.  Many of the drugs used to treat patients with 
cancer, glaucoma and multiple sclerosis are highly toxic.  The 
therapeutic ratio of some of the drugs used in antineoplastic therapies, 
for example, are regarded as extremely toxic poisons with therapeutic 
ratios that may fall below 1:1.5.  These drugs also have very low LD-50 
ratios and can result in toxic, even lethal reactions, while being 
properly employed.

         14.  By contrast, marijuana's therapeutic ratio, like its LD-50, 
is impossible to quantify because it is so high.

         15.  In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many 
foods we commonly consume.  For example, eating ten raw potatoes can 
result in a toxic response.  By comparison, it is physically impossible 
to eat enough marijuana to induce death.

         16.  Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest 
therapeutically

                                 - 58 -
<hr>
active substances known to man.  By any measure of rational analysis 
marijuana can be safely used within a supervised routine of medical care.

         17.  Some of the drugs most widely used in chemotherapy 
treatment of cancer have adverse effects as follows:

               Cisplatin, one of the most powerful chemo-
         therapeutic agents used on humans - may cause deafness;
         may lead to life-threatening kidney difficulties and
         kidney failure; adversely affects the body's immune
         system, suppressing the patient's ability to fight a
         host of common infections.

               Nitrogen Mustard, a drug used in therapy for
         Hodgkins disease - nauseates; so toxic to the skin
         that, if dropped on the skin, this chemical literally
         eats it away along with other tissues it contacts; if
         patient's intravenous lead slips during treatment and
         this drug gets on or under the skin the patient may
         suffer serious injury including temporary, and in
         extreme cases, permanent, loss of use of the arm.

               Procarbizine, also used for Hodgkins disease -
         has known psychogenic, i.e., emotional, effects.

               Cyoxin, also known as Cyclophosphanide -
         suppresses patient's immune system response; results
         in serious bone marrow depletion; studies indicate
         this drug may also cause other cancers, including
         cancers of the bladder.

               Adriamycan, has numerous adverse effects; is
         difficult to employ in long term therapies because it
         destroys the heart muscle.

While each of these agents has its particular adverse effects, as 
indicated above, they also cause a number of similar, disturbing adverse 
effects.  Most of these drugs cause hair loss.  Studies increasingly 
indicate all of these drugs may cause other forms of cancer.  Death due 
to kidney, heart or respiratory failure is a very real possibility with 
all of these agents and the margin for error is minimal.  Similarly, 
there is a danger of overdosing a patient weakened by his cancer.  Put 
simply, there is very great risk associated with the medical

                                 - 59 -
<hr>
use of these chemicals agents.  Despite these high risks, all of these 
drugs are considered "safe" for use under medical supervision and are 
regularly administered to patients on doctor's orders in the United 
States today.

         18.  There have been occasional instances of panic reaction in 
patients who have smoked marijuana.  These have occurred in marijuana-
naive persons, usually older persons, who are extremely anxious over the 
forthcoming chemotherapy and troubled over the illegality of their having 
obtained the marijuana.  Such persons have responded to simple person-to-
person communication with a doctor and have sustained no long term mental 
or physical damage.  If marijuana could be legally obtained, and 
administered in an open, medically-supervised session rather than 
surreptitiously, the few instances of such adverse reaction doubtless 
would be reduced in number and severity.

         19.  Other reported side effects of marijuana have been minimal.  
Sedation often results.  Sometimes mild euphoria is experienced.  Short 
periods of increased pulse rate and of dizziness are occasionally 
experienced.  Marijuana should not be used by persons anxious or 
depressed or psychotic or with certain other health problems.  Physicians 
could readily screen out such patients if marijuana were being employed 
as an agent under medical supervision.

         20.  All drugs have "side effects" and all drugs used in 
medicine for their therapeutic benefits have unwanted, unintended, 
sometimes adverse effects.

         21.  In medical treatment "safety" is a relative term.  A drug 
deemed "safe" for use in treating a life-threatening disease might be 
"unsafe" if prescribed for a patient with a minor ailment.  The concept 
of drug "safety" is relative.  Safety is measured against the 
consequences a patient would confront in the absence of therapy.  The 
determination of "safety" is made in terms of 

                                 - 60 -
<hr>
whether a drug's benefits outweigh its potential risks and the risks of 
permitting the disease to progress.

         22.  In the context of glaucoma therapy, it must be kept in mind 
that glaucoma, untreated, progressively destroys the optic nerve and 
results in eventual blindness.  The danger, then, to patients with 
glaucoma is an irretrievable loss of their sight.

         23.  Glaucoma is not a mortal disease, but a highly specific, 
selectively incapacitating condition.  Glaucoma assaults and destroys the 
patient's most evolved and critical sensory ability, his or her vision.  
The vast majority of patients afflicted with glaucoma are adults over the 
age of thirty.  The onset of blindness in middle age or later throws 
patients into a wholly alien world.  They can no longer do the work they 
once did.  They are unable to read a newspaper, drive a car, shop, walk 
freely and do all the myriad things sighted people take for granted.  
Without lengthy periods of retraining, adaptation and great effort these 
individuals often lose their sense of identity and ability to function.  
Those who are young enough or strong-willed enough will regain a sense of 
place, hold meaningful jobs, but many aspects of the life they once took 
for granted cannot be recaptured.  Other patients may never fully adjust 
to their new, uncertain circumstances.

         24.  Blindness is a very grave consequence.  Protecting patients 
from blindness is considered so important that, for ophthalmologists 
generally, it justifies the use of toxic medicines and uncertain surgical 
procedures which in other contexts might be considered "unsafe."  In 
practice, physicians often provide glaucoma patients with drugs which 
have many serious adverse effects.

         25.  There are only a limited number of drugs available for the

                                 - 61 -
<hr>
treatment of glaucoma.  All of these drugs produce adverse effects.  
While several government witnesses lightly touched on the side effects of 
these drugs, none provided a full or detailed description of their known 
adverse consequences.

         26.  The adverse physical consequences resulting from the 
chronic use of commonly employed glaucoma control drugs include a vast 
range of unintended complications from mild problems like drug induced 
fevers, skin rashes, headaches, anorexia, asthma, pulmonary difficulties, 
hypertension, hypotension and muscle cramps to truly serious, even life-
threatening complications including the formation of cataracts, stomach 
and intestinal ulcers, acute respiratory distress, increases and 
decreases in heart rate and pulse, disruption of heart function, chronic 
and acute renal disease, and bone marrow depletion.

         27.  Finally, each FDA-approved drug family used in glaucoma 
therapy is capable of producing a lethal response, even when properly 
prescribed and used.  Epinephrine can lead to elevated blood pressure 
which may result in stroke or heart attack.  Miotic drugs suppress 
respiration and can cause respiratory Paralysis.  Diuretic drugs so alter 
basic body chemistry they cause renal stones and may destroy the 
patient's kidneys or result in death due to heart failure.  Timolol and 
related beta-blocking agents, the most recently approved family of 
glaucoma control drugs, can trigger severe asthma attacks or cause death 
due to sudden cardiac arrhythmias often producing cardiac arrest.

         28.  Both of the FDA-approved drugs used in treating the 
symptoms of multiple sclerosis, Dantrium and Lioresal, while accepted as 
"safe" can, in fact, be very dangerous substances.  Dantrium or 
dantrolene sodium carries a boxed warning in the Physician's Desk 
Reference (PDR) because of its very high toxicity.  Patients using this 
drug run a very real risk of developing sympto-

                                 - 62 -
<hr>
matic hepatitis (fatal and nonfatal).  The list of sublethal toxic 
reactions also underscores just how dangerous Dantrium can be.  The PDR, 
in part, notes Dantrium commonly causes weakness, general malaise and 
fatigue and goes on to note the drug can also cause constipation, GI 
bleeding, anorexia, gastric irritation, abdominal cramps, speech 
disturbances, seizure, visual disturbances, diplopia, tachycardia, 
erratic blood pressure, mental confusion, clinical depression, renal 
disturbances, myalgia, feelings of suffocation and death due to liver 
failure.

         29.  The adverse effects associated with Lioresal baclofen are 
somewhat less severe, but include possibly lethal consequences, even when 
the drug is properly prescribed and taken as directed.  The range on 
sublethal toxic reactions is similar to those found with Dantrium.

         30.  Norman E, Zinberg, M.D., one of Dr. Weil's colleagues in 
the 1968 study mentioned in finding 2, above, accepts marijuana as being 
safe for use under medical supervision.  If it were available by 
prescription he would use it for appropriate patients.

         31.  Lester Grinspoon, M.D., practicing psychiatrist researcher 
and Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, accepts 
marijuana as safe for use under medical supervision.  He believes its 
safety is its greatest advantage as a medicine in appropriate cases.

         32.  Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D., a psychiatrist practicing in 
Berkley, California who treats substance abusers as inpatients and 
outpatients, accepts marijuana as safe for use under medical supervision.

         33.  Richard D. North, M.D., who has treated Robert Randall for 
glaucoma with marijuana for nine years, accepts marijuana as safe for use 
by his patient

                                 - 63 -
<hr>
under medical supervision.  Mr. Randall has smoked ten marijuana 
cigarettes a day during that period without any evidence of adverse 
mental or physical effects from it.

          34.  John C. Merritt, M.D., an expert in ophthalmology, who has 
treated Robert Randall and others with marijuana for glaucoma, accepts 
marijuana as being safe for use in such treatment.

         35.  Deborah B. Goldberg, M.D., formerly a researcher in 
oncology and now a practicing physician, having worked with many cancer 
patients, observed them, and heard many tell of smoking marijuana 
successfully to control emesis, accepts marijuana is proven to be an 
extremely safe anti-emetic agent.  When compared with the other, highly 
toxic chemical substances routinely prescribed to cancer patients, Dr. 
Goldberg accepts marijuana as clearly safe for use under medical 
supervision.  (See finding 17, above.)

         36.  Ivan Silverberg, M.D., board certified in oncology and 
practicing that specialty in the San Francisco area, has accepted 
marijuana as a safe anti-emetic when used under medical supervision.  
Although illegal, it is commonly used by patients in the San Francisco 
area with the knowledge and acquiescence of their doctors who readily 
accept it as being safe for such use.

         37.  It can be inferred that all of the doctors and other health 
care professionals referred to in the findings in Sections V, VI and VII, 
above, who tolerate or permit patients to self-administer illegal 
marijuana for therapeutic benefit, accept the substance as safe for use 
under medical supervision.

                                 - 64 -

Discussion

     The Act, at 21 U.S.C.  812(b)(1)(C), requires that marijuana be 
retained in Schedule I if "[t]here is a lack of accepted safety for use 
of [it] under medical supervision."  If there is no lack of such safety, 
if it is accepted that this substance can be used with safety under 
medical supervision, then it is unreasonable to keep it in Schedule I.

     Again we must ask - "accepted" by whom?  In the MDMA proceeding the 
Agency's first Final Rule decided that "accepted" here meant, as in the 
phrase "accepted medical use in treatment", that the FDA had accepted the 
substance pursuant to the provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.  
51 Fed. Reg. 36555 (1986).  The Court of Appeals held that this was 
error.  On remand, in its third Final Rule on MDMA, the Agency made the 
same ruling as before, relying essentially on the same findings, and on 
others of similar nature, just as it did with respect to "accepted 
medical use."  53 Fed. Reg. 5156 (1988).

     The administrative law judge finds himself constrained not to follow 
the rationale in that MDMA third Final Order for the same reasons as set 
out above in Section V with respect to "accepted medical use" in 
oncology.  See pages 30 to 33.  Briefly, the Agency was looking primarily 
at the results of scientific tests and studies rather than at what 
physicians had, in fact, accepted.  The Agency was wrongly basing its 
decision on a judgment as to whether or not doctors ought to have 
accepted the substance in question as safe for use under medical 
supervision.  The criteria the Agency applied in the MDMA third Final 
Rule are inappropriate.  The only proper question for the Agency here is: 
Have a significant minority of physicians accepted marijuana as safe for 
use under medical supervision?

                                 - 65 -
<hr>
     The gist of the Agency's case against recognizing marijuana's 
acceptance as safe is to assert that more studies, more tests are needed.  
The Agency has presented highly qualified and respected experts, 
researchers and others, who hold that view.  But, as demonstrated in the 
discussion in Section V above, it is unrealistic and unreasonable to 
require unanimity of opinion on the question confronting us.  For the 
reasons there indicated, acceptance by a significant minority of doctors 
is all that can reasonably be required.  This record makes it abundantly 
clear that such acceptance exists in the United States.

     Findings are made above with respect to the safety of medically 
supervised use of marijuana by glaucoma patients.  Those findings are 
relevant to the safety issue even though the administrative law judge 
does not find accepted use in treatment of glaucoma to have been shown.

     Based upon the facts established in this record and set out above 
one must reasonably conclude that there is accepted safety for use of 
marijuana under medical supervision.  To conclude otherwise, on this 
record, would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious.

                                 - 66 -

                                   IX.

                               CONCLUSION
                                  AND
                          RECOMMENDED DECISION

     Based upon the foregoing facts and reasoning, the administrative law 
judge concludes that the provisions of the Act permit and require the 
transfer of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II.  The Judge realizes
that strong emotions are aroused on both sides of any discussion 
concerning the use of marijuana.  Nonetheless it is essential for this 
Agency, and its Administrator, calmly and dispassionately to review the 
evidence of record, correctly apply the law, and act accordingly.

     Marijuana can be harmful.  Marijuana is abused.  But the same is 
true of dozens of drugs or substances which are listed in Schedule II so 
that they can be employed in treatment by physicians in proper cases, 
despite their abuse potential.

     Transferring marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II will not, of 
course, make it immediately available in pharmacies throughout the 
country for legitimate use in treatment.  Other government authorities, 
Federal and State, will doubtless have to act before that might occur.  
But this Agency is not charged with responsibility, or given authority, 
over the myriad other regulatory decisions that may be required before 
marijuana can actually be legally available.  This Agency is charged 
merely with determining the placement of marijuana pursuant to the 
provisions of the Act.  Under our system of laws the responsibilities of 
other regulatory bodies are the concerns of those bodies, not of this 
Agency,

     There are those who, in all sincerity, argue that the transfer of 
marijuana

                                 - 67 -
<hr>
to Schedule II will "send a signal" that marijuana is "OK" generally for 
recreational use.  This argument is specious.  It presents no valid 
reason for refraining from taking an action required by law in light of 
the evidence.  If marijuana should be placed in Schedule II, in obedience 
to the law, then that is where marijuana should be placed, regardless of 
misinterpretation of the placement by some.  The reasons for the 
placement can, and should, be clearly explained at the time the action is 
taken.  The fear of sending such a signal cannot be permitted to override 
the legitimate need, amply demonstrated in this record, of countless 
suffers for the relief marijuana can provide when prescribed by a 
physician in a legitimate case.

     The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has been 
accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very 
ill people, and doing so with safety under medical supervision.  It would 
be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for DEA to continue to stand 
between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance in light of 
the evidence in this record.

     The administrative law judge recommends that the Administrator 
conclude that the marijuana plant considered as a whole has a currently 
accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, that there is no 
lack of accepted safety for use of it under medical supervision and that 
it may lawfully be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II.  The judge 
recommends that the Administrator transfer marijuana from Schedule I to 
Schedule II.

                                   <b>-- Hiram Warren Johnson</b>
                                        <b>Senate speech, 1917</b>

                          <b>I. INTRODUCTION</b>

     Plaintiff Ralph Seeley, a lawyer, brought this action pro se, 

seeking a declaration that the placing of marijuana in &quot;Schedule I&quot; 

in RCW 69.50.204 is a violation of the liberties guaranteed by the 

Washington constitution.  The plaintiff has standing to sue because 

he is a cancer patient, facing ongoing treatment for his disease, 

who has a legitimate need for marijuana to relieve suffering, and 

cannot legally obtain it.

     The plaintiff contends that two sections of Article I of the 

Washington constitution should protect him from the withholding of a 

valuable therapeutic herb.  In brief:

Persons who need opium, cocaine, morphine, barbiturates or 

  amphetamines have the privilege of using the drugs and immunity 

  from arrest with a doctor's prescription; the plaintiff needs 

  cannabis in its vegetable state (marijuana), and has neither 

  privilege nor immunity available to him.  Article I  12, the 

  &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; clause, specifically prohibits such 

  arbitrary classification.

Article 1  32 states in full, &quot;A frequent recurrence to fundamental 

  principles is essential to the security of individual right and 

  the perpetuity of free government.&quot;  Prohibiting physicians from 

  providing needed medicine to sick people has created legal and 

  social consequences which should be changed as a matter of 

  fundamental principle.

     The parties agreed to the procedural course now undertaken -- 

to file for summary judgment with simultaneous briefs, with the 

losing party to seek direct review by the Supreme Court.


                             <b>II. FACTS</b>     

     <b>A. FACTS REGARDING THE PLAINTIFF'S MEDICAL HISTORY AND USE OF</b> 
        <b>MARIJUANA.</b>

     The plaintiff was diagnosed with chordoma, a rare form of bone 

cancer, in 1986.   He has undergone eight surgeries on his spine, 

two lung surgeries (including the removal of one lung), neutron 

radiation, electron radiation, and several bouts of chemotherapy.  

Declaration of Ernest Conrad, Exhibit A; Declaration of Ralph 

Seeley, Exhibit B.

     In the course of chemotherapy, the plaintiff became so 

violently ill that he considered discontinuing the treatment and 

allowing the disease to run its course.  At the suggestion of one of 

his physicians, and after discussion with other cancer patients, he 

smoked marijuana before the next injection of chemicals.  The result 

was overwhelming.  Without smoking marijuana, the plaintiff's 

suffering from chemotherapy included hours of agony ending with 

minutes of helplessly lying in his own vomit and excrement on the 

floor, unable to summon the energy to pull the &quot;nurse call&quot; cord 

inches away.  After smoking marijuana, the same regimen of 

chemotherapy resulted in a mildly uncomfortable hour followed by a 

restful night's sleep.  Declaration of Seeley, Exhibit B.

     With synthetic THC (Marinol or dronabinol) and other 

antiemetics, the relief was not as effective, and the side effects 

were much more troubling.  There are three principal problems with 

legal, synthetic THC as opposed to illegal, vegetable-state 

marijuana:

The synthetic drug takes a long time to take effect -- from two to 

  four hours.  Smoking marijuana brings results in five to ten 

  minutes.

The synthetic drug dose is impossible to &quot;titrate,&quot; or adjust, and 

  the lowest dosage supplied results in a more debilitating &quot;high&quot; 

  than smoking marijuana.

The &quot;high&quot; from the legal synthetic lasts about 14 hours, while it 

  is typically gone in four to five hours with smoked marijuana.

Declaration of Seeley, Exhibit B; Declaration of Grinspoon, Exhibit 

C.

     To stay legal, then, a patient must take the synthetic drug at 

least two hours before the chemotherapy; then plan on at least 14 

hours of being &quot;out of commission.&quot;  If you don't take the drug two 

hours before the chemotherapy, the violent nausea takes over.  Id.

     In the two to four days following weekly chemotherapy, the 

plaintiff would undergo unpredictable onsets of violent nausea and 

diarrhea. Trying to take the prescribed synthetic THC was futile, 

because the tablets were vomited up whole.  Declaration of Seeley, 

Exhibit B.

     It cannot be over-emphasized that chemotherapy-induced nausea 

is not &quot;an upset tummy.&quot;  It is violent, unrelenting retching and 

gagging, often accompanied by an uncontrollable release of bowel 

control.  The plaintiff underwent adriamycin/cysplatin chemotherapy 

at the University of Washington, one of the most sophisticated 

cancer-care facilities in the nation.  Yet with legal THC, he still 

wound up on the treatment room floor, as described above.

     The non-medical realities for the plaintiff during chemotherapy 

were these:

During his first bout of chemotherapy, he used legal antiemetics.  

  He was in the second  semester of the first year of law school, 

  and wrote barely passing grades.

During the second bout of chemotherapy (same chemo regimen), he 

  smoked marijuana instead of or in addition to taking prescribed 

  medications.  The chemotherapy lasted most of the law-school 

  semester, and he smoked marijuana virtually every day.  He made 

  the Dean's List, as well as winning an AmJur award for what his 

  professor stated was &quot;the best evidence exam I have ever seen.&quot;

During the first chemotherapy, the THC tablets cost 84 cents each.  

  Later, the cost went to more than $5 each, from the same 

  pharmacy.  (The plaintiff will produce the pharmacy vials at oral 

  argument.)  This cost increase of ___ percent coincides with the 

  timing of the end of a federal program for supplying sick people 

  with vegetable-state marijuana.  The plaintiff paid nothing for 

  the vegetable-state marijuana, which was donated.  (Vegetable-

  state marijuana is typically free to sick people, since it costs 

  virtually nothing -- other than risk of imprisonment -- to 

  produce, and numerous people grow it for the exclusive use of 

  sick people.)


     <b>B. FACTS REGARDING THE LEGAL HISTORY OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA.</b>

              <b>1. Marijuana as medicine, pre-prohibition.</b>

     As summarized from Grinspoon, Marijuana, the Forbidden 

Medicine, pp 1-23 (attached to Declaration of Grinspoon, Exhibit C):

     Cannabis has been used as a soporific (sleep-inducement), 

analgesic (pain reduction), for constipation, to relieve headaches 

and nausea and numerous other health problems in various cultures 

throughout the world for more than 5,000 years.  In all those 

centuries, there has never been a death recorded as a result of 

overdose, making it one of the safest, if not the safest chemicals 

ever ingested in human beings for healing purposes.

     The first Western physician to take notice of the plant was an 

English doctor who observed its use in India, and concluded that it 

was safe and helpful.  In a report published in 11839, he wrote that 

it was an effective analgesic, and that its muscle relaxant 

properties made it &quot;an anticonvulsive remedy of the greatest value.&quot;

     Cannabis was considered a routine part of the physician's 

pharmacopea in this country and others in the 18th and 19th 

centuries; it was even prescribed for Queen Victoria by her court 

physician.  It was listed in the United States Dispensatory in 1854.  

Commercial cannabis preparations could be bought in drug stores.

     Numerous favorable reports on the drug were published in the 

second half of the last century, remarking on how the drug differed 

from narcotics such as opium by not causing debilitating side 

effects such as loss of appetite and constipation, not causing 

addiction, and not requiring higher doses to be effective over time.

     Several developments led to the discontinuance of marijuana as 

medicine.

     First, the advent of the hypodermic syringe led to quicker 

results in pain relief by injection of narcotics -- not possible 

with cannabis because it is not soluble in water.  Next, the 

invention of synthetic drugs such as aspirin, chloral hydrate and 

barbiturates in the early part of this century had two results: 

First, as a plant, marijuana/hemp can't be patented, so profits 

drove pharmaceutical companies toward synthetics; and second, the 

dose could not be determined as specifically as with something such 

as an aspirin tablet.  (It should be noted that between 500 and 

1,000 people die of aspirin-induced bleeding every year in America, 

and barbiturates are, of course, even more dangerous.  Thus, in 

hindsight, we may question the wisdom of replacing cannabis with 

synthetics.)

     Thus, when Congress was considering the Marijuana Tax Act of 

1937, few voices in the medical community were raised in protest, 

because it appeared that no problems would be created; the act was 

aimed at recreational users.  The film Reefer Madness may be a joke 

to sophisticated people today, but it was a genuine effort on the 

part of the government to sway the public about &quot;dangerous and 

addictive&quot; marijuana at the time.

     The effect of the Act was to make obtaining marijuana for 

medicinal use so administratively burdensome that its use fell off 

to virtually nonexistent, and the drug was removed from the United 

States Pharmacopoeia and National Formulary in 1941.

              <b>2. Marijuana as medicine, post-prohibition.</b>

     Two social forces converged in the 1960s which have led to 

reconsideration of marijuana as medicine.  One was the &quot;coming out 

of the closet&quot; of recreational marijuana users, which led to the 

discovery by some ill, recreational users that smoking it helped 

more and cost less than prescribed medicines.  This led to a fund of 

&quot;anecdotal evidence&quot; that marijuana was effective in the treatment 

of glaucoma and spasticity from diseases such as multiple sclerosis.  

The other social force was the advent of chemotherapy for the 

attempted cure of cancer.  (Since the plaintiff has standing as a 

cancer patient, this brief will primarily deal with that aspect of 

the issue.)

     Chemotherapy is, in a word, poison.  Nurses who administer the 

chemicals wear protective clothing, face shields, and doubled rubber 

gloves, then inject the chemical directly into the patient's blood.  

Declaration of Seeley, Exhibit B.

     The concept of the treatment (roughly the same as radiation) is 

that the poison kills faster-dividing cells before it kills 

normally-growing cells.  Since tumors are virtually defined by their 

characteristic runaway, uncontrolled growth, theoretically an amount 

of poison can be administered which kills the tumor but not the 

&quot;host organism&quot; (in this case, the plaintiff).  The patient can only 

withstand a given amount of the therapy before dying of the cure, 

and in the process, the patient gets very sick, as described above, 

and tends to lose appetite and the ability to hold down food and 

digest it just when doing so to maintain strength and fight off the 

effects of the poison is most critical.

     A study by the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of 

Sciences released in 1981 noted the potential for therapeutic use 

and recommended further research:

       Until 10 or 15 years ago, there was virtually no 
       systematic, rigorously controlled research on the human 
       health-related effects of marijuana and its major 
       constituents.  Even now, when standardized marijuana and 
       pure synthetic cannabinoids are available for experimental 
       studies, and good qualitative methods exist. . .well-
       designed studies on human beings are relatively few.

                             * * *

       Our major recommendation is that there be a greatly 
       intensified and more comprehensive program of research into 
       the effects of marijuana on the health of the American 
       people.

&quot;Marijuana and Health,&quot; U.S. Institute of Medicine, Washington D.C., 

prepared for National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD, Dec. 1981, 

pages 4-5.

     Despite such recommendations by such a prestigious body of 

scientists, little research has been done, and the federal 

government has erected one roadblock after another to prevent the 

gathering of legitimate, scientific evidence, discussed further 

below.

     From the scientific studies available despite the efforts of 

the federal government, smoked marijuana has been shown to be an 

extremely effective and inexpensive remedy to counter the truly 

horrific effects of undergoing cancer chemotherapy.  Affidavit of 

Grinspoon, Exhibit C.  It is, however, illegal.


              <b>3. State statutory law.</b>

     Washington adopted the Uniform Controlled Substances Act in 

1971, under which drugs are listed in &quot;schedules,&quot; allegedly 

depending upon their therapeutic value and the potential safety.  

RCW 69.50.  The &quot;scheduling&quot; of the drugs is allegedly done by the 

Board of Pharmacy.  However, this is largely a fiction, since the 

schedules simply follow the federal model, as provided under RCW 

69.50.201(a)(2); 201(e).  If any drug has been scheduled differently 

in Washington than by the federal government, it remains mysterious 

to this plaintiff as to what that drug might be.

     Marijuana is listed as a &quot;Schedule I&quot; drug, meaning that (1) it 

has no currently accepted therapeutic use, (2) has a high potential 

for abuse, and (3) is not safe to use under medical supervision.  

RCW 69.50.203.  (It is listed for some mysterious reason as a 

&quot;&quot;hallucinogenic substance.&quot; RCW 69.50.204(c)(14)).  Synthetic THC, 

amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, morphine and opium are 

Schedule II drugs, meaning they have &quot;high potential for abuse,&quot; 

&quot;currently accepted medical use,&quot;, and &quot;the abuse of the substance 

may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.&quot;   RCW 

69.50.205, 206.  Barbiturates are Schedule III drugs.  RCW 

69.50.208.  In simple terms, doctors may prescribe synthetic THC, 

cocaine, morphine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, barbiturates and 

opium, but may not prescribe marijuana.

     Numerous states, including Washington, enacted legislation to 

provide marijuana to medically certified patients as a combination 

of experimental and compassionate legislation.  The Washington 

Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research Act became law in 1979 

(RCW 69.51), stating

       The legislature finds that recent research has shown that 
       the use of marijuana may alleviate the nausea and ill 
       effects of cancer chemotherapy and glaucoma.  The 
       legislature further finds that there is a need for further 
       research and experimentation regarding the use of marijuana 
       under strictly controlled circumstances. 

     The statute created a board of physicians to administer the 

program, in conjunction with federal agencies.  It was amended in 

1989 for &quot;housekeeping&quot; reasons (changing &quot;department&quot; to &quot;board&quot; 

and so forth), but long before, in 1981, for reasons that defy 

explanation on the surface, the legislature killed the program by 

not funding it.  Exhibit D, letter to plaintiff from Donald 

Williams, Executive Director, Board of Pharmacy.

     The alleged reason is that the research proved that THC was 

effective, and THC was synthesized and marketed as dronabinol or 

Marinol, therefore no further need for vegetable-state &quot;smokeable&quot; 

marijuana was required.

     For reasons set forth in Section A above, and in the 

Declaration of Grinspoon, Exhibit C, the contention is absurd.


               <b>4. State case law.</b>

     When Samuel Diana was arrested in 1977 for possession of a 

small amount of marijuana, he argued that it helped him cope with 

his multiple sclerosis better than prescribed medications.  The 

Court of Appeals held that necessity is always a potential defense 

to a crime, and remanded the case for determination, by a 

preponderance of the evidence, 

whether (1) the defendant reasonably believed his use of marijuana 

was necessary to minimize the effects of his disease; (2) whether 

the benefits derived from the drug's use are greater than the harm 

sought to be prevented by the controlled substance law; and (3) that 

no other drug is as effective in minimizing the effects of the 

disease. State v. Diana, 24 Wn. App. 908, 604 P.2d 1312 (1979). 

     With the current state of the literature on the subject, 

(especially since the release of the report of the DEA's Chief 

Administrative Law Judge in 1988, discussed further below), any 

person with glaucoma, multiple sclerosis (or other spasticity 

problems), chemotherapy-induced nausea or the AIDS &quot;wasting 

syndrome&quot; has no problem whatsoever meeting the first and third of 

those, leaving judges only to grapple with the issues of relative 

harm.  The result is that described in the Declaration of Andrew 

Subin, Exhibit E: Persons who need cannabis for medicinal purposes 

end up using it quasi-legally, after being arrested, posting bail, 

paying an attorney, and having their supply confiscated and not 

returned.  See also, State v. Cole, 74 Wn. App. 571, ___ P. 2d ___ 

(1994), in which (1) Division II specifically adopted the legal 

reasoning of Division III in State v. Diana, (2) the court held that 

a marijuana user's own testimony is more than a &quot;scintilla&quot; of 

evidence, and requires the issue of his reasonableness in using the 

drug to go to the jury, and (3) in the &quot;facts&quot; section of the 

opinion, it is established that a superior court judge stated, &quot;I 

hope they get you a prescription for marijuana if that's the only 

thing that works. . .[y]ou cannot in the future grow marijuana for 

your own consumption without a prescription.&quot;  Cole at 573.  This 

demonstrates the sort of misunderstanding among judges exemplified 

in the Declaration of Subin, Exhibit E, and which results in 

unintentional but real injustice on sick and helpless people.      

     This bizarre state of affairs is a keystone to the legal 

arguments below concerning both the privileges and immunities clause 

and the &quot;frequent recurrence to fundamental principles.&quot;


              <b>5. The federal farce.</b>

     The history of medical marijuana and federal law over the past 

three decades has resulted in untold unnecessary suffering among 

some of society's most sick and helpless individuals and their 

families; has diminished respect for the rule of law; and has 

resulted in appointed bureaucrats corrupting the system Congress set 

in place.

     The suborning of the rule of law to the hysteria of the &quot;war on 

drugs&quot; reads like Franz Kafka interpreting  &quot;Through the Looking 

Glass.&quot;  It goes approximately like this:

1972: The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws 
  (NORML) petitioned the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs 
  (precursor to the DEA) to reclassify medical marijuana.  The 
  agency refused to act on the petition.  NORML appealed to the 
  U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit.

1974: The court held that the agency's position had no merit, and 
  that the petition should be processed.  NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 
  F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

1975: The DEA (replacing the BNDD) dismissed the petition without 
  hearing testimony.  NORML appealed.

1977: The Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal, criticizing the 
  DEA for not providing scientific and medical evaluations as 
  required by law, which were to be provided by the Department of 
  Health, Education and Welfare (HEW).  NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735 
  (DC Cir. 1977).

1979: Unreasonable delays resulted in NORML filing motions to 
  compel, against both DEA and HEW.  Facing sanctions, HEW produced 
  a response.  DEA then dismissed the petition once again with no 
  hearings.  NORML appealed again.

1980: The Court of Appeals for the third time reprimanded the DEA 
  and affirmed NORML's right to a &quot;full and fair&quot; hearing. 

1981: NORML filed another motion to compel.  Within three days the 
  agencies announced the approval of synthetic THC 
  (Marinol/dronabinol), and promised a &quot;legislative type hearing&quot; 
  would be forthcoming.

       &#149;1982: With no hearing yet held, NORML filed yet another 
       motion to compel.  The Court of Appeals issued a Mandatory 
       Progression Order requiring the DEA and HEW to provide 
       them with 90-day progress notes.

1986: Hearing procedures were finally set.

1987: Written affidavits, evidence and exhibits filed.  Hearings 
  were held in New Orleans and San Francisco.

1988: Further evidentiary hearings were held in Washington, D.C.  
  Oral arguments were held before the DEA's Chief Administrative 
  Law Judge, Francis L. Young.  In September, Judge Young issued 
  the 68-page &quot;Opinion And Recommended Ruling, Findings Of Fact, 
  Conclusion Of Law And Decision Of Administrative Law Judge In The 
  Matter Of Marijuana Rescheduling Petition, Docket No. 86-22, U.S. 
  Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration.&quot;  
  (Hereinafter, &quot;Young Opinion.&quot;) Judge Young concluded:

       The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana 
       has been accepted  as capable of relieving the distress of 
       great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety 
       under medical supervision.  It would be unreasonable, 
       arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to continue to stand 
       between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance 
       in light of the evidence in this record.

  Young Opinion, page 68.  Judge Young recommended unequivocally 
  that marijuana be rescheduled as a Schedule II therapeutic drug.  
  Id.

1989: The head bureaucrat at the DEA rejected Judge Young's 
  recommendation and refused to reclassify marijuana, 
  characterizing its medical use as &quot;a cruel and dangerous hoax.&quot;  
  54 Federal Register 53767-53785, Dec. 29, 1989, p. 53784.  NORML 
  and the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics immediately appealed.

1991: The Court remanded the case to the DEA, noting the circularity 
  of the alleged logic: The DEA administrator refused to reschedule 
  the drug because, inter alia, it did not meet the requirement for 
  &quot;general availability of the substance&quot; and &quot;recognition of its 
  clinical use in generally accepted pharmacopoeia, medical 
  references, journals and textbooks,&quot; and for &quot;recognition and use 
  of the substance by a substantial segment of the medical 
  practitioners in the United States.&quot;  The court pointed out the 
  impossibility of showing that a drug enjoys &quot;availability&quot; or 
  &quot;use&quot; when it is illegal for doctors to obtain it by virtue of it 
  being a Schedule I drug.  Likewise, the drug is not going to show 
  up in any manual or pharmacopoeia if it is illegal to prescribe 
  and illegal to possess.  Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. 
  DEA, 930 F.2d 936 (DC Cir. 1991).

1992: DEA head bureaucrat Robert Bonner issued a new Denial of 
  Petition leaving out the circular logic, but asserting boldly and 
  in direct contradiction of his Chief Administrative Law Judge's 
  opinion, that his response was based on common sense:

       Smoking causes lung cancer and other deadly diseases.  
       Americans take their medicines in pills, solutions, sprays, 
       shots, drops, creams and sometimes suppositories, but never 
       by smoking.

  Final Rule, Denial of Petition for Marijuana Rescheduling, March 
  18, 1992.

     In summary: Congress created an agency with the power to 

&quot;schedule&quot; drugs and to change the scheduling as new information 

became available; the agency refused to follow the mandates of 

Congress by investigating new information until forced by citizens 

to do so through court action over a span of two decades; the 

recommendation to make the change based on research and information 

was ignored by a bureaucrat relying on his own belief, superstition, 

or other imponderable reality.

     During most of the above-described decades, the federal 

government had in place a program by which some qualified sick 

people could obtain marijuana on a compassionate/experimental basis.  

It was discontinued, and no new applicants are permitted to obtain 

the drug.

1995 - The final irony:

     Through the decades, the feds have been citing a &quot;lack of 

scientific evidence,&quot; especially since the approval of synthetic THC 

-- i.e., &quot;there is no scientific evidence that the benefits of 

smoked marijuana are superior to those of synthetic THC.&quot;  (This 

Court may expect virtual litany of such nonsense from opposing 

counsel as these briefs are written and filed.)

     Dr. Donald Abrams of the University of California San Francisco 

spent three years obtaining the approval of the Food and Drug 

Administration for a study on that exact issue, regarding the effect 

of the two regimens (smoked versus oral) on the AIDS &quot;wasting 

syndrome.&quot;  In April of this year, the federal government rejected 

the proposal by refusing to supply the marijuana for the experiment.  

Affidavit of Doblin, Exhibit F.

     Thus, the government contends that the prohibition of marijuana 

as medicine is justified based on lack of scientific evidence, while 

prohibiting the gathering of scientific evidence. This circular and 

cynical manipulation of logic and legal argument at the expense of 

suffering and helpless people is another cornerstone of the 

&quot;fundamental principles&quot; argument set forth below.


                    <b>III. LAW AND LEGAL ARGUMENT</b>

     The plaintiff is petitioning this Court for equitable relief, 

by way of a declaration that his right to be free of suffering is 

being unreasonably withheld in violation of the &quot;privileges and 

immunities&quot; clause of the Washington Constitution, the &quot;frequent 

recurrence to fundamental principles&quot; clause, or both.

     The Court's power to issue such a declaration is set forth in 

Article 4,  6 of the Constitution of the State of Washington, and 

RCW 7.24, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.


     <b>A. THE WASHINGTON CONSTITUTION CONTAINS SAFEGUARDS TO</b>
        <b>INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY NOT FOUND IN THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.</b>

     It is well-established law that the U.S. Constitution's Bill of 

Rights, tacked on as an afterthought years after the Constitution 

itself was ratified, protects individual liberty to a lesser extent 

than Washington's constitution, in which the &quot;Declaration of rights&quot; 

is the first section.  Article I  1 states unequivocally that

       All political power is inherent in the people, and 
       governments. . .are established to protect and maintain 
       individual rights.

     The Supreme Court of Washington has held that even where the 

language of the two constitutions is similar, greater protection may 

be found under the state's constitution.  State v. Gunwall, 106 

Wn.2d 54, 720 P.2d 808 (1986).

     The plaintiff asks no more than to have this Court protect his 

individual right to be free of needless physical suffering, now 

being caused by his own government.


     <b>B. THE PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT UNDER</b> 
        <b>ARTICLE 1  12 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF</b> 
        <b>WASHINGTON, WHICH PROHIBITS SPECIAL PRIVILEGES AND</b> 
        <b>IMMUNITIES.</b>

               <b>1. Washington's &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; clause is</b> 
          <b>entitled to a more liberal interpretation to protect</b> 
          <b>individual rights than the federal constitution's</b> 
          <b>counterpart.</b>

     The &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; clause of the state's 

constitution is analyzed in the same manner as the &quot;equal 

protection&quot; clause of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 

State v. Smith, 117 Wn.2d 263, 814 P.2d 652 (1991).  That three-

prong analysis involves &quot;levels of scrutiny&quot; which are typically 

determinative of outcome, outlined in Smith at pages 277-79:

&quot;Strict scrutiny&quot; is required when a statute affects a &quot;suspect 

  class or a fundamental right.&quot;  A law may be upheld only if it is 

  &quot;necessary to accomplish a compelling state interest.&quot;

&quot;Heightened&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; scrutiny typically applies to gender-

  based classifications, but has been held to apply when the 

  challenged law affects both an important right(such as liberty) 

  and a semi-suspect class not accountable for its status (such as 

  the poor).  The test is that the law must be seen as &quot;furthering 

  a substantial interest of the state.&quot;

Minimal scrutiny is applied absent any reason for applying the 

  higher levels.  The test is whether a &quot;rational relationship&quot; 

  exists between the challenged classification and a &quot;legitimate 

  state interest.&quot;  The classification must be &quot;purely arbitrary&quot; 

  to overcome the presumption of constitutionality.

     In State v. Gunwall, supra., the Washington Supreme Court set 

out what have become known as &quot;the Gunwall factors,&quot; six areas of 

analysis required to be raised and briefed before the state's 

Supreme Court will consider invoking higher standards of personal 

liberty protection under the state constitution, compared to that 

provided by the U.S. Constitution. 

     In State v. Smith, supra, Justice Utter's concurring opinion 

provided a complete analysis of the state's privileges and 

immunities clause as contrasted to the 14th Amendment analysis 

above, and concluded that all six Gunwall factors were met, 

requiring an independent analysis to determine whether a challenged 

law violates Article 1,  12.  While the majority rejected his 

analysis based on Oregon constitutional analysis (our privileges and 

immunities clause was derived from Oregon's), there was no statement 

by the majority that Washington's privileges and immunities clause 

does not provide a higher level of protection for individual rights 

than the 14th Amendment, only that &quot;several recent decisions hold[] 

that the privileges and immunities clause and the equal protection 

clause are substantially identical and considered by this court as 

one issue.  We decline to interpret Const. art 1  12 independently 

of the Fourteenth Amendment in this decision as well.&quot;

     The plaintiff adopts Justice Utter's analysis by incorporation, 

and has attached a copy of the opinion for the convenience of the 

Court, as Exhibit G.</pre>

<pre>               <b>2. Under any analysis or &quot;level of scrutiny,&quot; the</b> 
          <b>plaintiff should prevail.</b>

     The &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; clause couldn't be more 

straightforward:

       No law shall be passed granting to any citizen, class of 
       citizens, or corporation other than municipal, privileges 
       or immunities which upon the same terms shall not equally 
       belong to all citizens, or corporations.

Wash. Const. art. 1  12.

     The plaintiff's situation regarding medicinal marijuana may be 

phrased in several ways which invoke the clause:

The plaintiff is denied the privilege of ending his suffering by the 

  use of a therapeutic drug while others are granted the privilege 

  of ending their suffering with access to far more harmful and 

  addictive drugs, such as morphine, cocaine, amphetamines, 

  barbiturates and opium.  Additionally, patients who need THC and 

  may absorb it effectively through their gastro-intestinal tract 

  have the privilege of the relief of their suffering, while the 

  plaintiff, whose GI tract is not functioning when he needs THC, 

  is denied the privilege.

Other citizens are granted immunity from arrest for possession of 

  therapeutic but potentially harmful drugs by virtue of 

  prescriptions, while the plaintiff is denied that immunity.

     Whatever &quot;level of scrutiny&quot; the Court deems appropriate, the 

plaintiff's right to be free of discrimination by his own government 

is being violated, in that the plaintiff is being made to suffer 

physically for reasons which serve no legitimate government purpose.

<b>THE DISCRIMINATION INVOLVES A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND IS ENTITLED TO</b> 
  <b>STRICT SCRUTINY.</b>

     As set forth in State v. Smith, supra, if government 

discrimination or classification involves a &quot;fundamental right,&quot; the 

courts must apply &quot;strict scrutiny,&quot; and uphold the classification 

only if it is &quot;necessary to accomplish a compelling state interest.&quot;  

Id.  The Washington Supreme Court has found that a physician has a 

fundamental right to freely practice medicine.  Bering v. Share, 106 

Wn.2d 212, 721 P.2d 918 (1986).  Clearly, it is no stretch to state 

the corollary -- that a patient has a fundamental right to the aid 

of his physician to relieve suffering.  In any event, the court in 

Bering held that the state has a &quot;substantial interest in ensuring 

its citizens unimpeded access to necessary medical care.&quot;  Id. at 

225.  That decision dealt with access to abortions; it is difficult 

for the plaintiff to see how that might be more &quot;necessary&quot; than 

ending the suffering of chemotherapy-induced, uncontrolled nausea 

and diarrhea.

     If the court finds that a fundamental right is involved and 

applies strict scrutiny, the state must justify maintaining 

marijuana in Schedule I as &quot;necessary to accomplish a compelling 

state interest.&quot;  Frankly, the plaintiff is at a loss to anticipate 

what sort of argument the state might put forward, if the attorneys 

involved intend to keep straight faces while addressing the Court.

     What is the &quot;compelling state interest&quot; in having the plaintiff 

lying on the floor retching and defecating on himself when he could 

be sleeping peacefully?  What &quot;compelling state interest&quot; justifies 

forcing the plaintiff to endure 14-hour &quot;highs&quot; in an attempt to 

relieve his suffering with synthetics?  What is the &quot;compelling 

state interest&quot; to force the plaintiff to pay $5 per THC tablet, 

many of which disappear down the toilet undissolved?

     Or is the &quot;compelling state interest&quot; the larger one of 

controlling marijuana as a recreational drug?  If so, why is it not 

&quot;necessary&quot; to place cocaine, opium, morphine, barbiturates, and 

amphetamines also in Schedule I?  Note that the penalty for 

manufacture or possession with intent to deliver a Schedule I or II 

drug is exactly the same. RCW 69.50.401.  Clearly, the legislature 

attaches no symbolic or exemplary difference between the two crimes.  

Thus, any contention by the Attorney General that placing marijuana 

in Schedule II and permitting its prescriptive, medicinal use will 

&quot;send a signal&quot; that recreational use of the drug is condoned should 

be given the merit it deserves -- none.

     In short, the classification of marijuana in Schedule I 

violates a fundamental right of the plaintiff, and the state cannot 

show a necessary reason for the classification that accomplishes a 

compelling state interest.  Therefore, the plaintiff's motion for 

declaratory relief should be granted.

<b>IF THE COURT DOES NOT FIND THAT A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT HAS BEEN</b> 
  <b>VIOLATED, THE LAW SHOULD STILL BE STRUCK DOWN UNDER &quot;INTERMEDIATE</b> 
  <b>SCRUTINY.&quot;</b>

     &quot;Heightened&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; scrutiny should apply even if 

&quot;strict scrutiny&quot; does not, because the classification involves an 

&quot;important right,&quot; and because the plaintiff is in a class for which 

he cannot be held accountable -- he did not choose to be a cancer 

patient, or to have his physician place him on chemotherapy in an 

attempt to save his life.  State v. Smith, supra.

     The test is that the law must be seen as &quot;furthering a 

substantial interest of the state.&quot;  As analyzed above, no state 

interest, substantial or otherwise, is not equally well served by 

placing marijuana in Schedule II.

<b>EVEN UNDER MINIMAL SCRUTINY, THE PLAINTIFF MUST PREVAIL, BECAUSE THE</b> 
  <b>CLASSIFICATION IS PURELY ARBITRARY.</b>

     Absent strict or heightened scrutiny, the test is whether a 

&quot;rational relationship&quot; exists between the challenged classification 

and a legitimate state interest.  What is the &quot;legitimate&quot; state 

interest in denying an end to the plaintiff's physical suffering?

     The classification must be &quot;purely arbitrary&quot; to overcome the 

presumption of constitutionality.  State v. Smith, supra at 279.  In 

fact, the classification is purely arbitrary.  As stated by Judge 

Young after taking hundreds of hours of testimony, reviewing 

thousands of pages of documents, and issuing a 68-page report:

       It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for the 
       DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the 
       benefits of this substance [marijuana] in light of the 
       evidence in this record.

Judge Young's report, supra at 68 (emphasis added).

     Thus, even under the &quot;minimal scrutiny&quot; test, the state can 

show no rational relationship between the classification and a 

legitimate state interest, and this court should find that the 

classification is purely arbitrary, and grant the declaratory relief 

requested.


     <b>C. THE PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO THE RELIEF REQUESTED UNDER</b> 
        <b>ARTICLE I  32, THE &quot;FREQUENT RECURRENCE TO FUNDAMENTAL</b> 
        <b>PRINCIPLES&quot; CLAUSE OF THE WASHINGTON CONSTITUTION.</b>

               <b>1. Gunwall factors analyzed.</b>

     The &quot;Gunwall factors&quot; have come to be, in Gunwall's progeny, 

required analysis and briefing at the superior court level in order 

for the Supreme Court to consider whether personal liberties are 

protected to a greater extent by the state's constitution, compared 

to the U.S. Constitution.  See, e.g., State v. Wethered, 110 Wn.2d 

466, 472, 755 P.2d 787 (1988); In re Mota, 114 Wn.2d 465, 472, 788 

P.2d 538 (1990).  The plaintiff adopted Justice Utter's analysis 

concerning the Privileges and Immunities clause, above, and here 

provides the Gunwall analysis of the &quot;Frequent Recurrence to 

Fundamental Principles&quot; clause:

     1. The textual language of the state constitution.

       The text of the state constitution may provide cogent 
       grounds for a decision different from that which would be 
       arrived at under the federal constitution. It may be more 
       explicit or it may have no precise federal counterpart at 
       all.

Gunwall at 61. Article 1  32 of the Constitution of the State of 

Washington reads in total:

       A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is 
       essential to the security of individual right and the 
       perpetuity of free government.

     Since no &quot;precise federal counterpart&quot; exists, the Court may 

find greater protection under this factor, and the plaintiff argues 

strenuously that it should.

     2. Significant differences in the texts of parallel provisions 

of the federal and state constitutions.

          Such differences may also warrant reliance on the state 
       constitution.  Even where parallel provision of the two 
       constitutions do not have meaningful differences, other 
       relevant provisions of the state constitution may require 
       that the state constitution be interpreted differently.

Id.  Since no parallel provision may be found in the federal 

constitution, this factor does not seem to apply to either find or 

not find greater protection under the state constitution.

     3. State constitutional and common law history. 

          This may reflect an intention to confer greater 
       protection from state government than the federal 
       constitution affords from the federal government. The 
       history of the adoption of a particular state 
       constitutional provision may reveal an intention that will 
       support reading the provision independently of federal law.

Id.  The constitutional history of Section 32 remains somewhat of a 

mystery.  The constitutions of Wisconsin, New Hampshire and Illinois 

contained clauses referencing fundamental principles, but the 

connection to individual rights was unique to Washington.  Brian 

Snure, &quot;A Frequent Recurrence to Fundamental Principles: Individual 

Rights, Free Government, and the Washington State Constitution,&quot; 67 

Wash. L. Rev. 669 (1992) at 676.

     The original proposed constitution by W. Liard Hill contained 

only 31 sections to Article 1.  Section 32 was proposed by George 

Turner, whose later speeches as a U.S. Senator lead to the 

conclusion that Turner, like others of his day, believed that 

constitutional interpretation often required a return to natural law 

principles beyond the four corners of the constitution.  Snure, Id. 

at 674, citing 32 Cong. Rec. 783, 785, 789 (1899)(statement of Sen. 

Turner against United States imperialism in the Philippines).

     The signers of Washington's constitution had witnessed a 

hundred years of what happens when power is concentrated in either 

government (federal) or private (corporate) bodies, and they clearly 

didn't like what they saw.  Thus, we have a clause in our &quot;freedom 

to bear arms&quot; clause stating that &quot;nothing in this section shall be 

construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize, 

maintain or employ an armed body of men.&quot;  Wash. Const. art. 1  24; 

and the mention of &quot;corporations, except municipal&quot; in the 

Privileges and Immunities clause, discussed above.

     In the decade before the Washington Constitutional Convention, 

the territory had grown from a virtual wilderness of 75,000 settlers 

cut off from the nation's capital by a month's travel time, to a 

state of 350,000 citizens who could reach the east coast by a three-

day train ride.  Snure, supra, citing Dorothy Johnson, &quot;Empire of 

the Columbia,&quot; (2d ed., 1967).  Most of the influx of settlers had 

experienced legislative abuse elsewhere, and in Washington as well.  

Snure, Id. at 671.  For example, during the 1862-63 territorial 

legislative session, the legislature passed no general laws, but 

enacted more than 150 pieces of general legislation for the benefit 

of &quot;private interests against the general welfare.&quot;  Id.

     Nor did the delegates trust the other branches of government.  

Governors abused their patronage powers, and judges were appointed 

from afar and often absent.  Id., citing, inter alia, Charles H. 

Sheldon, &quot;A Century of Judging: A Political History of the 

Washington Supreme Court,&quot; (1988).  Mining companies amassed armed 

guards to thwart unions activities, and railroads charged excessive 

rates to farmers.  Id., citing Gordon B. Ridgeway, &quot;Populism in 

Washington,&quot; 39 Pac. N.W. Hist. Q. 284-91 (1948). 

     All of these infringements on personal liberties came about 

despite the guarantees of liberty and democratic government found in 

the U.S. Constitution.

     It is noteworthy that Washington's Declaration of Rights is not 

couched in terms of the federal Bill of Rights, which contains the 

repeated phrase &quot;Congress shall make no law. . .&quot;  Rather, rights 

are stated affirmatively:  &quot;The right of petition. . .shall never be 

abridged,&quot; Art. 1  4; &quot;Every person may freely speak, write and 

publish on all subjects. . .&quot;  Art. 1  5.

     It is also noteworthy that Washington's constitution contains 

checks and balances on power missing from the federal constitution.  

The federal government now comprises four branches, the fourth being 

federal agencies created by Congress but accountable to nobody.  

This has been especially true since the U.S. Supreme Court decided 

INS V. Chadha 462 U.S. 919 (1982), which eliminated the &quot;legislative 

veto.&quot;  Prior to that, Congress could set up agencies to administer 

programs, then oversee progress by way of committee or single-house 

vote.  In what constitutional scholar and University of Seattle Law 

School Prof. David Skover calls &quot;the second most inane decision ever 

handed down,&quot; the U.S. Supreme Court virtually guaranteed the sort 

of petty tyranny that has resulted in this lawsuit.  (The Chadha 

decision did away with the &quot;legislative veto,&quot; on the theory that 

not only must the enabling legislation withstand bicameral majority 

vote and presentment for veto, but each subsequent &quot;fine-tuning&quot; of 

the agency must be done the same way -- clearly an administratively 

impossible task.)

     Washington's constitutional delegates may not have had Chadha 

as an example, but they had seen where government power was headed.  

In Washington, the fourth branch of government is the people: agency 

heads such as the Attorney General, Secretary of State, Treasurer, 

Auditor, Superintendent of Public Instruction and Commissioner of 

Public Lands are elected, not appointed.  Judges, likewise, are 

elected.

     The framers had also seen the concept of &quot;natural law&quot; twisted 

until it faced the direction opposite any original concept; 

originally a guarantee of personal liberty (for example, as set 

forth in the Declaration of Independence as &quot;inalienable rights&quot;), 

under the influence of the robber barons of the 19th century 

&quot;natural law&quot; was the justification for imposition of laessez-faire 

economics, i.e., natural law prohibited the courts from interfering 

with the right of a laborer to contract for his labor, and never 

mind that the laborer starves while the company owner thrives.

     Thus, the mention of &quot;a frequent recurrence to fundamental 

principles&quot; being linked (uniquely at the time) to individual 

liberty, and the lack of any reference to &quot;natural law&quot; along with 

the absence of a separation-of-powers clause in Washington's 

constitution has led at least one scholar to argue persuasively that 

the phrase amounts to retaining the notion that natural law should 

be considered when protecting individual rights, but not when 

invoking natural law to prevent adherence with social or safety 

legislation.

       Section 32 designates extra-constitutional fundamental 
       principles as essential to the security of individual 
       right. 

Snure, supra, note 30, page 687.  Again, it is no stretch to extend 

the right to be free from unjust action when it originates from a 

federal agency as opposed to originating from a corporation or other 

state entity.

     4. Preexisting state law.

       Previously established bodies of state law, including 
       statutory law, may also bear on the granting of distinctive 
       state constitutional rights.  State law may be responsive 
       to concerns of its citizens long before they are addressed 
       by analogous constitutional claims.  Preexisting law can 
       thus help to define the scope of a constitutional right 
       later established.

Gunwall, supra, 106 Wn.2d at 61, 62.

     Much of the preexisting law leading to the &quot;fundamental 

principles&quot; clause is discussed above.  As for laws preexisting the 

state constitution regarding the use of marijuana, medically or 

otherwise, there were none.  Inhaling opium and operating a house 

where inhaling opium took place were made illegal by the territorial 

laws of 1881, seven years before the signing of the Washington 

constitution.  The earliest reference the plaintiff could find to 

marijuana (&quot;cannabis&quot;) was in the Laws of 1951.  As discussed in 

Section II B 1 above, marijuana was widely and legally used in the 

last century and the early decades of this century, prohibited by 

neither state nor federal law.

     5. Differences in structure between the federal and state 

constitutions.

       The former is a grant of enumerated powers to the federal 
       government, and the latter serves to limit the sovereign 
       power which inheres directly in the people and indirectly 
       in their elected representatives.  Hence the explicit 
       affirmation of fundamental rights in our state constitution 
       may be seen as a guaranty (sic) of those rights rather than 
       as a restriction on them.

Gunwall, id.

     The plaintiff simply asks the Court to take these words at 

their face value, and look to fundamental principles, as required by 

Article I  32, to do justice.

     6. Matters of particular state interest or local concern.

       Is the subject matter local in character, or does there 
       appear to be a need for national uniformity?  The former 
       may be more appropriately addressed by resorting to the 
       state constitution.

     The plaintiff's physician is licensed to practice by the state.  

The plaintiff has undergone his cancer treatment in a state-owned 

and -regulated facility.  The state legislature has given the state 

Board of Pharmacy the power to place drugs in Schedules different 

from the federal government's determination, in RCW 69.50.201(e).  

And the state's constitution requires a &quot;frequent recurrence to 

fundamental principles,&quot; which the federal constitution does not.  

All of these and more make clear that the plaintiff's access to 

medicine is an issue of local significance; Washington's citizens 

should not be made to suffer by bureaucratic fiat from 2,000 miles 

away.


               <b>2. Fundamental principles in Washington case law.</b>

     The state constitution requires a &quot;frequent recurrence to 

fundamental principles,&quot; which raises the question, &quot;What principles 

are fundamental?&quot;

     Run the phrase &quot;fundamental principles&quot; through Westlaw or 

Lexis, and a sampling looks like this:

It is a fundamental principle that the imposition of business and 
  occupation tax liability must be as equitable as possible. 
  Fidelity Title Company v. State of Washington, Department of 
  Revenue, 49 Wn. App 662, 745 P.2d 530 (1987).  

<b>Reynolds Metal Company v. State, 65 Wn.2d 882, 400 P.2d 310.  Appeal</b> 
  <b>dismissed 382 US 1.60 (1965).</b>  

A fundamental principle of contract damages:  An insured should be 
  put in only as good  a position as he would have occupied had the 
  contract not been breached.  Greer v. Northwestern National 
  Insurance Company, 109 Wn.2d 191, 743 P.2d 1244 (1987).  

Fundamental principles of community property law dictate that each 
  spouse should upon his or her death have the right to dispose of 
  his or her one-half interest in community property.  Standard 
  Insurance Company v. Schwalbe, 47 Wn.  App 639, 737 P.2d 667 
  (1987).  

It is a fundamental principle that penal statutes will be strictly 
  construed as a means of assuring fairness to persons subjected to 
  the law by giving clear and unequivocal warning in language that 
  people generally would understand concerning actions that would 
  expose them to liability for penalties and what those penalties 
  would be.  State v. Enloe, 47 Wn. APp 165, 172, 734 P.2d 520 
  (1987). 

Law against discrimination (RCW 49.60) is not rooted in tort law, 
  but grows out of the fundamental principle that every citizen 
  deserves equal treatment without regard to race, color, religion, 
  sex or handicap.  Reese v. Sears Roebuck and Company, 107 Wn.2d, 
  563, 572, 731 P.2d 497 (1987).

To admit irrelevant, prejudicial evidence which would invite 
  speculation in a jury is contrary to the fundamental principles 
  of fairness and due process upon which our criminal justice 
  system is based.  State v. Smith, 106 Wn.2d 772, 780, 725 P.2d 
  951 (1986).

Fundamental principles applicable to a request for an injunction are 
  1) the proceeding is equitable and addressed to the sound 
  discretion of the trial court,  2)  The trial court is vested 
  with broad discretionary power to shape and fashion injunctive 
  relief to fit the particular facts, circumstances, and equities 
  of the case before it, and 3)  One of the essential criteria for 
  an injunctive relief is actual and substantial injury sustained 
  by the person seeking the injunction.  Brown v. Voss, 105 Wn.2d 
  366, 372, 715 P.2d 514 (1986).

General warrants and writs of assistance were &quot;The worst instrument 
  of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty and 
  the fundamental principles of law, that ever was found in an 
  English law book,&quot; and so far as they place &quot;the liberty of every 
  man in the hands of every petty officer.&quot;  State v. Crandall, 39 
  Wn. APp 849, 855, 697 P.2d 250 (1985).  Citing the works of John 
  Adams 523-24(Chaz. F. Adams ed. Boston 1850; see also T. Taylor 
  Two Studies in Constitutional Interpretation 41 (1969)).

It is a fundamental principle regarding the attorney client 
  relationship that a fiduciary relationship exists as a matter of 
  law between an attorney and a client.  Estate of Larson, 103 
  Wn.2d 517, 520, 694 P.2d 1051 (1985).

There is a fundamental principle that every competent citizen is 
  under an obligation to further the administration of justice as a 
  matter of public policy when summoned by due process of law to 
  give evidence.  State v. Dibley, 38 Wn. APp 824, 828, 691 P.2d 
  201 (1984).

       &#149;The fundamental principle that &quot;the required criminal 
       conduct must have existed when the conduct at issue 
       occurred&quot; must apply to bar retroactive criminal 
       prohibitions emanating from courts as well as legislators.  
       State v. Gore, 101 Wn.2d 481, 489, 681 P.2d 227 (1984).

Fundamental principle of Washington Electoral Law is that in a 
  partisan contest there should be only one nominee from each 
  political party.  Democratic Party of Washington v. Spellman, 101 
  Wn.2d 94, 97, 675 P.2d 1222 (1984).

       &#149;It is a fundamental principle that no state may impose a 
       tax which discriminates against interstate commerce by 
       providing a direct commercial advantage to local business.  
       Department of Fisheries v. DeWatto Fish Company, 34 Wn. 
       APp 135, 146, 660 P.2d 298 (1983).

       &#149;It is a fundamental principle that when the state 
       condemns land for public use, no greater estate or 
       interest should be taken than reasonably necessary for 
       contemplated public necessity or use.  State v. McDonald, 
       98 Wn.2d 521, 530, 656 P.2d 1043 (1983).

     Clearly, case law analysis shows that &quot;fundamental principles&quot; 

may be found outside and in addition to the clear statements 

contained in documents such as the Bill of Rights.


               <b>3. Fundamental principles and the plaintiff's case.</b>
         
     Three cases citing Article I  32 bear on the case at bar:

The doctrine of stare decisis should not result in outmoded 19th 

  century precedents being forced to resolve 20th century disputes 

  -- automobiles should not be governed by horse and buggy laws.  

  Foote v. Grant, 55 Wn.2d 797, 806-7, 350 P.2d 870 (1960).

Likewise, in a case involving the &quot;taking&quot; of property by creating 

  loud jet noise in the airspace over it, the Supreme Court of 

  Washington held:

       The invention of the airplane and the development of modern 
       air transportation . . . have occurred somewhat 
       subsequently to the development of the legal concepts 
       emphasized in formulating early common law theories of 
       liability.  An awareness of these changes makes it 
       incumbent upon us to heed the advice of the framers of the 
       Washington constitution when they said: &quot;A frequent 
       recurrence to fundamental principles is essential to the 
       security of individual right and the perpetuity of free 
       government.&quot;

Ackerman v. Port of Seattle, 55 Wn.2d 400, 407, 348 P.2d 664 

(1960)(citation omitted).  In both of the above cases, the 

correlation to the case at bar is clear: Times change, new 

information becomes known, and legal theories adequate in times past 

should be changed to do justice.

     As a direct parallel, it is a fundamental principle that a drug 

prohibited when it was believed to have no medicinal use should not 

remain prohibited after it is shown that it is beneficial, and 

indeed unique in its ability to relieve suffering.

In a much more recent case, the Supreme Court held that while 

  massive, intrusive searches of apartment buildings may in fact 

  enhance public safety,

       it is often when government is most eagerly pursuing what 
       it perceives to be the public interest that it is most 
       likely to sidestep constitutional safeguards or to 
       denigrate constitutional liberties.  For precisely such 
       reasons, our constitution wisely counsels us:

          A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is 
       essential to the security of individual right and the 
       perpetuity of free government. . .

          We therefore cannot permit these warrants to be 
       executed, regardless of Seattle's pressing (and undoubtedly 
       laudable) desire to see its housing codes enforced.

City of Seattle v. McCready, 123 Wn.2d 260, 281, 868 P.2d 134 (1994) 

(citation omitted).

     This is precisely the case now before the Court.  The 

government &quot;is most eagerly pursuing what it perceives to be the 

public interest&quot; in retaining a valuable therapeutic drug in a 

prohibited category, and in doing so is violating the fundamental 

right of its citizens to be free of needless physical suffering.

     Other fundamental principles which the plaintiff asks the Court 

to consider, and recur to as the constitution requires, are these:

It is a fundamental principle that irrational laws breed disrespect 

  for the rule of law.  It is irrational to prohibit physicians 

  from prescribing marijuana while permitting them to prescribe 

  opium and cocaine.  It is irrational to force the plaintiff and 

  others in his situation to choose between physical suffering and 

  undertaking a criminal act.

Citizens of Washington who have a medical need for marijuana are 

  immune, under State v. Diana, supra, from prosecution.  It is a 

  fundamental principle that if a citizen foreseeably will not be 

  prosecuted, he should not be arrested, jailed, and put to the 

  expense, humiliation and vexation of dealing with criminal 

  charges.  This is especially true when, as is the case, the very 

  conditions which render them immune from prosecution make them 

  some of society's most helpless citizens, least able to deal with 

  such legal intrusions in their lives with any grace or dignity.

It is a fundamental principle that a physician should have access to 

  proven therapeutic drugs to relieve the suffering of his or her 

  patients.

It is a fundamental principle that the government of Washington 

  should not deny therapeutic drugs to its weakest and most 

  afflicted citizens merely to &quot;match statutes&quot; with federal laws 

  which are driven by political and irrational decisions, made by 

  bureaucrats who corrupt the process set forth in the enabling 

  statutes created by Congress.

It is a fundamental principle that the federal government should not 

  be permitted to withhold valuable medicine from Washington 

  citizens by first claiming that no scientific evidence supports 

  the therapeutic value of the medicine, then denying permission to 

  gather the scientific evidence to prove (or perhaps disprove) the 

  therapeutic value.


                        <b>IV. CONCLUSION</b>

     This Court, sitting in equity, should exercise its statutory 

and constitutional power to declare that the placing of marijuana in 

Schedule I, RCW 69.50.204, is a violation of the plaintiff's rights 

and liberties secured by Article I  12 and 32 of  the Constitution 

of the State of Washington.

HARRIS, Justice.

     A statutory change called for revocation of drivers' 
operating privileges upon certain listed criminal convictions.  
The question here is whether the change applies to convictions 
that occurred after the effective date, but for acts committed 
previously.  The district court reversed such a revocation, 
determining that to allow it would amount to an ex post facto 
application of the law.  We affirm.
     Petitioner Wanda Joy Hills was arrested for operating a 
motor vehicle while intoxicated on April 1, 1993.  Following a 
search incident to arrest, she was also charged with possession 
of marijuana in violation of then Iowa Code section 204.401(3) 
(1991) (section 204.401(3) has since been renumbered as section 
<A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A> (1995)).
     Hills arranged to plead guilty to the marijuana possession 
charge at a pretrial conference, initially scheduled for June 29, 
1993.  On June 22, however, the district court, on its own 
motion, changed the date of the pretrial hearing to July 2, 1993.  
Hills entered her guilty plea on July 2.  In the meantime, on 
July 1, 1993, Iowa Code section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> became effective.  It 
provides for mandatory revocation by the DOT of the driver's 
license of anyone convicted of a controlled substance offense 
under Code section <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401</A>. [footnote 1]
     The DOT revoked Hills' license over her protest that there 
could be no revocation on the basis of occurrences prior to July 
1, 1993.  On judicial review
____________________

     [footnote 1]  Iowa Code  <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> states:

          Mandatory revocation.  The department shall upon twenty 
     days' notice and without preliminary hearing revoke the 
     license or operating privilege of an operator upon receiving 
     a record of the operator's conviction for any of the 
     following offenses, when such conviction has become final:

          ....

          8.  A controlled substance offense under section 
     <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401</A> ....

                                3

the district count reversed the agency action, holding that, to 
apply the new statute to offenses committed prior to its 
effective date, violated the ex post facto principles of the 
state and federal constitutions.  The DOT brought this appeal to 
challenge the holding.
     I.  Ex post facto applications of law are prohibited by 
article I section 9 clause 3 of the United States Constitution 
and by article I section 21 of the Iowa Constitution.  The ex 
post facto clauses forbid

     [punishing as a crime] an act previously committed, which 
     was innocent when done, [or making] more burdensome the 
     punishment for a crime, after its commission, or [depriving] 
     one charged with crime of any defense available according to 
     [the] law at the time when the act was committed.

Adair Benevolent Soc'y v. State, 489 N.W.2d 1, 4 (Iowa 1992); see 
also State v. Kaster, 469 N.W.2d 671, 673-74 (Iowa 1991).  The ex 
post facto prohibition applies only to penal and criminal 
actions, not to civil actions.  State v. Taggart, 186 Iowa 247, 
254, 172 N.W. 299, 301 (1919) (citing Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. (3 
Dall.) 386 (1798)).  Our review of this constitutional question 
is de novo.  State v. Niehaus, 452 N.W.2d 184, 187 (Iowa 1990).
     II.  The question is whether the revocation was, in essence, 
a punishment.  If so the ex post facto prohibition would apply.  
On the other hand if the revocation was merely a civil penalty, 
designed to enhance public safety, the ex post facto prohibition 
would not apply.  This is because civil penalties do not violate 
ex post facto clauses, even though their penalties may be 
retroactive and more burdensome.  Thus our controlling question 
is whether license revocation based on possession of a controlled 
substance is a civil penalty or a criminal (or a quasi-criminal) 
punishment.
     The State argues that license revocations are civil in 
nature, and as an abstract proposition cases support this 
contention.  See, e.g., State v. Moret, 486 N.W.2d 589, 591 (Iowa 
1992) (driver's license suspension of a habitual

                                 4

offender of motor vehicle laws is for public safety, not for 
punishment of the offender); State v. Blood, 360 N.W.2d 820, 822 
(Iowa 1985) (driver's license revocation for OWI not intended as 
punishment but designed solely for the protection of the public).  
In State v. Funke, ___ N.W.2d ___, ___ (Iowa 1995), we rejected a 
former jeopardy challenge to a driver's license revocation on the 
basis that a civil proceeding was involved, not a criminal one.  
Because it was a civil proceeding, we found the former jeopardy 
prohibition no impediment to the revocation because the statute 
authorizing revocation did not serve both the twin goals of 
punishment-deterrence and retribution.  We said public safety -- 
not punishment -- was the goal; deterrence and retribution were 
not involved.  Id. at ___.
     Our Funke former jeopardy holding, however, does not 
necessarily control Hills' ex post facto challenge.  Ex post 
facto, in contrast with former jeopardy challenges, cannot be 
posited on civil matters.  Iowa has limited the doctrine to cases 
criminal in nature.  In re Ponx, 276 N.W.2d 425, 428 (Iowa 1979).  
This limitation on the ex post facto doctrine applies even where 
the civil consequences are "serious" in nature.  Id.
     The question then is whether Hills' license revocation, 
based on the controlled substance violation, was civil or 
criminal in nature.  The answer turns on whether the essential 
aim of the controlled substance revocation was to promote highway 
safety.  We think in this respect it differs from the "habitual 
offender" revocation statute we considered in Funke.
     In contending the revocation is civil in nature, the DOT 
argues there is a "direct connection" between the possession of 
controlled substances, driving, and public safety.  The district 
court did not perceive such a connection and neither do we.  
Persons who illegally possess drugs are of course subject to 
appropriate criminal punishment.  But many such persons choose 
not to drive.  When they

                                 5

do not, they do not affect highway safety.  Any connection 
between drugs, driving, and public safety is at most indirect.  
The amended statute authorizing this license revocation was aimed 
essentially at enhancing punishment for controlled substance 
possession.  As such it was quasi-criminal and not civil in 
nature.  Ex post facto principles therefore prohibit application 
of the amended statute.  The district court was correct in so 
holding.

     AFFIRMED.</PRE></HTML>

<h2>Co-sponsors Needed for Federal Medical Marijuana Bill</h2><P>

<B>Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) recently introduced H.R. 2618, a federal medical marijuana bill.  H.R. 2618 reschedules marijuana from schedule I to schedule II, thereby making it available by prescription.  This bill was first introduced 1981 and was co-sponsored by four Republicans, including Rep. Newt Gingrich, then an obscure second-term congressman from suburban Atlanta.  The measure was subsequently reintroduced (H.R. 4498) in early 1982 with 71 additional co-sponsors.<P>

If your member of Congress is supportive of medical marijuana, please take a moment to contact him/her to urge they co-sponsor the Frank medical marijuana bill.  Interested members or staff should contact Mr. Robert Raben on Rep. Frank's staff (202-225-6906).<P>

Although more research is needed, it is clear from rapidly accumulating anecdotal evidence that marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and suffering for patients with a number of serious ailments, and that it is less toxic and costly than the conventional medicines for which it may be substituted.<P>

Marijuana is an effective means of overcoming nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, and nausea and appetite loss in the wasting syndrome of AIDS.  It is also useful for various spastic conditions including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia, and it lowers intraocular pressure in people who suffer from open-angle glaucoma.  For some people with epilepsy it is the only anticonvulsant that works.  It has been used for centuries as an analgesic and is considered by many to be the best approach to migraine.  It is also useful to some patients for the symptomatic treatment of depression, menstrual cramps, asthma and pruritus.<P>

Many seriously ill patients in this country are already using marijuana to reduce their pain and suffering, even though they must risk arrest to obtain and use it.  Informal buyers' clubs supplying marijuana to the seriously ill have been formed in many cities.  Some of these clubs are small and almost clandestine; a few, such as the one in San Francisco, operate openly and serve several thousand clients on a regular basis.  Despite these heroic efforts, the underground emergency distribution system reaches only a small proportion of the tens of thousands of patients who could benefit from legal marijuana.<P>

This bill would amend federal law to permit physicians to prescribe marijuana to patients suffering from cancer, AIDS, glaucoma or spastic condition including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia and quadriplegia.  Thirty-six states have adopted legislation designed to facilitate the availability of medical marijuana, but none of these programs can be implemented without a an amendment to federal law.<P>

<h1><i>Bill Would End Ban on Medical Marijuana</i></h1>

<p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 -- The Drug Policy Foundation today
applauded the introduction of a bill in the House of
Representatives that would allow doctors to prescribe marijuana
for the first time in over five decades. The bill, H.R. 2618, was
introduced by Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.). It is modeled on
legislation sponsored in the early 1980s by several members of
Congress, including Republicans Newt Gingrich (Ga.), Bill
McCollum (Fla.), John Porter (Ill.) and Frank Wolf (Va.).</p>

<p>David C. Condliffe, DPF's executive director, said, &quot;Most
Americans are shocked when they learn that a doctor cannot
prescribe marijuana to seriously ill patients, including cancer
and AIDS patients. Polls repeatedly show that the public favors
giving doctors the authority to prescribe marijuana to patients
who find no relief from other medicines. But the federal
government has refused to budge. Barney Frank's bill would end
this cruel policy and help thousands of Americans. His leadership
on this vital issue is admirable.&quot;</p>

<p>Currently, 36 states have endorsed the medical use of
marijuana. However, state acts that recognize marijuana's medical
usefulness are mainly symbolic because the federal government has
classified marijuana as a Schedule I drug, which means that it
has no officially sanctioned medical use. H.R. 2618 would
reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug, along with cocaine
and amphetamines, which are tightly regulated. The bill would
establish an office in the Department of Health and Human
Services to administer a domestic medical marijuana supply that
would be distributed to patients through licensed hospitals and
pharmacies.</p>

<p>Harvard Medical School professor and DPF Advisory Board member
Dr. Lester Grinspoon said, &quot;The fact that thousands of
people daily break the law by going to underground Cannabis
Buyers Clubs is powerful testimony to the importance of this
legislation. These people are being open about using cannabis
because it relieves their symptoms better than legally available
medicines, not because they want better access to a recreational
drug.&quot;</p>

The Drug Policy Foundation                                     Nov. 13,1995
News Release                                                         Page 2
</pre>

<p>&quot;Even as an illegal drug, cannabis stands out among the
modern medicines as a safe and effective treatment for a wide
range of symptoms,&quot; Grinspoon added. &quot;For example, it
appears to be the best drug available to treat the nausea and
vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. Cannabis can also
be used to control the nausea from AIDS or the drugs used to
treat it, to reduce muscle spasms brought on by multiple
sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia, to lower intraocular
pressure in people who have open-angle glaucoma, to suppress an
epileptic's convulsions, to treat painful migraines. The list
goes on.&quot;</p>

<p>DPF President Arnold Trebach said, &quot;This bill would
provide not just relief but dignity to patients suffering from
life- and sense-threatening diseases. It makes no sense to force
patients into a black market where neither their safety nor the
purity of their medicine is guaranteed.&quot;</p>

<p>Trebach added, &quot;The Drug Policy Foundation welcomes H.R.
2618 after having worked for years as lead counsel in a lawsuit
to reschedule marijuana. One of the important results of that
suit was that, in 1988, the Drug Enforcement Administration's
chief administrative law judge agreed with us that marijuana was
a remarkably safe and medically useful drug.&quot;</p>

<p>Since 1987, the Drug Policy Foundation has been a lead party
in the suit to get the DEA to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule
II drug. Most recently, in February 1994, the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington, D.C., upheld the DEA's authority to
maintain the medical ban on marijuana, despite evidence of its
value.</p>

<p>Grinspoon, co-author of Marihuana, The Forbidden Medicine
(Yale University Press, 1993), commented, &quot;My
representative, Barney Frank, is making an invaluable
contribution to medical science with his bill. It will spur more
and better research on a drug that, through popular
misunderstandings, has been wrongfully excluded from modern
medicine. At the same time, we must recognize that cannabis is
not a perfect drug and that it won't work for all patients.
Still, it will be a major step forward when doctors and patients
can exercise the choice to use cannabis - especially when nothing
else in the pharmacopoeia works.&quot;</p>

Washington, D.C. 20515<P>

Dear Representative McCullum:<P>

I am writing to request that you cosponsor a bill which will be introduced by my representative, The Honorable Barney Frank of Massachusetts.  This bill would allow physicians to prescribe cannabis to patients with certain medical symptoms and syndromes.  It is modeled after a similar bill which you co-sponsored in 198I and again in 1983.<P>

The urgent need for such iegislation is indicated by the fact that thousands of patients in 26 cities have formed Cannabis Buyers Clubs throuqh which, with a note from their doctors, they can obtain at cost a small amount ot marihuana (cannabis) for medical use.  They are risking arrest because they have found that marihuana relieves their symptoms better than the available legal medicines.  For example, it appears to be the best available treatment for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy.  Many people with AIDS also suffer from nausea caused by the disease itself or the drugs needed to treat it.  In most of these people marihuana eliminates the nausea more effectively than conventional antinauseants.  Marihuana is also used in the treatment of glaucoma, migraine, and muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, parapleqia, and quadriplegia.  Again, it is often safer and more effective than any of the legal medicines available for these purposes.<P>

This medical marihuaha bill would allow people who need medical cannabis to obtain it legally with a doctor's prescription, and to use it without having to suffer the anxiety created by its iilegal status.  A growing number of citizens and physicians have come to understand that outlawing the medical use of cannabis is both unscientific and immoral.  A recent national poll indicates that 85% of Americans are in favor of allowing medical marihuana, and 36 states now have passed laws designed to facilitate its availability.  These hopes cannot be realized until the federal qovernment passes similar legislation.<P>

I am enclosinq a copy of a <a href="lester.html">Commentary</a> published in the June, 1995, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association which may help you to understand why your support for Representative Frank's bill is important.  If you would like to learn more about this issue, I would be glad to send you a copy of a book written by James B. Bakalar and me (Marihuana, the Forbidden Medicine, Yale University Press, 1993).  If I can help in any other way, please get in touch with me.  My telephone and fax numbers are listed below.<P>

Thank you for considering cosponsorship of this most important and humane legislation.<P>


Sincerely yours,<P>

Lester Grinspoon, M.D.<P>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><BR><DD>There is a God and we believe in Him.&nbsp;  He is not a person nor a physical being.&nbsp;  He is spirit and He is universal intelligence.&nbsp;  Never deny that there is a God.&nbsp;  God being universal intelligence created the universe out of that intelligence.&nbsp;  It is intelligence that creates.&nbsp;  Man is a part of the creation of universal intelligence and man was created in the image and likeness of God only by his intelligence.&nbsp;  It is the intelligence of man that is like God, but man's intelligence is only a unitary particle of God's universal intelligence.
<BR><DD>God out of His universal intelligence made matter and made mind.&nbsp;  That matter is made by God and man is matter as well as mind; then man must be in the image of God, because nothing could exist without God.&nbsp;  As God made the universe out of His universal knowledge or intelligence so man in his unitary knowledge or intelligence can make a typewriter, an automobile or a chair, but cannot make the universe because his unitary intelligence is not as much or as great as universal intelligence.&nbsp;  All the unitary intelligence of the universe goes to make God who is the embodiment of all intelligence, so no man can be as great as God because he is only a unit of God and God is the whole.
<BR><DD>No man therefore can measure God nor ask God questions because he is not as intelligent as God and therefore cannot understand God.&nbsp;  It is presumptuous therefore, when man questions God from his limited unitary intelligence.
<BR><DD>Man never dies.&nbsp;  Nothing dies.&nbsp;  Man is made of body and spirit.&nbsp;  The spirit is God.&nbsp;  It is intelligence.&nbsp;  The body of man is matter.&nbsp;  It changes from living matter in the man to other matter in the soil.&nbsp;  It is always the same matter.&nbsp;  It doesn't die in the sense of how we understand death.&nbsp;  It changes.&nbsp;  When man sleeps and passes away in the flesh he goes to earth that lives on, out of which other men and things are formed.&nbsp;  All matter is related so man is related to earth and earth related to man.&nbsp;  We eat ourselves over and over again.&nbsp;  When we eat the apple, the banana, the fig, the cherry, the grape, when we drink the water, we are eating and drinking ourselves over and over again, so nothing is lost and nothing dies, so do not be afraid of death, because what you call death is only change and you are still in the universe either in the spirit of God to whom your spirit goes after the change or as matter which goes on forever.
<BR><DD>You are related to the flower, to the beautiful rose, to the trees, to the fish and to other animals just as you are related to God.
<BR><DD>All of you sprung from God who is universal intelligence.&nbsp;  Do not be more cowardly than the rose, the apple, the coconut, the sheep, the fish or the cow to do that which all must, and which we call death, to die.&nbsp;  If you are going to weep to die then the rose should weep to die.&nbsp;  If you weep you are a coward.&nbsp;  Die like a man because you are not lost, you are still there.&nbsp;  You only weep because you are a glutton, because you think you will not get any more to eat and drink and any more happy times; just as you have been feeding upon things, and other beings who came here before you, so someone else must feed on you to make creation true, otherwise God would not be fair to everybody and everything, and God is fair and just and no respecter of persons or things.

guide of every modern statesman and ruler to enable him to 
successfully protect the national interests involved.&nbsp;  Any 
tyro who has read European history knows that the 
Machiavellian policy is as evident today as in the day of 
the originator of the policy, and politically the 
diplomatic word must be taken not in the literal sense but 
with a grain of salt.&nbsp;  Undertakings between Governments 
should be considered from the angle of diplomacy which 
generally hides the truth that is intended.

<P><DD>Haile Selassie was not able to understand the hidden 
methods and motives encouched in diplomatic papers and ad-
vices.&nbsp;  The result was, as Machiavelli would suggest, his 
being trapped to the advantage of the astute Mussolini, 
whose diplomacy for the good of Italy could well be 
understood by the keen diplomat.

<P><DD>When it is understood that Haile Selassie ruled over a 
State with more than twelve million people and one of the 
richest in the world in natural resources, his best friends 
surely cannot compliment him for leaving that country in 
the hands of a foreign foe, and by the methods he adopted.</FONT>

whose policy was strictly aggressive.&nbsp;  He resorted senti-
mentally to prayer and to feasting and fasting, not 
consistent with the policy that secures the existence of 
present-day freedom for peoples whilst other nations and 
rulers are building up armaments of the most destructive 
kind as the only means of securing peace and protection.&nbsp;  
He reclined on the peculiar policy of leaving everything to 
the Almighty Wisdom of the Universal Creator Who, in all 
history, has never yet taken political sides between two 
rival human political forces and powers.&nbsp;  For God to 
maintain his equilibrium, He cannot take sides in human 
political differences between peoples and nations, 
otherwise He would cease to be the God of the one, yet 
positively declaring Himself to be the God of the other.&nbsp;  
So as the result shows, God had nothing to do with the 
campaign of Italy in Abyssinia, for on the one side we had 
the Pope of the Catholic Church blessing the Crusade and 
the other the Coptic Church fasting and praying with 
confidence of victory.</FONT>

Surely God was not on the side of the Italians helping them 
to disload the gas of death.&nbsp;  The Abyssinians lost.&nbsp;  God 
could not have been on their side either.&nbsp;  It is logical 
therefore that God didn't take sides, but left the matter 
to be settled by the strongest human battalion.&nbsp;  Haile 
Selassie had no equipment and no food.&nbsp;  He never even had 
gas masks.&nbsp;  The Emperor remained in the Palace long enough 
to give the Italians a good foothold in Abyssinia, and then 
when he left the Palace it was only for seeing his poorly 
equipped soldiers flee before the enemy and to gain time 
for himself to get back to the Palace and flee the country 
with all he could lay his hands on, leaving the unfortunate 
people to the mercy of the heartless invader.

<P><DD>These are the facts.&nbsp;  Those who do not want to know them 
may, like the ostrich, hide their heads in the sand; but 
those of us who know and understand, realize that battles 
are not won this way.

<P><DD>We are sorry for the Emperor, because we realize he 
didn't know better.&nbsp;  As a fact, he didn't know what it was 
all about, but that it was just a matter of attacking his 
Divine right of being Emperor and that the consequence 
could well be left to God Who ordained the Divinity that 
made him Emperor.</FONT>

                     MARIJUANA AS A HOLY SACRAMENT:
     IS THE USE OF PEYOTE CONSTITUTIONALLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THAT
             OF MARIJUANA IN BONA FIDE RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES?


&quot;And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed.&quot; 
Genesis 1:29 (King James). 


     This past April, within one week, the Supreme Court: 1) denied 

certiorari to Carl Eric Olsen, an Ethiopian Zion Coptic priest appealing 

the denial of a DEA exemption for the sacramental use of marijuana; 

[footnote 1] and 2) held that the State of Oregon could deny unemployment 

compensation to two Native Americans who had been fired for the 

sacramental use of peyote. [footnote 2]  Similarities between the two 

cases end there.  The Supreme Court's latter holding does not change the 

fact that Congress and the Drug Enforcement Administration (&quot;DEA&quot;), have 

decided to accommodate the religious practices of the Native American 

Church (&quot;NAC&quot;), and accord it a preferential position by establishing, 

pursuant to regulation, its right to religious drug use over against all 

other churches. {footnote 3]  Part I of this article will set forth the 

favorable treatment which the federal government extends to the NAC 

regarding its unlimited exemption to use peyote in religious ceremonies.

I.   THE NATIVE AMERICAN CHURCH ENJOYS A DEA EXEMPTION FROM THE 
     FEDERAL DRUG LAWS PROHIBITING INGESTION OF PEYOTE 

     A. The Native American Church 

     When one tries to solidify a definition of the NAC, it must be 

remembered that America has 307 Native American tribes living within its 

borders. [footnote 8]  There is no majority control of the NAC and as a 

result, the only statement &quot;that is safe to make is that there is, in 

many places and in many ways, a concept of a Native American Church.&quot; 

[footnote 9]  How the NAC conducts its rituals and celebrates its 

sacrament is subject to myriad differences.&quot; [footnote 10]

     While the NAC has no recorded theology, members combine certain 

Christian teachings with the belief that peyote embodies the Holy Spirit. 

[footnote 11]  It is believed that those who partake of peyote enter into 

direct contact with God and experience a heightened sense of 

comprehension which includes a deep feeling of compassion for others. 

[footnote 12] 

     Worship in the NAC centers around the &quot;peyote meeting&quot; which begins 

at sundown and continues at least until day break. [footnote 13] 

Normally, the ceremony is conducted to give thanks or to receive 

guidance. [footnote 14]  Participants sit in a circle around a fire, 

[footnote 15] consume peyote during the ceremony, and may pray, sing, or 

use a drum. [footnote 16]  Other accouterments can include a fan, eagle 

bone or feather, whistle, rattle, and/or a prayer cigarette. [footnote 

17]  While the membership of the NAC is estimated to consist of between 

250,000 and 400,000 people, [footnote 18] there are no official 

prerequisites to

are wide differences of opinion within the NAC regarding what constitutes 

a member. [footnote 20] 

     B. Peyote 

     Peyote, an hallucinogenic cactus, [footnote 21] has effects similar 

to lysergic acid diethylamide (&quot;LSD&quot;). [footnote 22]  &quot;The major active 

ingredient in peyote is mescaline.&quot; [footnote 23]  The precursor of the 

DEA, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (&quot;BNDD&quot;), [footnote 24] 

has

     [footnote 20]  id. 

     [footnote 21]  Peyote, which is native to the region of the Rio 
Grande Valley and southward, is a plant classified botanically as 
Lophorphora Williamsii Lemaire.  It is a small, spineless, low growing 
cactus and is carrot or turnip-like in shape and size.  Only the fleshy, 
rounded top grows above ground.  After the pincushion top is sliced off 
and dried, it becomes a hard and brittle disk-like button, which is used 
ceremoniously to produce &quot;profound sensory and psychic phenomena.&quot;  35 
Fed. Reg. 14789-90 (1970). 

     [footnote 22]  Id.  LSD is a &quot;Psychedelic&quot; which refers to a class 
of drugs including mescaline and marijuana, among others, whose primary 
effect is to expand consciousness, heighten intellectual activity, and 
increase sensory awareness.  Leary v. United States, 383 F.2d 851, 858, 
860 (5th Cir. 1967), rev'd on other grounds, 395 U.S. 6 (1969).  
Researchers have found that religious reactions in those partaking of 
psychedelic drugs are present in varying degrees from about 25% to 90% of 
all users.  United States v. Kuch, 288 F. Supp. 439, 444 (D.D.C. 1968).  
A &quot;religious reaction&quot; is defined as a sharpening of the senses and a 
mixed feeling of awe and fear.  There may be a sense of mystery, peace, 
and a sharpening of impressions as to all natural objects, perhaps 
something like the vision Moses had of the burning bush.  Id.

reported that mescaline may produce an altered consciousness marked by: 

1) confused mental states and dreamlike revivals of past traumatic 

events; 2) alteration of sensory perception evidenced by visual illusions 

and distortion of space and perspective; 3) alteration of mood with 

anxiety, euphoria, or ecstacy; 4) alteration of ideation with impairment 

of concentration and intelligence; and 5) alteration of personality with 

impairment of conscious functioning and the deterioration of inhibitions. 

[footnote 25]  Indeed, ingestion of peyote may result in such severe 

reactions as psychosis and suicide. [footnote 26]  The federal drug laws 

which prohibit peyote use, however, do not apply to participants who 

ingest peyote as part of the NAC religious ritual. [footnote 27] 

     C. The Controlled Substances Act

comprehensive system of federal drug control laws in the United States.

ingestion of peyote may result in fetal abnormalities, incurable 
psychosis, and personality disintegration); 742 F.2d at 197. 

     [footnote 26]  See id.  On the other hand, some report that through 
the use of peyote: 1) euphoria and good feelings are heightened; 2) 
colors and music are more vivid and more pleasing; 3) prayers take on an 
intense philosophical and ethical quality; and 4) a state of inner peace 
takes place where the individual may experience visions or sensations of 
the supernatural.  A. Marriott, supra note 9, at 70.  Peyote is not

substances, with Schedule I containing those substances subject to the 

most restrictive control. [footnote 29]  Schedule I substances are 

defined as those which meet the following three criteria: 

     1)  &quot;a high potential for abuse&quot;; 

     2)  &quot;no currently accepted medical use in treatment in 
     the United States&quot;; and 

     3)  &quot;a lack of accepted safety for use ... under 
     medical supervision.&quot; [footnote 30] 

Peyote is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance [footnote 31] 

of the CSA which prohibits its distribution, its possession with intent 

to distribute, and its possession without a prescription. [footnote 32] 

     Section 1307.03 of the Code of Federal Regulations allows a 

petitioner to apply for an exception to &quot;any provision&quot; of the

     [footnote 30]  21 U.S.C. &#167; 812(b)(1) (1988). 

     [footnote 31]  Other Schedule I substances include marijuana, LSD, 
and heroin.  21 U.S.C. &#167; 812(c) (1988). 

     [footnote 32]  21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 812(c)(c)(12), 841, 844 (1988).  The 
manufacture and distribution of peyote were first prohibited by federal 
law in the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, which were superseded 
by the CSA.  21 U.S.C. &#167; 812(c), Schedule I(c)(12) cited in Native Am.  
Church of N.Y. v. United States, 468 F. Supp. 1247, 1249 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) 
(also citing 79 Stat. 226 &#167; 3(a)). 

          &quot;Peyote was classified as a 'narcotic' in the Narcotic Farm Act 
of 1929, 45 Stat. 1085, to enable peyote 'addicts' to seek treatment at 
federal facilities.  The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 also 
classified peyote as a narcotic or hypnotic substance, 52 Stat. 1050, and 
imposed certain labeling requirements.  Neither statute prohibited the 
manufacture or distribution of peyote.&quot;  Amicus Memorandum before DEA, 
July 1988, App. 16, at 404 n.3 (Memorandum Opinion for the Chief Counsel, 
DEA, Dec. 22, 1981).

drug prohibitions. [footnote 33]  Indeed, evidence may be presented to 

the Attorney General by any interested party in order to determine 

whether a particular drug should be reclassified, added, or removed from 

the schedules. [footnote 34]  The CSA also authorizes the Attorney 

General to establish registration procedures to permit persons to 

manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances and confers 

broad authority to grant and waive registration requirements. [footnote

prohibitions; nonetheless, in 1965, Congress passed the Drug

substances, registration of manufacturers, labeling of substances,

1977) (&quot;Recognizing that the results of continuing research might cast 
doubts on the wisdom of initial classification assignments, Congress 
created a procedure by which changes in scheduling could be effected.&quot;).  
Citing marijuana as an example, Congress noted the need for flexibility 
when it enacted the CSA: 
     The extent to which marihuana should be controlled is a 
     subject upon which opinions diverge widely.  There are 
     some who not only advocate its legalization but would 
     encourage its use; at the other extreme there are some 
     States which have established the death penalty for 
     distribution of marihuana to minors.

Abuse Control Amendments with the understanding that bona fide religious 

use of peyote was exempt from regulation. [footnote 36]  The 
____________________

     [footnote 36]  After the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, 79 
Stat. 226 &#167; 3(a) (&quot;H.R. 2&quot;), passed the Senate and were being debated in 
the House, Congressman Harris stated the following: 
          Mr. Harris:  The last amendment of substance made 
     by the Senate deletes the provisions of the House bill 
     which provided that the term &quot;depressant or stimulant 
     drug&quot; does not include peyote used in connection with 
     ceremonies of a bona fide religious organization. 
          Some concern has been expressed by many of the 
     religious groups affected, and by certain civil 
     liberties organizations concerning the possible impact 
     of this amendment on religious practices protected by 
     the first amendment to the Constitution. 
          Two court decisions have been rendered in this 
     area in recent years.  One, a decision by Judge Yale 
     McFate in the case of Arizona v. Attakai, No. 4098, in 
     the superior court of Maricopa County, Phoenix, 
     Arizona, July 26, 1960; and a California decision, 
     People against Woody, decided August 24, 1964, in the 
     Supreme Court of California.  Both these cases held 
     that prosecutions for the use of peyote in connection 
     with religious ceremonies was a violation of the first 
     amendment to the Constitution. 
          In view of all this, I requested the views of the 
     Food and Drug Administration and have been assured that 
     the bill, even with [sic without] the peyote exemption 
     appearing in the House-passed bill, cannot forbid bona 
     fide religious use of peyote. 
          Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to 
     include the letter from the Food and Drug 
     Administration at this point in my remarks. 
          Dear Mr. chairman: In response to your 
          request we are stating the position the Food 
          and Drug Administration expects to take if 
          H.R. 2 becomes law as it passed the Senate 
          with respect to the use of peyote in 
          religious ceremonies. 
          We have been advised by a representative of 
          the North [sic Native] American Church that 
          this church is a bona fide religious 
          organization and that peyote has bona fide 
          use in the sacrament of the church.  The 
          representative has agreed to document both of 
          these statements. 
          If the church is a bona fide religious 
          organization that makes sacramental use of 
          peyote, then it would be our view that H.R.

Attorney General in 1966, adopted a regulation effectuating Congress' 

intent. [footnote 37]  In 1970, when Congress passed the CSA, the BNDD 

assured Congress that a peyote use exemption would be carried forward by 

regulation. [footnote 38]  After the passage of the CSA,

          appeared in the House-passed version, could 
          not forbid bona fide religious use of peyote. 
          We believe that the constitutional guarantee 
          of religious freedom fully safeguards the 
          rights of the organization and its 
          communicants.

                         Commissioner of Food and Drugs 
     Mr. Speaker, in view of the foregoing, I recommend that 
     the House agree to the Senate amendments to H.R. 2. 
111 Cong.  Rec. 15,977-78 (1965).  Shortly after these remarks were 
concluded, the House concurred in the Senate amendments.  Amicus

for the Chief Counsel, DEA, December 22, 1981) (footnote omitted).

     Mr. [Congressman] Satterfield.  I have one other 
     question.  I recall when we were discussing dangerous 
     drugs a few years ago, the question came up about the 
     Native American Church involving Indians in the west 
     who use and have for centuries used peyote in 
     connection with religious services.  It is my 
     understanding that they enjoy an exemption under the 
     current law. 
     My question is whether in any of the bills we have 
     before us, if passed, would in any way affect this 
     present exemption?

the BNDD promulgated the current regulation which provides: 

          SPECIAL EXEMPT PERSONS 
          &#167; 1307.31 Native American Church. 
          The listing of peyote as a controlled 
          substance in Schedule I does not apply to the 
          nondrug use of peyote in bona fide religious 
          ceremonies of the Native American Church, and 
          members of the Native American Church so 
          using peyote are exempt from registration. 
          Any person who manufactures peyote for or 
          distributes peyote to the Native American 
          Church, however, is required to obtain 
          registration annually and to comply with all 
          other requirements of law. [footnote 39] 
____________________

     In the first instance, Mr. Satterfield, the Native 
     American Church did ask us by letter as to whether or 
     not the regulation, exempting them by regulation, would 
     be continued and we assured them that it would because 
     of the history of the church.  We presently are 
     involved in another hearing regarding another church 
     that is a non-Indian church that is seeking the 
     exemption and the order is going to be published, I 
     believe, either today or tomorrow denying them the same 
     exemption as the Native American Church. 
     We consider the Native American Church to be sui generis. 
     The history and tradition of the church is such that there 
     is no question but that they regard peyote as a deity as it 
     were, and we'll continue the exemption. 
     Mr. Satterfield.  You do not see anything in the Senate 
     bill that would make this impossible? 
     Mr. Sonnenreich.  No.  Under the existing law 
     originally the Congress was going to write in a 
     specific exemption but it was then decided that it 
     would be handled by regulation and we intend to do it 
     the same way under this law. 
     Mr. Satterfield.  Thank you.  I have no other 
     questions.

II.  THE ETHIOPIAN ZION COPTIC CHURCH IS A BONA FIDE RELIGION 
     AND MARIJUANA IS CENTRAL TO ITS WORSHIP 

     The EZCC, which traces its origins back 6,000 years, is 

headquartered in Jamaica. [footnote 40]  By the end of the Sixties, the 

Church had received a number of visitors from the U.S. and began allowing 

Caucasians to join the Church. [fotnote 41]  As a result, priests and 

members of the Church began to travel back and forth between the U.S. and 

Jamaica, and a number of U.S. citizens became members and priests in the 

Church. [footnote 42]  The Church was incorporated in 1976 and purchased 

a 1,000 acre farm in White Horse, St Thomas parish, Jamaica. [footnote 

43]  In addition, the Church purchased a residence for its members at 

Star Island in Miami, Florida. [footnote 44] 

     Church members consider themselves the historical and spiritual 

descendants of the Israelites of the Old Testament. [footnote 45]

Because of the constraints of slavery, however, the Church's written 

history did not evolve and does not compare with the organizational 

identity enjoyed by some Caucasian religions. [footnote 46]  Nonetheless, 

the Church is understood to be a Christian religion with Jesus as its 

primary prophet. [footnote 47]  The Church reveres the Bible as its holy 

book, and members adhere to traditions set forth in the Old Testament 

regarding diet, dress, grooming, sexual conduct, and so forth. [footnote

     &quot;The Church historically has been extremely restrictive in its

sanctions and sometimes expulsion. [footnote 50] 

     The EZCC traces its use of marijuana [footnote 51] to the Bible, 

citing passages regarding herbs, smoke, and clouds, [footnote 52] and 

stating that 

     &quot;marijuana is the [e)ucharistic spiritual body and 
     blood of Christ,&quot; and &quot;[o]nly through the sacramental 
     use of marijuana--combined with prayer and spiritual 
     reasoning among the brethren--can members of the Church 
     come to know God within themselves and within 
     others.&quot; [footnote 53] 

The non-drug use of marijuana is allowed at any point during the day, but 

is most commonly ingested during the three daily prayer

     [footnote 50]  Id. 

     [footnote 51]  The EZCC's longstanding religious tradition of 
marijuana ingestion may have a history that dates back further than the 
Native American use of peyote.  Some authors postulate that many Indian 
religions did not incorporate the peyote ritual into their religious 
practices until the 1920s and 30s.  See A. Marriott, supra note 9, at 78-
79; see also Amicus Memorandum Before DEA, July 1988, at 34 (citing W. La 
Barre, The Peyote Cult 110-23 (4th ed. 1975)). 

     [footnote 52]  Id. at 14.  The EZCC has compiled works of 
scholarship and ancient references which substantiate and detail the 
religious use of marijuana from time immemorial.  See Amicus Memorandum 
Before DEA, July 1988, App. 6.  For instance, The Book of Grass 11-12 (G.  
Andrews &amp; S. Vinkenoog ed. 1967), is cited for a passage on ancient 
Scythia and Iran by Mircea Eliade: 
     only one document appears to indicate the existence of 
     a Getic shamanism: It is Strabols account of the 
     Mysian KAPNOBATAI, a name that has been translated, by 
     analogy with Aristophanes' AEROBATES, as 'those who 
     walk in clouds', but which should be translated as 
     'those who walk in smoke'.  Presumably the smoke is 
     hemp smoke, a rudimentary means of ecstasy known to 
     both the Thracians and the Scythians....&quot;

[footnote 55]  Church members state that their ingestion of marijuana 

during worship does not result in any side-effects [footnote 56] or 

intoxication, nor is that a desirable goal. 

     The Church not only does not encourage but in fact 
     absolutely forbids the recreational use of marijuana 
     for the purpose of achieving intoxification.  The 
     Church believes that such intentional misuse of 
     marijuana, by members or nonmembers, constitutes 
     sacrilegious behavior.  Church members are strictly 
     prohibited from using any intoxication or addictive

III. THE ETHIOPIAN ZION COPTIC CHURCH REPEATEDLY PETITIONS BUT IS 
     DENIED A SACRAMENTAL DRUG EXEMPTION SIMILAR TO THAT 
     ACCORDED TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN CHURCH 

     A.  Olsen Proceeds Pro Se 

     From 1983 to 1985, Carl Eric Olsen, a member and priest of the EZCC, 

had repeated unilateral communications with the DEA attempting to procure 

for his Church a drug law exemption for the sacramental ingestion of 

marijuana. [footnote 61]  It was not until the

     SPECIAL EXEMPT CHURCH.  Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. 
     The listing of marijuana as a controlled substance in 
     Schedule I does not apply to the non-drug use of 
     marijuana in bona fide religious ceremonies of the 
     Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church and members of the 
     Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church so using marijuana are 
     exempt from registration.  Any person who manufactures 
     marijuana for or distributes marijuana to the Ethiopian 
     Zion Coptic Church, however, is required to obtain

District of Columbia federal district court issued a show cause order to 

the DEA in response to Olsen's writ of mandamus filed in 1986, that the 

DEA finally responded. [footnote 62]  John C. Lawn, the DEA 

Administrator, answered Olsen's requests in the form of a three paragraph 

letter which stated in part: 

          In 1984, an estimated 7,800 to 9,200 metric tons 
     of marijuana were illegally consumed in the United 
     States.  It has been estimated that over 20 million 
     people in the United States use marijuana on a regular 
     basis.  Marijuana abuse is a major public health 
     problem in this country.  Accordingly, the 
     investigation and prosecution of marijuana traffickers, 
     the interdiction of marijuana smuggling and the 
     eradication of the drug at its source continue to be 
     major concerns of drug law enforcement both 
     domestically and internationally. 

          In view of the immensity of the marijuana abuse 
     problem in the United States and the magnitude of the 
     criminal activity surrounding the production and 
     trafficking in this substance, the Administrator of the 
     Drug Enforcement Administration concludes that the 
     interest of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church in the 
     ceremonial use of marijuana is outweighed by the 
     compelling governmental interest in controlling the use 
     and illegal distribution of marijuana in the United 
     States. [footnote 63] 

     The district court dismissed Olsen's mandamus petition as moot; 

appealing the dismissal, Olsen stated, &quot;The DEA gave no reasons at all 

for denying the exemption, the DEA only gave 
_______________ 

     registration annually and to comply with all other 
     requirements of law. 
Id.  App. 13, 16, 18. 

     [footnote 62]  Id. App. 2-4.  Olsen also had filed a mandamus 
petition in the Eleventh Circuit.  Olsen v. DEA, 776 F.2d 267 (llth Cir. 
1985) (affirming district court's denial of olsen's request for a 
mandamus to compel DEA to respond to petitions for marijuana exemption 
because the statute authorizing exemptions does not provide for a 
religious exemption).

reasons for denying marijuana use to the general public. [footnote 64] 

Olsen also appealed the DEA's denial, admitting that the DEA had a 

compelling interest in the overall enforcement of the CSA, but arguing 

that the exemption granted to the NAC had not undermined that interest 

nor would a limited exemption for the EZCC. [footnote 65]  Olsen pointed 

out that the DEA previously denied a peyote exemption to the Church of 

the Awakening (&quot;CotA&quot;), after finding that the CotA was not similar to 

the NAC because &quot;peyote is essential and central to the [NAC] religion in 

that without peyote their religion would not and could not exist.&quot; 

[footnote 66]  The DEA made no such findings regarding the EZCC denial. 

[footnote 67] 

     In its response, the government set forth the three-part test from 

United States v. Lee, [footnote 68] for establishing a free exercise 

claim [footnote 69] and cited various free exercise cases. [footnote 70]

decision to the Ninth Circuit.  Kennedy v. BNDD, 459 F.2d 415 (9th Cir.

Admittedly, the federal and state peyote exemptions tend to negate the 

existence of a compelling government interest in prohibiting its non-drug 

use in bona fide religious worship. [footnote 71]  Thus, the government 

tried to distinguish the NAC, stating that Congressional testimony 

presented by the director of the BNDD during the CSA hearings indicated 

that the NAC was considered 

     sui generis.  The history and tradition of the church 
     is such that there is no question but that they regard 
     peyote as a deity. [footnote 72] 

By contrast, the EZCC &quot;does not have such a Congressional recognition of 

its status.&quot; [footnote 73] 

     Olsen replied with a discussion of the key case regarding the 

sacramental use of marijuana, Leary v. United States. [footnote 74] 

Timothy Leary and his daughter were found in possession of marijuana upon 

their re-entry into this country by car from Mexico. [footnote 75]

Leary court continued: 

     The exemption accorded the use of peyote in the limited 
     bona fide religious ceremonies of the relatively small, 
     unknown Native American Church is clearly 
     distinguishable from the private and personal use of 
     marijuana by any person who claims he is using it as a 
     religious practice. [footnote 84] 

     B.  Amicus is Appointed to Represent Olsen 

     The Court of Appeals appointed amicus curiae for Olsen. [footnote 

85]  Amicus filed a brief discussing other marijuana exemptions extended 

by the federal government. [footnote 86]  Since the late 1960s, the 

government has been involved in growing, processing, and distributing 

marijuana to registered persons and entities. [footnote 87]  That program 

is administered by the National institute on Drug Abuse (&quot;NIDA&quot;), which 

has contracted with the University of Mississippi to grow marijuana; NIDA

A number of marijuana exemptions have been issued to state governments 

which supervise local distribution of NIDA marijuana primarily for use in 

programs to lessen the negative side-effects of chemotherapy and to treat 

glaucoma. [footnote 89]  In the years between 1978 and 1987, NIDA has 

authorized and overseen the distribution of 477,507 cigarettes for human 

consumption. [footnote 90]  &quot;(Clearly,] some limited level of marijuana 

use is not inconsistent with the government's&quot; goals. [footnote 91] 

     C.  Remand to the DEA 

     The government petitioned the court of appeals to remand the case to 

the DEA so that it could &quot;explain more fully the basis for its 

dDecision.&quot; [footnote 92]  The court denied the motion; then, changing 

its mind six days later, the court issued an order remanding the case to 

the DEA. [footnote 93]

the DEA wherein Olsen withdrew the language of his prior exemption 

[footnote 94] and proposed the following exemption: 

     1.  [EZCC] members would be restricted to using 
     marijuana during their Saturday evening prayer 
     ceremony, which lasts from 8:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m.; 

     2.  During that ceremony, and for the eight hours 
     following that ceremony, Church members would not leave 
     the place where the ceremony is conducted; they would 
     not drive automobiles or otherwise go out in public; 

     3.  Ingestion of marijuana would be limited to Church 
     members who had reached the age of majority, according 
     to the laws of the state in which the ceremony takes 
     place; and 

     4.  Ingestion of marijuana would be limited to full 
     Church members who had undergone the confession 
     ritual [footnote 95] for entering the Church's 
     community. [footnote 96] 

     Turning to the substantive arguments, Amicus stated that contrary to 

the position espoused by the government, the legislative history of the 

American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (&quot;AIRFA&quot;), [footnote 97] 

did not support the argument that Congress

Congress recognized that preferential treatment of the NAC would run

statements were reported: 
     The clear intent of this section is to insure for 
     traditional native religions the same rights of free 
     exercise enjoyed by more powerful religions.  However, 
     it is in no way intended to provide Indian religions 
     with a more favorable status than other religions, only

Other pertinent statements include: 
     [D]irect Federal interference in the religious 
     ceremonies imposes upon one religion, by Government 
     action, the values of another.  Such action is a direct 
     threat to the foundation of religious freedom in

response, the Senate redrafted its resolution to make &quot;absolutely clear 

that AIRFA directed government agencies simply to ensure that Indian 

religions enjoyed the same guarantee of 'freedom of religion for all 

people' that is required by the First Amendment.&quot; [footnote 100]  When 

the Department of Justice informed the administration that it did not 

object to the President's signing of AIRFA, it made specific mention of 

the fact that Congress had incorporated the Department of Justice's 

position that a preference for Native American religions could not be 

extended without violating the establishment clause. [footnote 101] 

Furthermore, DEA attorneys concurred in the remarks made by the Justice 

Department, writing, in a memo commenting on the Justice Department's 

position, that &quot;no line can be drawn between religions claiming a bona 

fide use of drugs.&quot; [footnote 102]  In 1981, the office of Legal Counsel 

(&quot;OLC&quot;), published a memorandum opinion for the Chief Counsel of the DEA, 

stating that &quot;Indian religion cannot be treated differently than other 

religions similarly situated without violation of the Establishment 

Clause.&quot; [footnote 97]

     Finally, Amicus seriously questioned whether a first amendment claim 

could be denied on the basis of health concerns. [footnote 104]  The 

&quot;agency's sanctioning of marijuana use by hundreds of persons involved in 

registered medical and research programs strongly suggests that marijuana 

use is not in all instances detrimental to an individuals health and

the peyote exemption undermined public respect for the CSA. [footnote

     not stem from the unique features of Indian religion or 
     culture.  With respect to these matters, Indians stand 
     on no different footing than do other minorities in our 
     pluralistic society.  Rather, the special treatment of 
     Indians is grounded in their unique status as political 
     entities, formerly sovereign nations preexisting the 
     Constitution, which still retain a measure of inherent 
     sovereignty over their peoples unless divested by 
     federal statute or by necessary implication of their 
     dependent status. 
     An exemption for Indian religious use of peyote would 
     not be grounded in the unique political status of 
     Indians.  Instead, the exemption would be based on the 
     special culture and religion of the Indians.  In this 
     respect, Indian religion cannot be treated differently 
     than other religions similarly situated without 
     violation of the Establishment Clause.

     The government responded to Olsen's proposed EZCC exemption 

by stating that: 

     such restrictions could not be monitored or enforced 
     without significant intrusion by the Government into 
     the religious practices of the Church.  The monitoring 
     of such restrictions would be extremely burdensome on 
     an agency which is charged with enforcement of a very 
     comprehensive drug law. [footnote 107] 

     D.  The DEA Denies the Exemption 

     In a nine page decision, John Lawn denied the EZCC an exemption for 

the religious use of marijuana. [footnote 108]  Citing Leary, [footnote 

109] in addition to other cases, [footnote 110] the Administrator 

asserted that the EZCC had no free exercise right to use marijuana; 

moreover, it did not enjoy an &quot;equal protection&quot; right to an exemption 

because the EZCC &quot;advocates the continuous use of marijuana or 'ganja', 

while the Native American Church's use of

peyote is isolated to specific ceremonial occasions.&quot; [footnote 111]  The 

Administrator further distinguished marijuana from peyote stating that 

&quot;the actual abuse and availability of marijuana in the United States is 

many times more pervasive in American society than that of peyote.&quot; 

[footnote 112]  Substantiating this claim, the Administrator stated that 

between 1980 and 1987, the DEA seized 19.4 pounds of peyote as compared 

to 15,302,468.7 pounds of marijuana. [footnote 113] 

     This overwhelming difference explains why an 
     accommodation can be made for a religious organization 
     which uses peyote in circumscribed ceremonies, and not 
     for a religion which espouses continual use of 
     marijuana.  The Administrator also notes that Mr. 
     Olsen's conviction in United States v. Rush involved 
     the illegal importation of 20 tons of marijuana....  If 
     Mr. Olsen's assertions that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic 
     Church in the United States has never had, &quot;more than 
     between 100 and 200 members in this country,&quot; 20 tons 
     of marijuana would be an outrageous quantity to supply 
     their religious needs. [footnote 114] 

     Specifically addressing olsen's proposed exemption, the 

Administrator determined that the large quantity of marijuana in this 

country would make monitoring compliance very difficult and would make 

accommodation impractical. [footnote 115]  Olsen challenged the

DEA's final order, requesting review by the court of appeals. [footnote

     E.  The Court of Appeals Denies the Exemption 

     1.  The Majority 

     In June of 1989, the court of appeals, over a strongly worded 

dissent by Judge Buckley, denied Olsen both a free exercise right and an 

&quot;equal protection-establishment clause&quot; right to a religious-use 

exemption. [footnote 117]  Regarding Olsen's proposal, the majority found 

that because EZCC members were allowed to use marijuana &quot;every day 

throughout the day,&quot; the proposal would not be &quot;self-enforcing&quot; and would 

require &quot;burdensome and constant official supervision and management.&quot; 

[footnote 118]  Concerned with the EZCC's lack of stringent control over 

the sacramental use of marijuana in the past, the court noted that the

marijuana exemption would violate both the establishment clause and the

case was argued before Circuit Judges Bader Ginsburg, Silberman, and 
Buckley.  Amicus was asked if he knew of any decisions where courts had 
held that the free exercise clause required government accommodation of 
religiously motivated conduct despite the government's position that 
accommodation posed a significant health risk.  In a subsequent letter to 
the court, counsel cited cases wherein people had been allowed to refuse 
medical treatment for religious reasons despite the state interest in 
preserving the health of	or even the life of the individual.  Amicus 
Letter to Court, Feb. 13, 1989, at 1-2.  In addition, Amicus cited the 
line of cases where state courts had found that a free exercise exemption

&quot;establishment clause-equal protection challenge,&quot; the court accorded 

great deference to the DEA and found that the EZCC is not similarly 

situated to the NAC, [footnote 120] because of the vast differences 

between peyote and marijuana regarding their demand, abuse, and 

availability. [footnote 121]  Resting its decision upon the &quot;immensity of 

the marijuana control problem in the United States,&quot; the court refused to 

find an establishment clause violation and pointed out additional 

distinctions between the two religions: 

     1)  The peyote ritual is a traditional, precisely 
         circumscribed ritual; 

     2)  Peyote is itself an object of worship; 

     3)  Use of peyote outside of the ritual is sacrilegious 
         for the NAC; and 

     4)  The NAC, for all practical purposes other than the 
         special stylized ceremony, reinforces the state's

The sharp contrast between the NAC and the EZCC was further evidenced by 

Olsen's statement that marijuana is smoked continually &quot;through 

everything that we do.&quot; [footnote 123]  Again reviewing Olsen's proposed 

exemption, the court cryptically concluded that &quot;'narrow' use, 

concededly, is not his religion's tradition.&quot; [footnote 124] 

     2.  Judge Buckley's Dissent 

     Judge Buckley dissented &quot;because the majority fail[ed] to address

DEA's explanation fell &quot;far short&quot; of meeting the strict scrutiny 

standard. [footnote 128] 

     In fact, Judge Buckley found the DEA's reasoning to be extremely 

superficial in light of the Supreme Court decision of Larson v. Valente. 

[footnote 129]  In Larson, religious denominations in Minnesota receiving 

more than fifty percent of their funds from members and affiliated 

organizations were not required to comply with registration and reporting 

laws regarding their fund raising activities. [footnote 130]  This 

statute had the effect of granting a denominational preference to well-

established churches, and the Court applied strict scrutiny to 

Minnesota's well reasoned 
____________________

in view of the denominational preference, the majority relied on an equal 
protection analysis.  Id. at 1463-64 &amp; n.5.  The majority cited Walz v. 
Tax Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664, 694, 696 (1970), for this proposition and Judge 
Buckley acknowledged that this analysis had been mentioned in a 
concurring opinion by Justice Frankfurter in Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 
U.S. 67, 70 (1953).  878 F.2d at 1463 n.5, 1468.  However, both of these 
cases involved laws which applied equally to all religions.  The Walz 
Court examined the New York tax exemption law for religious, educational, 
or charitable uses, 397 U.S. at 666-67, while the Court in Fowler 
reviewed the constitutionality of a law that prohibited all religious 
meetings in any public park in Rhode Island.  345 U.S. at 67.  The Larson 
Court found this distinction critical, stating that the Lemon test 
applied to &quot;laws affording a uniform benefit to all religions,&quot; while a 
law that discriminates among religions must &quot;be invalidated unless it is 
justified by a compelling governmental interest and unless it is closely 
fitted to further that interest.&quot;  Larson, 456 U.S. at 246-47, 252 
(citations omitted).  Indeed, the Court in Gillette v. United States, 401

cases, equal protection is not an independent argument.  Id. at 449 n.14.

explanations as to how its registration and reporting exemption was 

closely fitted to furthering a compelling state interest. [footnote 131] 

While the Supreme Court agreed that Minnesota had a compelling state 

interest in protecting its citizens from abusive solicitation practices, 

it found that Minnesota had not demonstrated that the exemption was 

necessary to further that interest nor that the exemption was closely 

fitted to furthering the interest. [footnote 132]  Finding that the 

statutory exemption failed to pass a strict scrutiny analysis, the 

Supreme Court extended it to the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon, 

holding that any bona fide religion would qualify for the exemption. 

[footnote 133] 

     Addressing the DEA's argument that the two religions warranted 

different treatment because of: 1) their differing sacramental drug use 

rituals; and 2) the different law enforcement problems vis a vis the two 

drugs, Judge Buckley asserted that Olsen's proposed exemption effectively 

eliminated the first distinction. [footnote 134]  Additionally, Judge 

Buckley challenged the DEA's argument that the abuse and availability of 

marijuana justified the disparate treatment:

not certain that extension rather than invalidation of the exemption was 
proper.  878 F.2d at 1464.  Judge Buckley retorted that such indecision 
could not excuse the court from properly reviewing an underinclusive 
statute.  Id. at 1471.

     The government's interest in preventing abuse of a 
     given drug is not proportional to the drug's 
     prevalence.  By classifying both marijuana and peyote 
     as Schedule I controlled substances, Congress has 
     determined that the federal government has a compelling 
     interest in preventing the illegal distribution and use 
     of both drugs. [footnote 135] 

     Noting that the DEA had no difficulty monitoring compliance of more 

than 250,000 members of the NAC, Judge Buckley questioned the DEA's lack 

of solid reasoning why monitoring compliance of one-hundred to two-

hundred EZCC members would be so impossible. [footnote 136]  Indeed, the 

exemption would place no restrictions on the DEA's normal enforcement 

operations other than at the church for a limited number of hours once a 

week. [footnote 137]  Judge Buckley stated that he would remand the case 

to the DEA so that it could more adequately review and address Olsen's 

establishment claim. [footnote 138]

Suggestion For Rehearing En Banc. [footnote 139]  The Supreme Court

IV.  THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION 

     The establishment clause prohibits both the state and federal 

government from passing laws which prefer one religion over another. 

[footnote 141]  Whether one adheres to the &quot;broad&quot; interpretation of the 

establishment clause or the &quot;narrower&quot; interpretation, all scholars agree 

that the establishment clause was meant by the framers to prevent the 

government from bestowing a preference on one religion; [footnote 142] 

and, as such, to protect the &quot;small, new, or unpopular denominations&quot; 

[footnote 143] from &quot;subtle departures from neutrality, 'religious 

gerrymanders,' as well as

&quot;denominational preference&quot; is conferred by governmental action.  Amicus 
Certiorari Petition, Dec. 13, 1989, at 9-14 (citing Larson v. Valente,

the definition of &quot;denominational preference&quot; was arising, and courts 
needed guidance on when strict scrutiny should be applied.  Id. at 15-22. 
     In response, the government asserted that no free exercise, 
establishment, or equal protection rights had been violated because

equally to all bona fide religious groups.&quot;  Respondent's Opposition To 
Petition For Writ Of Certiorari, Feb. 1990, at 9.  As a result, no 
denominational preference was created and the Lemon test as opposed to 
strict scrutiny was applicable.  Id. at 10.  Moreover, the government 
argued that the DEA's &quot;considered professional judgment&quot; concerning the 
burden of monitoring the exemption should not be questioned.  Id. at 12.

obvious abuses. [footnote 144]  The EZCC is small, new to this country, 

and unpopular. [footnote 145]  As a result, the EZCC has been denied even 

the narrowest exemption for its sacrament while the NAC enjoys an 

unlimited exemption for peyote. 

     A.  Comparing The Two Exemptions 

     The majority stated that Olsen had proposed an exemption identical 

to the one accorded to the NAC. [footnote 146]  This is not true. 

Olsen's proposed exemption is very narrow, restricting the sacramental 

use of marijuana to three hours, one day per week. [footnote 147]  The 

exemption states that once the three hour worship service has finished, 

members may not leave the place where the ceremony was conducted for 

eight additional hours.  The exemption specifically prohibits members 

from driving or going out in public during that post-worship period. 

Only EZCC members who are of the age of majority may participate in the 

service and &quot;membership&quot; is

     [footnote 145]  The total denial of an exemption to the EZCC has had 
tragic results for the members.  The EZCC has publicly stated: 
     Through ... the police force, the church has been 
     severely harassed, victimized and discriminated 
     against.  Our members have passed through several acts 
     of police brutality, our legal properties maliciously 
     destroyed, members falsely imprisoned, divine services 
     broken up, and all these atrocities performed upon the 
     Church, under the name of political laws and their 
     justice.

explained, the free exercise clause and the establishment clause work in 
close conjunction, the guarantees of one reinforcing the guarantees of 
the other.  Larson, 456 U.S. at 244-45.

strictly construed. [footnote 148] 

     While the majority described the NAC exemption as &quot;tightly-cabined,&quot; 

[footnote 149] nothing could be further from the truth.  The NAC 

exemption is unlimited; it states that &quot;Schedule I does not apply to the 

nondrug use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native 

American Church.&quot; [footnote 150]  The only benefit strictly limited to 

&quot;members&quot; is a waiver of the registration requirement if the member 

manufactures or distributes peyote to the NAC. [footnote 151]  Other than 

that, the exemption does not limit participation in the peyote ceremony 

to church members or people of majority, nor does it restrict driving or 

even suggest a detoxification period.  Given the lack of any consensus on 

the meaning of &quot;Native American Church,&quot; either among Native Americans or 

by those outside of the Church, and the widely diverging views on how the 

religious ceremony is to be conducted, [footnote 152] the peyote 

exemption is very broad, indeed. 

     The majority was quite concerned with how rigidly membership was 

enforced in the EZCC and whether membership was required before one was 

allowed to participate in the sacrament. [footnote 153]  But the majority

monitoring burden the DEA states would accompany the EZCC exemption.  In 

addition, it simply defies logic that a church with a membership of 

250,000 to 300,000 people would be easier to monitor than a church with a 

membership of one-hundred to two-hundred people.  Olsen agreed to provide 

a list of member names and places of worship.  Under the NAC exemption, 

however, the DEA has no idea where or when ceremonies will take place or 

who will be participating.  This would appear to make monitoring 

exponentially more difficult.  Nonetheless, monitoring the NAC exemption, 

apparently, has not imposed a burden on the DEA.  Nor does it seem likely 

that monitoring the limited EZCC exemption would be significant. 

     C.  Comparing the Churches' Rituals 

     The NAC ritual which involves an all night service perhaps once a 

week, [footnote 168] is more acceptable in the court's view than the EZCC 

ritual which traditionally is a daily observance.  The majority's concern 

about the EZCC's regular use of its sacrament seems to state a clear 

preference for religions that engage sparingly in the use of their 

sacrament. [footnote 169]  The Catholic Church offers the holy sacrament 

for ingestion at every worship service (mass), and members are free to 

engage in worship on a daily

basis, if not more. [footnote 170]  On the other hand, many Protestant 

denominations offer the holy sacrament once a month, or less. [footnote 

171]  Speaking in terms of one's religious tradition, how often one 

partakes of holy communion should not be a basis upon which one church 

receives an exemption and another church does not.  The EZCC ritual is 

more akin to the lifestyle of a religious order living in community where 

communion might be celebrated at various times throughout the day.  The 

majority found it significant that EZCC members were allowed to ingest 

their sacrament outside of the confines of the church facility.

[footnote 172]  This concern again seems to be placing an unfair premium 

on certain types of rituals.  The Protestant and Catholic Churches of 

America celebrate and distribute their sacrament in shopping malls,

the sacrament cannot be celebrated.  Furthermore, finding it significant 

that ingestion of the sacrament be limited to the confines of a &quot;church 

facility&quot; appears suspect when it is not at all clear that the NAC even 

has the functional equivalent of a &quot;church facility.&quot; [footnote 179] 

     The majority dispensed with Olsen's proposed exemption by stating 

that &quot;'narrow' use, concededly, is not his religion's tradition.&quot; 

[footnote 180]  The court cannot in good faith use the tradition of the 

EZCC as a basis for suggesting that the exemption will not be adhered to. 

Whether an exemption tracks a religious tradition or not is irrelevant, 

has never been the law, and should not be used to circumvent a religious 

group's proposal to compromise.  Accepting the EZCC's offer to modify its 

traditions rather than resorting to total ban on the religion's sacrament 

would seem to serve the government's best interest.  Given the choice 

between an unlimited drug exemption for a church which is loosely knit 

together with few checks on behavior [footnote 181] and a narrowly drawn 

exemption which incorporates many checks on behavior for a church that 

nonetheless has not traditionally restricted its sacrament, the latter 

seems preferable.

     The majority noted &quot;further distinctions&quot; between the rituals of the 

two religions: 

     1) the peyote exemption was accorded for a traditional, 
     precisely circumscribed ritual; 

     2) peyote is an object of worship; 

     3) for the NAC, use of peyote outside of the ritual is 
     sacrilegious; and 

     4) the NAC, for all practical purposes, &quot;reinforces&quot; 
     the state's prohibition. [footnote 182] 

First, marijuana is a traditional ritual for the EZCC. [footnote 183] 

Moreover, the NAC's &quot;precisely circumscribed ritual&quot; lasts at least 

twelve hours, while the EZCC proposal would limit the service to three 

hours. [footnote 184]  The peyote ceremony has myriad manifestations, and 

there is no prohibition on how often one might participate in a NAC 

ceremony--while Olsen has limited participation in the EZCC sacrament to 

one night per week, and it is always the same night. [footnote 185] 

Second, the DEA has conceded in its briefs that marijuana for the EZCC is 

an object of worship. [footnote 186]  Third, for the EZCC, use of 

marijuana outside of the ritual is sacrilegious: &quot;The

Church believes that [recreational use] of marijuana, by members or 

nonmembers, constitutes sacrilegious behavior.&quot; [footnote 187]  Even 

during the ceremony, those ingesting marijuana do not inhale the smoke 

into their lungs; they avoid its intoxicating effects by taking it into 

their mouths and exhaling it from their noses.&quot; [footnote 188]  Finally, 

the EZCC religion, for all practical purposes, reinforces the state's 

prohibitions.  The members of the EZCC do not approve of drug abuse in 

any form, and alcohol is strictly forbidden.&quot; [footnote 189]  Indeed, all 

aspects of conduct are strictly regulated by a literal interpretation of 

the Old Testament. [footnote 190]  Thus, the differences noted by the 

majority are instead distinct similarities between the two churches. 

     D.  Comparison of the Drugs 

     Both peyote and marijuana are Schedule I drugs which means that they 

both: 1) have a high potential for abuse; 2) have no currently accepted 

medical use in treatment; and 3) lack of accepted safety for use under 

medical supervision. [footnote 191]  The only argument that can be made 

that these drugs are not similarly situated in terms of the government's 

definition regarding dangerous drugs, is that marijuana does not even 

meet the second

Native American culture, including the native religion, is federal

romantic affinity for the Native Americans is clear and is explicitly

V.   CONCLUSION 

     Congress and the DEA have accorded a sacramental drug exemption to 

Native Americans regarding peyote. [footnote 202]  The EZCC has tried for 

years to obtain a similar exemption regarding marijuana. [footnote 203] 

This past June, the Supreme Court denied certiorari to the District of 

Columbia Court of Appeals decision denying the EZCC a sacramental drug 

exemption similar to that held by the NAC. [footnote 204] 

     The court of appeals decision to deny an exemption to the EZCC 

violates the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution. [footnote 

205]  The court's reliance on the DEA's statement that it has greater law 

enforcement control problems with marijuana will not satisfy an 

application of strict scrutiny.  The DEA must explain why a very narrow 

exemption extended to one-hundred to two-hundred people would undermine 

its interest in preventing drug abuse when an unlimited exemption for 

peyote extended to 300,000 to 400,000 people does not. [footnote 206] 

Additionally, there must be a forthright analysis of the current trends 

regarding the public's abuse of marijuana and the growing body of

information concerning marijuana's use for medicinal purposes. [footnote 

207] 

     The court set forth various aspects of the NAC which made it 

particularly well suited for an exemption, and then failed to recognize 

that the EZCC has demonstrated significant similarity to the NAC 

regarding these aspects. [footnote 208]  For example, the EZCC views the 

recreational use of its sacrament as sacrilegious, has much stricter 

controls on its membership, and regards marijuana as a deity as does the 

NAC concerning peyote. [footnote 209]  Additionally, as a result of its 

proposed exemption, the EZCC would exercise much greater control over its 

ceremony than the NAC. [footnote 210] 

     The EZCC is being denied a benefit accorded to another church 

because of its ritual, its traditions, because it is not indigenous, and 

because of the abuse of its sacrament by others.  The EZCC has proposed 

to modify its tradition and ritual, to adhere to practices which are much 

more restrictive than those of the NAC, and to help with monitoring 

problems, to no avail. [footnote 211]  The reasons for the denial appear 

to flow from the fact that the EZCC is a relatively new religion to this 

country, of black origins, small, and unpopular. [footnote 212]  The 

establishment clause was specifically written to protect these very types 

of religions

<BR><DD>On May 25, 1994, an indictment by The Riverside County Grand
Jury was filed charging appellant with transporting, importing, selling,
furnishing, giving away, or offering to transport, import, sell, furnish,
administer, give away or attempting to import or transport more than 28.5
grams of marijuana.&nbsp; (Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11360, subd. (a); count one.)&nbsp; Appellant was also charged with possession of marijuana for sale.&nbsp; (Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11359; count two.)&nbsp; (CT 1-2.)
<DD>On April 11, 1995, appellant waived jury trial and proceeded by way of a court trial.&nbsp; (CF 219.)&nbsp; On May 19, appellant was found guilty on both counts.&nbsp; (CT 266.)
<DD>On July 10, 1995, appellant was granted five years probation.&nbsp; Among the terms and conditions of probation imposed, appellant was required to serve 240 days in jail, not to possess or use any controlled substances unless medically prescribed, and not to associate with any unrelated person known to be a possessor, user, or trafficker of controlled substances.&nbsp; (CT 271.)&nbsp; That same day, appellant filed his notice of appeal.&nbsp; (CT 273A.)

<BR>
<CENTER><B><U><A NAME="FACTS">STATEMENT OF FACTS</A></U></B></CENTER><BR>
<DD>On March 27, 1994, appellant was driving his BMW through the Temecula
border patrol checkpoint when he was stopped at the primary inspection
area.&nbsp; (CT 19-26<SMALL><SUP><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#1"><U>1</U></A>/</SUP></SMALL>.)&nbsp; Appellant's BMW was directed to the secondary inspection area where a canine sniff was conducted.&nbsp; (CT 19-21.)&nbsp; The dog alerted to the presence of contraband.&nbsp; (CT 22.)
<DD>Appellant initially refused to provide the border patrol agents the keys to his trunk, but then relented.&nbsp; (CT 23.)&nbsp; Inside the trunk, the agents found two duffle bags containing a total of 40 one-pound packages of marijuana.&nbsp; (CT 23-24.)
<DD>Appellant told the agents he was coming front the Alpine area of San Diego County.&nbsp; (CT 26.)&nbsp; Rolling papers were found on appellant's person, and $2,350 was found under the dashcover inside the BMW.&nbsp; (CT 27, 39.)&nbsp; After appellant was given his <I>Miranda</I><SMALL><SUP><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#2"><U>2</U></A>/</SUP></SMALL> rights, he spontaneously told Joel Ontiveros, a sheriff's investigator, that the passenger in his car, Bret Corey Mixcel, wasn't involved with the &quot;stuff&quot; in his car, that it was all &quot;my stuff [i.e., appellant's].&quot; (CT 30, 35, 37, 41.)
<DD>Sheriff's Investigator Ontiveros provided his expert opinion based on his training and experience that the 40 pounds of marijuana appellant was transporting was Mexican grown and was possessed for purposes of selling. (CT 41-42.)&nbsp; He estimated the wholesale value of the marijuana to be $40,000 and the retail value at $360,000 to $3.6 million dollars.&nbsp; (CT 43.)&nbsp; It was important to Ontiveros' opinion about appellant possessing the marijuana for sale that the marijuana was broken down into one-pound increments which makes re-sale easier.&nbsp; (CT 43-44.)
<DD>Appellant testified he is a priest of the Israel Zion Coptic Church; there are only 24 members of this church in the entire state of Wisconsin and they are the members of appellant's family and the family of his friend,
Michael Matteson.&nbsp; (RT 319-320, 326-327; CT 71, 114<SMALL><SUP><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#3"><U>3</U></A>/</SUP></SMALL>.)&nbsp; His church is incorporated in the state of Wisconsin.&nbsp; (CT 71, 114.)&nbsp; Appellant estimated the total membership of the Israel Zion Coptic Church from Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina and elsewhere (including men, women and children) as between 200-250 members.&nbsp; (CT 74.)&nbsp; The Israel Zion Coptic Church is an offshoot of the Rastafarian
movement and the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.&nbsp; (RT 334-342; CT 84.)&nbsp; The Israel Zion Coptic's doctrine incorporates the use of marijuana (referred to as &quot;ganja&quot;) as a sacrament used during religious services and gatherings.&nbsp; (CT 71-73, 114.)
<DD>Appellant was arrested in 1987 in Wisconsin for growing marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 392-393.)&nbsp; One of the conditions of his probation in Wisconsin was not to grow marijuana anymore.&nbsp; (RT 393-393.)&nbsp; Because of this probation condition, appellant decided to travel to San Diego to purchase
marijuana for the church's use.&nbsp; (RT 391-394.)&nbsp; About $30,000 was collected between appellant and two friends from Iowa to make the purchase.&nbsp; (RT 391, 349.)&nbsp; Appellant drove to San Diego and purchased the 40 pounds of marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 400-402.)&nbsp; He was stopped at the Temecula checkpoint while driving back to Wisconsin.<SMALL><SUP><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#4"><U>4</U></A>/</SUP></SMALL>

<DD>1.&nbsp; There was insufficient evidence to support a conviction of guilt based upon intent to sell madjuana.
<DD>2.&nbsp; The trial court cannot side-step the First Amendment freedom of religion issue on the basis that appellant's acts constituted a commercial activity.
<DD>3.&nbsp; The trial court cannot side-step the First Amendment issue and impose probation conditions which burden appellant's freedom of association and free exercise of religion.
<DD>4.&nbsp; Appellant's use of marijuana is protected by the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause.

<DD>1.&nbsp; Substantial evidence supports appellant's conviction on count two, possession of marijuana for sale.
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp; The lower court's findings.
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp; Analysis.
<DD>2.&nbsp; The trial court properly ruled appellant's act of transporting marijuana across state lines, some of which would go to individuals not connected with his church, constituted a commercial activity.
<DD>3.&nbsp; Appellant waived any objections to the terms and conditions of probation by not objecting to them at the time of sentencing.
<DD>4.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to reach the issue of whether appellant's use of marijuana is protected by the First Amendment's free exercise of religion clause; but if it is reached, appellant's argument should still be rejected. <DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp; California's marijuana laws are in furtherance of compelling
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;governmental interests.
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp; California's marijuana laws are the least restrictive means of
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;furthering the compelling state interests in public health and
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;safety.

<DD>Appellant argues there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction on count two, possession of marijuana for sale, in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11359.&nbsp; (AOB 5.)&nbsp; More specifically, appellant argues the evidence did not show he intended to sell the marijuana, but only to give it away as a sacrament in his church.&nbsp; (AOB 5.)&nbsp; Appellant's argument should be rejected for at least four reasons: (1) "sale" includes "non-cash benefits" and appellant was seeking to obtain the non-cash benefit of new adherents to his church in exchange for giving them marijuana; (2) appellant through his own testimony revealed he was to receive an additional amount of marijuana in-kind for his actions of purchasing and delivering these pounds of marijuana; (3) appellant has failed to rebut the inference, created by virtue of the large amount of marijuana he possessed, that the marijuana was possessed for sale; and (4) circumstantial evidence (regarding packaging, and appellant's possession of $2,350 in cash) led Sheriff's Investigator Joel Ontiveros to state his expert opinion that appellant possessed the marijuana for purposes of sale.
<DD>In considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the
appellate court must review the record in the light most favorable to the
judgment below to determine whether the record discloses substantial
evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; (<I>Jackson v. Virginia</I> (1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781]; <I>People v. Johnson</I> (1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578; <I>People v. Olguin</I> (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1382.)
<DD>Although the appellate court must ensure the evidence is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, it is the exclusive province of the trier of fact to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which the determination depends.&nbsp; (<I>People v. Barnes</I> (1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 303.)&nbsp; The appellate court must also draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence which support the trier of
fact's verdict.&nbsp; (<I>People v. Alcala</I> (1984) 36 Cal.3d 604, 623; <I>People v. Hernandez</I> (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1177, 1181.)&nbsp; The same standard applies where the People rely primarily on circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; (<I>People v. Perez</I> (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1117, 1124.)&nbsp; Although it is the trier of fact's duty to acquit a defendant if it finds the circumstantial evidence is susceptible of two interpretations, one which suggests guilt and the other innocence, it is the trier of fact, not the appellate court which must be convinced of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; "If the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact's findings, the opinion of the reviewing court that the circumstances might also be reasonably reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the judgment."&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; Thus, the relevant inquiry on appeal is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; (<I>Jackson v. Virginia</I>, <I>supra</I>, 443 U.S. at p. 319; <I>People v. Lucero</I> (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1006, 1020; <I>People v. Hernandez</I>, <I>supra</I>, 219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1182.)

<DD>At sentencing, the court made the following relevant comments with regards to count two, possession for sale of marijuana:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"[THE COURT]:&nbsp; I cannot stress how significant the Court found your testimony about the whole series of transactions and thought that went into the decision to leave the state of Wisconsin and its neighboring states and journey over a thousand miles to Southern California to acquire the marijuana which you were going to transport back.
<DD>".......................
<DD>"You are going to be punished in this case [not because of] your involvement with this drug as part of your religion ... but because of your involvement with this drug as part of a commerce of marijuana users.&nbsp; <U>The amount of 40 pounds, the sum of money of $28,000 are not insignificant amounts in the Court's eyes</U>, nor do I think in the eyes of the community.&nbsp; This doesn't look like just Gregory Peck trying to practice his religion.&nbsp; <U>This is Gregory Peck supplying others with marijuana at a particular price as part of the kind of money changing</U> that another revolutionary took offense to when he picked up a whip and drove the money changers from the temple.&nbsp; There are things that occur in a religious context that are not religious, and that's how I view the evidence in this case."&nbsp; (RT 533-535; emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><A NAME="IB">B</A>.&nbsp; <U>Analysis</U></B>
<P>
<DD>Appellant's argument there is insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of possession for sale of marijuana should be rejected for at least the following four reasons:
<DD>First, the meaning of "sale" within Health and Safety Code section 11359 has been greatly expanded after issuance of the opinion in <I>People v. Lazenby</I> (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1842.&nbsp; CALJIC No. 12.21 (Marijuana -- Illegal Possession For Sale) was revised in 1993 in light of <I>Lazenby</I> to define "sale" as "any exchange of marijuana for cash, favors, services, goods or other non-cash benefits."&nbsp; <I>Lazenby</I> looked back at 
former Health and Safety Code section 11008 which included "barter, exchange, or gift" within the definition of "sale."&nbsp; (<I>People v. Lazenby</I>, <I>supra</I>, 6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1845.)&nbsp; <I>Lazenby</I> noted that when former section 11008 was repealed in 1972 to bring California into substantial conformity with federal law, there was no indication the Legislature sought to prohibit only sales for cash.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; The conclusion that "sale" includes transfers other than for money comports with the evident purposes of the California legislation, the commonly accepted meaning of the term and settled rules of statutory interpretation.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)
<DD>It is clear from his testimony that appellant intended to provide at least some of the 40 pounds of marijuana to others who were not members of his church.&nbsp; (RT 356-357, 387-389, 394-399, 405-408, 412-413.)&nbsp; In return, appellant was seeking to obtain new adherents to his church because in his words there could be no faith without the marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 356-358, 385-388, 405-408.)&nbsp; Such an exchange is certainly a "non-cash benefit" within the meaning of the jury instruction.
<DD>Second, it is plain appellant was receiving physical and tangible
benefit from the exchange of the maftjuana.&nbsp; Specifically, appellant was receiving more marijuana.&nbsp; Appellant testified he took $30,000 to
purchase the marijuana in San Diego.&nbsp; (RT 391, 394.)&nbsp; Of that money, only $4,000 was his own.&nbsp; (RT 394.)&nbsp; Yet, appellant testified he was to receive <U>one-third</U> of the total amount of marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 404.)&nbsp; As the lower court noted at sentencing, appellant was "supplying others with marijuana at a particular price <U>as part of the kind of money changing</U> ..."&nbsp; (RT 534; emphasis added.)&nbsp; This exchange of marijuana had no spiritual element to it.&nbsp; A more precise definition of this transaction is probably "barter."&nbsp; It is common for drug dealers to receive payment in kind.&nbsp; Although it is sometimes difficult to tell in such situations who is the buyer and who is the seller, this type of exchange of marijuana for something of value is precisely what the law was intended to prohibit.
<DD>Third, appellant acknowledges that possession of a large amount of a controlled substance itself affords a reasonable inference of possession for sale.&nbsp; (AOB 7; <I>People v. Goliday</I> (1973) 8 Cal.3d 771, 783-784; <I>People v. Ingram</I> (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 673, 681; <I>People v. Grant</I> (1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 563, 570.)&nbsp; Appellant then attempts to rebut this inference by pointing to his own self-serving testimony about how he intended to give the marijuana to the members of his church for their
use of it as a sacrament.&nbsp; (AOB 6-7; RT 405-407.)&nbsp; However, since "sale" is not limited to the exchange of marijuana for cash (see <I>People v. Lazenby</I>, <I>supra</I>, 6 Cal.App.4th 1842, and above discussion), appellant has failed to rebut the inference.
<DD>Fourth, putting appellant's self-serving testimony aside, there
was strong circumstantial evidence that the marijuana was possessed for
sale.&nbsp; The 40 pounds of marijuana was already broken down into one pound increments, each pound individually wrapped.&nbsp; (CT 44.)&nbsp; Moreover, appellant had $2,350 in cash (CT 27, 39) in his BMW (which he claimed was a gift from his mother, RT 392).&nbsp; The retail value of the marijuana, depending on the quality, was worth $360,000 to $3.6 million dollars.&nbsp; (CT 43.)&nbsp; These factors led Sheriff's Investigator Joel Ontiveros to testify that in his expert opinion the 40 pounds of marijuana appellant was transporting was possessed for purposes of sale.&nbsp; (CT 41-42.)<SMALL><SUP><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#5">5</A></U>/</SUP></SMALL>
<DD>All of these reasons demonstrate there was substantial evidence to support appellant's conviction on count two, possession for sale of marijuana.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY RULED APPELLANT'S ACT OF TRANSPORTING MARIJUANA ACROSS STATE LINES, SOME OF WHICH WOULD GO TO INDIVIDUALS NOT CONNECTED WITH HIS CHURCH, CONSTITUTED A COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>It is not disputed that by finding appellant had engaged in <U>commercial activity</U> the lower court side-stepped the constitutional issue of whether the Health and Safety Code prohibitions against possession for sale and transporting of marijuana violated appellant's First Amendment right to freely practice his religion.&nbsp; Appellant attacks his conviction on both counts arguing the lower court erred by virtue of failing to reach the constitutional issue.&nbsp; (AOB 8.)&nbsp; Appellant is wrong.&nbsp; The caselaw is clear that constitutional questions are to be avoided when a case may be decided on other grounds.&nbsp; Moreover, there is substantial evidence to support the court's conclusion that appellant's transporting
of 40 pounds of marijuana was commercial activity.
<DD>Immediately prior to finding appellant guilty, the lower court made the following pertinent findings:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"[THE COURT]:&nbsp; Because <U>this case deals with marijuana commerce, which is incidental to rather than an inteitral part of the practice of the defendant's religious beliefs</U>, the Court feels it is not necessary for this Court to determine whether the State of California has adopted the lease [sic, "least"] restrictive means in order to further these valid governmental interests that relate to commercing in marijuana."&nbsp; (RT 519; emphasis added.)
<DD>"[THE COURT:]&nbsp; It's important to note that the Court is not confronted in this particular case with an individual who possessed a small unable quantity of marijuana in the privacy of his own home or house of worship or one who was cultivating a modest number of plants for personal use with the intent to utilize them as part of religious ceremonies or rights, but rather, the amount of contraband involved and the circumstances under which it was possessed clearly indicates that on the defendant's own admission that he was -- <U>he had purchased this marijuana for the purpose of transporting it interstate commerce to the state of Wisconsin</U> to the environs near his home <U>where it would be distributed to other individuals, some of whom were not involved in the practice -- practices of the Israel Zion Coptic Church.&nbsp; The defendant candidly acknowledged that he had no control over those drugs which would go to other parties</U>.&nbsp; The amounts of money involved in the purchase and the amount of the drugs themselves are clearly set forth in the record."&nbsp; (RT 519-520; emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>It is a well-settled rule of appellate review that constitutional questions are to be avoided when a case may be decided on other grounds.&nbsp; (<I>In re San Diego Commerce</I> (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1236; <I>In re Shannon B.</I> (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1235, 1246, fn. 7; <I>Reed v. City &amp; County of San Francisco</I> (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 572, 575; <I>People v.Bowen</I> (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 783, 789; <I>Palermo v. Stockton Theatres, Inc.</I> (1948) 32 Cal.2d 53, 65.)&nbsp; This is such a case.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to the disposition of this issue that the constitutionality of appellant's use of marijuana in his religion be determined.
<DD>There is substantial evidence to support the lower court's finding that appellant was engaging in marijuana commerce which was not called for by his religion, hence not covered by any assertion of First Amendment rights.&nbsp; Appellant testified he had pooled $30,000 together between himself and two other people from Iowa to purchase the 40 pounds of marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 391, 394.)&nbsp; These two people from Iowa had been members of appellant's church in Iowa, but the Iowa church had broken up.&nbsp; (RE 394-395.)&nbsp; Appellant had no way of knowing whether these friends of his from Iowa, who were going in with him on the purchase of the 40 pounds of marijuana, were going to use it as a sacrament," use it recreationally, or sell it commercially.&nbsp; (RT 412-415.)
<DD>Prior to going into this pooled transaction to purchase the 40 pounds of marijuana, appellant and his church members had been practicing their religion by purchasing small amounts of marijuana at the going Wisconsin rate of $40-$60 for quarter-ounce amounts.&nbsp; (RT 393.)&nbsp; Appellant considered this too expensive which is why he decided to buy a bulk amount in San Diego where he knew he could buy it much cheaper.&nbsp; (RT 392-394.)&nbsp; The fact that appellant had another avenue for practicing his religion with marijuana (i.e., purchasing it in smaller retail amounts in Wisconsin) which did not involve violating California's laws against trafficking in marijuana demonstrates the lower court was correct in side-stepping appellant's constitutional challenge.&nbsp; Constitutional
questions are to be avoided when a case may be decided on other grounds.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)<SMALL><SUP><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#6">6</A></U>/</SUP></SMALL>
<DD>Appellant's history also suggests his interest in the commercial aspect of marijuana is a long-standing concern.&nbsp; When appellant was arrested in 1987 for growing marijuana on his farm in Wisconsin, approximately <U>1,600 marijuana plants</U> were seized.&nbsp; (<I>State v. Peck</I> (Wis.App. 1988) 422 N.W2d 160, 162.)&nbsp; Clearly, this was more marijuana than the 24 members of his congregation (RT 326-327) could reasonably use.
<DD>Recently, the Ninth Circuit analyzed a similar constitutional challenge brought by Rastafarians on religious grounds to their prosecution under federal statutes against marijuana trafficking.&nbsp; (<I>United States v. Bauer</I> (9th Cir. 1996) 75 E3d 1366.)&nbsp; Although the Ninth Circuit
ruled that under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act the district court erred in excluding evidence in support of a religious defense as to the counts of simple possession, the district court also ruled it was <U>not error to side-step the freedom of religion issue altogether with regards to the counts beyond simple possession of marijuana</U>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"As to the counts relating to conspiracy to distribute, possession with intent to distribute, and money laundering, the religious freedom of the defendants was not invaded.&nbsp; Nothing before us suggests that Rastafarianism would require this conduct.&nbsp; These counts stand."&nbsp; (<I>United States v. Bauer</I>, <I>supra</I>, 75 F.3d at pp. 1375-1376; emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Just as Rastafarianism was not a proper defense to commercial trafficking in marijuana in <I>Bauer</I>, appellant's professed religious beliefs (which are an off-shoot of Rastafarianism; RT 334-342; CT 84) was not a proper defense to appellant's commercial trafficking in marijuana in the instant case.&nbsp; The lower cottrt was correct in side-stepping the constitutional issue of whether California's statutes against possession for sale and transportation of marijuana violated appellant's First Amendment right to freely practice his religion.

<B>APPELLANT WAIVED ANY OBJECTIONS TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PROBATION BY NOT OBJECTING TO THEM AT THE TIME OF SENTENCING</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Appellant next argues the terms of his probation which prohibit him from possessing or using any controlled substance, and also prohibit him from associating with unrelated persons who possess, use or traffic in controlled substances unconstitutionally burden his free exercise of religion and his freedom of association.&nbsp; (AOB 17.)&nbsp; Appellant waived this issue by failing to object to these terms and conditions of probation at the sentencing hearing.
<DD>In <I>People v. Welch</I> (1993) 5 Cal.4th 228, the California Supreme Court held that the failure to object to probation conditions at the time of sentencing waives the issue on appeal.&nbsp; (<I>Id</I>., at pp. 234-237; accord <I>People v. Scott</I> (1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 356-358; see also <I>People v. Planavsky</I> (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1302.)
<DD>In the instant case, the probation report which was issued on June 29, 1995, recommended probation for appellant on condition appellant comply with specified terms and conditions including:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"(1)&nbsp; Violate no law or ordinance;
<DD>"...........................
<DD>"(6)&nbsp; Not associate with any unrelated person known to be a possessor, user, or trafficker of controlled substances, nor any unrelated person on probation or parole; and
<DD>"(7)&nbsp; Not possess nor use any controlled substances unless medically prescribed; any prescribed usage to be immediately reported to the Probation Officer."&nbsp; (CT 266I-266K.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>At the sentencing hearing held July 10, 1995, defense counsel stated appellant was "willing and able to comply with the terms of probation."&nbsp; (RT 525.)&nbsp; The court specifically addressed appellant and invited him to comment on the recommendations of the probation report:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"THE COURT:&nbsp; Mr. Peck ... I've [sic] assume you've read through the probation officer's report and understand the terms and conditions of probation they are recommending.
<DD>"You have a right at this point in time, as far as I'm concerned, to address the Court as to the decisions I'm about to make ..."&nbsp; (RT 529.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Despite this invitation, appellant did not object personally or through counsel to the recommended terms and conditions of probation.&nbsp; Then, the court went through each individual term and condition of probation on the record with appellant (RT 535-541) after which the court again invited any comment on the terms of probation from appellant:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"[THE COURT:]&nbsp; You understand all of these terms and conditions?
<DD>"THE DEFENDANT:&nbsp; Yes, I do.
<DD>"THE COURT:&nbsp; You have any question about anything I said to you?
<DD>"THE DEFENDANT:&nbsp; No, I don't.
<DD>"THE COURT:&nbsp; Do you accept these terms and conditions?
<DD>"THE DEFENDANT:&nbsp; Yes."&nbsp; (RT 541.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Because appellant failed to object to the terms and conditions of probation at the time of sentencing, the issue is waived on appeal.&nbsp; (<I>People v.

<B>IT IS UNNECESSARY TO REACH THE ISSUE OF WHETHER APPELLANT'S USE OF MARIJUANA IS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT'S FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION CLAUSE; BUT IF IT IS REACHED, APPELLANT'S ARGUMENT SHOULD STILL BE REJECTED</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>As previously stated, respondent argues it is unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue of whether appellant's use of marijuana is protected by the First Amendment because he was punished for marijuana trafficking which was incidental to, rather than an integral part of, the practice of his religion.&nbsp; (See Argument II, <I>supra</I>, incorporated here by reference.)
<DD>However, assuming arguendo this Court reaches the constitutional issue, respodent submits appellant's convictions here for transporting marijuana and possession for sale of marijuana are not protected by the First Amendment's Free exercise of religion clause for the following reasons.
<DD>Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (hereinafter "RFRA") in 1993 (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb)<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#8">8</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP> in response to the United States Supreme Court opinion in <I>Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith</I> (1990) 494 U.S. 872, 108 L.Ed.2d 876,110 S.Ct. 1595.&nbsp; (Hereinafter <I>Smith</I>.)&nbsp; While implicitly criticizing <I>Smith</I>, the statute does not present itself as an interpretation of the Constitution overruling <I>Smith</I>; rather it consists of a command that must be followed as a matter of federal law.&nbsp; (<I>United States v. Bauer</I>, <I>supra</I>, F.3d at p. 1374.)&nbsp; The statute restored and codified the "compelling interest test" as set forth in <I>Sherbert v. Verner</I> (1963) 374 U.S. 398 [10 L.Ed.2d 965, 83 S.Ct. 1790]; and <I>Wisconsin v. Yoder</I> (1972) 406 U.S. 205 [32 L.Ed.2d 15, 92 S.Ct. 1526], for purposes of analyzing whether statutes substantially burden religious exercise without compelling justification.&nbsp; (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb, subds. (a) and (b); see <I>United States v. Bauer</I>, <I>supra</I>, 75 F.3d at pp. 1374-1375.)&nbsp; The compelling interest test is set forth in the statute as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"Government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person --
<DD>"(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and
<DD>"(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest."&nbsp; (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb-1, subd. (b).)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Applying this test to the instant case, the lower court correctly found that California's laws prohibiting the transportation and possession for sale of marijuana were in furtherance of compelling governmental interests.&nbsp; (RT 519.)
<DD>Moreover, respondent submits California's statutes (Health & Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 11360 and 11359) are the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling governmental interests.<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#9">9</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP>

<P>
<DD>In the instant case, the lower court held that California's laws
prohibiting the transportation and possession for sale of marijuana were
in furtherance of compelling governmental interests:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"[THE COURT:]&nbsp; From the evidence received in this trial, the Court finds that the enforcement of laws prohibiting commercial transactions in marijuana embodied in Health and Safety Code Section 11359 and 11360 are valid and compelling public health safety, societal and governmental health interest[s] on the part of the People on [sic, "of"] the state of California."&nbsp; (RT 519.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>The lower court's ruling was correct and should be upheld by this Court.&nbsp; In examining the reasons supporting this conclusion, it should
first be noted that two other states, Wisconsin and Iowa, have come to the same conclusion with regard to religious constitutional challenges to the marijuana laws by members of the Coptic Church.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><A NAME="IVA1">1</A>.&nbsp; Deference Should Be Given To Decisions By
Other State Courts
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Have Ruled On This Issue</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>In <I>State v. Peck</I>, <I>supra</I>, 422 N.W2d 160, appellant was the
defendant and he challenged Wisconsin's marijuana laws on the same grounds he is challenging California's marijuana laws in the instant case.&nbsp; The Wisconsin court stated in relevant part as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"The Wisconsin legislature, in enacting ch. 161, Stats. [Wisconsin's drug laws], expressly found that the abuse of marijuana and other controlled substances 'constitutes a serious problem foe society.'&nbsp; [Citation.] ...&nbsp; In <I>Rush</I> [<I>United States v. Rush</I> (1st Cir. 1984) 738 F.2d 497], a case involving an identical 'free exercise' challenge to federal drug laws by the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, the court, while recognizing conflicting opinions as to whether marijuana is a health hazard and a threat to social welfare or simply a harmless recreational drug, noted that:
<DD>"<U>Every federal court that has considered the matter, so far as we are aware, has accepted the congressional determination that marijuana in fact poses a real threat to individual health and social welfare, and has upheld the criminal sanctions for possession and distribution of marijuana even where such sanctions infringe on the free exercise of religion</U>.&nbsp; <I>Id</I>. at 512.&nbsp; [Footnote omitted.]
<DD>"A majority of state courts considering the question have reached a similar result.&nbsp; [Footnote omitted.]
<DD>".....................
<DD>"<U>Preservation of the public health and safety is the obvious purpose underlying Wisconsin's drug laws, and we see a compelling state purpose in the regulation of marijuana and other controlled substances</U>.&nbsp; On this record, and in light of the nearly unanimous rulings of other state and federal courts on the issue, we conclude that the state interest is of sufficient magnitude to override Peck's first amendment interest in using the drug as a daily continual sacrament in his admittedly sincere role as a member of the Israel Zion Coptic Church.&nbsp; [Footnote omitted.]"&nbsp; (<I>State v. Peck</I>, <I>supra</I>, 422 N.W2d at pp. 163-164; emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Similarly, in <I>State v. Olsen</I> (Iowa 1982) 315 N.W.2d 1, the defendant, a priest in the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church charged with possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, challenged the trial court's refusal of his requested instructions on the religious use of marijuana as
a defense.&nbsp; The Supreme Court of Iowa concluded:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"A compelling state interest sufficient to override Olsen's free exercise clause argument is demonstrated in this case."&nbsp; (<I>Id</I>., at p. 9.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Appellant testified he regularly smoked marijuana and would then drive on the streets and highways of Wisconsin.&nbsp; (RT 363-367, 373-376, 423.)&nbsp; In fact, he had smoked marijuana in his hotel the morning of his arrest.&nbsp; (RT 410.)&nbsp; Had the 40 pounds of marijuana in appellant's car not been seized, they would clearly have had a deleterious effect on the
citizens of Wisconsin, and possibly Iowa.&nbsp; Appellant, with rolling papers in his pocket, was found headed north on Interstate 13, and presumably
would have exited California within a few hours and passed through several other states before arriving home in Wisconsin.&nbsp; Because the effects of appellant driving possibly under the influence of marijuana would have been felt in the states of Wisconsin and Iowa, this Court should give deference to the decisions of those states.&nbsp; <U>Comity</U> should be given to the decisions of the sister states of Wisconsin and Iowa with regard to decisions primarily affecting the health and welfare of citizens of those states.&nbsp; (See <I>People v. Pensinger</I> (1991) 32 Cal.3d 1210, 1261.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><A NAME="IVA2">2</A>.&nbsp; The Evidence In This Case Demonstrated Compelling State
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interests</B>

<DD>The testimony of expert witnesses and appellant's own testimony about the casual and continuous smoking of marijuana by members of his church demonstrated why California has compelling state interests in regulating marijuana to promote public health and safety in California.
<DD>Prosecution expert Dr. Marcelline Burns testified she had "hands-on" experience in administering smoked marijuana to individuals and then observing them as they are asked to perform a variety of tasks.&nbsp; (RT 102-107, 110-129.)&nbsp; Dr. Burns described tests she conducted with regard to attention and motor skills, particularly the driving of automobiles and flying of airplanes.&nbsp; (RT 110-129, 238-239.)&nbsp; She testified individuals smoking marijuana<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#10">10</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP> were unsafe to drive a car.&nbsp; (RT 126-129, 132-135, 236, 301, 305-306.)&nbsp; Dr. Burns testified such individuals displayed tracking, concentration, and reaction time problems.&nbsp; (RT 126-129, 132.)&nbsp; She testified these symptoms would persist for four to eight hours.&nbsp; (RT 134.)
<DD>Dr. Burns noted several studies indicate marijuana use may cause short-term changes in brain structure, temporarily lowered testosterone levels, and possible "a-motivational syndrome."&nbsp; (RT 243-244.)&nbsp; Based upon the effects she has observed in those who use marijuana, and the literature she has read, she had strong concerns about providing marijuana to children.&nbsp; (RT 129, 237-238.)
<DD>Defense expert Dr. John Morgan testified he too had strong concerns about providing marijuana to children.&nbsp; (RT 189, 221-222.)&nbsp; He believed marijuana use impaired driving.&nbsp; (RT 199, 202-203.)&nbsp; Because marijuana causes a quickening of the heart rate, Dr. Morgan recommended that anyone intending to smoke marijuana should first have a physical exam.&nbsp; (RT 220-221.)
<DD>The manner in which appellant and other members of his church use marijuana takes on partictilar significance when considered in light of the above expert testimony.
<DD>Appellant testified members of his church occasionally smoke marijuana all day long.&nbsp; (RT 359; see also RT 205.)&nbsp; Appellant acknowledged marijuana is provided to children; sometimes children earlier than eight years smoke marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 319-321, 382-385.)
<DD>On a typical day, appellant stated he would start the morning by sharing a joint with his wife; sometimes smoking an entire joint by himself.&nbsp; (RT 363-367.)&nbsp; He would then leave to work in his fence installing business.&nbsp; (RT 363-367.)&nbsp; He has a mechanical hold digging machine he operates.&nbsp; (RT 367.)&nbsp; In order to get to job sites, appellant
drives on the roads and highways of Wisconsin.&nbsp; (RT 363-367.)&nbsp; If time permits, appellant smokes a joint during lunch and then drives back to
work in his vehicle.&nbsp; (RT 364.)&nbsp; In the evening, appellant smokes
marijuana again, often times sharing it with his wife and at least some
of his children.&nbsp; (RT 319-321, 363-367, 382-385.)&nbsp; The older children sometimes smoked marijuana in the evening even though they would be
going to school the next day with their homework assignments.&nbsp; (RT 384-387.)&nbsp; Appellant testified that thouagh he and his wife smoked marijuana, they were typically the only persons watching their children as they played.&nbsp; (RT 390.)
<DD>Appellant's friend, Michael Matteson, who is also a member of appellant's church does things much the same as appellant expect that he is a carpenter.&nbsp; (RT 324-328, 358-361.)&nbsp; Mr. Matteson spends a lot of time in his carpentry workshop operating electric tools including a band saw.&nbsp; (RT 369-371.)&nbsp; Nevertheless, marijuana is smoked there by
Mr. Matteson and his children.&nbsp; (RT 371-373.)
<DD>Appellant makes no effort to limit his marijuana use to certain days of the week or to specific religious ceremonies (RT 360-362, 354-355), such as Native American Church members do with peyote and marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 36, 40-41, 45-46, 51-55, 67-69.)&nbsp; Rather, he provides it to his young children and he smokes marijuana frequently before getting behind the wheel to drive on public streets and before operating heavy machinery.&nbsp; Such disregard for the health and safety of himself, his family and the public at large vividly demonstrates why California has a compelling interest to intervene and regulate such conduct.&nbsp; The lower court did not abuse its discretion in so finding.
<P>
<B><A NAME="IVB">B</A>.&nbsp; <U>California's Marijuana Laws Are The Least Restrictive Means Of</U>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Furthering The Compelling State Interests In Public Health And Safety</U></B>
<P>
<DD>The least restrictive means prong of the compelling state interest test is less developed than the first prong of identifying a compelling state interest.&nbsp; The reason this is so appears to be because once a court has found a compelling state interest, it is difficult for a court to dictate how this interest might be "fine-tuned" in its application.&nbsp; Administration of a law is an executive function which must take into account such problems as day-to-day administrative mechanics, distribution of limited resources, long-term effects, and other such considerations.&nbsp; As stated by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals in <I>State v. Peck</I>, <I>supra</I>, 422 N.W.2d at page 164, footnote 3:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"Peck suggests without elaboration, that the state could accomplish its goals by developing 'reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on the use of marijuana.'&nbsp; Any such action, however, would be for the legislature, not the courts, to undertake."&nbsp; (Emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Nevertheless, assuming this Court has reached this stage of the constitutional analysis<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#11">11</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP>, a key distinction should be kept in mind: because appellant was convicted of marijuana trafficking offenses (Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11360, subd. (a), transporting marijuana; and Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11359, possession of marijuana for sale) rather than simple possession of marijuana, the real issue presented here is  whether Health and Safety Code sections 11360, subdivision (a), and 11359 are the <U>least restrictive means with regard to controlling marijuana trafficking</U>.&nbsp; The issue is <U>not</U>, as appellant attempts to frame it, whether California's laws with regard to simple possession of an unspecified amount of marijuana for personal religious use are the least restrictive means available so as not to infringe on the First Amendment religious freedom rights of citizens.<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#12">12</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP>
<DD>With this distinction in mind, let us turn to Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in <I>Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith</I>, <I>supra</I>, 494 U.S. 872.&nbsp; In <I>Smith</I>, Justice O'Connor concurred in the judgment of the majority but did so by
applying the <I>Sherbert</I> test, which is exactly what Congress mandated in subsequently passing the RFRA in 1993.&nbsp; (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb, subd.
(b).)&nbsp; With regard to peyote use within the context of a religious ceremony of the Native American Church, she found there was a compelling state interest in the regulation of peyote by the government and it was advanced by the least restrictive means.&nbsp; She wrote, "I would conclude that uniform application of Oregon's criminal prohibition is 'essential to accomplish' [citationj its overriding interest in preventing the physical harm caused by the use of a Schedule I controlled substance."&nbsp; (Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. at p. 905.)&nbsp; Justice O'Connor gave two reasons.&nbsp; First, "[b]ecause the health effects caused by the use of controlled substances exist regardless of the motivation of the user, the use of such substances, even for religious purposes, violates the very purpose of the laws that prohibit them.&nbsp; [Citation.]"&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; Second, "in view of the societal interest in preventing trafficking in controlled substances, uniform application of the criminal prohibition at issue is essential to the effectiveness of Oregon's stated interest in preventing any possession of peyote.&nbsp; [Citation.]"&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; Though Justice O'Connor was discussing peyote, the same rationales apply equally with regard to marijuana.&nbsp; The health effects and dangers exist both with regard to adults and children notwithstanding the religious purpose for which appellant claims it is used.&nbsp; To permit appellant to use and distribute marijuana among friends and family even for religious purposes does not resolve state health concerns.&nbsp; Likewise, with regard to preventing trafficking in marijuana -- to accept appellant's religious defense to his trafficking convictions would put an unworkable burden on law enforcement and the courts to divine who fall into the category of a religious exemption at any given moment in time.  It was also encourage completely non-religious marijuana traffickers to raise bogus religious defenses in efforts to cloak their true nefarious purposes.&nbsp; (See <I>United States v. Meyers</I> (D.Wyo. 1995) 906 F.Supp. 1494 [district court rejected claim that self-declared "Reverend" in the "Church of Marijuana" had legitimate religious beliefs protectable under RFRA].)
<DD>Similarly, this Court in <I>Music Plus Four, Inc v. Barnet</I> (1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 113, upheld a city ordinance which prohibited the display and sale of drug and marijuana paraphernalia (pipes, "alligator" clips, etc.) to minors.&nbsp; This Court found it was a compelling state interest "of the highest priority" to "protect children from exploitation by those trafficking in drugs and drug-related products."&nbsp; (<I>Id</I>., at p. 130.)&nbsp; Likewise, this Court found that the city ordinance which required minors to be accompanied by a parent or guardian before such drug and marijuana paraphernalia could be displayed or sold to them was "<U>the least restrictive means</U> to achieve that goal."&nbsp; (<I>Music Plus Four, Inc. v. Barnet</I>, <I>supra</I>, 114 Cal.App.3d at p. 130; emphasis added.)&nbsp; If it is a compelling state interest of the highest priority to protect children from exposure to marijuana-related products, certainly it is an even higher priority to protect them from the actual trafficking of marijuana.&nbsp; Likewise, Health and Safety Code sections 11360, subdivision (a), and 11359 are the least restrictive means with regard to controlling marijuana trafficking because the threat of substantial prison incarceration is necessary as a deterrent to those who would traffic marijuana to our children and citizens in general.&nbsp; The fact that these laws also provide flexibility with the possibility of probation (such as in appellant's case) for those motivated by more benign purposes also reflects how these statutes are the least restrictive means for achieving the state's compelling interests in ensuring public health and safety.
<DD>Ultimately, in this specific case, the least restrictive means prong is not of great importance.&nbsp; Even if California had in place a system by which appellant was able to lawfully obtain marijuana for religious purposes, such a system would still not address most of the state's primary concerns.&nbsp; Appellant gets into motor vehicles and drives shortly after smoking marijuana.&nbsp; It seems relatively clear appellant does not believe marijuana smoking substantially impairs a driver or heavy machine operator.&nbsp; He gives marijuana to children.&nbsp; If the state permitted appellant's use of marijuana but forbade it to his children, appellant apparently would not follow such a law as he believes it is necessary for children to smoke marijuana once they have reached the "age of reason" in order to follow his beliefs.&nbsp; (KT 382-384.)
<DD>For all these reasons, appellant's use of marijuana is not protected by the First Amendment.

<DD><A NAME="1">1</A>.&nbsp; Counsel stipulated that the transcript of the Grand Jury proceedings be admitted into evidence at trial.&nbsp; (RT 14.)
<DD><A NAME="2">2</A>.&nbsp; <I>Miranda v. Arizona</I> (1966) 384 U.S. 436, 444 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694].
<DD><A NAME="3">3</A>.&nbsp; Counsel stipulated that the transcript of the August 29, 1994, Evidence Code section 402 hearing being admitted into evidence at trial.&nbsp; (RT 9-10.)
<DD><A NAME="4">4</A>.&nbsp; Expert witnesses also testified regarding the effects and harmfulness of marijuana.&nbsp; The testimony of these witnesses is discussed in Argument IV.
<DD><A NAME="5">5</A>.&nbsp; It should also be noted that it was unlikely appellant could have used the entire 13 pounds of marijuana which was to be his portion of the 40 pounds entirely by his church.&nbsp; Appellant testified that there were only 24 members of his church, including his children.&nbsp; (RT 326-327.)&nbsp; Appellant also testified he and his wife smoked an average of about three joints of marijuana per day between them.&nbsp; (RT 363-364.)&nbsp; However, Sheriffs Investigator Ontiveros testified that according to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Campaign Against Marijuana Planting (CAMP), ten pounds of marijuana would yield enough hours of intoxication for one person to stay intoxicated for 2.1 years contintiously.&nbsp; That's smoking one-half gram marijuana joint or marijuana cigarette every two hours, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year."&nbsp; (CT 42.)
<DD><A NAME="6">6</A>.&nbsp; Assuming arguendo the lower court should not have side-stepped appellant's First Amendment challenge, it should still be rejected for the reasons set forth in Argument IV, <I>infra</I>.
<DD><A NAME="7">7</A>.&nbsp; Even assuming arguendo the issue were not waived on appeal, the terms and conditions of probation were proper in any event (See Argument IV, <I>infra</I>.)
<DD><A NAME="8">8</A>.&nbsp; The lower court noted that the RFRA controlled in this case:&nbsp; The defense contends and the People concede in this case that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 governs the application of California state laws relating fo the use, possession, and distribution of marijuana by the defendant in this case."&nbsp; (RT 519.)&nbsp; Appellant's reliance on the old California case <I>People v. Woody</I> (1964) 61 Cal.2d 716 to support his constitutional challenge is misplaced.&nbsp; <I>Woody</I> based its analysis strictly on federal grounds and did not analyze the issue based on independent state grounds.
<DD><A NAME="9">9</A>.&nbsp; The threshold consideration for even applying the compelling interest test is to determine the sincerity of the defendant's belief in the tenants and practices of the religion of which he asserts he is a part.&nbsp; (<I>United States v. Bauer</I>, <I>supra</I>, 75 F.3d at p.
1376.)&nbsp; Here, the prosecution contested the sincerity of appellant's beliefs but the court implicitly found them to be sincere.&nbsp; (RT 518-519, 533-534.)&nbsp; Insofar as the lower court's determination is a factual finding, it is entitled to deference on appeal.&nbsp; (See <I>People v. Marquez</I> (1992) 1 Cal.4th 553, 570; <I>People v. Meredith</I> (1992) 11 Ca1.App.4th 1548, 1561; <I>People v. Gallant</I> (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 200, 206.)&nbsp; However, if the court's finding is a mixed question of fact and law, this Court is entitled to review the issue independently.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>; see also <I>People v. Boissard</I> (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 972, 977.)&nbsp; Respondent submits appellant's religious beliefs are not sincerely held.&nbsp; (See Argument I, <I>supra</I>; see CT 238-239; see also tbe factors used in <I>U.S. v. Myers</I> (D.Wyo. 1995) 906 F.Supp. 1494 to determine the sincerity of the religious beliefs of a self-declared "Reverend" in the "Church of Marijuana.")
<DD><A NAME="10">10</A>.&nbsp; Dr. Burns noted her laboratory marijuana was about six to seven times weaker than marijuana found on the street.&nbsp; (RT 235.)
<DD><A NAME="11">11</A>.&nbsp; See <I>Transport Workers' Local 234 v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority</I> (3rd Cir. 1988) 863 F.2d 1110, 1120 [the least restrictive means analysis applied in cases implicating the First Amendment is not applicable to cases arising under the Fourth Amendment].
<DD><A NAME="12">12</A>.&nbsp; Indeed, had appellant been arrested for mere possession of less than an ounce of marijuana for use in his religion, he would only have suffered a citation (the equivalent of a speeding ticket and not even been booked.  (Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11357, subd. (b).)  Clearly, such a legislative scheme for simple possession of small amounts of marijuana is <U>the least restrictive means</U> of achieving the compelling state interest in public health and safety.

Lewisburg, PA 17837</font></p>

<p><font size="4">December 16, 1996</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Hello Carl,<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I thank you for forwarding a copy of Brian's letter to me along
with your newsletter.&nbsp; As you suspected, I was and am amused
with Brian's observations of life and his veiled hopes for something
better to come.&nbsp; His voice arising to me from the type
renews and invigorates my personal pride in my own son whom I
consider to be an unselfish and uncomplaining sufferer in this spiritual battle
which has immersed us completely.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I am encouraged ever so subtly when I hear from you that you
preceive some of the concepts that are always in the forefront of
my consciousness in a similar manner as I, myself, see
them.&nbsp; When you describe the folks who first told you about
Ivy and his cosmic as being super-charged, I know that you fully
understand the differentiation that I am making between that
purity of purpose and thought and the ensuing smuggling debacle
which evolved under the Coptic guise.&nbsp; I know that you must
have experienced some degree of this super-charged spirit
yourself or you could never have recognized it as something
unique and special.&nbsp; I am also certain that others
throughout history have manifest this storied Christ-like
persona, but Ivy it the only one that I personally experienced.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I know that it is very difficult to balance the seeming dichotomy
between that purity of unfeigned selfless service and the
unbridled vanity of the smuggling apparatus that chewed us up and
spit us out along with our spiritual siblings, leaving the
residue we now know.&nbsp; I also know and feel the same conflict
that you experience as my human nature wars against my quest for
divinity, each staging victories, each suffering defeats.&nbsp; I
do not torment myself over these inevitable clashes.&nbsp; I am
confident that the spirit must and will prevail and that the
final result can only be in our sincere glorification of that
holy spirit.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I do not know and I cannot say of a certainty that there will
ever be any reunion or gathering of these scattered individuals
we often refer to as the brothers and sisters.&nbsp; I do,
however, hold onto a sincere hope that such a cataclysmic revival
of love could actually transpire and, because I know the joy and
ecstasy that I have experienced, I maintain that glimmer of hope
that this spirit can again resurrect itself among us despite the
overwhelming odds that appear to prohibit such an event.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">We all have our experiences with the herb in every imaginable
scenario.&nbsp; The herb is our sacrament and we are the
ministers and the mistresses of the herb and the civilization
which is inherent to the spiritual use and understanding of the
herb.&nbsp; I know that you are one of the, if not the, foremost
spokespersons and representatives of the &quot;plant of
renown.&quot;&nbsp; Through your diligent and determined efforts
you have achieved the respect of countless people who otherwise
would not have heard of the compelling argument that cannot be logically
resisted.&nbsp; I understand the forum that you have created
through your persistence.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Many of our former colleagues have withdrawn or retracted from
the forefront for various reasons.&nbsp; Some because of the
persecution, but mostly because of the penalty from the law enforcement
tenacle of the political beast.&nbsp; Many are not willing to
stop partaking.&nbsp; Some, as you suggest, refuse to stop the
cultivation, or buying and selling, possibly importing the sweet
smelling incense.&nbsp; I cannot say anything about someone's
choice in how they decide to either use or not use the
ganja.&nbsp; I loved every aspect of the herb culture.&nbsp; The only
element of everything that I have experienced with the herb that
I now consider to be regrettable is the crass commercialization
of a natural substance that should be free politically and free
or of minimal monetary value commercially.&nbsp; Ideally free,
but I will not attempt to determine economics because of the
elusive nature of people's private business.&nbsp; I know you understand
that I am merely saying that our motivation and our
administration is not commercial.&nbsp; Although this is far from
the reality of today's social conditions.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I do not feel as though I have transgressed in any of my
endeavors in the herb culture.&nbsp; I am being persecuted by the
unjust political policies of a very corrupt and self-serving
government.&nbsp; I would gladly give up even my life and everything
related to that life before I would ever allow the evil to speak
their sinister lies about the herb without challenge.&nbsp; As
long as my alleged crime against society is related to the ganja,
I am prepared to proudly bear whatevery the demons deem as my
punishment.&nbsp; I realize that wasting away in a federal dungeon
can appear to be a frivolous and somewhat stupid way to end up,
but since this is the consequence of my sincere pursuit of my belief
that ganja is good, then I am determined to bear the consequence
with as much dignity as I can muster.&nbsp; I am honestly not
remorseful because of this.&nbsp; The only thing that grieves my
soul in any continual manner is the suffering of my family being separated
and, in the same vein, the estrangement of the sisters and
brothers when I know the potential of the &quot;perfect
love&quot; that we once shared for those fleeting moments of
perfection.&nbsp; As you have stated, I also feel that I have a unique
and enlightening understanding of the herb and, although my forum
is not nearly as vast or as productive as that which you have
achieved through your inspired efforts, I am committed completely
to defending the use of herb for spiritual communion.&nbsp; I
know that collectively we can move mountains.&nbsp; I also
realize that this eventually does not seem likely.&nbsp; Yet I
cannot release that hope which, for whatever reason, remains real
to me.&nbsp; I am not hoping to claim a reward before a work is
completed.&nbsp; I am simply relating to you that the reuniting
of these old farts, no matter how cantankerous and contrary many
of us have become, is also a great work, in my own mind at least, and
I somehow can't shake the perception that this is an essential
ingredient in the big picture that, perhaps, you foresee.&nbsp; I
also know that this almost seem vain.&nbsp; But I do see that big
set of nerds, regardless of how remotely they were touched by Ivy's
&quot;super-charged&quot; aura of consciousness, as a spiritual
body that must be revived.&nbsp; This may be an illusion, but it
is the illusion I cling to and will undoubtedly cling to until my
final breath.&nbsp; This in no way diminishes the monumental work
that you are doing.&nbsp; In fact, I see it as a natural
progression of things.&nbsp; However it works out, my love for you
and all of the characters in my imaginary drama only increases.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I liked the three basic issue that interest Neil
Montgomery.&nbsp; His inquiries seem to be sincere and, really,
they do provoke wonderful thoughts.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">(1) How best does the EZCC fit into the definitions of religion?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">As you know, the term religion invokes a somewhat negative
reaction because of the malicious and murderous behaviors that
have been and are being performed under the guise of religion and
in the name of God.&nbsp; Almost every religion in this world
today seems to condemn me, imprison me, and even (in their
thoughts) to kill me because I proclaim that the cannabis
(marijuana, ganja, herb, hemp, etc.,...) is the only substance
provided by nature (God) that heightens the perceptions of human
beings, thus enabling the lowly creatures to more readily exhibit
divine qualities such as love, equality, unity, and charity and
to actually commune more consciously with the purity of that holy spirit which
dwells within our consciousness.&nbsp; Because humanity is so
inextricably committed to fulfilling their own wicked lusts and
vanities it has become increasingly more difficult for this potentially
divine species to cease from their sinful ways because, honestly,
the vast majority prefer sin and corruption above anything that
even suggests godliness.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I am a bit reluctant to tout the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church
banner as the harbinger of the sacramental civilization that is
inherent within these people that I will introduce as the
possessors of this civilization because that Coptic Era represented
a commercial diversion for us as a spiritual body and must be
cast aside as simply a stage in the inevitable metamorphosis of
these divine people who are uniquely aware of the ganja
mystery.&nbsp; Call us what you will.&nbsp; A true religion deals with
the worship of God as a result of the faith and belief of its adherents
in the infallibility and goodness of God's relationship to
mankind and to all creation, thus manifesting in perfect love,
one toward another; not just in words alone -- in the
indisputability or our deeds and our actions.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">By this definition, or by any definition, we qualify!<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">(2) What is a sacrament?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">My only personal understanding of these religious rites or
functions of faith has to do with Christian doctrines whose
origins stem from the Bible and the life of the man-Christ who is
the focus of our meditations.&nbsp; The understanding that we, as
humans, have been able to grasp has come to fruition primarily as
a result of the mediations and interpretations of this man's
teachings through what has been purportedly recorded of his
various messages.&nbsp; I am not concerned with the controversy
about the divine authority of this messianic messenger.&nbsp; I will
only deal at this juncture with the sacrament that was
established by this Christ and commonly known as the
Eucharist.&nbsp; I know the tired and stale rituals of various
Christian dogmas that show the people a piece of bread or a flour wafer
and a cup of wine as the representation spoken of in the
eucharistic parables about the &quot;body and blood&quot; of
Christ.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Now, obviously we are not eating a man's flesh nor are we
drinking a man's blood.&nbsp; This is a symbolism for partaking
of a spirit or a spiritual food that would instill in those who
share this Eucharist a more Christlike perception and, therefore,
a more Christlike behavior.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Let us examine for a moment these substances, bread and
wine.&nbsp; Whether blessed or not, the reaction to them does not
change.&nbsp; Bread does absolutely nothing to the spiritual
consciousness of a man or a woman.&nbsp; Wine, on the other hand,
will cause any human to become drunken and manifest various spiritually
unconscious behaviors when imbibed in excessive quantities.&nbsp;
If memory serves me, and I'm sure that it does, the scripture
says something like &quot;As often as you partake of this, do it
in remembrance of me (Christ).&quot;&nbsp; Even if someone should
begin partaking of the fermented fruit juice with the intention
of a spiritual meditation to coincide with the drinking, they would
invariably lose sight of the &quot;blood of Christ&quot; concept
as the alcohol level increases in their own bloodstream.&nbsp;
And then what?&nbsp; They cannot locate the moral integrity that is
required to enter into the heavenly places.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I am more than just aware of the propaganda and the outright lies
that have been formulated and spread in the minds of people
everywhere concerning the herb.&nbsp; I will not at this moment
argue inane malarkey that has been used to malign the most
wonderful organic substance that mankind has available in abundance
at their fingertips.&nbsp; I will simply declare that the herb
known as cannabis is the only substance in all of creation that
even remotely resembles the properties of this &quot;holy Eucharist.&quot;&nbsp;
No other substance, either natural or synthetic, can break down
the barriers of selfish pride, of racial hatred and strife, of
greed and malice like a few tokes of <u>good</u> (not the
commercial crap) ganja weed.&nbsp; There is no other substance on
earth that enhances the equality concept like a few more pulls on
the pipe that is packed with the aromatic blend of ganja
buds.&nbsp; There is no quicker way to journey to the prophetic
Mt. Zion, a choice and happy place that is adorned with wonderous
grace, than by inhaling deeply of the &quot;holy smoke&quot;
emanating from the ember of the &quot;burning bush&quot; that our
forefather Moses was wont to burn.&nbsp; The greatest comforter
to the human soul on all the face of all the earth is the sweet,
sweet essence of <u>good</u>, ripe ganja.&nbsp; It cannot be made
by men in their laboratories and it cannot be dethroned as the
king and the queen, the alpha and the omega, in the beginning and
in the end, the delightfully delicious Eucharist provided absolutely
free by our great and merciful God.&nbsp; We thank you!&nbsp; And
the smoke arises in every corner of this earth in spite of the
most fearsome and barbaric persecution by the wicked and barbaric
religious-political-commercial governments.&nbsp; I do not wish
to argue the validity of whether or not smoking the ganja is this
spirit of consciousness which I have briefly described as a sacrament.&nbsp;
I am formally and explicitly announcing that it is a sacrament,
has been a sacrament for at least two millenia and is my
eucharistic vehicle which allows me to journey in the spirit to
the realms of Christlike understanding.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">(3) What is the proof of claim to the sacrament?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">In answer to this question, volumes could easily be written
stating the historical use of ganja in every era and spiritual
advent throughout man's and woman's development from the time
when recorded documents first appeared.&nbsp; A very convincing
argument can be made by us concerning the use of this herb by all
of the prophets, priests, and apostles of scriptural lore and
innumerable references through mystical symbols and parables to
the use of this sweet smelling incense by all of these holy men
and women of old as told in the Bible.&nbsp; This only engenders
controversy and accusations and, quite probably, not a little
vexation from the bible-thumpers everywhere.&nbsp; The surest
proof and absolutely indisputable evidence can only be obtained
by allowing the sisters and the brothers whom I have previously
made reference about to gather in one location without the ominous
threat of reprisal from these legions of governmental
functionaries and permit us to conduct our religious services and partake
of our sacramental herb.&nbsp; Keep these devious lawmakers and
their henchmen from interfering with our practice of our faith in
the manner that we know has been passed to us from Abraham and
Isaac, Felix and Elijah, Moses, Joshua, and Daniel from his
lion's den.&nbsp; Peter, Paul, and Barnabas all going to this
great spiritual feast.&nbsp; And so many more that we cannot
say.&nbsp; Stop persecuting us for this moment and cease from
terrorizing our religious activities.&nbsp; Allow us to smoke our
ganja and we will surely manifest proof to the whole world that
we are a spiritual people, that ganja is our vehicle to the spiritual
realms of Zion, and that we, collectively, hold the keys to the
mysteries which have eluded humanity until this blessed dispensation.&nbsp;
What possible threat do we pose to these powers that be in this
wicked and degenerate kingdom that has led mankind to the very
brink of destruction?&nbsp; What possible threat can be posed by
a totally non-violent group of ganja smokers except that we can
expose the demons who lead the people into their corrupt devices
and hold them in a diabolical economic servitude.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">They fight the ganja and the ganja people because we are the only
ones who can truly liberate the human soul from the bondage of
sin and lead the march away from oppression, lust, and crime unto
the promised paradise that the sould longs for.&nbsp; This is why
they wage a war that they cannot win, not against cocaine and
heroin and the illicit prescription drugs which they manufacture
and control, but against nature and against God in the form of
the ganja.&nbsp; This is why they refuse to allow us the basic
liberty of practicing our religion with our sacrament.&nbsp; They
actually do not want proof because it is proof they would get.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Okay, Carl.&nbsp; I've babbled on enough for now, but I know that
you can grasp what it is that I am babbling about.&nbsp; We do
hold this mystery among us.&nbsp; And this is undoubtedly why I
continue to babble.&nbsp; This is only the tip of the iceberg.<br>

P.O. Box 1000 <br>
Lewisburg, PA 17837 </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Hello, dear Jeffery, and hearty greetings to
all you meet; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Thank you for the invigorating note that you most recently sent
to me and especially appreciate your saintly remembrance of Brian
and your thoughtful communication to him.&nbsp; I hope you are
aware that he is no longer in McKean FCI.&nbsp; He was accused of
inciting a riot there last October when the Federal prisons
across Amerika spontaneously erupted after congress refused to address
the harsh penalties meted out to crack (read black) users and distributors
as opposed to the powder cocaine sentences.&nbsp; Anyway, he's
been on lockdown ever since and is presently being housed in
Beckley, W. Va.&nbsp; He is a warrior. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I have no excuses, real or imagined, why I have not been more
prompt in returning a letter to you.&nbsp; I do thank you for
reminding me that I am full of shit, lest at any time I should
happen to overlook such an obvious bit of information.&nbsp;
Besides, I like it when you talk dirty to me :-).&nbsp; I will
say that I have thought of you on numerous occasions and even
reminded myself that I should respond to your letters and
acknowledge receipt of your gift to me of the book &quot;Green
Gold,&quot; but, alas, I had no movement of my spirit to exercise my
pencil hand until just now and I am grateful for the stimulation
that you provided.&nbsp; By the way, in answer to your question,
there is nothing that you either said or did that pissed me off
in any way.&nbsp; It has been a long time since anyone has pissed
me off by anything that they have said to me or about me.&nbsp; This
does not mean, however, that I am incapable of reacting to verbal stimulus,
for this is one of my favorite pursuits of interest -- to react
verbally to something someone has said or done.&nbsp; Hammering
what I consider to be hypocrisy or ignorance or any number of
other moral infirmaties always gives me great pleasure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I am always interested in updates about any and all or our former
assocates in the Coptic experience and also all of those who were
considered to be merely fringe performers, imposter performers,
or bad performers who were excommunicated from the fellowship of
kindred minds (?) pecking order because of some perceived
blasphemy in the mind of the spiritually tyrannical Nyah Bingi
Man.&nbsp; I find all of these characters, or whichever category
they may be classified, to be of great interest to me.&nbsp; As I
review each individual that I came in contact with as a result of
this spiritual movement, which somehow evolved into the
ganja-smuggling juggernaut known as Coptic, I find that almost unanimously
these people were motivated to do what they did by a sincere belief
that they were drawing themselves closer to the will of the true
and living God.&nbsp; When many were the recipients of critical
&quot;fire,&quot; and some even permanently ostracized from the
right hand of God or banished to a limbo or non-descript
banality, it was more devastating than anything they could have previously
imagined.&nbsp; They examined themselves, thought that their
intentions were simply to know God and to attempt to purify
themselves, and suddenly they found themselves alienated from
their adopted spiritual family and stamped with the accursed
designation of &quot;fuckery.&quot;&nbsp; All because they did
not fit into the extremely limited parameters of Keith's cadre of
sycophants and mindless robots.&nbsp; No one could stand up to
that spiritually powerful asshole who rode roughshod over <u>his</u>
kingdom of ass-kickers who readily and willingly stepped on each
other in order to draw closer to his and Wally's fiegned
holiness.&nbsp; Meanwhile, these two guys were fucking dozens of
women, each under the guise of sanctifying them.&nbsp; I won't go
into all the horrifying hypocrisy that occurred under the Coptic
banner.&nbsp; And even though all were guilty of plenty of sins
during the 4, 3, and 8 era, only Keith and Wally were in a
position to lead and, thus, they are ultimately responsible for
the catastrophe whose fruit is the rottenness we now behold among
all those of use who vowed to &quot;Let perfect love and
friendship reign, through all eternity.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I am not condemning anyone.&nbsp; I am merely stating what
happened even though I am not going into an in depth analysis of
the overwhelming corruption that resulted.&nbsp; If, perhaps, you
will allow me to make a little analogy.&nbsp; Think of a minefield
that lies in the path of a group objective which promises
unimagined euphoria for all those involved.&nbsp; There is no way
of circumventing the hazards posed by the lethal mines.&nbsp;
Someone, or maybe even a few, must encounter the minefield
head-on, exploding the deadly obstacles, and, by this foray into uncharted
territory of vanity, clear a path that can safely be trod by all
those who come after.&nbsp; Once this path has been cleared, can
we pretend that nothing has happened?&nbsp; Do we pretend that
those who were blown apart by the mines are still among us in one
piece because we do not want to accept that they are mutilated
beyong recognition?&nbsp; Do we then refuse to proceed to the
safety and joy of the promised euphoria?&nbsp; This may not be
the most enlightened symbolism that could be posed, but I'm sure
you can comprehend what it is that I'm inferring. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When first we became aware of the existence of the spiritual
light, a group of us gathered in a place near Papine, in St.
Andrew Parish near Kingston, Jamaica.&nbsp; There was a
manifestation in the embodiment of a guy we knew as Brother Ivy,
one George Baker Ivy.&nbsp; Only a small number of the sisters
and brothers who would at some later times and dates become
associated with this movement actually say and experienced the
vibration of that man during those few short months.&nbsp; This
in no way indicates any special hierarchy because of this
experience or as a result of a lack of this experience.&nbsp; It
is simply, throught the best effort of my memory and my honest
portrayal of the understanding of those events, what
happened.&nbsp; I have a detailed story of how it was that I arrived
at Papine on March 8, 1971, but suffice to say that I was
directed there by Nathan and Cynthia, generally, and, more
specifically, by Howard after I arrived in Miami. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I travelled alone and, when I reached the humble &quot;camp&quot;
in the wilderness I was initially greeted by Ivy, himself, and a
small group of men constructing a foul coup.&nbsp; When I
proceeded to the actual building that was the church, I encountered
Tommy, Gary, Alan, and a fellow named Herbie inside.&nbsp; Herbie was
run off by Keith after Ivy's death for the inforgivable
transgression of trimming his hair.&nbsp; Tommy, Gary, and Alan
became Keith's chosen heirs after his death to the accumulation
of the physical attainments of the ganja enterprise.&nbsp;
Ironic, to say the least.&nbsp; Anyway, Marvin and Andy, Nathan
and Cynthia, Brad, Jake, Sarah, Bobby, Tommy, Howard, Gary, Alan,
Bighead Stevie, Judy, Cliff, myself, and some others who may not
have remained among us for too long attended the spiritual feast
hosted by Ivy.&nbsp; A bevy of African-descendant Jamaicans were
also in attendance, some sporadic and some daily.&nbsp; Keith,
Wally, Dougie (Samson), Kootman, Shine, Blossom, and Flowers were
but a few of these Jamaicans. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Without question; not even the slightest, unmurmured question;
the show, the stage, the script, the spirit, and all of the bit
actors and actresses belonged to Ivy.&nbsp; There was one
pervading and prevalent premise that permeated every singly being
that I personally encountered during this time.&nbsp; This was
not something that was told to you or to anyone upon their
arrival, but once someone had discerned for themselves what was
spiritually taking place, then the accepted premise was openly
discussed by all of those who had what was considered to be <u>that</u>
discernment.&nbsp; What was <u>that</u> discernment?&nbsp; Quite
simply and unequivocally that Ivy was the resurrected spirit of
the Christ spoken of in the scriptures.&nbsp; Quite simply and
irrevocably that Ivy was the embodiment of that divine and holy
spirit which has become known to mankind as the savior of humanity,
the annointed one.&nbsp; Of this one fact there was no
dispute.&nbsp; Of this one fact there was no doubt.&nbsp; Of this
one fact all of those people whom I have previously mentioned
were in agreement.&nbsp; Whatever any of them may say now, or
whatever any of them may have said or done subsequent to the
man's departure from that body, I assure you with every morsel of
consciousness that may exist within me and I vow a solemn oath to
you on the blood coursing through my veins that all of these
people, along with myself, confessed with our mouths that this
man, Ivy, was the Christ.&nbsp; <u>No one</u> challenged his
authority as the only begotten son of that omnipotent God.&nbsp;
I, personally, spoke to Keith of this spiritual phenomenon and
he, as my spiritual equal and brother at that time, wholeheartedly
applauded my awakening and nurtured me personally in the self evident
truth that we were both privy to.&nbsp; It was only after the
death of Ivy and a period of youthful uncertainty and stumbling
that Keith asserted his sagacious knowledge of our blind trust
and became our master rather than our brother. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I will not delve into this transition at length because it is a
matter that each person must acknowledge for themselves.&nbsp; If
each person, both man and woman, examines their personal story of
how they first because aware of this spirit that continues to
bind us in the most unusual manner, then I am certain that they
will be able to link their spiritual awakening, and whatever
awareness they may possess, directly to Ivy.&nbsp; It is a fact
which must be.&nbsp; Whomever you first heard about this thing
called &quot;Doctrine&quot; from can be traced to Ivy.&nbsp; It matters
not whom this person was or these persons were.&nbsp; None of us
can claim ownership of this message of salvation, of these words
or consolation.&nbsp; If, perchance, we were fortunate enough to
be a momentary vessel of the precious promise, this divine
covenant, then let us give thanks.&nbsp; And since we have all
been the recipients of this holy hope of perfect love, then let
us give thanks.&nbsp; We have quibbled for too long.&nbsp; Time
is really gliding on.&nbsp; I can think of no reason to hold on
to animosity for anyone, least of all any of the sisters and the
brothers who share the common hope of the redemption from sin and corruption
that we share.&nbsp; At the same time, I cannot with a clear
conscience whitewash the past into something that is not
true.&nbsp; Once we acknowledge what has happened, either
specific deeds which we have done or the cosmics that we have
collectively experienced, we will be free to laugh and to sing
and to praise.&nbsp; Otherwise, we are bound spiritually from
beholding the glory which we do possess individually and, to a
much greater extent, collectively. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When you, Jeff, expressed bewilderment in one of your previous
letters so long ago concerning the declaration which I made about
Ivy's divinity; that all things have authority only as they are
viewed in the light of his divine sonship, that Ivy is the sone
of God and that this and only this lends credence to any claims
that we may make; I was absolutely flabbergasted by your
incredulity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It really shows how far we all strayed from when first we saw the
light.&nbsp; That someone like yourself, and many others of the
brothers and sisters who came among this congregation after Keith
had usurped control of all of our destinies, could be around
Brad, Jake, Cliff, Tommy, Big Al, etc., etc., etc., and me and not
be acutely aware of Ivy and the indisputable aura of his divinity
which made all of this spirituality that we know and love
possible is a testament to our shamefulness.&nbsp; We should all
hide our nakedness by diving into the valley of disbelieving
unfaithfulness.&nbsp; It is a good thing that God is merciful and
laughs at our frailties. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Keith turned us against each other for the love of filthy
lucre.&nbsp; Wally pretended to be a high priest with the
regimented and mandatory hours of prayer.&nbsp; I know that their
attempts to place themselves on a plateau above their brethren
and sisters was an act of treachery and spiritual
wickedness.&nbsp; All that multiple wife shit was a cloak for
satisfying their lusts.&nbsp; They both, Keith and Wally,
willingly sacrificed their brethren and sisters lives so that
they could fulfill their own vain interpretations of the
scripture with them as Moses, Aaron, Peter, James, and John all
of the other starring roles.&nbsp; What assholes!&nbsp; Keith befriended
the nasty gunmen and actually catered to those murdering scoundrels.&nbsp;
The litany of these types of events goes on and on.&nbsp; My hand
is tired.&nbsp; Did you ever notice how few new people came
amongst us as anything other than casual observeres or money
grubbers during their tenure? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the few short months of Ivy's resurrection, a reverberation
transmitted itself to and through literally hundreds of souls and
links them together even today after more than twenty-five years
of various turmoils. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">All of those who would profess to be loyal adherents to the
vanity of the Coptic trip of Keith and company should remember
that the man died alone, most probably of A.I.D.S., shitting up
himself and without the service of even a hot cup of tea.&nbsp;
This seems a cold tribute, but true nevertheless.&nbsp; The poor
guy had to suffer unimaginable loneliness in his last days on
earth and because I knew him well and loved him, I feel the
horrifying emotions that abide outside of the realms of sincere
thanksgiving that have at times overtaken all of us. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Someone had to walk through the minefield to clear away all of
the fatal flaws of a spiritual mortal.&nbsp; These vanities have
been exposed and they can never again withstand the light of
awareness.&nbsp; Some may desire to retain a hierarchy of
hypocrisy but it has become no longer acceptable to a consciousness
that is determined to give glory where glory is due, to give
honor where honor is due.&nbsp; These accolades belong to God
who, though in us all, is far above us all.&nbsp; Man, primarily
man and not so much woman, in his vanity to proclaim himself to
be God has erred continually and abundantly by forgetting and
neglecting the true attributes of the divine nature -- humility,
long-suffering, the joy of service, and a few more that I'm sure
you can recall.&nbsp; Humble yourself and the spirit will cheer
you, humble yourself and you will walk with God.&nbsp; By the
way, despite all the spiritual vibrancy that Ivy exuded, he was a determined
servant to us all and, although regal in every aspect of his
being, he managed to instill spiritual awareness and infailing
charismatic magnetism in all of us that experienced his
resurrection.&nbsp; It was so powerful that we were able to transmit
this purity to others in spite of our own delicate
condition.&nbsp; Again, I remind you, the consciousness that you
possess concerning your own spiritual being can be traced
directly to Ivy through one of his emissaries that I have previously
written about.&nbsp; The seed of the precious fruit was Ivy and
that whole Coptic experience was a diversion from the purity of
that holiness.&nbsp; All of our enthusiasm, all of our exuberance
from the discovery of the font of life, all of our dedication to
do the will of God, all of our desire to serve was recognized by
Keith and selfishly channelled into a smuggling operation which
ultimately brought great riches to Keith and a few others but
finally caused the alienation of the sistes and the brothers
toward each other, Carl &quot;Z-man&quot; Swanson's death, and
prison sentences for a large number of the brothers.&nbsp; So
many things come to my mind about that absolute travesty
masquerading as godliness that it is impossible to even begin to
relate the depths of deceitfulness which occurred among us in
such a limited purview as a short letter.&nbsp; Tomes, with input
from all of the participants, would be required to get the proper
perspective or, perhaps, endless hours of truthful reasoning
would help expose everyone's persistent desire to mask our
participation in a fraudulent counterfeit after we had experienced
and handled the genuine article. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Where does all of this leave us now?&nbsp; Just exactly where we
are.&nbsp; Each of us has a few brothers and sisters from that
spiritual age with whom we communicate and/or associate.&nbsp;
Then, generally speaking, there is a larger number of brothers
and sisters from the said era with whom no contact or association
is desired.&nbsp; This category is loathed, coveted, or presumed
to be cursed for some self-serving reason which only the
individual, themself, knows.&nbsp; This completely illogical,
nasty, and unchristianlike reasons to harbor ill-will may have
even stemmed from a time when Keith or Wally, sitting on their spurious
throne of judgment, pronounced that the poor brother or sister in question
was, indeed, &quot;fuckery.&quot;&nbsp; Of course, this lent
justification to depise the dear soul into eternity.&nbsp; How
ludicrous and downright mean-spirited are these nerds?&nbsp; And
they want someone to take them seriously.&nbsp; Even their prayer
is sin.&nbsp; And the longer and the more persistently stubborn
someone opts to be in holding onto these unclean spirits, the
more insistent that someone determines to be in defending the
wickedness of that exclusionary little club of scurrilous nincompoops,
then the longer it will be before we can &quot;Behold how good
and how pleasant it is for sisters and brothers to dwell together
in unity.&quot;&nbsp; And that does not mean everyone living in
one house while other houses stand empty awaiting a cache of
smuggled ganja. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I cannot predict how it should be or how it will be or how it
won't be.&nbsp; I am, however, absolutely confident that when
people genuinely love one another, then they can solve any
problems which may arise with ease and minimal effort.&nbsp; You
cannot condemn someone that you love!&nbsp; Leave those weighty matters
to God.&nbsp; We can resist any evil behavior so that it does not
enter into our <u>own</u> realm or action, but we must always be
ready to forgive, especially those we <u>know</u> to be
sojourners with us on this path whose destination leads us to a
perfect praise of that perfect spirit that we have tasted of and
known.&nbsp; Outside of this simple, realistic desire to achieve
this acceptable demeanor, all else results in vanity and vexation
of the spirit. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">That was a pretty long-winded dissertation about a subject that
is so long in the past.&nbsp; See what your short note to me
inspired.&nbsp; And believe me, I really had to restrain myself
lest a more scathing analysis of our collective present condition
had poured forth. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This past summer was noteworthy to me because of some very nice encounters
that Judy was fortunate enough to experience.&nbsp; She
thoroughly enjoyed each one and realizes how uplifting the
special bond is between all of these old characters. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Over the 4th of July she went up to Billie's and Pop's house with
Jane Swanson and Irene (Chuck's wife).&nbsp; Gary and Eileen were
there and Bobby.&nbsp; Sweet reminiscing and a touch of
spontaneous praise. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Nate and Cynthia and Marvin and Andy visited here in Iowa City
and, of course, the subject was our mutual experience and the
blessedness of this holy spirit that we know and love. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jane and Joel came though Iowa with Blossom and Big Bob in tow
and spent a short time together on some land that Jane has in
southern Iowa.&nbsp; Plenty of kids, Rich Cone, and a few other
folks who had experienced this spirit but were never considered a
part of the fellowship because they didn't have Keith's sanction.&nbsp;
They didn't even know him, but are a part of that spirit family nonetheless.&nbsp;
Plenty of stories and updates always accompany each of these folks
about other of the brothers and sisters whom we may not have been fortunate
enough to see just yet.&nbsp; All are languishing, whether they
realize it or not, for the company of their spiritual
sibblings.&nbsp; All are languishing to see the saints and to
harmonize with others of this limitless family of Ivy's
offspring.&nbsp; All await, whether consciously or
subconsciously, for the fullfillment of that promise that we
heard when first we saw the light. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Samson claims, via Nate and Cindy, that he should be the elder
who is heir to whatever remains of the skeletal bones of the
Coptic and that he wants the St. Thomas property only to have a
place for the brothers and sisters to congregate when and if they
are ever moved to do such a thing. :-)&nbsp; I can only speak for
myself.&nbsp; I have everything that I had hoped for when I first
heard this blessed promise.&nbsp; I can actually sing psalms and
I love to do it even though at present it is an exercise I
perform alone.&nbsp; If this is my sole inheritance, I know that
I am blessed.&nbsp; I have the armaments to carry me through any
battle from both enemies within and enemies without.&nbsp; I
remember Samson as a real jovial and uplifting character at
certain times.&nbsp; When he started his routine about Mr. Mach-a-vah
come from afar riding on his pimbacarry he could certainly entertain
anyone.&nbsp; His rendition of &quot;From Greenland's Icy
Mountains&quot; is truly divine.&nbsp; His long-suffering is not
forgotten.&nbsp; But then, as with all of us, there are certain
aspects of his personality that must be left behind because we
all know that &quot;You cannot get to Zion with a carnal
mind.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In any event, we march on to tomorrow.&nbsp; Who can say what it
will bring?&nbsp; We maintain our individual hopes.&nbsp; We
know, and God certainly knows, what it is that we truly hope for. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If I have provided you with a little food for your spirit to
process, then I am glad.&nbsp; If not, then I am almost as
glad.&nbsp; I know that your hope is a blessed hope simply from
the things which you say and my limited knowledge of your activities. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I can see good in each of the oldtime sisters and brothers.&nbsp;
I sincerely long to see each one of them and to probe the regions
of Zion that we have journeyed to in times post.&nbsp; I suspect
that we are all a bit more familiar with the surroundings this
time around and will not get lost so easily. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When Judy was with Gary and the rest that I previously mentioned
at Billie's place near Chicago last summer, Gary reminisced about
a recent moment that he had spent with Tommy and some others in
Miami.&nbsp; He said something like, &quot;If Tommy is ever
released from the feds ominous threat of another trial that 'all hell
will break loose',&quot; meaning that &quot;Bro. Louv&quot; will
somehow resurrect into the awesome reviver of the Coptic
legacy.&nbsp; I say Tommy is not going to bust even a single
grape until he acknowledges the Vanity Fair of the whole Coptic episode
and refreshes his memory concerning the enormous vitality that he
was infused with by Ivy in the very beginning.&nbsp; He must stop
pretending to be the Apostle Paul or Brother Louv and just be
content with being Brother Tommy who, in reality, is one of the
most lovely and lovable creatures of all time. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Cliff sent a message via E-mail to Carl asking the rhetorical
question, &quot;What happened to the brethren?&quot;&nbsp; If
anyone has even the slightest comprehension concerning what
really happened to the sisters and the brothers, I suspect it would
be old Cliff.&nbsp; How ironic that Tommy and Cliff have been
within a few miles of each other for over 10 years and each has
their own reasons for remaining aloof.&nbsp; I know them both
quite well and love each for his stubborn faithlessness.&nbsp;
Come on down, boys and girls, there is no difference here.&nbsp;
I love the memory of each, for that is all that I have.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I remain, then, the old goat who has lost his bleat, -- Jim </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Louv brother Carl,</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I know that it's been a little while since I
returned something for the last letter you sent me but sometimes
I'm just not in the letter writing mood plus there's not much new
to tell you anyway.&nbsp; It's still the same old fuckery going
on here, it seems like everytime the guards change shifts (the
police change every quarter so we get a few new assholes every
three months) we have to go through a bunch of extra shit until
we break them in or else we just get used to them and learn how
to work around the assholes.&nbsp; It's funny how people learn to
adapt to most any situation and one thing that's good about
suffering is that it forces people to stand together that would
be hating each other under normal circumstances.&nbsp; I also
like to believe the old cliche that &quot;Suffering builds character.&quot;&nbsp;
Sometimes I do wonder though if people that suffer get any reward in
the long run because you see people all over the earth suffering
and they never get any relief.&nbsp; Who knows maybe they get
some kind of blessing that we can't see but like you said
&quot;God is with those with the biggest armies or the most
money.&quot;&nbsp; Of course there has to be suffering to change
wrongs that are being done and when you're suffering for a cause
or something you believe in it can give you a certain pride and
dignity that is a blessing in itself.&nbsp; The difference
between people who know what they're suffering for and people who don't
are like night and day, people that go into suffering sacrificing
and giving up small pleasures to make things better (or a hope of
making things better) in the long run get a self worth and self
respect that is like no other.&nbsp; It's a feeling that a person
gets when they know that they might have some effect on the future
of or on the betterment of the human race.&nbsp; It's this spirit
or desire to change things that has made man progress this far
and have made man willing to give up their lives if necessary for
something they believe in.&nbsp; So my point is that maybe the
blessing that one gets for suffering is the feeling of
satisfaction or self worth that a person feels or maybe suffering
is something that is necessary to make man learn how to live
together in peace and how to better themselves in the long
run.&nbsp; Maybe that's why the Bible says that we should &quot;Bear
our suffering with joy,&quot; maybe our little minds can't
comprehend the blessing that we get because we can't see the big
picture of how mankind benefits through our suffering. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Brother Jeffery wrote me a letter and sent me a few old pictures
the other day which was very nice of him to take the time to
do.&nbsp; However, some of the thanks goes to you because he said
that it was through your letters (or maybe it was through the
&quot;Internet computer system&quot; because he also said
something about that) that he learned that I wanted some old
pictures.&nbsp; I wrote him back and thanked him and I also told
him what I thought led to the brothers' down fall and why I feel
that they haven't been able to resurrect anything.&nbsp; Even though
I was young I saw how things progressed, as I'm sure you know my father
was one of the first white brothers in Jamaica.&nbsp; I knew
brother Ivy, I lived at every house (except the one right before
his death) that &quot;Niah Keith&quot; (with brother Keith and
his family) ever lived at in Jamaica, his children were like brothers
and sisters to me.&nbsp; I lived with brother Wally, Brother
Cootman (that was sister Phyllis's father) and shit I even lived
at brother Dohgie's (Laurenton Dickens's) house (me being the <u>only</u>
white person there) in Bull Bay for about four months (I was
about 9 years old at the time) one time while my parents were in
America.&nbsp; I lived with my family in America at all the
places (I'm sure that you remember that my family lived up in
Maine) where they made the moves and <u>I was at all three</u> of
(the ranch, the Canal and Maine) the big busts and I went to a
juvenile (the Canal and Maine) home on two of them.&nbsp; I'm
just stating all of this to say that I was there from the
beginning (the beginning meaning when the white brothers first
went to Jamaica) so I saw how things manifested through
time.&nbsp; As I told brother Jeffery in my letter to him, the
thing that the brothers had in the beginning that drew them
together, the thing that made them able to work together and
accomplish so much in such a short time was the louv and unity
they had for each other in the beginning.&nbsp; After a while through
the hunger for power and greed certain ones set themselves up on
a pedestal (as big Bob would say &quot;The Elderberries&quot;)
and started to think that they were some how more holy than their
brother.&nbsp; It shifted from equality to some kind of a pecking
order where instead of looking out for their brothers &amp; sisters best
interest all they could do is play politics and think they were
better than other people.&nbsp; Really I think it's a disgrace
how the brothers ended up hating each other, no wonder not even
their own children wanted to live that kind of life style.&nbsp;
What ever you do you can't leave out the youth because young people
are the future so you have to teach them what you know.&nbsp;
That's another thing that the brothers did wrong, with all those
big smart Coptic Priests around it's funny how they didn't teach
the children shit, they should have at least taught us how to
drive those boats, if they would have maybe I wouldn't be here
right now. :-)&nbsp; As I said the only thing that the brothers
had at one time that made them different from the rest of the
world was the louv (that's the spirit that, if used in the right
frame of mind, ganja enhances) so when they lost that for each
other they couldn't set an example for or draw anyone.&nbsp; For the brothers
to ever come together in a spirit again they have to put aside
all the bad thought and hatred that they carry for each
other.&nbsp; How did the old saying go?&nbsp; &quot;Think right
love and pray and you'll live in rejoicing every day.&quot;&nbsp;
Louv is what the world is lacking and that's the key.&nbsp;
Fighting for the freedom of ganja is good but if you can't
display and give people the understanding of the frame of mind
that you're supposed to be in when you smoke it then people might
get the wrong concept (especially young people) of the spirit
that it induces and go on to abuse it just like most everyone
else does.&nbsp; Ganja is a medicine it can be easily
abused.&nbsp; I believe that in the beginning the brothers had
the spirit that the herb enhances but as time went on they lost
that spirit and ganja became the focal point (I know that I
abused it) and that's when they started to abuse it.&nbsp; It doesn't
do any good to point the finger at anybody because we all make mistakes
in life, (what was the old saying, &quot;We all sin and fall
short of the glory of God&quot;) so the idea is to lift each
other and try not to make those same mistakes again.&nbsp; Maybe
one day after the brothers get beat hard enough they'll forget
about the bad feelings that they carry for each other and come
together and have some fun.&nbsp; I'm not going to hold my breath
though. :-(<br>

<p>September 6, 1996 </p>

<p>Carl, </p>

<p>I found a few minutes to write <a href="jim-02.html"> a few
lines</a> to <a href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/harkin01.html"> Tom
Harkin</a>.&nbsp; I don't have much confidence, as you probably
know, in either the judicial or the legislative branches of the
U.S. Government.&nbsp; I tried to be brief and to the point and,
as you will see in reading the enclosed copy, I did not attempt
to employ diplomacy.&nbsp; It is difficult for me to see any of
these politicians, lawyers, judges, etc. as being the least bit
compassionate or even attempting to understand people who use
herb or advocate the use of herb. If these elected officials
sincerely believed that the herb is evil, I could more readily
accept their mealy-mouthed stance against its use in any
capacity.&nbsp; But I am thoroughly convinced of their conscious
participation in a heartless, esoteric ploy, the goal of which is
known by these fraudulent marionettes who masquerade as my
representative and who pretend to have my well-being as the
motive of their profession.&nbsp; I know that this is a lie and
that they represent the interests of those who have enabled them
to achieve the lofty position that is indicated by their
particular title.&nbsp; Pain and suffering are not their concern
unless it happens to befall them or their families. I'm sure my
letter will do neither good nor harm for <a
href="../../MEDICAL/HELMERS/helmers2.html"> Allen Helmers</a>'
tribulation because the political machine is determined to keep
marijuana from the people at all cost and these demons will treat <a
href="../../MEDICAL/HELMERS/helmers1.html"> Mr. Helmers</a> with
the same bloodstained hands with which the have slain so many
before him. I invoked the names of Jake and <a
href="../tropic.html"> Tommy</a> because the incident actually
took place and because there are warriors in this great conflict
who know something about this subject and they are both armed
with the spiritual weapons that can make these imposters
regurgitate.&nbsp; When and if they resurrect these dreadful
swords of the spirit is a question I am incapable or
addressing.&nbsp; We both know that some elementary exercises in
humility and some very real and elementary exorcisms of vanity,
pride, and ill-will are required on an individual basis before we
can once again proclaim with conviction, &quot;One God for us
all.&quot; Judy has spent some time this summmer with many
seemingly incompatible spirits from days gone by.&nbsp; Sisters
Billie, Eileen, Jane S., Jane Z., Blossom, Irene L., Cynthia,
Andy, Chris N., and probably a few more I cannot recall.&nbsp;
Brothers Booblius, Rich Cone, Nate, Marv, Chuck L., Joel Z., and
I know some others who slip my mind - Pops and Gary to name
two.&nbsp; Bobby Kleine, too.&nbsp; Plus having talked to Lancer
on the phone and having heard about dozens more via the old
grapevine.&nbsp; Several Jamaicans having joined Stevie
Kleinschmidt on the journey over yonder.&nbsp; Judy loved the
company of each one and longs to talk and sing with as many more
as would be physically possible because she feels a &quot;special
bond&quot; with all of these fine folks.&nbsp; No shit!!&nbsp; I
wonder why?&nbsp; Could it be that we hold something in common
that is magical in its mystery and yet so real to all of
us?&nbsp; We are only depriving ourselves of something holy and
divine if we attempt to exclude anyone.&nbsp; No one need
worry.&nbsp; I can't come just yet, but sometime in May of 2024
I'll be there.&nbsp; Save me a seat, Carl.&nbsp; Better get right
with God, come and do it now, and at the cross of King Alpha and
Queen Omega we lay our burden down!&nbsp; No one is better than
anyone else and, thank God, no one is any worse.&nbsp; What a
glory when we'll all be there.&nbsp; Have I lost my mind?&nbsp; I
actually do love all these characters, and more.&nbsp; Keep up
the good work. <a href="../ganjaman.html"> Jim</a> </font></tt> </p>

<P>Hello Carl,
<DD>Please ignore the surplus Hallmark.&nbsp;  It was free from the chapel so I picked up a few.&nbsp;  I am, however, happy for you because it seems a worthwhile expenditure of the happy emotion.
<DD>I thank you for your continued consideration of an old goat like unto <A HREF="../ganjaman.html"> myself</A>.&nbsp;  I appreciate your thoughtful assistance toward my postal expenditures and I am well supplied with stamps even though I have been a bit negligent in communicating with those that I should be communicating with and also with several folks who, more than likely, have no desire whatsoever in hearing from me.&nbsp;  Believe me.&nbsp;  My musings and my meditations are not of a type which would be extremely popular with the masses.&nbsp;  And they are not of a carnal nature, as I have by some act of divine grace been able to subdue those pesky, guilt-ridden little morsels of banality.&nbsp;  HOORAY!
<DD>I always enjoy receiving your newsletters and I laud your efforts to somehow make a reasonable argument of common sense to a set of religiously and politically indoctrinated, self-serving coterie of prejudiced money-grubbers whose motives are not righteous and who have redefined justice and liberty to suit themselves and their puppeteers.
<DD>But over all, what I have enjoyed the most from what you have sent to me were the letters from <A HREF="brian-02.html"> Brian</A> and your <A HREF="olsen-02.html"> replies</A>.&nbsp;  Whichever came first I do not know, and which was a reply I cannot say, but I will say that I am very proud to be Brian's father and his perception of humanity is very moving to me.&nbsp;  It was very kind of you to show an interest in the young man and to encourage him in the manner that you have.&nbsp;  I know he has to be uplifted whenever he receives any correspondence from anyone.&nbsp;  He has been persecuted to a draconian degree because of the herb and he has withstood all of these diabolical forces.&nbsp;  Regardless of what anyone may think about ganja and society's resistance to people like Brian and myself who refuse to acquiesce to the mischief that they say is law, we will most likely remain the stubborn, stupid, quixotic dolts that we are until they succeed in squeezing the life out of us.
<DD>Judy has been seeing a lot of the old <A HREF="../sixtymin.html"> brothers and sisters</A> over the past several months and she has been completely delighted in the company of each and every one of them even though some animosities and a variety of misunderstanding seems to linger between various cliques so to speak.&nbsp;  Is it possible that these old characters could ever be of one heart, one aim, one destiny as well all professed when first we saw the light?&nbsp;  Of course it is possible.&nbsp;  Is it probable?&nbsp;  Only the bookmakers know the odds on that one.&nbsp;  When Cliff sends you the cryptic little question, "What happened to the brethren?" I suspect that this is simply a rhetorical question disguised as some great mystery.&nbsp;  I suspect we all have some clue as to what happened to us as individuals and also what happened to us as a collective group.&nbsp;  There were also many sisters.&nbsp;  So the question is not simply, "What happened to the brethren?"&nbsp;  More aptly, "What happened to the sisters and the brethren?"&nbsp;  Note: I now put the ladies before the hairy reasoners.
<DD>I received the Garvey book.&nbsp;  Thanks!&nbsp;  I will write something to the Senator and I'll send you a copy.&nbsp;  I love you all very much and almost all of my thoughts are of the HOOD.&nbsp;  Female & male.&nbsp;  Jane Zimmerwoman is a great gal.&nbsp;

<P>Dear Carl
<DD>Hope all is well.&nbsp;  I haven't heard from you for a long time.
<DD>I recently heard about a recent 8th Circuit decision pertaining to a group of Rastas having the right to a freedom of religion defense in regards to possession of some marijuana they were growing.
<DD>I assume that you published part of the decision in the Iowa NORML newsletter.&nbsp;  The last newsletter I have from you is the fall of 1995.&nbsp;  Please send me your latest newsletter containing the said decision if possible.
<DD>I recently returned from a trip to Florida.&nbsp;  While there I read some articles in Hemp Magazine out of Texas.&nbsp;  The articles were implying that the DEA was overstepping its authority when they opposed farmers in Colorado trying to get the right to grow hemp for commercial purposes.&nbsp;  The DEA also goes public declaring that marijuana is not a medicine & even had an agent at a protest against a radio station in Massachusetts that was playing marijuana songs.&nbsp;  The article was saying that the DEA is paid to enforce the law not make it.
<DD>Do you think that a class action lawsuit against the DEA on behalf of the sick & dying, the farmers who want to grow hemp commercially, the environmentalists who know hemp is good for the environment, those who would use marijuana as a spiritual sacrament, etc., is feasible?
<DD>Looking forward to hearing from you on this matter.
<DD>Jeff

<P>July 23, 1996

<P>Louv Brother Brian,

<P><DD>Thanks for <A HREF="brian-01.html"> the letter</A>.&nbsp;  Thanks also for the comments on Judas, and for saying that I don't fit the role.&nbsp;  I wasn't suggesting that I play that role, I was merely addressing the fact that Christ loved Judas.&nbsp;  This goes to the part where Christ talked about loving your enemies and doing good to them that hate you and despitefully use you.&nbsp;  That was all I was getting at.&nbsp;  As for telling my story, I'm sure a lot of the old church members would consider my version a complete betrayal of everything they believe in.&nbsp;  I don't smoke the herb, for one thing.&nbsp;  I consider the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church to have fallen because of selling the herb.&nbsp;  I doubt very much if my views would be received with much sympathy from them.&nbsp;  What I was getting at was that I don't give Judas the opportunity to kill me.&nbsp;  I don't have any secrets which cannot be revealed.&nbsp;  I've certainly done some embarrassing things that would make me feel ashamed to speak of them in public, but nothing that would put me (or anyone else) in a prison cell.&nbsp;  I agree that Judas ended up destroying himself because of his actions, but it wasn't because Christ held any bad feelings toward him.&nbsp;  You can rejoice in the knowledge that anyone who treats you treacherously will live in torment, although I'm not exactly sure that's something to rejoice over.&nbsp;  I'd prefer it if people didn't act treacherously at all.&nbsp;  I try not to give them the opportunity.&nbsp;  At any rate, I was simply looking at things from my own perspective.&nbsp;  I stopped smoking the herb so that no one would have control over me, particularly the informer.&nbsp;  I suppose an informer could make something up from imagination, but at least it would be a lie.&nbsp;  The way I was living before, the informer could have told the truth, like Judas, and put me away for a long time.&nbsp;  I'll admit that it takes more than an informer's word sometimes (although not all the time, since your dad is living proof of that), but usually it takes some actual evidence to back it up.&nbsp;  In my case, an informer could say I was breaking the law, but it would be difficult to prove it, since I don't.&nbsp;  I'm looking to partake of my sacrament openly, or at least legally.&nbsp;  I could do that in Holland, and I may move there some day.&nbsp;  I think we should all be thinking about the very real world we live in, instead of isolating ourselves in some camp somewhere and selling herb to everyone to pay for it (a recipe for disaster, in my opinion).&nbsp;  Prison taught me one thing, and that was that God was not on my side.&nbsp;  As Marcus Garvey so wisely said, God doesn't take sides.&nbsp;  Garvey liked what Napoleon had to say about it, "God is on the side with the biggest battalion."&nbsp;  So far, we don't even have a security guard any more.&nbsp;  I'd say we have some organizing to do.
<BR><DD>Thanks for the news about Stevie.&nbsp;  I think I heard about it from someone else - maybe it was you.&nbsp;  I agree that he was a good brother.&nbsp;  Keep in touch.
<P><DD>Sincerely,
<P><DD>Carl E. Olsen

<P>Louv Brother Carl,

<P><DD>As you know sometimes it takes me a while to find the inspiration to respond to letters, but I do make a mental note of it and always do try to get around to it eventually.&nbsp;  My conscience starts to bother me (which I believe is Goud's spirit working inside of a person) when I don't take the time to reciprocate or show some kind of appreciation for a letter or something someone has done for me.&nbsp;  Anyway, I received <A HREF="olsen-01.html"> your letter</A> and as always I do enjoy hearing from you.&nbsp;  Now to comment on some of the things in <A HREF="olsen-01.html"> your letter</A>.&nbsp;  First let me say that I don't mind at all you sending some copies of <A HREF="brian-01.html"> my last letter</A> to some of the brothers or even if you put it on "Internet," really I'm flattered that you think it's good enough and that other people would actually be interested in reading it.&nbsp;  I didn't think that my letter writing skills were that good especially since I just learned (one good thing I got out of coming to prison) how to half-way write a letter in the last couple of years.&nbsp;  Plus I never did call anyone's name (in the personal things I wrote) so I don't see where it could possibly do any harm.&nbsp;  Shit, in fact it might even do some good.&nbsp;  Maybe one of those "Assholes" that I was talking about will see it and their conscience (Goud) will start bothering them.&nbsp;  This brings us back to the topic of "Judas" which at one point in your letter (surprisingly) you compared yourself to.&nbsp;  Of course there is many ways that a "Judas" can manifest himself but I don't see where you would fit in any of those categories.&nbsp;  I don't know of any time where you sold out your brothers' or friends' trust, that you betrayed for personal gain, or to save you from some pain.&nbsp;  I don't know of any time when you and someone were in on something together and then you sold them out when the going got rough, or a time when you ever turned your back on a brother in need.&nbsp;  You've never pinned any person (by name) to any particular event.&nbsp;  Because you want to tell of your old experiences and adventures that doesn't make you a "Judas," plus you tell everyone straight up (since you've come to this frame of mind) not to tell you their secrets.&nbsp;  You try to stay away from people (all the old brothers that might have something to hide) that have secrets to prevent anything from ever being told.&nbsp;  Mind you, I don't necessarily agree with all of your views but I don't hold them against you and I damn sure don't look at you as a "Judas."&nbsp;  Now I'm going to comment on some of the other aspects of "Judas" and his judgment.&nbsp;  Let me ask you a question, Who do you think put it in "Judas'" heart to kill himself?&nbsp;  Wasn't it the love that Christ had and the goodness that he showed "Judas" that made his conscience (which I believe is the spirit of Goud that makes it hard for a man to live with his wickedness) bother him so much that he had to go kill himself?&nbsp;  If you believe that Goud works through man and knows the heart of every man then it was Goud who put it in his heart to kill himself.&nbsp;  I don't know if it's true or not but from what I understand suicide is the only sin that can't be forgiven.&nbsp;  So if you look at it from that perspective Goud did turn "Judas into dog meat."&nbsp;  I believe that the Bible is a parable book and the story of "Judas" just shows that a disloyal person has not been respected since the beginning of time.
<BR><DD>I don't know if you heard this or not but just in case you didn't "Brother Stevie" (A.K.A. "Broke Back") got killed, by a drunken driver, in St. Louis not too long ago.&nbsp;  I was sorry to hear it he was a good brother.&nbsp;  <BR><DD>From the dungeons of "Babylon" your brother always.
<BR><DD>Louv, Brian
<P>P.S. If you can send me another one of those "<A HREF="../tropic.html">Louv Story</A>" pamphlets.

<P>June 29, 1996

<P>Dear Brian,

<P><DD>Thanks for the letter.&nbsp;  I hope you don't mind if I send copies to some of the brothers and post it on my <A HREF="../coptic.html"> COPTIC page</A> on the World Wide Web (Internet).&nbsp;  I almost hesitate to publish it because of some of the very personal things you said, but I think you can explain them or retract them, as the case may be, so that it is only a manifestation of your thoughts at the time you wrote them.&nbsp;  The first issue you brought up that concerns me is your statement about hating "Judas."&nbsp;  I wonder if you think that Christ hated Judas.&nbsp;  My understanding has always been that Christ loved Judas just as much as the other disciples.&nbsp;  As a matter of fact, shortly after I stopped smoking ganja, I started calling myself "the informer," because I wanted people to know that I was no longer keeping any secrets.&nbsp;  If you have a secret, don't tell it to me.&nbsp;  Somewhere in the Bible it talks about there being no secret that will not be revealed.&nbsp;  I think there's another line about that which was spoken in secret will be shouted from the rooftops, or something like that.&nbsp;  When I stopped smoking ganja, I also keyed on the scripture where Christ tells his disciples that he will no longer partake of the sacrament until he partakes of it new with them in the kingdom of God.&nbsp;  We were always taught that you make heaven or hell out of your life here on earth, not somewhere up in the sky.&nbsp;  So that means that we have to make marijuana legal, or at least have the power to tell the world that we use it without being persecuted for it (that would be my idea of heaven on earth).&nbsp;  I think we can assume that Christ had the power to turn Judas into dog meat.&nbsp;  It was only Christ's obedience to his father that caused him to allow Judas to play the role that he did, to serve as a warning to the rest of us not to play Judas' role.
<P><DD>Thanks for letting me know what you've heard about Tom Reilly.&nbsp;  It's unreal how many years that man has been out on appeal bail.&nbsp;  I always figured that it was a government plot to keep him quiet (looks like it worked).&nbsp;  After all, he was the spokesman and he made them very uncomfortable by going on <A HREF="../sixtymin.html"> 60 Minutes</A> and giving all those <A HREF="../tropic.html"> media interviews</A>.&nbsp;  Anyway, it just goes to show you that the high will be brought low and the low will be brought high, and everything will even out in the end.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also interested in hearing about Brother Dogie, although the last time I talked to him (a year or two ago) he said he didn't want to be involved with the property at St. Thomas.&nbsp;  This is an unusual turn of events, although I guess I'm not surprised.&nbsp;  My reason for not wanting to have any connection to the property in St. Thomas is because I quit selling and smoking ganja.&nbsp;  As far as I'm concerned, that property in St. Thomas is just a dead weight.&nbsp;  It's the last remnant of a life that I left behind - a life that I've been trying to kill.&nbsp;  I have pity for poor Brother Dogie wanting to tie that dead weight around his own neck, but I guess that's just the way it all has to work out.&nbsp;  As for Jane, I'm sure she's just as happy as I am that she has nothing to do with it.
<P><DD>Thanks for Mike Hatfield's number.&nbsp;  I haven't gotten hold of him yet, but I'll keep trying.&nbsp;  Keep in touch and let me know what you think about my comments.
<P><DD>Sincerely,
<P><DD>Carl E. Olsen

<p><font size="4"><tt>June 22, 1996 </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Louv Brother Carl, </tt></font></p>

<p><DD><font size="4"><tt>First let me tell you that I did receive
both of your last packages and I did find the contents very
interesting, in fact that's just the kind of stuff that I've
wanted (I'm referring to the </tt></font><a href="../coptic.html"><font
size="4"><tt>literature</tt></font></a><font size="4"><tt> on the
brothers) because every time I try to explain to people how I
grew up it's hard for them to comprehend or relate to the full
picture of the spirit and mind set of the thing.&nbsp; Of course
they can all grasp and usually like the concept of smoking ganja
in Church but it's hard for them to understand (which was far more
important) the powerful spirit of louv and brotherhood that drew
the true brothers together.&nbsp; Even though everyone loved to
burn ganja that was not the main essence of the spirit, that just
intensified the spirit that was already there.&nbsp; I love to
burn herb and I know that you do too (we used to smoke it
together all the time) but that is not what makes us
brothers.&nbsp; What makes us brothers is that we care about and
try to uplift a fellow brother or sister in whatever little way
we can.&nbsp; Everyone might disagree on certain things but when
you can come together in unity and put aside your differences or compromise
on them I don't think that there is any greater feeling than that
and I believe that that was the essence of the brothers.&nbsp;
That spirit was even why the brothers were so successful in the
ganja movements, it's just sad that most of them carry bad
thought against or even hate each other now.&nbsp; Anyway, back
to the subject of trying to get people to try to understand the
kind of life that I grew up in, that's the reason why one time I
had asked you to send me some of the old pictures (since I know
that you were the main picture man) so that I could show them to people,
but I remember that you told me that you had left all of your old
pictures out at Jim's farm in Miami. :-(&nbsp; Now second, I want to
thank you for the money that you sent me, that was very kind and
thoughtful of you, I do appreciate it and I won't ever forget
it.&nbsp; Shit, that's two weeks at the commissary for me. :-)&nbsp;
Loyalty and devotion is also something that I learned to value
and respect from both growing up in the Church and, of course,
from my </tt></font><a href="../ganjaman.html"><font size="4"><tt>father</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt> which has always been a very loyal person.&nbsp;
Shit, I could have been out of prison a long time ago if I would have
wanted to sell out my so-called friends and brothers (I say
&quot;so-called&quot; because most of them wouldn't even take the
time to write me a letter now) but growing up the way I did
tought and instilled in me to hate &quot;Judas&quot; (informer)
which is a principle (even though most of the people that I was
loyal to didn't really appreciate it) that I'm happy I have
because I know that it's a principle that no amount of money in
the world can buy, either you have it or you don't.&nbsp; Still
even in the belly of the beast I have to count my
blessings.&nbsp; Speaking of bing in the &quot;Belly of the
beast&quot; I don't know if you know it of not but I'm still in
the &quot;Hole&quot; where I've been now for nine months now
(since October 24) and they say that I have nine more to
go.&nbsp; Yes, they've put me on &quot;Terrorist status&quot; and
they're trying to punish me hard for the riot that happened last
year.&nbsp; Of course, this is against their own law (in the BOP
rule book it says that it's a violation of our human rights to
keep us in segregation for any longer than 180 days) but they're
getting around their own laws by saying that we are a &quot;long
term hold over.&quot;&nbsp; As I'm sure you know the law was made
only for us, they can break them whenever they get ready, it's a
prime example of &quot;Just-us.&quot;&nbsp; Supposedly we are
waiting on bed space in a penitentiary but the truth is that we
are down here being punished over and over again.&nbsp;
&quot;This is definitely the bloodclot beast.
<DD>Now to bring you up to date on a little of the recent gossip on
some of your old brethren.&nbsp; I heard that the government was
revoking </tt></font><a href="../tropic.html"><font size="4"><tt>Brother
Louv</tt></font></a><font size="4"><tt>'s (new name &quot;Brother Nate&quot;)
appeal bond or whatever the fuck he was out of prison on, I had
thought that he was all finished with (especially since he's been
out so long) that bullshit but I guess that there is still
something hanging over his head.&nbsp; Anyway I heard that they
want him to go back to prison for a few months and then start on
his five years of parole.&nbsp; If that was his reason for not
wanting to talk to any of the old brothers they ended up fucking
him anyway and now he'll really have a good reason.&nbsp; Another thing
I heard is that brother (elderberry) Dogie was suing the brothers
for the farm up in St. Thomas because he says that &quot;He's the
last surviving elderberry so the farm is rightfully
his.&quot;&nbsp; It's really something how some brothers gave
their life to build the thing and then other ones reaped all the
rewards.&nbsp; I mean why wasn't sister Jane given a piece of the
land after brother Carl died?&nbsp; I don't know but I would say
that the elderberries were some real shit when it came to looking
out for their brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Oh yes, by the way, I
talked to Michael Hatfield (the lawyer) the other day and he
asked me if you were hooked up to the &quot;Internet computer
system&quot; which at the time I hadn't gotten your package yet
so I told him that I didn't know.&nbsp; Needless to say that it
was quite a coincidence when a couple of days after he asked me
that I received your package telling me about your </tt></font><a
href="../../"><font size="4"><tt>Internet</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt> work.&nbsp; Anyway he was curious to know what you
were doing lately so if you want to give him a call sometime
here's his phone number 352-669-2131.&nbsp; I would give you a
call but I only get one phone call every two weeks so I usually call
my Mother.&nbsp; Can you believe that the Warden here has the
same name as you?&nbsp; Maybe he's some family to you and you
could call him up and tell him to take it easy on me.
<DD>Well my brother I'm going to end this letter here but let me say
that I think the &quot;Internet&quot; thing is a good idea.&nbsp; Obviously
it's a good way to spread the word, you've already found a good
brother (</tt></font><a href="harrison.html"><font size="4"><tt>Christopher
Harrison</tt></font></a><font size="4"><tt>) that's hungry for
some true brothers and some doctrine, it sounds like he already
has the spirit.&nbsp; I'm not much of a letter writer but I'll
write him a letter as soon as I get caught up.
<DD>I thank you again for being a good brother to both me and my </tt></font><a
href="../ganjaman.html"><font size="4"><tt>father</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt>. <br>
<DD>Much louv and respect, <br>
<DD>your brother <br>
<DD>always, <br>

Dear Brother Olsen, <BR>
<DD>I am writing this letter to you to ask that more information
about my Father's first Family, The Coptic Church, be sent to me by mail
at 600 Lindsay Ave., Sacramento, CA 95838, under the name of Christopher
Harrison.&nbsp; I would also like to thank you for your work, which without I may never have been brought back to knowing my Father.&nbsp; For as long as I can remember, I have been studying the Bible (King James and various translations of it), trying to understand Him.&nbsp; Growing up in the Baptist Church (offspring of the orignial falsity, The Catholic Church), I had been taught, along with the rest of the lost spirits, that my Father is a mystery; and that He always will be a mystery to me.&nbsp; This ignorance has led me to believe in the status quo (evil), leading me into the life- (actually death-) time pursuit of being a lawyer.&nbsp; I had applied to law schools, thinking that, upon acceptance, I would be completed &amp; happy.&nbsp; (This went along with the belief that this was the sky God's will.)&nbsp; It was not until some days ago that I realized that this sky god is actually Satan, trying to lead me astray.&nbsp; <BR><DD>It was at this point that I realized the Light, and knew that I could not remain sinless in this world.&nbsp; I knew that Goud was real, and that my spirit needs to return to be among the Brethren, the Coptics.&nbsp; <BR>
<DD>I came to the Truth after months of prayer and sacrifice,
leading me to search for <A HREF="../../"> your page</A> on the Internet.&nbsp; When I first read it, I was convinced that there was truth in it; but it was not until I continued the search that I was able to confirm that it was all Truth through reading the passages of our forefathers (the Essenes and the Gnostics).&nbsp; It was during this time that I knew it was time for me to return to the ways of my Father.<BR>
<DD>As you may well understand, I am full yet not satisfied, in
want yet I have everything.&nbsp; I write to you because I now know what work my Father has for me: not to study the laws and precepts of those spirits who are bound by Satan, but to study the laws and ways of my ancestors.&nbsp; In this, I may continue towards knowledge and carry on His works.&nbsp; <BR><DD>So that I may begin my tutorship as soon as possible, I ask that your Honor would contact me immediately at (510) 631-3267.&nbsp; <BR>
<DD>Giving Honor and Praises to our <BR>
<DD>Most High, the Inner Spirit, our <BR>
<DD>Eternal Source of Life.&nbsp; <BR>
<DD>Your Servant and Brother <BR>
<DD>Forever, <BR>

<DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>October 1996</DIV>
<P><DIV ALIGN=LEFT>Dear Candidate,

<P><DD>Recent reports about increasing experimentation with drug use by teenagers are a cause for serious concern to everyone who cares about our kids.

<P><DD>After 80 years of drug prohibition, and more than 24 years since President Nixon declared a War on Drugs, it is clear that the best way for the nation to address drug use and abuse has not yet been identified.&nbsp;  The abuse of illegal drugs, and the resultant crime, police corruption, growth of gangs and drug cartels, and costs of enforcement point out the need to find a better way.&nbsp;  The Drug Policy Forum of Iowa is part of the national discussion on this crucial issue.

<P><DD>The Drug Policy Forum of Iowa is open to everyone, regardless of their current views on drug policy.&nbsp;  Our common goal is a desire to openly investigate the options.&nbsp;  We support a federal blue-ribbon commission to study the drug problem, review the work of previous commissions, and report its findings to the American people.

<P><DD>Through private dialogue and public debate, we hope to focus attention on drug policy and facilitate the building of a new consensus.&nbsp;  As one step in this process, we are asking candidates for state and federal office to complete the enclosed survey.&nbsp;  We understand that multiple-choice answers may not reflect everyone's views, so please feel free to write your own response to any question.&nbsp;  The purposes of this survey are to ascertain the range of views on drug policy, and to build a network of people who are interested in participating in further discussion of this issue.

<P><DD>Thank you for helping.

<P><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=350>Sincerely,

<h1>Just Say No (to Open Debate) </h1>

<h3>When it comes to alternatives to the drug war,<br>
some warriors would rather you not hear about it </h3>

<h2>By Bob Burtman </h2>

<p><font size="4"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="40">To some of those fighting on the front lines of
the war on drugs, open discussion can be as dangerous as bad
smack.&nbsp; Besieged by growing legions who favor the reform of
zero-tolerance drug laws -- including prominent conservative
judges, police chiefs, physicians and business men -- the say-no
foot soldiers are increasingly employing their favorite tactic:
discredit those who have opposing views. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Alan Robison holds a few of those views.&nbsp; A disinguished
professor of pharmacology and former department chair at the
University of Texas Health Science Center, Robison is the kind of
reform advocate drug warriors loathe, one with impeccable
credentials.&nbsp; And as president of the Drug Policy Forum of
Texas, a group seeking to broaden the debate, the professor poses
a special threat. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;The war on drugs is designed to use the criminal justice
system to make America drug free,&quot; Robison says.&nbsp;
&quot;It's a bad policy.&nbsp; It doesn't work.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Beyond agreeing that the drug war has been a failure, members of
the Forum and other advocacy groups hold varying ideas on what
should replace it.&nbsp; Some focus on easing harsh penalties for
simple possession.&nbsp; Others want to implement
&quot;harm-reduction&quot; strategies for treating drug abuse
that take a more realistic approach to addiction than zero
tolerance.&nbsp; Still others would legalize marijuana and
control its distribution.&nbsp; Robison himself stops well short
of calling for legalization, instead favoring a combination of
decriminalization and greater emphasis on education and
treatment. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">The Forum recently sponsored three debates at Rice University to
address the most pertinent questions on drug policy: Who should
lead the war on drugs, doctors or the police? Has the war done
more harm than good? Should drugs be legalized? To present a
cross section of opinion, Robison pulled together law officers,
public health officials and academics with widely diverging
views. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Prior to the first debate in late August, a number of panelists
received phone calls asking them not to participate.&nbsp; Though
most refused to back out, not all withstood the pressure.&nbsp;
Leonel Castillo, Mayor Bob Lanier's education liaison, had agreed
to moderate the second meeting but pulled out at the last
minute.&nbsp; According to Castillo, several people suggested he
not attend, though he wouldn't name names: &quot;I'd rather not
put anybody in a bind by suggesting they said I not do
that.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Assistant police chief Art Contreras, whose purview includes
narcotics investigations for HPD, was likewise unwilling to
identify those who asked him not to honor his commitment to be on
one of the panels, but offered a clue.&nbsp; &quot;The people
that have a vested interest in keeping the policy as it is today
are the ones to look at,&quot; says Contreras, who appeared as
scheduled at the debate. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Those vested interests include drug testing companies and
anti-drug consulting firms, the sprawling D.A.R.E. bureaucracy,
private prison operators, police departments dependent on asset
forfeitures and others with a financial stake in maintaining the
war on drugs at current levels.&nbsp; &quot;They don't want
changes,&quot; says Contreras. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">One name among the just-say-don't-say-anything forces did
repeatedly surface -- Calvina Fay, executive director of
Houston's Drug-Free Business Initiative, a nonprofit organization
working to eliminate drug and alcohol abuse in the
workplace.&nbsp; Fay phoned a number of the participants and
tried to persuade them not to attend the Robison-organized
functions.&nbsp; &quot;Ms. Fay was pretty upset,&quot; Castillo
says.&nbsp; &quot;She doesn't think the matter should even be
discussed.&nbsp; She said that Robison and all of them were
legalizers.&quot;</font></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="../images/robison.jpg" border="1"
        width="357" height="444"></td>
        <td valign="bottom"><font face="Arial"><strong>UT's Alan
        Robison: &quot;The war on drugs ... is a bad policy.</strong></font>&nbsp;
        <font face="Arial"><strong>It doesn't work.&quot;</strong></font></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><font size="4"><spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Calvina Fay appears suspicious, and her unease
is somehow compounded by her incongruous pre-Halloween
jack-o'-lantern earings, black widow hose and &quot;Cool
Ghoul&quot; pin.&nbsp; Before answering questions, she demands to
know if the reporter does in fact work for the <i>Press</i> or is
simply masquerading as a journalist on behalf of the enemy. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Fay organizes educational compaigns, speaks to employers, edits
HDFBI's newsletter and otherwise oversees the group's anti-drug
efforts.&nbsp; She joined the organization in 1990 after running
her own drug-testing company for several years.&nbsp; During that
time, she says, she experienced firsthand the horrors of
controlled substances. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Fay says HDFBI operates on a shoestring: Its office is donated,
its programs are subsidized and much of its labor is
volunteer.&nbsp; Despite several requests, however, she would not
allow the <i>Press</i> to see the organization's annual IRS Form
990s prior to our deadline -- a violation of federal law
governing disclosure for tax-exempt nonprofits.&nbsp; And while
she says no one's making money off of the HDFBI, one of the
group's charter sponsors is a drug-testing company, Drug Screens
Inc. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">To Fay, all efforts to moderate the nation's tough drug laws,
including such seemingly innocuous proposals as loosening
restrictions on industrial-grade hemp for cultivation, are part
of a widespread conspiracy to legalize drugs.&nbsp; &quot;It is
very organized,&quot; she says with a knowing smile.&nbsp;
&quot;It is very deliberate.&nbsp; It is very well funded,
too.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">As proof, Fay says she's compiled a library of videotapes of the
movement's leaders openly advocating the use and legalization of
drugs.&nbsp; She regularly monitors the Internet site of the
Washington, D.C.-based Drug Policy Foundation, whose work
parallels Robison's on a national scale, and has downloaded
numerous incriminating documents, including a marijuana smoking
instructional.&nbsp; &quot;They have totally polluted the
Internet,&quot; she says. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Asked about such reform-minded conservatives as William F.
Buckley and federal judge and former California prosecutor James
Gray, Far tars them with a big brush.&nbsp; &quot;Since Buckley
is a pot smoker, of course he'd like to see it legalized,&quot;
she says.&nbsp; As for Gray, &quot;I don't know who all he's tied
in with.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Locally, Fay points to links between the Drug Policy Forum of
Texas and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws.&nbsp; Ralph Hodges, a member of the Forum executive board,
is a former NORML officer and still active in the local
chapter.&nbsp; She's got something on Robison, too, but she won't
go into details.&nbsp; &quot;There is something specific about
him,&quot; she says.&nbsp; &quot;I don't want to be the one
telling you.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Fay readily admits asking people to reconsider participation in
Robison's debates.&nbsp; She herself was asked to sit on a panel
but declined because she felt the format -- 30 minutes for reform
advocate Kevin Zeese followed by five rebuttal minutes from six
different speakers -- was a setup.&nbsp; But she denies that she
pressured anyone to withdraw and says she only called to warn
panelists of the true nature of the sponsors.&nbsp; She phoned
former drug czar Lee Brown, for instance, to advise him on
handling tough questions.&nbsp; &quot;I wanted participants to
know who they were dealing with,&quot; she says.&nbsp; Besides,
Fay adds, some things just aren't worth talking about.&nbsp;
&quot;Legalization is not a debatable issue,&quot; she
says.&nbsp; &quot;It's like debating racism.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Calvina Fay says she's got science on her
side.&nbsp; Marijuana is addictive, causes schizophrenia and
other mental disorders and has absolutely no medical value, she
published in HDFBI's most recent newsletter.&nbsp; Asked the
source of the schizophrenia claim, Fay cited an inconclusive 1987
Swedish study published in the prestigious British medical
journal <i>Lancet</i>.&nbsp; But in an editorial last November
promoting a more rational approach, <i>Lancet</i> concluded that
&quot;cannabis per se is not a hazard to society, but driving it
further underground may be.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Fay also contends that needle exchange programs to reduce HIV
infection and promote treatment for intravenous drug abusers are
a failure.&nbsp; As proof, she cites statistics on a Canadian
experiment that she just accessed from the Internet.&nbsp; (She
promised to share those statistics, but didn't produce them
before our deadline.) On the other hand, the federal Centers for
Disease Control, in a 1993 report on the 33 needle exchange
programs in the United States, argued for expanded services and
research and recommended repeal of the ban on &quot;the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Short of conclusive evidence, Fay relies mostly on
anecdotes.&nbsp; She's heard enough D.A.R.E. graduates say
&quot;no&quot; to discredit any studies challenging the program's
effectiveness.&nbsp; And she personally traveled to Switzerland
and talked to a drug addict, returning with the depressing
knowledge that the country's heroin giveaway and needle exchange
experiments are a complete failure, even though the Swiss
government has expanded the program to a number of cities since
its inception. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Fay's tales aren't enough to sway those who spend their lives
studying chemical dependency and working in the field.&nbsp;
&quot;I think there is pretty much a consensus among the medical
and public health professional communities,&quot; says Thomas
Burks, executive vice president for research and academic affairs
at the UT Health Science Center.&nbsp; &quot;Our present national
drug policy is not effective.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">But consensus apparently doesn't mean the freedom to speak out,
and even the slightest deviation from the party line can be
politically fatal.&nbsp; Castillo may have been the only
scheduled debate participant to change his mind, but the heat has
been felt in other quarters.&nbsp; After initially agreeing to
host a meeting of health service providers and Kevin Zeese about
harm reduction strategies, Covenant House executive director
Phyllis Green had a change of heart when someone she won't name
described organizers as &quot;a legalization group.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Being painted as a public enemy has proved frustrating for
Robison, who says he'll continue his efforts to bring rational
debate to the highly charged issue.&nbsp; But it won't be easy,
as Barbara Weyland can verify.&nbsp; Weyland, who performs
HIV/AIDS prevention education for the nonprofit Montrose
Counseling Center and once worked for the city health department,
says she's often been stymied trying to discuss the idea of
needle exchange, let alone more sweeping reforms.&nbsp;
&quot;It's ridiculous to ask for political support for
this,&quot; she says.&nbsp; &quot;It's a political bullet in the
head.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;Nobody wants to talk about it,&quot; says Weyland.&nbsp;
&quot;They don't want to talk to each other about it.&nbsp; They
don't want to talk to you about it.&nbsp; They don't want to talk
about it at all.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>Truth-free?</strong></font><br>
<font size="4">After reading such a revealing article [Just Say
No (to Open Debate), by Bob Burtman, November 7], I promise to
check out your magazine on a weekly basis.&nbsp; Gentlemen, this
is superb investigative journalism, and Bob Burtman deserves
major commendation from the public at large for tackling this
red-hot-potato topic.&nbsp; I can only suggest that a series of
follow-up articles (partnership for our Truth-free America, DARE,
forfeiture, medical rights, etc.) would be the crowning
achievements to exposing those who are hell-bent on destroying
our great America under the premise of saving it.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Obviously, the status quo (Calvina Fay included) that has built
financially upon this Holy War on (some) drugs cannot tolerate
any challenge to the politically correct party line.&nbsp; Ms.
Fay, racism cannot exist if it is talked about.&nbsp; Your very
rationale to deny discussion allows it to continue.&nbsp; Denial
simply isn't a solution.&nbsp; It's like protecting a child
molester or pedophile simply by refusing to place them out in
public view.&nbsp; Truth-free or drug-free?&nbsp; Your abstinence
ideology simply is incompatible with our (supposedly) free
society.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Why the secrecy and suspiciousness Ms. Fay?&nbsp; When the police
would rather stop to kick your back door in under the premise of
acquiring your assets through forfeiture instead of chasing
violent crime (because it doesn't pay anything!), where is our
Constitution, much less your Bill of Rights!&nbsp; Where are our
priorities to society?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Obviously, the methods that the drug warriors are using simply
aren't working and never will.&nbsp; The vast majority of them
are honorable, but some are selling us all down the road to a
soon-to-be police state.&nbsp; Ms. Fay is one of those, because
she obviously doesn't appreciate our First Amendment or support
of opposing views.&nbsp; As Superior Judge James P. Gray stated
October 18 at the Drug Policy Forum of Texas's most recent forum,
it is possible to support drug legalization without
supporting/condoning drug use.&nbsp; This very idea terrifies and
frightens Ms. Fay and her kind to the very core of their
beliefs.&nbsp; They already know that they have a morally
indefensible position and that it does not hold up to careful
scrutiny.&nbsp; They refuse to debate because they already know
that they cannot win face to face.&nbsp; The truth has nothing to
fear!&nbsp; The very purpose of the Drug Policy Forum is to
promote discussion of these issues and pursue solutions from as
widely diverse a group that has very different political
philosophies but has found common ground on this particular issue
that affects us all.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25"><em>D. Jones</em><br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25"><em>via Internet</em></font></p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>Drug Preference</strong></font><br>
<font size="4">I'm writing to comment on Calvina Fay and her
puritanical views.&nbsp; She said that legalization &quot;is not
a debatable issue.&nbsp; It's like debating racism.&quot;&nbsp;
Sorry, Calvina, your analogy doesn't even make sense.&nbsp; How
does one compare a debate about legalizing a soft drug like
marijuana to racism?&nbsp; What's to debate about racism?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Keep in mind, Cal, that marijuana and other drugs that are now
illegal in the United States (though not in other countries that
have lower crime rates) were made illegal just about the time
that Prohibition ended.&nbsp; Sounds to me like our government
sanctioned alcohol as our national drug -- and made a lot of
white men rich by doing so.&nbsp; Native Americans and Negroes
were more familiar with the uses of marijuana at the time than
white folks, and many white men didn't even know what it
was.&nbsp; Sounds like racism to me -- if Calvina is into the
racism argument.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">I've never heard of people who smoke marijuana beating or killing
loved ones, causing vehicular manslaughter, getting into bar
fights, vomiting on themselves or others, or losing their
judgment and committing crimes.<br>
People who drink too much are not endearing -- they're rude,
inconsiderate and cause many problems to those around them.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Has Calvina ever had alcohol?&nbsp; Or caffeine?&nbsp; Used
tobacco in any form?&nbsp; Taken a painkiller for a
headache?&nbsp; All of these are considered drugs, too.<br>
Only when she is free of all of these drugs will I respect her
judgment on drugs she prefers not to use.<br>

<P>
All assessments of taxes made pursuant to this chapter shall be considered jeopardy assessments or collections as provided in section 422.30. The director shall assess a tax, interest, and applicable penalties based on knowledge or information available to the director; serve the taxpayer by regular mail at the taxpayer's last known address or in person, a written notice of the amount of tax, interest, and penalty due, which notice may include a demand for immediate payment; and immediately proceed to collect the tax, interest, and penalty by any method prescribed in section 422.30.

assessment is unlimited. Service of the notice by regular mail is complete upon mailing.
<P>
A person shall not bring suit to enjoin the assessment or collection of any taxes, interest, or penalties imposed by this chapter.
<P>
The tax, interest, and penalties assessed by the director are presumed to be valid and correctly determined and assessed. The burden is upon the taxpayer to show any incorrectness or invalidity of an assessment. The burden is upon the taxpayer to prove that the shipment, transportation, importation, acquisition, purchase, possession, manufacture, or production of a taxable substance was lawful if a taxpayer's status as a dealer is disputed. Any statement filed by the director with the clerk of the district court, or any other certificate by the director of the amount of tax, interest, and penalties determined or assessed is admissible in evidence and is prima facie evidence of the facts contained in the statement.
<HR>
<A NAME="10"><STRONG>453B.10 Confidential nature of information.</STRONG></A>
<P>
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the director or an employee of the department shall not reveal any information obtained from a dealer; nor shall information obtained from a dealer be used against the dealer in any criminal proceeding, unless the information is independently obtained, except in connection with a proceeding involving taxes due under this chapter from the dealer against whom the tax was assessed.
<P>
A person who violates this section is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
<P>
This section does not prohibit the director from publishing statistics that do not disclose the identity of the dealers.

<HR>
<A NAME="11"><STRONG>453B.11 Examination of records by director---subpoenas.</STRONG></A>
<P>
For the purpose of determining whether or not the dealer should have paid taxes, determining the amount of tax that should have been paid, or collecting any taxes under this chapter, the director may examine, or cause to be examined, any books, papers, records, or memoranda that may be relevant to making such determinations, whether the books, papers, records, or memoranda are the property of or in the possession of the dealer or another person. The director may require the attendance of any person having knowledge or information that may be relevant, compel the production
<P>
of books, papers, records, or memoranda by persons required to attend, take testimony on matters material to the determination, and administer oaths or affirmations. Upon demand of the director or an examiner or investigator, the court shall issue a subpoena for the attendance of a witness or the production of books, papers, records, or memoranda. The director may also issue subpoenas. Disobedience of subpoenas issued under this chapter is punishable by the district court of the county in which the subpoena is issued, or if the subpoena is issued by the director, by the district court of the county in which the party served with the subpoena is located, in
the same manner as a contempt of court.
<P>
The director may petition the district court or a magistrate for an
administrative search warrant as authorized by section 808.14 to execute a distress warrant authorized by section 422.26.
<HR>
<A NAME="12"><STRONG>453B.12 Civil and criminal penalties for violation of chapter---interest.</STRONG></A>
<P>
A dealer who violates this chapter is subject to a penalty equal to the amount of the tax imposed by section 453B.7, in addition to the tax imposed by that section. The dealer shall pay interest on the tax and penalty at the rate in effect under section 421.7, counting each fraction of a month as an entire month, computed from the date of assessment through the date of payment. The penalty and interest shall be collected as part of the tax.
<P>
In addition to the civil tax penalty and interest imposed by this section, a dealer distributing, offering to sell, or possessing taxable substances without affixing the appropriate stamps, labels, or other official indicia is guilty of a class "D" felony.
<P>
A person who possesses, prints, engraves, makes, issues, sells, or
circulates a counterfeit taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia, or places or causes to be placed a counterfeit taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia on a taxable substance, is guilty of a class "D" felony.
<P>
A person who uses, sells, offers for sale, or possesses for use or sale a previously used or expired taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia, or attaches or causes to be attached a previously used or expired taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia to a taxable substance, is guilty of a class "D" felony.
<P>
Notwithstanding section 802.3, an indictment may be found or information filed upon any criminal offense specified in this chapter, in the proper court, within six years after the commission of the offense.
<HR>
<A NAME="13"><STRONG>453B.13 Credit for previously paid taxes.</STRONG></A>
<P>
If another state or local unit of government has previously assessed an excise tax on a taxable substance, the taxpayer shall pay the difference between the tax imposed under this chapter and the tax previously paid. If the tax previously paid to the other state or local unit of government was equal to or greater than the tax imposed under this chapter, no tax is due. The burden is on the taxpayer to show that an excise tax on the taxable substances has been paid to another state or local unit of government.
<HR>

<P>
Sections 421.5, 422.26, 422.28, 422.29, 422.73, subsection 2, and 422.74 shall apply to this chapter, except that a refund claim filed later than thirty days from the expiration date of the stamps for which the refund is requested shall not be allowed by the director.
<HR>
<A NAME="15"><STRONG>453B.15 Availability of records and information.</STRONG></A>
<P>
The director may request from state, county, and local agencies,
information and assistance deemed necessary to administer this chapter.

<STRONG>RICHARD A. DRESSLER,</STRONG>

<STRONG>IOWA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION,
STATE OF IOWA,</STRONG>

     Appellee.


     Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Robert A. 

Hutchison, Judge.


     Appeal from district count denial of petition for a writ of 

certiorari challenging constitutionality of agency action under 

Iowa Code section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.2O9(8)</A> (1995).  <STRONG>REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH 

DIRECTIONS.</STRONG>


     William Jeffrey Crispin of Wilson & Adams, P.C., Des Moines, for 

appellant.


     Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, David A. Ferree, Special 

Assistant Attorney General, and Kerry Anderson, Assistant Attorney 

General, for appellee.


     Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Lavorato, Snell, and 

Andreasen, JJ.
<HR><CENTER>2</CENTER>
<STRONG>LAVORATO, Justice.</STRONG>

     Richard A. Dressler appeals from the district count's denial of 

his Petition for a writ of certiorari against the Iowa Department of 

Transportation (IDOT).  In his petition, Dressler challenges as 

unconstitutional 1993 Iowa Acts chapter 16, section 4, codified at 

Iowa Code section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> (1995).  Section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> authorizes 

the IDOT to revoke the driver's license of a person convicted of 

certain drug, drug tax, or drug-related offenses.

     We reach only DressIer's contention that section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> 

violates double jeopardy guarantees.  We conclude section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> 

is constitutionally infirm under the federal Double Jeopardy Clause.  

We reverse the district court's order denying Dressler's petition for 

a writ of certiorari.  We remand to allow the district court to enter 

an order granting the writ.

     <STRONG>I.</STRONG>  <EM>Background Facts and Proceedings.</EM>

     In March 1994 Dressler pleaded guilty to the possession of a 

controlled substance.  <EM>See</EM> Iowa Code  <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  About six weeks 

later, the IDOT notified Dressler in writing that his driving 

privileges were revoked for 180 days pursuant to Iowa Code section 

<A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A>.  The notice also informed Dressler that he was not 

entitled to a preliminary hearing on the matter.

     Dressler then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the 

district court.  In the petition he asked the court to find section 

321.209(8) unconstitutional on the three grounds he urges here.  

Dressler appeals from the court's order dismissing the writ.

     <STRONG>II.</STRONG>  <EM>Scope of Review.</EM>

     A writ of certiorari is proper under Iowa Rule of Civil 

Procedure 306 when one "exercising judicial functions . . . is 

alleged to have . . . acted illegally."  Our review of certiorari 

actions is generally at law.  <EM>Grant v. Iowa Dist. Ct.</EM>, 492 N.W.2d 

683, 685 (Iowa 1992).  Because Dressler alleges a constitutional
<HR><CENTER>3</CENTER>
violation, our review is de novo.  State v. Clarke, 475 N.W.2d 193, 
194 (Iowa 1991).

     <STRONG>III.</STRONG>  <EM>Applicable Law.</EM>

     Iowa Code section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> pertinently provides that 

          [t]he department shall upon twenty days' notice and 
     without preliminary hearing revoke the license or operating 
     privilege of an operator upon receiving a record of the 
     operator's conviction for any of the following offenses, 
     when such conviction has become final:
          [Sections 1-7 deal with vehicle-related offenses.]

          8.  A controlled substance offense under section 
     <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401</A>, 124.401A, 124.402 or 124.403; a controlled 
     substance tax offense under chapter <A HREF="453b.html">453B</A>; a drug or 
     drug-related offense under section 126.3; or an offense 
     under <A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/ch13.html">21 U.S.C. ch. 13</A>.

     <STRONG>IV.</STRONG>  <EM>Double Jeopardy.</EM>

     The Fifth Amendment to the federal constitution provides that no 

person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in 

jeopardy of life or limb."  U.S. Const. amend. V.  The protections 

against double jeopardy are enforceable against the states through 

the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal constitution.  <EM>Benton v. 

Maryland</EM>, 395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2062, 23 L.Ed.2d 707, 716 

(1969).

     The Double Jeopardy Clause is violated when (1) a second 

prosecution for the same offense occurs after acquittal, (2) a second 

prosecution for the same offense occurs after conviction, and (3) 

multiple punishments occur for the same offense.  <EM>North Carolina v. 

Pearce</EM>, 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L.Ed.2d 656, 664-

65 (1969); <EM>State v. Taft</EM>, 506 N.W.2d 757, 760 (Iowa 1993).

     Dressler's double jeopardy claim falls within the third 

situation: multiple punishments occurring for the same offense.  He 

contends the State impermissibly inflicted two punishments upon him 

for the same offense-possession of a controlled substance.  Dressler 

claims he was punished the first time when he was incarcerated and 

paid a $250 fine and count costs for possession under section
<HR><CENTER>4</CENTER>
<A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  He claims he was punished a second time when the IDOT 

notified him that, without the benefit of a hearing, his license was 

revoked for 180 days.

     Dressler says that to escape double jeopardy concerns, a state 

wishing to inflict postconviction punishment upon a defendant must do 

so in a single proceeding.  He contends that was not the case here, 

because the license revocation followed Dressler's initial conviction 

and sentence under section <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  This, he argues, constituted 

multiple prosecution and punishment for the same offense in separate 

proceedings,  constitutionally prohibited by federal double jeopardy 

guarantees.

     To support his argument, Dressler relies heavily on two recent 

United States Supreme Court decisions: <EM>United States v. Halper</EM>, 490 

U.S. 435, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 104 L.Ed.24 487 (1989), and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-144.ZO.filt"><EM>Montana 

Department of Revenue v. Kurth Ranch</EM></A>, 511 U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 1937, 

128 L.Ed.2d 767 (1994).  In <EM>Halper</EM>, the Court held that a civil 

penalty, imposed after a criminal penalty, may constitute a second 

punishment for double jeopardy purposes

     when the sanction as applied in the individual case serves 
     the goals of punishment.
          These goals are familiar.  We have recognized in 
     other contexts that punishment serves the twin aims of 
     retribution and deterrence.  Furthermore, "[r]etribution 
     and deterrence are not legitimate nonpunitive governmental 
     objectives."  From these premises, it follows that a civil 
     sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a 
     remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also 
     serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is 
     punishment, as we have come to understand the term.  We 
     therefore hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a 
     defendant who alreadv has been punished in a criminal 
     prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil 
     sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not 
     fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent 
     or retribution.

<EM>Halper</EM>, 490 U.S. at 448-49, 109 S.Ct. at 1901-02, 104 L.Ed.2d at 501-

02 (citations omitted).

     In <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-144.ZO.filt"><EM>Kurth Ranch</EM></A>, the Court had before it a postconviction drug 

tax assessment.  Employing a different analysis from that articulated 

in Halper, the
<HR><CENTER>5</CENTER>
Court held that the tax constituted a second punishment.  For that 

reason, the tax had to be imposed during the first prosecution or not 

at all.  The Court characterized the postconviction proceeding to 

collect a tax as "the functional equivalent of a successive criminal 

prosecution that placed the Kurths in jeopardy a second time 'for the 

same offence.'"  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-144.ZO.filt"><EM>Kurth Ranch</EM></A>, 511 U.S. at ___, 114 S.Ct. at 1948, 128 

L.Ed.2d at 782.  Simply put, as Dressler says, "a state wishing to 

inflict postconviction punishment on a defendant must do so in a 

single proceeding.  Otherwise, punishment following an initial 

conviction and sentencing is barred as double jeopardy."

     The question boils down to whether the license revocation is 

punitive or remedial.

     The State concedes Dressler was sanctioned in the criminal case 

<EM>before</EM> his license was revoked in a civil proceeding under section 

<A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A>.  But the State argues the subsequent revocation of 

Dressler's license is not subsequent punishment for possession of a 

controlled substance under section <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  The State strongly 

asserts that the underlying purpose of section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> is remedial 

rather than punitive, designed solely for the safety of the public.  

For that reason, the State concludes, no double jeopardy violation 

occurred.

     We think the question whether the revocation was punitive rather 

than remedial is controlled by our recent decision in <A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills v. Iowa 

Department of Transportation</EM></A>, 534 N.W.2d 640 (Iowa 1993).  In <A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills</EM></A>, 

the defendant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while 

intoxicated.  After a search incident to arrest, the defendant was 

also charged with possession of marijuana.  See Iowa Code  

<A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  Before the defendant's pretrial conference -- at which 

the defendant intended to plead guilty to the possession charge -- 

section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> became effective.  As a consequence, the IDOT 

revoked the defendant's license
<HR><CENTER>6</CENTER>
over her objection that to do so was an ex post facto application of 

section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A>.

     On judicial revIew of the IDOT's decision, the district court  

reversed.  On appeal the IDOT argued that ex post facto protections 

did not apply to a revocation based on a controlled substance 

violation, because the revocation was a civil, rather than criminal, 

penalty.  <EM>See State v. Taggart</EM>, 186 Iowa 247, 254, 172 N.W. 299, 301 

(1919) (ex post facto protections apply only to penal and criminal 

actions, not civil actions).  This is the same argument the State 

posits against Dressler's double jeopardy claim here.

     In rejecting this argument in <A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills</EM></A>, we said the answer turned 

on whether the legislative purpose underpinning the controlled 

substance revocation is promotion of highway safety.  In concluding 

there was no direct connection between possession of controlled 

substances, driving, and public safety, we said that

     [p]ersons who illegally possess drugs are of course subject 
     to appropriate criminal punishment.  But many such persons 
     choose not to drive.  When they do not, they do not affect 
     highway safety.  Any connection between drugs, driving, and 
     public safety is at most indirect.  <EM>The amended statute 
     authorizing this license revocation was aimed essentially at 
     enhancing punishmen for controllcd substance possession.</EM>

<A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills</EM></A>, 534 N.W.2d at 642 (emphasis added).

     Our conclusion in <A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills</EM></A> that section 321.209(8) enhances 

punishment of a controlled substance possession dispenses with the 

State's assertion that this section is not a penal statute.  Because 

section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> twice punishes Dressler for the same offense -- 

possession of a controlled substance -- in a separate proceeding, we 

conclude it unconstitutionally contravenes Dressler's double jeopardy 

guarantees.

     <STRONG>V.</STRONG>  <EM>Disposition.</EM>

     We conclude that section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> violates double jeopardy 

principles by twice punishing Dressler for possession of a controlled 

substance in separate
<HR><CENTER>7</CENTER>
proceedings.  We therefore reverse the district court's order denying 

Dressler's petition for a writ of certiorari.  We remand to allow the 

district court to enter an order granting the writ.

     <STRONG>REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS.</STRONG>

<TITLE>New Iowa Double Jeopardy Ruling</TITLE>
</HEAD>

The Des Moines Register, Wednesday, February 7, 1996, page 1M 
 
Court restores driving privileges 
 
The ruling says the state may not automatically suspend licenses of 
convicted drug dealers. 
 
By THOMAS A. FOGARTY 
Register Staff Writer 
 
     Hundreds of convicted drug dealers will have their driving 
privileges restored and the state of Iowa could lose more than $16 
million annually in federal highway aid as a result of a little-
noticed decision issued last month by the Iowa Supreme Court. 
     The court struck down a 1993 state law that calls for the 
automatic six-month suspension of the driver's license of anyone 
convicted of a drug-related criminal charge.  According to the court, 
the license suspension was an unconstitutional second punishment for 
a single criminal action. 
 
Subject to Suspension 
     Shirley Andre, chief of the Department of Transportation motor 
vehicle division, said 8,483 people with drug convictions were 
subject to the suspension law before the court nullified it with its 
decision Jan. 17. 
     With the decision, Andre said, the department stopped imposing 
new suspensions and lifted those that were in effect.  Although the 
department has yet to systematically contact those serving their 
suspension that driving privileges have been restored, officials have 
informed drug offenders who have inquired about their driving statis. 
     Transportation officials have decided against expunging drug-
related suspensions from the driving records of those who have 
already completed them, Andre said. 
     The Supreme Court ruled in a case brought by Richard Dressler of 
Des Moines, who in March 1994 was stopped by authorities near Huxley 
for a broken taillight.  Officers discovered a small quantity of 
marijuana in his possession.  Dressler pleaded guilty and paid the 
fine on the criminal charge. 
     He challenged the license suspension in court.  Ironically, 
disposition of the case took so long that Dressler served the full 
suspension, so the ruling has no practical effect on him. 
     "It's the first step in the right direction of common sense," 
said Jeff Crispin, the Des Moines lawyer who represented Dressler.  
"There's no logical connection between these drug offenses and 
driving privileges." 
 
Unrelated Charges 
     The court decision addresses only license suspension for drug 
offenses that are unrelated to driving, such as possession or sale of 
drugs.  It has no bearing on license suspensions for those convicted 
of driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.  In fact, 
the Iowa Supreme Court issued an opinion on the same day last month 
upholding precedures for suspending the licenses of drivers charged 
with driving under the influence. 
     Three years ago, Gov. Terry Branstad recommended to the 
Legislature passage of license suspensions in drug cases.  Branstad's 
support of such a policy as a get-tough measure only partially 
explains how the law came to be. 
     In addition, the federal government said failure by Iowa or any 
other state to pass such a measure would cost state governments 5 
percent of their federal highway aid in 1994, and 10 percent in 
subsequent years.  At the time, transportion department lobbyists 
told lawmakers that the higher percentage represented about $16 
million a year for Iowa.  The sum presumably would be higher now, 
Andre said. 
     The federal deadline for state action on the legislation has 
passed, so the Supreme Court's decision to nullify the Iowa law 
leaves the status of future federal highway aid questionable.  Andre 
said officials are preparing a letter to U.S. Transportation 
Secretary Federico Pena explaining the situation and seeking his 
guidance. 
     "To my knowledge, no other state has been fraced with this 
particular challenge," said Andre. 
     In addition to sorting things out with federal highway 
officials, Andre said her agency has been discussing with Branstad 
staff possible legislative responses to the court's decision. 
     Andre and David Hudson, Branstad's legislative lobbyist, say 
it's too early to know what course of action will be recommended this 
session to the Legislature.  The options include repealing the 
unconstitutional provision outright, or developing a substitute 
provision that would achieve the same goals in a constitutional way. 
     In 1993, the federal government permitted states that opposed 
the license suspension policy for drug offenders to preserve their 
full highway allotment by passing a legislative resolution stating 
their intention not to pass such a law.  Even if that option remains 
for Iowa officials - and it's not clear that it does - Andre said 
it's an unlikely course of action, given Branstad's support for the 
suspension policy.

  1  1    Section 1.  Section <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/401.html#3">124.401</A>, subsection 3, Code 1995, is
  1  2 amended to read as follows:
  1  3    3.  <STRONG>a.</STRONG>  It is unlawful for any person knowingly or
  1  4 intentionally to possess a controlled substance unless such
  1  5 substance was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid
  1  6 prescription or order of a practitioner while acting in the
  1  7 course of the practitioner's professional practice, or except
  1  8 as otherwise authorized by this chapter.  Any person who
  1  9 violates this subsection is guilty of <EM>a serious</EM> <STRONG>an aggravated</STRONG>
  1 10 misdemeanor <STRONG>for the first offense, and a class "D" felony for</STRONG>
  1 11 <STRONG>the second and each subsequent offense if the second or</STRONG>
  1 12 <STRONG>subsequent offense occurs within six years of the previous</STRONG>
  1 13 <STRONG>offense</STRONG>.  <EM>If the controlled substance is marijuana, the</EM>
  1 14 <EM>punishment shall be by imprisonment in the county jail for not</EM>
  1 15 <EM>more than six months or by a fine of not more than one</EM>
  1 16 <EM>thousand dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment.  All</EM>
  1 17 <EM>or any part of a sentence imposed pursuant to this section may</EM>
  1 18 <EM>be suspended and the person placed upon probation upon such</EM>
  1 19 <EM>terms and conditions as the court may impose including the</EM>
  1 20 <EM>active participation by such person in a drug treatment,</EM>
  1 21 <EM>rehabilitation or education program approved by the court.</EM>
  1 22    <STRONG>b.  Any person who possesses marijuana is guilty of a</STRONG>
  1 23 <STRONG>serious misdemeanor for the first offense, and is guilty of an</STRONG>
  1 24 <STRONG>aggravated misdemeanor for the second and each subsequent</STRONG>
  1 25 <STRONG>offense if the second or subsequent offense occurs within six</STRONG>
  1 26 <STRONG>years of the previous offense.</STRONG>
  1 27    <STRONG>c.  A person eighteen or older is guilty of an aggravated</STRONG>
  1 28 <STRONG>misdemeanor if the person knowingly or intentionally possesses</STRONG>
  1 29 <STRONG>any controlled substance in violation of this section in the</STRONG>
  1 30 <STRONG>presence of a minor.</STRONG>
  1 31    Sec. 2.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act shall not take effect
  1 32 unless an appropriation is enacted or the state's share of the
  1 33 cost is specified in accordance with section 25B.2, subsection
  1 34 3.  
  1 35                           EXPLANATION
  2  1    This bill provides that a person who unlawfully possesses a
  2  2 controlled substance other than marijuana commits an
  2  3 aggravated misdemeanor for the first offense and a class "D"
  2  4 felony for each subsequent offense if the subsequent offense
  2  5 is committed within six years of the previous offense.  The
  2  6 bill eliminates the six-month jail term and $1,000 fine for
  2  7 possession of marijuana and makes possession of marijuana a
  2  8 serious misdemeanor for the first offense and an aggravated
  2  9 misdemeanor for each subsequent offense if the subsequent
  2 10 offense is committed within six years of the previous offense.
  2 11 The bill also makes it an aggravated misdemeanor for an adult
  2 12 to unlawfully possess a controlled substance in the presence
  2 13 of a minor.
  2 14    The bill may contain a state mandate under chapter 25B and
  2 15 will not take effect unless an appropriation fully funding the
  2 16 cost to political subdivisions of complying with the bill or
  2 17 specifying the state's share of the cost of complying with the
  2 18 bill is enacted.

  1 21 However, the state may appeal the discretionary decision on
  1 22 the grounds that the stated mitigating circumstances do not
  1 23 warrant a reduction of the sentence.

  3  5 Computation of good conduct time is subject to the following
  3  6 conditions:
  3  7    Sec. 6.  APPLICABILITY OF WAIVER TO CURRENT INMATES.  The
  3  8 board of parole shall identify inmates currently serving
  3  9 mandatory minimum sentences for an offense under section 1 of
  3 10 this Act that would have been eligible for waiver of the
  3 11 mandatory minimum term if the inmates had been sentenced on or
  3 12 after the effective date of this Act.  For each inmate
  3 13 identified, the board of parole shall review the inmate's
  3 14 record and the circumstances surrounding the inmate's
  3 15 conviction and make a determination as to whether the inmate's
  3 16 mandatory minimum term should be waived.  If the parole board
  3 17 determines that the inmate's mandatory minimum term of
  3 18 confinement should be waived, the inmate shall be immediately
  3 19 eligible for parole.
  3 20    Sec. 7.  INTERIM STUDY COMMITTEE.  The legislative council
  3 21 is requested to establish an interim committee to study
  3 22 currently available sentencing and incarceration options.  The
  3 23 study may include but shall not be limited to a review of
  3 24 available jail, community corrections, and prison beds; the
  3 25 potential impact of the use of split sentencing on jail,
  3 26 community corrections, and prison bed space; security needs
  3 27 and costs associated with the implementation of hard labor
  3 28 requirements for persons incarcerated in corrections
  3 29 institutions; and the nature and costs associated with other
  3 30 sentencing options.  In addition to legislative members, the
  3 31 membership of the interim committee shall include the
  3 32 following public members:
  3 33    1.  A representative from the board of parole.
  3 34    2.  A representative from the division of criminal and
  3 35 juvenile justice planning of the department of human rights.
  4  1    3.  A representative from an association of sheriffs and
  4  2 deputy sheriffs.
  4  3    4.  A representative from the department of corrections.
  4  4    5.  A representative from a county board of supervisors.
  4  5    The committee shall submit findings and any recommendations
  4  6 in a report to the general assembly by January 1, 1997.
  4  7    Sec. 8.  RISK ASSESSMENT STUDY.  The department of
  4  8 corrections, in consultation with the board of parole and the
  4  9 division of criminal and juvenile justice planning of the
  4 10 department of human rights, shall conduct a study of the
  4 11 various risk assessment tools currently used in the Iowa
  4 12 corrections system to determine the relative risk posed by a
  4 13 criminal offender and the prospects for the offender's
  4 14 rehabilitation, and make findings and recommendations
  4 15 regarding the implementation and use of a risk assessment tool
  4 16 during or as part of the presentence investigation process.
  4 17 In conducting the study, the department shall also consult
  4 18 with faculty members with expertise in risk assessment who are
  4 19 from Iowa institutions of higher education which offer degree
  4 20 programs in criminology.  The recommendations and any
  4 21 corresponding findings shall be submitted in a report to the
  4 22 general assembly by January 1, 1997.
  4 23    Sec. 9.  SPLIT-SENTENCING PILOT PROJECT.
  4 24    1.  The general assembly finds that the implementation of a
  4 25 split-sentencing pilot project within this state could serve
  4 26 as a test for a fair and flexible method of dispensing
  4 27 criminal justice which provides for an incremental approach to
  4 28 the imposition of aggravated misdemeanor and felony criminal
  4 29 sentences and may help to reduce the current prison
  4 30 overcrowding problems while protecting the public safety.  A
  4 31 split-sentencing pilot project is therefore established in a
  4 32 judicial district to be determined by the supreme court.  The
  4 33 judicial district shall be selected based on the availability
  4 34 of jail space within the judicial district, and whether the
  4 35 judicial district in consultation with the county board or
  5  1 boards of supervisors and the sheriff or sheriffs desires to
  5  2 participate in the project.  Notwithstanding any other
  5  3 contrary provision of law, subsection 2 of this section shall
  5  4 apply within and only within the judicial district which is
  5  5 selected to participate in this pilot project from the date of
  5  6 the enactment of this Act through June 30, 1997.
  5  7    2.  By record entry at the time of or after sentencing for
  5  8 an aggravated misdemeanor or a felony, other than a class "A"
  5  9 felony, the court may sentence the defendant to serve up to
  5 10 ninety days of the sentence in the county jail and suspend the
  5 11 balance of the term imposed.  If the person is ordered to
  5 12 serve up to ninety days in jail, the costs of the person's
  5 13 confinement shall be paid by the state at the rate negotiated
  5 14 by the department of corrections with the judicial district
  5 15 under section 904.908.  Payment shall be made by the
  5 16 department of revenue and finance upon submission of a voucher
  5 17 executed by the sheriff.  Persons serving time in a county
  5 18 jail under this subsection shall be committed to the custody
  5 19 of the director of the department of corrections and the
  5 20 department shall be responsible for all prisoner medical
  5 21 costs.  
  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23    This bill provides that the court, when sentencing a person
  5 24 for certain drug offenses not involving a firearm or an
  5 25 assault, may waive an applicable mandatory minimum sentence if
  5 26 mitigating circumstances exist and are on record.  The waiver
  5 27 is appealable by the state.  The waiver may also be made
  5 28 retroactively applicable at the discretion of the parole
  5 29 board.
  5 30    The bill also provides that persons sentenced for a second
  5 31 forcible felony are to serve 85 percent of their sentence
  5 32 before they are eligible for parole or work release.  Persons
  5 33 sentenced for a third or subsequent forcible felony, under the
  5 34 bill, are to serve their entire sentence but are eligible for
  5 35 sentence reductions of up to 12 days per year for good
  6  1 behavior.  Persons confined in an institution under the
  6  2 control of the department of corrections are currently
  6  3 eligible for reductions of one day for each day of good
  6  4 behavior and an additional five days a month for participation
  6  5 in institutional employment, an employment program, or an
  6  6 educational or treatment program.
  6  7    The bill establishes a split-sentencing pilot project under
  6  8 which a court in the judicial district selected for the pilot
  6  9 project would be permitted to sentence a person convicted of a
  6 10 crime which is classified as an aggravated misdemeanor through
  6 11 a class "B" felony to up to 90 days in a county jail as part
  6 12 of the person's sentence and suspend the remaining term of
  6 13 confinement.  If a person is serving a sentence of confinement
  6 14 in a county jail, the person is committed to the custody of
  6 15 the director of the department of corrections and the costs of
  6 16 confinement in the jail and medical care will be paid by the
  6 17 state.
  6 18    The bill requests that the legislative council establish an
  6 19 interim committee to study currently available sentencing and
  6 20 incarceration options.  The committee is to include
  6 21 representatives of the board of parole, the division of
  6 22 criminal and juvenile justice planning, the sheriffs
  6 23 association, county boards of supervisors, and the department
  6 24 of corrections.
  6 25    The bill also directs the department of corrections to
  6 26 study the risk assessment tools currently used by the Iowa
  6 27 corrections system.  The department is to consult with persons
  6 28 with expertise in criminology, the division of criminal and
  6 29 juvenile justice planning, and the board of parole.

PAG LIN
  1  1 A Joint Resolution supporting the use of marijuana for medical 
  1  2    purposes in the state of Iowa. 
  1  3    WHEREAS, significant scientific and medical studies have 
  1  4 demonstrated that marijuana is safe for use under medical 
  1  5 supervision and that the cannabis plant, in its natural form, has 
  1  6 important therapeutic benefits that are often of critical medical 
  1  7 importance to persons afflicted with a variety of life- 
  1  8 threatening and sense-threatening illnesses; and 
  1  9    WHEREAS, courts have recognized marijuana's medical value in 
  1 10 treatment and have ruled that marijuana can be a drug of 
  1 11 "necessity" in the treatment of glaucoma, cancer, AIDS, and 
  1 12 multiple sclerosis; and 
  1 13    WHEREAS, the people of the state of Iowa believe that well- 
  1 l4 trained medical professionals rather than remote federal 
  1 15 bureaucrats should be responsible for determining a patient's 
  1 16 medical care routine; and 
  1 17    WHEREAS, seriously ill Iowans and other Americans are 
  1 18 unnecessarily suffering because of federal policies which legally 
  1 19 prohibit marijuana's legitimate medical use; and 
  1 20    WHEREAS, Iowa Code section <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/206.html">124.206</A>, subsection 7, paragraph 
  1 21 "a", enacted in 1979, allows the use of marijuana for medical 
  1 22 purposes in the state of Iowa, expressing the intent of the Iowa 
  1 23 General Assembly that marijuana should be available for 
  1 24 legitimate medical purposes; and 
  2  1    WHEREAS, these problems are not particular to the state of 
  2  2 Iowa, but generally affect the citizens of all states adversely; 
  2  3 NOW THEREFORE, 
  2  4 BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: 
  3  1    That the Iowa General Assembly memorializes the President
  3  2 and the United States Congress to end federal prohibitions
  3  3 against marijuana's legitimate medical use by creating a
  3  4 rational system of prescriptive medical access to marijuana;
  3  5 and
  3  6    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That copies of this Resolution be
  3  7 transmitted to the Honorable Bill Clinton, President of the
  3  8 United States; the Honorable Albert Gore, Vice President of
  3  9 the United States and President of the United States Senate;
  3 10 the Honorable Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the United States
  3 11 House of Representatives; the Honorable Robert Dole, Majority
  3 12 Leader of the United States Senate; Donna Shalala, Secretary
  3 13 of the United States Department of Health and Human Services;
  3 14 Janet Reno, United States Attorney General; and the members of
  3 15 Iowa's congressional delegation.  
  3 16                           EXPLANATION
  3 17    This resolution recites the Iowa general assembly's support
  3 18 for the removal of federal prohibitions relating to the
  3 19 legalization of marijuana for certain medical purposes in the
  3 20 state of Iowa.

Cannabis Research and International Law, A Thesis.

by Jon Gettman

(This article was written to clarify some ideas expressed in earlier
correspondence with Mario Lap.)

Summary:  International treaties requiring cannabis prohibition are based
on outdated scientific findings which lack modern day validity.  An effort
is underway in the U.S. to utilize legal and administrative procedures to
bring about an official review of this issue.  Advocates of ending cannabis
prohibition world-wide are invited to consider ways in which the research
behind this effort may aid efforts by other countries to call for a review
of the relevant international treaties.

        This article contains speculation about the impact of recent
cannabis-related research on international treaties.  This article presents
a thesis, and in no way attempts to present these assertions as
research-based analysis.  In fact I am presenting this speculation to
interested parties in hope that other people may be able to compile the
relevant research to transform this speculation into a well-founded
argument grounded in specific attributes of international law and treaty.

        The truth is, I don't know much about the international treaties
that concern cannabis control and prohibition.  I know a lot about United
States law, policy, and regulation, and what I know about the treaties
derives from that specific context.

        The way U.S. law is constructed, specific scientific findings are
required to classify a drug as prohibited.

        Until 1989 - 1994 no one knew what the mechanism of action was that
produced the characteristic effects of cannabis.  It has been assumed
throughout the 20th Century that cannabis affected the human brain in a
manner somehow similar to opium and opiate derivatives, and in both
domestic U.S. law and in International treaties this assumption has been
the basis for similar controls on both cannabinoids and opiates.  In the
U.S. this is manifest in the schedule I status of both cannabis and heroin.

        Until this period, henceforth described as circa 1991, all law and
policy about cannabis was based on a bet, on a wager that whenever science
figured out how it worked, it would prove cannabis worked like heroin.
Circa 1991 the discoveries, in fact, occurred, and it is now clear that
they bet on the wrong theory.  They bet on the wrong horse, and now they
don't want to talk about it and hope that nobody finds out.  They?
Politicians, government officials, and legislators in democratic societies
around the world who claim that prohibition is based on scientific
findings, not some form of repressive malice.

        Obligations affecting the prohibition and regulation of
cannabinoids related to two international treaties are codified in the U.S.
Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC Chapter 13.  These treaties are:  the
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 and Convention on Psychotropic
Substances, 1971.

        The mechanism of action by which cannabinoids affect the human
brain were discovered circa 1991.  This mechanism of action categorically
and definitively distinguishes cannabis from opiates, cocaine, and
amphetamines.  The latter list of drugs affects the neurotransmitter
dopamine, and cannabinoids to not.  See the following:

        1)  Cannabis produces effects by way of a receptor system .
Howlett, A.  "Pharmacology of Cannabinoid Receptors"  The Annual Review of
Pharmacology and Toxicology, 1995. (In press when copy received from
author.)

        2)  The receptor system allows a characterization of the dependence
liability of cannabis, and explains the fallacies of prior research
hypotheses.  Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in
Brain:  Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"  P.W. Kalivas and
H.H.Samson (eds.), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol Addiction, Annals
of the American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992.

        (Incidentally, this characterization proves that patients who use
marijuana therapeutically are not engaging in denial when they attest to
medical benefits, and therefore patient anecdotes have increased scientific
validity.)

        3)  The receptor system also allows for explanation of tolerance to
cannabis, and provides evidence that tolerance and dependence to cannabis
are mediated differently in the brain. Oviedo, A., Glowa, J, and Herkenham,
M. (1993), "Chronic cannabinoid administration alters cannabinoid receptor
binding in rat brain: a quantitative autoradiographic study." Brain
Research, 616:293-302. 1993.

        My thesis, then, is fairly straightforward.  How can treaties
regulating cannabis that were signed in 1961 and 1971 be based on any valid
scientific findings when the mechanism of action for cannabinoids wasn't
discovered until circa 1991?

        U.S. law contains the following provision:

        "Nothing in the amendments made by the Psychotropic Substances Act
of 1978 or the regulations or orders promulgated thereunder shall be
construed to preclude requests by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services or the Attorney General through the Secretary of State, pursuant
to article 2 or other applicable provisions of the Convention, for review
of scheduling decisions under such Convention, based on new or additional
information."  21 USC 811 (d)(5)

        This provision refers to the U.S. legislation that was passed to
bring the U.S. into compliance with the 1971 treaty.  However this
underscores a fundamental aspect of the relationship between U.S. law and
our international treaty obligations.  If there is a conflict between the
two, U.S. law takes precedence and our government must take steps to change
the treaty, whether it is the Single Convention or the Psychotropic treaty.

        There have been two significant legal actions to reschedule
cannabis in the United States, by NORML, and by Carl Olsen.  I have
initiated a third.  The process itself is relatively straightforward.  A
petition citing evidence is filed.  If the evidence provides sufficient
legal and/or scientific grounds for consideration, then the Drug
Enforcement Administration must defer the petition to the Department of
Health and Human Services for a scientific and medical evaluation.  The
findings of this evaluation are binding on DEA, which is not allowed to
make such scientific and medical judgments in the absence of HHS findings.
The scientific findings provided by HHS are then used to apply statute to
obtain the appropriate level of regulation and control.  (The failure of
HHS to provide any findings on marijuana's accepted medical use in the
United States was in part DEA's justification for refusing action on
NORML's petition.)

        In legal papers filed in 1982 the DEA acknowledged that this review
process by HHS could produce evidence which would require the U.S.
government to seek a change in the international scheduling of cannabis.

        A 1977 ruling in NORML v. DEA by the U.S. Court of Appeals
determined that because of international treaty obligations, cannabis must
be placed in either schedule I or II of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.
However U.S., courts have not ruled on the validity of the treaties in a
case where new evidence is submitted demonstrating the treaties are based
on invalid scientific assertions.

        The petition I filed in July, 1995 seeks the removal of all
cannabinoids from schedules I and II of the CSA because they do not possess
the high potential for abuse required for placement in those schedules
under U.S. law (see 21 USC 811(c) and 21 USC 812(b)(1)).  The petition
seeks only seeks the removal of cannabinoids from those two schedules, and
requests that the government appropriately schedule cannabinoids based on
the medical and scientific findings of the Department of Health and Human
Services.  In the U.S., this entire process is subject to review by both an
independent administrative law judge and the appeals branch of the
judiciary.

        The petition was accepted for filing by the Drug Enforcement
Administration on July 27, 1995.  Because the petition raises an issue
already decided by a U.S. court, it could (as Carl Olsen earlier and
shrewdly observed) easily have been dismissed under the doctrine of res
judicata, meaning (but not correctly translated) this was already decided.
However the petition raises a new issue, which is what happens if the
treaties are not based on valid science?

        Ending prohibition, in a technical sense, has always been
complicated by the treaties.  The U.S. government argues that the treaties
prevent them from ending prohibition.  And with apologies for the blatant
arrogance of this next remark, the whole world knows that the treaties will
not be changed unless the U.S. government agrees.

        In this specific case, it will be difficult for the U.S. Government
to ignore the scientific validity of the cannabinoid receptor research. The
petition for repeal is based on evidence from over 150 scientific journal
articles and government reports.  However the three articles cited above
are not only representative, but are in fact written by scientists with
reputations of the absolute highest caliber.  Dr. Miles Herkenham, key
author of two of the three studies cited above, is the chief of the
neuroanatomy section of the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH).

        It is my argument within the United States that in light of these
revolutionary research findings we have obligations under both U.S. and
international law to reassess the domestic and international legal status
of cannabis.

        My thesis is based on components of U.S. law, and this is all I
require for legal action within the United States.  It is my intention to
get the US to address the issue of international scheduling in light of the
recent scientific advances.  Perhaps the scientific findings supporting the
petition for repeal can support efforts by citizens of other countries to
have their governments seek the appropriate changes to international
treaties on cannabis.

        International treaties regarding cannabis prohibition are based on
invalid scientific findings that have been completely rejected by modern
day science.  How can any sovereign, democratic country justify adherence
to treaty provisions based on science which is so out of date?  Certainly,
these treaties provisions must be changed.

        How individuals around the world can bring this issue to the
attention of their governments is a question that deserves, I suggest, wide
consideration.

The Scientific And Legal Basis
for the End of Marijuana Prohibition

by Jon Gettman

        The Controlled Substances Act mandates that schedule I drugs have a
"high potential for abuse."  A judicious reading of both the statute and
the legislative history finds that this abuse potential is the key
criterion for its scheduling under the CSA.(NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735
(1977))(21 USC  812 (b)(1))  However, it has long been recognized that
marijuana does not satisfy this essential criterion.  Therefore the
justification for marijuana's continued placement in schedule I is a
presumption rather than a finding.(See U.S. Cong. and Admin. News 1970 p.
4578, p. 4579, p. 4629. See also 51 FR 22947 (1986))

        As of April, 1995, the Drug Enforcement Administration was "unaware
of any new scientific studies of marijuana that would lead [them] to
re-evaluate its classification at this time."  According to a letter from
Thomas Constantine, Administrator of DEA, if this author "has access to
scientific data concerning marijuana which he wishes to bring to our
attention, we will be pleased to consider it, should he care to share the
documentation with us."  Extensive documentation was provided to
Constantine on July 10, 1995 as part of an administrative petition
subjecting DEA's consideration of these issues to judicial review.

        The CSA establishes an eight item list of scientific and medical
factors that are to be considered in scheduling decisions. (21 USC 822 (c))
These factors are defined further in the legislative history.(see U.S.
Cong. and Admin. News 1970 p 4601 - 4603)

        The first factor is the drug's relative or actual potential for
abuse.  The contemporary paradigm for evaluating the abuse potential of a
drug has been developed by the Committee on the Problems of Drug
Dependence.[<a href="#7">7</a>]  They have concluded that self-administration in animal
studies is the necessary characteristic of a drug with a significant,
severe potential for abuse.[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#21">21</a>, <a href="#32">32</a>]  However, animals will not self
administer marijuana.[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>, <a href="#32">32</a>]

        The second factor is evidence of the drug's pharmacological
effects.  In 1989 Leo Hollister remarked that: "Our studies of cannabinoids
over the past 22 years have touched upon virtually every aspect of their
actions.  They constitute the largest series of studies of the human
pharmacology of marijuana on record."[<a href="#15">15</a>]  Since then further research by
the likes of Donald Tashkin, Mario Perez-Reyes, Julian Azorlosa, for
example, have supplemented the classic work on the chemistry and
pharmacology of marijuana by Agurell, Dewey, Hollister, Martin, Mechoulam,
and Razdan.

        The third factor considered in scheduling decisions is scientific
knowledge about the substance.  In 1988, it became obvious that scientists
had been wrong in their theories about how marijuana acted on the
brain.[<a href="#17">17</a>, <a href="#18">18</a>, <a href="#27">27</a>]  Recent Evidence affirms that marijuana activates a
unique receptor system in the brain.[<a href="#16">16</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>, <a href="#18">18</a>, <a href="#31">31</a>]  In another
current finding, it has been discovered that tolerance to marijuana is the
result of receptor down-regulation, rather than receptor desensitization as
was previously believed.[<a href="#25">25</a>, <a href="#29">29</a>]  In addition, the theory that marijuana's
lipophilic qualities produce a harmful effect has also been
contradicted.[<a href="#22">22</a>, <a href="#30">30</a>]  The receptor has been cloned[<a href="#23">23</a>], an endogenous
ligand for the cannabinoid receptor has been discovered[<a href="#9">9</a>], and an orally
effective cannabinoid antagonist has been created.[<a href="#28">28</a>]

        The fourth factor is the history and current pattern of abuse,
including "social, economic, and ecological characteristics of the segments
of the population involved in such abuse."  Critical evaluations of the
National Household Survey, the Monitoring the Future Project, the Drug
Abuse Warning Network and other federally sponsored reports provide more
than adequate data to evaluate this factor.  Key observations are that
marijuana use and adolescent access persist despite increased enforcement.
Moreover, the National Household Survey indicates that risk perception
associated with marijuana use decreases as education and age increase.[<a href="#34">34</a>]

        The most interesting factor for advocates of harm reduction
policies, though, is the fifth factor: scope duration and significance of
abuse.  According to the legislative history, "in reaching [her] decision,
the Attorney General should consider the economics of regulation and
enforcement attendant to [a scheduling decision].  In addition, [she]
should be aware of the social significance and impact of such a decision
upon those people, especially the young, that would be affected by it."

        This fifth factor allows the introduction of several critical
issues, such as the impact of schedule I status and enforcement policies
have on the private therapeutic use of marijuana[<a href="#12">12</a>] as well as their
effects on the cultivation of marijuana for medicinal or personal use[<a href="#11">11</a>].
This factor also allows the introduction of cost/benefit analyses of
decriminalization laws in various states[<a href="#2">2</a>], as well as the evaluations of
various state legislatures on the significance of marijuana abuse as it is
reflected in the scheduling of the substance under state law.[<a href="#24">24</a>]

        The sixth factor concerns the risk, if any, to public health.  "If
a drug creates no danger to the public health, it would be inappropriate to
control the drug under this bill." A recent editorial in favor of harm
reduction policies in the American Journal of Public Health calls for
development of "a new system that is consistent with present scientific
knowledge and able to incorporate new scientific findings."[<a href="#8">8</a>]  The
Controlled Substances Act provides such a system, and reformers should try
and make the CSA work the way it was intended to before contemplating a new
system.  This factor alone allows for the introduction of harm reduction
policies into scheduling and national drug policy.

        The reputed threat to public health presented by marijuana is a
result of the drug's perceive relation to the use of other dangerous drugs.
The contemporary gateway theory, though, acknowledges that alcohol and
cigarette use precede marijuana use, and that marijuana use does not
predict in any way use of more serious drugs.[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#20">20</a>, <a href="#33">33</a>, <a href="#35">35</a>, <a href="#36">36</a>]
Consequently, the policy ramification of the gateway theory is that the
public health would benefit from successful policies that delay the age of
first use of any drugs.[<a href="#20">20</a>]  Why is marijuana singled out?

        Norman Zinberg clarified the relationship of drug, set, and setting
to the understanding and treatment of drug use and abuse in 1984.[<a href="#37">37</a>]  An
emerging public health model that advocates harm reduction, the study of
use and abuse, and performance evaluation is evidence of gaining
recognition for the utility of Zinberg's ideas.[<a href="#13">13</a>, <a href="#34">34</a>]  A meta-analysis of
correlations between school-aged use of alcohol, marijuana and tobacco
conducted by the Bowman Gray School of Medicine concluded that the primary
correlates of school aged drug use were prior use and access.[<a href="#13">13</a>]

        There is considerable social science data and theory to support the
rescheduling of marijuana under these last two factors representing the
epidemiology and the significance of a drug's actual use in the population.

        The animal models used to determine the abuse potential of a drug
represent synergy between pharmacology and root behavioralism.[<a href="#4">4</a>]  Despite
their excellent predictive validity, they do not present a biological
marker.  This lack of a biological clarification of marijuana's abuse
potential has been the excuse to keep marijuana in schedule I.  The
discovery of the cannabinoid receptor system annihilates that excuse.

        The seventh factor is the substances physic or physical dependence
liability.  It has been long recognized that marijuana is not physically
addictive.[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#14">14</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>]

        Advances in neurobiology have provided a biological model for
explaining substance abuse.[<a href="#19">19</a>, <a href="#21">21</a>, <a href="#33">33</a>]  Drugs of abuse affect the
production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with response and
reward and now held to explain the compulsive self-administration of
drugs.[<a href="#10">10</a>, <a href="#19">19</a>, <a href="#21">21</a>, <a href="#33">33</a>]

        However, cannabinoid receptors are not located on dopamine
producing neurons.[<a href="#17">17</a>]  In vivo microdialysis has shown that unlike other
drugs[<a href="#10">10</a>] THC, the active chemical in marijuana, does not affect striatal
dopamine levels.[<a href="#5">5</a>5]  (Earlier research that had indicated a cannabinoid
effect on dopamine was found to be strain-specific, and has not been
replicated in other animal studies.[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>, <a href="#33">33</a>])

        Heroin (schedule I), cocaine (schedule II) and amphetamines
(schedule III) all affect dopamine production.  Marijuana, cannabinoids,
and THC do not.  Where shall we schedule marijuana under existing
provisions of controlled substances act?

        The eighth factor concerns the relation of the substance to other
scheduled chemicals.  The discovery of the receptor system provides the
scientific basis for considering cannabinoids as a family with a similar
mechanism of action.  This is especially accurate with regards to the
drug's dependence potential.  Scientists have long accepted the validity of
assertions about marijuana based on research on its constituent parts, such
as THC, cannabinol, marijuana smoke, and experimental cannabinoids.

        There is no basis for distinguishing between the marijuana and THC
in a consideration of dependence potential.

        As a result of this and other information, I believe that
marijuana, cannabinoids, and THC should be removed from schedules I and II,
and I have begun the administrative proceedings to consider this issue.

        By law, petitions for rulemaking changes are sent to the DEA.(21
CFR 1308.44)  The DEA then forwards the petition to the Department of 
Health and Human Services for a scientific and medical evaluation that is 
binding on DEA in regards to scheduling decisions.(21 USC  811 (b))  The 
Court of Appeals has ruled that petitions must be judged on merit.(NORML v. 
DEA, 559 F.2d 735 (1977))

        The United States has an international obligation under various
treaties to verify this information and take steps to change the
international scheduling of marijuana.  Meanwhile, the subject of where
marijuana should be scheduled pending treaty amendment is open for debate.

        Twenty five years ago the government acknowledged marijuana did not
deserve schedule I status. Unfortunately, however, it decided to wait for
more evidence before ending marijuana prohibition.  The scientific evidence
has been mounting ever since, and none of it legitimately supports
marijuana's schedule I status.

        Justice delayed is justice denied.  The time has come for an end to
marijuana prohibition, and to acknowledge that for the last 25 years
marijuana users have been denied equal protection under the laws of the
United States and its Constitution.

        (Jon Gettman is a former National Director of NORML, and is
currently enrolled in a doctoral program in the Institute of Public Policy
at George Mason University. His present research agenda concerns regional
development and the agricultural and industrial technologies required for
hemp-related development.  The petition for repeal was the result of a
research agenda concerning the policy implications of recent findings about
the cannabinoid receptor system.)

by Jon Gettman</CENTER>

<P>Cannabinoids are the active ingredients in marijuana, and
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the only psychoactive cannabinoid.
Excerpts from frequently cited journal articles follow the brief statements
below.  Because these excerpts are taken out of context, the reader is
encouraged to read the original journal articles.

<P>The primary marker of a drug with a severe dependence liability is
compulsive self-administration by animals in a clinical setting.  Animals
will not self-administer marijuana.

<P>Cannabinoids are non-toxic; lethal effects are non existent.

<P>The pharmacology of cannabinoids was well-characterized by the mid 1980's,
and indicates that marijuana does not pose greater health risks than
alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine.

<P>The discovery of the neural mechanism, the cannabinoid receptor system,
which accounts for the characteristic effects of marijuana began in 1989.

<P>Drugs with the highest potential for abuse have a direct effect on the
neurotransmitter dopamine; marijuana does not.

<P>Tolerance to marijuana has also been explained. It results from a natural
process and not cell toxification.  Research has proven that tolerance to
marijuana is not a characteristic of a dependence liability.

<P>Marijuana does not harm the immune system.

<P>The discovery of the neural cannabinoid receptor system provides evidence
of the physiological basis for the medical use of marijuana and
cannabinoids.

<P>Before 1989, because no one knew how marijuana's effects were produced,
scientists were allowed great breadth to speculate about the substance.

<P>Much of the harmful speculation about marijuana prior to the receptor
discovery has based in studies with severe methodological problems.

<P>Prior to 1989, many of these speculative hypotheses were presented to the
public as likely facts which supported various public policies; but no one
really knew what they were talking about.

<P>Primary Marker of Drug Dependence:  "[S]elf-administration of a drug to the
point where the behavior becomes obsessive and detrimental to the
individual is the primary criterion which must be met to classify a drug as
one with significant potential for dependence."  Cicero, T. (1992)
Assessment of Dependence Liability of Psychotropic Substances:  Nature of
the Problem and the Role of the College on Problems on Drug Dependence.
Contractor Document for the Office of Technology Assessment. (Springfield,
VA: National Technical Information Service.  1992.) (NTIS Doc.
#PB94-175643) pg. 6.

<P>Primary Clinical Test of Dependence Liability:  "If the abuse liability of
a substance as defined by the likelihood of it supporting drug-seeking and
drug-taking, is to be evaluated, an assessment of its reinforcing functions
by self-administration is clearly the method of choice."  Brady, J.V. "The
Reinforcing Functions of Drugs and Assessment of Abuse Liability."  In:
Problems of Drug Dependence, 1987.  Proceedings of the 49th Annual
Scientific Meeting, The Committee on Problems of Drug Dependence, Inc.
Harris, L. (ed.), National Institute on Drug Abuse Research Monograph 81.
Washington, D.C.: U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1988.  pp. 440 - 456. pg. 452.

<P>Marijuana Does Not Meet the Primary Test for Dependence:  "While
self-administration of drugs has been taken as an indication of
psychological dependence and/or abuse potential, few reports claim to have
established experimental models for self administration of Delta-9-THC . .
. This observation suggests limited potential for development of . . .
limited psychological dependence due to the weak reinforcing properties of
Delta-9-THC."  Abood, M.E., and Martin, B.R. (1992), "Neurobiology of
Marijuana Abuse," Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 13:201-206. pg. 203.

<P>The Toxicity of Marijuana:  "lethal effects of overdose by humans are
nonexistent or rare"  Dewey, W.  Cannabinoid Pharmacology. Pharmacological
Reviews. 1986 Vol. 38, No. 2.  pp. 151 - 178. pg. 172.

<P>The Extent of Parmacological Research:  "Our studies of cannabinoids over
the past 22 years have touched upon virtually every aspect of their
actions."  Hollister, L.  "Peregrinations Among Drugs of Dependence:
Nathan B. Eddy Memorial Award Lecture."  In: Problems of Drug Dependence,
1989.  Proceedings of the 49th Annual Scientific Meeting, The Committee on
Problems of Drug Dependence, Inc.  Harris, L. (ed.), National Institute on
Drug Abuse Research Monograph 95.  Washington, D.C.: U.S. Govt. Print.
Off., 1990.  pg. 36-43. pg. 42.

<P>The Relative Abuse Potential of Marijuana:  "Compared with other licit
social drugs, such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, marijuana does not
pose greater risks." Hollister, L.E.(1986), "Health Aspects of Cannabis",
Pharmacological Reviews, 38:1, 1-20. pg. 17.

<P>The Mechanism of Action for Cannabinoid Effects:  " [Quantatative
radiography has established that a cannabinoid receptor system in the
brain] "is the same receptor [system] that mediates all of the behavioral
and pharmacological effects of cannabinoids . . ."  Herkenham, M., Lynn,
A.B., et al., (1990) "Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in Brain,"
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 87:1932-1936, 1990. pg.
1935.

<P>Marijuana And  Known Drugs of Abuse:  "The effects of cannabinoids on
dopamine circuits thought to be common mediators of reward are indirect and
different from those drugs such as cocaine and morphine which directly
affect extracellular dopamine levels and produce craving and powerful
drug-seeking behavior." Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid Receptor
Localization in Brain:  Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"  P.W.
Kalivas and H.H.Samson (eds), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol
Addiction, Annals of the American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992.
pg. 29

<P>Note:  Dopamine-based craving is believed to be neural mechanism
responsible for the phenomenon of denial, in which someone with a drug
dependency has strong urges to deny their dependency, and engage in all
sorts of fictions and escapades to maintain their supply and intake of a
drug. The accounts of patients who have used marijuana medically are often
dismissed on suspicion that these anecdotal accounts are motivated more by
drug dependency than therapeutic benefits.  The distinction noted above is
evidence that this sort of denial is not an element in patient accounts of
the therapeutic benefits of marijuana.

<P>Tolerance to Marijuana : "The magnitude of the present effect, like the
striking behavioral tolerance, may stem in part that, unlike other
psychoactive agonist drugs, cannabinoids can be administered in very high
doses.  It is ironic that the magnitude of both tolerance (complete
disappearance of the inhibitory motor effect) and receptor down-regulation
(78% loss . . .) is so large, whereas cannabinoid dependence and withdrawal
phenomena are minimal.  This supports the claim that tolerance and
dependence are independently mediated in the brain."  Oviedo, A., Glowa, J,
and Herkenham, M. (1993), "Chronic cannabinoid administration alters
cannabinoid receptor binding in rat brain: a quantitative autoradiographic
study." Brain Research, 616:293-302. pg. 300.

<P>Marijuana and Immunosuppression:  "In humans, immune suppression is subtle
and in many cases insignificant.  There is little evidence for cannabinoid
immunosuppression as a causative agent in disease."  Lynn, A.B., and
Herkenham, M. (1993) "Localization of Cannabinoid Receptors and
Nonsaturable High-Density Cannabinoid Binding Sites in Peripheral Tissues
of the Rat:  Implications for Receptor-Mediated Immune Modulation by
Cannabinoids"  Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 268:3
1612-1623. pg. 1620.

<P>The Cannabinoid Receptor System Discovery Explains Why Cannabinoids Have
Medical Value:  "Dense binding in the basal ganglia and cerebellum suggests
cannabinoid involvement in movement control . . . Anticonvulsant and
antiemetic effects of cannabinoids have therapeutic value.  The
localization of cannabinoid receptors in motor areas suggests additional
therapeutic applications.  Cannabinoids exacerbate hypokinesia in Parkinson
disease but are beneficial for some forms of dystonia, tremor, and
spasticity."  Herkenham, M., Lynn, A.B., et al., (1990) "Cannabinoid
Receptor Localization in Brain,"  Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, 87:1932-1936, 1990. pg. 1936.

<P>Before 1989, Theories Substituted for Facts About Marijuana's Mechanism of
Action :  "Because the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of action of
psychoactive cannabinoids were not understood, neuroscientists were allowed
great breadth to speculate upon the influence that these compounds might
have on the neurons of the brain." Howlett, A.C., Bidaut-Russell, M,
Devane, W., Melvin, L., Johnsons, M., & Herkenham, M.,  "The Cannabinoid
Receptor:  Biochemical, anatomical, and behavioral characterization."
Trends in Neuroscience  13:10, 420-423. 1990. pg. 420.

<P>Before 1989, Studies which Caused Some Scientists Alarm Were Based on
Faulty Research: "Most of the biochemical studies employed concentrations
of Delta-9-THC that were in excess of physiologically meaningful
concentrations that might be found in brain.  In addition, the criterion of
structure-activity relationship was not met -- that is, the potencies of
the various cannabinoids in the in vitro  assays did not correlate with
their relative potencies in eliciting characteristic behavioral effects.
Particularly damaging to the relevance of these in vitro studies was the
absence of enantioselectivity."  Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid
Receptor Localization in Brain:  Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"
P.W. Kalivas and H.H. Samson (eds.), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol
Addiction, Annals of the American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992.
pg. 19.

<P>Before 1989, All Sorts of Research on Cannabinoids Was Conducted Because No
One Knew How they Worked on the Brain:   "Until recently, very little was
known about the cellular mechanisms through which cannabinoids act . .
.Without evidence that cannabinoids act through a specific receptor coupled
to a functional effector system, researchers were prone to study the
effects of cannabinoids on membrane properties, membrane-bound enzymes,
eicosanoid production, metabolism, and other neurotransmitter systems in
vitro." Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in Brain:
Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"  P.W. Kalivas and H.H. Samson
(eds.), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol Addiction, Annals of the
American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992. pg. 19.

Substance Abuse: The New Paradigm
by Jon Gettman

Part 1 of 2.

Author:  U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment

Title: Biological Components of Substance Abuse and Addiction - 
Background Paper

Date:  September, 1993

Source:  Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office(OTA-BP-BBS-
117), 68 pgs.  $4.25 + postage from GPO (202) 512-1800.

        This OTA paper reviews medical research through 1992 
regarding the effects of various drugs of abuse on the brain, and by 
way of excellent references, provides a guide to the scientific 
literature for the interested public.  The paper provides:

        A discussion of the basic concepts of neuropharmacology, 
including the brain reward system, adaptive responses such as 
tolerance, dependence, and sensitization, and how the abuse liability 
of various drugs is evaluated and compared.

        A discussion of the specific effects on the brain of cocaine, 
amphetamines, caffeine, nicotine, phencyclidine, alcohol, 
barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates, cannabis and Lysergic Acid 
Diethylamide.

        A discussion of research on inherited traits that may 
increase the risk of drug abuse, primarily reviewing studies on 
alcoholism, with some mention of opiate-related research.

Significance:

        Research on several drugs of abuse has converged on a single 
point -- their impact on the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine 
and their subsequent influence on human behavior through the brain 
reward system dominated by that neurotransmitter.

        The paper reports on the current attributes used for 
evaluating the abuse potential of drugs. OTA reports that no research 
indicates that cannabis (marijuana) shares these attributes. OTA 
fails to discuss the ramifications of such a finding.

Excerpts:

        "The capacity to produce reinforcing effects is essential to 
any drug with significant abuse potential, whereas tolerance and 
physical dependence most commonly occur but are not absolutely 
required to make such a determination . . . The predominant feature 
of all drugs with significant abuse potential properties is that they 
are self-administered . . . Animal models of self-administration 
provide a powerful tool that can give a good indication of the abuse 
liability of new or unknown drugs."  OTA 1993 pg. 5.

        "While marijuana produces a feeling of euphoria in humans, in 
general, animals will not self-administer THC in controlled studies.  
Also, cannabinoids generally do not lower the threshold needed to get 
animals to self-stimulate the brain reward system, as do other drugs 
of abuse."  OTA 1993 pg. 34.

Discussion:

        The executive summary explains that susceptibility to drug 
abuse is influenced by such factors as the biological response to a 
drug, a person's psychological makeup, and the drug's availability.

Title:  Technologies for Understanding and Preventing Substance Abuse

Date:  September, 1994

Source Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, (OTA-EHR-
597) 260 pgs.  $15.00 + postage from GPO (202) 512-1800.

        Several committees of Congress asked the Office of Technology 
Assessment (OTA) to study the socioeconomic, psychological, 
physiological and genetic foundations for substance abuse and 
addiction.  OTA's report on the Biological Components of Substance 
Abuse and Addiction was published in 1993 (see above); this is the 
companion report that reviews social science research that has 
implications for prevention efforts.

        This report provides an extensive discussion of available 
data and the limitations of the studies that produce it.  Like its 
predecessor, it is a comprehensive guide to current research and its 
varying interpretations.

        This report does not address treatment or law enforcement 
issues

        There are not root causes for drug abuse, but risk and 
protective factors that influence the possibility of abuse within 
different sub populations in different settings.  Research into 
Necessary Preconditions, Individual Factors, and Activity Settings is 
reviewed, and policy options for prevention funding are discussed in 
conclusion.

        Appendices review the history of drug control policy in the 
U.S., existing federal prevention programs, and provide a list of 
original research papers contracted for this study and extensive 
references.

Significance:

        This paper re-presents the material from the 1993 OTA report.  
With regard to marijuana, while more research strides were made 
between the publication of the two papers, even less is reported 
about the biological basis for cannabis use than in the 1993 paper.

        Four models for considering prevention issues are reviewed, a 
Public Health Model, a Medical Model, a Criminal Justice Model, and 
the over-generalized approach of mass communications.

        Leading indicators of drug use are criticized  for several 
limitations, including the government's credibility, over-looked 
populations, measuring use but not abuse, and little opportunity to 
conduct multi-variate analysis.

        Teenage use of "legal" drugs precedes use of marijuana.

        The statistical results of 242 studies have been analyzed to 
sort risk factors into 11 major categories (50 sub categories), and 
to establish strong, moderate, and weak relationships between risk 
factors and school age drug use.

        Analysts are beginning to find the differences between drug 
use and abuse more interesting than the differences between legal and 
illegal drugs.

        Commercially marketed prevention programs, such as DARE, 
require extensive evaluation studies.  To date, the few evaluation 
studies that have been done do not indicate success at prevention of 
drug abuse.

Excerpts:

On the Brain Reward System:

        "Most drugs of abuse, either directly or indirectly, are 
presumed to affect the brain reward system.  Inducing activity in the 
brain reward system gives drugs of abuse positive reinforcing actions 
that support their continued use and abuse."  OTA 1994 pg. 45.

        "The rewarding properties of stimulant drugs such as cocaine 
and amphetamines are due directly to the effects of the chemical 
dopamine. Opiates, on the other hand, indirectly stimulate dopamine 
by activating other chemical pathways, which in turn increases 
dopamine activity.  All of these drugs have reinforcing properties.  
Phencyclidine (PCP) is also a strong reinforcer but its relationship, 
in any, to activity in the dopamine pathway has yet to be 
established.  Other drugs are either weak reinforcers or have not 
been shown to support self-administration in animal experiments.  
Nicotine stimulates dopamine neurons; however, its effect is modest 
when compared with cocaine or amphetamine.  Likewise, caffeine is a 
weak reinforcer, but the precise mechanisms of its reinforcment are 
unclear.  Finally, cannabis and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) also 
produce positive effects that clearly support their use."  OTA 1994 
pg. 47.

On the Stepping Stone and Gateway Drug Theories:

        "While study results vary somewhat, the sequence most often 
reported is that alcohol and cigarette use come first, followed by 
marijuana use and then by the use of other illicit substances."  OTA 
1994 pg. 74.

        "(T)he criminalization of marijuana may have caused some 
marijuana users to move on to other illicit substances through 
contact with the subculture of illicit users."  OTA 1994 pg. 74.

        In one study, "delinquency and youthful sexual activity 
tended to precede the use of marijuana and hard liquor. . . The early 
use of so-called gateway drugs, such as beer and cigarettes, may 
contribute to later problem behaviors, while the later use of 
marijuana, hard liquor, and other illicit substances may be more the 
result of extended participation in problem behaviors"  OTA 1994 pg. 
78.

        "Because many individuals who use substances do not go on to 
substance abuse, and because one level does not guarantee use at a 
higher level, these stages are descriptive but not predictive."  OTA 
1994 pg. 80.

On National Surveys:

        "Drug measures focus on use, rather than abuse or addiction.  
The common measures of drug use employed by the Household and Seniors 
Surveys - lifetime, past year, and past month use-are insufficiently 
refined to distinguish between casual and dependent use."  OTA 1994 
pg. 38.

On learning from those who use drugs without abuse:

        "What prevents some individuals from progressing from initial 
use to abuse to addiction? . . . Studying those individuals who do 
not progress from use to addiction may provide insights and lessons 
about how to prevent progression among those who do progress."  OTA 
1994 pg. 75

        "But what about those individuals who live in stressful and 
chaotic conditions - who are constantly exposed to many of these risk 
factors - yet who do not develop substance abuse problems?"  OTA 1994 
pg. 115.

On the Public Health Model for understanding abuse and addiction:

        "The legality or illegality of a drug is an artificial 
barrier that is not as relevant as the health-related considerations 
stemming from all types of drug use.  Rather than using 
legal/illegal, the public health approach categorizes drugs by such 
characteristics as addictive potential and long-term health risks. . 
.Dealing with the drug problem primarily as a moral problem is 
considered inappropriate and counterproductive (as part of the public 
health model)." OTA, 1994 pg. 29.

On Ethnographic studies of Marijuana Use:

        "Differences in marijuana smoking may also be partially 
attributable to gender.  In a recent review, it was shown that men's 
marijuana smoking was tied more to the  availability of the drug, 
while women's smoking was affected to a greater degree by social 
influences, such as weekday versus weekend smoking, and the smoking 
of their male partners. Women have also been shown to increase their 
marijuana smoking during periods of anger and other unpleasant 
dispositions."  OTA 1994 pg. 90.

        "Most of the ethnographic research on marijuana use has been 
conducted outside the United States.  Much of it was initiated in the 
1960's and 1970's . . .In Jamaica, for example, anthropologists Vera 
Rubin and Lambros Comitas directed a research team of 45 . . .Their 
controversial findings were that none of the deleterious social or 
medical consequences believed by many to be associated with the drug 
in the United States could be found among Jamaican users."  OTA 1994 
pg. 124.

Discussion:

        The findings OTA reports on marijuana are very exciting 
because of their possible impact on marijuana's legal status under 
federal law, however that is just one application of the technologies 
of this report, and but one measure of this report's significance.

        This is the most valuable report on substance abuse in the 
United States since the second report of the National Commission on 
Marihuana and Drug Abuse in 1973.

        The title is very important, and very revealing:  
"Technologies for Understanding and Preventing Substance Abuse and 
Addiction."  Ideas, theories, programs, policies, and though 
unmentioned, laws as well, are all technologies.  They are all 
subject to evaluation, or assessment, by conventional standards.  The 
drug war has reached a critical, and perhaps terminal stage where it 
has been going on long enough for empiricism to take over from 
theory.         This report represents the end of the "Just Say No!" 
monopoly on prevention efforts, one of the driving forces behind 
marijuana prohibition. Effectiveness is replacing strength as the 
standard of evaluation.

        OTA recognizes a prevention program market that receives one 
fourth of the funds given to local jurisdictions under the Drug Free 
Schools and Communities Act.  Three programs "have captured a sizable 
share" of the market, DARE, Quest: Skills for Living; and Here's 
Looking at You 2000. Only DARE has been evaluated sufficiently for 
conclusions to be drawn about the program.

        DARE is one of the better funded prevention programs and is 
delivered to 5 million students at a cost of $10 each.  Of the 
studies reviewed by OTA on DARE's effectiveness, "the average 
reductions in substance use were very small.  Use among control 
schools and DARE schools was roughly equal." (OTA, 1994 pg. 150-151)  
While the program has important strengths, school-based prevention 
technologies "have not been refined and tested enough to demonstrate 
their effectiveness."

        OTA commissioned a study involving 9930 statistical analyses 
from 242 separate studies reporting relationships between substance 
use by school age youths and its postulated causes, and OTA only 
summarizes the findings of this study in this report.  Tobacco, 
alcohol, and marijuana accounted for 82% of the completed analyses.

        Only four variables were held to have strong relationships to 
school-age drug use.  "1)  prior and concurrent use of substances, 2) 
substance use by peers and friends, 3) perceived peer attitudes about 
substance use, and 4) offers to use substances."  (OTA 194 pg. 147)  
Of the 15 variables with moderate relationships to substance use, 7 
were social variables involving resistance skills, peer pressure, and 
beliefs about consequences.

        These findings need to be examined in more detail, but they 
should be of immense help in evaluating the theoretical basis for 
many prevention programs which lack performance data for evaluation.

        The significance for policy discussions is that these 
findings suggest that availability itself is probably the greatest 
contributing factor to school-age drug use.

        The role of tobacco and alcohol marketing, and the role of 
head shops is discussed in the context of the availability of drugs 
as a necessary precondition for abuse.

        Distinctions are made between use, abuse, and addiction.  OTA 
is straightforward that substances differ in their abuse liability, 
and the line between use and abuse varies.  The goals of prevention 
programs vary between attempting to prevent initial use, delay 
initial use, or reduce or control continued use.  While there is a 
progression to the use of various drugs, OTA reports that these 
stages are descriptive, not predictive. There is considerable 
evidence that expectations play an influential role in drug use and 
abuse.

        Ethnographic studies and anthropology have begun to make 
important contributions to understanding substance abuse.  Four 
social contexts are recognized: a drug focused subculture, drug use 
as part of a larger lifestyle or identity, normal, recreational use 
among specific partners or peers, and use in social isolation.  
(Interestingly, medical marijuana use is provided as an example of 
drug use in social isolation.  Sad, true in too many cases, and 
unnecessary.)

        However, "most of the ethnographic research has concentrated 
on drug-focuses subcultures or on crime-related subcultures.  There 
are too few studies on other populations . . . (for example) no 
significant ethnographic studies of student drug use in almost two 
decades.  The drug problem has been defined in the public mind and 
among some funding sources as a problem of poor minority communities. 
. . Drug use and drug users are defined as the "other," different 
from the rest of society.  Ethnographers have paid relatively little 
attention to the relationship between culturally approved drug use 
(e.g., caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, psychoactive prescription drugs) 
and illicit drug use."  (OTA 1994 pg. 128-129)

        The elements of notable prevention programs include:  
promoting social and life skills, strengthening families, promoting 
healthy peer interaction, indirect and participatory approaches to 
substance use, and alternative activities.

        A considerable amount of material covered by OTA is not 
reviewed here.  This includes a review of all major drug use 
indicators and considerable discussion of the demographic differences 
in drug use by people of different genders and races.  Relationships 
between individual risk factors and aggressiveness, delinquency, 
physical and sexual abuse, and mental disorders are also discussed.

        Technologies are problem solving tools that have benefits and 
limitations.  This article has touched on a few of the technologies 
that are most relevant to marijuana law reform:  the brain reward 
system, the gateway drug sequence, the public health model, the 
isolation of primary causes of school-age drug use, the use of 
ethnographic studies, the elements of successful prevention programs 
and learning about drug abuse from drug use.  These are all tools 
that provide new ways to address, solve, and explain old problems.

        Advocates of marijuana law reform must become familiar with 
the latest findings in these and other areas, otherwise arguments for 
reform will become increasingly irrelevant as the context of public 
policy discussions evolves.

 Interview with Professor Raphael Mechoulam, Codiscoverer of THC

The International Journal of the Addictions, 21(4&5), 579-587, 1986.

        The interview was conducted by Stanley Einstein in Jerusalem 
on January 14, 1985.

        Mechoulam provides a brief history of research preceding his 
isolation of THC with Yehiel Gaoni in 1964, and discusses some of the 
possible therapeutic applications that can be derived from 
cannabinoids.

        "Probably the major barrier has been the unwillingness, or 
fear, by companies to develop drugs that are based on cannabis.  They 
are afraid, as I said before, of notoriety.  They were afraid that 
they would get into a jam of sorts.  So for the first ten years after 
our discoveries, essentially no work has been done whatsoever on the 
pharmaceutical properties of cannabis.  Even afterwards the work that 
was done, was done very, very timidly and very slowly.  Even when 
work done at a scientific level it was stopped at the corporate- 
administrative level . . . Most industries and governments do not 
know how to make use of scientists and scientific ideas."  pg. 587.

The Chronic Cerebral Effects of Cannabis Use

I  Methodological Issues and Neurological Findings

II Psychological Findings and Conclusions

The International Journal of the Addictions, 21(6), 605-642, 1986.

        (I) "On the basis of available research, it was concluded 
that there is no evidence that marijuana produces gross structural 
cerebral changes and little evidence that it leads to functional 
impairment, although subtle impairment cannot be ruled out." pg. 605.

        (II) "Evidence from both American and cross-cultural studies 
suggests that marijuana probably does not produce chronic cerebral 
impairment, although subtle impairment cannot be ruled out." pg. 629.

        This paper summarizes what research had determined about 
marijuana's effects on the brain by the early 1980's.

        This paper also marks a transition in the focus of research 
from brain damage to brain function.

Health Aspects of Cannabis

Pharmacological Reports, 38(1), 1-20. 1986.

        This article reviews a) the acute and chronic effects of 
cannabis in humans b) the possible adverse effects of cannabis on 
health and c) the therapeutic uses of cannabis.  This article is 
cited frequently and is considered one of the most authoritative 
analyses of cannabis-oriented research to date.  Subsequent research 
has tended to support Hollister's conclusions, particularly in regard 
to tolerance and dependence.

        "Tolerance is not a problem when doses are small, or 
infrequent, or where the pattern of use of the drug is not prolonged.  
Tolerance only becomes a major factor with high, sustained, and 
prolonged use of the drug . . . Large doses of THC are required over 
long time periods for tolerance to develop.  As most social use of 
the drug does not meet these requirements, neither tolerance nor 
dependence has been a major issue in its social use."  pg. 9.

Determination and Characterization of a Cannabinoid Receptor in Rat 
Brain

Molecular Pharmacology, 34:605-613.  1988.

        Prior to this study, "one reason for our lack of insight 
concerning the actions of cannabinoid drugs in the (Central Nervous 
System) is that a clearly defined cellular mechanism(s) for this 
class of drugs has remained elusive."  pg. 605.

        It had long been suspected that the effects of cannabis were 
mediated by receptors in the brain, but until this study the 
technology to determine and characterize these receptors did not 
exist.  Prior research had established criteria for a 
pharmacologically distinct cannabinoid receptor; this study met those 
criteria by using autoradiographic binding of a potent isomer of THC 
to tissues from a rat brain.

Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in Brain

Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA, 87:1932-1936. 
1990.

        Herkenham's research team applied the technology developed by 
Howlett's team to locating cannabinoid receptors in guinea pig, rat, 
dog, monkey and human brains.

        Receptors are most dense in the basal ganglia, hippocampus, 
and cerebellum, and are sparse in the lower brainstem areas 
controlling heart and lung functions.  "High densities of receptors 
in the forebrain and cerebellum implicate roles for cannabinoids in 
cognition and movement." (pg. 1932.)

        Addressing recent interest in dopamine release in the brain, 
Herkenham notes that:  "The presence of cannabinoid receptors in the 
ventromedial striatum suggests an association with dopamine circuits 
thought to mediate reward.  However, reinforcing properties of 
cannabinoids have been difficult to demonstrate in animals.  
Moreover, cannabinoid receptors in the basal ganglia are not 
localized on dopamine neurons."  pg. 1936.

QUAD-CITY TIMES <tt></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police sealed off Davenport's
Credit Island Park and made more than 30 arrests Saturday after a
melee broke out between officers and participants at a
marijuana-themed festival there. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Davenport police officer, Chad
Langager, 36, was hositalized and expected to undergo surgery for
a serious knee injury. One festival-goer who allegedly had been
smoking marijuana came away with a broken nose. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hempfest - which is intended,
organizers have said, to promote the benefits of the hemp plant
from which marijuana is made - was only 90 minutes old when the
disturbance began. The crowd intervened after police moved in
about 1:30 p.m. to arrest four people sharing a marijuana
cigarette, authorities said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There's no free day I'm
aware of where we're not supposed to enforce laws,&quot;
Davenport Police Chief Steve Lynn said. &quot;We tried to deal
with it as effectively as we could.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police set up a command center at
Credit Island Park before the festival began. More than 50
officers, including Metropolitan Enforcement Group officers and
sheriff's deputies, were on the scene. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynn said several people incited
the assemblage and called it &quot;a crowd of near-riot
proportion.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fracas, police reports
state that: officers were pushed, punched and spat upon; one
participant allegedly tried to wrench an officer's nightstick
from his grasp while others grabbed microphones in the park
pavilion and urged the crowd to resist police. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police used a substance called
Capstun similar to Pepper Defense Spray to disperse the 300 to
400 Hempfest participants who had come from around the Midwest. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witnesses said several children
were affected by the burning, choking mixture. Tamara Kirkland,
17, of Moline, said her 4-year-old niece had to be carried off
after she was sprayed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lynn said the accidental spraying
of some children was unavoidable because of the circumstances. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twelve participants, including the
Hempfest organizer, Bob Moldenhauer, 43, of Rock Island, were
arrested. Moldenhauer was being held in the Scott County Jail on
$1,040 bond late Saturday, facing charges of possession of a
controlled substance, trespassing, interference and possession of
drug paraphernalia. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police reports state that
Moldenhauer was told to leave the scene. He initially complied,
but then returned and tried to hand officers leaflets. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he refused subsequent orders
to leave he was taken into custody and had to be taken to the
ground before he could be restrained, according to the reports. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other people arrested were being
held on various charges, including possession of marijuana,
inciting a riot and assaulting a police officer. More than 20
people, many of them in their teens, were issued citations, but
were not held in custody. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of the Capstun spray
outraged some crowd members such as Josh Abney, 19, of East
Moline. &quot;They sprayed me, and I threw my Mountain Dew bottle
at them,&quot; he said. &quot;They made it a riot.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanya Wheeler, 19, of Moline, said
she felt the police provoked the fracas. &quot;The mace wasn't
aimed at people smoking,&quot; she said. &quot;They were walking
around spraying everybody. I had it in my mouth, and it burns
your throat.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other witnesses also said the
arrests were made with excessive force. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynn said the event never should
have been held in the park in the first place. Instead of
acquiring a permit, Hempfest organizers applied for the use of a
park shelter which only requires notifying the city's parks and
recreation department. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They trashed LeClaire Park
three years ago, and the city said they were not supposed to come
back,&quot; he said. &quot;But they circumvented the license this
time.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Hempfest was held in
September 1993 at Prospect Park in Moline, neighbors complained
to city officials, saying it was nothing more than a &quot;drug
party.&quot;</tt> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DAVENPORT -- What started out
to be a day of peace and love quickly descended into violence and
arrests, as this year's spring Hemp Fest at Credit Island Park
was closed early Saturday afternoon by police. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty-three people were arrested
on charges ranging from possession of controlled substances to
assault, and one Davenport police officer was seriously injured. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police and festival participants
alike described the incident as a &quot;riot&quot; situation. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 36-year-old police officer, a
16-year veteran of the department, suffered a leg injury that
requleed surgery at a local hospital. Because he is an undercover
officer, his name was not released by police. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police reported no other injuries. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday's festival began at noon.
Shortly before 1 p.m., police began making arrests.</tt></font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <font size="+2"><b><p>'Our intent was <br>
    not to close the <br>
    park down, but just <br>
    to monitor the <br>
    situation ....'</b></font> <font size="+1"><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officer Dave Kanaack, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Davenport Police</font><br>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<tt>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's when some of the
festival-goers violently resisted arrest and started
&quot;throwing bottles and rocks,&quot; said Officer Dave
Kanaack, one of about 20 officers at the scene. &quot;Our intent
was not to close the park down, but juat to monitor the situation
with regard to Iowa laws.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since possession and recreational
use of hemp, from which marijuana is derived, is illegal, Officer
Kanaack said, &quot;We're not just going to look the other
way.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, some of the
festival-goers held a different viewpoint. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's not right. We should be
able to do what we want,&quot; said Joe Smith of Rock Island, who
came to the festival just before the violence broke out.
&quot;Everybody was just having a good time until this started. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It just broke out out of the
blue,&quot; he said after police closed the island at 1:33 p.m. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Smith said many in the crowd
defended those who were being arrested. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Everybody stood up for
everybody else,&quot; he said, estimating the crowd to be about
1,000. Other crowd estimates were much lower. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Smith said police officers
used Mace to control and subdue the festival-goers. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officer Kanaack said &quot;there
was an accident with a police officer&quot; who was trying to
control one individual and &quot;some residual spray got in the
direction of the crowd. Unfortunately, a lot of people were
involved in this.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hubert Evans of Davenport, who
left the park just before the riot broke out, called the police
department later Saturday to complain about their treattuent of
the public. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't appreciate them
being so reckless with people's lives, walking around
intimidating people,&quot; he said of police behavior before
arrests were made. &quot;They were creating a military threat in
a peaceful situation. It was deliberately provocative.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It used to be so different
at the different locations. They were so much more lenient,&quot;
said Sharon Valle of Bettendoff. &quot;Occasionally, cops would
stop by and look intimidating. But it would be very
peaceful.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least three men still were
being held in the Scott County Jail Saturday night. According to
a jail spokesman, the men, whose ages and addresses were not
available, were: Joseph Loughead, charged with rioting and
interference with official acts; Christopher Rice, charged with
assault with injury to a Police officer, rioting and Interference
with official acts; and Michael Winterlin, charged with assault
with injury to a police officer, interference with official acts
and disorderly conduct. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hemp Pest organizer Robert
Moldenhauer of Rock Island was arrested and charged with unlawful
assembly, failure to disperse and possession. He could not be
reached Saturday for comment. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Davenport officer Saturday night
said the department may be perceived to be harsher than others
because &quot;we've always pretty much had zero tolercance on any
kind of drug activity.&quot; He said that reflects Chief Steve
Lynn's position. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday's melee wes not the first
time tensions have risen between police and attendants of Hemp
Fest in the Quad-Cities. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police made &quot;several&quot;
arrests in May 1995 during a festival at Loud Thunder Forest
Preserve near Andalusia. Charges ranged from possession of
cannabis, minors in possession of alcohol and contributing to the
delinquency of minors all misdemeanors. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rock Island County Sheriff
Department Capt. Richard Fisher said at the time that the Loud
Thunder event &quot;was a complete disaster.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September 1993, Moline police
received complaints of illegal drug use, fighting, open profanity
and yards being used as bathrooms during a hemp fest in Prospect
Park. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that event, Moline Police
Chief Steve Etheridge said officers declined to make arrests in
Prospect Park, fearing the actions &quot;would start a
riot.&quot;</tt> </p>

Staff writer </p>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DAVENPORT -- Hemp Fest
organizer Bob Moldenhauer said Monday he may move next year's
event to private property after the mass arrests at Saturday's
festival -- arrests he says were intended solely to silence him. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a vendetta against me --
it's not about the Hemp Fest anymore,&quot; he said. &quot;What
happened Saturday afternoon was a well-orchestrated effort,
pre-planned by the Davenport Police Department.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not true, police Lt. Dave
Struckman said Monday. Officers made arrests and closed Credit
Island Park only because some participants blatantly were
breaking laws and inciting riot, he said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A melee began after police tried
to arrest four people allegedly smoking a marijuana cigarette,
according to reports. Others in the crowd began throwing bottles
and rocks at police and using loudspeakers to encourage people to
resist arrest, police said. Mr. Moldenhauer said police arrested
him and the others to keep him and others from talking to the
crowd about Libertarian philosophies and decriminalization of
marijuana. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They wanted to silence me,
to keep me from telling people that government does not really
exist,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just a private corporation that
takes our money, and that's it.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody silenced Mr. Moldenhauer,
Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We gave him a forum,&quot;
he said. &quot;He had an hour and a half to exercise his right to
free speech. He could talk about anti-government, pro-marijuana
or whatever. But we had told these folks that we would not sit
back and let them violate the law.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some fest-goers openly were
smoking marijuana, even though police were nearby and had
supplied an &quot;amnesty barrel&quot; in which the public could
dump their marijuana as they entered, Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Our officers would have
loved to have been there and not had to do a damned thing,&quot;
he said, &quot;but it was too blatant to overlook.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police estimate 300 to 400 people
attended the event. Thirty-three were arrested on charges ranging
from possession of controlled substances to assault. During the
melee, a 36-year-old Davenport police officer had his leg broken
when Christopher Rice, 28, of Rock Island allegedly fought being
arrested, according to police reports. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Winterlin, 21, of
Bettendorf was charged with assault on a police officer,
disorderly conduct and interference with official acts after he
allegedly taunted police, chanted obscenities against the police,
spit in the face of one officer and punched another in the chest,
according to police reports. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That's inciting a
riot,&quot; Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officers employed a chemical spray
to subdue the crowd, but Mr. Moldenhauer said reports of its use
were exaggerated. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I only saw one (officer)P
using it, and I was standing right downwind from him,&quot; he
said. &quot;If he'd bee using a lot of it, I'd have known. It was
just an intimidation tactic.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jennifer Cooper of Moline said
police handled festival-goers too roughly. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;People who weren't moving
fast enough got kicked around and roughed up,&quot; she said.
&quot;One guy was still getting kicked after he was cuffed and on
the ground.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lt. Struckman said the police
department has received no complaints about officer's deportment
during Saturday's arrests. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fest organizers rented a city park
shelter under an individual's name instead of trying to get a
permit for the fest from the city, according to Scott County
Sheriff Mike Bladel, whose deputies assisted city police at the
park. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We weren't told we needed a
permit,&quot; Mr. Moldenhauer said. &quot;The city wanted things
to occur just as they did. I think next year we might move the
fest to private property. Then the police won't have any excuses
for this kind of thing.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That wouldn't stop police from
making drug arrests, Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Even on private property,
there are things called 'laws,'&quot; he said. &quot;It may be
private property, but if you open the event to the general
public, it becomes sort of public domain. Police could still be
there under-cover.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mr. Moldenhauer's view,
marijuana use is not prohibited by law in Iowa. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Under Iowa law, a person is
defined as a legal entity,&quot; he said. &quot;But according to
Black's legal dictionary, a legal entity is not a natural person.
So you can have all the pot you want because you're not a
person.&quot;</tt> </p>

<BR>QUAD-CITY TIMES

<TT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the disturbance that landed him in jail and led to 30 other arrests, the Rock Island man who organized last weekend's Hemp Fest at Credit Island Park says he has no plans to 
discontinue the semiannual event and will move it to private property next time.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I ain't gonna let 'em stop Hemp Past,&quot; Robert Moldenhauer said Monday.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moldenhauer, 41, faces numerous charges, including criminal trespassing and marijuana possession, in the wake of the melee that broke out when police and fest-goers clashed Saturday afternoon.  The event, promoted last week with fliers that included a hand-drawn map directing participants to Davenport's Credit Island, attracted as many as 400 people from across the Midwest.  Davenport police said.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moldenhauer does not dispute police reports that list him as the event's organizer.  He said he reserved a park shelter by paying $20, and then paid a $150 damage deposit at the request of 
the city of Davenport's legal department.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the past six years, he has arranged numerous other Hemp Fests in the Quad-Cities, he said.  Some of the twice-a-year events have resulted in disturbances not unlike the one Saturday.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But instead of bouncing around from one city park to another and being &quot;hassled&quot; by police, Moldenhauer says he intends to move future Hemp Fests to private property.  If police try to intervene, they will be trespassing, he warned.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And we'll deal with trespassers the way trespassers should be dealt with,&quot; he said, declining to elaborate.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He denied that the purpose of Saturday's event was to promote illegal drug use, even though the fliers intercepted last week by police suggested otherwise.  The leaflets advised participants to &quot;remember to bring a bud,&quot; a reference to marijuana cigarettes.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moldenhauer argues the fests are designed only to promote the benefits of hemp -- the plant from which marijuana is derived and to educate people about the government.  He said police quashed Saturday's fest, not because of its hemp theme, but because they wanted to censor his views.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They intended to shut it down primarily to silence me,&quot; he said.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The government doesn't like to hear what I have to say because it exposes them as extortionists.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police, who had a command center set up across the street from the park, said they were there only to monitor the situation and enforce the law.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They moved in after observing four people share a marijuana cigarette.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problems began when the crowd lashed out against the arresting officers.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some fest-goers formed a circle around officers, yelled obscenities and threw bottles at them.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One officer suffered a broken leg while trying to restrain one of the participants.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 36-year-old officer was recovering Monday at a Davenport hospital after he underwent surgery Saturday afternoon.</TT>

<TT>Rally Report
<BR>by Chris Rice

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday, May 16th, 1996 couldn't have been a more beautiful day for the Quad Cities Hemp Coalition's twelth semiannual Hempfest being held on Credit Island on the Mississippi River in Davenpot, Iowa.  It soon became apparent that this fest wasn't going to be as groovy as the others.  A heavy police presence greeted Hempsters, and police "Amnesty Barrels" decorated the entrance to the island.  Only an hour into the event, which started at High Noon, the police moved into the center of the crowd and attempted to search a woman's purse who had been seen smoking some kind of "hand rolled cigarette."  Members of the crowd informed the woman, who was not under arrest at the time, that she did not have to consent to a search.  The officer tugged on the purse while pursuading the woman to give it up.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, police decended on the crowd from their temporary island command post, slamming fest participants to the ground and spraying capstun on the crowd indiscriminately.  Thirty-three were arrested and hundreds were cleared from the island.  A police officer's leg was broken when another officer fell on him.  Chris Rice, a fest organizer, was charged with breaking the officer's leg even though he was faced down on the ground and handcuffed at the time.  Local news broadcasts showed a woman looking for her baby being sprayed in the face repeatedly with capstun.  Davenport police chief Steve Lynn (business phone # 319-326-7778) was present for the entire event.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A demonstration in response to this event is planned for Saturday, July 27th, 1996 at the Scott County Courthouse, 416 West 4th Street, Davenport, Iowa.  The police are saying that Hempfest is closed down for good and we need to show them otherwise.  Call Chris Rice (309) 794-9107 for info.

<FONT SIZE=+1><TT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, May 18th, 1996 there was a Hempfest held on Credit Island in Davenport, Iowa.  The police decided they were going to shut down Hempfest and showed up in full force.  They stepped up to the front of the crowd and attempted to grab a woman's purse.  When members of the crowd told the woman that she doesn't have to consent to a search, the police officers responded by slamming festival participants to the ground and spraying the crowd with capstun indiscriminately.  The police are saying they have shut down Hempfest for good.  They think that we will stop fighting for our rights!  Well that's not going to happen.  Now is when we pull together and make an axample of Davenport, Iowa.  We are going to come back stronger than ever!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way that the police and Davenport are going to stop us from having this type of gathering is to stop arresting people for Cannabis; free our friends and family doing years in prison for Cannabis; and allow us to grow a personal amount to consume in our own homes and on other private property with the consent of the owner.  Stop sending armed masked men in black to break down our doors, invade our homes, throw us to the floor, and drag us away in the middle of the night to live for years in chains.  Then, and only then, will we stop demanding an end to this atrocity!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are tired of being used as an excuse for politicians to tamper with the rights guaranteed to us in the Constitution.  We love America and we want her to live up to her promise.  It's a free country:  Like it; Leave it; or change it.  We intend to change it back to the free land our founding fathers intended.  If you can't stand freedom, maybe you should leave!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said, "They will change the law someday."  Ask yourself, "Who are they?"  It's obvious that the powers that be don't have concern for us.  "They" is us, "We the People".  It is up to us to force a change as peaceably as possible.  NOW!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a surprise to almost everyone when alcohol prohibition ended in 1933, and everyone was surprised when the Berlin Wall fell overnight.  Now we are up against the wall and it's time we start pushing.  We have the strength of numbers and the conviction of prior convictions.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are sorry if the police and courts set robbers, rapists, and murderers loose in order to prosecute us, but they have been doing just that for years!  The purpose of this action is to end this miscarriage of justice.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently people doing life in prison without parole on cannabis charges.  We are their only hope for freedom and they are counting on us.  Will you let them down, or will you wish you had done something when your turn comes?  If you don't do anything about this then you are also responsible because you allow it to happen.  Join with us and victory is ours!  Live in fear and you might be next!

<FONT SIZE=+1><TT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 in 4 black males between the age of 18 and 30 are in prison.  The leading cause of this imprisonment is the WAR ON DRUGS!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence has gripped many poor black communities.  This violence is a direct result of the WAR ON DRUGS!  When so many pecple are pushed out of the legal system and courts cannot be depended on for justice, violence seems to be the only alternative.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police have used the WAR ON DRUGS as an excuse to stop and search black males anytime they wish.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WAR ON DRUGS has done more harm to the black community than any other.  There are many divisions separating the black and white community but this is an issue which we can unite on.  Black, white, and hispanic united to stop this war ravaging our communities.  Join us!  We all want our brothers and sisters, friends and family back!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We advocate the legalization of Marijuana for it's peace inducing qualities and other industrial uses.  We do not advocate the use of addictive or hard drugs, but we feel that arrest and imprisonment are not proper solutions.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><TT>Spend a little money copying flyers for demonstrations and events.  Distribute them to friends, at the bar, at public events, concerts, 4th of July celebrations, and to the passer by on the street.

<P>Do not support businesses or buy products from companies that support the WAR ON DRUGS.  Call then and tell them why you will no longer buy their products even though you like them.

<P>Go to the County Clerk's office tomorrow end register to vote.  Vote pro hemp and against the DRUG WAR.  Write your elected officials and tell them what issues and positions will effect your vote in the next election.

<P>Tune your radio to AM 1420 between 2:00 P.M. and 6:00 P.M., Monday through Friday.  Tell talk radio host Jim Fisher how you feel about the WAR ON DRUGS.  If you are told that they don't want to talk about the WAR ON DRUGS today, it is easy to turn any other subject into a DRUG WAR subject.  To get on the air call (319) 344-7040.

<P>Pay for a billboard or a newspaper ad with a picture of friends and family imprisoned by the WAR OH DRUGS.  Include their name, age. charge. term, address, and a short biography describing how imprisonment has harmed them and their dependents.  People need to know that there are real people doing real time.  We need to put a face to a number.

<P>Attend demonstrations against the WAR ON DRUGS.  Attendance at demonstrations does not mean you are a drug user.  What it does is show the media that there are thousands of people that believe that there has to be a better alternative than a DRUG WAR that focuses on arrest and imprisonment.

<P>If you are in a band, write a song or two about this situation.  Pass out flyers at shows and use your pulpit to announce upcoming events.  Call (309) 794-9107 for information about a local compilation we would like to record to benefit this cause.  We will remember your efforts when we purchase recordings.

<P>If a police officer wants to search your vehicle or person, just say "NO!"  When they say "If you have nothing to hide, why can't I search?", tell them "It is my 4th Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search".  Stick to it.  You don't know if someone dropped a seed in your back seat.  Tell them to "go ahead and get the dogs" if threatened with them.  Let them waste their time.  You don't get any extra credit for helping them send you up.

<P>Think about whether you really want to smoke with someone who doesn't care if you could go to jail for doing it.  Expect people to back up their beliefs with actions.

<BR>
<BR>Hempsters demonstrate against the war on drugs.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Davenport, IA July 27, 1996.&nbsp;  The streets of downtown Davenport were infiltrated by a platoon of freedom fighters wearing tee-shirts that read "Bix smokes," armed with 10,000 flyers that describe the world renown jazz musician Bix Beiderbecke as a marijuana user.&nbsp;  Thousands of survivors from the Bix 7 Mile foot race and attendants of the Bix jazz music fest were eagerly snapping up the hand bills.&nbsp;  Meanwhile a few blocks away, a hundred hempsters demonstrated on the lawn of the Scott County Court House.
<BR>
<BR>A press conference hosted by Chris Rice, Quad City Hemp Coalition organizer, explains the demonstration's purpose is: to denounce the police macing and beating of hempsters at the May 18th QCHC rally at Davenport's Credit Island; as part of the Uniting Spirits march to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago to protest the war on drugs; and to educate the public of the role marijuana played in the jazz music community.&nbsp;  Speakers included QCHC Chris Rice, libertarian candidate Robin Miller, and Zenger Editor Jackson Clubb.
<BR>
<BR>Chris Rice told the crowd how police at Credit Island started the riot when they wrenched a purse from a woman's hands dispite her protest against search without consent.&nbsp;  Rice continued with how he was beat while being arrested for interferance with the search and how police claim that he broke a police officer's leg during his arrest.&nbsp;  Chris further told of his up coming trial and said, "The cops don't have a leg to stand on."&nbsp;  Read about Credit Island rally on the net at <A HREF="http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/NORML/QCHC/qchc.html"> http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/NORML/QCHC/qchc.html</A>.
<BR>
<BR>Libertarian candidate from illinios for US Senate, Robin Miller talked about the Libertarian Party platform entitled First Step Towards Freedom; included within he said, "Pardon everyone convicted of nonviolent drug offences ... to empty federal prisons of the marijuana smokers and others who are of no threat to society."&nbsp;  Miller pledged, "The Constitution is our contract with America."
<BR>
<BR>Jackson Clubb encouraged people to go to Chicago and participate in the Uniting Spirits march to the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp;  Clubb said that he was run out of town in the 1970's for organizing rallies and selling tee-shirts that read "Quad Shitties" depicting a cop beating a hippy.
<BR>
<BR>Others told how Henry County Illinios is one big drug war atrocity, where victims are intimidated by police into consent to search and are railroaded through court to jail.&nbsp;  A woman discribed how she served 12 terrible weeks in the Henry Co. jail for one joint.&nbsp;  Mr. Rice told of the excitement of cross country travelers when they see fields of wild marijuana; only to end up in jail for picking ditchweed that gives you a headache.
<BR>
<BR>No law enforcement was visible at the rally, except for two friendly Sheriff Dept. deputies who passed through on bicycles.&nbsp;  The demonstration concluded with 100 protesters carrying signs chantting, "Hay Hay HO HO, we don't want your drug war, Bix smoked reefer," and "We smoke pot and we like it alot."&nbsp;  Local press report "Hemp Fest Peaceful."

Dear Dr. Gieringer:<P>

Thank you for taking the time to contact me with your opinions.&nbsp;  As
your Senator, it's important for me to hear from you.<P>

I appreciate your comments regarding proposals to legalize certain illicit drugs as an attempt to address the problems of drug abuse and drug-related crime in America.&nbsp;  However, I firmly believe drug use is wrong and harmful and that it must stop.&nbsp;  This includes marijuana, a drug proven to be both harmful to the user and a major gateway drug for other, more dangerous substances.&nbsp;  Eighty-five percent of people who use harder drugs such as cocaine or crack admit to first having used marijuana.<P>

The effects of marijuana use are well documented.&nbsp;  Using marijuana
produces a dreamy state of consciousness in which ideas seem disconnected, uncontrollable, and free-flowing.&nbsp;  Time, color, and spatial perceptions may be distorted and enhanced.&nbsp;  Communicative and motor abilities are decreased during the use of these drugs.&nbsp;  Difficulty in depth perception and altered sense of timing, both of which are particularly hazardous, are also known effects of using marijuana.&nbsp;  Marijuana is addictive, causes difficulty with persistent memory and cognitive functions, causes personality changes, creates abnormalities in the lungs, creates abnormalities in the unborn, has residual effects on fetuses exposed in utero, and suppresses the immune system.<P>

The argument that the dangers of marijuana are overstated were more plausible in the 1960s and 1970s, when less was known about the full effects of this and many other drugs.&nbsp;  Today, supporting the idea of smoking marijuana for medicinal purposes is similar to supporting tobacco for weight or anxiety control.&nbsp;  There are better, safer, and more effective alternatives that are readily available whose side effects and interactive dangers are known.<P>

Claims that drug users only effect themselves and pose no threat to society are also misguided.&nbsp;  People who use drugs do so to alter their perceptions of reality.&nbsp;  When someone is high, they cannot be as alert to dangers that are always around us, dangers such as a boiling pot on the stove, a burning candle, or even something as simple as an open window.&nbsp;  Drug using workers are 3 to 4 times as likely to have on-the-job accidents, 4 to 6 times more likely to have off-the-job accidents, 2 to 3 times more likely to file medical claims, 5 times more likely to file workman's compensation, and 25 percent to 35 percent less productive on the job.&nbsp;  To claim that drug use affects only the user is to deny the reality that whatever we do effects those around us.<P>

The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) survey numbers on hospital admissions for drug related emergencies further confirms the alarming problems created by drug use.&nbsp;  At least 500,000 Americans ended up in hospital emergency rooms in 1994 because of drug-related episodes, 40,100 of these episodes were directly related to marijuana.&nbsp;  Marijuana is likely to be mentioned in combination with other substances, particularly alcohol and cocaine.&nbsp;  In 1994, alcohol and cocaine were mentioned during 48 percent of marijuana-related episodes.<P>

Please look at the statement that I made on the floor of the Senate that further addresses the idea of drug legalization.&nbsp;  Drugs are illegal because they are dangerous, they are not dangerous because they are illegal.&nbsp;  We need to work to keep our drug laws strong and effective.<P>

Once again, thank you for communicating your views to me.&nbsp;  Although we may disagree at times, I nonetheless appreciate and encourage your communication with me.&nbsp;  Knowing your concerns helps me to do the best job I can as your U.S. Senator.<P>

Sincerely,<BR>

RE: Public &amp; Scientific Support For Medicinal Marijuana<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agricultural Support For Industrial
Hemp/Marijuana<br>
&nbsp;***<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constitutional Violation By Present
Federal Anti-Marijuana Laws</tt></p>

<p><tt>Dear Senator Grassley:</tt></p>

<p><tt>* In the past months &amp; years you have continually
cited, mistakenly, that there is &quot;no public support for [decriminalization]
of marijuana&quot; and that there is &quot;no scientific basis
marijuana is harmless&quot; and that it has &quot;no medicinal or
public health benefit&quot; to be gained from marijuana. It is
believed your anti-marijuana position is but a reflection of the self-serving
status quo of the professional bureaucrats whose 'reports' you
steadfastly quote, ie, your exercise in sophist rhetoric as
contained in the Congressional Record for Monday, January 22,
1996. You were no doubt responding to the professional opinions voiced
in the 'National Review' opposing the Republican's Drug War as a
failed domestic policy. Your logic &amp; argument was skewered by
the fact you labeled a peace-making effort toward
decriminalization as &quot;Drug Legalization&quot;. By-and-large
the public rejected your thesis by voting in support of
decriminalization of marijuana this past November 5th in
Calfornia &amp; Arizona.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Of more recent note in yours of October 30, 1996, to marijuana
activist Carl E. Olsen of Iowans For Medicinal Marijuana, you
continue to parrot self-serving federal bureaucratic reports
&amp; statistics. You must at some point begin to realize the
questionable validity of such self-serving reports as the means
of those agencies' perpetuation. It would appear the public is
able to make this distinction while you are not.</tt></p>

<p><tt>It is time to take an honest look at the sick politics that
foster a war by [north] Americans against Arnericans. The
parallels of the Nazis against the Jews &amp; the Republicans
against the drug culture is all too familiar. The public
recognizes a negative &amp; failed policy as contrary to the
social conscience, and has made that consensus known by thier
recent vote for decriminalization of marijuana.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Regarding scientific findings, your stated opposition to medicinal marijuana
is not license for falsehoods, ie, &quot;There have been over
12,000 published scientific studies of marijuana, none of which
have shown smoking marijuana to be a safe or effective medicine
for the treatment of any condition&quot; as stated in your letter
to Mr. Olsen, then you go on to cite yet another self-serving
federal bureaucratic study(s). There are in fact several
published scietific articles supporting marijuana as a safe &amp; effective
medicine for treatment of a wide range of human maladys. You are
refered to the world's largest drug library @ DRCNet on Internet
and the Library at Iowa State U.</tt></p>

<p><tt>As a 30 year marijuana researcher, and as addressed in a previous
letter to you earlier this year (your silence giving consent), to
deny the phenomena of the many ancient &amp; current medicinal
uses of marijuana is to defy the logic of experience over the
years. To make the argument, as you have, I here quote your very
words as contained at the second to last paragraph of your
statement in the Congressional Record as aforementiomed: &quot;To
make the argument [against medicinal marijuana] requires ... suspension
of judgement, a willingness to accept assertations over facts,
and a professional absence of mind that ignores experience&quot;.</tt></p>

<p><tt>As an Iowan, I have to ask what would make such an astute Senatorial
poli tician 'ignore experience'? You say you have strong feelings
about representative government, but representative of who? Your
references are, without exception, the parrotings of the federal
bureacracy. The natural inference from that is you represent the bureaucracy,
or the bureaucracy wags the politician, as in the tail wags the
dog. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">As an ordinary member of the public, I find it suspect, if not outrightly
corrupt, that major pharmeaceutical special interests succeed in
gaining the approval of FDA for dangerous drugs far and away more dangerous
than marijuana. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">As a citizen, I detect the rotten stink of bureaucratic blocking
the availability of marijuana for legitimate research. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">As the son of an Iowa farmer, I question the authority of the
Federal Govermment to determine what crops a soverneign State may
produce within it's boundaries. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">As a taxpayer, I denounce any expenditure on a war against fellow Americans
for exercising thier right to pursue happiness by using marijuana. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">As a victim of glaucoma I've lost the sight of one eye as the
result of the bureaucratic repression you sponsor. On this point,
when government acts to deliberately damage a citizen, it's only
gain is a loss of respect and faith and trust replaced by an
intracable contempt. What you offer at the third paragraph of
page three in your letter to Mr. Olsen is yet further redundancy
of yet another government-funded institute which faithfully
parrots the bureaucratic line opposing marijuana. My personal therapeutic
experience with a multitude of FDA approved medications did not
lower my intraocular pressure sufficient to prevent optic nerve damage
&amp; loss of eyesight only occurred after the Feds acted to
curtail my use of marijuana. That is to say, most emphatically,
until government interference occurred, treatment by marijuana was
effective. Thanks to the Feds, I am today blind in one eye. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">As a matter of common sense, how 'euphoria' is undesirable or
harmful can only be the result of considerable governmental
sophistry.</tt></p>

<p><tt>You say &quot;science does not support these claims&quot;
that marijuana makes some illnesses easier. I believe, based upon
my own experience &amp; research, that you are stating an intentional
falsehood in furtherance of your political opposition to
marijuana and desire to carry-on your party's war against
marijuana. There is no sensible or humane reason to continue an active
war against a benign plant, a plant that has served man's needs for
centuries.</tt></p>

<p><tt>In light of the public support for and historical benefit of
marijuana, it would behoove a truly representative government to
move accordingly and at the very least free the plant for private
use &amp; study. This act may serve to restore some credibility
to politicians and government alike.</tt></p>

<p><tt>It must be recognized that the public is both better informed
&amp; educated than it was when the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act was
passed (by quorum) as a result of industrial fibre interests and
the need for the bureaucrat to justify employment [the BNDD
absorbing Treasury agents put out of work by repeal of alcohol
prohibition]. The public is aware of the federal-level skulduggery
employed to protect &amp; perpetuate federal employment. The public
has grown sick of federal political sophistry &amp; slease, and
have shown that contempt by not voting. The public now represents
a silent majority only occassionally stirred to vote when an obvious
change is needed and thier representatives fail to make that
change; thus California's Proposition 215.</tt></p>

<p><tt>&quot;The best available science, however, clearly and overwhelmingly
demon- strates the contrary&quot; you wrote in denial of
marijuana's beneficial effects. Although obviously oxymoronic, I
will again address the obvious: <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">The science authors you referenced {Leo E. Hollister, Dr. H.S. Greenberg)
conducted thier work under gov't grant, and that they conclude alongside
the gov't's position is no surprise. Those articles in various independent
medical journals all end noting 'inconclusiveness' and the need
for further study which is prohibited by the Federal Government's stramglehold
on the very substance under study. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">At the last few symposiums on marijuana, all government agencies invited,
stayed away, apparently prefering ignorance. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">Your continued oppositional stance, is, in the opinion of this
writer, untenable &amp; counterproductive.</tt></p>

<p><tt>** Marijuana as an agricultural commodity cannot continue to
be ignored. That we as a (so-called) 'free' nation must IMPORT
marijuana clothing, birdseed, paper, etc. is absurd in the
extreme. That a ranking member of the Senate Committee on
Agricultural opposes marijuana is positively ludicrous.</tt></p>

<p><tt>*** As a high school student, a course in U.S. Government was
required. The representatives upon being elected are required to
give an oath to &quot;defend the Constitution&quot;. We were
taught the Constitution was designed as a protection against
government's tendency to tyrannize it's subjects. We were taught
we had certain 'inalienable rights' in the Bill of Rights. We
were taught that ours is a 'dual system of government' under the
Dual Sovereignty Doctrine as expressed by the 10th Amendment to
the Constitution. The Founding Fathers' rationale behind the
mandate of separation of powers was to protect us all against encroachment
of a centralized government. The 10th Amendment clearly states
that the federal government is a government of very limited
powers, that for federal action to be legitimate, it must be
authorized by the Constitution. Congress clearly has no general
police power to legislate for the health, welfare, morals, etc.
of state citizens, and for that reason the Drug Abuse Prevention
Act could not have been enacted to prevent immoral behavior in a
State. What has actually occurred is the passage of a criminal
statute under guise of a commercial regulation.</tt></p>

<p><tt>The only authority that Congress could have used in enacting
the Substance Abuse Control Act was the Commerce Clause, however
is voided by the Supremacy Clause as it can only be invoked when
a State law conflicts or impairs a federal statute, negated by
the fact the State of Iowa adopted the Uniform Substance Control
Act. Extraterritorial application of a federal statute can only apply
when a statute is solely and exclusively the subject matter of
the federal government within a sovereign State of the union. The
federal government is otherwise not constitutionally allowed any
police power within the sovereign states. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">When the federal government claims jurisdiction over a subject
matter, it must do so exclusively over the whole of the entirety
of the subject matter, (ie, marijuana) to retain jurisdiction
over said subject matter. Thus, the federal statutes
criminalizing or scheduling marijuana is a prima facie
unconstitutional statute, and those federal representatives enacting
it violated the very oath they were sworn to, ie, defending ine Constitution.</tt></p>

<p><tt>The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Wm. Rehnquist,
recently addressed federal Congressional over-reaching thus:
&quot;[t]he Constitution creates a Federal Government of
enumerated powers. See U.S. Const., Art. I, Section 8 ... the
powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal
government are few and defined. (emphasis added) Those which are to
remain in the State governments are numerous and
indefinite.&quot; Lopez 115 S.Ct. 1624 at 1626 &amp; The
Federalist No. 45, pp. 292-293. The fear of federal tyranny is
great when Congress legislates beyond it's express authority.
Never has the Supreme Court declared that Congress may use a trivial commerce
impact as an excuse for broad regulation, let alone criminalization,
of state or private activities. Lopez at 1629.</tt></p>

<p align="center"><tt>* * * * * * * * * * </tt></p>

<p><tt>Given the wide social acceptance of marijuana citing 20+ million
users (U.S.) according to the U.S. Dept. of Justice (1993) the
time has come to recognize marijuana as a medicine, as a benign
&amp; mildly euphoric plant substance, as not dangerous (no known
overdose nor death resulted), all combine to obviate the social
need to reform marijuana laws. Given the public support for
marijuana decriminalization, politicians have lost their best
excuse for failing to act responsibly. Agricultural interests are expanding
to include marijuana as a viable &amp; highly versatile crop commodity.
The U.S. Constitution plainly does not allow the federal government
or it's representatives to declare a plant a crime (as in employment
justification for a distinct minority of federal agents &amp; bureaucrats)
in a State where they have no jurisdiction to begin with over the
subject matter, ie, marijuana.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Decriminalization of marijuana is proposed and advanced as a
means to begin to heal the wounds of the drug war &amp; restore
public trust in politicians and government. Laws decriminalizing
marijuana are needed to free the user of fear of his government's
oppressive tendencies. Remove an anti-government segment and gain
their involvement in the democratic process. There is tax
revenues to be appreciated from the legitimate marijuana
commodity federally and in each State &amp; locality (prohibitionary taxes
will have to end).</tt></p>

<p><tt>My support for decriminalization is limited to marijuana only.
I remain opposed to all dangerous drugs illicitly produced. My
position is the only danger posed by marijuana is the goverwent's
unsupported prohibition of it.</tt></p>

<p><tt>You are urged to recognize the public's broad support for medicinal marijuana
and the obvious need for decriminalization &amp; reform of
existing marijuana laws and it's absurd scheduling as a Class I
narcotic. The public knows better.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Please act responsibly. You represent the public, not the self-serving bur-
eaucracy.</tt></p>
