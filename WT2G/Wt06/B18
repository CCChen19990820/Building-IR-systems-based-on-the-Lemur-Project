Schoolpractice should be tailor-made tomeet the needs of every group orclass of adolescents.<p><a name = "4"><b>4.</b>  <b>Teaching and learning should bepersonalized </b>to the maximum feasibleextent. Efforts should be directedtoward a goal that no teacher havedirect responsibility for more than80 students. To capitalize on thispersonalization, decisions about thedetails of the course of study, theuse of students' and teachers' timeand the choice of teaching materialsand specific pedagogies must beunreservedly placed in the hands ofthe principal and staff.<p> <a name = "5"><b>5.</b>  <b>The governing practical metaphorof the school should be student-as-worker,</b> ratherthan the more familiar metaphor ofteacher-as-deliverer-of-instructional-services. Accordingly,a prominent pedagogy will becoaching, to provoke students tolearn how to learn and thus to teachthemselves.<p><a name = "6"><b> 6.</b>  Students entering secondaryschool studies are those who canshow competence in language andelementary mathematics. Students oftraditional high school age but notyet at appropriate levels of competence to enter secondary schoolstudies will be provided intensiveremedial work to assist them quicklyto meet these standards.

ThisExhibition by the student of his orher grasp of the central skills andknowledge of the school's programmay be jointly administered by thefaculty and by higher authorities.As the diploma is awarded whenearned, the school's programproceeds with no strict age gradingand with no system of "creditsearned" by "time spent" in class.The emphasis is on the students'demonstration that they can doimportant things.<p><a name = "7"><b>7.</b>  <b>The tone of the school should</b>explicitly and self-consciouslystress values of unanxious expectation ("I won't threaten you but Iexpect much of you"), of <b>trust</b>(until abused) and of <b>decency </b>(thevalues of fairness, generosity andtolerance). Incentives appropriateto the school's particular studentsand teachers should be emphasized,and parents should be treated asessential collaborators.<p><a name = "8"><b>8.</b>  <b>The principal and teachers shouldperceive themselves as generalistsfirst </b>(teachers and scholars ingeneral education) and specialistssecond (experts in but oneparticular discipline). Staff shouldexpect multiple obligations(teacher-counselor-manager) and asense of commitment to the entireschool.<p><a name = "9"><b> 9.</b>  Ultimate administrative andbudget targets should include, inaddition to <b>total student loads perteacher of eighty or fewer pupils,substantial time for collectiveplanning by teachers, competitivesalaries for staff and an ultimateper pupil cost not to exceed that attraditional schools by more than 10percent.</b> To accomplish this, administrative plans may have to show thephased reduction or elimination ofsome services now provided studentsin many traditional comprehensivesecondary schools.</ol><p><hr><p>Any list of such brevity and specificity begs forelaboration, and it is this elaboration that must firstengage the energies of each Essential school. The process ofdesigning programs and putting them into place will takeseveral years, and the inevitable adjustments then requiredwill consume some years after that. Due to its complexity,school redesign is a slow and often costly business. And dueto the need to adapt each design to its own constituency ofstudents, teachers, parents and neighborhoods and to createa strong sense of ownership of it by those who are involved,this redesign must be largely done at the level of theindividual school - even as that school adheres to theprinciples and standards common among the Coalition memberschools.<p><hr><p><a href = "principl.htm">Return to the Principles page.</a><p></body></html>

Students record as many observations about the sites as they can. At the obelisk, they copy historical information from a brass plaque, take photos of the four sides, and note the patterns of weathering by the faded carvings. At Umpire Rock, students describe the rock and the orientation of its five grooves; they also measure the length and width of these grooves.<P>	The following day in school, students write a reaction to their trip. This reaction piece constitutes the first entry in a Central Park Research Log, in which students will keep future research information, as well as write periodic reactions to the inquiry process and to their individual progress toward the Central Park Project's goal. After writing their reactions, students generate a class list of observations made at both sites, and inferences explaining the possible geologic processes responsible for the weathering and grooves they saw. From this list, the class collectively writes one investigation question for each site, designed to encompass and direct students' individual research. The questions generated by the class are usually along the lines of, "Why are the west and south faces of Cleopatra's Needle more faded than the north and east?"or "What caused the grooves on Umpire Rock to form?" Students choose one question to pursue for the next five and a half weeks. The question each student chooses then becomes his or her topic question, or "Big Question," and serves as both the starting point for scientific research and the guiding, driving force.<P>[Reproduced below are the major steps of the investigation process.]<BR> <B>Step 1</B>: Central Park Trip #1: Make observations and inferences at 2 geologic places about "What happened here?" in order to provide our BIG QUESTION for this project.<BR><B>Step 2</B>:  Background Information: Collect information from books, magazines, etc. to help us answer our Big Question.<BR><B>Step 3</B>:  Experiment: Conduct an experiment having to do with our BIG QUESTION. to generate more supporting evidence.<BR> <B>Step 4</B>:  Central Park Trip #2.

Out of the many questions, I was mainly curios to find out how glaciers change the land.  I was specifically interested in this subject because of the groves at Umpire rock. They lead me to believe that it was caused by glaciers and I need to back up my opinion with facts. I was also interested in finding out how do glaciers cause erosion? What are glaciers? And these are a few of the many questions that need to be answered.<P>	Glaciers are defined as a large body of moving ice and snow. The process of a glacier forming is when most snow that falls on the land and melts to form water running down over land surfaces.  However in some parts of the world it's too cold for snow to melt, so year after year it piles up. After a while all that snow is squeezed together becomes very heavy and the body of snow or ice moves.<P>	One kind of glacier is called a Valley glacier. Valleys are found in mountainous areas all over the world.  Their physical appearance are often rivers of dirty ice filling mountain valleys. Gravitational pull is able to move these valley glaciers. Meaning that gravity will pull it down to the ground away from the mountains. Valley glaciers creep down mountains at a rate of 25-60cm a day. As several valley glaciers pile up as they are being pulled down they from a large valley glacier. Valley glaciers are pulled by pressure therefore they don't flow, instead they crack. These great cracks are called crevasses. Crevasses also occur near the edges when one part of the glacier moves faster than other parts.<P>	Another kind of glacier is a Continental glacier. Continental glaciers are huge sheets of ice that cover thousands of square kilometers. Two such glaciers are called icecaps. Icecaps cover most of Antarctica and Greenland. Icecaps are shaped like domes. Their movements are caused by their great weight.<P><B>Glacial Erosion</B><BR><BR>Glacial erosion is caused when gravel and pieces of rock are frozen into the ice at the bottom of a glacier. When a glacier moves over the bedrock, the rocks in the glacier scrape across the bedrock. Small pieces of bedrock are carried away by he scarping rocks. These pieces of bedrock are pushed along in front of the glacier.<P>	As the glacier scrapes away the floor of the valley, the valley becomes U-shaped. Sometimes glaciers that are not yet properly formed flow into the main valley. These unformed glaciers are called side glaciers. When these side glaciers do disappear and melt, they leave small valleys high above the main valleys.  These valleys are called hanging valleys. Large rocks and sediments are often frozen into a glacier, as the glacier moves these rocks and sediments are carried to new places. As a glacier moves into a warmer area, the ice begins to melt around the edges of the moving glacier. After this happens the glacier starts to wear or shrink away. Rocks and sediments that were frozen in the ice are left behind. The materials that are deposited is called till.<P>	Big rocks, boulders by retreating glaciers are called erratic. Central park is known for having carried many boulders. The boulders are like bedrock located hundreds of kilometers away. The boulders are too heavy and too big to have been moved by running water or by humans. The only thing that could've moved these great big and heavy boulders is a glacier. It so happens that 65 million years ago The Wisconsin Glacier passed through Central Park. And most of the shaped rocks that this glacier formed has been more of the fascinating aspects of rock study in Central Park today.<P><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="LAB">LAB: GLACIAL TRAIL</A>Lab <BR><BR><UL><LI> Title: <B>Glacial Trail</B><LI><B>Introduction:</B> Based on the information from our first visit at Central Park on Umpire Rock, my lab will prove how it is that glaciers do change the land.<LI> <B>Materials:</B> Stream table, sand, gravel, ice cube, 2 bars of soap, and carton.<LI> <B>Procedure:</B><OL><LI> freeze the water carton to make ice - 2/3 of the way and put gravel and sand in also.<LI> fill the stream table with gravel and sand not all the way.  Leave space at the bottom.<LI> put the stream table at a slant position.<LI> put the ice on top of the stream table (make sure that you have a photograph for 	observation).<LI> If it doesn't move by itself you have to push it down gently until it reaches the 	bottom of the sand.<LI> allow it sit overnight.<LI> afterwards record observations and take photographs and also written observations.</OL><LI> <B>Results:</B> After letting it sit for 2 days, I found an interesting thing. The glacier had melted at the bottom and made a lake.  It left behind rocks on its way down. There was scratches on the soaps. One of the soaps were turned. There was a bunch of rocks at the bottom in the lake.<LI> <B>Analysis</B> - Evaluation on Lab:  After doing the experiment it all became clear to me. The glacier that had passed Central Park had also in my own little passed through the stream table.  At first the soap moved so we put it back to its original position and pushed it down again. The second time it still moved that explains the 2 different grooves that are scraped on the first soap. That second soap had its original grooves. This is how I was finally convinced that a glacier had passed Central Park.<P></ol><B>BEFORE</B><A HREF="b4grfx.HTM"><IMG SRC="BEFORE1.gif" ALT="photo of Pre-experiment" ALIGN=BOTTOM><P></A><B>25% OF ORIGINAL SIZE</B><BR><P><B>AFTER</B><a href="aftgrfx.HTM"><IMG SRC="AFTER1.gif" ALT="photo of Pre-experiment" ALIGN=BOTTOM></a><BR><P><B>25% OF ORIGINAL SIZE</B><P>	My second visit to Central Park was basically to rediscover more glaciers and also to prove to myself that what I've learned in class was definitely beneficial.  As I arrived at Central Park I was amazed at how I could identify everything that was at Umpire rock.<P>	I even found more glaciers in different places which I took pictures of. I also found erratic in different places. I also took pictures of them. The first glacier which is the original glacier that I based by Big Question, so I took I picture of it. The second glacier you could notice the difference because the part whether the glacier passed its lighter because it's worn out. The third glacier is also noticeable by vision. You could see the way that the glacial grooves scraped the land just by looking at the pictures.<P><a href="glaciergrfx.HTM"><IMG SRC="GLACIER1.GIF" ALT="photo of Glacier's Trail" ALIGN=BOTTOM></a><BR><B>50% OF ORIGINAL SIZE</B><P><HR><a href="eraticgrfx.HTM"><IMG SRC=" ERATIC1.gif" ALT="photo of Eratic Glacier Trail" ALIGN=BOTTOM></a><BR><B>50% OF ORIGINAL SIZE</B><P>	The first eratic was right next to the second glacier.  But the first erratic amazed me because it's just there, it has no connection to the other rock that it's laying on. The second erratic was the same, except that this one was round. The third erratic was the same but architects but big metal poles to make sure that it doesn't fall on top of tourists because it's hanging.  I was very happy to identify everything that I saw. <P><!-- Anchor POINT Tag --><A NAME="SYNTHESIS"><B>Synthesis</B></A><BR><P>How Do Glaciers Change the Land?<P><BR>	Every section in my report answers my Big Question in its own little way. For example, my background information tells my reader about a glacier itself. This information is provided so that the reader is fit to compare what happened at Central Park. My Lab section shows you physically what a glacier loooks like and also what it does. Then there are some pictures of itself. The diagrams are there also for visual use, to explain what is not seen in the pictures. Then I went back for more.  The next section shows further knowledge of the even more glaciers and I decided to throw in some erratic, in which I talked about in my background information. There you also have pictures that very useful. And last but not least a diagram of Umpire Rock and indications of where my beautiful glaciers and erratics are located. There is also a map of Central Park, including where Umpire Rock is that.

I went to observe the Geological Features of Umpire Rock and Cleopatra's Needle. They both interested me, but after alot of thought, I choose to study Cleopatra's Needle or the obelisk as it is called on the Central Park Map.<P>	The obelisk is an ancient Egyptian tribute to Ra, the sun god. It was built in 1600 B.C. and brought to the United States in 1881.  However, it was not erected in Central Park until 1940. It is weathered away on the west side of the obelisk and not the east and so my question is why is the west side of the obelisk more damaged than the east? [See Appendix for sample photo of Cleopatra's Needle.]<P>	Cleopatra's Needle is about 60-90 feet tall. It is made of granite, a type of rock made from cooled lava.  Originally there were heilioglyphic's around the entire obelisk, but the bottom and most of the west side were Faded. Heilioglyphic's are the writtings of ancient Egyptians usually found in the toumbs of pharo's they have helped us to learn of the Egyptians way of life.<P> 	In order to answer my question, I have to study about weathering.  My guess is that most of the damage happened in Egypt by the sand and sun and so I'm going to see how that can affect a rock.  I will also conduct a lab on weathering<P>	I originally had planned to do two labs, however I wound up doing only one because a picture was found of Cleopatra's needle when it arrived and it was not weathered at all which eliminated all possible theories of weathering in Egypt. Since I was obviously wrong about my theory, I decided to point my research in a different direction, the possibility of weathering here, by acid rain and change of temperature.<P>	Acid rain is the result of burned coal, gasoline and other fuel oils being sent into the air where it is mixed with moisture and sent down with the rain. Since all of these fuels were mixed together with the water, the rain gets acidic and becomes acid rain. Since acid is a very strong substance it can wear away rocks.<P> 	Above are two pictures of Cleopatra's Needle. The large one is of the obelisk today and athough it is hard to see the side that were looking at is totally worn away. The smaller picture [of the obelisk in 1881] however shows the same side and all of the heilioglyphic's can be seen.  [Please note: This Photo is not included.]<P>	The lab that I chose to do was on rock ebrasion. It included testing how rocks wear away in different acid types of water. I used 3 marble chips and 3 granite chips, a scale, 2 screens, 2 jars and 2 plastic bottles.<P>	First, I soaked the rocks overnight. The following day I drained them and weighed them. The granite weighed 41.4 grams and the marble 23.2 grams.  I then proceeded in putting the rocks in separate bottles partly filled with water and shaking them for 3 minuetes. I then weighed them again and found that the Granite was weared away, there were little pieces of the rocks on the bottom of the bottle.  Also its weight was now 39 grams. the marble though went up to 23.3 grams. The marble was acting as a sponge. I continued doing this until I reached 15 minutes then I did the same with a weak acid and then a strong acid.  In all acid types the weight went up and down on both rocks.<P>	This lab taught me that acid rain can really cause a rock some serious damage. Even regular rain so I am now almost positive that rain had alot to do with the weathering of Cleopatra's needle.<P>	When I started the lab, I expected the acid to cause more damage. However surprisingly in the granite, the regular tap water made the most extreme changes. The cool thing about that is, it's probably the same water as rain water. I also learned from this lab that the difference between granite and marble in hardness is great. The have a big difference in weight too.  Although Marble is harder than granite, granite's original weight is much higher than marble.<P> Lab I used to study the effects of acidic water<P>Name ___________   Class  ________    Date _______<BR><!--Anchor POINT Tag --><A NAME="topicix"><B>Topic IX THE EROSIONAL PROCESS</B></A><BR>Investigation 34    Rock Abrasion<P>As rocks are carried along by the current of a flowing stream, they tend to wear into smaller and smoother pieces.

This time, it meant so much more to me because I knew more about it. I took pictures of three of the sides, The north, east, and west. I ran out of film before I got the opportunity to get a picture of the South, so I will draw it as best I can. (unfortunatly for the time of day, it was hard to capture the west side as nicely as the east, but your not missing anything, it is completly worn away.)<P>	After my second trip to Central Park, I got copies of weather maps and saw tthat he pattern of rain is generally from the south west to northeast which matches the weathering on cleopatra's needle perfectly. [See Appendix for sample weather map.]<P><A HREF="MAPGRFX.HTM"><IMG SRC="map1.gif" ALT="WEATHER MAP" ALIGN=BOTTOM></A><P>	I now have a new answer to my Big Question after my research. Cleopatra's Needle became weathered by acid rain. Because of pollution from fuel tanks, there is alot of acid rain in New York City and because of that Cleopatras needle became weared away on west and south sides which is where the rain generally hits the obelisk.<P>	I think that the city should look into trying to preserve the obelisk before it is worn away completly. Maybe put a plastic covering on it.<P>	There were times during this project that I wondered if I should have picked Umpire Rock, mostly at the beginning, but now that I have finished my research, I am glad that I choose Cleopatra's needle. I learned alot from the experiance of independent research.<P><P><HR><B>Bibliography</B>Acid Rain Article, Comptons MultiMedia Encyclopedia<BR>Central Park Map<BR>Weather Maps, Times Newspaper<BR>Alan, Bklyn College Academy<BR>Weathering and Erosion, Holt Earth Science<BR>What is Chemical Weathering?

The 550 students at Middle College represent the full range of diversity characteristic of New York City public high schools. Rather than "track" students, the school groups them heterogeneously in classes. Each student is supported in his or her choice of courses needed to complete an education at MCHS. At the heart of every student program is a sustained, supervised career internship program.<P>	The school  year is divided into three "cycles" of 13 weeks each. Each student has a schedule that includes four classes. Students begin MCHS with a course designed to introduce them to the world of work and help prepare them for internships.<P>	MCHS is currently in the midst of developing a "graduation by exhibition" plan for its students; one which would be approved as an alternate to the State's Regent Exams. In preparation for this change, students are involved in long-term research projects based on relevant, presumably stimulating topics within subject classes. In these projects, students direct their own research while teachers "coach" them.<P>	The Central Park Project described here is one example of student-centered research.  As such, it represents an attempt to give students the opportunity to explore a real, natural, and personally interesting phenomenon, and to develop the skills necessary for supporting an in-depth, accurate argument about the nature and occurrence of this phenomenon.<P>	The geology course culminated by the Central Park Project meets for one period a day throughout the 13-week cycle. The course is made up of students - typically about 25 - from all four grade levels.  It begins with activities designed to introduce students to the scientific inquiry method and provide them practice in using it. For example, students spend nearly half of an early class observing a photo (projected onto a screen) of tree roots breaking up concrete in a city park. The class then completes an exercise which guides them through the sequence central to the scientific method: making observations, then making inferences; then carrying out investigations and experiments based on the inferences. The aim of this exercise is to help students develop explanations of natural events, and to support their hypotheses with scientific evidence.<P>	Together, the class completes a two-column grid: on one side they write, "Observations (what we see)," and on the other, "Inferences (what we think happened)." Students try to describe the site in as much detail as possible, rather than hurriedly or superficially. They comment about each site, and determine the column to which each comment belongs. In doing so, students practice making distinctions between observation (e.g.,"the roots are above ground nearest the tree") and inference (e.g.,"the tree roots are growing bigger and cracking the concrete").<P>	From this group activity, the class breaks down into pairs to carry out a small-scale experiment related to the question, "How do the tree roots affect the concrete?" In small flowerpots, students plant bean and popcorn seeds in potting soil, add water, and cover the soil with a thin coating of plaster. Over the course of the next few classes, students check their seeds to see if the interaction between the tree and the concrete in the park has been successfully simulated.  [Note: Due to major size and time constraints, geologic studies often rely heavily upon the use of small-scale models. According to teacher Jean Watters, these models represent "an important, yet often not appreciated or understood learning tool."]<P><B>The Central Park Project</B><P>During each cycle that she teaches the Project, Jean takes students to Central Park for an initial observation/inference/questioning expedition. This trip usually takes most of the school day, as MCHS is in Queens and Central Park is in Manhattan. The trip is scheduled in advance, and students are prepared to engage in a rigorous, outdoors experience - for one particularly cold and snowy trip, Jean brought a camp stove to make hot chocolate for the group. Typically, a second teacher or adult accompanies Jean and her students.<P>	The Central Park expedition centers around two geologic landmarks: Cleopatra's Needle and Umpire Rock (see <A HREF="PERFORM.HTM">PERFORMANCE</A> to learn more about these landmarks). At each site, students make extensive observations and take field notes.  When the group meets next in the classroom, they use a grid similar to the one described above to record observations and make inferences.  Jean records the collective information from each discussion and distributes it to students the next day, for use as a resource.  From these discussions, topic questions are generated by students, for example: "Why are the west and south faces of Cleopatra's Needle more faded than the north and east?" or "What caused the grooves on Umpire Rock to form?"<P>	Once students have selected their topic ("Big") question, class and homework time are devoted towards researching the topic as thoroughly as possible, and students draw on books, magazines, and other resources. They are also given a format for taking notes. Using a double-column format, students write information from the source in the left-hand column, and in the other write how that piece of information help to answer their research question. This presses students to justify that the information they collect is relevant, and to make the connection between selected information and their investigation question. Information must come from at least four sources.  Jean maintains an informational folder for each topic, including potential research sources.  Her primary goal is for students to develop the ability to connect information to their personal investigation, more than the ability to locate data sources. Still, students are encouraged to seek information from outside class.<P> 	After students have completed a significant amount of research, they select a laboratory activity that will generate even more information on their topic. Jean provides sample labs for students to choose from, and devotes class time towards helping students develop an experiment that both tests their hypothesis and is scientifically sound. Students must submit an experiment proposal to Jean that includes the lab's title, materials, procedure, and a diagram. Once labs are approved, students spend three or more class periods conducting them (see <A HREF="PERFORM.HTM">PERFORMANCE</A>). Although students often work in small groups to complete an experiment, each is assessed individually for how well he or she documents and analyzes the experiment's results.	With information from the experiments under its collective belt, the class plans a second investigation of Central Park, again to last the full school day. One purpose of a return trip is for students to collect additional data and observations.  A second, more important purpose is for students to revisit the park armed with new knowledge and understandings, and to act and feel like "experts," who can view their site of choice with a sophisticated mind and pair of eyes (in contrast to their first visit).<P>	Upon arrival at the park, students are divided into two groups by site: Cleopatra's Needle or Umpire Rock, depending on which landmark each student has chosen and presented a research plan - including the materials he or she will need - towards the study of. The group meets later in the day to eat lunch in the park and share their learning.<P>	Throughout the Project, Jean provides students with guidance in sequence, strategies, and resources for their research. She sees her role as that of supporter of students' investigations. Accordingly, she helps her students develop appropriate strategies to carry out their investigations, and analyze and crystallize their discoveries. Much of Jean's guidance is informal, and provided on an as-needed basis, as questions arise both in and out of class. She provides all students with "scaffolding" documents like the one reproduced in <A HREF="PROMPT.HTM">PROMPT</A>, which outlines the steps of the Project. Other scaffolding documents include a blank schedule, to be filled in by each student, to indicate what he or she plans to do each day of the Project. These schedules are periodically renegotiated, as a student's investigation develops. <P>	Throughout the Project, each student keeps an investigation log containing his or her research information, as well as periodic writings about both the overall research process and his or her personal investigation. These logs represent the primary collection sites for students' research information, as well as for documentation of their thinking. Because the final written report documents the journey each student takes during his or her investigation, students' reports are derived directly from their investigation logs.final products<P>In the past, students were asked to follow a rather rigid format when writing the concluding report, or final assessment, to their personal investigations. Previously, a student's final written product for the Central Park Project was required to include the following components:<P><UL><LI> Introduction: An introduction to the investigation and an explanation of what was done, what was being looked for, where, and when. Also a map of Central Park, showing the path(s) taken during the investigation;<LI> Background Information: An explanation of the topic and background information from five sources;<LI> Lab Write-Up: Title, materials, procedure, diagram, results, analysis;<LI> Connectedness: A "synthesis" section, telling the story of the investigation - how the Big Question got answered. Includes a restatement of the Big Question, plus the information learned, how this information was discovered, where it was found, how it was analyzed, and how it all added up/fit together;<P><LI> Bibliography.<P></ul>	Today, rather than piece together a final product according to the above-mentioned format, students are asked to write a single, more holistic paper narrating the course and results of their inquiry. This paper should explain: 1) What the student knows; and 2) How he or she came to know it.  All of the information required by the earlier format should be included in the report, now discussed as a story, or personal recollection, of a student's investigation. In addition, the pieces of evidence which helped direct and support a student's investigation should be included in his or her final written product, such as: maps; photos; diagrams; photos of the lab experiment; lab data and graphs; weather maps; world climate maps; and the like. Jean changed the final product format to help students identify more clearly the connections between their information and final "answers," and to become more aware of their learning throughout the investigation process.<P><B>Peer review and reflection</B><P>Students engage in a peer review of the finished research report, with each completing a review sheet for another student's project. By reading another report on the same site, students are able to identify information missing from their own reports and/or find a different way of describing or explaining a piece of information. In this way, they get ideas for revising their final written products. These reviews also provide additional feedback, both to the writer of the report and to Jean, who consults peer reviews when reflecting on the strengths and weaknesses of the Central Park Project. Some of the questions students answer in their peer reviews are: What piece of information does the writer present in a particularly clear, concise manner, and how so? What information does the lab experiment provide to answer the Big Question? What pieces of information seem missing or unclear?<P>	Throughout the entire Central Park Project, Jean asks students to write reflections on the Project itself, both in terms of content and process (see <A HREF="REFLECT.HTM">REFLECTION</A>). Students are asked to write about what they are learning, how they are getting information, and what it is like to do research. Periodically, Jean collects the student logs containing these reflections. This allows her to check the progress of individual students and determine which, if any, need assistance; help students clarify their writing and thinking; and lead students either to more in-depth reasoning or to sources of alternate information.<P><HR></BODY> </HTML>

I want students to gain a curiosity about the way things are around us, to question those things we take for granted, to develop a stronger sense of curiosity and wider perspective.<BR>	"Most students have never done this type of long-term independent research project. I want them to develop the skills just as much as the geological content. I struggle with the issue of my intervention and ask how much is too much for an independent research project. How do you make the right intervention to help a student go from seeing grooves in a rock to understanding they are the result of a glacier? But, I see an incredible need for my students to learn how to defend and substantiate an argument. This project calls for these skills.<BR>	"When I first started I gave the kids 13 questions that they did research on in the lab and book information then went to the park to find examples. I realized that the opposite - seeing the site first - could be incredibly generative and motivating. Now we go to the park together, spend the whole day generating questions, then do the book research and labs trying to answer them.

Alternative assessment projects developed in the Science Department and other disciplines emphasize the kinds of cooperative and experiential learning that are essential for personal and professional growth. These projects reach students at all levels, in keeping with the school's movement away from ability--and towards heterogeneous--grouping. The changes in instruction and assessment practice necessitated by these projects are  consistent with Mineola's school mission, which includes this statement: "We believe it is our responsibility to provide for different types of learning styles and, therefore, to use various modes of instructions. We seek to stimulate active learning and expose students to a broad spectrum of knowledge through a wide selection of courses, a variety of out-of-class activities, and supportive services ...We seek to integrate school learning with life experiences and to teach students to do the same. We contend that our heterogeneous population must be served on the basis of the students' varied needs and abilities."<P>	The Mineola Mousetrap Car Project is an example of an alternative assessment project which has changed the structure of, and the evaluation of students in, the school's Regents Physics and Technical Physics 11 courses. In a two-month long project, students work in teams with their classmates to create a functioning vehicle from the base mechanism of a mousetrap spring. Building the car emphasizes the physics concepts of work, force, and torque, as well as the problem-solving skills required of scientists and engineers. In the Mousetrap Car Project, students learn about conceptual theories of motion through actual experimentation (e.g., manipulating the wheel diameter to affect the speed or distance of a vehicle). In this and other ways, the Mousetrap Car Project reflects the Science Department's belief that "embedded assessment, [and] utilizing a problem solving format, will provide both instruction and an evaluation of our students' achievement at a higher cognitive level."<BR></BODY> </HTML>

Several of the staff members come from other progressive, alternative high schools in New York City such as University Heights High School, Central Park East Secondary School, and City-as-School; other experienced teachers come from the city's comprehensive high schools.<P>		According to the school's graduation requirements, "The fundamental aim of Hamer High School is to teach students to use their minds well and prepare them to live productive, socially useful, and personally satisfying lives." Accordingly, "The school's academic program stresses intellectual development and political/social involvement in our society. Five 'habits of mind' are stressed: <P><OL><LI> helping students to learn to critically examine evidence; <BR><LI> to be able to see the world through multiple viewpoints -- to step into other shoes;<BR> <LI> to make connections and see patterns; <BR><LI> to imagine alternatives (what if? and else?);<BR> <LI> to ask, 'What difference does it make?  Who cares?'"<P>	As part of the school's development of an assessment process, students are evaluated on two Language Portfolios each year in the 9th and 10th grades. Language Portfolio work can be done in either English or Spanish. Rick Levine, one of the Humanities teachers, explains that the staff chose to focus on language because of the importance of "helping students become articulate and expressive people able to be understood by others and able to actively engage in persuading others about their ideas."<P>	FLHFHS is a newly developing school with a large bilingual population. Its teachers hope that the Language Portfolio evaluation process will help them focus on literacy, determine schoolwide standards, and critically examine staff discussions about what is valuable in terms of student work. Each teacher must read and respond to at least six Language Portfolios, all of which are regularly discussed at faculty meetings.<P>	One goal of the Language Portfolio is to help establish a portfolio culture throughout the school. A second goal is to introduce students to certain skills and habits of mind that will help them build graduation portfolios. The Language Portfolio system will continue to be revised as the staff clarifies its goals and practices. <P>  </BODY> </HTML>

The changes in assessment that are starting to be implemented school-wide involve students in determining the criteria for different levels of quality in their own work. "Students are not resistant to revising their work," principal Jack Schwartz explains, "because they have a clear understanding of what makes good work, and their desire to do good work is supported by the safe opportunities they are provided with to improve."<P>  	The students at Miller Avenue see their teachers take risks, and are encouraged to follow their lead. Written into the school's mission statement is that "curiosity, individual initiative and innovative approaches to teaching and learning are to be encouraged." In terms of assessment strategies, this means that students work alongside their teachers to create the criteria and rubrics used to evaluate student products.<P>	In Ms. Calone's second grade class, students learn how to evaluate different levels of work. Their first experience with creating an evaluation rubric occurs during a science unit on the solar system. This unit stresses research skills and creativity, and culminates in a Planet Poster Project, for which each student is required to create a 2' X 3' poster displaying at least nine facts he or she has discovered about a self-selected planet in our solar system. <P> </BODY> </HTML>

The eleven-week, multi-step project is done with each of Manorhaven's sixth-year classes, and will be done at the fifth-year level starting this year. The teachers and librarians who have participated in the Investigation Project have found it one of the most successful ways to prepare upper elementary students for the work they will face in middle and high school.<P>  	As Dr. Welles, the school's principal, writes in a letter to parents, "We are working with the students each step of the way so that they will know what to do and will be able to apply that knowledge to future tasks.  We want students to learn that research is finding answers to real questions - not merely 'school work'. The frustrations, challenges, and moments of triumph that any researcher experiences will be theirs as well."<P>	The educational approach Manorhaven School demonstrates through this project is one in which students initiate their own learning.

They keep their site in constant mind, and continually ask themselves how - if at all - new information helps answer their directing topic question. They articulate their thinking in written logs and shared conversations. Students also choose and conduct a laboratory experiment, designed to generate further information for stimulating and supporting their investigations. They make connections across various pieces of information, thereby developing new ideas while discounting old ones. Finally, students write a report, in which they develop a detailed, supported explanation of the geologic process(es) they believe occurred at their chosen site. Included in this report is documentation of students' research and thinking at all stages of their inquiry. <P><HR></BODY> </HTML>

The 550 students at Middle College represent the full range of diversity characteristic of New York City public high schools. Rather than "track" students, the school groups them heterogeneously in classes. Each student is supported in his or her choice of courses needed to complete an education at MCHS. At the heart of every student program is a sustained, supervised career internship program.<P>	The school  year is divided into three "cycles" of 13 weeks each. Each student has a schedule that includes four classes. Students begin MCHS with a course designed to introduce them to the world of work and help prepare them for internships.<P>	MCHS is currently in the midst of developing a "graduation by exhibition" plan for its students; one which would be approved as an alternate to the State's Regent Exams. In preparation for this change, students are involved in long-term research projects based on relevant, presumably stimulating topics within subject classes. In these projects, students direct their own research while teachers "coach" them.<P>	The Central Park Project described here is one example of student-centered research.  As such, it represents an attempt to give students the opportunity to explore a real, natural, and personally interesting phenomenon, and to develop the skills necessary for supporting an in-depth, accurate argument about the nature and occurrence of this phenomenon.<P>	The geology course culminated by the Central Park Project meets for one period a day throughout the 13-week cycle. The course is made up of students - typically about 25 - from all four grade levels.  It begins with activities designed to introduce students to the scientific inquiry method and provide them practice in using it. For example, students spend nearly half of an early class observing a photo (projected onto a screen) of tree roots breaking up concrete in a city park. The class then completes an exercise which guides them through the sequence central to the scientific method: making observations, then making inferences; then carrying out investigations and experiments based on the inferences. The aim of this exercise is to help students develop explanations of natural events, and to support their hypotheses with scientific evidence.<P>	Together, the class completes a two-column grid: on one side they write, "Observations (what we see)," and on the other, "Inferences (what we think happened)." Students try to describe the site in as much detail as possible, rather than hurriedly or superficially. They comment about each site, and determine the column to which each comment belongs. In doing so, students practice making distinctions between observation (e.g.,"the roots are above ground nearest the tree") and inference (e.g.,"the tree roots are growing bigger and cracking the concrete").<P>	From this group activity, the class breaks down into pairs to carry out a small-scale experiment related to the question, "How do the tree roots affect the concrete?" In small flowerpots, students plant bean and popcorn seeds in potting soil, add water, and cover the soil with a thin coating of plaster. Over the course of the next few classes, students check their seeds to see if the interaction between the tree and the concrete in the park has been successfully simulated.  [Note: Due to major size and time constraints, geologic studies often rely heavily upon the use of small-scale models. According to teacher Jean Watters, these models represent "an important, yet often not appreciated or understood learning tool."]<P><B>The Central Park Project</B><P>During each cycle that she teaches the Project, Jean takes students to Central Park for an initial observation/inference/questioning expedition. This trip usually takes most of the school day, as MCHS is in Queens and Central Park is in Manhattan. The trip is scheduled in advance, and students are prepared to engage in a rigorous, outdoors experience - for one particularly cold and snowy trip, Jean brought a camp stove to make hot chocolate for the group. Typically, a second teacher or adult accompanies Jean and her students.<P>	The Central Park expedition centers around two geologic landmarks: Cleopatra's Needle and Umpire Rock (see <A HREF="PERFORM.HTM">PERFORMANCE</A> to learn more about these landmarks). At each site, students make extensive observations and take field notes.  When the group meets next in the classroom, they use a grid similar to the one described above to record observations and make inferences.  Jean records the collective information from each discussion and distributes it to students the next day, for use as a resource.  From these discussions, topic questions are generated by students, for example: "Why are the west and south faces of Cleopatra's Needle more faded than the north and east?" or "What caused the grooves on Umpire Rock to form?"<P>	Once students have selected their topic ("Big") question, class and homework time are devoted towards researching the topic as thoroughly as possible, and students draw on books, magazines, and other resources. They are also given a format for taking notes. Using a double-column format, students write information from the source in the left-hand column, and in the other write how that piece of information help to answer their research question. This presses students to justify that the information they collect is relevant, and to make the connection between selected information and their investigation question. Information must come from at least four sources.  Jean maintains an informational folder for each topic, including potential research sources.  Her primary goal is for students to develop the ability to connect information to their personal investigation, more than the ability to locate data sources. Still, students are encouraged to seek information from outside class.<P> 	After students have completed a significant amount of research, they select a laboratory activity that will generate even more information on their topic. Jean provides sample labs for students to choose from, and devotes class time towards helping students develop an experiment that both tests their hypothesis and is scientifically sound. Students must submit an experiment proposal to Jean that includes the lab's title, materials, procedure, and a diagram. Once labs are approved, students spend three or more class periods conducting them (see <A HREF="PERFORM.HTM">PERFORMANCE</A>). Although students often work in small groups to complete an experiment, each is assessed individually for how well he or she documents and analyzes the experiment's results.	With information from the experiments under its collective belt, the class plans a second investigation of Central Park, again to last the full school day. One purpose of a return trip is for students to collect additional data and observations.  A second, more important purpose is for students to revisit the park armed with new knowledge and understandings, and to act and feel like "experts," who can view their site of choice with a sophisticated mind and pair of eyes (in contrast to their first visit).<P>	Upon arrival at the park, students are divided into two groups by site: Cleopatra's Needle or Umpire Rock, depending on which landmark each student has chosen and presented a research plan - including the materials he or she will need - towards the study of. The group meets later in the day to eat lunch in the park and share their learning.<P>	Throughout the Project, Jean provides students with guidance in sequence, strategies, and resources for their research. She sees her role as that of supporter of students' investigations. Accordingly, she helps her students develop appropriate strategies to carry out their investigations, and analyze and crystallize their discoveries. Much of Jean's guidance is informal, and provided on an as-needed basis, as questions arise both in and out of class. She provides all students with "scaffolding" documents like the one reproduced in <A HREF="PROMPT.HTM">PROMPT</A>, which outlines the steps of the Project. Other scaffolding documents include a blank schedule, to be filled in by each student, to indicate what he or she plans to do each day of the Project. These schedules are periodically renegotiated, as a student's investigation develops. <P>	Throughout the Project, each student keeps an investigation log containing his or her research information, as well as periodic writings about both the overall research process and his or her personal investigation. These logs represent the primary collection sites for students' research information, as well as for documentation of their thinking. Because the final written report documents the journey each student takes during his or her investigation, students' reports are derived directly from their investigation logs.final products<P>In the past, students were asked to follow a rather rigid format when writing the concluding report, or final assessment, to their personal investigations. Previously, a student's final written product for the Central Park Project was required to include the following components:<P><UL><LI> Introduction: An introduction to the investigation and an explanation of what was done, what was being looked for, where, and when. Also a map of Central Park, showing the path(s) taken during the investigation;<LI> Background Information: An explanation of the topic and background information from five sources;<LI> Lab Write-Up: Title, materials, procedure, diagram, results, analysis;<LI> Connectedness: A "synthesis" section, telling the story of the investigation - how the Big Question got answered. Includes a restatement of the Big Question, plus the information learned, how this information was discovered, where it was found, how it was analyzed, and how it all added up/fit together;<P><LI> Bibliography.<P></ul>	Today, rather than piece together a final product according to the above-mentioned format, students are asked to write a single, more holistic paper narrating the course and results of their inquiry. This paper should explain: 1) What the student knows; and 2) How he or she came to know it.  All of the information required by the earlier format should be included in the report, now discussed as a story, or personal recollection, of a student's investigation. In addition, the pieces of evidence which helped direct and support a student's investigation should be included in his or her final written product, such as: maps; photos; diagrams; photos of the lab experiment; lab data and graphs; weather maps; world climate maps; and the like. Jean changed the final product format to help students identify more clearly the connections between their information and final "answers," and to become more aware of their learning throughout the investigation process.<P><B>Peer review and reflection</B><P>Students engage in a peer review of the finished research report, with each completing a review sheet for another student's project. By reading another report on the same site, students are able to identify information missing from their own reports and/or find a different way of describing or explaining a piece of information. In this way, they get ideas for revising their final written products. These reviews also provide additional feedback, both to the writer of the report and to Jean, who consults peer reviews when reflecting on the strengths and weaknesses of the Central Park Project. Some of the questions students answer in their peer reviews are: What piece of information does the writer present in a particularly clear, concise manner, and how so? What information does the lab experiment provide to answer the Big Question? What pieces of information seem missing or unclear?<P>	Throughout the entire Central Park Project, Jean asks students to write reflections on the Project itself, both in terms of content and process (see <A HREF="REFLECT.HTM">REFLECTION</A>). Students are asked to write about what they are learning, how they are getting information, and what it is like to do research. Periodically, Jean collects the student logs containing these reflections. This allows her to check the progress of individual students and determine which, if any, need assistance; help students clarify their writing and thinking; and lead students either to more in-depth reasoning or to sources of alternate information.<P><HR></BODY> </HTML>

Students record as many observations about the sites as they can. At the obelisk, they copy historical information from a brass plaque, take photos of the four sides, and note the patterns of weathering by the faded carvings. At Umpire Rock, students describe the rock and the orientation of its five grooves; they also measure the length and width of these grooves.<P>	The following day in school, students write a reaction to their trip. This reaction piece constitutes the first entry in a Central Park Research Log, in which students will keep future research information, as well as write periodic reactions to the inquiry process and to their individual progress toward the Central Park Project's goal. After writing their reactions, students generate a class list of observations made at both sites, and inferences explaining the possible geologic processes responsible for the weathering and grooves they saw. From this list, the class collectively writes one investigation question for each site, designed to encompass and direct students' individual research. The questions generated by the class are usually along the lines of, "Why are the west and south faces of Cleopatra's Needle more faded than the north and east?"or "What caused the grooves on Umpire Rock to form?" Students choose one question to pursue for the next five and a half weeks. The question each student chooses then becomes his or her topic question, or "Big Question," and serves as both the starting point for scientific research and the guiding, driving force.<P>[Reproduced below are the major steps of the investigation process.]<BR> <B>Step 1</B>: Central Park Trip #1: Make observations and inferences at 2 geologic places about "What happened here?" in order to provide our BIG QUESTION for this project.<BR><B>Step 2</B>:  Background Information: Collect information from books, magazines, etc. to help us answer our Big Question.<BR><B>Step 3</B>:  Experiment: Conduct an experiment having to do with our BIG QUESTION. to generate more supporting evidence.<BR> <B>Step 4</B>:  Central Park Trip #2.

Out of the many questions, I was mainly curios to find out how glaciers change the land.  I was specifically interested in this subject because of the groves at Umpire rock. They lead me to believe that it was caused by glaciers and I need to back up my opinion with facts. I was also interested in finding out how do glaciers cause erosion? What are glaciers? And these are a few of the many questions that need to be answered.<P>	Glaciers are defined as a large body of moving ice and snow. The process of a glacier forming is when most snow that falls on the land and melts to form water running down over land surfaces.  However in some parts of the world it's too cold for snow to melt, so year after year it piles up. After a while all that snow is squeezed together becomes very heavy and the body of snow or ice moves.<P>	One kind of glacier is called a Valley glacier. Valleys are found in mountainous areas all over the world.  Their physical appearance are often rivers of dirty ice filling mountain valleys. Gravitational pull is able to move these valley glaciers. Meaning that gravity will pull it down to the ground away from the mountains. Valley glaciers creep down mountains at a rate of 25-60cm a day. As several valley glaciers pile up as they are being pulled down they from a large valley glacier. Valley glaciers are pulled by pressure therefore they don't flow, instead they crack. These great cracks are called crevasses. Crevasses also occur near the edges when one part of the glacier moves faster than other parts.<P>	Another kind of glacier is a Continental glacier. Continental glaciers are huge sheets of ice that cover thousands of square kilometers. Two such glaciers are called icecaps. Icecaps cover most of Antarctica and Greenland. Icecaps are shaped like domes. Their movements are caused by their great weight.<P><B>Glacial Erosion</B><BR><BR>Glacial erosion is caused when gravel and pieces of rock are frozen into the ice at the bottom of a glacier. When a glacier moves over the bedrock, the rocks in the glacier scrape across the bedrock. Small pieces of bedrock are carried away by he scarping rocks. These pieces of bedrock are pushed along in front of the glacier.<P>	As the glacier scrapes away the floor of the valley, the valley becomes U-shaped. Sometimes glaciers that are not yet properly formed flow into the main valley. These unformed glaciers are called side glaciers. When these side glaciers do disappear and melt, they leave small valleys high above the main valleys.  These valleys are called hanging valleys. Large rocks and sediments are often frozen into a glacier, as the glacier moves these rocks and sediments are carried to new places. As a glacier moves into a warmer area, the ice begins to melt around the edges of the moving glacier. After this happens the glacier starts to wear or shrink away. Rocks and sediments that were frozen in the ice are left behind. The materials that are deposited is called till.<P>	Big rocks, boulders by retreating glaciers are called erratic. Central park is known for having carried many boulders. The boulders are like bedrock located hundreds of kilometers away. The boulders are too heavy and too big to have been moved by running water or by humans. The only thing that could've moved these great big and heavy boulders is a glacier. It so happens that 65 million years ago The Wisconsin Glacier passed through Central Park. And most of the shaped rocks that this glacier formed has been more of the fascinating aspects of rock study in Central Park today.<P><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="LAB">LAB: GLACIAL TRAIL</A>Lab <BR><BR><UL><LI> Title: <B>Glacial Trail</B><LI><B>Introduction:</B> Based on the information from our first visit at Central Park on Umpire Rock, my lab will prove how it is that glaciers do change the land.<LI> <B>Materials:</B> Stream table, sand, gravel, ice cube, 2 bars of soap, and carton.<LI> <B>Procedure:</B><OL><LI> freeze the water carton to make ice - 2/3 of the way and put gravel and sand in also.<LI> fill the stream table with gravel and sand not all the way.

The glacier had melted at the bottom and made a lake.  It left behind rocks on its way down. There was scratches on the soaps. One of the soaps were turned. There was a bunch of rocks at the bottom in the lake.<LI> <B>Analysis</B> - Evaluation on Lab:  After doing the experiment it all became clear to me. The glacier that had passed Central Park had also in my own little passed through the stream table.  At first the soap moved so we put it back to its original position and pushed it down again. The second time it still moved that explains the 2 different grooves that are scraped on the first soap. That second soap had its original grooves. This is how I was finally convinced that a glacier had passed Central Park.<P></ol><B>BEFORE</B><A HREF="b4grfx.HTM"><IMG SRC="BEFORE1.gif" ALT="photo of Pre-experiment" ALIGN=BOTTOM><P></A><B>25% OF ORIGINAL SIZE</B><BR><P><B>AFTER</B><a href="aftgrfx.HTM"><IMG SRC="AFTER1.gif" ALT="photo of Pre-experiment" ALIGN=BOTTOM></a><BR><P><B>25% OF ORIGINAL SIZE</B><P>	My second visit to Central Park was basically to rediscover more glaciers and also to prove to myself that what I've learned in class was definitely beneficial.  As I arrived at Central Park I was amazed at how I could identify everything that was at Umpire rock.<P>	I even found more glaciers in different places which I took pictures of. I also found erratic in different places. I also took pictures of them. The first glacier which is the original glacier that I based by Big Question, so I took I picture of it. The second glacier you could notice the difference because the part whether the glacier passed its lighter because it's worn out. The third glacier is also noticeable by vision. You could see the way that the glacial grooves scraped the land just by looking at the pictures.<P><a href="glaciergrfx.HTM"><IMG SRC="GLACIER1.GIF" ALT="photo of Glacier's Trail" ALIGN=BOTTOM></a><BR><B>50% OF ORIGINAL SIZE</B><P><HR><a href="eraticgrfx.HTM"><IMG SRC=" ERATIC1.gif" ALT="photo of Eratic Glacier Trail" ALIGN=BOTTOM></a><BR><B>50% OF ORIGINAL SIZE</B><P>	The first eratic was right next to the second glacier.  But the first erratic amazed me because it's just there, it has no connection to the other rock that it's laying on. The second erratic was the same, except that this one was round. The third erratic was the same but architects but big metal poles to make sure that it doesn't fall on top of tourists because it's hanging.  I was very happy to identify everything that I saw. <P><!-- Anchor POINT Tag --><A NAME="SYNTHESIS"><B>Synthesis</B></A><BR><P>How Do Glaciers Change the Land?<P><BR>	Every section in my report answers my Big Question in its own little way. For example, my background information tells my reader about a glacier itself. This information is provided so that the reader is fit to compare what happened at Central Park. My Lab section shows you physically what a glacier loooks like and also what it does. Then there are some pictures of itself. The diagrams are there also for visual use, to explain what is not seen in the pictures. Then I went back for more.  The next section shows further knowledge of the even more glaciers and I decided to throw in some erratic, in which I talked about in my background information. There you also have pictures that very useful. And last but not least a diagram of Umpire Rock and indications of where my beautiful glaciers and erratics are located. There is also a map of Central Park, including where Umpire Rock is that. I hope that you have enjoyed reading my report!!!!<P><!-- ANCHOR POINT TAG --><A NAME="SAMPLE #2"><B><FONT SIZE=3>Sample #2: DANIELLE</FONT></B></A>  (See <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="evaluate.HTM">EVALUATION</A> for an assessment of Danielle's performance)<P><a href="cleogrfx.HTM"><IMG SRC="snedle.gif" ALT="photo of Cleopatra's Needle" ALIGN=BOTTOM></a> <BR>On May  9, 1995 I went on a trip to Central Park.  I went to observe the Geological Features of Umpire Rock and Cleopatra's Needle. They both interested me, but after alot of thought, I choose to study Cleopatra's Needle or the obelisk as it is called on the Central Park Map.<P>	The obelisk is an ancient Egyptian tribute to Ra, the sun god. It was built in 1600 B.C. and brought to the United States in 1881.  However, it was not erected in Central Park until 1940. It is weathered away on the west side of the obelisk and not the east and so my question is why is the west side of the obelisk more damaged than the east? [See Appendix for sample photo of Cleopatra's Needle.]<P>	Cleopatra's Needle is about 60-90 feet tall. It is made of granite, a type of rock made from cooled lava.  Originally there were heilioglyphic's around the entire obelisk, but the bottom and most of the west side were Faded. Heilioglyphic's are the writtings of ancient Egyptians usually found in the toumbs of pharo's they have helped us to learn of the Egyptians way of life.<P> 	In order to answer my question, I have to study about weathering.  My guess is that most of the damage happened in Egypt by the sand and sun and so I'm going to see how that can affect a rock.  I will also conduct a lab on weathering<P>	I originally had planned to do two labs, however I wound up doing only one because a picture was found of Cleopatra's needle when it arrived and it was not weathered at all which eliminated all possible theories of weathering in Egypt. Since I was obviously wrong about my theory, I decided to point my research in a different direction, the possibility of weathering here, by acid rain and change of temperature.<P>	Acid rain is the result of burned coal, gasoline and other fuel oils being sent into the air where it is mixed with moisture and sent down with the rain. Since all of these fuels were mixed together with the water, the rain gets acidic and becomes acid rain. Since acid is a very strong substance it can wear away rocks.<P> 	Above are two pictures of Cleopatra's Needle. The large one is of the obelisk today and athough it is hard to see the side that were looking at is totally worn away. The smaller picture [of the obelisk in 1881] however shows the same side and all of the heilioglyphic's can be seen.  [Please note: This Photo is not included.]<P>	The lab that I chose to do was on rock ebrasion. It included testing how rocks wear away in different acid types of water. I used 3 marble chips and 3 granite chips, a scale, 2 screens, 2 jars and 2 plastic bottles.<P>	First, I soaked the rocks overnight. The following day I drained them and weighed them. The granite weighed 41.4 grams and the marble 23.2 grams.  I then proceeded in putting the rocks in separate bottles partly filled with water and shaking them for 3 minuetes. I then weighed them again and found that the Granite was weared away, there were little pieces of the rocks on the bottom of the bottle.  Also its weight was now 39 grams. the marble though went up to 23.3 grams. The marble was acting as a sponge. I continued doing this until I reached 15 minutes then I did the same with a weak acid and then a strong acid.  In all acid types the weight went up and down on both rocks.<P>	This lab taught me that acid rain can really cause a rock some serious damage. Even regular rain so I am now almost positive that rain had alot to do with the weathering of Cleopatra's needle.<P>	When I started the lab, I expected the acid to cause more damage. However surprisingly in the granite, the regular tap water made the most extreme changes. The cool thing about that is, it's probably the same water as rain water. I also learned from this lab that the difference between granite and marble in hardness is great. The have a big difference in weight too.  Although Marble is harder than granite, granite's original weight is much higher than marble.<P> Lab I used to study the effects of acidic water<P>Name ___________   Class  ________    Date _______<BR><!--Anchor POINT Tag --><A NAME="topicix"><B>Topic IX THE EROSIONAL PROCESS</B></A><BR>Investigation 34    Rock Abrasion<P>As rocks are carried along by the current of a flowing stream, they tend to wear into smaller and smoother pieces. Do all rocks undergo the same type of change under roughly the same conditions? What happens to the rate of change through time? In this investigation, you will study the physical [and chemical] changes that some rocks undergo in a short period of time by observing them in a model situation.<P><B>Problem:</B>  What effect do hardness of rock and length of time that the rock has been exposed to weathering have on the way rock particles are chnaged by physical [and chemical] weathering?<P>	<B>Objectives:</B>  After you have completed this investigation, you should be able to: 1) State the relationship between time and the rate of abrasion for a rock of particular type or hardness.  2) Compare the effect of abrasion, in a given period of time, upon rock types of differing hardness.<P>	<B>Materials:</B>  100 g pre-soaked marble chips, [quartz,] 100 g pre-soaked hard [limestone, chalk] chips, container and screen for shaking and draining, balance, water, [vinegar]<P><B>Suggested Procedure</B><BR>	A. Duration of weathering<BR><UL><LI>	Step 1  Obtain approximately 100 grams of pre-soaked marble chips and drain them to remove excess water.<BR><LI>	Step 2  Measure out exactly 100 grams of these chips on a balance and place them in a container about half full of water.<BR><LI>	Step 3  Close the container tightly and shake it for 3 minutes at the rate agreed upon before the investigation.<BR><LI>  Step 4  Carefully drain the chips through the screen so that none of the chips are lost.<BR><LI>  Step 5  Measure and record the mass of chips again, return these same chips to the container, and repeat the entire procedure three more times.  Record the mass of the chips after each 3 minutes of shaking, for a total of 12 minutes.<BR><LI>  Step 6  Record your data (mass remaining) after each 3-minute period of shaking, and graph the results (mass remaining vs. time).<BR></UL><P>	B. Differences in rock hardness<BR><UL> <LI>  Step 1  Obtain 100 grams of [quartz] (rock salt) chips.  Repeat the same procedure as above.  This time, however, ahke the halite for 3 minutes only.  Enter the data in the Data Table.<BR>Steps of the Procedure<BR><LI>  Step 2  Finally, obtain 100 grams of [limestone] chips and repeat the same procedure once again, but for 3 minutes only.  Enter the data table and graph the results (mass remaining vs. rock type).[Repeat this process for the different rock types in mildly acidic water and in strongly acidic water.]<BR><LI>  Step 3  Answer the Summing Up questions at the end of this investigation.[rocks we're using are marble and granite.]<BR></UL><P><A HREF="CHARTGRFX.HTM><IMG SRC="CHART1.GIF" ALT="CHART OF RESULTS" ALIGN=BOTTOM></A><P>During the course of my lab I copied the weight of rocks, minutes of shaking and acidic level on this sheet<P>		On June 1, 1995 I returned to Central Park to observe the obelisk a second time. This time, it meant so much more to me because I knew more about it. I took pictures of three of the sides, The north, east, and west. I ran out of film before I got the opportunity to get a picture of the South, so I will draw it as best I can. (unfortunatly for the time of day, it was hard to capture the west side as nicely as the east, but your not missing anything, it is completly worn away.)<P>	After my second trip to Central Park, I got copies of weather maps and saw tthat he pattern of rain is generally from the south west to northeast which matches the weathering on cleopatra's needle perfectly. [See Appendix for sample weather map.]<P><A HREF="MAPGRFX.HTM"><IMG SRC="map1.gif" ALT="WEATHER MAP" ALIGN=BOTTOM></A><P>	I now have a new answer to my Big Question after my research. Cleopatra's Needle became weathered by acid rain. Because of pollution from fuel tanks, there is alot of acid rain in New York City and because of that Cleopatras needle became weared away on west and south sides which is where the rain generally hits the obelisk.<P>	I think that the city should look into trying to preserve the obelisk before it is worn away completly. Maybe put a plastic covering on it.<P>	There were times during this project that I wondered if I should have picked Umpire Rock, mostly at the beginning, but now that I have finished my research, I am glad that I choose Cleopatra's needle. I learned alot from the experiance of independent research.<P><P><HR><B>Bibliography</B>Acid Rain Article, Comptons MultiMedia Encyclopedia<BR>Central Park Map<BR>Weather Maps, Times Newspaper<BR>Alan, Bklyn College Academy<BR>Weathering and Erosion, Holt Earth Science<BR>What is Chemical Weathering?

I never anticipated this Central Park component would be so important, but now I can't imagine geology class without it.<BR>	"I hope that through this project students will realize that seemingly simple things can be very complex.  I want students to gain a curiosity about the way things are around us, to question those things we take for granted, to develop a stronger sense of curiosity and wider perspective.<BR>	"Most students have never done this type of long-term independent research project. I want them to develop the skills just as much as the geological content. I struggle with the issue of my intervention and ask how much is too much for an independent research project. How do you make the right intervention to help a student go from seeing grooves in a rock to understanding they are the result of a glacier? But, I see an incredible need for my students to learn how to defend and substantiate an argument. This project calls for these skills.<BR>	"When I first started I gave the kids 13 questions that they did research on in the lab and book information then went to the park to find examples. I realized that the opposite - seeing the site first - could be incredibly generative and motivating. Now we go to the park together, spend the whole day generating questions, then do the book research and labs trying to answer them. This way, there is constant reason for everything we do, based on a real thing we saw."</BLOCKQUOTE><P><HR WIDTH=75%><p><B>Students</B><P><B>Patricia:</B><P><BLOCKQUOTE>"I'm learning teamwork, looking for information, not just waiting for Jean, and I showed interest. At the beginning, it was because Jean said to, but then it was cool. I would have gone back on my own if it wasn't so cold. She made us go in the middle of January and we just went there and observed and came up with our question - what caused those grooves. I remember I thought it was a volcano that melted.<BR>	"We went back knowing all the stuff we knew.  The second time it was colder but we were, 'Oh my God, look at those grooves!' She got me into seeing a geological feature. Before I'd say, 'I'm standing on a rock." Like that statue on 47th Street [Atlas]. Before, I'd say, "It's just a man.'

Alternative assessment projects developed in the Science Department and other disciplines emphasize the kinds of cooperative and experiential learning that are essential for personal and professional growth. These projects reach students at all levels, in keeping with the school's movement away from ability--and towards heterogeneous--grouping. The changes in instruction and assessment practice necessitated by these projects are  consistent with Mineola's school mission, which includes this statement: "We believe it is our responsibility to provide for different types of learning styles and, therefore, to use various modes of instructions. We seek to stimulate active learning and expose students to a broad spectrum of knowledge through a wide selection of courses, a variety of out-of-class activities, and supportive services ...We seek to integrate school learning with life experiences and to teach students to do the same. We contend that our heterogeneous population must be served on the basis of the students' varied needs and abilities."<P>	The Mineola Mousetrap Car Project is an example of an alternative assessment project which has changed the structure of, and the evaluation of students in, the school's Regents Physics and Technical Physics 11 courses. In a two-month long project, students work in teams with their classmates to create a functioning vehicle from the base mechanism of a mousetrap spring. Building the car emphasizes the physics concepts of work, force, and torque, as well as the problem-solving skills required of scientists and engineers. In the Mousetrap Car Project, students learn about conceptual theories of motion through actual experimentation (e.g., manipulating the wheel diameter to affect the speed or distance of a vehicle). In this and other ways, the Mousetrap Car Project reflects the Science Department's belief that "embedded assessment, [and] utilizing a problem solving format, will provide both instruction and an evaluation of our students' achievement at a higher cognitive level."<BR></BODY> </HTML>

In 1993-94, Mineola's two Physics teachers, Jim Gibson and Scott Spacie, and Eric Knuffke, an Honors Biology teacher, tried the option. For their part, the Physics teachers developed the Mousetrap Car Project and another, shelter-building project on solar energy to take the place of Part II of the Regents exam. The following year, all science teachers at Mineola were encouraged to adopt this approach, and Earth Science, Chemistry, and Biology teachers developed performance-based assessments to replace a portion of the Regents. These alternative components reflect all of the Regents' goals, but require more of students than the multiple-choice exam. <P><B>Two Courses:</B> <B> Regents Physics and Technical Physics</B><P>The Mousetrap Car Project is done with two groups of students: Regents Physics students whose work on this and the solar energy project replaces Part II of the Regents exam, and Technical Physics 11 students, who do not take the Regents exam but receive Regents credit for the course itself. An entirely non-Regents physics course is no longer offered, in keeping with Mineola's move from tracking and towards heterogeneous classes. <BR>	Tech Physics is offered as an alternative to Regents Physics, and often draws students who may never have considered taking Physics at all. It was designed as a two-tiered course to afford students the option of performing at a certain level to receive school credit, or at a higher level to receive Regents credit. In addition to the Mousetrap Car Project, students in Tech Physics complete three other hands-on projects (e.g., building a bridge or creating a shelter). Like the Mousetrap Car Project, these other projects involve student evaluation via an evaluation rubric. <P><LI><B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="mtrapproject">MOUSETRAP CAR PROJECT</A></B><P>The Mousetrap Car Project addresses concepts which are common to the Regents and Tech Physics curricula, including work, force, torque, motion, and Newton's laws. In Regents Physics, Jim Gibson's students study Newton's Laws and motion before the Mousetrap Car Project even starts, and while it is underway continue to study new, related physics concepts.<BR>	In Tech Physics, Scott Spacie introduces the Mousetrap Car Project through units on force and torque. As he explains,"We talk about the torque of the spring coming open and the torque of the wheels." In these introductory units, students ask themselves, "What happens when you make the radius [of the wheels] bigger, what happens to the torque, what happens to the distance traveled?"<BR>	Students from both courses work with their classmates in pairs or trios and spend approxÐimately two months on the project. Both teachers devote at least one double period per week for approximately one month to the project, and in this time encourage students to experiment with various approaches to running and making the cars. Classes meet daily, sometimes for single 45 minute periods and sometimes for double periods, for a total of 7.5 hours of class time each week. Some class time is spent on class practice runs of the cars. As Scott Spacie comments, "The thing that gets them going is the competition. They make a car they think is pretty good, then somebody blows their doors off and it's back to the drawing board." The teachers suggest possibilities, but much of the final car designs result from trial-and-error attempts on the part of the students. Some groups make several cars before deciding on a final design.<BR>	Students choose to focus on and prepare their cars for particular events. For example, some aim specifically for fast- or long-running cars while others aim to build all-purpose vehicles. To these ends, students are able to explain why they use different-sized wheels (i.e., to go faster or farther), as well as why their cars perform as they do. They demonstrate willingness to take risks and to experiment with different approaches to success.<P> Competition among students is good-natured, and students compare both their cars and their cars' results from in-class practice runs to the cars and results of their peers.<P><B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="mtrapday">MOUSE-TRAP CAR CONTEST DAY</A></B><P>In every corner of and spot on the gym floor, teams of students sit with bags of gear necessary for making last-minute readjustments. Students work with everything from pliers and string to extra wheels and strips of metal. It is their responsibility to go through each "station" and have their scores recorded on an official scoresheet. [See Appendix for sample photos of the four stations]. The gym is divided into separate areas for the four different stations:<P><UL><LI> A wooden slide approximately 6' by 5' is set up for the uphill incline station;<LI> A computerized mechanism is attached to one of the car's wheels to measure speed;<LI>The tractor pull consists of a piece of plywood loaded with various weights, which each car must drags across the floor;<LI>Distance is measured according to how far across a strip of the floor --the middle of the gym from the front door to the back wall --cars can travel when released.</UL><BR><BR>The day of competition falls during mid-term exam week, and the events last about three hours. Schoolwide scores are tallied the following week and winners are announced. (See the Contest Rules in PROMPT.) Teachers act as judges and record the numbered cars' scores at each station.<P><B><B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="fwork">FOLLOW-UP WORK</A></B></B><P>Lab exercises related to the Project are done in both Physics courses. For the Regents course, labs are included in the total number of points students receive towards Part II of the Regents exam; for the Tech Physics course, lab exercises count towards students' final course grades.<P>	Regents Physics students give and are graded upon oral presentations of their Mousetrap Car Projects. To learn about what other students are doing, Tech Physics students present to and hear presentations from students in another class, but these do not factor into their final project grades.<P><B><B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="MTRAP">MOUSETRAP LOGS and Monitoring Student Progress</A></B></B><P>Mousetrap logs are kept by students in both courses throughout the project. The logs allow students to describe, (and often vent their frustrations with), the step-by-step process used to arrive at a final car design. Logs include blank forms where students write brief narrative reports documenting what occurred during key periods of the car-building process. These narratives are supplemented with diagrams of the car at each stage. In Regents Physics, the students hand in their logs at the end of the project. Mr. Spacie keeps Tech Physics students' logs in class, and each time a class period is devoted to the project, he has co-working students show him what they have accomplished on their car that day. Then, together, they write down and create a drawing of any improvements or changes made to the car. (See<!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="perform.HTM"> PERFORMANCE</A>).<P>	Both Regents and Tech Physics teachers use posters to chart the progress and practice scores of each team. These posters are kept in the classroom so that students can compare themselves to past scores and to other teams. Keeping class records visible helps students stay focused on where they need to be going.<P><HR></BODY> </HTML>

A final competition serves as a backdrop for students' work. To prepare students for this contest, teachers demonstrate techniques for building cars, and explain the physical concepts behind their motion in class lectures and labs. Videos of the contest from previous years are also shown. <P>	The physics teachers use a fully articulated rubric to evaluate the students' work on their mousetrap cars. The rubric is given to students ahead of time and reviewed in class. Students receive differentiated points for the following categories: creativity, optimization, effort, craftsmanship, and performance. Each category has a range of points.  For example, the highest possible number of points in the creativity category is 10--Tried several non-traditional approaches in the initial designs.  Showed willingness to experiment with design--while the lowest possible number of points is 4--copied another design. No originality expressed in the design.

Unfortunately it didn't work as we planned --only moved 1/2 inch down the hall. (Hardly ready to win a race). Now we went straight back to the drawing board and knew what not to do. We designed a smaller "POWER CAR". With iolets screwed right to the bottom of the mousetrap we cut straws, to hold the wheels from sliding, and connected the wheels right to the trap. This seemed to work much, much, better.  When I pushed it down the hall it went all the way down. The only thing on our preliminary cart we have not figured out yet, is how to attach the string to the wheels for the power of movement.<P><B><FONT SIZE=2>DECEMBER 8</FONT></B><BR><BR><B>Performance:</B><BR>  	It went down the hall (about 10M)<BR>Comments: <BR> 	Once we figured out how to attach the string so the car would actually move it went at a decent pace down the hall.  But there was a slight problem. It curves. We figured out the iolets that attached the wheels and axel to the bottom of the mousetrap were crooked causing it to curve. So by the end of the double period we decided now we have a "scratch model" let's rebuild it. So we gathered our materials together for the next week.<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>DECEMBER 14</B></FONT><BR><BR><B>Performance:</B><BR>  	Spun in circles --very exasperating.<BR><B>Comments:</B><BR>  	Well, today was not a good day for our cart.  We realized (after all it would do is spin in circles) the iolets were not put on the mousetrap straight and that's why it spun.  So we took the rest of the time to carefully measure out where to put the iolets.  The cart still didn't go straight.  I think the axels are bent, so next time we'll cut new ones so they are ensured to be straight.  And hopefully our cart will move!!!<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>DECEMBER 22</B></FONT><BR><BR><B>Performance: </B><BR> 	Our car stinks!  It moves about 1 ft. then does a complete 360.<BR><B>Comments:</B><BR>  	We have the same basic structure and it goes straight when we push it but when we wind it up it goes in circles.  Today (because of the snow day this week) we only had one period to work on the car so we redid the iolets and cut new axels in case that was the reason it was going crooked and spinning about.  But we didn't have time to check it in the hallway.<P>  <FONT SIZE=2><B>JANUARY 5</B></FONT><BR><BR><B>Performance:</B><BR>  	Again, unfortunately our car moved about a foot and a half and did a 360.  If there was a contest for the most revolutions we would definately win.<BR><B>Comments:</B><BR>  	Today we took a different approach.  We measured the underneath to make sure it was equal - it was.  We opened the front iolets enough to put a straw in between and put the axel in the straw.  that seemed to get more power in the car.  It still turns, but we think that has something to do with the string - it gets caught and doesn't unravel from the back axel all the way.  So we cut it and will test it next time.  I hope it works!!!<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>JANUARY 12</B></FONT><BR><BR><B>Comments:</B><BR>  	Well, we abandoned all our ideas of our original car and expanded the cart so maybe now it will work!  We expanded the base of the car by putting wood along the side of the mousetrap.  We had to rubbar band a piece of metal on the bottom to give the back of the car some weight.  So far it works!  Not very well --but it it's better than the first one.  It moves down the hall (curves a little) but it moves!!!  It goes about 120 up the hill which is a much better accomplishÐment than our first car!<P><B>JANUARY 17</B><BR><BR><B>Performance:</B><BR>  Speed = 2.44 m/s<BR> Distance = 11.5 m<BR>Hill Climb = 150<BR>Tractor Pull = 20 g<BR><BR><B>Comments:</B><BR>  	It finally works!  And it works pretty well.  Since we extended the axel it gave the car the extra momentum / (and weight) to move.  It travels (at it's best) 11.5m down the hallway.  Also to help the performance of the car we attached 3 rubbar bands (rather than one) to the back wheels for the extra weight in the back.  We also cut straws to attach to the wheels so they could be somewhat stabalized.  I'm so happy it finally works!<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>JANUARY 19</B></FONT><BR><BR><B>Performance:</B><BR>  Speed = 2.8 m/s<BR>Distance = 15 m<BR>Hill Climb = 210<BR>Tractor Pull = 110 g<BR><BR><B>Comments:</B><BR>  	After a long journey, our car finally works.  And it works very well I might add!  When we first tested our car it was not working as well as it did the week before and we couldn't quite figure out why.  Then we found out "secret" the graphite lubricant.  From going 8 m in the hallway it went to 10 then 11.5 then 12 then 15!!  After a "lube job" it went over the top in the hill climb!  We also figured out the best way to place the weights on the tractor pull to pull at least 110g.<P>  <B>Mousetrap car finals:</B><BR><B>SPEED</B><BR>Trial 1  1.45<BR>Trial 2  1.92<BR>Trial 3  1.70<BR><BR><B>DISTANCE</B><BR>Trial 1  17<BR>Trial 2 _______<BR>Trial 3 _______<BR><BR><B>HILL</B><BR>Trial 1  235<BR>Trial 2  264<BR>Trial 3  284<BR><BR><B>TRACTOR PULL</B><BR>Best full pull  130 g<BR><hr><br><a href="dist.gif"><IMG SRC="distt.gif"></a> <a href="speed.gif"><IMG SRC="speedt.gif"></a> <a href="incline.gif"><IMG SRC="inclinet.gif"></a> <a href="trctrpl.gif"><IMG SRC="trctrplt.gif"></a><br><b>Click on thumbnail pictures to view full-size student diagrams and photographs of the performance.</b><hr></BODY> </HTML> </BODY> </HTML>

These points, plus any points Regents students receive for a second alternative project on solar energy (a possible 7), make for a possible total of 20 points --the same number of points receivable on Part II of the Regents exam, which these two projects replace. For Regents students, the evaluation components of the Mousetrap Car Project include the log each student keeps over the course of the project; the actual car built; its performance at the competition; the two related labs; and the oral presentation.

It's a very concrete progress that they can measure. Students aren't keeping in mind whether or not they were being innovative in order to get a higher number of points, but rather did what it took to make a winning car.<BR>	"We thought this project would be a lot of fun, but we were right there with the content as it was obvious how it connected to the material.  It was more a matter of figuring out where and how to bring it in."</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Scott: </B><BR><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE>"Generally, an 'A' student does well [on this project], but sometimes different learning styles are accommodated and a non-test taker does better. And this project has a good completion rate for all types of students. Kids enjoy it.<BR>	"I've gotten calls from parents [asking],'What is this crazy project?' as their son is up all hours with his partner racing cars in the basement. But they love it. When the project has been explained to them, they've always been very supportive."</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Jim:</B><BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE>"I'd like to eventually have students tell me on video tape what they did that day on their car during a double period and keep track of their progress that way. Then I could go back during my evaluation of each student and see what they'd been doing. Also, it would give some more individualized attention to the groups and give them needed feedback.<BR>  	"Hands-on assessment allows students who don't do as well in other formats to shine.<BR>	"We really build a work ethic -- if you apply, you can do it. [This is] an important element in raising self-esteem. The success of the cars is independent of the intelligence of the student and dependent upon a number of other factors like how willing are they to do the work, and independent of gender. It does depend to some degree on parental support or enthusiasm."<BR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>	Jim Gibson explained that the best way so far for him to evaluate a student's project was the videotaped class presentation. "In order to get a good look at the cars on tape I had each group show me and the camera all the angles on the car. In a couple of cases where the kids just said, 'We did this, we did that,' when I walked up to film the car, I asked, 'What else did you do that didn't work?' And they began to talk more about the problem-solving they did and what their understanding was behind why certain things did or didn't work.  It was exciting to hear. Plus the class got a good, close-up re-lecture on the ideas from each other's presentations."<P><HR WIDTH=75%> <B>STUDENTS</B><p><B>Mark:</B><BLOCKQUOTE> "[These kind of projects]  are a new level of applying the knowledge we learn to real life. You learn that there's more to research than what you put on paper. You have to try it out.  Hands-on projects are more complicated, 'cause you bring all you've been learning together."</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Tony:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>"When you see the rubric for these kinds of projects, you know what you have to do to get each level, otherwise you're guessing.  The rubric gives you a breakdown of what is being expected, and you can see more clearly where to focus.  You really already know how you'll be graded and then you can improve if you need or want to.<P>	"I like to be different and Chris and I were able to make something our own with the mousetrap car. We wanted to improve our own design not just someone else's.<BR>	"Along with the other goals of the project, working in teams teaches responsibility not only to the project but to the other team members --skills for how to work together and be productÐive. It's more realistic to have a partner; engineers/scientists don't work alone. These days work is more with teams and less [with] supervisors. It's better to learn how to work with others at an earlier age. In a partnership you are introduced to critiques and seeing things you might not have seen before. You could stumble on an idea you would have missed otherwise.<BR> 	"I like the competition, it's good natured competition, and [I like] how everyone's thinking compares. People shared what they wanted to but didn't give away big ideas.<BR>	"The logs helped keep us in touch with what was working or wasn't working from the last time so you could keep going or change something. Mr. Spacie wanted to see what we knew.  Sometimes he showed us some basic layout and design to save us some research time, but basically he wanted us to figure out how to make it work on our own."<P></BLOCKQUOTE><B>Chris:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  "In the real world, you are putting theories to work --way beyond studying formulas --proving to yourself that the theory and formulas do work.  Being able to know information is one thing; being able to use it is another. Putting the time into the project was worth it because you kept changing and coming up with new ideas. On a 40-minute test you don't get to use your mind and you don't want to study just using books and reading. It's boring.<P> 	"It's important to make sure students are given space and time for trial-and-error on their own. Give enough time for them to figure it out without telling them. Class time was an importÐant time to do work, especially with your partner. Some of the other work we did in class related to the project, but not all, and we were able to keep it separate."<P></BLOCKQUOTE><B>Charlie:</B><BLOCKQUOTE> "There's more of a connection to a project like the mousetrap cars because we spent so much time on it.  A project is more involved than just taking a test or doing a lab. In those you know just what to do; with this project you had to really think. I trust in the teachers that the amount of time left for the other areas is adequate."<P></BLOCKQUOTE>  <B>Samantha:</B><BLOCKQUOTE> "I think these projects are great. They allow for each student to excel in whatever area they are more successful in. Some students are not good test takers, while others are not very creative. In this manner, each student gets a fair chance to score higher!"<P></BLOCKQUOTE> <B>Revathi:</B><BLOCKQUOTE> "These projects made us think more, unlike regular problems where we just use equations.  It had us use common sense and physics."<P></BLOCKQUOTE><B>Thomas:</B><BLOCKQUOTE> "I think I would have learned more from the mousetrap car project had more laws of physics been demonstrated to us.  I used a lot of physical laws in my car, of course, but I wasn't really taught what was going on. The shelter [solar energy] project had a lot of math and was a good way to learn. The mousetrap car project may need more criteria in terms of using more math and formulas for a written report (i.e. PE, KE, Friction, loss of mechanical energy, etc.)."<P></BLOCKQUOTE><HR WIDTH=75%><B>Science Director</B><P>Scott McMullen:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"We hope to have students choosing science courses based on career path rather than tracking based on ability. I think the assessment changes are important to this, because they change the structure so that it is more hands-on, that it is more 'minds-on', that it promotes cooperative learning --all skills that will be useful in a variety of careers --real-world skills."<P>	"The assessment changes enable some students who were poor traditional test takers to take these courses and demonstrate their knowledge in alternative ways. For example, I can think of two students in particular who did very well on their projects in Regents Physics their first year we did this. And based on the grade they received, they passed the Regents, because of their project work, whereas they might have failed if it was only left to multiple choice. This project creates the ability for students to work together in 'new groups', I'll call it, and gives somebody a chance to be a significant member of a group, whereas in the old-fashioned way [of doing work] they wouldn't be. The kid who is a model-builder or a real innovative thinker suddenly becomes valuable not because he/she is an 'A' student, but because she has an ability to see things, maybe even something as simple as three dimensionally, and can visualize things. Surprisingly, there has not been protesting [from] students who perform well on traditional testing. Everybody seems to have found some value or even some enjoyment in this process.<P>   	"It may be at that level of gut understanding rather than paper-and-pencil, but they're getting the idea of, for example, the bigger wheel diameter producing distance, and the small diameter giving speed. They are getting that concept in a very intuitive way rather than spelling it out on paper and maybe not even understand it or know what it is.  The labs are different from traditional labs in that most labs are just a data-gathering experience; there is no creativity. They are a demonstration; there is one particular thing you want to see.  If you are doing a hook-and-spring law test, you hook up the spring, you measure the data, you learn about the concept, but you are not discovering; it is not inquiry-based. You are not learning something intuitively or otherwise. We still do the labs and other traditional components in the course. The alternative assessment option admittedly has impacted on instruction, because it has afforded teachers the chance to do some limited modifying of the Regents syllabus to make room for the changes in assessment, which take longer.  But, although there is a little less of the traditional instruction now, students in Regents Physics are still amply being prepared for Parts I and III of the Regents. <P>  	"Certainly, this form of assessment is more demanding on teachers. That's why they need support."<P></BLOCKQUOTE>For more information, please contact:<BR>Scott Spacie<BR>Mineola High School<BR>10 Armstrong Rd.<BR>Garden City Park, NY  11040-5299<BR></BODY> </HTML>

Several of the staff members come from other progressive, alternative high schools in New York City such as University Heights High School, Central Park East Secondary School, and City-as-School; other experienced teachers come from the city's comprehensive high schools.<P>		According to the school's graduation requirements, "The fundamental aim of Hamer High School is to teach students to use their minds well and prepare them to live productive, socially useful, and personally satisfying lives." Accordingly, "The school's academic program stresses intellectual development and political/social involvement in our society. Five 'habits of mind' are stressed: <P><OL><LI> helping students to learn to critically examine evidence; <BR><LI> to be able to see the world through multiple viewpoints -- to step into other shoes;<BR> <LI> to make connections and see patterns; <BR><LI> to imagine alternatives (what if? and else?);<BR> <LI> to ask, 'What difference does it make?  Who cares?'"<P>	As part of the school's development of an assessment process, students are evaluated on two Language Portfolios each year in the 9th and 10th grades. Language Portfolio work can be done in either English or Spanish. Rick Levine, one of the Humanities teachers, explains that the staff chose to focus on language because of the importance of "helping students become articulate and expressive people able to be understood by others and able to actively engage in persuading others about their ideas."<P>	FLHFHS is a newly developing school with a large bilingual population. Its teachers hope that the Language Portfolio evaluation process will help them focus on literacy, determine schoolwide standards, and critically examine staff discussions about what is valuable in terms of student work. Each teacher must read and respond to at least six Language Portfolios, all of which are regularly discussed at faculty meetings.<P>	One goal of the Language Portfolio is to help establish a portfolio culture throughout the school. A second goal is to introduce students to certain skills and habits of mind that will help them build graduation portfolios. The Language Portfolio system will continue to be revised as the staff clarifies its goals and practices. <P>  </BODY> </HTML>

It is a member of the Center for Collaborative Education - an organization currently in the process of replacing Monroe High School, a large urban high school on the Schools Under Regents Review (SURR) list - as well as of the Bronx/CPES Network. <P> 	Fannie Lou Hamer has an emphasis on community involvement. The environment at the school is familial and respectful of staff and students. Students are given individual attention and provided with diverse student-centered educational opportunities.	<P>	Teachers at FLHFHS are very much the creators and planners of the school, as well as the implementors of their ideas. The school is divided into two houses, each with 80 students and four teachers. The teachers are responsible for developing study units in the primary content areas of Humanities and Math/Science, but have support from non-teaching staff members, including a social worker, resource room teacher and paraprofessional. Teachers also enlist one another's help and work together, usually by subject area, to develop units. All liberal arts and sciences courses are integrated into the two interdisciplinary subject areas of Humanities and Math/Science, both of which are taught in daily two-hour blocks. In addition, each morning students take a two-hour block of Spanish, which is taught by an adjunct staff member. <P>	Classes at FLHFHS are heterogeneous and include special education students - for most activities - and a large group of Limited English Proficiency students. Currently, only the school's Division I program, for students in the ninth and tenth grades, is in effect. A Division II program is slated for implementation in 1996, and will consist of a course of study geared towards preparing 11th- and 12th-grade students (who will also be grouped heterogeneously) to complete graduation portfolios. Soon, Fannie Lou Hamer will be a complete four-year high school of no more than 400 students total. <P>	The Language Portfolios represent a two-year process which allows teachers and students to: 1) examine student literacy skills in the ninth grade; and 2) evaluate those skills in the tenth grade, based upon the Habits of Mind (see <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="vision.HTM">VISION</A>). A satisfactory Portfolio (a minimum of 14 points out of a possible 20) is necessary for progression to Division II.	<P>	In developing a new school, the teachers who designed the Language Portfolio decided to focus on "building a portfolio culture in the lower grades." Because the school has portfolio requirements for graduation, preparing students for this system has been essential. Developmentally, students consider the Language Portfolios to be central to their experience at Fannie Lou Hamer.  <P><B>THE LANGUAGE PORTFOLIO</B><P>The Language Portfolio is a 2-year long process. In the ninth grade, Portfolios are reviewed in January and May. In tenth grade, students assemble their Language Portfolios in January. They then have the whole schoool year to improve upon, revise, or otherwise change Portfolio work in order to meet established Benchmark Standards (see "Conferences and Portfolio Defenses" in CONTEXT). A student can select work completed over the course of either semester for inclusion in the Language Portfolio - a culminating collection of work which is evaluated by the student him- or herself and one or more teachers.  <P>	Language Portfolio pieces are selected to fit certain categories of language development: writing, reading, and speaking. Throughout each semester, students engage in work-related Exhibitions, which they draw upon when compiling their Portfolios. Students write a cover letter reflecting on the work included in their Language Portfolios. Every staff member at FLHFHS reads a number of Portfolios and writes a response letter to the student about his or her work and reflections. 9th-grade students receive a response letter from a teacher who has reviewed their work, but 9th-grade Language Portfolios are not given an overall grade. 10th-grade Portfolios, on the other hand, are graded; by the 10th grade, a satisfactory Language Portfolio and oral presentation of this Portfolio are required for entry to Division II. <P>  <B>CONSTRUCTING THE PORTFOLIO</B><BR>Students are given the guidelines sheet explaining the Language Portfolio at the beginning of the year (see PROMPT). In addition, teachers and advisors break down the portfolio process into components, which are then taught one at a time. For example, a teacher may have the whole class focus on which pieces to include for the writing section and how to reflect upon written work.  In this way, teachers are able to explain more deeply and concretely - through modeling - what is expected of each student, and can provide focused time for some students to catch up (some students will be ready to select pieces and revise them while others are still creating new work to go into their Language Portfolios.) Teachers at Fannie Lou Hamer are aware that many students have experienced failure in their previous educational settings. They reiterate the requirements for the Language Portfolio in class, and 10th graders provide peer instruction to the 9th graders, who are new to the portfolio process. The entry slips (see below) help students reflect on the work that they have done by asking specific questions about each piece included in the Language Portfolio, and provide a measure of organizing structure and reinforcement towards the portfolio process. <P><B>WRITING ENTRY SLIP:</B><P><OL><LI>  How you wrote it.<BR><LI>  Why you chose it.<BR><LI>  What important thing (or things) this shows about your writing.<P></OL><P><B>PUBLIC SPEAKING ENTRY SLIP:</B><BR><OL> <LI>  Describe the occasion.<BR><LI> Describe how you prepared for it.<BR><LI>  Describe what you learned about public speaking.<BR><LI>  Include any grades or comments or evaluation.</OL><P>	The Book Review Form asks for specific information about each book a student has read. Students are required to describe elements such as the setting, main characters, story conflict or problem, and the author's writing style. They are also required to give a brief recommendation for the book if they liked it, or, if they did not, to explain why this is so. <P>	Students work on their Language Portfolios during Humanities and Advisory periods. The checklist of required components lends structure to their work. Portfolio pocket folders are stored in accessible closets or cabinets, so students can get them on their own. Computer disks are kept in a separate file cabinet drawer and are used for finalizing and saving students' work throughout the year.  <P>	 A typical classroom scenario: Each student at a table has chosen something different from the others to include in his or her Language Portfolio. David has written a math/science piece, one student reads a classmate's poem, and Jarvin reflects on his oral presentation. Several students are at the computers working on cover letters.  The teacher, Rick, moves around the room, explaining what needs to be included and helping students figure out which pieces can be used for which category. "For the ninth graders," he says, "the first go around requires more pulling than any portfolio afterwards ... it's a retraining of how to think about one's work."<P>  	Nancy Mann, a Humanities teacher, goes over with her class the importance of writing cover letters - in which students reflect upon their work and progress - that are consistent with the pieces of work included in the Language Portfolio. She also posts deadlines on a white board in her classroom for the various parts of the Portfolio (for example, when the cover letter draft is due).<P> 	Each staff member at FLHFHS, including non-teachers, leads an advisory group of about 15 students. Groups will be mixed-age within each Division (i.e., ninth and tenth graders together; eleventh and twelfth graders together). Advisors will stay with the same group for two years. For teachers, advisees come from their own subject classes. Advisories meet four times a week for thrity minutes to an hour. Once a month, advisory groups meet for 11/2 hours to work on Portfolios (see below).<P>	Students are introduced to the portfolio process by their advisors, and initially work on their Language Portfolios once a month during Advisory periods. Work on January Language Portfolios shifts to Humanities class, where the teachers devote a concentrated amount of time towards helping students reflect on and assemble their Portfolio work. Work on May Portfolios is once again carried out in Advisory. Second-semester work time is especially important for tenth-grade students, who are preparing to deliver oral presentations of their Language Portfolios. <P>	Tenth-grade students who completed Language Portfolios as freshmen are often used as resources by other students. Several tenth-graders keep their last year's Language Portfolio with them. One tenth-grader, Marcha, comments, "Looking back to last year's portfolio is helpful." For their part, many ninth-grade students comment that this process is new to them, and very different from anything they'd done in Junior High School.<P><B>HUMANITIES CURRICULUM</B><P>Rick's interage 9th/10th-grade classroom greets those who enter with colorful bulletin boards, upon which pieces of student work from throughout the semester are displayed. Earlier in the year, students worked in teams to design posters for exhibitions about international rights issues. Teams chose to investigate one of several issues related to freedom: women's rights; ethnic diversity; land distribution; or colonialism and independence in China and Guatemala. Students learned about topics they didn't choose from their classmates' presentations, which everyone in the class was required to take notes on and respond to. <P>	As part of the Freedom Unit, students participate in reading workshops where they read Rigoberta Menchu's autobiography in English or Spanish and examine the issues of freedom raised by her life. As a follow-up, students write a letter to the author about parts of her story that touch them, or learn about another Guatemalan freedom fighter through Amnesty Inter-national and write to a Guatemalan official about the human rights issues pertinent to the case. These letters are regarded as writing samples; as such, they require several drafts and are often included in Language Portfolios as process pieces. <P>	In other parts of the Humanities curriculum, two classes of students work on original poetry with a Poet-in-Residence sponsored by Americorps. This past year, Sandra Maria Esteves came to FLHFHS three times each week to conduct an hour-long poetry workshop. Students engage with this form of expressive writing, and poems can be included in Language Portfolios under the categories of "Your Choice" or "Process Piece."<P>  	A second literature component of the Humanities curriculum for Semester I of this year  involves students reading MacBeth as a whole class, taking turns reading parts, and analyzing the play together. In addition, a production of the play is put on, for which each classroom acts out one scene. The work from this unit on MacBeth can be included in Language Portfolios reviewed at the end of Semester II as examples of either writing, reading, or public speaking.<P><B>CONFERENCES AND PORTFOLIO DEFENSES (10th Grade)</B><P>Language Portfolios are discussed with parents at conferences. Parents come in and meet with their child and his or her advisor to review report cards, which are given out four times a year. 	When a tenth-grade student is ready to defend his or her final revised Language Portfolio, a Portfolio presentation meeting is held. The attendees include either a family member or person of the presenting student's choosing, along with two teachers and a 9th-grade student. These meetings are typically scheduled from the beginning of April to the end of the school year. Forms are used by each person at the Language Portfolio presentation meeting to assess the presenting 10th grade student. One form follows a rubric designed to evaluate the oral presentation of the student's Language Portfolio, while another represents an overall Language Portfolio score based upon the Habits of Mind rubric scoresheet (see <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="evaluate.HTM">EVALUATION</A>). <P>	Tenth-grade students must present a satisfactory Language Portfolio to qualify for entry to Division II. At a family "benckmark conference," the student's advisor meets with the student and a family representative to determine the student's readiness for Division II. If the student is not considered ready for Division II, the conference develops a plan for the student's continued work in Division I. The staff approves all plans and certifies the student's transition to Division II. <P>The Benchmark Standards considered in the conference are: <OL><LI>Language Portfolio;<LI> Final Exhibitions; <LI> two years of community service; <LI> Regents Competency Exams in math, reading, and writing; and <LI> two years of Spanish and the Spanish Proficiency Exam.</OL></BODY> </HTML>

It explains the Language Portfolio, listing the components students will need to include, and is kept in students' Language Portfolio folders. In addition, teachers make clear early in the school year that unlike the 9th-grade Portfolios, 10th-grade Language Portfolios will be evaluated, and  that sophmores' promotion from Division I (9th and 10th grades) to Division II (11th and 12th grades) is dependent on their creation of a satisfactory Language Portfolio grade (at least 14 points out of a possible 20).

I write more In my work then I used to when I have to do assingment I get in detail And describe How I did it, And How I got this, and that. How this fit's with that, that fit's with this.  I show where I get my Answers And How to prove there right.  Before I just used to right the Answer And that was that; I thought I was finished.  But Now I get into detail And know take my time.  I think I improved there Alot.<P>	In Ready I improved Alot Because I read more Books this semester that last year In the 8th grade.  Since school stared I Read a total of 9 Books.  Last year I used to pretend I Read Books.  I think I only Read If the Book is About topics you deal with in every day life.  I like to read about things that Are Real, about people stories.<P>	In speaking I think I kneed alot of Improving In this subject.  In the class descussion I Need to participate More speak My Mine and Read out loud.  But also I think I do well In presentations. I say what I have to say, And I just get my things done. Like when we did the poem "fire, fire" I said My part nice and loud without Any problems.  But I think I still Need to do More in this subject.<P><B>Public Speaking Reflection</B><P><BR>June 9, 1995<P><BR>In our class we had to do a year long exhibition on teenage pregnancy.  Then when we were finished we had to do a video on what we learned and did during this time.  One of the thing that are in the video were a piece of taping that we did when we went to a place called Child Birthing Center.  We went there to find out a little about teenage pregnancy , one of the thing that we asked them was who do you see more , teenagers or adults and there answer was teenagers.  On that visit we taped it and put some clips of that tape in our video.<P>	Then after that visit we went to a place called Planed Parenthood.  We learned things about how if you are a teenager you should not have a baby because that will effect a teenagers body because they are not fully developed.  Also that if you are pregnant you should not smoke or drink because it will affect the baby.  In that visit we also video taped it and used pieces of that in our video.  <P>	Then we went to the board of education and there we saw Dr. Luis Reys.  Then we talked about what the board of education is trying to do about this situation.  Also from that visit we took a piece of that tape and put it into our video.<P>	The role I played in this was that I was one of the narrator in the video.  I introduced some parts of the videos interviews. I had two to three parts. <P> 	The way I prepared for this was before I went on camera I rehearsed my lines a few times and I got a little of what I had to say , but I still was not sure of what I had to say so I had cu-cards put in front of the camera so when I got on camera I had my lines in front of me.<P>	I learned a lot about public speaking , I learned that if focus on what you are going to say it comes out very good.  It did because even though I had the cu-cards in front of me it looked like I had the lines in my memory. I also know that if you concentrate on what you are doing everything around me is totally out of my mind.<P>	For this project I still don't know what my grade is.<P>	The reason I picked this for my public speaking piece is because I had fun doing this project . At first I thought that it was going to be boring but then I began to realize that if you put your mind to it, you will have fun.<P><B>Teenage Pregnancy Piece (Excerpt)</B><P><BR>May 25, 1995 <P><BR>I think that the government should cut of the benefit for welfare for teenagers to have an abortion.  So the only way the could pay for an abortion is with cash.  And that they can raise the cost for the abortion .  Also that when the teenagers going to get an abortion they have to bring two parents or two legal guardians with proof that they are who they say they are .<P>	The way I would do this is go to the place where they deal with this .  I would go to abortion clinics and right a proposal to change the ways that woman pay for abortions .  And the parental consents for teenagers . I would explain how abortions are injustice and why should they lessen to what I have to say .  Also why my class chose that topic and why it is an important topic .  <P>	Then I would go to the state government so that they can take out the money the welfare is giving these teens to get an abortion.  Also they can take out or make it a law that to get an abortion you have to be living in New York state for at least 6 to 8 months .  So that when teenagers or any other woman decide to get an abortion , and cannot get one where there living cause it's illegal they'll have to show that they have been living here for over that period of time.<P><B>Child Abuse (Process Piece - 1st draft)</B><P><BR>November 29, 1994<P><BR>alot of times I see people walking with there kids and the parents get drunk and start hiting there kids for know reason.  I know this girl that her mother drinks and her father uses drugs and when they fight the father takes it out on the daughter and he be hitting like if her's tring to kill her.  every time her father hits her, she ether runs away or ends ups ant the hospital with a badly bruised face and black and blues all over her body.  One time to get back at her father she got pregnant and when her father found out they started fighting and he pushed her down the stairs and she lost her baby, and he put her in a home and ever since that the mother left and I never seen that family again except for the girl now she lives with this family the foster care found for her.<P>	Another time I was standing in front of my building with my friends and this lady with her son was passing by (and he was like 4) and he triped on something and his mother started beating him up in front of us just cause he triped.<P><B>One Day A Long Time Ago</B> (Poem - Final draft<P>)<BR>One day a long time ago<BR>	I was sitting<BR>as a woman passed <BR>	Her child tripped and fell.<BR>	She did not care<BR>who was there.<BR>She grabbed him by the arm<BR>	She Hit and Hitt<BR>till she could Not hit No more.<BR>	She finally realized<BR>	She wasn't alone<BR>All she said was<BR>	"Well"<BR>Just cause he tripped and fell.<P><HR WIDTH=65%><B>Poetry Reflection</B><P><BR>February 7, 1995<P><BR>We had to do a poem for poetry class.  So I wrote a poem Based on the project we're doing in Humanities class about child abuse so we had to hand in a paper on why we chosse that topic and I told A storie in that piece.  So with that story I put it in to a poem.  In that poem I put actions that happend and some of my feeling together and I came up with a moving poem called "One day a long time ago."<P>	I chosse this poem because I like the Idea that i came up with a  poem out of a piece of paper, I thought just was work from another class.  And I think I made alot of progress.  I think I put alot of effort into this work.   An important thing that I think shows is that I did some it thing that I never thought I would ever do.  I thought I was very proud of myself. <P><B>Train Proposal</B> (Excerpt)<P><BR>Math & Science<P><BR>June 1, 1995<P><BR>I'm writing a proposal for a train line that I'm building.  It runs through the North part of the Bronx.  It runs close to the shopping areas and the parks .  Where my train runs there are no other train lines running that way.  At a certain point my train connects with trains 2 & 5. I'm going to be charging the people $ 1.00 for their ride.  For my train, I'm going to be spending $ 25,319,320.00.  I'm going to have 34 stops. I have my train running for 23.2 miles in 17.3 minutes.  My train starts at W. 262 St. to Chaffee St.  3,750 people will be riding my train per day, and 1,368,750 will be riding my train per year . <P>	The first thing that I had to do was to find out where my train line was, then I had to take a small map of the Bronx and find the real train lines, shopping malls and the parks , then put my train line.  After that I got a bigger pieces of paper and I had to put the shopping areas and parks and my train line on it by scale [2x the size]. The way I got that was the paper was  a size smaller then I had to multiply that number by 2 then I got my answer.  Then I had to present it and I got feed back from two other students and a teacher then I picked the train line that I thought got the most feedback and the best feedback .  Which was the second one train {x}.<P>	I got 6 pieces of paper, on the papers there was the map of the Bronx enlarged and I had to put them together then I had to draw my train line on that map.  I had to make sure that my train line did not cross over any other blocks, I had to make sure that the line was on the streets and on it's right path .  After I put down the line I had to measure the distance between the stations . I had to do this by scale.  My scale was 2cm = 1,421 ft. The way I got this was at the bottom of the map there was a scale that was in feet so I had to put it into cm .  Next I had to change them into miles, my miles were 23.2.  The way I did this was I had to take all my feet and divided them by 5,280 . That number came from how many feet are in a mile. Next I had to change them into kilometers, my kilometers were 37,352.  The way I got that was I had to multiply my miles by 1.61 km.  That was how I got my kilometers.  <P>	Next I had to do my construction budget, on how much I was going to spend on my the two sets of tracks , on my power system , communication and signal system.  The way that I got my cost for how much I'm going to pay for my train cars was, each cart was $825,000.  So I had to times that by 26 [because I got two trains and they got 13 cars each so that how I got 26] so my answer was $ 21,450,000.  From what I got from the other things and this I added it all up and this is what I got $ 495,068,583.4.<P>	From the $ 2.billion that I got I subtracted $ 495068583.4 and I got $ 1.5 billion left.  Then I had to do my operating budget, I had to find out how much I was going to spend on the people who are going to be running my trains and the people who are going to be running the token booths.  For example the people who are going to be running the token booths are going to get paid $24 per hour so I need 3 people to be running it, and they are working 8 hours a day. So I took    $ 24 x 3 = 72     72 x 8 = 576     576 x 34 = 19,584 .     I multiplied 576 by 34 because that's how many stations I have. Then I had to see how much I was going to spend a year on this so I mutipled 19,584 by 365 be cause that is how many days in year and then I my answer. Then I had to find out how fast my train was running and how many people are going to be riding my train per day which was 3,750 and per year was 1,368.750.  The way I got this was I times 145 because that is how many people is going to be in one cart, so I times that by 13 because that is how many cars I got. Then I took that number and times it by 2 because I got two sets of trains .  Then that was how I got my number for how many people are going to be ridding my train per day .  then I took that number and times it by 365 cause thats how many days in one year .  Then thats how I got my answer for how many people are going to be riding my train per year . <P><HR WIDTH=65%><B>10th-Grade Language Portfolio:</B><P><BR>Cover Letter (Final draft)<P><BR>January 18, 1996<P><BR>I have read 5 books in the semester and a half of this school year. The books that I read were:<BR>Disappearing Acts by Terry McMillan, Palante, Rigoberta Menchu by Rigoberta Menchu, Assata by Assata Shakur, and MAKES ME WANNA HOLLAR by Nathan MacCall. The books that interest me the most are books that I can relate to in life  such as relationships, friendships, family problems and things that happen now a days. I like books about things that I see every day, I also like books that talk about people who were in the young lords, and in the black panther party. I like to know why and how they joined. What happened when they were in there, and how them joining the group changed there lives. I also like mysteries, but I have not read one yet. The progress that I made from last portfolio was that yes I read more books, but I also read all kind of books. Also last year I used to read book that kids in J.H.S. read, now I read books that are more on the level where I'm suppose to be at.<P>	In speaking the progress that I made was, I've over come my fear of talking in front people. Also that I like the way I can use words to express myself clearly. I like the way that I can do a presentation and have myself ready for it so that I can speak clearly and get my point across. <P>	In my writing I am improving. I think it is because of my increased reading. I am now able to write about many topics, and a lot of times my final draft makes me happy. If I find something that I enjoy and I have to write  something about it I'll be able to come up with something that I think will be very good I'll be very proud of.<P>	What I need improvement on, in reading is, I'm still not yet satisfied with the amount of books that I read this year. I still have to read a lot more and pick up my reading pace.<P>	In speaking I have to slow down so that I won't rush and then nobody won't hear what I have to say.<P>	In writing I have to take my time so that I will be able to understand what is it that I want to say. I also have to proof read my work so that there won't be a lot of mistakes.<P>	The only two goals that I have for next year is to read at least 10 books for the whole school term. Then to have already completed 4 of my 7 graduating portfolios. <P><B>Math/Science Reflection: Sexually Transmitted Diseases</B><P> <BR>March 27, 1996<P><BR>The piece that I have chosen to include in my portfolio was a proposal I had to write for a Sexually Transmitted Disease project I was doing in my math/science class.<P>	For me to be able to write my proposal I had to know a little about Sexually Transmitted Diseases (S.T.D's) such as the cures for them, how we contract them and how to avoid, getting them. I was required to find out how many people in my community had S.T.D's and what age group were mostly contracting them. I also had to know which S.T.D's were most common.<P> 	In my proposal I wrote that I wanted to open a center in my community where people who have the diseases can go. They can go there for help and for counseling. Or if they need some advice on where to go if they need second opinions to any questions that they might have about S.T.D.'s. We can teach kids to say no when their partner does not want to wear a condom. I showed how the numbers of people contracting S.T.D's increased and decrease through different years and with different diseases in a graph that I made.<P>	The reason I chose this piece is because it is the best work that I have done in my math class since the beginning of the school year. It is really the only thing that I got a very good grade on. Also I liked doing this project because I learned new things that I did not know about S.T.D's. This was the first exhibition I had to do this year and I felt that I put a lot of effort in to it.<P>	What I like about my writing is the way I started the proposal. I also liked the way I described what I wanted to do for my community. What impressed me was how I was clear about what I wanted and what I was going to do for my community once I got the money that the city granted me. <P>          In my proposal I included information that I thought was true. I was reading an article and I thought it said that:  In my community there are about 3,000 youths. Of that amount 80% of them will or have already contracted an S.T.D. Then I found out that I was reading it wrong. With that information I put that:  80% of all S.T.D's occur amoung persons 15-19 years of age. When I wrote this I  thought it made perfect sense. Then I showed it to one of my teachers and he made me realize that I was mixing two complete different things and making then seem the same. When he was explaning it to me I did not get it at first, then he gave me an example, I thought about what he said and them I realized what my mistake was. The example that he used was: If 99% of all bald people are men, is that the same as saying, 99% of all men are bald. I thought about it for a while then I said no because 99% of all men are not bald only a small portion of men are bald. But they do make up 99% of all bald people in general.  <P><P></P><B>Math & Science Proposal: Sexually Transmitted Diseases</B>(Excerpts)<P><BR>March 27, 1996<P><BR>Good morning ladies and gentlemen of today's City Council. I am here to propose that in my community we are in real need of a center where people can go to get information about the Sexually Transmitted Diseases that they have contracted or are at risk of catching. In the center we are going to try and stop the spread of S.T.D.'s. We will hand out pamphlets so that they can know and understand what the disease is and how it is affecting their body. We will also give them information on how their body is going to change and the way they are going to start acting differently towards people.  Also in the center we would like to  have counseling for  patients who want or need it. The center will run from nine in the morning to six at night. I also want to have  a doctors office so the doctor can explain the different things that can happen. For example the consequences if a woman who has S.T.D.'s gets pregnant. How a child might have the chance of being born with birth defects such as retardation. The child can also be born dead, or it can grow without certain body parts such as toes or fingers. Or it can grow with one too many fingers or toes. They also can go and get treated there depending on the disease they have been infected with.  For example if they  have crabs the doctor will give them a special shampoo, or for another type of S.T.D. they will give them antibiotics or the medicine that can cure or treat the symptoms if the disease can not be cured.  <P>     	Also in the center I would like to have parent involvement. I would like to provide classes for parents on learning how to talk to there children about the consequences of having unprotected sex. To learn how to have an understanding with their youths. Not only will I like to have parent involvement ,Id like to have community involvement. Since the center is in the community , and for the community.<P>      According to the Washington Times May 11,1993, article, The Danger Years: A Guide to Teen Health, 80% of all sexually-transmitted diseases occur among persons 15-19 years old. I am very much on top of this because I fall in this age group. Also many people that I know are within that age range and they are sexually active and that worries me. So I think that this center is a good idea because if they ever need a place to go to talk or need help the center will be there for them. Another good reason is because people will see that our center is a success  and pretty soon   we will have centers like this all around the United States.<P>        Attached is a bar graph showing the numbers and the diseases that people have. [See Appendix to view bar graph.] Chlamydia 4 million/ yearly, while herpes is running as high as 20 million, Gonorrhea  was at 677,000 in 1971,  but in 1985 it went higher to 884,563. Syphillis in 1985 was at 67,563 then it went higher to 86,545 in 1987. Also there is  Pelvic Inflammatory Disease at 1 million a year. <P>	So in conclusion I am asking the city to give me 3.5 million dollars to start the center and I would also like it if you can help me find a place to set up. I would like to thank all of you (the city council) for taking the time to hear my proposal. <P><B>"Your Choice" Piece Reflection</B><P><BR>April 1, 1996<P><BR> The piece that I have entered in my portfolio is my choice piece. It is a poem that I wrote in my poetry class. The teacher told us that we had to picture a place that we would love to be at, at that very same moment. She said that we had to describe what this place would look like, how would it smell and what I would be doing  there. She told us that we did not have to write it as if it were a poem. She said to write it as a little composition, then later on she would help us turn it into a poem. Then she told us for every sentence we had wrote, it would be something that we could imagine so that if some one were reading it they would be able to picture themselves there in that place.<P>	So I began to think of a place that I would like to be at . At that very same moment. The first thing that came to my mind was what I wrote. I wrote about a place that everybody would like to be when the weather is not that great. So of course my place is a beautiful island where the sun is shining and where there's nobody to interrupt me. I wrote the poem so that if someone was reading it they can see the things that I see , hear the things that I hear, smell the things that I smell, and feel the way I feel.<P>	The reason I chose this poem was because when I first showed my poem to the teacher she had a smile on her face. She told me that it was the best poem I wrote in that class. She said that she liked the words I used to describe the picture. Also because people were telling me that it was very good and they could imagine themselves there. When I heard that it made me feel good Knowing that people liked what I did. <P>	What this shows about my writing is that if I put effort into my work I cans come up with something that is really good and not just do the work so that I can say I'm done . I also see that I know how to put words down on paper and make them come alive in my imagination, and in other people's minds.<P><B>"Your Choice" Piece: Poem</B><P><BR> Laying on warm sand<BR>Hearing sounds of ocean<BR>Seeing the movement of waves<BR>Smelling scents of blue water<BR>Looking out to sea<BR>My eyes meet the end<BR>The horizon.<BR>Looking back To catch so many trees looking at me<BR>Discovering all the different scents of<BR>Coconut<BR>Mango<BR>Apple<BR>Just lying there<BR>Letting the bright sun<BR> Mark me  with it's rays<BR>While I'm lying there<BR>Smelling<BR>Looking<BR>Hearing<BR>I'm starting to wonder<BR>Who shall I share this with?</BODY> </HTML>

Not only have I learned more about you and your growing skills, but I have been encouraged to think through some issues involving all our students.  Thank you.  	Your poem, "One Day a Long Time Ago," is simple and beautiful. It expresses your outrage at this incident of abuse without preaching and because of that, it is most effective.  Now that you have discovered your poetry gift, I hope you will continue to use it. You have much that is important to say and poetry can be a very effective medium of expression.  Equally impressive is the thought which went into the poem and that is reflected in your writing entry slip. It is very important that we reflect thoughtfully on ourselves, our ideas, and our world. I hope you will continue to do this as well as you have in thinking about this poem.<P>  	Your excitement in learning is apparent both from your Math/Science entry and your comments on your Spanish mid-term.  I wonder why you also write that you do little in Spanish. It sounds as if your work on the economy of Venezuela was very helpful both in learning about this nation and in improving your skills in Spanish. I wish you had attacked the Venezuela paper as well. Did you do it in the Spanish language? It seems as if you enjoyed the Math/Science project greatly and learned a lot from it. It is often important to understand how much we are learning. <P> 	It was particularly important to see that you are reading more these days and enjoying what you are reading.  That is a key to your education and to a special joy in life.  I'm glad you're not just pretending to read anymore!  Now it would be helpful to see more reflection on what you read.  The two book reviews you have submitted are incomplete and lack much of the thought you have put into your other work.  You seem to have enjoyed El Bronx Remembered  and The Face on the Milk Carton, but that is hard to tell from what you have written.  You list characters, for example, but never describe any.  If anyone heard only your name - Jesselin - would they know very much about you?  You have not looked at these books with the kind of thought which will bring out a lot more about them and you.  I expect to see a lot more in your June language portfolio.<P>	It appears that your public speaking experiences was a good and valuable one, but, again, it would have been helpful to see what you said and to read any of the evaluations of your work.  How about getting someone to tape it next time?<P>	You are doing some wonderful work, Jesselin, but there is, as you know, some more work to do.

I was glad to read your portfolio today, especially since I don't get the chance to see you and your work on an everyday basis this year. You are making progress and your work is developing. Today I'm going to be "assessing" your work, based on an idea of what you will need to do in order to graduate. During the spring you will have to make a presentation of your work to a committee. The assessment is based on what we call "habits of mind."<P>	The first "habit" is Viewpoint. Can you take a point of view (opinion) and argue for it? Can you see and discuss the viewpoints of others? Your reading (Book reviews) shows that you can recognize and enter into different points of view. You can sympathize with Rigoberta's point of view. Your reflections show that you can state your own perspective on an issue. I do not yet see anything that shows you can discuss the viewpoints of others.<P>	The second habit is Connections. Does your work have coherence, or internal connections? Does your work show that you see the connections within a topic? and between any topic and the larger world around us? This is an area in which I think you have always been strong. Last year's portfolio showed that you were able to make the connection between the learning you were doing and the world around you. This year's portfolio continues to show that strength. The "Still I Rise" exhibition shows that you can connect things that you have learned around the common theme of freedom. You also make poetic connections by using the common refrain of "Still I Rise." Your writing generally has internal coherence (Meaning, your writing is logically organized). You also make connections between what happens and how you learn, and we can see this in all of your reflection pieces, especially the Panel Speech.<P>	The third thing is evidence. How do you know what you know? How do you know it is true? You use evidence in your reflection pieces, and your work itself is the evidence that what you say about your work is true (or at least reasonable.) You include some evidence in the form of statistics in your math-science piece but you don't actually use it. How would the number of STDs affect the decision of the city council? What do these numbers have to do with the Bronx? Where do they come from anyway?<P>	Voice has to do with the impact of your language. Can you use language to make the impression you want to make? You have developed a personal voice. Your reflections tell a story in a clear and straightforward way. Your math/science proposal is also clear and reasonable. Your poem shows the development of an emotional voice that can paint pictures in language. In your book review of Disappearing Acts you say "I love the way she brings her characters to life by using the language we use nowadays." We have to bring our work to life by using the language that we use. It is not always everyday language. For example, you still need to develop an academic voice, one that you can use to deal with viewpoint and evidence.<P>	And Conventions is our last concern. While your writing has improved over the last year and a half you still have many things to work on. You need to work on them until they become automatic, just the way you always do things. You need to work on proofreading. In your cover letter you want to say "now a days" but you say "know a days." You say "pick up my space" instead of "pick up the pace." You often write "where" when you mean "were," and "there" instead of "their." (Math-science piece). And in the two pages of work (Math-Science) there are 8 misspellings.

That FLHFHS represents a different experience from students' previous schooling  is evident in their comments about the Language Portfolio Project. Although students are being held accountable for quality work, the level of work produced often reflects their lack of school training. The comments below represent reflections from two Humanities teachers; reflections from students; and excerpts from a staff discussion about the process of evaluating 9th-grade Language Portfolios and assessment at Fannie Lou Hamer in general. <P> <B>TEACHERS</B><P><BR>According to teachers Rick and Nancy, and Peter, the school's co-director, the Language Portfolio facilitates development of a schoolwide process for discussing standards. The staff is currently discussing what to look for in student work and how students and teachers can build a culture that will lead to the realization of the graduation-by-portfolio plan. Nancy comments that children can't have changes sprung on them any more than adults can: "You can't just tell them about portfolios; they have to experience some kinds of portfolio assessment for themselves. So, the 9th and 10th grades are aimed at literacy portfolios to get them accustomed to having their work assessed by portfolio."<P>   	Rick believes that as a result of the Language Portfolio, students learn to reflect on their work quantitatively. "They have to ask themselves, 'Do I have the work to pull from or not?' Then students begin to want to have more stuff to choose from. It's the most elementary aspect, but from that context, more extensive goal setting can be determined. The qualitative reflection is there, but it varies from student to student. At this point, what constitutes good writing is very primitive. It goes beyond handwriting, but not much into voice and style.  <P> 	"What is very effective is that the value of one's own work increases through the practice of keeping things.  Work becomes not just another hoop to jump through, but something they are known by." Rick admits that what is less effective so far is the push for deep student self-reflection. However, his students do self-reflect: Rick was pleasantly surprised when a diligent, cooperative student diagnosed her problem with reading and expressed concern and a desire to work on it. <P> 		Rick also notes that a compelling reason not to use tests is that they are short-term and quickly over. "If you are not a successful student or don't see yourself as successful, you can pretend a test is not there - it may be painful and demeaning, but you can get it over with and distance yourself. You just don't have to think about a test as much.  It's harder to do that with portfolios." Many of the students at FLHFHS are coming from schools that were "more about babysitting than traditional or non-traditional teaching. The students are now just getting accustomed to the idea that in school you work."<P>		Nancy emphasizes that student assessment is based on student work, so students can't get away from doing it. "One can get a better sense of students' reading by observation and their work from portfolios than standardized, closed tests. Graduation will not be based on seat time or credits. The Language Portfolio helps students understand how to get out."<P> 	Nancy also mentions the importance of having teachers in all grades help establish the graduation process, and of helping students entering the 11th grade understand the school's graduation requirements, so that they get beyond "visualizing the graduation portfolio as a bigger Langauge Portfolio."<P><B>STAFF members</B><BR>[Excerpts from a January, 1996 discussion on how to assess 9th-grade Language Portfolios. On the next day, staff members discused 10th-grade Portfolios.]<P>	Discussions about assessment and the response letters to students occured before and after the staff began looking at students' Language Portfolios. Through these discussions, school-wide issues were raised with regard to alternative means of evaluating student work. Several staff members felt that last year's response letters to students were more encouraging than evaluative and too vague. Each teacher was given the opportunity to express his or her ideas about what should be included in a response to a student. The comments below represent some of the important issues raised: <P><B>Lyn:</B> "Last year, I left out things I thought would turn a student off.  I wanted to be encouraging. But I did leave out of the letter some of the comments that are in my notes.<P>	"I am going to strive for a better connection between my notes and my letter.  Last year was the first time I didn't have to just give letter grades.<P>	 "I was surprised by the impact last year - the letters proved very powerful."<P><B>Rick:</B>  "Your observations are not critical or negative, but rather concrete. The more specific you are, the more of a dialogue there is - an engagement between the reader and student.<P>	"Instead of starting out with a list of what's supposed to be there and take off for what is left out, focus on what the kid is doing. <P> 	"In the letters we write, let's try to draw them out, ask questions and try to find out who are these students as people.<P>	"My goal is to slow down, because you see what you expect to see and miss what you don't expect will be there.  My experience has been reading Regents exams where you are looking to see if the student answered the question correctly. Now I want to ask myself what am I missing or what is the student answering?"<P><B>Peter: </B> "It's important to be supportive, but we cannot patronize. Tell the students frankly with evidence what would be helpful and why. Think about the things we can work on in family conferences, not generalities. Need to be honest, supportive, and specific with evidence and treat the students in a more adult way."<P><B>Nancy: </B> "Bring to this task our role as adults - what do we see?  Really respond to them and what they did. I agree that the general aims should be honesty and specificity.<P>	"We do benefit from taking the time to do this - teachers coming to common ideas of good work.  What sense are we making of what students are doing?<P>	"They [the letters] are very personal and people are taking the time.<P>	"No steadfast rule on who you read. Though prior knowledge of students usually impacts on response letters.  Keep in mind that it is useful for teachers to get a sense of the whole school by looking at other teacher's work through the students."<P><B>Jose (social worker): </B> "This time I understand better how to use the note-taking grid for the evidence part.<P>	"I want to read the portfolios of students from my advisory."<P><B>Lisa:</B>  "These portfolios give us a clear idea of how students are progressing on an individual basis.  I can tell more from these portfolios than from the classroom how kids write and what to do in terms of pushing it forward."<P><B>Norma (Alternative Schools Bilingual Coordinator, invited visitor):</B> "Do kids get these notes you write?  I am advocating honest feedback but written in a loving way.  I will stress that this is an on-going process and that we are all developing.  I will tell the kids that I'm learning, too.  It's a thin, delicate balance."<P> <B>Sean:  </B>"I hope what's in the portfolios will inform my classroom practice."<P><B>Julio:</B> "I am going to find a way to suggest help and provide resources to the student, especially related to math/science."<P><B>Erika:</B>  "I will focus on what the work is really saying.<P>	"I don't want to read any of the students who I work with, too biased."<P><B>Nellie:</B>  "I am going to point to specific areas in the student work and how to get them to the goals I have in mind.  It's a process of how to be thorough and honest while not overwhelming the student."<P>  <B>Celia (Writing Center, Lehman College - invited visitor):</B> "How do we help kids move along?  Outside images sometimes work, like grades, good jobs, etc., but if not, what does?  Our work as adults help kids identify what their strengths and interests are. Our perspective as outsiders is not just to tell a kid what he/she can't do but what he/she can do and wants to do. Understanding their worldview and their energies and connecting with that is crucial. Also, paying attention to the connection between the evidence/notes grid and letter and instruction."<P> <HR WIDTH=65%>[After each adult read and responded to at least one Language Portfolio, the staff and visitors met to go over what different people had come up with and to hear the many possible ways of giving useful feedback to students.]  <P><B>Nellie:</B>  "How do we know if what the student is saying is truthful?  For example, how do we know if the kid actually made the speech or read five books.  And if a student is getting help from another student - is it their own?  Begs the question, when is it your own?"<P><B>Rick: </B> "This is a small enough school to catch such discrepancies, for the most part."<P><B>Nancy:</B>  "Eventually, we will expect kids to put in more photos, video, cassettes, etc. to document exhibitions and public speaking. We should encourage them to include more stuff to show they've done something.<P>	"How expandable are these small schools to meet the individual needs of students?"<P><B>Norma:</B> "Are we responding to students in their dominant language?  How do we deal with the learning of both languages?  What is the correct program for LEP kids with deficiencies in both languages?  This issue raises the limitations of schools.  This issue is a citywide one and high school admissions need to be more evaluative to make sure placements are more responsive."<P><B>STUDENTS</B><BR><B>Jesselin</B> (Reflecting after the 10th-grade portfolio process; Spring 1996):<BR>  <BLOCKQUOTE>"Doing portfolios are hard.  You need a lot of patience and to understand that when you get back pieces from teachers, they're not criticizing, but helping you improve. This year I have a better understanding of what I am doing which you have to have in order to elaborate and defend your work, not just answer yes or no.  The portfolio defense meeting was to see if I know what I'm doing.  I had to proove my work was worth what an 11th-grader should be doing. Like I was asked about a particular line in a poem I used in an exhibition - 'leaving behind nights of terror and fear I'll Rise' - did I understand what the poet meant? And I was able to explain her words because I had read other things by Maya Angelou and I had studied the history of when she was writing about, like the KKK and what they did.<P>  	"In a speech I made, I said something about different ethnic cultures and different ethnic music and my committee challenged me to connect what I'd said in my speech with another line in the poem, 'Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave.' So I talked about the connection between Maya Angelou's thought and the stories in El Bronx Remembered that discuss how in the Bronx ancestors gave music to us that we hear even now, you can see it all around here.<P>   	"In my presentation of my Portfolio I went straight to presenting the pieces that were strongest and how they connected to the habits of mind.  I worked much harder this year than last because then I just wanted to pass, but now when I only needed 3 more points to get a satisfactory, I wound up having a lot more - I wanted to do something to be proud of.<P>	"When I first did the Portfolio, I found out I could have added more and when I proofread, I saw the connections in the works. I used myself, teachers, and other students to help me figure out what I need to fix. I did that for my friends, writing comments. You could tell we cared about each other's work and we would go back and make corrections. The teacher gave ex-amples of what was confusing in my work and helped me clarify what I wanted to say. After I got my response letter from Nancy, I sat down with her and had a discussion about what to improve, especially my grammar, and how to show evidence. Then this second time around, I included where I got evidence for what I stated. When you study for a test, you can study hard, then the next day you don't remember anymore because you're just concerned with passing that test only. One of the projects I presented at my defense was from the beginning of the year and it was like I'd just done it. I had to write reflections on the work and show how other work related to that project.  It was something I was proud of."<P> </BLOCKQUOTE><B>For more information, please contact:</B><P><BR><P ALIGN=CENTER>Nancy Mann or Rick Levine<BR>Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School<BR>1021 Jennings Ave.<BR>Bronx, NY  10460<BR>e-mail: <!-- MailTo Tag --><A HREF="MAILTO:rmann@bway.net">rmann@bway.net</A> or <!-- MailTo Tag --><A HREF="MAILTO:rick_levine@cce.org">rick_levine@cce.org</A></P> </BODY> </HTML>

The changes in assessment that are starting to be implemented school-wide involve students in determining the criteria for different levels of quality in their own work. "Students are not resistant to revising their work," principal Jack Schwartz explains, "because they have a clear understanding of what makes good work, and their desire to do good work is supported by the safe opportunities they are provided with to improve."<P>  	The students at Miller Avenue see their teachers take risks, and are encouraged to follow their lead. Written into the school's mission statement is that "curiosity, individual initiative and innovative approaches to teaching and learning are to be encouraged." In terms of assessment strategies, this means that students work alongside their teachers to create the criteria and rubrics used to evaluate student products.<P>	In Ms. Calone's second grade class, students learn how to evaluate different levels of work. Their first experience with creating an evaluation rubric occurs during a science unit on the solar system. This unit stresses research skills and creativity, and culminates in a Planet Poster Project, for which each student is required to create a 2' X 3' poster displaying at least nine facts he or she has discovered about a self-selected planet in our solar system. <P> </BODY> </HTML>

The culture of the school is familial, with everyone taking responsibility for one another. This culture manifests itself in teachers interacting with students from other classes, and in students listening and responding to other students share their work. Each Friday, a whole school assembly celebrates children's accomplishments, which range from big performances to small ones. Students present their achievements in groups or on their own in the form of short plays, violin recitals, original story readings, or oral presentations. These assemblies fulfill a dual purpose, in that they teach children how to perform and share their work with others, as well as how to be good audience members. <P> 	The principal, Mr. Schwartz, believes his staff and students' ability to embrace alternative assessment can be traced to the school district's fifteen years of commitment to the writing process and its philosophy of emphasizing student-centered learning. Use of the writing process begins in primary school and continues throughout elementary school.  <P>	Students at Miller Avenue are well-rehearsed at learning and reacting to their peers' work, as classes continually present their projects to other classes. A weekly fifth-grade news show serves as an opportunity for peers to give each other the kind of specific feedback they learn to provide in their classes. Teachers at every grade level help students articulate observations in concrete and specific terms, and examine both positive points of feedback and more critical ones indicating areas that need improvement. <P> 	An example of peer evaluation can be found in Ms. Schwartz' fourth-grade class, where students learn about weather from their own point of interest, for example, lightning, weather reporting, or hurricanes, and are given a choice of presentation format: either a skit or poster.  Both formats are evaluated by rubrics developed in conjunction with another fourth-grade class.  Students help one another analyze their work and make it better, and are so challenged to do their best that they return to completed posters and make improvements, even if the posters are already on display. Students who put on skits that do not conform well to the oral presentation evaluation rubric are free to add an appropriate assessment category: for example, one which is specific to a skit involving role-playing.<P><B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="RUBRIC">Developing the  Planet Poster Rubric</A></B><P>	In Ms. Calone's self-contained, second-year class, students are familiar with the process of developing criteria for one's work, because they are also familiar with the writing process. New to these students, however, is the process of weighting the various criteria they develop. Students gain experience with this element of self-assessment through the Planet Research Project. <P> 	Ms. Calone has been working on authentic assessment projects with teachers Gale Neuner and Allyson Adams from Wading River, another elementary school in the district. With their help, she has created a project that provides autonomy and freedom for students in terms of how they put together their information on a planet.<P>  	When students finish studying the sun, Earth, and moon as a class and are ready to begin individual research on one of the planets in the solar system, Ms. Calone brings in completed posters done by children from Wading River Elementary School. Looking at the best posters, the class determines what it is about the work that makes it so accomplished. Then, as a class, they record what they notice about these well-done posters and incorporate these observations into an evaluation rubric, as attributes of a poster that would warrant an evaluation of "good." After the good category is developed, the students work backwards (and forwards) to delineate the different poster qualifications for each rung in the rubric  excellent, good, okay or needs work (see <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="prompt.HTM">Prompt</A>). <P><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="info"><B>Gathering Information</B></A><P>To begin the Project, students select one of the nine planets to study. They then place two written questions, which they must find answers to during the course of their research, in their planet investigation notebook. These questions are: How long is a day on your planet? How long is a year? All other questions are student-generated (pages filled with information in the students' notebooks indicate how many questions they have about their planets). During the month that students research their planet, they meet several times each week to talk and share resources with classmates who are studying the same planet. The resources available to students range from articles and information written at an age-appropriate level (and put into folders brought in by the teacher), to books and posters.  A favorite resource with information at the students' own level is <I>The Magic School Bus into the Solar System</I>, by Joanna Cole.<P>	At various stages of the research process, each student has a conference with the teacher to discuss what he or she has found, and how he or she has processed this information. Ms. Calone helps each child hone the questions he or she has developed and find helpful resources towards answering them; she also refers peers to one another in an effort to get students thinking about their classmates as resource consultants. <P> 	After about two weeks, when students think they have finished gathering information, Ms. Calone reviews with them the information they will want to include in their poster. About three weeks into the Project, the poster making begins. Students again go over with their teacher what is required for the poster, including a centered title with careful spacing of letters, answers to the questions about a student's planet, and a drawing of the sun and all the planets in proper order.<P> <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="EVALUATE"><B>Peer Evaluation and Conferencing</B></A> <P>As they complete their posters, students work in pairs, using the rubric to evaluate one another's work and explaining their evaluations (e.g., why their partner's use of color is only okay or why the use of space is excellent). For example, Jarrett and Josh go through each category on the rubric; look at each poster one at a time; and decide which level of the rubric each aspect of the poster  i.e., title, spelling, or illustrations  corresponds to, and why. The evidence is written into a blank grid on the rubric. Students are encouraged to redo parts of their posters based on their partner's comments or suggestions. In this spirit, Jarrett shows Josh a way to match certain facts with certain illustrations on his poster (i.e., by drawing borders in the same color around the matching facts and pictures).<P> 	The last stage of the process involves students meeting with Ms. Calone to discuss their evaluations of each other's work based on the rubric (see <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="evaluate.HTM">EVALUATION</A>). Ms. Calone examines their evidence and agrees or disagrees with the assessments they have made. In these conferences, students and teacher work together to arrive at a final score. For example, Jarrett and Josh's original assessments of each other's work were a bit inflated, so they were revised for the final conference with Ms. Calone to more accurately reflect the quality of their posters.<P> <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Sharing Information"><B>Sharing work</B></A> <P> After the posters have been completed, each student presents his or her poster to the class and explains some of the information he or she learned about a certain planet. It is established in class that a planet will be represented by the entire group of students who have chosen to study it, but that each student in the group will discuss a few facts. Ms. Calone reminds the students that they are the experts on their individual planet, and that as researchers of their planet, they are responsible for teaching the rest of the class about what they have learned. Classmates in the audience are expected to listen carefully and ask questions of the presenters. The criteria below were generated through a class discussion designed to help students make good presentations and be active audience members. <P><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="presentation"><B>CRITERIA FOR PRESENTATION</B></A><BR><OL><LI>Face the audience <LI>Keep eyes open, don't look down <LI>Speak loudly - clearly - slowly <LI>Be serious<LI>Choose your best information</OL><BR><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="AUDIENCE"><B>CRITERIA FOR BEING A GOOD AUDIENCE</B><BR><OL><LI>Be quiet<LI>Look at the presenter<LI>Listen carefully<LI>Be kind and polite<LI>Make nice comments<LI>Raise your hand to ask a question  <LI>Self-reflection</OL><P>The posters are displayed in the hallway outside the classroom for a week. During this time, students are asked to write reflections on the Planet Poster Project, and to answer questions such as: "What did you learn?" "What did you enjoy the most or find the most challenging?" "What would you do differently next time?" "How, if at all, was the rubric helpful to you?" This self-reflection piece is broken down so that a couple of questions are answered each day for about a week until all are answered (see <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="evaluate.HTM">Evaluation</A>). The students then make another illustration of their planet on a large postcard addressed to their families, and write a message as though on vacation to the planet. The poster, the postcard, the self-reflection questionnaire, and the rubric that gets filled out at the final conference are all sent to students' homes, to give their families a sense of just how much work went into the Planet Poster Project. <P>  <HR></BODY> </HTML>

In preparation for their research, students learn about the sun, the earth, and the moon (see Context).<P>	At the beginning of the students' investigation of their chosen planet, Ms. Calone assigns two questions that have to be answered: How long is a day on your planet?  How long is a year on your planet? Students also generate questions, and answer them with facts they uncover. At least nine facts are required for the final poster. <P>	This year, students review excellent posters made by Wading River Elementary School students in their own Planet Poster Investigation Project. Reproduced below is the rubric Ms. Calone's class developed collectively, after determining the criteria for excellent work based on the posters they saw, as well as the criteria for other levels of quality (good, okay, needs work) in their peers' and their own products.<P><HR><B>POSTER RUBRIC</B><BR><B>TITLE</B><UL><LI>Needs Work (1) - Your title is too small.

I had looked forward to the differences and I found many.  	"I wasn't sure what the difference would be moving to rubrics rather than just using criteria, and I found students using the rubric more than they used just the criteria in the past because it was more specific and thus more self-directing for them.  Everyone thought the students just used the criteria anyway, but the rubric descriptors enable them to get at the subtleties and differences in their own work.  It is helping kids to begin to articulate what are the nuances and differences.  At first I thought using a rubric was perhaps a little harsh for second graders, but it was an eye-opener for many and encouraging for others. 	'I am now sold on rubrics, because it helps students understand more clearly what the expectations are, they know what the goal is and what to do to come up with a good project.  They're a part of the developing of criteria and the ongoing monitoring of their own progress, not just someone else putting a final judgment on them from nowhere.  Therefore, they are more willing to revise and improve  the assessment is not at the end but all throughout.  	"Time is an issue in using rubrics  you have to be willing to put the time in, it's a commitment.  I believe the time is very well spent in terms of students being motivated and caring about their work.  But you do need the freedom to spend that kind of time on the process.	"I really liked seeing the students enjoying the work and working together, helping each other.  I was paying attention to  each student's attitude and process on this project as much as their end product  looking towards habits of mind, a willingness to be persistent, open and flexible.  All of the students were confident and felt they could do this project because there was not one expectation, no one right way only; it was up to them and so they felt and were able to do it. The more experience they have with rubrics, the more will be done automatically. This is the foundation for building a culture and a language." </BLOCKQUOTE><P><HR WIDTH 85%>  [The following comments were made by attendees at the rubric workshop, a full-day, in-service seminar for 2nd- and 3rd-grade teachers all across the district that occurs during the Planet Poster Project]:<P><B>Ms. Adams:</B>  "Students asked each other if their work was good instead of always asking the teacher. And the kids responded with their newly acquired language about ways to improve the posters.

Letting them explore how to design the posters themselves, they were selective in what they utilized of each other's ideas and really had their own sense of how they wanted the posters to be.<BR>  	"It's important to have exemplars of related work whether they be from other students or professional ones like we used professional posters to come up with what made them so special. <BR>	"It's been nice to share with other teachers outside our building. And the kids were very excited to share their posters with a different school. It gave them another authentic audience." <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><B>Pat:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>"I like to create a general rubric so it can be used over and over and kids become familiarized with what it all means.<BR>	"Sharing something with others gives the project a special purpose.<BR>	"Using a rubric helps with ongoing assessment rather than just one shot deal.<BR>	"Rubrics really help with goal setting. One student said honestly ' I think I'll do a good poster.'  When I asked him why not an excellent poster, he answered, 'Oh, it's too much work.'  So, he really did understand the differences and later he changed his mind and aimed for excellent.<BR>	"It becomes okay to say, I don't like this, I want to change it.  It's exciting to see kids caring so much.<BR>	"The student then initiates the changes or observations about the work and it moves that away from the teacher onto the student.<BR>	"Creating descriptors is key to understanding and giving direction as to what the student needs to do next.  It helps with self-monitoring and is an active use of the criteria."</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><B>Mary:</B> <BLOCKQUOTE>"It's worth the time it takes to assess this way if you are going to have students know how to evaluate their own work. <BR> 	"Using poor as a category seems too much like failing and if we want kids to be learners, we want them to have a sense of the ability to improve.<BR>	"I like to see most of the work done in class for those reasons, I want to monitor it and hear/see the process.  Especially using the CD-ROM for research, you have to be sure in the rubric that the information has to be written in their own words.  This should be indicated on the rubrics.<BR>	"Next time I work with a rubric, I'll use words instead of numbers  they are more meaningful."</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>  <B>Ms. Adams:</B> "Our students worked with a rubric we developed that was ranked 1-2-3 and they invented 2.5 to equal very good, in between 2 and 3."<p><B>Barbara: </B><BLOCKQUOTE>"My second graders came up with the titles of each level of the rubric and one of them was poor, so we called it a do-over so it didn't seem so final, since that's really what it means.<BR>	"Though it was tough at times, pushing through to forming a rubric from the criteria was worth it.

The eleven-week, multi-step project is done with each of Manorhaven's sixth-year classes, and will be done at the fifth-year level starting this year.

The frustrations, challenges, and moments of triumph that any researcher experiences will be theirs as well."<P>	The educational approach Manorhaven School demonstrates through this project is one in which students initiate their own learning.

Historically, the Investigation Project has been done with sixth-year students only, but beginning this year the Project will also be done at the fifth-year level. Some modifications are being made to address the needs of the younger students.<P>	Manorhaven has heterogeneously grouped classes. Twenty-one percent of the students receive English as a Second Language instruction. Although the district has eliminated most self-contained special education classes, the Investigation Project has been done with a 5th/6th-grade special education class.in the past. This class teamed up with Mr. Grande, the teacher whose sixth-year class is profiled here, and his students for the entire Project.<P>	The Investigation Project began in 1981 with discussions including Dr. Welles, then a language arts coordinator, and other teachers in the East Williston School District about their process of inquiry. The goal of these educators was to translate their personal and professional experiences into a curriculum for children, in much the same way as those who originated the process of teaching writing drew on the experiences of real-world writers to do so.<P>	The idea behind the Investigation Project was that the principles involved in teaching writing could also be applied to the research process. In this spirit, Dr. Welles explains the importance of "giving students on-going instruction and response throughout the research process rather than waiting to respond to a final product; slowing down the process; giving chunks of time during the school day to work rather than making it an at-home assignment only; and designing structures for students to help one another."<P>  	After the philosophy and initial design of the Investigation Project had been established, teachers who implemented the original Investigation curriculum refined it as their students' experiences with the Project indicated where more or less structural support was needed.<P> 	Manorhaven's current teachers also work at improving the Project. Mr. Grande, for his part, continually refines the Investigation Project curriculum by creating structures to support each student and his or her individual learning style. For example, to help a student who writes reluctantly and has problems meeting deadlines, Mr. Grande established a system of regular communication with the child's parents at the beginning of the Investigation Project.<P><B>Student Ownership and Topic Selection</B><P>The first thing students realize about the Investigation Project is that they are in charge. <BR><BR> Dr. Welles gives an initial lesson in the school's library to all three sixth-year classes, and explains both the Project and how students might generate topics. She facilitates an open-ended discussion - among students, teachers, librarian, and herself -- to get students thinking about themselves as researchers by asking internal questions such as: "What things do I like?" and "What things do I want to know more about?"<P>	Many students' topics reflect familial influences. For example, Samantha, a sixth-year student, began researching the New York Stock Exchange by interviewing her father, a former stock broker. Another student, Glenn, chose to study ham radio communication, which is a hobby of his father's.<P>	Dr. Welles models choosing and narrowing a subject of interest until it is manageable. One student originally selected the military as his subject of interest, which he soon realized was just too broad. With help from Dr. Welles, the school librarian Ms. Auerbach, and other students, Sean was able to narrow his topic to military aircraft, then to fighter planes. As he explained, 'the other [topics] just would have been too much for the reader."<P>	Though students typically progress at markedly different rates - some write "feverishly" while others remain stuck in figuring out how they want to begin and what type of lead they want to write - Mr. Grande reassures his students of their knowledge and expertise. "These are your projects," he tells them. "You are the expert. You know more than I do about your subject.  You have to convince your readers of what you've learned." Mr. Grande also tells his students that initially they should put down on paper whatever comes into their heads.<P>  <B>Forming Authentic Questions and Providing Models</B><BR><BR>At the beginning of the eleven-week Investigation Project, the class uses a block of about sixty minutes per day to work on related lessons, some of which require the entire sixth year to converge in the library. As students become more involved in notetaking, Mr. Grande increases the amount of class time set aside for work on the Investigation Project, but divides this time into segments of about 45 minutes in the morning and 45 minutes in the afternoon.<P>	The creation of important research questions is the focus of several lessons in the first two weeks of the Investigation Project. In these lessons, students write what they already know about their topic; why they are interested in it; and how they have learned about it so far.  From here, students are asked to generate questions about their topic. To help them develop useful questions, Mr. Grande chooses a subject that no one in the class is studying, and with students' help, generates questions about it that he would want to research and answer.<P>	Samantha explains that one of the most important parts of the Investigation Project occurs at the very beginning, when students fill out what are referred to as Blue Sheets. "The Blue Sheet is where you write down all the questions you want answers to about your topic," she explains.  "Then in your rough draft, you make sure you've answered them." At the bottom of the Blue Sheet, students also list all possible resources to get information, and cross reference words to look up. <P>	Students are taught how to use INFOTRAC, the card catalogue, indices, and the reader's guide to periodicals. They are also asked to think about both print and non-print media, including human resources, in order to challenge preconceived notions of where information can be found.<P><B>Taking Notes and Organizing Information</B><BR><BR>Each student has a box on his or her desk where notecards are kept. Students learn to put only one fact on a notecard, along with a code or symbol for the source, and the page number where the information was found. A key card delineates bibliographic references.<P>	Ms. Auerbach, the librarian, plays a key role in this team-taught, information-gathering and notetaking part of the Investigation Project. She helps students weed out important from extraneous data, and determine which pieces of information they collect are useful. In addition, she coordinates trips to other libraries, including the middle school and public libraries; teaches students about the computerized resources available to them in school and at other libraries; brings in resources from other places; and discusses individual student needs with teachers.<P>	One of the unique ways students obtain information for their Projects is by writing letters and interviewing people over the phone or in person. If students are sent pictures, these are often used in students' final presentations, while useful textual information gets transformed into notecards for the final report. Mr. Grande requires each student to write a minimum of five letters, hoping that they will get responses from at least three. A model lesson is given on how to write a business letter and address an envelope. <P>	After the students have been researching their subjects for 6-8 weeks and have amassed most of the notecards they will ultimately use, they sit down with and "teach" a partner. Without using their notes, the new teachers speak about what they have learned thus far, and reveal the information they found most interesting. The "students" ask questions to uncover areas requiring more investigation or greater clarification.<P><B>Student Writing and Visuals</B><BR><BR>"What do I use?" "What do I include?" "How do I include it?" These are among the "burning questions" students are expected to consider once they are ready to write their drafts. The Blue Sheet of questions students compile while researching their topics enables them to go back and look at what they wanted to learn when they began their investigations. The questions lend structure to the final research paper by helping students choose what information to include or leave out.<P>		Mr. Grande and the principal demonstrate how to write leads. They provide examples of different writers' usage of anecdotes and other audience-grabbing strategies. From here, the serious process of writing first drafts takes two to three weeks. According to Mr. Grande, almost every child completes a first draft on time. Of this year's batch, he says, "80% were good first drafts while the other 20% had to be significantly reworked. So, we sat down and had one-on-one meetings with the students who were struggling - this included involving the resource room teacher and trying to give them some specific pointers and strategies."<P> 	During the draft-writing period, approximately 1 hour each day is allotted for students to write from their notecards, which they have already organized and categorized, and to meet with a partner or the teacher to work through any difficulties. Students also view Investigation Projects from years past to expose them to many different presentation formats, topics, and kinds of projects, and to help them recognize good work. Mr. Grande explains that "some [of the older Investigation Projects] were very good, some were not so good.  And the kids were able to make very good judgments about that." The principal, Dr. Welles, describes this part of the process as "helping kids set standards for themselves."<P> 	After they write their drafts, students are encouraged to think about what visuals they might create to engage the viewer and accompany their written work. Suggestions include breaking up the text with a chart or picture or creating a three-dimensional model. Peer conferences help students broaden their understanding of what readers need. Sean, who is writing about fighter planes, plans to include in his Investigation Project a huge collage made from images of fighter planes, and a model of a jet which he constructed.<P><B>Final Presentation: 'Author's Tea'</B><BR><BR>Students have a week after handing in their final papers to make necessary corrections or revisions. At the end of this week, when all the Investigation Projects are completed, each sixth-year class is given time in the library for their "author's tea." At the author's tea, the sixth-year students celebrate their accomplishments. They also read one another's work and make positive comments. Each project has an author, title, and a subject catalogue card. Some of the projects have large visuals, which are displayed throughout the library, and each child has a "mailbox" - an envelope with his or her name on it, into which viewer/reader comments can be put. The Investigation Projects are kept on display in the library for an entire month or more, so that peers, teachers, administrators, parents, board members, and others can examine them and put notes into the corresponding authors' mailboxes. <P>	So that all of Manorhaven's students are able to view the Investigation Projects, the librarian, takes each grade, K-6, to the library during a regularly scheduled library period. Once there, students explore all of the displays, and write a responsive comment to at least one Investigation Project, which then gets placed in the appropriate mailbox. Should this visit prove insufficient, time-wise, to satisfy the younger students'curiosity about the Investigation Projects, they may return to the library during an "open library time" to re-visit the projects and possibly write more comments. So that parents might view the work their daughters and sons have created, an evening celebration for the sixth-year students and their parents or guardians is scheduled.<P>  <HR></BODY> </HTML>

Both parents and students receive letters from the school's principal and sixth-year teachers, detailing the stages and goals of the Project. In addition, students are given a checklist delineating the tasks they will be undertaking (see below).<P><H3>Parent Letter</H3><P>Dear Parents,<BR>	The sixth-year classes are presently engaged in the process of inquiry. Each student has been given the opportunity to select a topic of his/her choice, and that interest will serve as the vehicle for learning and using research skills. We feel you should understand the goals and expectations of this Investigation Project.<BR>	One important goal of this project is for students to see the significance of research and research skills in their own lives. We also expect their concept of research to expand beyond "library research" and beyond the narrow focus of a particular school-assigned "report."  They will investigate through direct experiences with people, places, and things as well as indirect experiences with media, books, periodicals, newspapers, and discussion.<P>		Skills to be stressed during this investigation include:<P><UL><LI> Selecting and delimiting a subject<LI> Asking questions<LI> Selecting appropriate resources<LI> Discovering and using specific reference tools<LI> Selecting main ideas; what is important/relevant and what is not<LI> Learning to read first, take notes later; how to take notes without copying from a text<LI> Organizing, categorizing information and ideas<LI> Synthesizing and presenting the results of investigation in written form</UL><P>		Throughout the project, we will provide opportunities in class for students to have the same kind of peer and teacher feedback on their inquiry process and products as they have in the Writing Workshop, with the expectation that students will draft, revise, edit and proofread their final products.<P>	This is a major project which requires much of your child. You can be of help by assisting in the area of resources. For example, some students will arrange to do first-hand research through visits to factories, museums, local businesses, etc. Parents can assist by providing transportation. Should these visitations occur during school hours, it will be your child's responsibility to bring in a note from you and to complete any class work or homework that is missed.<P>	Your child may also need your help to get to a public library. Locating and collecting "people-resources" is another task with which students are likely to need assistance.<P>	In providing support, help your child become an independent investigator. An important aspect of this process for each student is to clarify thinking by talking with others about the subject under investigation. As parents, you can best help your child by listening and asking questions.<P><H3>Student Letter</H3><P>Dear Student:<BR>	Attached you will find an "Investigation Checklist." As you can see, there are many tasks for which you are responsible. The process by which you achieve your final product is at least as important as the product itself.  It will be your responsibility to have each task checked by a teacher, signed and evaluated. Therefore, as you complete each task, be sure to get a teacher's evaluation. Don't forget to pay attention to due dates. Unless your teacher has checked, signed, and evaluated all of the tasks, your work for each week will be considered incomplete.<P>P.S.

Although the teacher acts as primary evaluator to his or her students, much of the important feedback students receive comes from peers, outside visitors, and other school personnel who respond to students' work with notes in their mailboxes (see <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="context.HTM">Context</A>).<P> 	Mr. Grande evaluates students during the Project through observation and via the student evaluation checklist (see<!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="prompt.HTM"> Prompt</A>). He also conducts individual conferences with students, in which he reviews their journal entries.<P>	At the end of the Investigation Project, students assess their own performance, completing a self-evaluation sheet. Each student also receives a final evaluation from Mr. Grande, which indicates both areas of excellence and thoseareas or skills in which the student could improve. Mr. Grande uses a rubric to evaluate a student's performance on specific tasks according to one of three levels: Showing Strength, Actively Developing Skill, or Having Difficulty. To the final evaluations, he adds individualized letters in praise of each child's overall good work.<P>	During the time the projects are on display, Mr. Grande takes one or two home each night for evaluation.

The research skills used to be taught haphazardly, and they weren't taught in a fashion where children were able to use what skill they learned and apply it to a writing project.  These skills were taught in the past apart from each other.  They were skills we all felt as sixth-year teachers were extremely important but they were taught in isolation. What this project does is bring those skills into a context that the children understand and, more importantly, are able to go and apply. They get reinforced each time they use them.  That is a tremendous component.  You've seen what the kids look like - their high level of confidence and self-satisfaction with what they've accomplished and are doing.<P>	"What's different in the Investigation Project from a more test-based assessment is that there is more personal, one-to-one contact and there's a more narrative type of evaluation; it's not an evaluation that's done strictly by the numbers. I think there is also different growth for different children. When you just give a test and someone gets a 95%, what does that tell you other than he got 95% of the test correct? In this project you can see children like Seung-Hyun, who struggles with her English, and you can see the effort that that kid is making to write English the way her ESL teacher and I are trying to teach her, and you see her concern, grappling with when she gets it and when she doesn't get it.<P>	"My ideal student in terms of this Investigation Project would be someone who is turned on to the concept of learning about a topic, not me teaching them about the topic. I say to them at the end,' You are the experts. You are the people who know about jet aircrafts, the stock exchange ... I know a little bit, but you know more than me because of what you have read and what you have researched.' <P>	"I think the journals fell down a bit with this particular class. It was hard to get them to reflect upon their progress. They were excited and I could tell things were happening for them with their work, but they weren't writing it down. In fact, I imagine most of them are stuck in the 'We've finally finished our notecards and I'm happy that the notetaking part is over' [mind set]. I'm going to have them make another entry before they hand in their final drafts tomorrow.  I want to hear what they feel now.<P>	"More parental feedback is an area we could explore more. Of course you get comments from parents when you see them in the hallway or if you happen to be at a meeting with them.  And I have found that all of their comments have been most positive. How they could get themselves involved and make it known what they think of the project would be a good idea.  Maybe a parent information night at the beginning of the project would help. Certainly the author's celebration with the parents at the end helped."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>	<B>Ms. Auerbach, librarian:</B><BR><BLOCKQUOTE>"It's the process and skills taught that are the most important contribution of the Investigation Project. Content is something students need to learn over and over again to internalize and is important as well, but a process of learning is something that stays with students from the onset. Inquiry-based learning is especially important at the elementary level.<P>	"What's exciting as a librarian, is that this project teaches students to love and use libraries intelligently. This project recognizes the library as a place where teaching happens and the librarian as someone who can collaborate with classroom teachers. The librarian here is seen not just as someone who has information but someone who can help students learn how to find information, [which is] an integral part of building a school culture of self-inquiry and questioning."<P></BLOCKQUOTE><B>Ms. Adler, 3rd-grade teacher:</B><BR>"It was wonderful to see my 3rd-graders become so involved with the 'older kids' projects. Some of the 6th graders would even stop my 3rd-graders in the hall and say, 'Thanks for your comment'! Even the kindergartners were given a chance to write comments about the projects. This was wonderful for their literacy development."<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>STUDENTS</FONT></B><P><B>Josh:</B> "We had lots of meetings with teachers, the librarian, the principal ... First we decided on our topic and then we went as a class to the public library and the Junior High School library."<B>Asa:</B> "The Investigation Project was fun and challenging because if you really like your topic you could learn a lot more about it.  It gave you a chance to go to interesting places to interview people about your topic.  For me it was fun to be able to draw, too.  And it didn't have to be all serious, I could make it funny, but still informative.  I had never looked at the history of comics which started at the turn of the century or how they are made.  It was great to see your finished project and see other people read your project and appreciate your accomplishment.<BR>	"It was fun to get responses from other kids especially. And to read what other people think about your project, kind of like Siskel and Ebert.<BR>	"The frustrating part for me was writing 10 letters and not getting anything back. Plus all the crossing out and erasing on the drafts. I also got behind on the notecards and had trouble meeting all the deadlines. Now it'll be easier to devote myself to the work because I know how to do a research project."<P><B>Samantha:</B> "It was good to see what my mom invests in - that's why I chose the topic [of the stock exchange] and my dad used to be a stock broker, so he was my main interview.  I didn't know all that stock talk and had no idea what the Dow Jones was and now I know. The Investigation Project isn't just work - it's fun. I'd never done a report using notecards instead of copying out of a book. This was all my own words. This wasn't just about filling up a report with facts for the teacher to give you a good grade. Since no one else chooses your exact topic, no one can copy from you or steal your ideas - it's all your own. Also all the resources are there for you, less competition for books."<P><B>Seung-Hyun:</B> "I lived in Korea until last year, so I knew something about it, but I wanted to share it with others and my friends.  I picked to study the parts I like the best like the holidays and famous places I used to go and I did learn more about Korea that I didn't [know] before.  I didn't want to do just a report with facts, I decided to use the letters to make it more interesting. I want everybody to like my project, not just the teacher.  It took a lot of time to do the proofreading and fix the mistakes.  I'm going to help my brother learn how to do a report like this. Copying out of books, it doesn't sound like a sixth grader."<P><B>So-Young:</B> "The author's tea was fabulous.  Reading other students' investigations was fun. Printing the final copy was exciting. Getting compliments made me feel good."<P><P ALIGN=CENTER>For more information, please contact:<BR>Jack Grande<BR>Manorhaven Elementary School<BR>Morewood Oaks<BR>Port Washington, NY  11050<BR</P>></BODY> </HTML>

Out of the many questions, I was mainly curios to find out how glaciers change the land.  I was specifically interested in this subject because of the groves at Umpire rock. They lead me to believe that it was caused by glaciers and I need to back up my opinion with facts. I was also interested in finding out how do glaciers cause erosion? What are glaciers? And these are a few of the many questions that need to be answered.<P>	Glaciers are defined as a large body of moving ice and snow. The process of a glacier forming is when most snow that falls on the land and melts to form water running down over land surfaces.  However in some parts of the world it's too cold for snow to melt, so year after year it piles up. After a while all that snow is squeezed together becomes very heavy and the body of snow or ice moves.<P>	One kind of glacier is called a Valley glacier. Valleys are found in mountainous areas all over the world.  Their physical appearance are often rivers of dirty ice filling mountain valleys. Gravitational pull is able to move these valley glaciers. Meaning that gravity will pull it down to the ground away from the mountains. Valley glaciers creep down mountains at a rate of 25-60cm a day. As several valley glaciers pile up as they are being pulled down they from a large valley glacier. Valley glaciers are pulled by pressure therefore they don't flow, instead they crack. These great cracks are called crevasses. Crevasses also occur near the edges when one part of the glacier moves faster than other parts.<P>	Another kind of glacier is a Continental glacier. Continental glaciers are huge sheets of ice that cover thousands of square kilometers. Two such glaciers are called icecaps. Icecaps cover most of Antarctica and Greenland. Icecaps are shaped like domes. Their movements are caused by their great weight.<P><B>Glacial Erosion</B><BR><BR>Glacial erosion is caused when gravel and pieces of rock are frozen into the ice at the bottom of a glacier. When a glacier moves over the bedrock, the rocks in the glacier scrape across the bedrock. Small pieces of bedrock are carried away by he scarping rocks. These pieces of bedrock are pushed along in front of the glacier.<P>	As the glacier scrapes away the floor of the valley, the valley becomes U-shaped. Sometimes glaciers that are not yet properly formed flow into the main valley. These unformed glaciers are called side glaciers. When these side glaciers do disappear and melt, they leave small valleys high above the main valleys.  These valleys are called hanging valleys. Large rocks and sediments are often frozen into a glacier, as the glacier moves these rocks and sediments are carried to new places. As a glacier moves into a warmer area, the ice begins to melt around the edges of the moving glacier. After this happens the glacier starts to wear or shrink away. Rocks and sediments that were frozen in the ice are left behind. The materials that are deposited is called till.<P>	Big rocks, boulders by retreating glaciers are called erratic. Central park is known for having carried many boulders. The boulders are like bedrock located hundreds of kilometers away. The boulders are too heavy and too big to have been moved by running water or by humans. The only thing that could've moved these great big and heavy boulders is a glacier. It so happens that 65 million years ago The Wisconsin Glacier passed through Central Park. And most of the shaped rocks that this glacier formed has been more of the fascinating aspects of rock study in Central Park today.<P><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="LAB">LAB: GLACIAL TRAIL</A>Lab <BR><BR><UL><LI> Title: <B>Glacial Trail</B><LI><B>Introduction:</B> Based on the information from our first visit at Central Park on Umpire Rock, my lab will prove how it is that glaciers do change the land.<LI> <B>Materials:</B> Stream table, sand, gravel, ice cube, 2 bars of soap, and carton.<LI> <B>Procedure:</B><OL><LI> freeze the water carton to make ice - 2/3 of the way and put gravel and sand in also.<LI> fill the stream table with gravel and sand not all the way.  Leave space at the bottom.<LI> put the stream table at a slant position.<LI> put the ice on top of the stream table (make sure that you have a photograph for 	observation).<LI> If it doesn't move by itself you have to push it down gently until it reaches the 	bottom of the sand.<LI> allow it sit overnight.<LI> afterwards record observations and take photographs and also written observations.</OL><LI> <B>Results:</B> After letting it sit for 2 days, I found an interesting thing. The glacier had melted at the bottom and made a lake.  It left behind rocks on its way down. There was scratches on the soaps. One of the soaps were turned. There was a bunch of rocks at the bottom in the lake.<LI> <B>Analysis</B> - Evaluation on Lab:  After doing the experiment it all became clear to me. The glacier that had passed Central Park had also in my own little passed through the stream table.  At first the soap moved so we put it back to its original position and pushed it down again. The second time it still moved that explains the 2 different grooves that are scraped on the first soap. That second soap had its original grooves. This is how I was finally convinced that a glacier had passed Central Park.<P></ol><B>BEFORE</B><A HREF="b4grfx.HTM"><IMG SRC="BEFORE1.gif" ALT="photo of Pre-experiment" ALIGN=BOTTOM><P></A><B>25% OF ORIGINAL SIZE</B><BR><P><B>AFTER</B><a href="aftgrfx.HTM"><IMG SRC="AFTER1.gif" ALT="photo of Pre-experiment" ALIGN=BOTTOM></a><BR><P><B>25% OF ORIGINAL SIZE</B><P>	My second visit to Central Park was basically to rediscover more glaciers and also to prove to myself that what I've learned in class was definitely beneficial.  As I arrived at Central Park I was amazed at how I could identify everything that was at Umpire rock.<P>	I even found more glaciers in different places which I took pictures of. I also found erratic in different places. I also took pictures of them. The first glacier which is the original glacier that I based by Big Question, so I took I picture of it. The second glacier you could notice the difference because the part whether the glacier passed its lighter because it's worn out. The third glacier is also noticeable by vision. You could see the way that the glacial grooves scraped the land just by looking at the pictures.<P><a href="glaciergrfx.HTM"><IMG SRC="GLACIER1.GIF" ALT="photo of Glacier's Trail" ALIGN=BOTTOM></a><BR><B>50% OF ORIGINAL SIZE</B><P><HR><a href="eraticgrfx.HTM"><IMG SRC=" ERATIC1.gif" ALT="photo of Eratic Glacier Trail" ALIGN=BOTTOM></a><BR><B>50% OF ORIGINAL SIZE</B><P>	The first eratic was right next to the second glacier.  But the first erratic amazed me because it's just there, it has no connection to the other rock that it's laying on. The second erratic was the same, except that this one was round. The third erratic was the same but architects but big metal poles to make sure that it doesn't fall on top of tourists because it's hanging.  I was very happy to identify everything that I saw. <P><!-- Anchor POINT Tag --><A NAME="SYNTHESIS"><B>Synthesis</B></A><BR><P>How Do Glaciers Change the Land?<P><BR>	Every section in my report answers my Big Question in its own little way. For example, my background information tells my reader about a glacier itself. This information is provided so that the reader is fit to compare what happened at Central Park. My Lab section shows you physically what a glacier loooks like and also what it does. Then there are some pictures of itself. The diagrams are there also for visual use, to explain what is not seen in the pictures. Then I went back for more.  The next section shows further knowledge of the even more glaciers and I decided to throw in some erratic, in which I talked about in my background information. There you also have pictures that very useful. And last but not least a diagram of Umpire Rock and indications of where my beautiful glaciers and erratics are located. There is also a map of Central Park, including where Umpire Rock is that.

I went to observe the Geological Features of Umpire Rock and Cleopatra's Needle. They both interested me, but after alot of thought, I choose to study Cleopatra's Needle or the obelisk as it is called on the Central Park Map.<P>	The obelisk is an ancient Egyptian tribute to Ra, the sun god. It was built in 1600 B.C. and brought to the United States in 1881.  However, it was not erected in Central Park until 1940. It is weathered away on the west side of the obelisk and not the east and so my question is why is the west side of the obelisk more damaged than the east? [See Appendix for sample photo of Cleopatra's Needle.]<P>	Cleopatra's Needle is about 60-90 feet tall. It is made of granite, a type of rock made from cooled lava.  Originally there were heilioglyphic's around the entire obelisk, but the bottom and most of the west side were Faded. Heilioglyphic's are the writtings of ancient Egyptians usually found in the toumbs of pharo's they have helped us to learn of the Egyptians way of life.<P> 	In order to answer my question, I have to study about weathering.  My guess is that most of the damage happened in Egypt by the sand and sun and so I'm going to see how that can affect a rock.  I will also conduct a lab on weathering<P>	I originally had planned to do two labs, however I wound up doing only one because a picture was found of Cleopatra's needle when it arrived and it was not weathered at all which eliminated all possible theories of weathering in Egypt. Since I was obviously wrong about my theory, I decided to point my research in a different direction, the possibility of weathering here, by acid rain and change of temperature.<P>	Acid rain is the result of burned coal, gasoline and other fuel oils being sent into the air where it is mixed with moisture and sent down with the rain. Since all of these fuels were mixed together with the water, the rain gets acidic and becomes acid rain. Since acid is a very strong substance it can wear away rocks.<P> 	Above are two pictures of Cleopatra's Needle. The large one is of the obelisk today and athough it is hard to see the side that were looking at is totally worn away. The smaller picture [of the obelisk in 1881] however shows the same side and all of the heilioglyphic's can be seen.  [Please note: This Photo is not included.]<P>	The lab that I chose to do was on rock ebrasion. It included testing how rocks wear away in different acid types of water. I used 3 marble chips and 3 granite chips, a scale, 2 screens, 2 jars and 2 plastic bottles.<P>	First, I soaked the rocks overnight. The following day I drained them and weighed them. The granite weighed 41.4 grams and the marble 23.2 grams.  I then proceeded in putting the rocks in separate bottles partly filled with water and shaking them for 3 minuetes. I then weighed them again and found that the Granite was weared away, there were little pieces of the rocks on the bottom of the bottle.  Also its weight was now 39 grams. the marble though went up to 23.3 grams. The marble was acting as a sponge. I continued doing this until I reached 15 minutes then I did the same with a weak acid and then a strong acid.  In all acid types the weight went up and down on both rocks.<P>	This lab taught me that acid rain can really cause a rock some serious damage. Even regular rain so I am now almost positive that rain had alot to do with the weathering of Cleopatra's needle.<P>	When I started the lab, I expected the acid to cause more damage. However surprisingly in the granite, the regular tap water made the most extreme changes. The cool thing about that is, it's probably the same water as rain water. I also learned from this lab that the difference between granite and marble in hardness is great. The have a big difference in weight too.  Although Marble is harder than granite, granite's original weight is much higher than marble.<P> Lab I used to study the effects of acidic water<P>Name ___________   Class  ________    Date _______<BR><!--Anchor POINT Tag --><A NAME="topicix"><B>Topic IX THE EROSIONAL PROCESS</B></A><BR>Investigation 34    Rock Abrasion<P>As rocks are carried along by the current of a flowing stream, they tend to wear into smaller and smoother pieces. Do all rocks undergo the same type of change under roughly the same conditions? What happens to the rate of change through time? In this investigation, you will study the physical [and chemical] changes that some rocks undergo in a short period of time by observing them in a model situation.<P><B>Problem:</B>  What effect do hardness of rock and length of time that the rock has been exposed to weathering have on the way rock particles are chnaged by physical [and chemical] weathering?<P>	<B>Objectives:</B>  After you have completed this investigation, you should be able to: 1) State the relationship between time and the rate of abrasion for a rock of particular type or hardness.  2) Compare the effect of abrasion, in a given period of time, upon rock types of differing hardness.<P>	<B>Materials:</B>  100 g pre-soaked marble chips, [quartz,] 100 g pre-soaked hard [limestone, chalk] chips, container and screen for shaking and draining, balance, water, [vinegar]<P><B>Suggested Procedure</B><BR>	A.

This time, it meant so much more to me because I knew more about it. I took pictures of three of the sides, The north, east, and west. I ran out of film before I got the opportunity to get a picture of the South, so I will draw it as best I can. (unfortunatly for the time of day, it was hard to capture the west side as nicely as the east, but your not missing anything, it is completly worn away.)<P>	After my second trip to Central Park, I got copies of weather maps and saw tthat he pattern of rain is generally from the south west to northeast which matches the weathering on cleopatra's needle perfectly. [See Appendix for sample weather map.]<P><A HREF="MAPGRFX.HTM"><IMG SRC="map1.gif" ALT="WEATHER MAP" ALIGN=BOTTOM></A><P>	I now have a new answer to my Big Question after my research. Cleopatra's Needle became weathered by acid rain. Because of pollution from fuel tanks, there is alot of acid rain in New York City and because of that Cleopatras needle became weared away on west and south sides which is where the rain generally hits the obelisk.<P>	I think that the city should look into trying to preserve the obelisk before it is worn away completly. Maybe put a plastic covering on it.<P>	There were times during this project that I wondered if I should have picked Umpire Rock, mostly at the beginning, but now that I have finished my research, I am glad that I choose Cleopatra's needle. I learned alot from the experiance of independent research.<P><P><HR><B>Bibliography</B>Acid Rain Article, Comptons MultiMedia Encyclopedia<BR>Central Park Map<BR>Weather Maps, Times Newspaper<BR>Alan, Bklyn College Academy<BR>Weathering and Erosion, Holt Earth Science<BR>What is Chemical Weathering?

Unfortunately it didn't work as we planned --only moved 1/2 inch down the hall. (Hardly ready to win a race). Now we went straight back to the drawing board and knew what not to do. We designed a smaller "POWER CAR". With iolets screwed right to the bottom of the mousetrap we cut straws, to hold the wheels from sliding, and connected the wheels right to the trap. This seemed to work much, much, better.  When I pushed it down the hall it went all the way down. The only thing on our preliminary cart we have not figured out yet, is how to attach the string to the wheels for the power of movement.<P><B><FONT SIZE=2>DECEMBER 8</FONT></B><BR><BR><B>Performance:</B><BR>  	It went down the hall (about 10M)<BR>Comments: <BR> 	Once we figured out how to attach the string so the car would actually move it went at a decent pace down the hall.  But there was a slight problem. It curves. We figured out the iolets that attached the wheels and axel to the bottom of the mousetrap were crooked causing it to curve. So by the end of the double period we decided now we have a "scratch model" let's rebuild it. So we gathered our materials together for the next week.<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>DECEMBER 14</B></FONT><BR><BR><B>Performance:</B><BR>  	Spun in circles --very exasperating.<BR><B>Comments:</B><BR>  	Well, today was not a good day for our cart.  We realized (after all it would do is spin in circles) the iolets were not put on the mousetrap straight and that's why it spun.  So we took the rest of the time to carefully measure out where to put the iolets.  The cart still didn't go straight.  I think the axels are bent, so next time we'll cut new ones so they are ensured to be straight.  And hopefully our cart will move!!!<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>DECEMBER 22</B></FONT><BR><BR><B>Performance: </B><BR> 	Our car stinks!  It moves about 1 ft. then does a complete 360.<BR><B>Comments:</B><BR>  	We have the same basic structure and it goes straight when we push it but when we wind it up it goes in circles.  Today (because of the snow day this week) we only had one period to work on the car so we redid the iolets and cut new axels in case that was the reason it was going crooked and spinning about.  But we didn't have time to check it in the hallway.<P>  <FONT SIZE=2><B>JANUARY 5</B></FONT><BR><BR><B>Performance:</B><BR>  	Again, unfortunately our car moved about a foot and a half and did a 360.  If there was a contest for the most revolutions we would definately win.<BR><B>Comments:</B><BR>  	Today we took a different approach.  We measured the underneath to make sure it was equal - it was.  We opened the front iolets enough to put a straw in between and put the axel in the straw.  that seemed to get more power in the car.  It still turns, but we think that has something to do with the string - it gets caught and doesn't unravel from the back axel all the way.  So we cut it and will test it next time.  I hope it works!!!<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>JANUARY 12</B></FONT><BR><BR><B>Comments:</B><BR>  	Well, we abandoned all our ideas of our original car and expanded the cart so maybe now it will work!  We expanded the base of the car by putting wood along the side of the mousetrap.  We had to rubbar band a piece of metal on the bottom to give the back of the car some weight.  So far it works!  Not very well --but it it's better than the first one.  It moves down the hall (curves a little) but it moves!!!  It goes about 120 up the hill which is a much better accomplishÐment than our first car!<P><B>JANUARY 17</B><BR><BR><B>Performance:</B><BR>  Speed = 2.44 m/s<BR> Distance = 11.5 m<BR>Hill Climb = 150<BR>Tractor Pull = 20 g<BR><BR><B>Comments:</B><BR>  	It finally works!  And it works pretty well.  Since we extended the axel it gave the car the extra momentum / (and weight) to move.  It travels (at it's best) 11.5m down the hallway.  Also to help the performance of the car we attached 3 rubbar bands (rather than one) to the back wheels for the extra weight in the back.  We also cut straws to attach to the wheels so they could be somewhat stabalized.  I'm so happy it finally works!<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>JANUARY 19</B></FONT><BR><BR><B>Performance:</B><BR>  Speed = 2.8 m/s<BR>Distance = 15 m<BR>Hill Climb = 210<BR>Tractor Pull = 110 g<BR><BR><B>Comments:</B><BR>  	After a long journey, our car finally works.  And it works very well I might add!  When we first tested our car it was not working as well as it did the week before and we couldn't quite figure out why.  Then we found out "secret" the graphite lubricant.  From going 8 m in the hallway it went to 10 then 11.5 then 12 then 15!!  After a "lube job" it went over the top in the hill climb!

Several of the staff members come from other progressive, alternative high schools in New York City such as University Heights High School, Central Park East Secondary School, and City-as-School; other experienced teachers come from the city's comprehensive high schools.<P>		According to the school's graduation requirements, "The fundamental aim of Hamer High School is to teach students to use their minds well and prepare them to live productive, socially useful, and personally satisfying lives." Accordingly, "The school's academic program stresses intellectual development and political/social involvement in our society. Five 'habits of mind' are stressed: <P><OL><LI> helping students to learn to critically examine evidence; <BR><LI> to be able to see the world through multiple viewpoints -- to step into other shoes;<BR> <LI> to make connections and see patterns; <BR><LI> to imagine alternatives (what if? and else?);<BR> <LI> to ask, 'What difference does it make?  Who cares?'"<P>	As part of the school's development of an assessment process, students are evaluated on two Language Portfolios each year in the 9th and 10th grades. Language Portfolio work can be done in either English or Spanish. Rick Levine, one of the Humanities teachers, explains that the staff chose to focus on language because of the importance of "helping students become articulate and expressive people able to be understood by others and able to actively engage in persuading others about their ideas."<P>	FLHFHS is a newly developing school with a large bilingual population. Its teachers hope that the Language Portfolio evaluation process will help them focus on literacy, determine schoolwide standards, and critically examine staff discussions about what is valuable in terms of student work. Each teacher must read and respond to at least six Language Portfolios, all of which are regularly discussed at faculty meetings.<P>	One goal of the Language Portfolio is to help establish a portfolio culture throughout the school. A second goal is to introduce students to certain skills and habits of mind that will help them build graduation portfolios. The Language Portfolio system will continue to be revised as the staff clarifies its goals and practices. <P>  </BODY> </HTML>

Not only have I learned more about you and your growing skills, but I have been encouraged to think through some issues involving all our students.  Thank you.  	Your poem, "One Day a Long Time Ago," is simple and beautiful. It expresses your outrage at this incident of abuse without preaching and because of that, it is most effective.  Now that you have discovered your poetry gift, I hope you will continue to use it. You have much that is important to say and poetry can be a very effective medium of expression.  Equally impressive is the thought which went into the poem and that is reflected in your writing entry slip. It is very important that we reflect thoughtfully on ourselves, our ideas, and our world. I hope you will continue to do this as well as you have in thinking about this poem.<P>  	Your excitement in learning is apparent both from your Math/Science entry and your comments on your Spanish mid-term.  I wonder why you also write that you do little in Spanish. It sounds as if your work on the economy of Venezuela was very helpful both in learning about this nation and in improving your skills in Spanish. I wish you had attacked the Venezuela paper as well. Did you do it in the Spanish language? It seems as if you enjoyed the Math/Science project greatly and learned a lot from it. It is often important to understand how much we are learning. <P> 	It was particularly important to see that you are reading more these days and enjoying what you are reading.  That is a key to your education and to a special joy in life.  I'm glad you're not just pretending to read anymore!  Now it would be helpful to see more reflection on what you read.  The two book reviews you have submitted are incomplete and lack much of the thought you have put into your other work.  You seem to have enjoyed El Bronx Remembered  and The Face on the Milk Carton, but that is hard to tell from what you have written.  You list characters, for example, but never describe any.  If anyone heard only your name - Jesselin - would they know very much about you?  You have not looked at these books with the kind of thought which will bring out a lot more about them and you.  I expect to see a lot more in your June language portfolio.<P>	It appears that your public speaking experiences was a good and valuable one, but, again, it would have been helpful to see what you said and to read any of the evaluations of your work.  How about getting someone to tape it next time?<P>	You are doing some wonderful work, Jesselin, but there is, as you know, some more work to do.

I was glad to read your portfolio today, especially since I don't get the chance to see you and your work on an everyday basis this year. You are making progress and your work is developing. Today I'm going to be "assessing" your work, based on an idea of what you will need to do in order to graduate. During the spring you will have to make a presentation of your work to a committee. The assessment is based on what we call "habits of mind."<P>	The first "habit" is Viewpoint. Can you take a point of view (opinion) and argue for it? Can you see and discuss the viewpoints of others? Your reading (Book reviews) shows that you can recognize and enter into different points of view. You can sympathize with Rigoberta's point of view. Your reflections show that you can state your own perspective on an issue. I do not yet see anything that shows you can discuss the viewpoints of others.<P>	The second habit is Connections. Does your work have coherence, or internal connections? Does your work show that you see the connections within a topic? and between any topic and the larger world around us? This is an area in which I think you have always been strong. Last year's portfolio showed that you were able to make the connection between the learning you were doing and the world around you. This year's portfolio continues to show that strength. The "Still I Rise" exhibition shows that you can connect things that you have learned around the common theme of freedom. You also make poetic connections by using the common refrain of "Still I Rise." Your writing generally has internal coherence (Meaning, your writing is logically organized). You also make connections between what happens and how you learn, and we can see this in all of your reflection pieces, especially the Panel Speech.<P>	The third thing is evidence. How do you know what you know? How do you know it is true? You use evidence in your reflection pieces, and your work itself is the evidence that what you say about your work is true (or at least reasonable.) You include some evidence in the form of statistics in your math-science piece but you don't actually use it. How would the number of STDs affect the decision of the city council? What do these numbers have to do with the Bronx? Where do they come from anyway?<P>	Voice has to do with the impact of your language. Can you use language to make the impression you want to make? You have developed a personal voice. Your reflections tell a story in a clear and straightforward way. Your math/science proposal is also clear and reasonable. Your poem shows the development of an emotional voice that can paint pictures in language. In your book review of Disappearing Acts you say "I love the way she brings her characters to life by using the language we use nowadays." We have to bring our work to life by using the language that we use. It is not always everyday language. For example, you still need to develop an academic voice, one that you can use to deal with viewpoint and evidence.<P>	And Conventions is our last concern. While your writing has improved over the last year and a half you still have many things to work on. You need to work on them until they become automatic, just the way you always do things. You need to work on proofreading. In your cover letter you want to say "now a days" but you say "know a days." You say "pick up my space" instead of "pick up the pace." You often write "where" when you mean "were," and "there" instead of "their." (Math-science piece). And in the two pages of work (Math-Science) there are 8 misspellings. (Please banish "gonna" from your formal writing. Only in the mouth of a character, speaking everyday language - Please!) Your use of written English has improved. In your folder I see progress and effort. I point these things out to you so you can work on them, master them and get them out of the way.<P>	Using these criteria, your portfolio is less than satisfactory (see the grading sheet in the folder). Your advisor will help you work out what you need to do next. You should be proud of your work and progress. Keep rising.<P>									Best always,<BR>									    Nancy<P><HR WIDTH=65%>10th-grade portfolio scoresheets: ORAL PRESENTATION and HABITS OF MIND <BR>[Reproduced below are the Habits of Mind and oral presentation scoresheets completed by the members of Jesselin's presentation committee, whom she addressed in the spring of her tenth-grade year.]<P><B>Committee Member Rick Levine, Advisor:</B><P><BR><B>Oral Presentation: </B><P> <BR>	Excellent - 5<P><BR>Comments:  Jesse spoke clearly and strongly about her work.

She persuasively demonstrated that she understood that issue of viewpoint.  She could easily demonstrate that she could make connections both in the work that she presented and in spontaneous discussion after the presentation.  Her evidence here is her work itself.  Her Kenya discussion was well grounded in the awareness of different sources (We have no documentation of the sources themselves). Her knowledge of female circumcision may be limited to the present-day situation. She misunderstands voice to be the speaking voice of a public presentation (at which she excelled).

Teachers also enlist one another's help and work together, usually by subject area, to develop units. All liberal arts and sciences courses are integrated into the two interdisciplinary subject areas of Humanities and Math/Science, both of which are taught in daily two-hour blocks. In addition, each morning students take a two-hour block of Spanish, which is taught by an adjunct staff member. <P>	Classes at FLHFHS are heterogeneous and include special education students - for most activities - and a large group of Limited English Proficiency students. Currently, only the school's Division I program, for students in the ninth and tenth grades, is in effect. A Division II program is slated for implementation in 1996, and will consist of a course of study geared towards preparing 11th- and 12th-grade students (who will also be grouped heterogeneously) to complete graduation portfolios. Soon, Fannie Lou Hamer will be a complete four-year high school of no more than 400 students total. <P>	The Language Portfolios represent a two-year process which allows teachers and students to: 1) examine student literacy skills in the ninth grade; and 2) evaluate those skills in the tenth grade, based upon the Habits of Mind (see <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="vision.HTM">VISION</A>). A satisfactory Portfolio (a minimum of 14 points out of a possible 20) is necessary for progression to Division II.	<P>	In developing a new school, the teachers who designed the Language Portfolio decided to focus on "building a portfolio culture in the lower grades." Because the school has portfolio requirements for graduation, preparing students for this system has been essential. Developmentally, students consider the Language Portfolios to be central to their experience at Fannie Lou Hamer.  <P><B>THE LANGUAGE PORTFOLIO</B><P>The Language Portfolio is a 2-year long process. In the ninth grade, Portfolios are reviewed in January and May. In tenth grade, students assemble their Language Portfolios in January. They then have the whole schoool year to improve upon, revise, or otherwise change Portfolio work in order to meet established Benchmark Standards (see "Conferences and Portfolio Defenses" in CONTEXT). A student can select work completed over the course of either semester for inclusion in the Language Portfolio - a culminating collection of work which is evaluated by the student him- or herself and one or more teachers.  <P>	Language Portfolio pieces are selected to fit certain categories of language development: writing, reading, and speaking. Throughout each semester, students engage in work-related Exhibitions, which they draw upon when compiling their Portfolios. Students write a cover letter reflecting on the work included in their Language Portfolios. Every staff member at FLHFHS reads a number of Portfolios and writes a response letter to the student about his or her work and reflections. 9th-grade students receive a response letter from a teacher who has reviewed their work, but 9th-grade Language Portfolios are not given an overall grade. 10th-grade Portfolios, on the other hand, are graded; by the 10th grade, a satisfactory Language Portfolio and oral presentation of this Portfolio are required for entry to Division II. <P>  <B>CONSTRUCTING THE PORTFOLIO</B><BR>Students are given the guidelines sheet explaining the Language Portfolio at the beginning of the year (see PROMPT). In addition, teachers and advisors break down the portfolio process into components, which are then taught one at a time. For example, a teacher may have the whole class focus on which pieces to include for the writing section and how to reflect upon written work.  In this way, teachers are able to explain more deeply and concretely - through modeling - what is expected of each student, and can provide focused time for some students to catch up (some students will be ready to select pieces and revise them while others are still creating new work to go into their Language Portfolios.) Teachers at Fannie Lou Hamer are aware that many students have experienced failure in their previous educational settings. They reiterate the requirements for the Language Portfolio in class, and 10th graders provide peer instruction to the 9th graders, who are new to the portfolio process. The entry slips (see below) help students reflect on the work that they have done by asking specific questions about each piece included in the Language Portfolio, and provide a measure of organizing structure and reinforcement towards the portfolio process. <P><B>WRITING ENTRY SLIP:</B><P><OL><LI>  How you wrote it.<BR><LI>  Why you chose it.<BR><LI>  What important thing (or things) this shows about your writing.<P></OL><P><B>PUBLIC SPEAKING ENTRY SLIP:</B><BR><OL> <LI>  Describe the occasion.<BR><LI> Describe how you prepared for it.<BR><LI>  Describe what you learned about public speaking.<BR><LI>  Include any grades or comments or evaluation.</OL><P>	The Book Review Form asks for specific information about each book a student has read. Students are required to describe elements such as the setting, main characters, story conflict or problem, and the author's writing style. They are also required to give a brief recommendation for the book if they liked it, or, if they did not, to explain why this is so. <P>	Students work on their Language Portfolios during Humanities and Advisory periods. The checklist of required components lends structure to their work. Portfolio pocket folders are stored in accessible closets or cabinets, so students can get them on their own. Computer disks are kept in a separate file cabinet drawer and are used for finalizing and saving students' work throughout the year.  <P>	 A typical classroom scenario: Each student at a table has chosen something different from the others to include in his or her Language Portfolio. David has written a math/science piece, one student reads a classmate's poem, and Jarvin reflects on his oral presentation. Several students are at the computers working on cover letters.  The teacher, Rick, moves around the room, explaining what needs to be included and helping students figure out which pieces can be used for which category. "For the ninth graders," he says, "the first go around requires more pulling than any portfolio afterwards ... it's a retraining of how to think about one's work."<P>  	Nancy Mann, a Humanities teacher, goes over with her class the importance of writing cover letters - in which students reflect upon their work and progress - that are consistent with the pieces of work included in the Language Portfolio. She also posts deadlines on a white board in her classroom for the various parts of the Portfolio (for example, when the cover letter draft is due).<P> 	Each staff member at FLHFHS, including non-teachers, leads an advisory group of about 15 students. Groups will be mixed-age within each Division (i.e., ninth and tenth graders together; eleventh and twelfth graders together). Advisors will stay with the same group for two years. For teachers, advisees come from their own subject classes. Advisories meet four times a week for thrity minutes to an hour. Once a month, advisory groups meet for 11/2 hours to work on Portfolios (see below).<P>	Students are introduced to the portfolio process by their advisors, and initially work on their Language Portfolios once a month during Advisory periods. Work on January Language Portfolios shifts to Humanities class, where the teachers devote a concentrated amount of time towards helping students reflect on and assemble their Portfolio work. Work on May Portfolios is once again carried out in Advisory. Second-semester work time is especially important for tenth-grade students, who are preparing to deliver oral presentations of their Language Portfolios. <P>	Tenth-grade students who completed Language Portfolios as freshmen are often used as resources by other students. Several tenth-graders keep their last year's Language Portfolio with them. One tenth-grader, Marcha, comments, "Looking back to last year's portfolio is helpful." For their part, many ninth-grade students comment that this process is new to them, and very different from anything they'd done in Junior High School.<P><B>HUMANITIES CURRICULUM</B><P>Rick's interage 9th/10th-grade classroom greets those who enter with colorful bulletin boards, upon which pieces of student work from throughout the semester are displayed. Earlier in the year, students worked in teams to design posters for exhibitions about international rights issues. Teams chose to investigate one of several issues related to freedom: women's rights; ethnic diversity; land distribution; or colonialism and independence in China and Guatemala. Students learned about topics they didn't choose from their classmates' presentations, which everyone in the class was required to take notes on and respond to. <P>	As part of the Freedom Unit, students participate in reading workshops where they read Rigoberta Menchu's autobiography in English or Spanish and examine the issues of freedom raised by her life. As a follow-up, students write a letter to the author about parts of her story that touch them, or learn about another Guatemalan freedom fighter through Amnesty Inter-national and write to a Guatemalan official about the human rights issues pertinent to the case. These letters are regarded as writing samples; as such, they require several drafts and are often included in Language Portfolios as process pieces. <P>	In other parts of the Humanities curriculum, two classes of students work on original poetry with a Poet-in-Residence sponsored by Americorps. This past year, Sandra Maria Esteves came to FLHFHS three times each week to conduct an hour-long poetry workshop. Students engage with this form of expressive writing, and poems can be included in Language Portfolios under the categories of "Your Choice" or "Process Piece."<P>  	A second literature component of the Humanities curriculum for Semester I of this year  involves students reading MacBeth as a whole class, taking turns reading parts, and analyzing the play together. In addition, a production of the play is put on, for which each classroom acts out one scene. The work from this unit on MacBeth can be included in Language Portfolios reviewed at the end of Semester II as examples of either writing, reading, or public speaking.<P><B>CONFERENCES AND PORTFOLIO DEFENSES (10th Grade)</B><P>Language Portfolios are discussed with parents at conferences. Parents come in and meet with their child and his or her advisor to review report cards, which are given out four times a year. 	When a tenth-grade student is ready to defend his or her final revised Language Portfolio, a Portfolio presentation meeting is held. The attendees include either a family member or person of the presenting student's choosing, along with two teachers and a 9th-grade student. These meetings are typically scheduled from the beginning of April to the end of the school year. Forms are used by each person at the Language Portfolio presentation meeting to assess the presenting 10th grade student. One form follows a rubric designed to evaluate the oral presentation of the student's Language Portfolio, while another represents an overall Language Portfolio score based upon the Habits of Mind rubric scoresheet (see <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="evaluate.HTM">EVALUATION</A>). <P>	Tenth-grade students must present a satisfactory Language Portfolio to qualify for entry to Division II. At a family "benckmark conference," the student's advisor meets with the student and a family representative to determine the student's readiness for Division II. If the student is not considered ready for Division II, the conference develops a plan for the student's continued work in Division I. The staff approves all plans and certifies the student's transition to Division II. <P>The Benchmark Standards considered in the conference are: <OL><LI>Language Portfolio;<LI> Final Exhibitions; <LI> two years of community service; <LI> Regents Competency Exams in math, reading, and writing; and <LI> two years of Spanish and the Spanish Proficiency Exam.</OL></BODY> </HTML>

In preparation for their research, students learn about the sun, the earth, and the moon (see Context).<P>	At the beginning of the students' investigation of their chosen planet, Ms. Calone assigns two questions that have to be answered: How long is a day on your planet?  How long is a year on your planet? Students also generate questions, and answer them with facts they uncover. At least nine facts are required for the final poster. <P>	This year, students review excellent posters made by Wading River Elementary School students in their own Planet Poster Investigation Project. Reproduced below is the rubric Ms. Calone's class developed collectively, after determining the criteria for excellent work based on the posters they saw, as well as the criteria for other levels of quality (good, okay, needs work) in their peers' and their own products.<P><HR><B>POSTER RUBRIC</B><BR><B>TITLE</B><UL><LI>Needs Work (1) - Your title is too small.

Historically, the Investigation Project has been done with sixth-year students only, but beginning this year the Project will also be done at the fifth-year level. Some modifications are being made to address the needs of the younger students.<P>	Manorhaven has heterogeneously grouped classes. Twenty-one percent of the students receive English as a Second Language instruction. Although the district has eliminated most self-contained special education classes, the Investigation Project has been done with a 5th/6th-grade special education class.in the past. This class teamed up with Mr. Grande, the teacher whose sixth-year class is profiled here, and his students for the entire Project.<P>	The Investigation Project began in 1981 with discussions including Dr. Welles, then a language arts coordinator, and other teachers in the East Williston School District about their process of inquiry. The goal of these educators was to translate their personal and professional experiences into a curriculum for children, in much the same way as those who originated the process of teaching writing drew on the experiences of real-world writers to do so.<P>	The idea behind the Investigation Project was that the principles involved in teaching writing could also be applied to the research process. In this spirit, Dr. Welles explains the importance of "giving students on-going instruction and response throughout the research process rather than waiting to respond to a final product; slowing down the process; giving chunks of time during the school day to work rather than making it an at-home assignment only; and designing structures for students to help one another."<P>  	After the philosophy and initial design of the Investigation Project had been established, teachers who implemented the original Investigation curriculum refined it as their students' experiences with the Project indicated where more or less structural support was needed.<P> 	Manorhaven's current teachers also work at improving the Project. Mr. Grande, for his part, continually refines the Investigation Project curriculum by creating structures to support each student and his or her individual learning style. For example, to help a student who writes reluctantly and has problems meeting deadlines, Mr. Grande established a system of regular communication with the child's parents at the beginning of the Investigation Project.<P><B>Student Ownership and Topic Selection</B><P>The first thing students realize about the Investigation Project is that they are in charge. <BR><BR> Dr. Welles gives an initial lesson in the school's library to all three sixth-year classes, and explains both the Project and how students might generate topics. She facilitates an open-ended discussion - among students, teachers, librarian, and herself -- to get students thinking about themselves as researchers by asking internal questions such as: "What things do I like?" and "What things do I want to know more about?"<P>	Many students' topics reflect familial influences. For example, Samantha, a sixth-year student, began researching the New York Stock Exchange by interviewing her father, a former stock broker. Another student, Glenn, chose to study ham radio communication, which is a hobby of his father's.<P>	Dr. Welles models choosing and narrowing a subject of interest until it is manageable. One student originally selected the military as his subject of interest, which he soon realized was just too broad. With help from Dr. Welles, the school librarian Ms. Auerbach, and other students, Sean was able to narrow his topic to military aircraft, then to fighter planes. As he explained, 'the other [topics] just would have been too much for the reader."<P>	Though students typically progress at markedly different rates - some write "feverishly" while others remain stuck in figuring out how they want to begin and what type of lead they want to write - Mr. Grande reassures his students of their knowledge and expertise. "These are your projects," he tells them. "You are the expert. You know more than I do about your subject.  You have to convince your readers of what you've learned." Mr. Grande also tells his students that initially they should put down on paper whatever comes into their heads.<P>  <B>Forming Authentic Questions and Providing Models</B><BR><BR>At the beginning of the eleven-week Investigation Project, the class uses a block of about sixty minutes per day to work on related lessons, some of which require the entire sixth year to converge in the library. As students become more involved in notetaking, Mr. Grande increases the amount of class time set aside for work on the Investigation Project, but divides this time into segments of about 45 minutes in the morning and 45 minutes in the afternoon.<P>	The creation of important research questions is the focus of several lessons in the first two weeks of the Investigation Project. In these lessons, students write what they already know about their topic; why they are interested in it; and how they have learned about it so far.  From here, students are asked to generate questions about their topic. To help them develop useful questions, Mr. Grande chooses a subject that no one in the class is studying, and with students' help, generates questions about it that he would want to research and answer.<P>	Samantha explains that one of the most important parts of the Investigation Project occurs at the very beginning, when students fill out what are referred to as Blue Sheets. "The Blue Sheet is where you write down all the questions you want answers to about your topic," she explains.  "Then in your rough draft, you make sure you've answered them." At the bottom of the Blue Sheet, students also list all possible resources to get information, and cross reference words to look up. <P>	Students are taught how to use INFOTRAC, the card catalogue, indices, and the reader's guide to periodicals. They are also asked to think about both print and non-print media, including human resources, in order to challenge preconceived notions of where information can be found.<P><B>Taking Notes and Organizing Information</B><BR><BR>Each student has a box on his or her desk where notecards are kept. Students learn to put only one fact on a notecard, along with a code or symbol for the source, and the page number where the information was found. A key card delineates bibliographic references.<P>	Ms. Auerbach, the librarian, plays a key role in this team-taught, information-gathering and notetaking part of the Investigation Project. She helps students weed out important from extraneous data, and determine which pieces of information they collect are useful. In addition, she coordinates trips to other libraries, including the middle school and public libraries; teaches students about the computerized resources available to them in school and at other libraries; brings in resources from other places; and discusses individual student needs with teachers.<P>	One of the unique ways students obtain information for their Projects is by writing letters and interviewing people over the phone or in person. If students are sent pictures, these are often used in students' final presentations, while useful textual information gets transformed into notecards for the final report. Mr. Grande requires each student to write a minimum of five letters, hoping that they will get responses from at least three. A model lesson is given on how to write a business letter and address an envelope. <P>	After the students have been researching their subjects for 6-8 weeks and have amassed most of the notecards they will ultimately use, they sit down with and "teach" a partner. Without using their notes, the new teachers speak about what they have learned thus far, and reveal the information they found most interesting. The "students" ask questions to uncover areas requiring more investigation or greater clarification.<P><B>Student Writing and Visuals</B><BR><BR>"What do I use?" "What do I include?" "How do I include it?" These are among the "burning questions" students are expected to consider once they are ready to write their drafts. The Blue Sheet of questions students compile while researching their topics enables them to go back and look at what they wanted to learn when they began their investigations. The questions lend structure to the final research paper by helping students choose what information to include or leave out.<P>		Mr. Grande and the principal demonstrate how to write leads. They provide examples of different writers' usage of anecdotes and other audience-grabbing strategies. From here, the serious process of writing first drafts takes two to three weeks. According to Mr. Grande, almost every child completes a first draft on time. Of this year's batch, he says, "80% were good first drafts while the other 20% had to be significantly reworked. So, we sat down and had one-on-one meetings with the students who were struggling - this included involving the resource room teacher and trying to give them some specific pointers and strategies."<P> 	During the draft-writing period, approximately 1 hour each day is allotted for students to write from their notecards, which they have already organized and categorized, and to meet with a partner or the teacher to work through any difficulties. Students also view Investigation Projects from years past to expose them to many different presentation formats, topics, and kinds of projects, and to help them recognize good work. Mr. Grande explains that "some [of the older Investigation Projects] were very good, some were not so good.  And the kids were able to make very good judgments about that." The principal, Dr. Welles, describes this part of the process as "helping kids set standards for themselves."<P> 	After they write their drafts, students are encouraged to think about what visuals they might create to engage the viewer and accompany their written work. Suggestions include breaking up the text with a chart or picture or creating a three-dimensional model. Peer conferences help students broaden their understanding of what readers need. Sean, who is writing about fighter planes, plans to include in his Investigation Project a huge collage made from images of fighter planes, and a model of a jet which he constructed.<P><B>Final Presentation: 'Author's Tea'</B><BR><BR>Students have a week after handing in their final papers to make necessary corrections or revisions. At the end of this week, when all the Investigation Projects are completed, each sixth-year class is given time in the library for their "author's tea." At the author's tea, the sixth-year students celebrate their accomplishments. They also read one another's work and make positive comments. Each project has an author, title, and a subject catalogue card. Some of the projects have large visuals, which are displayed throughout the library, and each child has a "mailbox" - an envelope with his or her name on it, into which viewer/reader comments can be put. The Investigation Projects are kept on display in the library for an entire month or more, so that peers, teachers, administrators, parents, board members, and others can examine them and put notes into the corresponding authors' mailboxes. <P>	So that all of Manorhaven's students are able to view the Investigation Projects, the librarian, takes each grade, K-6, to the library during a regularly scheduled library period. Once there, students explore all of the displays, and write a responsive comment to at least one Investigation Project, which then gets placed in the appropriate mailbox. Should this visit prove insufficient, time-wise, to satisfy the younger students'curiosity about the Investigation Projects, they may return to the library during an "open library time" to re-visit the projects and possibly write more comments. So that parents might view the work their daughters and sons have created, an evening celebration for the sixth-year students and their parents or guardians is scheduled.<P>  <HR></BODY> </HTML>

This is because his report is a comic, or a "series of pictures that tell a story." The tale he tells with his comic is the very story of comic books: what they are; where and when they originated; when they became popular; how they evolved; and how they"re developed, among other things.<P>	The first part of Asa's report deals with the nature and origin of comics. The opening pages see the hero (presumably Asa) climb into a magic cab with fuzzy dice hanging from the rear-view mirror and piloted by an easygoing, dreadlocked cabbie. He instructs the driver to take him first to New York City, where he conducts several impromptu interviews with passersby to find out what a comic is, and then to the year 2000 B.C. (i.e., ancient Egypt), where he examines hieroglyphics and posits them as an example of a comic.<P>	The report next discusses the history of comic books, starting with the birth of the first one in 1911. Superman, the most popular comic book hero of all time, was created in 1927, thereby ushering in the "Golden Age" of comics. After this period came the Silver, Iron, Chromium, and Marvel Ages of comic books.<P>	The rise of Marvel comics, the most successful comic book company of all time, is outlined next, and textual and pictorial descriptions are provided of some of the early and more colorful Marvel characters - including Submariner, Human Torch, The Wizzer, The Vision, and "the ever-patriotic, star spangled, Captain America." During the Post-WWII Marvel Age of comics, the company's then-head editor Stan Lee created an entirely new generation of superheros that displayed human qualities. The Incredible Hulk, The Amazing Spiderman, and the X-Men all arose from this period.<P>	"Psst, hey kid you wanna know some inside info on the company that brought you Superman and Batman? Ok follow me," whispers a sunglassed, hatted man towards the end of Asa's report. The stranger is referring to D.C. comics, whose headquarters are located in New York City, where the hero has been returned by his trusty sidekick. His self-appointed mission: to infiltrate D.C.'s headquarters and find out how a comic book is actually made.<P>	The process of creating a comic book is highly involved, but orderly: <P>"At all companies the story comes first. Developing the story is usually a group effort of the editor, writer, and artist. The artist draws a rough draft of the comic book based on the writer's outline ... called a storyboard. After the writer, editor, and artist are satisfied ... the pages go back to the writer to come up with the exact words to go in the word balloons.<P>	"Next, comes a rough pencil dummy, to show the page layout ... then a final pencil drawing of each page is made. Then a photographic copy is made of that pencil drawing. Then the pages are ready for inking.<P>	"Ink artists go over the artist's work using permanent black ink. Then the pages go to a letterer who writes the words in the balloons.<P>	"Now the pages are ready to be colored. That is done by a separate color artist. Except for the cover everything is colored by computer. After that the comic goes to a production faculty to be printed."	The last page of Asa's comic sees the hero race home. Time has flown during his travels, and now he'll be late to meet his mom.<P><HR>	<BR><IMG SRC="page91.gif" ALT="copy of page 9"><P> <IMG SRC="pag101.gif" ALT="copy of page 10"><P><IMG SRC="pag111.gif" ALT="copy of page 11" ALIGN=BOTTOM><p><A HREF="PAGES.HTM">Click here to see these pages in their original sizes.</A><HR></BODY> </HTML>

Do you remember me?  I'm sorry that my letter is late.  So how are you doing?  How is your school?  Mine?  Well, it is o.k. but I have to take a Einglish test and a Chinese test.  It's not bad but I don't like it a lot.  My mom says that I'll need it when I grow up.  You're really lucky you know.  You get to learn English for free.  Next week, my teacher is going to tell me about which middle school I'm getting into.  We have several middle schools, because we have fifty students in one class and twelve classes for one grade.  We elect a class president twice a year.  It's good to be a class president but I always lose. and I feel bad and sad about it and sometimes it's not so good to be a class president.  because you have to help the teacher a lot don't get to spend time with your friends in school.<P>Did I ever tell you that you're lucky?  Well, If I didn't, you're really lucky.  no school at Saturdays, you have gyms and you have caferteria!  My school doesn't even have a gym and a caferteria and in Korea you always have to go to school in Saturdays.<P><P>My teacher always tells us to write a diary.  Everybody has to show it to the teacher.  I don't like it. because it's private to me.  <P>You know that we have lots of kids in one class.  I don't even remember my class mates' names!

How are you doing?  I'm fine. thanks for writing back to me. I'm glad that you like your school and everything.<BR>You know. Yesterday was my grandfather's 60th birthday which people calls it Hwan-Gap.  It's really a big celebration. We celebrated about my grandfather's past.  I heard a lot about his stories.  Like when he lost his twin brother in the Koream War.  I really liked his party.  but my mom didn't.  She had to work for the whole day!  And next week is my grandfather's brother's 70th birthday!  It's almost as big a celebration as his 60th birthday too.  The 70th birthday is called 'KOH' and the most exciting day is the 100th day after a child's birth.  It's like a birthday party.  but people give rings instead of presents and the babies' parents make a necklace out of it. and it's really nice.  My mom said she will give it to me when I'm old enough.  I don't know when It's going to be though.  Do you have one too?  ask your mom O.k.!<BR><BR>I hope to hear from you soon.<BR>Bye<BR>Your friend<BR>Jeung-Eun<BR><HR><P><B>LETTER THREE: THANKSGIVING</B><P>Dear: Seung-Hyun<BR>Hi! How are you?  I'm good.  Do you know why?  Because yesterday was Thanksgiving!  It's really good to see the whole family get together and make special rice cakes called 'songpyon'.  I like to make rice cakes and we visit the ancestral tomb and clean the area of the tombs and we pay our respects.<P>By the way, Thanksgiving is 'chusok' in Korean.  Which means harvest moon too. because chusok is the 15th day of the eight moon by the lunar calendar.  So on the night of 'chusok' we went out side and we made wishes. the we gather around and do th kanggangsuwollae!  Kanggangsuwollae is a traditional circle dance and It's performed under the full moon to celebrate the chusok.  We don't stay up all night though.  We all have to go to sleep before midnight.<P>It's a tradition, and the next morning we eat special foods.  When I met my grandfather's brother's family, they gave me money!  Oh.  I just love Thanksgiving anyway!  Do they have a Thanksgiving in america?  Please tell me about it.  I really like to know.

Then I had to write an essay about rice.<BR>Here are some of the things I learned<BR><OL><LI> Lots of people work really hard to get rice<BR><LI> The rice is the main dish for Korean people.  I don't think I like rice Because I eat it every single day.  So I don't feel any thing about it.  And the kinchi.  It's hot and spicy.  And my mom nad her friends do the kimjang together.  Oh, kimjang means make kimchi for the winter  Then you dig a hole on the ground and keep the kimchi in the hole.  It tastes really good.  You tasted it before right?  Does your mommake kimchi?  Please write me back.  I'll wait for it. O.K.?<P></OL>Good Bye<BR>Sincerely,<BR>Jung-Eun<BR><HR><P><B>LETTER SEVEN: SPORTS DAY</B><P>Dear: Seung-Hyun<BR>Hello!  How are you? I'm angry You know why?  Because Today was sports day in school. Sixth graders were divided into girls and Boys. We made 2 teams for each class  The One team of girls and one team for boys.  My class boys were playing soccer and we were playing kickball and we lost. Then we played soccer while the boys playied basket ball.  We did our best but we lost again!  Everyone was so angry  Then we playied volley ball and we lost again.  So we were the last place team.  We were all angry and tired.  But everyone got notebook even though we were in last place.  And everyone was happy about that.  We didn't do any class work!

How are you doing? Today I learned about the family and Houses in the old days. We talked about the changes. Do you want to know? O.K. Did you know that the bathroom was outside of your house in the old days? I can't even imagine it! I'm sure that I wouldn't like it.  In old days the houses was usually shaped like L or U.<BR>The family in old days were large.  But today, people live in brick houses or high-rise apartment and we have bathrooms in our house.  but I think the bad thing about living in apartment is you can't make any noise and you can't run in the house because the neighbors could call the super visor!<BR>We don't have large families anymore, we have families called 'The Nuclear Family'.  Nuclear family means only the parents and their children live together.  My family is a Nuclear Family too, because we don't live with our grand parents.  Is your family a nuclear family too?  I'll write you again!<BR><BR>Good Bye,<BR>Yours Truly<BR>Jung-Eun<BR><HR><P> <B>LETTER NINE: FACTS ABOUT KOREA</B><P>Dear: Seung-Hyun.<BR>Hello!  What's up?  I'm really great!

South Korea is 99,200 km2  big and 70% are mountainous.  And the U.S.A. is 95 times bigger than South Korea.  Really small, Huh?  Korea has about 45 million people and South Korea is 25th in world population.  U.S.A. has 6 times the population of South Korea.  I don't know if those facts are interesting to you.  But to me, It really is interesting.  I lived in South Korea for 12 years and I knew nothing about it!  Now I feel that I'm really Korean. Why don't you try to learn it too?  It's really good and Cool!  Just Give it a try. O.K.?<P>Good Bye<BR>Love,<BR>Jung-Eun<BR><HR><P><B><CENTER>POSTCARD FOUR: HANSHIK</CENTER></B><P>Dear: Seung-Hyun<BR>Hello!

It's the special day you don't cook anything.  You eat only cold foods, and hot water.  It's the day when the whole family gets together and it's the day when everyone gets to go to the mountains and plant trees and flowers.

Both parents and students receive letters from the school's principal and sixth-year teachers, detailing the stages and goals of the Project. In addition, students are given a checklist delineating the tasks they will be undertaking (see below).<P><H3>Parent Letter</H3><P>Dear Parents,<BR>	The sixth-year classes are presently engaged in the process of inquiry. Each student has been given the opportunity to select a topic of his/her choice, and that interest will serve as the vehicle for learning and using research skills. We feel you should understand the goals and expectations of this Investigation Project.<BR>	One important goal of this project is for students to see the significance of research and research skills in their own lives. We also expect their concept of research to expand beyond "library research" and beyond the narrow focus of a particular school-assigned "report."  They will investigate through direct experiences with people, places, and things as well as indirect experiences with media, books, periodicals, newspapers, and discussion.<P>		Skills to be stressed during this investigation include:<P><UL><LI> Selecting and delimiting a subject<LI> Asking questions<LI> Selecting appropriate resources<LI> Discovering and using specific reference tools<LI> Selecting main ideas; what is important/relevant and what is not<LI> Learning to read first, take notes later; how to take notes without copying from a text<LI> Organizing, categorizing information and ideas<LI> Synthesizing and presenting the results of investigation in written form</UL><P>		Throughout the project, we will provide opportunities in class for students to have the same kind of peer and teacher feedback on their inquiry process and products as they have in the Writing Workshop, with the expectation that students will draft, revise, edit and proofread their final products.<P>	This is a major project which requires much of your child. You can be of help by assisting in the area of resources. For example, some students will arrange to do first-hand research through visits to factories, museums, local businesses, etc. Parents can assist by providing transportation. Should these visitations occur during school hours, it will be your child's responsibility to bring in a note from you and to complete any class work or homework that is missed.<P>	Your child may also need your help to get to a public library. Locating and collecting "people-resources" is another task with which students are likely to need assistance.<P>	In providing support, help your child become an independent investigator. An important aspect of this process for each student is to clarify thinking by talking with others about the subject under investigation. As parents, you can best help your child by listening and asking questions.<P><H3>Student Letter</H3><P>Dear Student:<BR>	Attached you will find an "Investigation Checklist." As you can see, there are many tasks for which you are responsible. The process by which you achieve your final product is at least as important as the product itself.  It will be your responsibility to have each task checked by a teacher, signed and evaluated. Therefore, as you complete each task, be sure to get a teacher's evaluation. Don't forget to pay attention to due dates. Unless your teacher has checked, signed, and evaluated all of the tasks, your work for each week will be considered incomplete.<P>P.S.  This checklist must be kept in your folder and you will submit it with your folder at the completion of the Investigation Project.<P><H4>Student Evaluation Checklist</H4><P>Whenever a student completes one of the tasks involved in an Investigation Project, the date, teacher's signature, and his or her evaluation/comments are filled in during a teacher-student conference. These conferences occur throughout the duration of the Project. Below is a list of the tasks involved in an Investigation Project. (See<!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="context.HTM"> CONTEXT</A> to learn more about these tasks.)<P>Four Questions Sheet<BR>Blue Sheet Completed: (questions, cross reference words, resources)<BR>Log - first check:  (up to date, specific)<BR>Evidence of public library visit<BR>Resources: (at least three - at least one non-print)<BR>Completion of any intended: phone calls, letters, interview/trip arrangements<BR>Log - second check: (up to date, specific)<BR>Note Cards Begun: (at least 10-20 done according to instructions)<BR>Partner Interview: (shared information, listened, and responded helpfully to partner)<BR>Log - third check: (up to date, specific)<BR>Note Cards Completed<BR>Evidence of Organizing Scheme for Note Cards<BR>Draft Due (with entire investigation project folder)<BR>Conference with Partner<BR>Evidence of Revision<BR>Log Completed<BR>FINAL DRAFT: (including bibliography and entire investigation project folder)<HR><BR><HR></BODY> </HTML>

Although the teacher acts as primary evaluator to his or her students, much of the important feedback students receive comes from peers, outside visitors, and other school personnel who respond to students' work with notes in their mailboxes (see <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="context.HTM">Context</A>).<P> 	Mr. Grande evaluates students during the Project through observation and via the student evaluation checklist (see<!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="prompt.HTM"> Prompt</A>). He also conducts individual conferences with students, in which he reviews their journal entries.<P>	At the end of the Investigation Project, students assess their own performance, completing a self-evaluation sheet. Each student also receives a final evaluation from Mr. Grande, which indicates both areas of excellence and thoseareas or skills in which the student could improve. Mr. Grande uses a rubric to evaluate a student's performance on specific tasks according to one of three levels: Showing Strength, Actively Developing Skill, or Having Difficulty. To the final evaluations, he adds individualized letters in praise of each child's overall good work.<P>	During the time the projects are on display, Mr. Grande takes one or two home each night for evaluation. Evaluation of the Investigation Project is reflected in the language arts section of the report card for the grading period in which the Project is completed.<P><B>Final Evaluations</B><P><I>[Below are the final evaluations for Asa and Seung-Hyun, the students whose work was excerpted in performance.]</I><P><B><H3>Sample Evaluation #1: Asa</H3></B><P><B>Topic:  Comic Books</B><BR>Final Evaluation = Showing Strength on all tasks.<BR>Tasks:<BR><UL><LI>A.

<html> <head> <title>CES: Background: The Importance of Commitment - Sizer</title> </head> <body><hr> <h1><center>The Importance of Commitment</center></h1><hr> <center><h3>by Theodore R. Sizer<br> Chairman, Coalition of EssentialSchools<br> October, 1993</h3></center><hr>Inevitably, a report about the Coalition of Essential Schools is aboutoccurrences, about numbers and people and districts and dollars, about specifichappenings, all the important specifications of enterprises of this kind.<p>Our report gives cause both for satisfaction and concern - satisfaction thatsignificant progress has been made in the search for better schools for Americanchildren, and concern that much remains to be done, much remains to be known,much that we are now doing deserves continual review and adjustment.<p>Even nine years into the endeavor we are barely begun.  The start, however, hasbeen a happy one, full of promise.<p>Any report about "occurrences" - indeed, most reports of this nature - inevitablymask what we are <i>feeling</i>.  What we do can be chronicled; but how the moodand energy behind our work is evolving is more difficult to express, even toplumb.<p>I have learned, however, that these feelings are crucial.  Actions speak well. But the reasons for - the commitments to - such actions are the heart of it.  Itis such deep commitments, whatever the particular form in which they at some timeare played out, that will endure from our collective work.<p>What of these felt commitments?  What can I today "report"?<p>While school people are used to it and only episodically complain, many know thatthey control far too little of that for which they are held responsible.  Thezigging and zagging of policy; the comings and goings of superintendents andgovernors, each with a "new program"; the interruption of all routines over asingle "crisis" such as an asbestos scare of the imposition of some new test;most of all, the endless ambiguities about funding, about whether the schoolbudget will be cut or not, whether the new retirement scheme will or will notapply, whether new appointments can be made, whether new books or furniture canbe purchased, whether the school will have 1,500 kids or 2, 200 kids... the listin most Essential school communities is very long.  In many situations it is awonder, really, that schools keep at all.<p>The feelings of our colleagues about this bureaucratic chaos?  Resignation. Gallows humor.  Periodic rage, particularly when those primarily responsible forcausing the chaos speak of school-level professionals in patronizing, ignorant,and condescending ways.  Deeper though, there are doubts, doubts whether agovernmental system that tolerates such mismanagement without any apparentembarrassment is government worthy of its people, government fit to deliver onits profound promise to operate excellent schools when it insists with the forceof law that all children attend such schools.  The distress is deep here andrarely voiced.  We should be troubled by it, and troubled that those in positionsof power in government seem so unaware of it.<p>There is another emotion, one very close to home, one which I share.  It arisesfrom the fact that many of the routines with which we as teachers live do notsquare with what we know about human learning or, in fact, with common sense. The rushed "periods," the endless talk that we engage in to get things "covered"in class, the superficial testing with which we peg our students, theintellectual chaos of our curricula: we live with these wobbly old routines eventhough we know we should not live with them.  It is as if we were heavy cigarettesmokers, aware of the risks of our practice but stubbornly cleaving to it.  Wecompromises mightily, and hate ourselves for it.<p>These painful feelings arise because we are not just redesigning but<i>rethinking</i> a substantial portion of our very craft.  New ideas are easy. Shedding old ideas is tough.  Building a new routine is difficult.  Droppingcomfortable old routines, one which we feel that we are, within theirlimitations, "good at," is fiercely difficult.  Living with that contradictiondrains us.  We get defensive.  We want to hear about successes, about what wehave contributed, about our worthiness.  The awareness that we can do better bydoing some things differently gnaws at us, even as we wish not to talk of it.  Isense this feeling in many of us, particularly the most proud.  The best knowthat such feelings are the necessary and even happy prelude to the freedom of newand better practice.<p>I sense a marvelous mix of apprehension and satisfaction over the creating ofExhibitions and their cousins.  Such creation requires talk among teachers andprincipals, talk about substance and standards, talk rarely risked in the past. When the Exhibitions are ultimately held, there is more talk, talk about kids,about the standards to which they might be held, about how the students can behelped to do well in the future.  The talk - the collegiality - is for many abalm, a lift, even as it is punctuated by disagreements over the work of studentsand the nature of Exhibitions.  I sense the pleasure coming out of this hardwork.  It is collegiality with a serious purpose, not "collegiality" merely forthe sake of "getting together."  There is warmth here.  I sense it when hearingprincipals and teachers and students collectively describe their schools.  Thereis knowledge about their shared work, deep understanding.  For many that is new,and valued.<p>And there is jubilation when kids "do what they are not expected to do," producepowerful work, see the interestingly unfamiliar in the familiar.  This is themost exquisite feeling, and the easiest to observe.  Whether in cold Yankee orreserved Southern or informal Western demeanors, pride is difficult to hide.<p>Up or down, these feelings among many of my Coalition friends are deeply felt. In schools that are substantively moving, there is a sense of intensity, ofdeeply engaged argument.  It is never all hearts and flowers: the tensions areoften palpable, even to a casual visitor.<p>It is the depth of these feelings - their constructive intensity - that to mecharacterizes so much our collective effort.  There is no triviality in the bestof the work.  It is sincere and fundamental.  No report can easily describe it. Of all that we have accomplished over the last nine years, nothing more than thisgives a greater sense of optimism that our convictions about better schooling, abetter shake in this life for children, will endure.<p><hr><a href="backgrou.htm">Return to the Background page.</a> <p></body> </html>

<html><head><TITLE>CES: Publications: Horace: 5-3: Getting Started In an Essential School Program</TITLE></head><body><hr><center><h1> Getting Started In an Essential School Program</h1></center> <center>Volume 5, Number 3<BR> March 1989</center><hr>                                   For schools beginning to move towards adopting the principles of the Coalitionof Essential Schools, the first steps are often the most daunting. How can a fewinterested people gain the support of an entire staff for a change that willultimately affect the whole school? How much money will it take to get started,and where will it come from? How should the idea be presented to the community?Perhaps most important of all, at what pace and within what scope should thechange take place?<P>   Most schools who have gone through this process agree that a good twelvemonths of planning should precede the first day of classes in an EssentialSchool. To analyze how those months might best be spent, we spoke with people atHope Essential High School in Providence, Rhode Island; Walbrook High School inBaltimore, Maryland; Thayer High School in Winchester, New Hampshire; ParkwaySouth High School in Manchester, Missouri; and several other schools at variousstages and levels of the start-up experience.<P><hr><h2>Envisioning Goals</h2><hr>Many veterans agree that the first step in planning an Essential School isarriving at a vision of the school's purpose-its expressly stated goals for whatits students learn, how they learn it, even what kind of people they strive tobecome. Without such a basic vision, any discussion of educational means willfounder; with it, a school may survive an almost unlimited number of roughpassages. Many schools, therefore, begin their planning year with thoroughgoingstaff discussions, both to define an educational mission and to decide how itfits with the Coalition's common principles. A variety of decisions about thenature and structure of the program can emerge from these.<P>   One way to shape such a discussion is to ask specifically what skills astudent must display in order to graduate from the school. For example, if aschool's goals include mastery in depth of certain key intellectual skills, andmany of its students fall short of the literacy and numeracy needed to attainthis, an intensive tutorial program might be structured into the program. Or ifa school wants students to graduate with a sense of decency in relation to theirpeers and their community, it might structure a community service requirementinto its program.<P>   Beginning with a focus on the student's eventual mastery is one way to raiseissues of how to teach best; but such issues can come up in other ways as well.Concern for a more personal connection between teacher and student, forinstance, might drive a school's decision to lower teaching loads by adopting aninterdisciplinary approach. Or the same result might be reached simply because afaculty has a strong philosophical commitment to a unified or stripped-downcurriculum. From these decisions, it is natural to consider team teaching orteam planning as a structural possibility. In short, it is no accident thatschools in the Coalition display widely divergent solutions to the challengesposed by its nine common principles. In fact, in almost no case do two schoolsdevelop along an identical path or wind up in the same place. Variations amongCoalition schools are so essential as to almost qualify as a tenth principle.<P>   One predictable sticking point in these early developments, it appears, isthe way in which a new Essential School program is seen within the context ofthe whole school. Is it to be a contained alternative program in a school with atraditional curriculum for the majority of its students? Or will it start as asmall pilot project intended to encompass the entire school in time? The way inwhich a school answers this question appears to have a great deal to do with itssuccess. Problems with schools that limit themselves to a "school-within-a-school" structure have become so common that the Coalition now asks applicantsto pledge "whole-school" involvement over the long term.<P>   The amount and kind of staging that goes into an Essential School's start-upvaries greatly depending on what resources a school can call on. In the case ofHope High School, the proximity of the Coalition staff and the involvement ofthe education department at Brown University encouraged a liaison early on amongschool administration, the teachers union, the university, and the city'scentral school department. Reading over the records of their early discussionsone is struck by the sense of careful and detailed administrative negotiatingfrom the earliest stages. At the highest levels, the city's school departmenttalked with Brown about working together; various schools were considered aspossibilities for an Essential School program; and as talks progressed, theteachers union wielded firm control over how such a plan might affect itsteachers' rights. By the time the program took effect, the Hewlett Foundationhad paid for a full year of planning time for head teacher Albin Moser and half-years for the four starting teachers. Brown's "clinical professors," also partlypaid for by that grant, were working directly in the schools to support facultyas they practiced new teaching styles. And every aspect of the arrangement, fromwho would teach in the program to what would happen if one teacher took onanother's responsibilities, was spelled out in a strong union contract.<P>   Hope, then, approached its future as an Essential School in a way designed tolet it thrive within a structure carefully specified in advance. At NewHampshire's Thayer High School, in contrast, principal Dennis Littky simply sawimportant areas of agreement between Ted Sizer's principles and the way hisschool was already working, and gave them free play to develop as they wouldamong his staff. "Once we know what our goals are, my only criterion forevaluating the program is how well it meets those goals," says Littky. "Ifsomething we try doesn't work, we keep trying different approaches until itdoes." Once his staff was clear on its philosophy of team teaching, for example,Littky encouraged any number of ways teachers could carry it out.<P>   It is tempting to see Littky's confidence as a luxury of the small school-Thayer has only 300 students-with a strong principal who can make things work byvirtue of personality and elbow grease alone. As long as Thayer's teachers areguided by Essential School principles, they have freedom to try almost any newidea to see if it works-a stance that encourages continual intellectual and evenstructural ferment, but which it is easy to imagine might founder in a largersystem with more administrative restraints. Yet Littky's emphasis on his entireschool working together in this way came about partly because Thayer is toosmall and its budget to modest for any split in its school vision to bepractical. Moreover, Thayer's Essential School program has continued to growagainst a backdrop of a sometimes divided school board and community. Littkykeeps his momentum in part because his problem-solving technique does achievethe results he aims for. (Thayer's statistics for dropouts, attendance, andcollege admission have improved dramatically in the seven years since he washired.) This has its own effect, in turn: teachers at Thayer, whose salaries arelow by state standards, are said by one researcher to virtually ignore theunion, taking their satisfaction from intense work on a shared mission in anatmosphere of camaraderie and mutual respect.<P>   A small example here is revealing of an element common in many successfulstart-ups, in schools of many sizes. When Dennis Littky was first hired, heinterviewed each one of Thayer's teachers to get their sense of the school.(Over the course of that first summer, he met with each student as well.) "Iasked them what their dreams were and their hates, what was important to themabout their classes," Littky recalls. "The one thing they had in common was thatthey all hated study halls." The first change Littky made was to abolish thestudy hall. This seemingly minor change made possible a chain of importantstructural consequences, including longer class periods, which in turn affectedteaching styles, and so forth.<P><hr><h2>Who "Owns" the Change?</h2><hr>The point is that teachers saw their own perceptions of what was good forstudents listened to and carried out on a program level. The change belonged tothem, and so it began to work, laying the foundation so that the process couldcontinue. This question of who "owns" the change is probably the central factorin a school's success or failure as it starts up a new program.<P>   If the impetus for change comes from above-from a principal orsuperintendent, for example, or from state or city initiative-it runs the riskof being perceived as a "top-down" initiative lacking the grass-roots support ofteachers and community. But early action like Littky's can clearly shift theinitiative so that any real changes take place from the bottom up. When thishappens successfully, the administration is viewed not as a dictator or enemybut as a facilitating partner providing money, support, and even inspiration andincentives for change.<P>   Teachers at Walbrook High School in Baltimore, for instance, might have takenumbrage if their principal, Sam Billups, had instituted the sweeping measures hedid in a different way. In the early 1980s Walbrook had all the problems of anurban school, and- prompted by a Ford Foundation grant and the encouragement ofthe Baltimore School Study Committee-Billups was ready to institute an EssentialSchool program one grade at a time. Though he had already begun some movestowards change, such as ninth-grade clustering, the principal knew that histeaching staff would require substantial training and development before theywere ready to take on the Coalition's challenges, and he worried that the newprogram would be seen as an elite for "the best and the brightest" teachers andstudents. To guard against this, he made HORACE'S COMPROMISE and other readingsavailable to every teacher on his staff. "We kept everyone informed on everymove right from the start," he says. "We invited everyone to meetings andreceptions. Some teachers volunteered for the program; in other cases, like inmath, we had to talk them into it. And for our starting team we looked not forstars but for mid-career teachers already on our staff." As the EssentialSchool's facilitator Billups named the popular and energetic Marian Finney,whose job heading the health ed department was about to be phased out.<P>   That first summer Billups and Finney gave a brilliant start to the lastingand innovative staff development for which Walbrook is now known. After aninitial training period at Brown University with Coalition staff, teachersreturned to Walbrook to practice their new theories in a two-week "lab school"specially created for 20 students who had to make up course work not completedthe previous year. The "invitational" atmosphere and the excitement of a newprogram made the experiment a surprising success, culminating in a banquet withstaff, students, and parents. The summer's work ended with two weeks ofintensive faculty planning for the year ahead, and two teachers were sent to anational conference on critical thinking.<P>   The summer institute, in shorter versions, has continued in the years since,as Walbrook moves more teachers and students into its steadily expandingEssential School program. But it is most instructive as an example of howBillups believes change must take place- by getting teacher after teacher,within the Essential School and outside it, to try out the concept of "studentas worker" with the committed support and training of the administration. Theprincipal's obvious pride in his staff, and his cheerful expectation that histeachers will succeed at their task, creates an atmosphere of optimism andenergy at Walbrook that suffuse the entire school. Ironically, Walbrook laborsthis year under multiple handicaps: last year the school was shut down on aday's notice for massive asbestos removal, and it functions this year with atruncated student population in a wing of another city high school far from moststudents' homes.<P>   Sam Billups's expectation of success on a larger scale is an intangible thatseems to characterize many of the more successful Essential School programs,both at the faculty level and with students. To avoid the implication of failurethat so often attaches to remedial programs, Walbrook goes out of its way tobuild remedial efforts into the basic structure of its program, for example,scheduling a tutorial time block at the start of every day as a matter ofcourse. And though the school must submit to city and state mandates for skillstesting, the school curriculum is arranged so that teachers can coach studentsto pass all required tests as early as possible, and then get on with developingcritical thinking skills. (At neighboring Forest Park High School, which isbeginning plans to become a Coalition school this semester, teachers wear tee-shirts on testing day emblazoned with the passing score.) Billups also resiststhe temptation to extract "quick hard data" from his program as sole proof thatit works. You can tell his Essential School students, he says, for theirarticulateness, their high self-concept, and their own high expectations oftheir teachers. "They're the ones that argue for half an hour when you try tosend them home," he says with wry pride.<P><hr><H2>How Students Are Selected</H2><hr>But is the high self-esteem in successful Essential School students a result ofthe program, or simply a reflection of selection criteria that weed out studentsunlikely to succeed? At Walbrook, a random selection procedure guaranteesagainst a biased selection; at Hope and many other schools, students must askfor inclusion. Any application requirement, some critics say, lowers thecredibility of "success measures" like low dropout rates, higher test scores,and higher college admission rates when they are compared with those in aregular school program. "Of course the Hope Essential School has higherattendance and parent involvement," says Marcia Reback, president of theProvidence teachers union. "The kids don't get into it if they have badattendance records, and anything with an application is going to require acertain amount of parental attention to start with."<P>   In Walbrook's pilot year students were selected by computer, though becauseof stringent state requirements special needs students were not included. ("Isee no reason the program couldn't handle them," Billups says, "if the statewould let us.") The second year, some students who especially requested the program were included along with the random selection; and in the third year Billups simply took all the ninth graders assigned by the city to his new location in the asbestos shakeup. "Some of them may not have fit in initially," he says, "but they're coming around. And no one views this as an elitist program." Because of this approach, Walbrook can point to its phenomenally low dropout rate in the Essential School with confidence that the program has earned it. "We're working within a family here," Billups says. "If a student is missing, someone misses him. I've had cases where one student talked another into coming back to school."<p>   When students must volunteer to join an Essential School program, some schools find, it tends to attract those who are not doing well in the "regular" program. Students who have already been earning top grades in a more traditional system, it seems, are sometimes threatened by the prospect of working in a scheme where there are no "right answers" to guarantee good marks. It is easy enough to imagine the scenario that principal Craig Larson describes at Missouri's Parkway South High School, where teachers volunteered for an Essential team only to find themselves in a demanding program skewed towards at-risk students without having chosen that task.<p>   Larson addressed this problem by moving to computer selection of students and deemphasizing the separateness of the Essential School. When teachers see Coalition principles as freely available for all to try, he says, they work together better and do not see each other in terms of conflicting interest groups. Like Billups, then, Larson encourages all his teachers to involve themselves in new methods like teaming, exhibitions of mastery, and so forth. "We have definitely learned the value of open discussions," he says.<p><hr><h2>Dealing with Resistance</h2><hr>How teachers react to a new Essential Schools program, of course, also depends on a range of other factors. The quality of the existing atmosphere in the school and the community is critical, for example. If a school has a history of bad relations among teachers, administration, parents, or school board, it starts off with several strikes against any new reform strategy. Compounding this may be a teaching staff that has seen reforms and principals come and go while they labor on in the classrooms. "Teachers can get pretty tired of experiments in education," says Providence union leader Marcia Reback. "No wonder they sometimes have the attitude of 'Wake me up when it's over.'"<p>   That problem is certainly at the heart of why Essential Schools proponents, like all political organizers, believe their programs must have strong grassroots support to succeed. One striking attribute of schools like Baltimore's Walbrook and Forest Park, where staff involvement appears broad, spirited, and wholehearted, is a sense that everyone involved has a deep stake in the results. When they decide that personal satisfaction or even survival is the prize, resistance gives way to energy and pride.<p>   Dennis Littky, who knows quite a bit about community resistance from a searing period of turmoil over his leadership in his small New Hampshire community, addresses these issues with the forceful pragmatism of a grassroots organizer. "The perception of the school by the community," he argues, "is just as important as what we're actually doing." As he launched his program at Thayer High School, Littky held weekly coffees for townspeople to tell him ("without letting them degenerate into too much complaining") what they thought of the school. "My aim was to make them feel as responsible for the school's success as I am," he says. "That way, if it fails, it's not just my failure."<p>   Littky is continually developing new ways to build that same sense of accountability and ownership among his staff and students. Over the year he likes to meet weekly for several hours, for example, with each one of his thirty teachers; he visits every class twice a week; and he often goes through a teacher's entire day with him. Once in a while he schedules a day of open office hours for students to talk with him. Every Friday he writes an informal memo to his staff, ruminating on current developments and listing what's planned for in the week ahead. And to start the last staff meeting he gave each teacher a bound "blank book" and asked them to write in it weekly for fifteen minutes about anything they chose to, for him to respond to in writing.<p><hr><H2>Dealing with Change</H2><hr>One point of all this groundwork, of course, is that a program might continue even if its initial leader leaves. This has proved to be a stumbling block for some Coalition schools where, for example, an enthusiastic principal or superintendent is replaced by a new one with no personal investment in the Essential School. Contrariwise, a strong program that was initiated and built from the bottom up can actually gain strength from the advent of a new leader. The only generalization possible is that solidarity at the teacher level&Ntilde; success in empowering those who were not already articulate and powerful seems as critical as committed leadership to the survival of a program in crisis.<p>   Crisis is where many Coalition schools are finding themselves, perhaps necessarily, as they enter the third year of their movement towards change. Sometimes this results from the inevitable and often politically hot question of how far-reaching the Essential School program will be within a school whether it will continue to include only some students and teachers, or expand to comprise them all. (Several Coalition schools face faculty votes on this question right now.) In other cases, the key question is money; many new Coalition programs get their start with private grants, and are expected to move towards tax-supported status after start-up. In a few schools, a faculty divided over questions of elitism, the allocation of time, the question of electives, or other knotty problems contributes to an atmosphere in which the entire project may die a-borning.<p>   Dennis Littky's approach towards failure reflects his expressly stated "bias towards action" in getting a show on the road. "If you're working within a philosophy you've all developed together," he says, "so-called failure is no threat. The data isn't the point; the philosophy is. You've just got to find another way to get it to work." For just that reason, he predicts problems for any school that splits its mission between two or more philosophies. At Thayer, interestingly, joining the Coalition solved one of Littky's own start-up problems, by helping him get grants to pay for training and development. The same thing may be accomplished when a school joins the Re:Learning initiative in its state, as Hope High School has just done in a faculty vote to consider its future direction. "This is a matter of a school deciding as a whole what the whole school will be," says its principal, Paul Gounaris.<p>   Whatever its source, money is a powerful element of a start-up; the Coalition recommends budgeting at least $50,000 in funds for time, travel, and resources for the planning year alone. But Sam Billups warns against judging a program too harshly by its costs in the startup period. "If we staff the Essential School the way we want to, it's going to cost," he says. "But if we can keep more people in school, we can get more state funding as a result." Funding at the local, state, and federal level is cost effective, he argues, simply because his program works to help students succeed in school and in the world. The same might be said of local involvement by business and industry; in some ways, private grants from local sources may indicate just the kind of broad community backing that keeps a program's momentum up.<p><hr><h2>How Fast to Go?</h2><hr>Just what speed that momentum achieves is a matter of some debate among Coalition schools. Hope's Paul Gounaris likens his school's process to a game of Pacman: the Essential School started with a group of students that swallows a larger group, continuing that way until the whole school is contained by the Essential program if the faculty so votes. That is more or less the procedure Walbrook is following, too, although Sam Billups sees a whole-school involvement as a more immediate (and less controversial) prospect than does Gounaris. At Thayer, Littky's approach is both faster and slower than most: an uncompromising centralist about the core values he holds dear, he is willing to tolerate a meandering path to get to them. And at Parkway South, principal Craig Larson warns against trying the school-within-a-school model he started with, because of its danger of divisiveness. Like Littky, he advocates team-building from the start, involving all faculty early on in an ongoing discussion of issues such as personalization, teachers as coach, and exhibitions of mastery. "Talking about ideas like this enables you to raise all the issues without raising red flags on matters like electives or budget," he says. Larson also emphatically advocates getting a broad range of students involved from the start; he began his start-up process with "school improvement teams" made up of students, teachers, and parents.<p>   "The worst mistake you can make," warns one principal who replaced the original Essential School principal in a Coalition school, "is to mandate instant change. We saw this in the open classroom era -- it didn't matter whether teachers wanted it or understood it, they were going to do it. You have to allow time to bring people along." At his school, he instituted a comprehensive staff development program that included all teachers. "We have a lot of people who agree with the principles but not with how our program here was originally imposed from above," he says. Visits to other Coalition schools, he adds, go a long way towards persuading the resistant. "It's very convincing when you see it in practice," he says.<p>   Whatever their start-up styles, all agree that a planning year is crucial and that all such planning, like staff development, must be paid for, not voluntary. But once "E-day" is reached, how fast a program evolves appears to depend in large part on the particular dynamics of the situation -- the push and pull exerted  by a strong or uncertain leader, an enthusiastic or apprehensive faculty, a funding source with deep or shallow pockets. A fledgling program may eventually stand either by the force of people pulling at it from all sides, or by the power of people holding it up consciously in support. How long it lasts, in the end, may turn out to rest on that difference as well.<p><hr>                            <H2>Information and Resources</H2><hr>For more information on the programs referred to in this issue, contact the following people:<p><dir><li> HOPE HIGH SCHOOL<br> AIbin Moser, Head Teacher<br> 324 Hope Street<br> Providence, RI 02906<br> (401) 456-9329<p> <li>PARKWAY SOUTH HIGH SCHOOL<br> Craig Larson, Principal<br> 801 Hanna Road<br> Manchester, MO 63021<br> (314) 394-8300<p> <li>RE:LEARNING: FROM SCHOOLHOUSE TO STATEHOUSE<br> Education Commission for the States<br> 1860 Lincoln Street, Suite 300<br> Denver, CO 80295<br> (303) 830-3631<p> or<p> Coalition of Essential Schools<br> Box 1938<br> Brown University<br> Providence, Rl 02912<br> (401) 863 3384<p> <li>THAYER HIGH SCHOOL<br> Dennis Littky, Principal<br> 43 Parker Street<br> Winchester, NH 03470<br> (603) 239-4381<p> <li>WALBROOK HIGH SCHOOL<br> Marion Finney, Coordinator<br> 200 Edgewood Street<br> Baltimore, MD 21216<br> (301) 396-0726<p></dir><hr>                    <H2>RE:Learning: New Help in Getting Started</H2><hr>Schools or districts that operate in relative isolation have particular difficulty winning the financial, political, and philosophical support they need to think seriously about educational redesign. At the same time, helping schools to find and maintain support is a growing administrative problem for the Coalition staff at Brown, as the Coalition expands and the number of schools requiring such assistance increases.<p>   A 1988 initiative called "Re:Learning: From Schoolhouse to Statehouse," which developed in response to these needs, aims at winning state-level funding for schools interested in Coalition ideas. At the same time, it creates administrative structures through which Coalition staff can maintain better contact with what goes on in the field.<p>   The Re:Learning initiative is a combined effort of the Coalition, the Education Commission of the States (a Denver-based, nonprofit, nationwide interstate compact that helps governors, state legislators, state education officials and others develop policies to improve the quality of education), and interested states. The initiative advocates a bottom-up process of system-wide educational redesign. A state makes this possible by agreeing to legislate funds and other kinds of support so that change can be envisioned and carried out by those most directly involved in the day-to-day realities of students' learning --namely, the teachers themselves. Recognizing the uniqueness of different schools' staffs, students, communities, and histories, the Re:Learning initiative calls on each school to consider how the nine basic Coalition principles apply in its own case, and empowers the school to realize the vision that results.<p><hr><H2>How Re:Learning Works</H2><hr>But how does Re:Learning actually work in the real world? The case of Delaware, one of five states to participate this year (along with Arkansas, Illinois, New Mexico, and Rhode Island), is instructive. In fall 1987, a representative from ECS met with the governor, his education adviser, the president of the state board of education, and the state school superintendent to explain the initiative and discuss Coalition principles. As a result, $210,000 was written into the governor's proposed budget, earmarked for supporting development in up to seven schools. Meanwhile, a network of advocates formed including representatives from the University of Delaware, officials within the Department of Public Instruction, and other state-level education officials. Along with Coalition staff from Brown, this group began to consider various administrative issues, such as the position of state coordinator for the schools to be selected, and the selection process itself. At the same time, meetings were held with representatives of the teachers association, the PTA, and all other groups that would be affected if the initiative were adopted, to discuss the nature of Re:Learning and win further support. As a result of over six months of intensive planning, when the Finance Committee finally passed the proposed $210,000 on the second vote, the state education system was well prepared to welcome and support schools interested in joining the initiative.<p>   Of the four schools eventually chosen -- two high schools, a middle school, and an elementary school -- some responded directly to an invitation that went out to all schools, while others were asked to join for more specific reasons, such as proximity to the university, or in order to achieve better demographic balance. Each school was given $30,000 and asked to match this with $10,000 in new funds, the resulting monies to be used as the school saw fit to support staff discussions and development activities.<p>   After only five months, the effects on the schools are already visible. Consistent with Re:Learning philosophy, each has developed its own approach to rethinking teaching and learning. Steering committees, faculty-wide involvement, reading and study groups, travel to other Essential Schools, and a variety of other development strategies have formed. At one school the state acted as facilitator by arranging an exemption from the state code so that a normal instructional day could be devoted to staff training instead.<p>   Different visions are emerging from the schools, partly because schools are at different stages of the process. "Some schools are farther along than others in reaching consensus about goals," reports state coordinator Joe Fitzpatrick. "But this is a process that cannot and must not be rushed." In his view, when teachers focus on getting students to use their minds well, and realize that they can have power in their own classrooms, "the moment will come when they see the necessity for changing the way a lot of things are done." In the meantime, simply the ongoing staff discussion is generating changes in how teachers teach.<p>   Helen Foss, the governor's education adviser, reports that the principals of all four schools are astonished by the changed atmosphere. In something as prosaic as "the quality of lunchroom talk," she says, discussion of educational objectives and methods is now routine. The "lunchroom index" reflects teachers' widespread perception that what they think and say matters. "Just in this first year of studying and thinking, it's extremely impressive to hear the teachers talk," Foss says. "When they start saying things to you like, 'For the first time, I really feel like a professional,' well . . ."<p>   In its first year, the Re:Learning initiative seems to be working well. The state of Delaware has allotted an additional $165,000 to bring new schools in, and on a national level several new states have expressed interest. The initiative may prove to be a powerful and satisfying way to get started.<p> <hr>                             <H2>  Write to Us...</H2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or coming editions.

How many conferences they have to go to before they can stoplistening to inspiring abstractions and start talking about the practicalproblems in <i>their</i> school that just won't seem to go away. How many times someonein their system is going to say to them, "That won't work here." How change suchas the Coalition of Essential School proposes is ever going to work if somebodydoesn't start figuring out what to do about that one simple objection, whichturns into millions more before their eyes.<p>   There must be times when what they want is a strategy huddle --to gettogether, for a day or two, with people who understand the problem and are goingthrough it themselves, people not necessarily entrenched in the same schoolsystem, and so able to see it with fresh eyes. People who can suggest things.People who can alert them to what might go wrong if they try new strategies, andencourage them to try them anyway.<p>   That's what the planners of the Coalition's 1990 annual Fall Forum had inmind when they invited participants to choose another path through thatconference, especially if they needed no introduction to Essential Schoolphilosophy. "Strand A" of the Forum's two-day program, they decided, would offerthe usual workshops in CES's basic ideas; but "Strand B" would take schoolpeople one step further, linking them into strategy sessions designed, inorganizer Pat Wasley's words, to "break through the barriers to change."<p>   The 200 people who signed up for that approach --Essential school teachers oradministrators, district and state people, foundation people, professors --choseto forgo a "survey course" approach to the Forum in favor of "less is more."They identified one problem that had come to seem intractable in their school:heterogeneous grouping, for instance, or scheduling cross-disciplinary courses,or faculty members who resisted new ideas. Then, in three half-day sessions,they joined with other school people who faced the same issue, and struggled tocome up with strategies that might work.<p>   The format was strictly devised --so strictly, in fact, that some groupsrebelled almost immediately and threw it out the window. First, they were todefine the problem, including all its characteristics and giving a number ofexamples. Next, they were to pair off and describe a specific variation on theproblem that confronted each participant. One partner in each pair would come upwith strategies to address the other's problem; and then the group togetherwould "troubleshoot" those strategies, projecting how they might affect peoplethroughout the school's organizational structure. All this would be recorded onforms provided for the purpose --the materials, in fact, that are distilled andsummarized in the pages that follow here.<p>   On the first morning, as groups gathered with a mixture of trepidation andhope to define their problems, the unwieldy monster of school reform unleasheditself. No single problem exists, it appears; or each is hydra-headed,containing in itself all the other problems as well. How can you talk aboutscheduling cross-disciplinary courses without confronting the resistant facultywho will not consider teaching outside their specialization? How can you talkabout common planning without coming up against scheduling? Can you rethink thecurriculum, or place students in heterogeneous groupings, without asking how toassess what is good work? Around tables in the cavernous exhibition hall at St.Louis's Clarion Hotel, groups expanded and contracted with excited, sometimesexplosive energy as they tried to contain their problems in words.<p>   "The point," said Paula Evans, a Strand B organizer who is director of theCoalition's Citibank Faculty Program, "is to allow the group to think much morecreatively about the strategies they come up with. Forcing open the definitionas far as you can gives you different perspectives on the specific problem, anda bigger arena from which to draw solutions." If the problem is construed toonarrowly, she noted, it may be difficult to see its complexity, and to findentry points that can lead to solutions.<p>   "People want to define the problem quickly so they can get on with posingsolutions right away," agreed Fran Flynt, who has taught in the Essential schoolprogram at Springdale High School in Arkansas, and who led a lively Strand Bgroup. "Taking time to look at all aspects of the problem makes it bigger,messier, more interconnected --which may be the whole point."<p>   Accepting the messiness was the first step, and perhaps the last as well, asweary participants disbanded at the end of their second day. What came between --highly specific, one-to-one conversations that outlined problem situations andcollaborated on strategic solutions --was so unusual to those present that theykept remarking in amazement on finding it at an educational conference. "This isan exercise in 'student as worker," one teacher said. "But we're the students.We're charged with finding out answers together, among ourselves, and testingthem against reality. What an experience to take back to the classroom."<p>   Not everyone was happy with the process. Some participants complained thatthey had too many problems to stick with the same subject for a day and a half;others left without clear "Coalition answers" to what troubled them. But StrandB organizers smiled and nodded when such objections were raised: Just so, theysaid. Only through sustained conversation among people with such different roles--an assistant principal from a Brooklyn school for pregnant teens, a home ecteacher from Illinois, a PTA council chairwoman, a foundation director, a middleschool principal from rural New Mexico, a member of the governor's staff inIndiana --does a model emerge, they said. It is a model not for "the answers,"or even "the strategies," but for <i>how to get to them.</i> "The question is how totranslate problems into strategies," said CES consultant Faith Dunne. "You haveto get past identifying the problem and then throwing your hands up in despair."Even the hard task of sticking with one problem through three long workshopsessions was a big step towards learning to achieve change, said many of thosewho did it as they left St. Louis for home.<p>   Undeniably, though, a majority of those who came to the Coalition's FallForum are already persuaded of the value of Essential schooling. In more than afew cases, the dilemmas they presented were met with "strategies" that boileddown to optimistic platitudes on the order of, "Just explain the advantages andthose guys will see the light." The real test of Strand B's collaborativeapproach must come when its participants take the process home to the real worldof their own school systems. Will it work there as well as it did at the Forum,where people with such different roles were able constructively to enrich eachother's experience and come up with new ideas? Or will the nature of changewithin a system, made up as it is of a million small personal interactions withall their individual nuances and politics and power, prove daunting on thatlevel? If answers emerge at all, they will come school by school, person byperson, problem by once "intractable" problem. <p><hr><h2>Quotes: Problems</h2><hr><i>How can mathematics (other than statistics and probability) be incorporated intointerdisciplinary work?

I have read a few of the essays Pat Wasley haswritten on the struggles teachers go through as they and their schools change;like those essays, your reports also reflect approval and doubt, success andfailure, enthusiasm and resistance. How refreshing this is; how enormouslyhelpful, too, I have to think, in reaching teachers and administrators (andthose who are considering grants to Re:Learning efforts) who are looking intothe nature of Re:Learning schools. By not overselling the product you make apowerful case that something good if imperfect (and shouldn't it be? will anyteacher believe it if nine principles suddenly transform schools into the Gardenof Eden?) is happening in these Essential schools. The lack of defensiveness,the willingness to play the objective reporter --as much as possible --withoutjudging or "correcting the criticisms --is a pleasure.<p>   The attention on how schools can be personal, how a faculty can set up newways of knowing all students on an individual basis, speaks so well to the humandilemma of teaching in a large public school. I have taught in two boardingschools and in a fairly large public school. Your issue on advisory groupsoffers some terrific examples of how those large public schools can take what isoften most critical in making private schools different and better places formany students to learn. Some people may wonder why the Coalition would focus onit --aren't there more IMPORTANT educational issues that matter? But of course,as the Coalition understands, this kind of personalization is at the heart ofbetter schools. Bravo.<p>Peter G.

Is <i>what</i> to teach the issue, or HOW to teachit? How do differing ability levels, areas of expertise, and teacher stylesaffect the rethinking process? Once you're under way, how is a new curriculumbest conveyed to others?<p>   Some of the challenges that immediately arose were these:<p><ul>  <li>Modifying the curriculum to reflect connections between disciplines. <li>Keeping what works in the current curriculum as it is improved; not losing     foundation skills, but adding what's missing.<li> Studying how kids learn in light of current views of intelligence, and     shifting from acquiring knowledge itself to learning how to USE knowledge.   <li>Engaging people in and out of school with the rethinking of the curriculum,     and using their expectations and support as one clearly defines the skills,     standards, and activities desired for various levels. <li>Coming up with content that will connect those skills, standards, and     activities with the specific school's situation, not dictated by national     tests, textbooks, or state requirements. A good curriculum reflects the     strengths of its teachers, the cultural and social makeup of its community,     the rhythms of the year or the day, what individual students find     meaningful and interesting.   <li>Figuring out how to assess what students have learned based on the skills,     standards, and activities they've been taught --shifting from an     answer-oriented curriculum to a question-centered approach.   <li>Committing the time and resources to rethink the curriculum in a way that     involves teachers and deals with their fears of change.</ul><p>   As the group wrestled with their definition, a striking number of otherangles into the problem arose --so much so that the group resorted to drawingpictures of what happens when one sets out to rethink the curriculum. At thecenter of one of these concentric graphs was the phrase "meaningful learning,"surrounded by a field defining <i>what</i> the phrase means, which was in turnencompassed by a circle describing <i>how</i> it might happen. (The correctly formattedversion of this graph appears in the published version of this issue.)<p><b>MEANINGFUL LEARNING:</b><p><b>What</b><p><ul><li>Uses the mind well in different circumstances<li>Promotes lifelong skills<li>Teaches the child to make connections<li> Fits the student into a tradition of learning and analysis<li>Helps the student understand the world and its content</ul><p><b>How</b><p><ul><li>Use teacher strengths<li>Assess it; know whether or how you succeeded<li>Address different abilities<li> Set goals; know what you're after<li>Trust yourself; don't wait for "answers"<li>Get your message out so fears are overcome <li>Make the curriculum flow; avoid repetition<li>Give enough time and money to it</ul><p>   What kinds of problems arise when all this starts happening? Fear of changeis a big one for teachers, the group agreed. Among other things, they worryabout giving up a straight textbook approach, learning how to lead a gooddiscussion, and knowing whether the students are actually learning from the newways. Certain practical steps will help:<p><ul><li>Decide what a student needs by the end of school<li>Decide what a student needs by each level, and how those levels can connect     for continuity<li> Write interdisciplinary curriculum units around an "essential question"<li> Write units that will lead to authentic performances<li> Design ways to tell if the curriculum is actually working, and whether more     desirable "qualities of mind" are resulting<li>Allow enough time to work on the curriculum<li>Accommodate the autonomy and individual styles of teachers</ul><p>   A good curriculum is not inflexible, one study group in this area concluded;it should be able accommodate specific situations with a degree of spontaneity.In one community with a large proportion of Zuni Indians, for instance, studentswould speak Zuni at home and in the hallways but be taught and tested inEnglish. Their scores on standard measures label them slower academically thanstudents in other schools and districts, but a rethinking of the curriculumcould challenge this assumption --measuring their language skills in Zuni, forinstance, or using their own culture's ways of teaching via apprenticeshiprather than memorization, they might be assessed entirely differently. To reachthese students and help them succeed in an Anglo system may take a neworientation on the part of their school district. Exhibitions might replaceconventional tests, and competency tests might be orally administered withdirections given in Zuni.<p>   Another group examined in detail what would happen if a school set aboutdeveloping interdisciplinary courses around an essential question. One strategywas to find the question's connections with the various disciplines, then insiston authentic --not contrived --ways to explore the question both within eachdiscipline and among several. How would this affect various constituencieswithin the school system?<p>   For students, the group predicted, linking the disciplines in this way shouldresult in more coherence, and probably in more satisfaction and thought, as theystay with a subject longer and see it from different perspectives. They wouldplace more value on content as they see it help to create a meaningful contextfor the question they are following. But the approach could also create stressfor students used to a more formal and predictable --and anonymous --structure.Like teachers, they may be afraid they're not learning the "right" thing.<p>   Parents too are used to defining a "right" curriculum, based on what theythemselves had to doin school, and often expressed as "the basics." Basing a curriculum on questionsmay mean a kind of questioning of intellectual authority by their kids, whichcan threaten parents. On the other hand, cross-disciplinary projects often callon parental contributions, linking them to their children's learning in specificand helpful ways; and they may see their kids happier and more engaged atschool.<p>   Partly because of that very engagement, teachers may have more fun in the newcurriculum as they try new things with the collaboration and support of otherstaff. But their new responsibility to work together can consume time andprovoke anxiety as well; continually having to create the new curriculum meansthat teachers are often just one step ahead of the game in class preparations.<p>   Building administrators inevitably take much of the flak if such strainsarise; but they also benefit from a more lively tone to the school and a moreengaged teaching staff. The same is true of the central office, which mustunderstand what's going on so as to negotiate any necessary waivers from stateauthorities. The school board, too, must understand the system to explain it tovoters; they have a predictable fear that the new ways will hurt students morethan help them.<p>   The business community, which has long been asking for students who canactively solve problems, must be persuaded that an interdisciplinary curriculumaddresses that need. But if grants from businesses are partially supportingschool reform, there could be pressure to do things their way; what if a majordonor wants proof of results through standardized testing?<p>   Similar pressures can show up at the state level, where the very regulationsonce written by the board of education are being questioned by the newcurriculum. The equity of the new system may be challenged, too, by those whoequate a uniform curriculum with justice. Still, certain states like to bethought of as "progressive" in education, and the corporate grant money that canaccompany change. For legislators, too, educational reform is good politics --but they need more money than they have, they want results fast, and they askfor foolproof measures of improvement.<p>   What is the overall effect of the new curriculum on the organizationalstructure? "It messes it up," this group succinctly noted; and it requires moremoney as well. "We will have to play in two worlds for a while," they observed --adopting a new approach, at the same time winning at the old game bydemonstrating success through conventional measures. "We may not approve oftests, but we will have to use them or live with them," they concluded, "whilewe're in that transitional never-never land." <p><hr><h2>                           Assessment and Exhibitions<br>     Do we rearrange the furniture we've got, or get new furniture instead?</h2><hr>One group began by naming a broad problem related to the topic of exhibitions:How do you figure out what you want kids to know and be able to do? And how doyou tailor your school to suit such outcomes? The key dimensions of thatproblem, participants decided, were these:<p><ul><li><b>THE AUTHORITY PROBLEM. </b>What role does each of the following parties play informulating a school's goals (the first part of the problem), and in ensuringthe vigorous and structurally embedded pursuit of them (the second part)?Principal? Departments? Community, including the business community? Parents?State-level authority? District-level authority? University, including localinstitutions and the larger research-and-development community? Teachers?Students?<p><li><b>THE IMPACT PROBLEM. </b>Here the group took a look especially at the second partof their problem --what happens once goals have been established? What must bechanged to better aim the school toward the achievement of these goals? Theycame up with a host of candidates: scheduling, course design, the budget,teachers' habits, teachers' skills, teachers' sense of the range of their owncompetence, teachers' autonomy (especially in the area of standard setting andassessment), transcripts, school-level transitions, the community's sense ofwhat the school is and of how it functions, graduation rate and timing, internalstructures like departments.<p><li><b>THE KNOWLEDGE PROBLEM. </b>How much should the establishment and pursuit ofoutcome-based goals in an Essential school be affected by the traditionaldivision of knowledge into subject fields? How much should goals and structuresdeliberately ignore traditional subject boundaries? A related but somewhatdifferent question: how discipline-bound should the outcome goals and structuresof an Essential school be, and how interdisciplinary? How much account shouldthe high school take of the ways in which knowledge is traditionally organizedin higher education? Looking in another direction, how much should the highschool consult with middle and elementary schools in the formulation of goalsand standards and methods? Granted that schools ought to focus first andprincipally on intellectual goals, how much do intellectual goals depend uponsocial ones? Another way to ask this question: how much is cognitive changedependent upon social interaction? And what are the implications for instructionin this dependence? How much of what we want for kids is already known, and howmuch must still be discovered? Another way to  ask this question: how muchshould our goal-setting be a matter of rearranging the furniture we've now got,and how much a matter of getting new furniture?<p><li><b>THE STANDARDS PROBLEM.</b> How should a school set standards? How can it tune itsstandards to workplace and other community expectations? How much shouldstandards vary over time and circumstance? How leveled should standards be interms of developmental appropriateness and the nature of the challengesattempted? How can a school make sure its standards are pegged to the optimumrather than the minimum? How can a school tie graduation to the achievement ofstandards? Ho w can a school ensure that its standards are applied equitablyacross classrooms, subjects, experiences? How much should assessment operatecoldly on the basis of standards alone, and how much should it take account ofcontextual things (how hard the kid worked, how much progress she made, how muchthe experience mattered to her, how much an encouraging word now will push herforward, etc.)? How can schools ensure honest and thorough assessment ofindividuals when the assessment process may involve public and cooperativeactivity?<p><li><b>THE EQUITY PROBLEM. </b>How can we ensure that the processes we imagine --settingoutcome goals, assessing kids in these terms, orienting the structures andculture of the school to this end --will be equitable? How do we know that theywill treat kids equitably across the following dimensions: learning style (ordominant intelligence), gender, ability/disability, native language, economicand other family circumstances, developmental issues, learning preparedness?<p><li><b>THE METHODS OR TECHNOLOGY PROBLEM.</b>Exhibitions can be more process-oriented,as in portfolio schemes, or more project-oriented, as in schemes that emphasizecumulative or integrative senior experiences and recitals --more like WaldenIII's "rite of passage experience" (ROPE), or like their nineteenth-centurynamesakes. What's the right mix of these two (soft) technologies? Meanwhile,what's the proper role of (hard) information technology in the maintenance andachievement of standards, and in the management of information related toassessment? How much do kids' and teachers' information needs shift when theschool begins to center its work on the achievement of specified outcomes? Howcan a school ensure equitable access to learning opportunities when theseopportunities are dependent upon technology?<p><li><b>THE LEDGER PROBLEM. </b>Schools are currently evaluated, and evaluate themselves,by means of what we called ledger entries: drop-out figures, standardized testscores, average daily attendance, number of students taking advanced placementcourses, college acceptance rate, etc. This habit we have of ledger-like schoolevaluation can deeply affect how a school assesses its kids, and also how itstructures itself. Solving the larger problem we've set ourselves requires ashift from the ledger method of school evaluation to a more dynamic method. Whatshould be the new governing metaphor of school evaluation? Is graph better thanledger? Is portrait better than graph ? Is portfolio better than portrait? Whatare the practical consequences of each?<p></ul>   The group then set about identifying strategies for addressing theseproblems, and came up with these:<p><ul><li><b>BE A VOID SEEKER. </b>Seize every opportunity to fill a void --with ideas,provocations, and experiments in orienting the school to good outcomes, and thepursuit of them.<p><li><b>BUILD CONSTITUENCIES FOR PLANNING BACKWARDS </b>--either directly or with flankingmaneuvers. So, maybe the faculty is lukewarm now, but what do parents think?Maybe the superintendent has doubts, but what about the business community?<p><li><b>COLLECT LOTS OF IMAGES AND EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOU'RE AFTER </b>--images ofexcellence, lists of outcomes, examples of standard-setting mechanisms, etc.Show them around to anyone who's interested; promote them.<p><li><b>FOCUS ON THE KIDS </b>whenever you're faced with philosophical, political, or anyother kind of objection. Say, "But what do we want for the kids?"<p><li><b> REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE MANY ROADS TO SUCCESS</b> --many possible models, manypossible reconfigurations of projects already in place (choice options, magnetprograms, etc.). Take stock, then move forward using whatever you find.<p><li><b> SEEK ASSESSMENT PARTNERS</b> both inside and outside ordinary authoritystructures. Remember that there are many legitimate stakeholders in this work,and most of them want to help: district supervisors, state department people,local scholars, parents, the business community, etc.<p><li><b>FACED WITH AN EQUITY ISSUE, FORCE IT OPEN</b> --ask people to examine all kids'best interests. Ask what equity means, what it entails, when it is most inevidence. Ask what the difference may be between an equity based on uniformdeprivation, and one based on uniform excellence.<p><li><b>ASK PEOPLE CONTINUALLY TO FOCUS ON THE FUTURE: </b>what the school will be like intwo years, what the sixth graders will know when they graduate, what theworkplace will demand in the year 2010, where mathematics education is heading,what kids will remember about American history a year after they've taken thecourse.<p><li><b> STRIVE TO STRIKE BALANCES.</b> Avoid dichotomous choices --between homogeneous andheterogeneous grouping, authentic and ordinary assessment, a college-boundcurriculum and a non-college-bound curriculum. All these apparently dichotomousoptions have their legitimate time and place, and their way of mixing well witheach other.<p><li><b>APPROACH THE PROBLEM AS A MATTER REQUIRING NEGOTIATION, </b>which is to say amatter requiring the identification of apparently competing interests. The pointis "to get to yes" --to get resolution by means of satisfying key interests (asopposed to giving people what they say they want).<p><li><b>COMBINE EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT.</b> Assess the activity before you assess theperformance. Find ways to make the school a center of inquiry, spending as muchenergy assessing itself as it does assessing its kids.<p><li><b>EXPLORE AND INVENT METHODS THAT COMBINE GROUP ASSESSMENT WITH INDIVIDUALASSESSMENT</b> --that provide individual accountability without sacrificingauthentic experience in collaborative work and study.<p><li><b> REMEMBER THAT THE PROBLEM ITSELF IS A SYSTEMIC ONE </b>--one that touches manyfacets of school life. So, it must be approached systemically. One good tool forunderstanding systemic change is an analytical framework devised by Lee Bolmanand Terry Deal. It assumes that all elements of school life take on a somewhatdifferent meaning when viewed within each of four perceptual frames: thestructural frame, the political frame, the human relations frame, and thesymbolic frame. So, for example, an exhibition within the structural framerepresents a change from the ordinary accumulation of Carnegie units; within thepolitical frame, it is a threat to parents' and kids' sense of how long highschool is; within the human relations frame, it is a challenge to the school'shabits of advising students; and within the symbolic frame, it is a ceremony andan endorsement of certain ways of knowing and presenting.<p></ul>   In another small group, participants wrestled with a particular aspect of theexhibitions problem: How does one arrive at a school-wide consensus on learneroutcomes across the disciplines for promotion or graduation? They came up withfour strategies:<p><ul><li>Have faculty in every department develop lists of essential skills, content,and attitudes about learning. Keep the lists short, focusing on essentials.Invite students input through class discussions or workshops. Then get thedepartments together to review and share their lists, working it into one masterlist.<p><li>Bring in local professionals or university-level faculty from different fieldsto talk about what they're looking for in high school graduates.<p><li> Draw on material from national associations of teachers, like the NationalCouncil of Teachers of Mathematics guidelines. Look at the guidelines developedby other Essential Schools where exhibitions are central: The ROPE course atWalden III, Central Park East's Senior Institute, Rochester's School WithoutWalls. (See Horace, Vol. 6, No. 3.)<p></ul><p>   Next, the group turned to the consequences of their strategies. How wouldthey tend to affect various constituencies--teachers, students, parents? Whatshort-term or long-term effects might they have on people, organizationalstructure, the budget?<p>   Starting with the departments, they noted, would be inherently divisive; theprocess of making choices that leads from "Less is more" can be verythreatening. Why not instead lessen the territoriality by meeting acrossdepartments from the start? Work in small groups to define five individual goalsfirst, they suggested, then hammer them into five group goals, then into fivefaculty goals.<p>   Over the long term, this group suggested, a school might aim to structureitself in houses or teams instead of by departments. This would have its effecton the organizational structure; it might lead to basing hiring decisions moreon whether a teacher could be a generalist, and to rethinking the school'sscheduling framework. It would also require money in the budget for staffdevelopment, as teachers are asked to think across disciplinary lines.<p>(Thanks to Joe McDonald of the Coalition staff for the comprehensivedistillation of his group's work that makes up for the major section of theabove discussion.) <p><hr>                     <h2>        Heterogeneous Grouping<br>                It's not what you do, it's the way that you do it</h2><p><hr>Should students be grouped in classes by ability levels for academic reasons? Orshould students of differing levels learn together in heterogeneous groups? Howbest to resolve this tension was the problem this group worried over.<p>   To realize fully the implications of the problem, they noted, it wasnecessary to address its class origins. Because students of lower socio-economicbackgrounds have long been offered educational programs designed to reflecttheir presumed lower abilities and ambitions, they have been restricted from themainstream --to their own loss and that of society. Heterogeneous grouping ismeant to do away with this stultifying social stratification; but it createssignificant new problems.<p>   Especially in its early stages, the group decided, heterogeneous groupingcannot merely mean pooling the student population in different ways. Once allstudents have access to a richer educational experience, schools must take othersteps so that real learning results.<p>   To begin, the group suggested, class size must be reduced so that thespectrum of all students' needs may be addressed. Teachers must have the time toget to know their students better, and to pay attention to the needs of morecapable as well as slower students. Second, heterogeneous classes need to buildin support structures for classroom work, such as:<p><ul><li> Permanent drop-in "labs" or tutorial centers where students can seek  additional help outside of class from teachers or advanced students.  (Corporate grants can be sought to start up such programs.)<li>Special ed teachers assigned to certain classes on a regular basis to help  students as appropriate.<li>Aides, or teaching machines like computers, in larger classrooms.</ul><p>   Of key importance is developing evaluation techniques based on studentperformance on specific academic criteria. Students must show they can masterfundamental concepts in a particular discipline, the group asserted, but theywill obviously not all master them at the same level. For this reason, anexamination of "general knowledge," while relevant, should not be the onlycriterion for assessment; in a heterogeneous class, students' demonstrations oftheir conceptual mastery is also desirable. Some in the group argued forassessment based also on teachers' observations of emerging leadership skills,increased attention in class, and such less easily quantified matters.<p>   Teachers will need more time to develop and try out new strategies andmethods for heterogeneous classes. But most important, the group noted, theconcept of student as worker and teacher as coach must be employed in theheterogeneous classroom. If students and teachers interact using this approach,many of the pressing problems of differing ability levels can turn into actualassets, through peer tutoring and increased responsibility for individualresearch.<p>   Still, many teachers spoke of their frustration with "forced" heterogeneousgrouping, and especially of the burdens that it places on more capable students."How am I supposed to meet the needs of students," asked one teacherdespairingly, "when they are so diverse in academic ability, social and physicalmaturity, emotional stability, ethnic background, and socioeconomic status?"Ninety percent of his energy is focused on ten percent of the kids, said oneinner-city teacher. And the more skilled kids themselves complain, others noted,when they perceive that they are being used as classroom caretakers.<p>   A teacher from a fairly academic high school with a high percentage ofstudents going on to higher education agreed that students, parents, andteachers were opposed to changing the system in a school they deemed successfulalready. The teachers, he said, taught to the state Regents exams, and thestudents were tracked accordingly.<p>   A physics teacher in an Essential school presented his version of thedilemma: The wide range of abilities and interests in his class, he said,imposed a frustrating level of mediocrity that he did not know how to deal with.Gifted students became bored, students with special needs or learningdisabilities ended up failing, and he was unsure that the grades he gavereflected what a student "really knows."<p>   What strategies might work for this class? The group suggested:<p><ul><li>Eliminating textbooks and substituting a series of assignments that kids could  complete at their own pace.<li>Tracking the grading system within the class so that students choose  different levels of challenge they will attempt to master, and receive a  grade that indicates the level they chose.<li> Giving slower students an "incomplete" rather than a failing grade, and  allowing them to work toward mastery for another term.<li>Dividing whole-year courses into half-year segments, to better keep track of  who's having trouble before it's too late.</ul><p>   Reflecting student mastery as suggested here would require a different kindof transcript, the group noted. Teachers must be willing to shift their approachmore toward coaching, and to break the curriculum down into sequentialincrements. Assessment methods, homework, and classroom work must be revised toinclude "challenge" sections for students who work at higher levels. Ideally,gifted students could work more independently, leaving the teacher time to coachthose who need more time and help.<p>   Clearly helping out this teacher would involve changes in attitude and habitsall the way up the hierarchical ladder. It may be an important decision whetherto deal with his problem as a bureaucratic one--requiring transcript changes,course definition shifts, and the like--or whether to focus on his immediatehuman frustration and how he might start to relieve it by changes in hisclassroom that he has the immediate power to make on his own. As it begins towork, perhaps, step by step the bureaucratic obstacles can be addressed. <p><hr>                                   <h2>Leadership<br>                 More than standing there and letting it happen</h2><hr>Who are the leaders in an Essential school, and what do we want from them? Canthe conventional organizational system support this kind of leadership, or willit have to change? What's the difference between a leader and a manager? How dowe go about identifying leaders for hiring and promotion, developing them fromexisting staff; and encouraging reluctant leaders to step forward or expandtheir horizons?<p>   No matter how much they want to be empowered, the group declared, individualswill always tend to come back to a central person for support, direction, andsomeone to blame when things go wrong. A dilemma may arise if a school is movingfrom a wheel-like structure, with the spokes attached to a central leader, to astructure that allows for multiple leaders. For example, a teacher who isdesignated an Essential school "coordinator" may not have the defined role of aconventional administrator to fall back on. Finally, a good leader must manageher boundaries, welcoming input not only from the school's central structuresbut also from elsewhere in the system.<p>   A leader must always ask herself, "Am I just standing there letting ithappen, or am I really leading?" This last, the group suggested, depends on theleader getting all of her "publics" to move in a general direction. Those"publics" may be the principal and faculty, for example, or the school board,the legislature, or the parent organization; but whoever they are, the effectiveleader must answer the same questions:<p><ul><li>What kind of behavior do we want from this "public"?<li>What promotes or inhibits the support and help of this group?<li>What would help remove or reduce whatever inhibits this group's support?</ul><p>   As an example, the group looked at the principal and faculty, from whom theywanted behavior like this:<p><ul><li>full and open participation<li>willingness to assume different and unique responsibilities<li>an understanding of Essential school concepts<li>willingness to work in groups and teams<li>willingness to take risks and learn through mistakes<li>enthusiasm, professionalism, commitment to quality work<li>ability to relay Essential school concepts to students<li>willingness to express unpopular views<li>a sense of humor and collegiality</ul><p>   Specifically, they noted, the principal is a key person in whom such behavioris desirable. An "authentic principal," the group noted, is accountable and non-manipulative, focusing first on a person rather than on that person's role. Ifthese qualities are present, trust results --among colleagues, between facultyand principal, and within the organization as a whole. If they are not present,one can expect active and passive resistance, and eventually withdrawal from thegroup's commitment to change.<p>   Members of this group raised a number of specific problems and strategiessurrounding questions of leadership, including:<p><ul><li>What happens when an Essential school is not committed to shareddecisionmaking? Establish a council with an uncomplicated process, the groupsuggested, to make, fund, and carry out decisions arrived at by consensus. Ifteachers do not want this kind of responsibility, make sure what they do or saymakes a difference, working with opinion leaders (begin with the principal) tosolve problems.<p><li>What if your leaders burn out, or lose their enthusiasm? Try breaking the taskinto manageable pieces, some in the group suggested. Give authentic and specificencouragement, preferably in writing and delivered in person. Define and modelyour expectations; offer management consulting on leadership styles, andclerical assistance. Share common experiences, and put pressure on the principalto offer stronger administrative commitments. If all else fails, "send them toOrlando in February," someone joked.<p><li>How do you get an organization to support Essential school leaders? Directlybring up the issues in specific and concrete terms, the group strategized; thendon't avoid conflicts, but resolve them. Share the knowledge and thedecisionmaking with all the school's constituencies (community, school board,etc.), letting others lead as the situation warrants, and arranging workshopsthat they all can attend. Develop a strong communications plan for both internaland outside use. </ul><p><hr>             <h2>       Resistant Teachers As a Force for Change<br>                      "We have met the enemy and he is us"</h2><hr>The problem of resistance to Essential school ideas, this group decided, takesplace on two levels: institutional and personal. On both levels, it arises outof the same sources:<p><ul><li><b>FEAR. </b>What does "less is more" mean? What does being a generalist entail, andhow will it interfere with the way I currently do my job?<p><li><b>DISTRUST. </b>Resistant staff may be self-reliant, successful, recognized as goodteachers; and their resistance may provide useful feedback. They may distrustauthority (even if it is site-based and teacher-run, and distrust other peoplepressuring them towards new styles of learning, heterogeneous grouping, oralterations in their schedule.<p><li><b>TURF PROTECTION. </b>On an institutional level, this may mean programs incompetition with each other --a school within a school that gets preferentialtreatment, for example. Issues of power arise: who hires, who's on what team,who's telling whom to change?<p><li><b>TIME ISSUES. </b>At an institutional level, time may be a big objection --willthere be time to guarantee the coverage of subjects that teachers feel theyneed, to prepare kids for standardized tests? On a personal level, time is afactor too --time for classroom planning or for all-faculty meetings is scarce;and on a larger level, it takes time to make change happen --everyone seems towant change all at once! Time issues can create resentment if only some teachersare getting extra planning time for Essential classes or teams.<p></ul>   What strategies could work to break through these problems? The groupsuggested several:<p><ul><li>Make people who feel left out feel unique instead. A home economics teacher,for instance, may be using exhibitions as an assessment measure already; ask herto share her evaluative techniques with the rest of the staff, or lead adiscussion on how such methods might work in other disciplines.<p><li>Break out of the usual patterns of socialization among teachers within theschool, such as by sitting at lunch with resisting teachers, or arranginginterdepartmental events.<p><li>Invite vocal resisters to attend workshops at the school's expense. Solicittheir criticism and take it seriously. The resistant faculty member can help cutthrough jargon and analyze problems if his criticisms are treatedconstructively. "We have met the enemy and he is us," quipped one group leader.<p></ul>   To explore this further, small groups took on specific problems at first thepersonal and then the institutional level. One group, for example, worried overhow to address the problem of a teacher who resisted teaming. The strategiesthey suggested started with a personal conference with him, asking him about hisconcerns. A "shadow study" could be initiated, with the resistant teacherfollowing a student through a typical day. Perhaps he could be invited as avisiting expert to address a class in another discipline on some subject theyhold in common. Or he could be offered release time to plan for teaming, or toattend a conference at which he could gain new ideas.<p>   So what effects would these strategies have on the resistant teacher and therest of the school community? The group recognized that this problem has nosurefire solution; "shadowing," for example, could work well or it couldbackfire. Students could get to see the teacher in a different environment, toview him as a learner like themselves and to gain from his new viewpoint ontheir subject matter. Other teachers could be inspired to try a shadow studythemselves or they could be threatened by having their classes visited byanother teacher. In any case, the atmosphere of the school begins to change whenteachers start visiting each others' classes and sharing their expertise. On apersonal level, everyone might start to know the resistant teacher better, andhe may gain in self confidence and awareness of the possibilities of teaming.The shadow study could also demonstrate to the teacher a need for cross-disciplinary teaming.<p>   The group considered the view that "resistance" is best thought of as a stepor stage in the process of change --during which everyone can look at his or herown personal concerns about that change. The issue then becomes how to helpeveryone acknowledge their various concerns, and move on to thinking about howto carry out the program.<p>   Another group worked on how to provide the time staff would need to worktoward Essential School change during their regular working hours. Theirstrategies, they decided, could include:<p><ul><li>Scheduling four day-long planning sessions, without students at school, per  year --preferably at the end of regular breaks such as Thanksgiving and winter  vacations.<li>Seeking support from community businesses such as ice rinks or movie theatres,  who might schedule special programs for these days.<li>Including team-building activities for staff as part of planning days.</ul><p>   At an organizational level, the group suggested, this move would shift thebalance of power within the structure toward teachers. With sustained blocks oftime to plan, they reasoned, teachers would not feel as though more work werebeing piled into their crowded days.<p>   What financial implications does this kind of change have for the overallschool organization? Some money might be saved on busing, but the cafeteriacould lose money; and any consultants brought in for the planning sessions wouldcost extra. Whether personal days or conference days would be used up by theseplanning days was another area to be decided, they agreed.<p>   At the state level, legislators would get the message that teachers needprofessional time for planning; many states, they noted, already support suchpolicies. The move could increase the school's prestige and visibility with thestate education department, making it more likely to get help in the future. Andin the long term, teacher morale and student engagement should rise as new ideasmake their way into the classroom. <p><hr>                             <h2> Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or comingeditions.

Principal Marilyn Hohmann is sitting next tothe district superintendent, Donald W. Ingwerson. She is a scrappy, compact,red-headed dynamo with fire in her blue eyes; he is serene, white-haired, akindly, almost ministerial countenance belying the bulldog tenacity that liesbeneath. He turns to her mildly. "If in ten years I can come into this highschool and not recognize most of its administrative or teaching practices," hesays, "I will consider our work to be a success."<p>   Fifteen years ago this Louisville school district was in a crisis of theworst order. The decline of factory work had left the region with tremendousunemployment. Louisville's schools, with mostly black students, were runseparately from those of surrounding Jefferson County, whose students weremostly white, and the systems were under court order to merge and desegregate.Overloaded with administrators, the bureaucracy of the merged system sagged tothe breaking point. Anger and alienation ran high in the community.<p>   Today, the same district has created conditions and incentives many point toas a nationwide model for school reform. In his ten years as superintendent, DonIngwerson's ultimate goal has been children's classroom success, but he seesclassrooms as only one link in a chain of success that involves the entirecommunity. To turn Jefferson County into what he calls "a learning community,"Ingwerson's administration made structural changes that laid the groundwork forchange across the district. When in 1990 Kentucky legislators radically rewrotethe laws governing its entire educational system, Jefferson County was wherethey turned for advice. And yet even now, forward-looking educators in thisdistrict consider that the most important reforms--those that take place betweenstudent and teacher in the classroom--still wait to be made.<p>   The vocabulary of reform in Jefferson County is familiar--it speaks ofrestructuring schools; of participatory, site-based management; of professionaldevelopment for teachers, business-school partnerships, and parental choice. Butit is particularly striking how thoroughly this school district has made its ownthe articulated goals of the Coalition of Essential Schools. Don Ingwersonpassionately shares Theodore Sizer's conviction that all children can learn; onehears that phrase everywhere, from central office budget discussions and schoolboard meetings to athletic banquets and job apprenticeships. The metaphor of"student as worker" forms the theme of a district-wide staff development effort.Performance-based assessments that ask students to demonstrate competence areincreasingly required in all schools. Little wonder that of Jefferson County's20 high schools, six have been members of the Coalition of Essential Schoolssince 1986, and five more have recently joined. And although each of theseschools differs considerably in just how and how far it reflects EssentialSchool principles, together they form a valuable picture of the practical andpolitical process of "going Essential" across a district.<p><hr><h2>The Ground Rules of Change</h2><hr>An outsider exploring Louisville's schools for evidence of important classroom-level change will find only scattered examples of Essential School principles infully articulated form. But administrators like Debbie Riggs, who coordinatesthe Coalition's efforts in the district, see no cause for discouragement inthis. Perhaps the most effective way to get schools to explore Essential Schoolprinciples, she notes, is very simple: let them do it their way. Teachers andprincipals should see the Coalition not as a program but as a process, sheargues, not as a monolithic model  but as a framework for discussion.<p>   At the same time, Don Ingwerson's administration began early in his term toput in place several key practices that prepared the ground for substantivechange at the classroom level. First, he "flattened the pyramid" ofadministrative bureaucracy so that school principals report directly to him, andgave them far greater autonomy in how they run their schools. Second, heregularly got teachers out of the classroom and into situations where they mightobserve and discuss new ways of teaching. Third, he leaned heavily onLouisville's business community to put money, equipment, and expertise directlyinto the schools. And finally, he gave schools wide freedom to try new things,often as magnet or "learning choice" schools specializing in a particular area,and he let parents and students choose to attend schools out of theirneighborhood as long as a proper racial balance was maintained.<p>   "The result has been a lot of 'little tries'--niches of innovation that leadto bigger changes," says Pat Todd, a 20-year teaching veteran who is nowDirector of School Restructuring for the district. "I like to call it a'centralized  decentralized' reform agenda." Todd works out of the JeffersonCounty Public Schools Gheens Academy, a stylishly remodeled brick elementaryschool building that is the center of the system's professional developmentefforts. (See separate story, page 3.) Begun in 1983 with a $600,000 grant fromLouisville's Gheens Foundation, the Academy appears to be at once catalyst,conceptual center, and communications hub for much of Jefferson County's schoolchange. "Our job is to start things," says Terry Brooks, its director. "We getthem going and give them away." He grins. "We comfort the afflicted and afflictthe comfortable."<p>   What this means in practice is that Jefferson County teachers have a place togo to talk, listen, and try out new things. "We're aiming for nothing less thanan internal transformation of every school and every individual in our system,"says Pat Todd with no trace of irony.<p>   Just what that transformation consists of, however, can prove a delicatequestion for teachers determined not to be the dupes of yet another scheme forquick-fix school reform. "The biggest hurdle we face with respect to theCoalition of Essential Schools," Todd says, "is to get people to realize itisn't a kit you can adopt, but a <i>philosophy</i> of how kids learn, how adults andkids interact." That philosophy can influence the way teachers explore any ofthe newer ideas that present themselves to educators, whether or not theyemanate from Essential School principles. So on a typical day at Gheens Academy,a group of ninth-grade English teachers meet to discuss writing across thecurriculum; another team is developing exercises for cooperative learning;individual teachers use the Curriculum Resource Center to prepare classroommaterials; and beginning teachers meet with their mentor teachers to hash outproblems in their classes. A "student as worker" study group, continuallyshifting in its membership, is planning a special summer school session in whichnew interdisciplinary curricula and exhibitions of mastery can be tried out inclassroom practice with the help of seasoned Essential School people.<p><hr><h2>One Leader, or Many?</h2><hr>How much is Jefferson County's spirit of change due to the influence of a singleleader? Virtually everyone in this system credits Donald Ingwerson with thedramatic differences this district has seen in the decade since he took thesuperintendent's office. Taken alone, the extraordinary length of his tenure hasprovided a stability crucial to the district's progress. But a closer lookreveals just how Ingwerson has operated--not through charisma or high-decibeldemands, but through a quiet, persistent refusal to give up, and the seemingability to make individual people feel personally responsible for the schools'success.<p>   The first challenge Ingwerson faced was a polarized and suspicious schoolboard, weary from years of strife and saddled with a complex and top-heavybureaucracy. "I spent my first year listening, forging relationships with thestaff, and streamlining the bureaucracy," he says. But the bigger job was evenmore fundamental: the teachers and the administration did not share the samevocabulary or the same motivations. "Teachers were concerned with students andwith union issues; principals were concerned with management," Ingwerson says."We began a five-year plan to create a common vision, centered around how tohelp children be successful."<p>   At the same time, the superin-tendent got out into the community, speaking tochurch and business groups of his conviction that every child can learn. "Thatwas a new idea to many of them," he comments. "They hadn't experienced it intheir own lives, perhaps." During his first year, he went "toe-to-toe" with thebusiness community, he says: "I embarrassed them into appointing me to theircommittees. Then I took every opportunity to ask them point-blank what THEY weredoing to help our children." Whether the answer was to donate used furniture orequipment to schools, to form job internships for students, or to donate moneyfor special causes, the strategy has clearly worked; over 700 business-schoolpartnerships on every scale now exist in Jefferson County schools.<p>   "Don is a master at bringing people along," says Fairdale's Marilyn Hohmann."He won't take no for an answer from the school board, but he never forces anissue. He'll go back a dozen times if he has to, discussing ideas for changeuntil people feel comfortable with the concepts." In fact, Ingwerson's stylereflects an abiding, almost religious faith that no limits can block progress ifsufficient will is there. "I go to meetings where the problems are so huge thatyou could easily cry doom and gloom," he says serenely. "I just ask, 'What wouldyou do if you had no limits, if you could wipe the slate clean? Could you getthe job done if you had a billion dollars?' Very often, the answers are right infront of you. The limits are illusory--it's the motivation that's missing. Thelonger you're in a job, the more narrow your scope of what's acceptable tends toget. We need to take off those blinders to really get hold of our problems."<p>   While insisting that every person in the district take active part in thereform process, Ingwerson also made it easier for them to do so. He eliminatedan entire level of middle management jobs--regional superintendents, directors ofinstruction, coordinators of supply services--placing many of those people intojobs opened by attrition, but saving a million dollars to use for otherpurposes. He concentrated all staff development activities in the new GheensAcademy. He identified certain people as system-wide "lightning rods" totrouble-shoot problems in areas such as supplies and maintenance, then gaveprincipals carte blanche to call him if they didn't get results in 24 hours. Andin every school whose faculty so voted, he authorized decision making byparticipatory management, involving faculty and parents in key decisionsconcerning virtually every aspect of schooling. Of the county's 160 schools, 130already have voted to govern themselves this way, and the rest appear to belining up to join them.<p>   Principals and teachers both are warm in their praise for the moves. "Thebest job in Jefferson County right now is to be a principal," says Jim Sexton,whose position as executive director of high school principals was eliminated,and who now heads Eastern High School. "You know you're responsible for makingthings better, and it's enjoyable." He particularly cites the wide latitudeprincipals have in making management decisions within their schools. In hisfirst year as principal, for example, Sexton's teachers told him tardiness wastheir single biggest complaint; without delay he instituted a strict "zerotolerance" policy for lateness to class, and has reduced the problem by 60percent.<p>   "The only mortal sin in this district is not to be collegial," MarilynHohmann says. "The more you share decision making with teachers, the more theyact that way with kids in the classroom. It's a lot easier to tell people whatto do and then pretend they do it." Jim Sexton agrees; the more responsibilityhe passes on, he says, the more effective his school is. "Next we're going totry arena scheduling," he says, "where the kids will design their own schedulesaround the particular teachers they want. It's a way of involving kids in theirown destinies, and puts pressure on teachers to improve their classes if theywant to attract students." Though such tactics do not in themselves reflectEssential School ideas, they can open schools to the notion that students areactive and questioning workers, not passive recipients of whatever is fed them.<p>   When principals are resistant to innovation, Ingwerson has a reputation forswift action. "He doesn't fire people," Hohmann says. "He moves them to lessdemanding jobs." Principals are evaluated, Jim Sexton notes, by peer groups ofthree or four, and encouraged to develop new skills through Gheens Academy'sleadership programs for current and aspiring principals.<p>   The district also works hard to coach teachers, and to prepare them forpositions of leadership within and outside the school. Those teachers who attendworkshops at Gheens Academy, for example, will often later lead their colleaguesin staff workshops on the same subjects. The teacher evaluation process exertsanother steady pressure to try new ideas. "Teachers are required to make anindividual growth plan for themselves," says Kathryn Hopper, who is principal ofWaggener High School. "When I evaluate them, we confer first on what their goalsare, then after the observation we confer again, and write a narrativeevaluation. Every principal and assistant principal in the district is trainedin this kind of clinical supervision." Teachers like the evaluation process,they say, because it honors their own perceptions and personal style. "It's asystem that's built on respect," says Conway Middle School teacher BarbaraStaples. (See separate story, Figure 3)<p><hr><h2>Who Tries It, and How?</h2><hr>"Districtwide, most teachers still see the Coalition as somebody else's program,not something that has to do with them," says Kathryn Hopper. At Waggener, whichis known for its programs for gifted students, some teachers think theCoalition's ideas work only for the most able students. But when Hopper wasassistant principal at Fairdale, she says, "we came to the Coalition because itsideas work for at-risk kids." Earlier, when she taught at Seneca High School,Hopper helped develop a ninth-grade Essential School team specifically forproblem students; she now feels that a heterogeneous group works better.<p>   The fact is that almost every Coalition member school in Jefferson County isgoing about things in its own fashion and at its own pace. Fairdale High is abeehive of individual and team innovations, from a ninth-grade team of seventeachers and 130 students to an interdisciplinary American studies program forjuniors, organized around "essential questions." At Eastern High, Jim Sextonsearches out teachers certified in several fields as a tool to get the number ofstudents a teacher sees in a day down to a manageable level. The school, acounty magnet for math, business, and technology, was just selected to receive amajor IBM grant through the Coalition, aimed at developing a curriculum based ongraduation exhibitions. Iroquois High School has some team teaching now, butnext year it will inaugurate a new longer-block schedule that invites much more.(See separate story, Figure 4) Students at Seneca High, the county's liberalarts magnet school, take three interdisciplinary, thematic, team-taught courseseach year as well as their regular math and language courses. And at Waggener,individual teachers are beginning to come up with imaginative interdisciplinaryperformance-based projects and share them with others throughout the district.<p>   "I don't put teachers into a program," says Waggener's Kathryn Hopper. "Ijust let them see a new method of teaching." Her attitude is shared by most ofthe county's other principals; in fact, to be much more directive would bedifficult, given the trend toward participatory management in this district. Inaddition, Jefferson County's climate of change and choice makes it moreattractive for a school to differentiate its program from others, not to imitateanother's path.<p>   Given all this, the district's Coalition member schools may seem more apatchwork quilt than part of a formally designed and integrated pattern. As yet,Jefferson County has no fully articulated example of Essential School principlesat work. Largely because of the Gheens Academy, however, the underlying ideasbehind the Coalition are slowly spreading. Even teachers who speak disdainfullyor defensively about "Coalition" may nonetheless be trying out cooperativelearning or abandoning lectures in their classrooms, unaware that these ideasare shared by many schools in the Coalition. As the state moves toward requiredperformance-based assessments, teachers are even more likely to adopt ideas likeexhibitions when they encounter them in workshops and seminars. Programs offeredby CES's home offices at Brown University also add enrichment to the local menuof development opportunities. Next year, for example, eight CES-trainedJefferson County teachers and principals will be working with their peers onEssential School ideas, as Citibank Coalition Faculty and Thompson Fellows.<p>   An important link in the chain of reform is how new teachers are trained inuniversity education programs. Here too, the county is taking major steps thatfavor Essential schooling; the University of Louisville will conduct a teachereducation course at Fairdale High School next year, with Fairdale staff servingas instructors along with professors. "It's unheard of for high schools even tobe <i>talking</i> to universities as much as we do, much less helping them redesigntheir curriculum," says Marilyn Hohmann.<p><hr><h2>What's Left to Do?</h2><hr>Ten years after its new superintendent arrived, Jefferson County looks and feelslike an entirely different school system in some important ways.  The district'sadministrative structure has changed; people are talking in new ways to eachother. Teachers and principals feel a new sense of ownership, and businesses aremore involved in the schools than they have ever been. A tone prevails ofchoice, diversity, and innovation.<p>   The district is not without its problems: racial tensions persist; oldclassroom habits of passivity are slow to change; the elite "advanced" studentsstill follow a separate track of self-fulfilling privilege. A relatively smallpercentage of teachers actually participate in Gheens workshops on curriculum,pedagogy, and assessment; and schools vary as to how systematically the ideasare shared with other teachers back at school. There is the ever-presentresistance of the rank and file to what some regard as an elite vanguard ofchange. To carry off a more sustained commitment to bringing every teacher alongwould require expenditures that this county--which spends near the top in a statethat falls 39th in the nation's school spending--may not be willing to make.<p>   But a stable infrastructure of support has been devised at the upper levelsof this system, without which fundamental changes from the bottom up cannotpossibly take place. Don Ingwerson's remark to Marilyn Hohmann at the athleticbanquet last year is a sober recognition of just how long it takes to get to thehardest part of school change--what goes on in the classroom between teacher andstudent. In that realm, this superintendent believes, Jefferson County's task isjust beginning.<p>   "We must get to the point where the child is going to school because he wantsto learn," he says. "Our job is to motivate that spirit of inquiry, to carry itinto the ways we assess student performance." That spirit must be nurtured verycarefully, he warns, starting with an absolute commitment to involve parents inwhat their children are doing, to give them enough choices about theirchildren's schooling that they are invested in the results. "The glue that holdsthe system together is very sensitive to temperature," he says. "If you get tooconfident, if you try to launch something when it's too hot, the whole thingwill blow up in your face."<p>   What he hopes to see in the next decade, the superintendent says, is moreteam efforts both in and out of the schools--"parents and children in theclassrooms, kids coming and going." He wants "a higher standard of learning, ofteaching, of behavior, and more <i>individual</i> standards and ways of working withkids. We need to move to personalize our system, to get the number of students ateacher sees down to 80 in a day. We won't accomplish anything until we knowwhat we want to <i>do</i> with the job--until the fundamental question is what resultsin better student learning," Ingwerson concludes. "The child is not there forthe school; the school has got to be there for the child."<p><hr>                    <h2>Jefferson County's Profile</h2><hr><b>STUDENT ENROLLMENT:</b> 93,000 (includes preschool and adult high school)<p><b>PER-PUPIL EXPENDITURE: </b>$3,815<p><b>160 SCHOOLS, </b>including 88 elementary, 23 middle, and 20 high schools, plus 29 special and technical schools<p><b>KENTUCKY RANKS </b>39th in the nation on school spending;<p><b>JEFFERSON COUNTY'S SPENDING</b> falls 4th in the state<p><hr><h2>                                   Figure 1:                        The Infrastructure of Innovation:                  Jefferson County's Staff Development Academy</h2><hr>   How does a district foster change and growth across its entire public schoolsystem, not just in a few "special" schools, or with a few extraordinaryindividuals? Jefferson County decided a decade ago that the answer lay inlinking school improvement explicitly to the professional growth of teachers,administrators, and support staff. With the help of a $600,000 grant from thelocal Gheens Foundation, the district established a Professional DevelopmentAcademy which since 1983 has become the heart of Jefferson County's system. Thechief objective of the JCPS/Gheens Academy, as it is known, was to foster aculture of innovation and entrepreneurship that would permeate every school, andto provide an infrastructure to support such change.<p>   Forging links with the Coalition of Essential Schools was only one step theAcademy took toward that end. In addition, it encouraged schools to become"professional development schools," early examples of school-based participatoryplanning. It set up a system of "learning choice schools," which target certaincurriculum areas (such as mathematics or technology) for special emphasis. Andit urged middle schools to enter on the pioneering national Middle GradesAssessment Program.<p>   As well as linking Jefferson County to these national efforts, theJCPS/Gheens Academy provided technical assistance and services to anyone in thedistrict who could use it, including private and parochial school teachers,university faculty, and student teachers. An education library, a  curriculumresource center, a special education materials center, a computer educationsupport unit, and a grants assistance office are some of the resources availablethrough the Academy.<p>   A key focus of the Academy is on working with principals and otheradministrators. Its "leadership academy" aims both to provide development andsupport for current principals and to identify and educate potential principalsin matters from teaching to organizational effectiveness.<p>   Gheens has sponsored teacher study groups, travel grants, mentorships forbeginning teachers, and many other short-term projects. "A school system worksin three ways: maintenance, incremental improvement, and innovation," says TerryBrooks, its director. "Our job is innovation."<p>   Brooks calls the $400,000 annual commitment of Gheens Foundation money"venture capital," small in proportion to Jefferson County's $380 million annualbudget (which contributes 88 percent of the Academy's cost). But it is moneythat helps leverage other direct and indirect support for the school system,through business partnerships and other foundations. In the meantime, Gheens isbusy monitoring and evaluating its own work, hoping that results will show thatprivate funds can help substantially--not to accomplish a "quick fix" of atroubled school system, but to build a stable and continuing infrastructure tosupport long-term change.<p><hr>                                  <h2> Figure 2:                           Starting Over from Scratch:                       Kentucky's Education Reform of 1990</h2><hr>   In a stunning decision that forced educational change of an order rarely seenin this country, Kentucky's Supreme Court in 1989 ruled the entire state publicschool system unconstitutional because of substantial inequities in the level ofschool funding in different districts. The state was told to throw out its lawson education and to rewrite them in a form that would guarantee the same levelof opportunity for every student. The result was the groundbreaking EducationReform Act of 1990, known as House Bill 940, which went far beyond equalizingfunding to require dramatic changes in management, curriculum, and assessmentpractices.<p>   In the process of researching the Reform Act, the legislative task forcecalled on many educators with close ties to the Coalition of Essential Schools,including Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, andGrant Wiggins, whose work on exhibitions of mastery has shaped much of theCoalition's thought. Their influence is clear from the shape of the final Act;it calls for statewide performance-based assessment of students by 1995-96,mandates more opportunities for teachers to improve their classroom instruction,and requires school-based decision making, including parent participation, inevery district. By 1993, a "model curriculum framework" will be provided by theState Board of Education to local schools; its emphasis is on developing thefollowing abilities:<p><ul>   <li>to use basic communication and math skills for situations students will         encounter throughout their lives    <li>to apply principles from math, sciences, arts, humanities, and practical         living studies to situations they will encounter throughout their lives     <li>to become self-sufficient individuals  <li>to become responsible members of a family, work group, or community <li>to think and solve problems in school situations and in life   <li>to connect and integrate experiences and new knowledge with what one has         previously learned, and build on past learning experiences to acquire         new information through various sources.</ul><p>   Schools that increase their proportion of successful students--defined asthose who make a successful transition to work, post-secondary education, andthe military--will receive financial rewards, and school staff members willdecide how those funds are to be spent. Those in trouble will embark on a crisisprogram, working with "distinguished educators" and special funds to bring aboutmore rapid change.<p><hr>                                  <h2> Figure 3:                Cross-Disciplinary Teaming and Active Learning:                            The Middle School Model</h2>   Ever since it sprang from a major study of American high schools and thepublication of Theodore Sizer's book <i>Horace's Compromise</i>, the Coalition ofEssential Schools has seen itself primarily as a high school reform movement.But some of the healthiest examples of Essential School principles and pedagogycan be found at the middle school level. A well-established national movementtoward "developmentally appropriate" education in early adolescence has led towidespread acceptance in middle schools of cross-disciplinary and team teaching,strategies to promote active and collaborative learning, and personal attentionto individual students' progress.<p>   Far from being an exception to this middle school reform trend, JeffersonCounty is one of its leaders. Nearly all of its 23 middle schools have alreadygone through the schoolwide soul-searching involved in the Middle GradesAssessment Program (developed by the Ford Foundation and North Carolina'spioneering Center for Early Adolescence). The changes that followed were subtleat first, as teachers began to see themselves as the architects of change intheir schools. But they soon burgeoned into a thriving culture of empowerment;middle school teachers are among the most energized and satisfied people workingin this school district today.<p>   "The best middle schools are a combination of the best elementary and thebest high school people," says Barbara Staples, a 24-year teaching veteran whoworks at Conway Middle School, which reflects many Essential School principlesthough it is not a CES member. In its sixth year of change since teachers therevoted to restructure their school, Conway is organized around seveninterdisciplinary teams of four to six teachers each. Each team has a commonplanning period, its own budget, and the flexibility to schedule to meet itsstudents' particular needs. Most teams serve one grade level only, but one is amulti-age group, and another focuses primarily on the arts.<p>   Perhaps because they were not wedded to the more specialized subject-areafocus of the conventional high school curriculum, Conway teachers were able towork closely in these teams on setting new learning goals for their students."Before this, most of us were typical junior-high teachers," Staples says."Students didn't come first; we just wanted them to stay in their seats." Shecredits principal Dennis Boswell with pushing teachers to take new risks in theclassroom, and to open themselves up to suggestions and non-evaluative coachingby their peers.<p>   "At the start of the school year we all go on a two-day staff retreat at anout-of-town hotel," she says. At one such gathering, Staples and co-teacherSusan Sharp led a workshop on "student as worker," and when school started theymade themselves available to other teachers who were trying out new ideas in theclassroom. Conway has a grant for two "coordinating teachers" who take others'classes during such times, underlining the school's commitment to classroom-level change.<p>   "The system is built on respect, on working with someone's strengths,"Staples says. "There is a <i>personal</i> aspect to being willing to try all this--theteam is truly a family. Even a conservative teacher is often willing to trysomething new just to keep the flow of the group going."<p>   Cross-disciplinary teams meet daily to plan curriculum and activities, butConway's departments also meet monthly--both to discuss active learning as itapplies in their disciplines, and to ensure a sense of continuous subject-areaprogress across the grades. "At the high-school level this kind of thing willtake on its own form," Barbara Staples says. But for an example of how tostructure a school around cross-disciplinary learning, she believes, highschools could do worse than to look at Conway's plan. And the experience hasclearly given Conway's teachers new energy and professional pride. "After 24years I don't know the meaning of burnout," Staples says. "Teaching is morewonderful every day."<p><hr>                                 <h2>  Figure 4:                            One School's First Step:                 Changing the Schedule to Get the Numbers Down</h2><hr>   In a bold step designed to dramatically reduce the number of studentsteachers see in a semester, Iroquois High School will launch a "Macro-classOptional Program" in the coming school year. The program redesigns the school'sschedule into three 100-minute blocks, punctuated at midday by a 70-minute lunchand activity period. During its first year, it will coexist alongside thetraditional six-period Iroquois schedule, with teachers moving freely from oneto the other; but after three years Principal Stuart Watts expects all Iroquoisstudents to be in macro-classes. "The longer blocks provide a format in whichour commitment to Essential School principles can grow and thrive," he says.<p>   "This gets teachers down to being responsible for 75 kids over the course ofa semester," says Watts. Though it also means 25 minutes more teaching time, 96percent of Iroquois faculty voted for the new system, in which they teach amaximum of three classes per day. Teachers may also teach two classes andsponsor activities, or team with other teachers in interdisciplinary classes.About 20 percent more classes can be offered under the new procedure, whichdecreases the number of students in each class. The length of the school day andthe calendar year will not change.<p>   Modeled after educator Joseph M. Carroll's "Copernican Plan," the new systemworks by separating subjects into intensive one-semester units, rather thanspreading them out over the school year. In the first half of the year, astudent might take only English, math, and a foreign language; in the secondhalf she could switch to social studies, science, health, and music. At the endof the year, she will have accumulated six course credits, and Carnegie unitrequirements will have been met. Still, Theodore Sizer cautions, nothing aboutthe Copernican schedule guarantees depth in the curriculum, which he believescannot come with focusing only on coverage.<p>   Watts hopes that the longer blocks will foster more opportunities tointegrate community resources and job partnerships, and more attention tomeasuring student progress on an individual level. "We have a lot of challengesin this school," he says, "including attendance rates, dropouts, and a very highpercentage of at-risk and ESL kids." An emphasis on demonstrated mastery--ratherthan a checklist approach to minimum competency--will characterize Iroquoismacro-classrooms.<p> <hr>                             <h2> Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or comingeditions.

But behind thatappearance a whole new way of talking about teaching and learning is in the air--in the halls and the faculty lounges, among parents, students, and teachers. Andout of that conversation ambitious changes are stirring. "By next year at thistime," principal Dick Amman declares, "our goal is to come up with analternative schedule, a new curriculum design, and a plan that uses advisors tohelp students assemble graduation portfolios representing the best of what theyknow and can do."<p>   Central to these goals is Pueblo's commitment to a whole-school consensus onthe changes, which revolve around the Nine Common Principles of the EssentialSchool movement--though as little as one year ago only 35 percent of its teacherseven felt change was needed. Already this year, a committee of Pueblo studentshave met to put the Common Principles into their own words, and 85 percent ofthe teachers have endorsed the document. And the school's steering committee,made up of community leaders as well as students and staff, is solidly behindthe proposed changes. Formally and informally, in ways overt and subtle, peoplehere are talking with each other continually about what they want their schoolto be like.<p>   If Essential School change is to take hold and endure, its advocatesmaintain, the importance of talk like this cannot be ignored. "It's tempting forcritics to dismiss our emphasis on this as sentimental," says Theodore Sizer,who has long called the Coalition of Essential Schools "a conversation amongfriends." In fact, he argues, "conversation is <i>fundamental</i> to school change.Without it, schools will go nowhere; with it, they will succeed." But how can aschool achieve the kind of involvement among its staff, its students, and itscommunity that places like Pueblo demonstrate? How does it even know what totalk about? What does it take to get those opposed to any change talking aboutnew ideas? And how can the conversation, once begun, be nurtured and sustainedso that school people's sense of their own professionalism will thrive andflower?<p><hr><h2>Why Bother to Talk?</h2><hr>In the typical isolation of the American school workplace, the barriers toconversation are formidable, research has shown. As Susan Moore Johnson pointsout in her 1990 book <i>Teachers at Work</i>, most teachers have little systematiccontact with each other; they see students only in the classroom and do notusually discuss them with their colleagues. Rarely do they turn to each otherfor help on instructional matters, and rarely do schools encourage collaborationby setting up structures that support it. "The last time many teachers routinelytalked about issues of education was probably in graduate school," says theCoalition's Beverly Simpson, who works with schools at the start of theirinvolvement.<p>   With the full weight of that status quo against them, some school people,excited by Theodore Sizer's ideas, have tried getting an Essential Schoolprogram going more or less on their own--as a school within a school, forexample. But seven years of Essential School experience shows that suchdecisions are likely to backfire. "If you don't include people in theconversation, they feel excluded; and excluded people make things fail," saysCES Director for Schools Bob McCarthy.<p>   Back in 1984, for example, a small group of interested teachers at Houston'sWestbury High School started meeting as "Horace's Company," discussing theCoalition's Nine Common Principles and how they could try them out. Westburybecame a charter member of the Coalition, but the effort remained a school-within-a-school; a succession of principals was only one of the reasons that therest of its faculty never became actively engaged in talking through EssentialSchool ideas and practices. After a close faculty vote against whole-schoolinvolvement, Westbury temporarily shut the program down and went back to theplanning stages, this time taking deliberate steps to build dialogue into everyteacher's day. Today, the school is steadily transforming its structure, and itpredicts all of its 2,000 students and 97 teachers will be working withEssential School ideas within a year. Many of the most resistant faculty, likeshop or art teachers who saw their subjects as threatened by change, are nowcontributing key guidance as the whole school readies to introduce graduationexhibitions, says Karen Owen, Westbury's Essential School coordinator.<p>   The conversation's aim, however, cannot be to put in place a predeterminedagenda of Essential School reform. Instead, Ted Sizer emphasizes, it has to havea democratic focus; each school must find its own ways to work through itsparticular challenges. But conversation is the necessary medium to do this, heargues, and so setting up a context of collegiality in which it can thrive mustbe a school's first task.<p><hr><h2>New Conditions, New Norms</h2><hr>"Collegial workplaces depend on teachers' openness and readiness to improve,"Susan Moore Johnson concludes in <i>Teachers at Work</i>. They must also have"reference groups of peers for identifying problems and taking action; ampletime for observation and discussion; and administrators who both encourageteachers and accommodate their needs as they explore new collegialrelationships." When all these pieces are in place, it appears, a new traditionof collaboration starts to exert its own force, causing people to rely upon itfor solutions as subsequent situations arise.<p>   The experience of the thirty schools involved in the Eight-Year Study of theProgressive Education Association in the 1930s is good evidence of this. (SeeHORACE, Volume 8, No. 1.) In this large-scale experiment, thousands of teacherstook bold risks to rethink and change what went on in their classrooms; theywere given carte blanche by college admissions officers who guaranteed theirstudents would not be penalized because of unconventional curricula. The studywas abruptly brought to a close as World War II began, but it had lasted longenough to establish a new standard of what was acceptable and desirable in ahigh school education. According to some educators looking back on the movement,most of this happened through teachers talking together at the grassroots level,and gathered strength as they realized their freedom to express and try out newideas over time. "The very ways people looked at high schools began to change,"says Sizer. "The Eight-Year Study legitimized a national discourse that calledfor much more student engagement with their work, in ways that mirror many ofthe ideas the Coalition now stands for."<p>   Small schools have a distinct advantage over larger ones in creating theconditions for conversation, as do independent schools over public ones, SusanJohnson's research shows. Both face fewer bureaucratic and organizationalobstacles to informal encounters. Among today's Essential schools, one of thelongest-standing traditions of an active conversation about teaching andlearning is that of the 320-student Thayer High School in Winchester, NewHampshire. Thayer is small enough that people can hardly avoid conversation; andits principal, Dennis Littky, promotes teacher-talk with unflagging energy and aseemingly endless stream of strategies.<p>   Every Friday Littky's T.G.I.F. memo is required faculty reading, an exuberantamalgam of his reflections and questions, copies of provocative articles, listsof the subjects and times of the next week's meetings, and other diverse items.Two years ago, Littky passed out "those hardbound journals with pretty covers"to his staff in which they could correspond with him weekly about anything theychose. ("I find out things they'd never say in person," he says.) He circulatesa videotape interviewing each teaching team for five minutes on its progress; heoperates a consulting stable of Thayer teachers who are hired to travel andlecture; he brainstorms with teams on new strategies for parent involvement. Acable television program called "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere" is in the works,to be an interactive training tool for teachers nationwide. At weekly hour-longfaculty meetings, small groups bring together teachers from adjacent grades orrelated subject areas to work on curriculum and other questions. "We take turnsbringing good food to the meetings," says Dennis. "And I call them off after anhour. They've gotta be fun." On their own, Thayer's teachers go much further;it's common for teams to meet outside school weekly for intensive planningsessions, at a local deli or a teacher's home.<p>     Partly because Thayer has been at it so long--longer than the Coalition hasexisted--the school has developed its own culture of conversation, creating newnorms for how to deal with conflict, risk, or change. "People come to depend onit for direction over time," CES senior researcher Rick Lear says. "It becomes atouchstone; when people get tired or things get difficult, they're able to lookback and say, "We talked about that, and here's why we decided what we did."<p>   Creating those new norms in a larger organization can be an arduous process;many in the Coalition argue it can only happen, in fact, when schools are brokeninto separately managed units of around 500 or fewer students. However it iscarried out, a number of linked conditions appear to be crucial to the process:<p><ul><li>Ample paid or release timefor reflection and conversation, not just as retreats and "day-away" programs,but built into the teachers' daily schedule.<li>A small enough student loadso that teachers know their students well, and have the energy to think and talkcreatively about their needs.<li>Arranging school space, from lunchrooms to faculty lounges, soas to make conversations natural, attractive, and easy.<li>Public and positive feedbackby the administration for taking risks in the classroom, even if they do notalways succeed.<li>Periodic grouping of teachers with others who can help them, whether acrossgrades, across disciplines, or across institutional boundaries.<li>Regular meetings of the entire    faculty to address substantiveeducational issues over which they    have real power. <li>Involving virtually every teacher in shaping some aspect of what is atstake.<li>The inclusion in the conversation of students, parents, and teachers notin the vanguard of change.</ul><p><hr><h2>How to Include Everyone?</h2><hr>Given how hard it is to bring about even one of these conditions, it is nowonder that so many member schools in the Coalition's first years chose to passup the last three points and start with a school-within-a-school structure.Patrick McQuillan and Donna Muncey, who have followed the Coalition's progressin depth for several years, have analyzed several such situations as part oftheir School Ethnography Project. Schools that start this way, they note, do sobelieving they can start up Essential School practices cautiously and at lesscost, while preserving the peace among a faculty that did not always agree onthe need for change. Invariably, however, the school-within-a-school efforts raninto even bigger troubles because they were separate from the rest of theirschools. Their teachers were resented for receiving special treatment, likesmaller student loads and extra planning periods. With everyone's eyes on thenew program, Essential School proponents felt pressure to publicize its success,making it hard to distinguish between real educational progress and publicrelations, and inviting the insulting impression that the rest of the school wassomehow mediocre. Though in most cases the programs were intended to expandeventually into the whole school, uninvolved faculty often felt ill-informed asto what Essential Schools were about, and wary about extending practices likeinterdisciplinary efforts and longer-block scheduling that they saw asthreatening their own domain. In the end, the conversation about school changewas actually limited by the school-within-a-school choice, not promoted by it.<p>   If things start to go wrong like this for an Essential School, McQuillan andMuncey warn, they may never go right again. Insiders to the program becomeexhausted with the continual political divisiveness, they say; outsiders hardentheir stances against changes in their teaching practices; and faculty relations(which historically are relatively tension-free compared to tensions betweenfaculty and administration or teachers and students) only deteriorate with time.Successful Essential schools, say these observers, "cannot afford to focuspurely on philosophical or pedagogical issues, or even structural concerns."Instead, right from the start they must give plenty of <i>political</i> attention tomaking everyone feel part of the new picture.<p>   What techniques prove effective for getting this kind of whole-schoolparticipation going? "The evidence is that during the first year of planning,teachers need to move <i>outside</i> the school structure if they are to talk aboutideas of teaching and learning," says CES's Bob McCarthy. Many Essentialschools, for example, schedule a one- or two-day staff retreat where teachersare introduced to the Nine Common Principles and encouraged to brainstorm aboutways they fit into their practice. (See figure 1) Other schools systematicallysend teachers to regional symposia, introductory workshops, or other offeringsof CES or regional and Re:Learning efforts.  "By the second year," McCarthysays, "they begin to build the conversation into their ordinary schoolstructure--through faculty meetings, study groups, or task forces to report backto the whole staff."<p>   But having a direct, clear, and productive conversation about matters onwhich people disagree strongly is a skill that does not come easily, especiallyin a profession as isolating as the classroom teacher's. For this reason, somecontend that any staff efforts must include training in discussion and decision-making skills. This is a key focus of  national programs such as the CitibankFaculty and the Thomson Fellows, which trains Coalition teachers andadministrators in facilitation skills they then use in extended work with one ortwo client schools. Some schools also use consensus training or team-buildingworkshops to get at the same problem.<p>   Many schools, especially those involved in the Coalition's Trek experience,have used two excellent videotapes to spark their initial reexamining of valuesand priorities. "The Power of Vision" and "The Business of Paradigms," bothhosted by Joel Barker, are available at discounted rates to educationalorganizations through Charthouse International Learning Corporation (1-800-328-3789). Other schools have taken advantage of "coalition-building" workshops andmaterials available through the Education Commission of the States, whichspecifically aim to bring more of the community into the conversation.<p>   Calling on every teacher to contribute something to the effort has proved aneffective way tostrengthen communication and unity for many schools. When themove to whole-school involvement finally did come at Westbury, says coordinatorKaren Owen, all teachers of core subjects joined teams. The ones who had alreadybeen involved with Essential School ideas were urged to continue, "but withteachers who were brand new to it, we only asked that they meet and talk to eachother as professionals about their kids," Owen says. "They didn't have to dointerdisciplinary work or anything else, just meet and learn how to work as ateam. For the most part teachers were so excited to have a team to rely on--toshare students, share problems, and offer suggestions--that they actually didmore, even though they weren't required to." This year Westbury moved further,asking every team to talk about how it would handle attendance, discipline, andinterdisciplinary questions. Elective teachers are not on core teams, Owen says,but they are often asked in to give input about students, and they dominate thecommittee that is writing the proposal for graduation exhibitions. "Many of theelective fields are performance oriented, such as industrial technology, homeeconomics, music, and physical education," says Owen. "They can really helpalong some of the more academic teachers."<p><hr><h2>What to Talk About?</h2><hr>Once the climate for conversation is secure and teachers feel encouraged to talkfreely, what do they talk about? "One of the big differences between theCoalition and other restructuring movements," says Bob McCarthy, "is that itoffers substantive and intellectual content. In that sense the Nine CommonPrinciples provide a new structure for change--an intellectual structure."<p>   Hashing out what those common principles mean--rephrasing them, noting wherethey are already being realized in a school, identifying what would be hardestor easiest about translating them into practice--is one of the most effectiveways to get the Essential School conversation going, CES staff people say.Another way into the conversation is to ask every teacher, especially those whohave not been in the vanguard of change, to help shape the answer to "What do wewant our students to know and be able to do on graduation?" At Parkway SouthHigh School, near St. Louis, Missouri, a Danforth Foundation planning grant of$100,000 freed more than a dozen teachers for two hours daily to hash out a setof six interdisciplinary "proficiency areas" the whole faculty could agree on asgraduation requirements. Elected by their departments, few of these teacherswere already deeply involved with Essential School ideas, and principal CraigLarson had no guarantee that the group would eventually integrate those ideasinto the graduation guidelines. "They had more to read and absorb at the startbecause they were unfamiliar with the concepts," he said. "But in the end theirenthusiasm carried more weight with their departments, because they couldidentify and sympathize with people who were suspicious of the new ideas." Goingback again and again to their colleagues for feedback, these teachers worked andreworked the proficiency guidelines until they had articulated not only theminimum graduation requirements but a higher level, called "mastery," as well.Subcommittees also studied other areas of change, like proposed schedule changesand advisory groups. This year, against considerable odds, this 2,000-studentsuburban high school has made several significant steps toward whole-schoolinvolvement with Essential schooling.<p>   Sometimes a school comes to the Essential School conversation indirectly,through another movement that reflects many of the same ideas. Over the courseof three  years, for instance, some 30 to 40 teachers from the Croton-Harmonschool district in New York's Hudson River Valley have been released forfourteen school days a year to attend a workshop about writing across thecurriculum. The experience challenged their assumptions about teaching andlearning in ways that were sometimes uncomfortable, says Croton-Harmon HighSchool's Chris Louth, who now coordinates the Essential School effort there."But it sent a clear message that this was time valued by the school district.And the aim was always to talk out our responses, to make the writing workshopreflect our own thoughts." When principal Sherry King invited teachers to starttalking about Essential School ideas, "they fit right into what we had alreadybeen talking about," Louth says. Pueblo County's school district does somethingsimilar by sending dozens of personnel, from principals to custodians, fortraining in the consensus method of making decisions. "It makes talking abouteverything from school change to labor disputes a much better experience foreverybody," says principal Dick Amman.<p><hr><h2>Where Does Talk Get You?</h2><hr>Early results from the Coalition's pilot study in the Taking Stock effortsuggest that teachers linked with Essential School efforts do talk more witheach other about the ideas of teaching and learning than their colleagues intraditional school structures. But conversation IS merely sentimental if it doesnot result in real improvement at the classroom level--if students are not moredeeply engaged because of what their teachers are doing with Essential Schoolideas. "A lot can talk the talk," Bob McCarthy cautions, "but not many can walkthe walk."<p>   Aside from pointing to specific schools' increased student success--both onquantifiable levels like attendance and in more intangible aspects likeengagement and school climate--how can you tell if conversation will make anydifference in the long run? Some evidence comes from looking at other movementsof classroom change--the practice of teaming teachers in middle school, forexample, or the "whole language" trend that links reading and writing across thedisciplines. In both cases, only when teachers really began to talk about thenew ideas--and to change their practices because they believed that kids would dobetter that way--did the movement really take hold and spread. "It doesn't reallymatter if these ideas originate at the university level or the classroom level,"says CES senior researcher Rick Lear. "But if teachers don't talk about it andcome to believe in it, no matter how good an idea is, the actual practice won'tchange--and ultimately student achievement won't change either. Talk enablesstructural changes."<p>   To be effective, a conversation among teachers has to continue, creating newnorms and rebuilding consensus as time goes by. "People keep asking me, "How arethings going?" Craig Larson says. "It's tempting to give an easy answer: ÔWeplanned for three years and now we've changed this and that, and everything'sfine.' But the real answer is that collaboration and change never end--it has togo on all the time."<p>   Talk travels, from schoolhouse to statehouse, from the academy to theclassroom and back. When he speaks of his "conversation among friends," TedSizer is actually aiming to bring alive a new national discourse, in which ideasabout teaching and learning are slowly shifting at every level. He jokes withSizer, Bob McCarthy says, about holding that conversation with a bullhorn among10,000 friends at St. Louis's Busch Stadium, as the Essential Schools effortgains momentum. But school change does not happen in a stadium, no matter howinspiring the speech. It happens at levels at once more modest and moreenduring, between individual people involved in teaching and learning, as theybegin to talk freely to each other, and to trust that if they speak their voiceswill be heard. <p><hr>         <h2>    Figure 1: Conversation Starters: Some Key Questions</h2><hr>The Coalition has used this technique in beginning the conversation at schoolsin the exploratory stages. In groups of around five people, consider a few ofthe following questions. (Warning: Pick only one set of these questions; to"cover" all of them will only lead to superficial conversations.) For each one,come up with three answers to share with the larger group, and then let thewhole group "cook down" the list to no more than five items the whole group canstand behind.<p>                               <h3>        I.</h3><ul><li> What do we want students to know and be able to do when they leave ourschool? What would our school be proud to list on our diploma?<li>What are people like whom we really admire? What do they do? If schoolswere trying to help shape these characteristics, skills, and habits, what kindsof practices and structures would they have to set up?</ul><p><h3>   II.</h3><ul><li>What is the most powerful learning experience you have ever had? Tell thestories, then talk about the characteristics and conditions that made learningpossible.<li>Where in our school are powerful learning experiences already going on?What are the teaching strategies or other strategies that are allowing it tohappen?  How could we make these conditions possible throughout the wholeschool? What might keep it from happening?</ul><p><h3>   III.</h3><ul><li>Which of the Nine Common Principles would be easiest to adapt in ourschool? Which would be the most difficult? Why?<li>What would be uncomfortable for you personally about starting to work withthe Nine Common Principles? What comfortable? (Don't need to ask why.)<li>If you were going to visit a school where that difficult principle was inpractice, what would you see kids doing?  What would teachers and adults in thebuilding be doing?<li>If you were going to put that principle into practice in your school, whatwould you need to make it happen? From whom do you need these things? Make alist for yourself personally, and one for the staff as a whole.</ul><p><hr>       <h2>    Figure 2: Some Techniques to Keep the Conversation Going</h2><hr><ul><li>Get a diverse student committee to rewrite the Nine Common Principles ofEssential Schools in their own words. Then circulate it among the teachers fortheir reactions.<li>Train people in the consensus method of decision-making, where a decision isarrived at only when everyone agrees to help implement something. This provesuseful for major decisions from contract negotiations to school visionstatements.<li>At a faculty meeting, introduce one Essential School principle; then ask eachteacher to write down its meaning on an index card without using any of thewords in the CES version. Collect the cards and make them into a list to sendevery teacher, showing how many ways each principle can take shape.<li>After faculty members have been introduced to the Nine Common Principles, askdepartment meetings to come up with a list of ways they already carry them out.<li>Ask each department to elect a respected representative--not necessarily anEssential School proponent--to a faculty committee who will be paid or givenrelease time to reflect weekly on the issues that face the school and reportback to their departments. Add a few "at-large" members who may nominatethemselves for election by the full faculty.<li>If teachers tend to eat in department offices, institute a faculty lunchroom,to get members of different departments talking together more regularly.Lengthening the lunch hour helps, too.<li>If your school has a video lab or photography class, videotape 5-minuteinterviews with anyone who is trying new things alone or in teams. Put them allon one tape, make copies, and present them at meetings of other faculty groups.<li>Praise and publicize teachers who are taking risks by departing from time-wornprocedures. Write personal notes to acknowledge their efforts, and send a copyto the central office files.</ul><hr>      <h2>   Figure 3: Conversation Starters: A Discussion About Decency</h2><hr>One way to focus a conversation is to ask participants to discuss in depth oneof the Nine Common Principles as it relates to their school. Principal NeilCulhane of Avon High School in Avon, Connecticut asked his staff to read arecent issue of HORACE that focused on the principle of decency (Volume 7,No. 4), and to talk with each other about the following questions:<p><ul><li>How do we define decency? Is decency a minimum of an expectation, or shouldwe expect a higher standard?<li>How does our school, or your classroom, demonstrate the principle ofdecency?<li>Is having high expectations a sign of respect or an imposition and/or acause  of unnecessary pressure? How do you distinguish between the two? Whendoes high expectation cross the line and become unnecessary pressure?<li>The article describes a "last chance" school effort where teachers pay homevisits to students. What is your response to this? Would you dothis? Is this going beyond the call of duty?<li>The article states, "The best teachers are learners themselves" (page 4).Do you agree with this? What have you learned from your students this year?<li>The issue of tests and grading is raised (page 4). There's an example ofstudents collaborating on tests. What is your reaction to this? Is this"legalized cheating"? What is the purpose of tests? Is a score the onlyindicator of learning? What else would or could you consider as mastery oflearning? <li>If you were limited to having only three rules for the entire school(faculty, students, and all staff) to follow, what would they be? What would theconsequences be for any infractions of the rules?<li>Could our school initiate a plan so that every single student received someform of positive recognition? Is this type of plan necessary? Feasible? What doyou envision it to be?<li> "Conditions in our society have changed to the point where the very normsof respect have altered," Pat Wasley states in the article. Do you agree ordisagree? What conditions do you think she is referring to? Can or shouldteachers do anything about the "changed conditions"?</ul><p><hr>                  <h2>     Figure 4: Conversation Starters:                 Coaches Talk About the Fifth Common Principle</h2><hr>At Fairdale High School in Jefferson County, Kentucky, to extend theconversation about the metaphor of "teacher as coach, student as worker,"several athletic coaches offered the following teaching guidelines in their ownwords.<p><ul> <li>Work specifically on individual weaknesses one on one, demonstrating thecorrect execution of the stroke, etc.<li>Communicate exactly what is expected in terms of punctuality, behavior, andperformance. <li> Plan practice to be challenging but keep some fun in it. Vary what you do--don't let it get monotonous or boring.<li> Model the correct movement and break it down into its basic, fundamentalparts.<li>Have a sense of humor; poke fun at yourself sometimes. Joke with the kidssome to help them relax and enjoy the sport.<li>Let the kids know that you love your job and you care about them and theirsuccess.<p>                          --Lloyd Harris, tennis coach<p><li>Emphasize to all members of the team that it is their team, not the coach'steam. We use the word "our" a lot.<li>The ultimate goal is for the student to take total control of the task athand within the framework of a team concept. We want them at the conclusion tobe able to coach the game themselves. Throughout the season we continue to shiftthe burden of responsibility to the player. It never ceases to amaze me howreadily the student accepts these problem-solving activities under highlystressful conditions.<p>                          --Robert Thompson, assistant football coach<p>  <li>Be open-minded for change--learn from your students. Everyone is different. <li>Treat all students fairly and care about each of them.<li>Involve everyone daily--no standing around. <li>Distribute responsibility, as much as a student will take; don't force it.<li>Instill pride!<li>Be truthful; kids can see right through half-truths and exaggerations. <li>Be enthusiastic, and don't be afraid to show emotions--love is a very strongmotivating factor.<li>Encourage maximum effort daily; emphasize that you play like you practice.<li>Never let a student have two bad days in a row.<p>                          --Mike Fletcher, football coach<p> <li> Personal commitment of time to each player.<li>Teach and reteach; they can't get it right the first time and forever more.<li>Patience--patience--patience. <li> Set goals players can reach.<li>Reward success.<li>Never let one fail; find his success niche.<p>                          --Stanley Hardin, basketball coach<p><li>Set your expectations to the point where they are difficult to obtain, anddon't relax on these expectations. Be consistent!<li> Never leave a kid with a negative feeling about himself or herself. If youhave to correct them, make sure before they leave that you pick them back up.<p>                          --Mark Wilson, assistant football coach<p></ul><hr>          <h2>Figure 5: The Nine Common Principles of Essential Schools</h2><hr><ol><li>The school should focus on helping adolescents learn to use their mindswell. Schools should not attempt to be "comprehensive" if such a claim is madeat the expense of the school's central intellectual purpose.<li> The school's goals should be simple: that each student master a limitednumber of essential skills and areas of knowledge. While these skills and areaswill, to varying degrees, reflect the traditional academic disciplines, theprogram's design should be shaped by the intellectual and imaginative powers andcompetencies that students need, rather than necessarily by "subjects" asconventionally defined. The aphorism "Less Is More" should dominate: curriculardecisions should be guided by the aim of thorough student mastery andachievement rather than by an effort merely to cover content.<li> The school's goals should apply to all students, while the means to thesegoals will vary as those students themselves vary. School practice should betailor-made to meet the needs of every group or class of adolescents.<li>Teaching and learning should be personalized to the maximum feasible extent.Efforts should be directed toward a goal that no teacher have directresponsibility for more than 80 students. To capitalize on this personalization,decisions about the details of the course of study, the use of students' andteachers' time and the choice of teaching materials and specific pedagogies mustbe unreservedly placed in the hands of the principal and staff.<li>  The governing practical metaphor of the school should be student-as-workerrather than the more familiar metaphor of teacher-as-deliverer-of-instructional-services. Accordingly, a prominent pedagogy will be coaching, to provokestudents to learn how to learn and thus to teach themselves.<li>Students entering secondary school studies are those who can show competencein language and elementary mathematics. Students of traditional high school agebut not yet at appropriate levels of competence to enter secondary schoolstudies will be provided intensive remedial work to assist them quickly to meetthese standards. The diploma should be awarded upon a successful finaldemonstration of mastery for graduation -- an "exhibition." This exhibition bythe student of his or her grasp of the central skills and knowledge of theschool's program may be jointly administered by the faculty and by higherauthorities. As the diploma is awarded when earned, the school's programproceeds with no strict age grading and with no system of "credits earned" by"time spent" in class. The emphasis is on the students' demonstration that theycan do important things.<li> The tone of the school should explicitly and self-consciously stress valuesof unanxious expectation ("I won't threaten you but I expect much of you"), oftrust (until abused) and of decency (the values of fairness, generosity andtolerance). Incentives appropriate to the school's particular students andteachers should be emphasized, and parents should be treated as essentialcollaborators.<li>The principal and teachers should perceive themselves as generalists first(teachers and scholars in general education) and specialists second (experts inbut one particular discipline). Staff should expect multiple obligations(teacher-counselor-manager) and a sense of commitment to the entire school.<li> Ultimate administrative and budget targets should include, in addition tototal student loads per teacher of eighty or fewer pupils, substantial time forcollective planning by teachers, competitive salaries for staff and an ultimateper pupil cost not to exceed that at traditional schools by more than 10percent. To accomplish this, administrative plans may have to show the phasedreduction or elimination of some services now provided students in manytraditional comprehensive secondary schools.</ol><p><hr>                             <h2> Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or comingeditions.

<html><head><title>CES: Publications: Horace: 10-4: Starting a New Essential School</title></head><body><hr><h1><center>Starting a New Essential School:What It Shows About Change</center></h1><hr><center>Volume 10, Number 4    <br>March 1994</center><hr>                                 The sign in front of the school building in a recent NewYorker cartoonreads "THE KNOWLEDGE HUT"-and in small print, beneath,"FORMERLY P.S.102." It could be ribbing any one of the new schoolsspringing up aroundthe nation-whether through New York City's drive to breakdown large,comprehensive high schools into smaller, more personalizedlearningenvironments; through various states' efforts to encouragecharterschool start-ups; or through growing regions' moves toaccommodatepopulation overflow in schools that have new visions as wellas newbuildings.<p>   Or it could intend, even more trenchantly, to skewerschools thatsimply put old wine in new, more sexy bottles-repackaging orevenfranchising the same dreary product to sell as today's funnew publicschooling. Indeed, to avoid this fate by fundamentallyrethinking thewhy and how of schooling has become a crucial and ongoingaim for themany new Essential schools across the country. Both largeand small,these schools are taking advantage of their position to jump-start thechange process- hiring staff who share a common outlook,redesigningtheir curricula and teaching methods, devisinginfrastructures thatsupport new kinds of learning, and giving all concerned moresay in howthe school will run.<p>   But new Essential schools from coast to coast havelearned throughhard experience that starting from scratch provides noexemptions fromthe arduous process of educational change. A new school'sbirth, infact, seems to distill every truism of school restructuringinto anobject lesson in high hopes and hard realities.<p>   "New schools underline the fact that if you don't move ata certainpace, it's hard to move at all," says Deborah Meier, whofounded NewYork City's Central Park East Secondary School in 1986 asone of thecharter members of the Coalition of Essential Schools."We're creaturesof habit. You have to change enough of the circumstancesthat people areforced to make changes in their habits-if you make it easyto fall back,you're soon just teaching the same lesson in a long blockthat we usedto teach in 45 minutes. And you must move while there'senoughenthusiasm that people don't get cynical."<p>   Just how do new schools go about replacing deep-seatedinternalimages of school with new habits and expectations? How dothey createand sustain enthusiasm as the first flush of creation wearsoff? Can anew format alone change what goes on between teachers andstudents inthe classroom? Do some strategies work better than others inintroducingchange to a community? Essential school people involved inlaunch efforts ofevery nature and at every stage spoke to these questions inrecentinterviews, lending new perspective to the struggles thatestablished schoolsencounter as they attempt to change.<p><hr><h2>How New Schools Start</h2><hr>Not all new schools begin with the same circumstances, andtheirvariations may have a lot to do with how far and fast theymove. Oneinnovative reform scheme seeks to take huge comprehensivecity highschools and break them into smaller units that sharebuilding facilitiesbut operate independently in every other way. Meier, forinstance, isnow helping to oversee New York's Coalition Campus Project,which beganin 1993 with the freshman class slated to enter Manhattan's3,000-student Julia Richman High School. That school's decayingphysical plantwill be renovated eventually to house a "campus" ofEssential schoolsserving no more than 400 students each. Six of these smallschools haveopened at various city sites, shaping a more personalizedstructure andcurriculum.<p>   "Change can't be done reasonably in the next generationunless thenumbers are small enough," Deborah Meier declares. "You needno morethan 25 people to be able to sit around and talk about theirideas. In alarge school where the faculty is doing many differentthings, it'sclose to impossible for them to arrive at serious engagementaround theissues of what they want and how to get to it. It becomes abigpolitical negotiations process- politics, not ideas."<p>   But faculties for these urban splinter schools oftenarriveinexperienced or unprepared for the new kinds of schoolingthey will beasked to offer. They may have smaller meetings than in theirformerschools, but they need at least as much support to developnewpractices. "It's been a tremendous struggle," says principalSylviaRabiner of Landmark School, which opened this fall in awindowlessrented space in Harlem while waiting for promised leasedspace, andwhich enrolls 80 ninth-graders who would otherwise have goneto JuliaRichman. "Six of our eight teachers had no first-handfamiliarity withEssential School ideas; several had no teaching experience;and none ofus had ever started a new school before." Nonetheless, Rabinersays, acollegial hiring process led to an extraordinary level ofstaffcommitment, which energized her faculty through the toughestwinter inNew York's memory; not only was Landmark's facultyattendance record 100percent, but its students, known in the past for sky-hightruancy rates,raised their attendance levels to roughly 90 percent.<p>   Meanwhile, New York City schools chief Ramon Cortines hasproposedthe same plan for James Monroe High School in the SouthBronx, callingfor it to splinter into six smaller schools over the nextfour years. Asimilar strategy has begun in Philadelphia in recent years,where thedistrict encourages like-minded teachers to carve outsubsidiaryprograms (which they call "charter schools") from sprawlingcomprehensive high schools.<p>   The idea of granting a "charter"-the right to replace thelocalschool board as an autonomous educational authority-to smallgroups ofteachers, parents, or community members who want to starttheir ownpublic school has gained popularity in recent years. Eightstates haveadopted legislation that permits such ventures, though inwidelydifferent forms. Though some critics argue they siphon fundsand talentfrom other public schools and act as a thin disguise forvoucher-stylechoice systems, charter school advocates say they aim tospark thecreation of innovative new schools and seed large-scalereform. Severalnew charter schools influenced by Essential School ideas-butauthorizedand funded quite differently- are beginning not only inPhiladelphia butin Colorado, Massachusetts, California, and elsewhere. <p>   Finally, many states and districts whose populations areburgeoning-largely in the Southeast, Southwest, and West Coast-havecommissionednew schools simultaneously to accommodate more students andto rethinkwhat and how they should be learning. Georgia's Salem HighSchool, SouthCarolina's Dutch Fork High School, two new high schools inArizona, aSouthern California middle school, and New Hampshire'sSouhegan HighSchool all started with Essential School philosophies. Eachdrew upambitious and idealistic reform plans; but because each isthe mainoffering for area students they have run into many of thesamechallenges from their communities faced by establishedschools the midstof change.<p><hr><h2>What's a 'Real' School?</h2><hr>In an advisory session at Catalina Foothills High School inTucson,Arizona, a dozen ninth- and tenth-graders confront thedifferences theyperceive at the brand new school they inhabit. A dramatic,spaciousstructure overlooking this mountainous desert landscape, itshalls stillecho with fewer students than it will house at capacity in afew years-and its classrooms still echo with past voices of tradition,influencingwhat kids regard as a "real" high school.<p>   "In some ways this place feels more like an elementaryschool, and insome ways it's more like a community college," says onegirl. "You getmore attention, like younger kids-"<p>   "Too much attention!" broke in a boy. "They try to knowyour soul.It's none of their business."<p>   "-but they make you take more responsibility for your ownwork, likein college."<p>   Other kids put in their gripes: too much small-group work("likebabies"), no upperclassmen as yet, the house system ("youdon't feellike you're in high school"), the disruption of havingstarted in alocal middle school. Community controversy over innovationsin schoolschedule and classroom practices resulted in its firstprincipal'sreassignment during the school's first year, and CatalinaFoothills nowruns on a conventional five-period day, offering intensivehonorsclasses on demand. But the uproar left students feelingungrounded-uncertain what to expect from the initial group ofidealistic teacherswho came from all over the country with a firm commitment toEssentialSchool ideas, and whose own expectations met immediateresistance.<p>   At the heart of the dilemma is a fact that plagues everyschoolattempting change, but especially those in more privilegeddistrictsthat consider themselves successful by traditional measureslike collegeadmissions and standardized test scores. "Everyone is aquasi-expert oneducation, because we've all been through it," observes BobMackin, theprincipal of Souhegan High School in Amherst, New Hampshire,which beganat the same time as Catalina Foothills. "For all ofus-students,teachers, parents-what we've experienced gets superimposedover ourideas of what the new school should look like. No matter howcommittedyon are, those outside forces are pulling cat you. There'sso muchinertia in educational institutions."<p>   Souhegan, unlike Catalina Foothills, began with a newbuilding inmove-in condition and a full complement of students ingrades ninethrough twelve. Mackin met with prospective juniors andseniors oftenduring the year before opening to define with them theprimary valuesthat would drive the new school. "Seniors especially drivethe tone andambience of a school," he says. "If you can win them over tothe idea ofa democratic community where they have a real voice, it goesa long wayin creating role models for the culture we believe in." Atransitionteam of fifteen students worked through early issues ofstudentprivileges and disciplinary codes, and wrote the school'sfirst studenthandbook before Souhegan's doors opened.<p>   Still, Mackin sees an advantage to "growing the school"grade bygrade. Prepared in more traditional classrooms, juniors andseniors atSouhegan are less involved than younger students in full-scale EssentialSchool practices, and less accustomed to an integratedcurriculum,heterogeneously grouped classrooms, and performance-basedassessments.This school makes up for the differences by hanging on tomany of thefamiliar trappings of high school: football teams (anundefeated recordin the first year went a long way toward school unity),school colors,traditional grading practices. Such conventions reassure thewholeschool community, many new school people have observed. "Youneed tokeep some familiar things or you'll go crazy," commentsDeborah Meier.<p>   When Salem High School in Conyers, Georgia graduates itsfirst classin 1995, those seniors will have been in their new schoolsince ninthgrade. "In our case community issues bonded us together,"says principalBob Cresswell, who faced a parental uproar over Salem'sinitial policyof de-tracking. Instead of eliminating its heterogeneousapproach, Salembeefed up its offerings by twice-weekly "honors seminars,"paid teachersextra to work with low-achieving students before and afterregularclasses, and invited critical parents into classes toobserve them atany time. "For the last couple of years we have been wellsupported bythe community," Cresswell says. "Every year, though, we haveto changethe schedule as we deal with different things-and that'sfine. We can'tknow all the answers from the start."<p>   Citizens in Sedona, Arizona voted to carve an entire newschooldistrict from the one they had shared with two others acrosscountylines, issuing a bond to build a new high school and expandanelementary school. To help ease the transition for the firstclass ofstudents (now in ninth grade at a large comprehensive highschool in thenext town) superintendent Nancy Alexander and the new highschoolprincipal, Rick Lear, hired their first teacher a full yearbeforeschool opened, and negotiated her year-long placementteaching ninth-grade classes at the neighboring school. The athleticdirector at thenew Sedona Red Rock High School is also a veteran fromSedona, andseveral of the first year's hires come from nearbydistricts.<p><hr><h2>The Uses of Involvement</h2><hr>"Parents and kids both have a lot of anxiety about anythingthat'sdifferent," observes Lear, who for ten years headed aPennsylvaniaalternative school and who studied the progress of newEssential schoolsas a Coalition researcher before he signed on as Sedona'sprincipal."Parents are uncertain about having the kids deal withacademic materialthat they themselves may not know. They're worried aboutwhether kidswill be disadvantaged in college admissions. And parents andkids bothhave a generation of memories-of their own experiences andthose ofolder siblings who may still be in the old school-that gointo theirpicture of high school. It's a major separation they'regoing through,and just as with any loss, we need to provide some kind ofpublicceremonies to go along with it."<p>   Developing a shared language among staff and communityabout schoolchange can go far toward reducing those anxieties, many newschoolleaders point out. The most successful often stay away fromlabels ofany kind even avoiding mention of the Coalition until afterpublicforums have worked through and accepted its principles.Lear, forexample, scheduled a year's worth of planning meetings atall times ofday with parents and students, to hash out questions like,"What willmake us most proud of our graduates?" <p>   No subject is too small or large, it seems, to put on thetable ifstudents and parents are to feel invested in the new schoolearly on.Lear will meet with students next month to pick a schoolmascot andcolors and to work out a student governance system. In hisregularmailing to the community last month he scotched fourcirculating rumors-about school sports, cafeteria heating, metal detectors, andthe band-with the facts on each. "The rumor that the new schoolwouldn't giveletter grades made the round three times," he says wryly,"even thoughfrom the start we agreed that a traditional grading policywas not upfor negotiation."<p>   The most dramatic manifestation of Sedona's inclusiveattitudes camewith the hiring procedures for the 10.5 positions at the newhighschool. After his core staff culled 40 candidates from thel,100inquiries the initial ads brought in, Lear asked fifteenparentvolunteers and twenty students to join committees that wouldinterviewhalf a dozen applicants in person. "For each of theirallottedcandidates, each committee decided only whether they verymuch wantedthis person to teach in our school, or they would becomfortable withthe person teaching here, or they would not want the personhere," hesays. "It took about eighteen hours of their time, but afterwe usedthat input to narrow down our final field, we had a verystrong sense ofwhat the community wanted."<p>   "From day one, parents are going to be almost asinterested as youare in what's happening in the high school," advised YaleUniversityprofessor emeritus Seymour Sarason, the author of<i>The Predictable Failure of Educational Reform</i>, in a recentlunch meetingwith the Sedona school board and superintendent. "When willyou informthem?" Making sure the teaching staff welcomes parents intoclassrooms,he emphasized, should be a school priority; so shouldvisiting eachparent, if possible, before school starts for a conversationabout thestudent's assets, vulnerabilities, and talents.<p>      "Don't patronize them by presenting yourself as havingsolved everyschooling problem from the start," said Sarason, who haswritten a newbook to be titled Parental Involvement and the PoliticalPrinciple. "Anddon't adopt the stance that only you take responsibility forwhathappens in schools. When parents feel trusted and involvedin theschool's decisions- including its disciplinary policies-they'll act aspartners, not adversaries, if trouble comes up later."<p>   Many new schools plan community involvement right intothe schoolday, extending the functions of high school to includeparent education,mentorships, service learning, and apprenticeships. Long-time Coalitionprincipal Judy Cunningham has just begun planning the newSouth LakeMiddle School in Irvine, California, a district with anexplicitcommitment to Essential School principles. "We'd like to bea center forthe adult community as well," she says. "I'm talking withparents aboutworking in important support capacities in the classroom andusing ourtechnology center and fitness facilities after schoolhours." Cunninghamhas visited every elementary school that will feed into thenew school,scheduling meetings with parent leaders and principals totalk overtheir hopes and concerns.<p>   When O'Farrell Community School entered its planning yearin 1990,some five dozen people joined the initial teaching team forregularweekend retreats at which they hammered out key issues. Bythe time theschool opened its doors, it had joined forces with thecounty's socialservices department to provide full family support servicesin a nine-room wing of the school. More than a third of O'Farrell'slargelyminority student population get some kind of attention fromthe agencythere; and it also coordinates the school's extensivecommunity servicerequirement for students.<p>   Regular communication with the community throughnewsletters, localcable television, and newspapers appears critical to a newschool'seffort. Georgia's Salem High School responded to its firstcrisis overheterogeneous grouping by sending home reports to parentsdetailing whatcoursework their child would be doing that week, andinviting them toobserve classes. Central Park East Secondary School's weeklynewslettercontains information, student contributions, and aconversational butthoughtful letter from the principal about what the schoolis aiming forand how.<p>   Finally, meaningful participation by students in theirown democraticgovernance has proved its worth repeatedly in new ventures."We have a45-person governing council-25 students, fifteen staffmembers, and therest community members," says Souhegan's Bob Mackin."Democracy isunwieldy; it took us six to eight months just to get ourproceduresorganized. But this year we're focusing more on policieslike disciplineand attendance, and we expect even more involvement in keyissues likestaffing and budget as time goes by."<p><hr><h2>The Start Is Just a Start</h2><hr>Even when a school is starting from scratch, those who havedone itagree, it's hard to break out of the old patterns withoutcontinualattention to ongoing change. "Like any organization, schoolshave agrowth curve we need to be concerned about," says Salem HighSchool'sBob Cresswell. "People go through an inspiring early phaseof excitementand energy, and then settle in, start managing more, getless involved.If after a certain period you don't try to realign and growagain you'reback in the same old boat as you were before." In Salem'sthird year,Cresswell has asked his faculty to begin a new discussionseries aboutthe Essential School idea that "less is more" and about howto bestexhibit and assess student work. "We can't afford to takethese ideasfor granted," he says. "They'll turn into mere rhetoric andpublicrelations, and then we'll lose our connection with ourmission and theorganization will die."<p>   In its second year of operation Dutch Fork High School,nearColumbia, South Carolina, is pursuing a steady course offacultymeetings and professional development days to discussEssential Schoolprinciples. Parents known as "key communicators" join thediscussionsquarterly to share information and get it out into thecommunity. Andany teachers may take half a day's leave each year to reador talkthrough Coalition materials set aside in the media center."It's notmuch, " says ninth-grade humanities teacher Susan Barron,"but it's thefirst formal recognition that we need time for reading andthat theschool should provide it."<p>   Perhaps the most difficult challenge to new schools isthe heightenedexpectation, among teachers and community both, thateverything willwork as well as the plans have called for. "You can't do itall atonce," warns Deborah Meier. "New schools tend to communicatewithparents in unrealistic ways, and then parents get impatientbecauseyou're not performing as fast as you're talking. Meanwhile,studentsexpect the curriculum will be interesting, the homeworkmeaningful andauthentic, the grades different . . ."<p>   Similarly, parents of high-achieving students will watchtheirstudents' experience like hawks if a new school makesimportantcurricular or pedagogical departures from the status quo,likeinterdisciplinary classes or heterogeneous grouping. Evenwith the bestof intentions, cautions Souhegan's Bob Mackin, a facultymust pay closeattention to the merits of parental concerns in thesecontroversialareas, and continually work toward higher quality in theclassroom.<p>   "Good will and good intentions don't necessarily make forsignificantchange," he says. "Other factors play into realreform-issues ofcompetence, experience, the ability to clearly plan anddevelopcurriculum and put it into practice. Even the most capablepersondoesn't transform overnight from being an exceptionalteacher in the oldconventions to being an extraordinary Essential teacher."Despite thetime it takes, he says, Souhegan has committed itself tocontinualprofessional growth, requiring after-school study groups andbuildingteam planning into its schedule. Year-long teaching internsfrom theUniversity of New Hampshire help make this possible bystepping in tofree teachers for professional development.<p>   Many new schools also learn through hard experience thatthey mustchoose their battles if they want progress to take place."We choseheterogeneous grouping as a hill to die on," says one wearyveteran. "Ifwe had been less rigid about grouping and more innovativeaboutcurriculum, we would have been able to do it." As he readiesSedona RedRock for opening, Rick Lear expresses the same feelingsabout the issueof grades. "It's not worth the fight," he says. "Grades arethe coin ofthe realm when it comes to college admissions. And I don'tbelieve we'llprovoke systemic reform on the basis of individual schoolscoming tounderstandings with individual admissions offices-thatrelies too muchon particular people being there. Better to think insteadabout makinggrades mean something."<p>   Finally, those who start new schools should recognize atthe starthow hard it's going to be, says Deborah Meier. "You have toacknowledgethat tensions between community and staff are notconspiracies, butnaturally difficult questions," she advises. "You have towork it out inpractice, not in policy-it's a phony distinction between thetwo anyway.And if you run into a crisis, it's usually a signal that youhave to movefaster, not slower. Most of the time it indicates you'restuck between twoworlds-maybe your grading policy and your assessment policyare out of syncwith each other. It's just like courtship and marriage, in away- you'vegot to take your foot out of the old world and move it intothe nextone."<p>   The Knowledge Hut, in the end, works better as a jokethan as ametaphor for school transformation-because the changes goingon in newschools, just as in established ones, simply cannot befranchised. Thesenew schools look different from each other in ways asvarious as theircommunities' environments, hopes, and needs. A fresh designand a unitedstaff may give them a jump on their older cousins at thestarting gate,but new schools do not escape the burden of deep-rootedculturalassumptions, or sidestep the toil of making the design intoreality.Like everybody else who aims for school reform, they have tokeepthinking it through. And like every other school attemptingchange, theyneed the support and community of like-minded schools tosustain theirefforts.<p>   In turn, established schools can learn much from thefundamentalsimilarities between the new school experience and theirown. "Every oldschool can be thought of as a new one, or a group of newones,"declares Deborah Meier. "Even if the physical plant andfaculty havebeen there for years, we've got to have the mindset thatwe're startingas a new school. Suppose we were starting from scratch, whatwould wewant for our students? That question can free us to thinkaboutchange in a whole new way." <p>                    <hr><h2>Let's Talk:               How One Community Prepared for Its New School</h2><hr>In the current planning year before Sedona Red Rock HighSchool opens inSedona, Arizona, principal Rick Lear has scheduleddiscussion groups withparents, students, and community members on fourteen topics.Each topicwas scheduled for three alternative times of day, tomaximizeparticipation; and each session ended with the question,"Whatimplications do our views have for the design and operationof our highschool?" The subjects for discussion follow, roughly groupedinto threeareas:<p><h3>Goals, Values, Standards</h3><ul><li>What will make us most proud of our graduates? What willwe expect ofthem?<li>Powerful learning: What is it, and how can we build itinto theschool?<li>Graduation and exhibitions, jobs and future opportunities<li>Standards: How good is good enough?</ul><p><h3>Sample Learning Activities</h3><ul><li>English and social studies Socratic seminars<li>Math and science: Complex problems<li>Integrated curriculum<li>Thinking and Problem-solving</ul><p><h3>Special Topics</h3><ul><li>Using the community: Field-based learning, mentorships,service-learning adult volunteers<li>Parents, teachers, and personalization<li>New technologies: Possibilities and realities<li>Co-curricular activities: Clubs and sports<li>School name, mascot, colors, etc., governance andoperation<li>Curriculum design</ul><p><hr><h2>Outside the System but with the System'sBlessing:               Are Charter Schools a Force for Change?</h2><hr>Eight states have now made charter schools part of theireducationreform agendas, but the dust has not yet settled as toexactly what thatmeans. In California, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts,Michigan,Minnesota, New Mexico, and Wisconsin, legislators haveauthorizedindependent groups of educators, businesspeople, or parentsto createpublicly funded alternatives to their local schools- and arecent surveyindicates that at least fourteen more states are consideringsuchaction.<p>   Though state laws vary widely, in general a charterschool functionsunder contract, outside the system but with its blessing. Inmany cases,such as Colorado and California, groups must apply to theirlocal schoolboards for a charter, with the right to appeal to the stateif turneddown; waivers from regulations must be approved one by one.In others,such as Massachusetts, the state itself grants legalautonomy from thetraditional local educational authority, usually includingexemptionsfrom district collective bargaining agreements. Somedistricts, such asPhiladelphia and New York City, allow sections of publicschools tosplinter into independently managed entities; others preferto chartertotally new schools. Most of California's charter proposalscome fromexisting public schools wishing to convert to charters. Nostateauthorizes public funding of a sectarian school.<p>   Whatever form their ventures take, charter schooladvocates hope toduck an unwieldy educational bureaucracy in the interests ofswiftreform. Some, especially old-school conversions, focus moreon retoolingold management and governance than on changes in content,curriculum, orpedagogy. "We call these 'breakaway schools,"' says RexfordBrown, apolicy analyst at the Education Commission for the Stateswho himselfhas received encouragement from the Denver, Colorado schoolboard for acharter school proposal that reflects many Essential Schoolideas. "Incontrast, the 'breakthrough school' aims to redesign thelearningenvironment from scratch."<p>   In return for independence, however, charter schools mustconfront ontheir own a complex and expensive obstacle course of legalrequirementsfor the health, safety, and civil rights of children-without the safetynet of state and local capital and benefits. "A wholeexoskeleton ofsupports that school people take for granted-buildings thatmeet code,liability insurance, general funds for special education-arenot therefor you," says Brown. "Yet you don't want to create aroundyourself thesame set of strangling regulations that have made theexisting system soregressive." Though some states offer technical assistanceto helpcharters solve such problems, only Massachusetts hasmandated start-upfunds for proposals the state approves.<p>   In virtually all cases, tax dollars follow children whochoose toattend a charter school, though formulas vary as to how muchthatamounts to. For this reason, many critics worry thatcharters will drawoff funds from existing public schools, achieving a voucher-like systemby the back door. Advocates counter that charters cancontribute tosystemic reform by creating a public laboratory in which totry outinnovative ways.<p>   "We have the same type of kids and 80 percent of themoney," saysJohn Mikulas, who last fall enrolled 70 sixth- througheighth-graders inPueblo County, Colorado in the new Connect School, a charterwith anEssential School philosophy. "The district uses the other 20percent toprovide us with transportation and some bookkeepingservices. Twice ayear we report to the central office on our students'progress and ourfinances. In return we get much more control of ourmanagement and ofwhat and how we teach kids." Located in a low-rent buildingin downtownPueblo, Connect School students use public and universitylibraries,science labs at a nearby community college, a districttechnology lab,the local Y for physical education, a city arts center, andan outdoornature study facility at an area middle school. ("All ourteachers alsohave a bus driver's license," Mikulas says wryly.) Studentswith a widerange of special needs learn alongside their classmates,though whentheir needs are too severe, they must go elsewhere in thedistrict."There's a lot you don't know beforehand when you start aschool," saysRex Brown. "If you did, you'd be crazy to do it. Yet you'reconstantlylearning, and it's exhilarating. For the most part, at leasteveryonecoming to you is interested in change."<p><hr>                    <h2>Wanted: All Hands</h2><h3>A New School Asks Its Community to Join the Team</h3><hr>After a series of open discussion groups during its planningyear, Sedona Red Rock High School posted the followingadvertisement to recruit a coordinating committee ofstudents, teachers,parents, and other community members:<p><ul><li>20-25 families of eighth- and ninth-grade students<li>5-10 additional community adults<li>Sedona Red Rock High School staff</ul><p>We're far enough along in our planning that we really needthe help ofthe families of eighth- and ninth-grade students to helpwith ourpreparation for opening Sedona Red Rock High School.

McDonald, Coalition of Essential Schools</center></h3><center>February 1992</center><hr><p><i>The Coalition of Essential Schools gratefully acknowledges the IBM Corporation and the UPS Foundation for their support of its research on Exhibitions.<p>The steps presented in this article are supplemented withsupporting examples from three Essential schools in"Graduation By Exhibition: Assessing Genuine Achievement"by Joseph McDonald, Sidney Smith, Dorothy Turner, Marian Finney & Eileen Barton(Alexandria, VA: Association of Supervision & Curriculum Development 1992).</i><p><hr>	A number of schools within the Coalition of Essential Schools have begun to explore a strategy of schoolkeeping called "planning backwards." It takes aim at the dailiness of schooling -- that necessary churning-on in the life of a school which can easily drift into a numbing habit of self-absorption. In planning backwards, a school pauses from dailiness in order to create a vision of its graduates performing as the school hoped they would. Then the school takes stock of its efforts to fulfill this vision. Finally, it reorients its systems as necessary. From a vision of all its graduates using their minds well, the school plans backwards to these graduates' first days in school assessing the efficacy of structures, curricula, communications, the tempo and tone of school days, methods of teaching and learning, and more -- all by the light of the vision.1 <p>	Viewed backwards, an effort to turn out graduates who use their minds well depends upon good quality systems for goalsetting, standard setting, and accountability. These must be systems that enable fluid and substantive communication, that encourage and support collaboration, that respond quickly and effectively to the intellectual individuality of kids, and that maintain norms of continuous self-scrutiny. Early lessons from schools planning backwards suggest that schools may acquire such systems by taking four steps. In a jumble of metaphors here, I dub these steps defining a vision, building a platform, rewiring, and tuning.2 The first involves planning and deliberation. The second two are bold action steps. The last involves long-term maintenance.  <p><hr><h2>Defining a Vision</h2><hr>	Most high schools today are caught unawares in the rush of certain kinds of stories. One such story uses the old device of two parallel plotlines. In the first, kids study "vocational" subjects and end up in plumbing or hairdressing; in the other, kids study "academic" subjects and end up at Vassar or Penn State. The problem with the story is that it reflects our bad habit of dividing the technical from the intellectual, the practical from the theoretical. Life mixes up these things and schools should too. The fact is all kids in high school need more access to serious intellectual activity, and all need more firsthand experience with work as it is done beyond the secondary labor market of malls and fast-food franchises. Kids shouldn't have to choose between these opportunities. <p>	There are also the "scope and sequence" stories. One of the most powerfully entrenched of these concerns a multi-year voyage toward calculus. Students of mathematics at nearly every juncture of the voyage ask their teachers, "Why do we have to do this stuff?" The teachers respond, "So you can continue on to the destination." Yet only a minuscule proportion of kids ever reaches the destination, and many still continue to wonder what the journey was about. After perhaps a year of college, they drop the study of mathematics forever.<p>	To escape the grip of such stories, schools planning backwards have tried setting aside temporarily what is broadly called curriculum and instead simply imagine the school's candidates for graduation using their minds well. In its mind's eye, the school struggles to acquire a vision of integrated intellectual performance, unfogged by Regents exams, state curriculum requirements, Carnegie units, and SAT formats. Perhaps, in this vision, candidates for graduation are able to deal well with questions posed by expert strangers on matters they have spent months studying independently. Or perhaps they can discuss several tough texts in a graduation seminar, then write about the texts with skill, conviction, and insight. Perhaps they do this in two languages. Perhaps they show the sculpture they've created, the boat they've built, the technology they've contrived to solve a problem set before them -- or, even better, one they've set themselves. Whatever the particularities of the vision, the kids who animate it handle themselves in ways that make their teachers proud -- the math teacher who detects the application of quantitative reasoning, the history teacher who hears evidence of historical imagination, the art teacher who glimpses the underlying aesthetic sense, the advisor who knows exactly how far this kid has come.<p>	These activities are what the Coalition of Essential Schools calls exhibitions. They originate as articulations of a school's vision -- movies for a mind's eye, portraying graduates using their minds well. These exhibitions, as orientations for a school's work, are an enormous improvement on "mission statements" and "visioning slogans" because they offer concrete images of real kids, because they have the power to stimulate teaching in ways that statements and slogans do not, and because they also function as assessment tools.3 <p>	Having imagined such exhibitions, the school then struggles to make them actual, by planning backwards. The struggle encompasses all the school's plans, all the way back to the student's first day in high school. What habits must teachers seek to instill, what practice must students have so that they can perform as well as in the vision? What assessment mechanisms along the way may provoke as well as record growth? In the most productive circumstances, such deliberations proceed against the backdrop of a new image for curriculum. What if curriculum were no longer a set of "streams" which kids enter so that they may be carried along to diverse destinations? What if it were instead a great scaffold, whose rigging all kids must climb to a significantly high point, though each in his or her own fashion and time?4<p>	One way that schools ensure a whole vision, uncontaminated by what I call above the old gripping stories, is to invite all their stakeholders to participate in its fashioning. These include teachers, parents, and students, of course, but also some others whose greater remoteness from the dailiness of the school enriches as well as limits their counsel: business interests, scholars, partisans of local culture, champions of moral and political aims for schools.5<p><hr><h2>Building a Platform</h2><hr>	The purpose of a school's vision is to orient the school's first moves, then to guide all subsequent ones. Yet, except in the cases of new schools whose first cohorts are still years from graduation, schools planning backwards must also dare to compare their new visions of the ideal graduate to the real kids they will graduate this year. In the metaphorical lingo of planning backwards, this is called building a platform. On the school's platform -- erected at first atop the same old curriculum, the same isolated teaching cells, the same hierarchical information systems -- current candidates for graduation are asked to exhibit by the light of the vision. Initial platforms tend to focus on some essential intellectual skill: writing a paper, reading and discussing a tough text, framing a problem, and so on -- one that obviously inheres in the school's vision, one that the whole faculty agrees is so fundamental that all graduates should possess it. Building a platform means daring to inquire whether students about to graduate do possess it.  <p>	So a platform is, first of all, an assessment device -- one that stands apart from senior course work, apart from the warm relations of students and teachers who have come to know each other well after years of working together. The platform design may involve public recitals, may resemble the presentation and defense of a doctoral thesis, may fill the gym with displays and artifacts (as in an art exhibit or a science fair), may command an expertly scored performance (as in an Olympic trial or the road test for a driver's license).<p>	In the schools that have built them, these platforms are often partly ceremonial -- the intellectual equivalent of the senior prom. But the best of them are also rigorous: they "count" in the sense that seniors must pass them, and in the sense that teachers and soon to be seniors take great interest in the platform's processes and products. This interest proves generative intellectually and helps the school build an intellectual identity. Its kids may come to acknowledge proudly that their school puts intellectual demands on them, that it is more than the sum of its athletics and social life.<p>	Just as significantly, the platform functions also as an instrument of institutional evaluation. Set apart as it is from the rush of school life, it provides a kind of observation deck upon which the faculty can stand to view its collective efforts -- to see the school's systems at work. This is a rare opportunity in schoolkeeping, yet it seems fundamental to the exercise of professional responsibility and reflective practice.6<p><hr><h2>Rewiring</h2><hr>	What does the faculty espy from its platform? As I suggested above, it espies at first the same old curriculum, the same isolated teaching, the same hierarchical information systems -- but now by fresh light. In this light, questions emerge which could not emerge before. How do our ninth-graders' experiences in speaking and writing jibe with the demands of the twelfth-grade platform? What other platforms do we need to erect along the way to graduation? How can we keep better track of kids' progress? How can we show them what they are progressing toward? Now that we've watched our work collectively, how can we make the work itself more collective?<p>	I do not mean, of course, that these questions emerge spontaneously, nor that a school's answers to them arise readily and without dispute. The early lesson from schools planning backwards is simply that they do emerge. And that is really something, since such questions are as rare in school as clean chalk trays.<p>	Furthermore, an early lesson from the schools is that these questions lead to major overhauls of the school's systems. Those of us studying the phenomenon call this rewiring. We choose this metaphor in place of the common term restructuring in order to suggest that schooling is composed of networks for the exchange of energy and information, but networks that are typically inadequate to the load they should bear.<p>	To understand the problem, one might well consider the point of view of a parent who wishes to know how her fourteen-year-old daughter is progressing in school. First, the parent is forced by the design of the school's wiring to qualify her question. Does she wish the answer in terms of expectations for the collegebound? By reference to the weighted grade-point average of the other kids in her class? By reference to the norms of the California Achievement Test? Or is she interested in affective measures of progress?<p>	Yes, responds the parent to this last question, hoping for a more personal and integrated account. Well, comes the answer down the wires, make the rounds of your daughter's eight teachers on parent's night. Start each four minute conference with the question, "How's Gayle doing?" Then listen as the teachers of math, history, Spanish, and so on quote from their grade books and recount anecdotes from experience. Put all the information together yourself, knowing that nobody in the school routinely integrates this information, that even Gayle only rarely has access to it in any comprehensive form (which is the main reason, by the way, apart from any fear that she may not own up to the truth, why you cannot simply ask Gayle herself how she's doing). Meanwhile, ask her guidance counselor, for whom Gayle is likely to be largely a statistical profile, how she should be doing, and you'll get norms or threats of them: "We'll know more next year after she has taken the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test."<p>	This account of a high school's wiring from the point of view of an inquiring parent is not an indictment of teachers nor of guidance counselors. It is an indictment of a system of information exchange where the wires run mostly parallel, where professional collaboration in an effort to provoke and assess the intellectual development of a single student is consequently quite rare, where nobody -- including teachers and kids themselves -- has the resources needed to hold in mind a detailed and integrated vision of where his or her work aims or ought to aim.<p>	How does a school rewire? Quite early lessons suggest that a few quick steps are useful: the invention of new junctures at which, for example, teachers come together to exchange graded papers and discuss grading standards, or at which parents and teachers and members of the larger community come together to share perspectives on achievement, or at which classes combine across grades and levels to discuss the same texts or problems or to get involved in the same activity. But such efforts -- even regularly undertaken -- are not enough by themselves. More painful efforts must follow. For example, the school must dare to confront habits of isolated teaching and assessment and must force collaboration in the interests of kids. It must dredge its standards up out of secrecy and provide kids and parents with exemplars to consult. It must give teachers the time and the resources they need to communicate with each other and with parents. It must end batchprocessing of kids in tracks and must invent ways instead to honor the fact that kids differ as much within batches as across them. This will entail alternatives to the nearly exclusive reliance today on curriculum driven large group instruction, alternatives such as the addition to the curriculum of project work undertaken individually and in ensembles, the provision of studio and workshop time and space, the opportunity to enter intellectually oriented apprenticeships, and the cultivation of learning resources both within the community that is the school and also within the community outside the school.<p>	This is, of course, a very demanding agenda. Few schools within the Coalition have yet taken up much of it. Early lessons from the pioneers, however, suggest that a useful strategy is to extend, embellish, and diversify the original platform. So, for example, one school in the Coalition began with a simple platform: in addition to completing all course requirements, all seniors must write a persuasive essay to a particular standard of performance in order to graduate. Since then, the school has extended this platform to include other writing-performance demands at other points in time, as well as a final math assessment. Soon it hopes to institute portfolio-based assessment in writing also, and a schoolwide project-based assessment in science. These may seem small steps given the scope of the agenda above, yet each entails new opportunities for communication among the faculty, new reporting and transcription systems, new mechanisms for standard-setting and keeping, new windows on the school's operations -- indeed, new commitments to assuring a quality education to kids who have never before enjoyed such assurance. These are all innovations in wiring, and their consequence is wiring better suited for the long haul of changes to come. <p><hr><h2>Tuning</h2><hr>	At the Coalition of Essential Schools, we claim that if schools can get the wiring right -- including plenty of junction boxes inside the school and plenty of lines running to the outside -- then this wiring will serve well for quite some time. The exchange of information along the wiring, however, like telephone usage, is apt to shift continuously over time in terms of function, volume, and parties participating. <p>	Some of this exchange of information involves what we call tuning. This is the process by which a school attends responsibly to its outside stakeholders. These include parents, of course, but a school has other stakeholders, too. One might argue that every citizen in the world has a stake in every single American school's outcomes -- whether, for example, its graduates have the skills and the ethics to participate responsibly in a global ecology, economy, and culture. In any case, every American community certainly has a substantial cultural and economic stake in its schools' work. And every American business has a stake in the quality of the schools its future employees attend. Finally, every American scholar and scholarly agency has a stake in how schools treat scholarship.<p>	Tuning involves inquiry and response. What does the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics currently suggest should be the emphases of the mathematics curriculum? The school listens, then tunes to the newer frequency. What has been the experience of the class of 1990 in its first years of college or work? The school looks, then adjusts the preparation of the class of 1992. Which five human skills does the local business community most prize in a new worker?7 Which five human attitudes does the local cultural community most prize in a new adult? What might local professors of composition have to say about a sample of a school's senior essays? These are all tuning questions: teachers invite good people to answer them, then mull the answers over.<p>	But how can schools possibly manage to tune themselves in this way, given all the other demands on their time and resources? One way is to exchange custody as well as information. The faculty at Central Park East Secondary School, a New York City public high school, gains time and tuning opportunity by sending its students off each week for a morning or afternoon of community based learning through community service.8  Another way is to integrate distance learning into the curriculum. Thayer High School, in rural New Hampshire, plans to connect its teachers and kids to remote others via electronic mail and video integrated into regular instruction.9 A third way is to cultivate a network of local critical friends. This is the strategy explicitly employed by the schools associated with New York's Center for Collaborative Education and, at least implicitly, by other innovative regional networks -- for example, the Philadelphia Schools Collaborative, the Southern Maine Partnership, the Illinois Alliance of Essential Schools, the Jefferson CountyÐGheens Academy partnership, and the League of Professional Schools in Georgia. In effect, these communities of schools follow the lead of successful communities of teachers like the National Writing Project affiliates, the Foxfire networks, and the regional chapters of Educators for Social Responsibility. The former organizations do for schools what the latter do for individual teachers.<p><hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><hr>	In introducing the four dimensions of planning backwards described above, I have called them steps. The metaphor works insofar as these four may best be taken up in the order in which I have described them. In this order, the metaphor also signifies that the four proceed from least to most difficult: defining a vision is at least one level of difficulty easier than building a platform, which is in turn much easier than rewiring. As I have suggested, only the most daring schools in the Coalition have seriously begun to rewire. Tuning is hardest of all, because American schools are deeply isolated from other worlds, including the one just outside their doors. Whenever I walk or ride past a high school building in the middle of a schoolday morning, I am astonished again at the contrast between its placid exterior demeanor and what I know to be the teeming life contained inside.<p>	The steps metaphor breaks down, however, when one considers how -- unlike steps -- the four dimensions of planning backwards overlap and even circle back upon themselves. A school would be foolish, for example, to insist on establishing a complete and coherent vision before it dared to build a platform. In platform-building especially, the early lesson from the schools is that impetuousness is a virtue -- to do this work, one must quickly find a place to stand in order to observe. Another lesson is that platform building entails rewiring, so that schools timorously approaching this step may find pleasantly that they have already taken it. Finally, any school interested in planning backwards, one that seeks participation in the conversation about change that we call the Coalition of Essential Schools, has already taken a step out of isolation and so may be said to have begun to tune up.<p><hr><h2>Footnotes</h2><hr><ol><li> For a comprehensive description of planning backwards, see Joseph P.

<html><head><title>CES: Publications: Research Papers: The Process of Planning Backwards</title></head><body><h1><center>The Process of Planning Backwards:Stories from Three Schools</center></h1><hr><h3><center>by Jody Brown Podl, Coalition Of Essential Schools<p>And Faculty fromHodgson Vocational-Technical High School, Newark, DE<br>The Watkinson School, Hartford, CT<br>Thayer Junior-Senior High School, Winchester, NH<p></center></h3><center>May, 1992</center><hr><p><i>The Coalition of Essential Schools gratefully acknowledges the IBM Corporation and the UPS Foundation for their support of its research on Exhibitions.</i><p><hr>        One outgrowth of the nine Common Principles that underpin thework of the Coalition of Essential Schools1 is the notion of planningbackwards. It is a means by which a school can focus on the end of astudent's secondary education and let that endpoint cast its shadowback on every facet of the school. The first step in thisshadowcasting often leads schools to translate the lofty intentions oftheir vision statements into concrete ways for students to show theirintellectual and personal growth.<p>        The role of exhibitions is very important in the process ofplanning backwards. The exhibition has been described as the academiccounterpart of a musical recital or an athletic event (Sizer, 1984).2The fruit of both hard work and intense interest, these exhibitions --varying in format according to the individual teachers and studentsinvolved -- ask students to do authentic, demanding work that has somekind of personal significance.<p>        In theory, reframing assignments in this fashion may fuelenormous schoolwide change. Students become more invested in theirstudies; teachers function more as advisors and coaches than disseminators of information; subject matter is connected to students' livesand its interdisciplinary nature is tapped; schedules become moreflexible in order to allow for sustained inquiry and coaching.<p>        Implicit in this agenda is the idea that exhibitions are notsolely a means of assessment. They do double duty. They are a means ofassessment, and also an integral part of teaching and learning.<p>        Exhibitions challenge attendance and Carnegie units as thedeterminers of graduation from high school. Students exhibit -- or showin public -- what they know and are able to do, thereby earning theright to graduate.3 To this end, Wiggins (1991) asserts that educatorsshould set standards that exemplify that "work is not done until it isdone right." Schools must also make public, and hold students to,these clear standards for quality work. Most importantly, they mustorient their structures, curricula, and support systems so that alltheir kids get there.<p>        Given the radical components of planning backwards, then, itshould come as no surprise that, early on, schools in the Coalitionwere not only hesitant but also unprepared to commit themselves tosuch a strategy. Instead, Essential schools elected to focus theirefforts on classroom changes first,4 perceiving that these reformswould be easier to implement and would provide momentum for systemicchanges at a later date (Muncey and McQuillan, 1991).<p>        Interestingly, this approach expanded the original idea ofexhibitions (Powell, 1986). Since few schools were ready or able toreplace their "traditional" graduation requirements with seniorexhibitions, individual teachers instead created "mini" or "course-level" exhibitions for their classes. Conceived as precursors to afinal exhibition that would be developed later, these types ofexhibitions made sense insofar as they provided students withauthentic ways to practice for the grand finale. However, manyschools, daunted by the magnitude of the task, proved unable toinstitute a culminating, exit level exhibition.<p>        The experiences of the early schools that experimented withexhibitions show that changes that occur in individual classrooms donot necessarily lead to changes in the whole school. Hence, thestrategy of planning backwards has played an increasingly large rolein efforts to promote effective schoolwide change. Recent developmentsin the field, such as the debate about whether schools should be heldto national standards and the growing support for alternativeassessment, also serve to underscore the potential for using theprocess of planning backwards. Bolstered by the successes of a fewschools that have dared to -- and have succeeded at -- planningbackwards,5 this strategy is gaining momentum.<p>        The following accounts describe how the process of planningbackwards has unfolded at three schools in the Coalition: HodgsonVocational-Technical High School in Newark, Delaware; Watkinson Schoolin Hartford, Connecticut; and Thayer Junior-Senior High School inWinchester, New Hampshire. The narratives explore how these schoolsoriented their systems toward a shared vision of the skills,knowledge, and values that all graduates should possess and, then, howthey found ways for their students to conform to this vision. Toachieve its vision, each school made changes -- often significant ones-- in assessment practices, curriculum, and pedagogy. Each school'sunique story reveals the intricate navigation that planning backwardsdemands.<p><hr><h2><center>Senior Project: An Exhibition of Achievement</center></h2><h2>Paul M. Hodgson Vocational-Technical High School<br>Newark, Delaware</h2><b>Steven H. Godowsky, Principal<br>Maryan Scarbrough, Chair, English Department<br>Carolyn Steinwedel, English/Special Education Teacher</b><p><hr>        Hodgson Vo-Tech serves over 900 students from throughout NewCastle County, Delaware. A member of the Coalition of EssentialSchools through the Delaware Re:Learning initiative since 1991,6Hodgson offers students twenty-two career programs in conjunction witha comprehensive academic course of study. In order to facilitateintegrated study, the faculty has formed inter-disciplinary teams. Theschool's reform efforts have been supported by both the New CastleCounty Vocational-Technical School District and the state of Delaware.<p>        The faculty at Paul M. Hodgson Vocational-Technical High Schoolis committed to having its students demonstrate their skills andknowledge in meaningful ways. Our schoolwide priority is to integratethe vocational and academic disciplines. As a result of our immersionin the nine Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools,we developed the Senior Project: An Exhibition of Achievement. TheSenior Project is a process that combines student centered research,the development of a career related product and a final, publicdemonstration. Through this integrated process, we intend to improvesignificantly student achievement and to help all of our students usetheir minds well.<p>        The creation of this project did not happen overnight, nor wasit the brain child of a single individual. Instead, it was andcontinues to be a consolidated effort on the part of many of theHodgson faculty.<p>        When we first began our involvement with the Coalition ofEssential Schools, we held many conversations among the faculty todiscuss how we could go about implementing these ideas. Our vocationalprograms are all competency based; students work on sets ofindividualized tasks, moving on to the next one upon completion of thefirst. For instance, as a first assignment a student in ElectricalTrades may wire a circuit so that it has on and off switches thatwork. Once she accomplishes this task, she moves on to a moredifficult project that incorporates the skills and knowledge that shehas acquired by succeeding with the first task. Thus, in many ways,our curriculum design made us familiar with performance basedassessment. For this reason, it made sense for our school as a wholeto start with the principle of Diploma by Exhibition.<p>        There existed already in the academic curriculum a senior shop-based research paper which integrated the English and vocationalareas. All seniors wrote term papers about one self selected aspect ofhis or her vocational field. A cabinet-making student, for example,might choose to research a certain type of furniture making. At thispoint, we formed a committee to investigate the possibility ofexpanding on this paper to create a multi-component senior projectwhich would require students to demonstrate skills mastered in careerand academic programs. As part of their work, the committee contactedother Coalition schools and requested information about how theyapproached exhibitions. Our inquiry convinced us that we had thefoundation of an important idea and the expertise to make it workwithin our own faculty.<p>        That summer, a four-teacher team attended the Curriculum andInstruction Institute in St. Louis, Missouri, where they endeavored towrite the first draft of the Senior Project. They created a three-partplan that would consist of a shop-based research paper taught in theEnglish classroom, the design and creation of a related product, and apublic, formal oral presentation, all of which would be completedduring the student's senior year. The idea was that the investigationof furniture making might narrow down to an in-depth look at thePennsylvania Dutch furniture makers and a reproduction of a cornerhutch that is representative of the group's craftsmanship. Then, in aten to thirty minute presentation before his teacher advisors,parents, and specialists from the community, the student would displayhis hutch and provide information, putting the piece of furniture inhistorical as well as artistic context. After fielding questions fromthe panel, the student would then sit with the committee to getimmediate feedback about the exhibition.<p>        We started the following school year with inservice days thatallowed the full faculty the opportunity to react to the plan that washammered out in St. Louis. If we were to succeed in this venture, itwas important to get as much faculty support as possible.  To do so,people had to understand the plan. The Senior Project EvaluationCommittee (SPEC), an eight-member group, held several meetings,initiated individual conversations, and invited reactions and scrutinyfrom the rest of the faculty. In many ways, the members of thiscommittee played the role of salesmen, pitching their product to theneighborhood.<p>        Once we felt that we had generated enough support for the basicidea of the exhibition, the SPEC moved on to the next step: devisingthe overall structure and working through the logistic procedures. Thegroup established a set of project guidelines and then published aSenior Project Manual that explained the exhibition to the students.<p>        Then, we faced an important question. Should we continue to workon the planning and try to deal with possible problems before theyoccurred or should we instead put the plan into action and deal withthe problems as they surfaced? Two factors influenced our decision togo ahead with Senior Project. First of all, we had a very small seniorclass due to state initiatives three years before that had prohibitedus from accepting ninth grade students. With only ninety twelfth-graders, we had a one-time chance to pilot the plan on a small scalewhile still including every student. More importantly, however, wasthe faculty support for the concept. Thus, we initiated our exhibitionof vocational and academic mastery that year.<p>        Regardless of the fact that we had prepared long and hard forSenior Project, we recognized that any number of unanticipated issuesmight arise during that first year. Therefore, the SPEC continued tomeet throughout the yearlong process to deal with any problems, toschedule presentations, and to keep the faculty informed each step ofthe way. The results of the year's "experiment" were exciting, and anumber of benefits accompanied the exhibition's inception.<p>        First, and most importantly, were the gains made by ourstudents. We were able to document increased student time spent onhome and classwork. Written and oral communication skills improved,and students demonstrated new proficiency in conducting research. Theybecame more able to think critically and to react intelligently toquestions. They responded to a major challenge during their senioryear -- a time more often spent "coasting out" -- and responded wellbeyond our initial expectations. After a year of hard work, thesestudents were proud of their accomplishments and felt confident thatthey really knew what they were talking about.<p>        An unanticipated but powerful benefit accrued to the faculty,too. The individual project evaluation committees brought togetherstaff from all disciplines to lend advice and support to the students.Working as teams, sharing new information, and dealing with theiradvisees gave the faculty greater insight into and appreciation foreach other's disciplines. Bringing the faculty together ended up beingour most important step toward reaching the goal of meaningfullyintegrating the academic and vocational curriculum.<p>        While the initiation of Senior Project resulted in much success,it also had its share of bugs, like any first effort. We often had torevise or clarify information as we went along. For instance, thetimelines that we set for the work turned out to be unrealistic, andwe also realized early on that we needed to include more checkpoints --for the sake of both the students and the faculty -- along the way.Also, in order to manage the proceedings, we decided to publish liststhat spelled out each student's topic and advisors.<p>        In addition, we discovered that communications among the facultyregarding both the purpose and procedures needed consistentreinforcement. Since this exhibition asked faculty from differentdepartments to work closely together, additional cooperation wasnecessary. Sometimes, this collaboration proved stressful, especiallysince the procedures were not always clearly delineated. For example,each student selected advisors that ultimately served as theevaluation committee for this individual's project. Since theseadvisors were self-selected by the students, every group wasdifferent. Each committee interpreted its role in its own way; someworked very closely with the student while others took more passiveroles. This inconsistency caused a certain degree of confusion.<p>        At the end of the school year, SPEC surveyed the faculty and thestudents about the whole experience. Using the information gathered inthese questionnaires, SPEC reworked the process and the manual so thatthey would reflect what we had learned.<p>        To facilitate Senior Project, the twelfth-grade Englishcurriculum was revamped to include a semester-long technical writingcomponent in which the career related research paper would be taught.We also had to make adjustments for students in the cooperativeeducation program who, as a result of workstudy schedules where theyworked for two weeks and then attended class for two weeks, they spentonly half the usual number of hours in academic classes. Now, thesestudents would have a double period of English so that they couldcomplete their research in a more satisfactory manner. Finally, in aneffort to further integrate the project, vocational instructors wereasked to lend their expertise and involve themselves in the grading ofthe rough and final drafts of the paper as well as in the formationand construction of the shop product.<p>        Using this first year to determine student strengths andweaknesses encouraged us to rethink our entire curriculum. Reviewingvideotapes of the exhibitions and the faculty evaluations, forexample, made us aware that our students had trouble with bringingtheir presentations to a close. Therefore, the faculty brainstormedways in which to teach this skill. Our faculty had anticipated thatfor the students, writing the research paper would be the mostdifficult part of the process; however, the students overwhelminglyresponded that they feared the oral presentation most. Therefore, wewanted to find ways to make students feel more comfortable with andconfident about this component.<p>        If all seniors at Hodgson must do this exhibition, we thought,then it makes sense to prepare underclassmen for the demands oflongterm research, related shop construction, and publicdemonstration. To this end, starting in ninth grade, we began to askstudents to perform tasks -- individually and in groups -- that requirethe same skills they will have to employ as seniors. As a result ofthis practice, we anticipate that by the time these students areseniors, they will be well prepared for the rigors of Senior Project.<p>        We also had to think about how to implement Senior Project witha much larger group of seniors. To accommodate this increase, we splitthe senior class in half, with one half doing their Senior Project bythe end of the first semester and the other half by June. In addition,in an effort to draw in more teachers and to lessen the burden on theEnglish and vocational instructors, we encouraged the seniors toinvolve other faculty and staff as members of their evaluationcommittees and as sources for their research.<p>        Next, we made a decision that all of our students wouldparticipate in Senior Project. Our special needs students, groupedinto a self-contained senior English class but mainstreamed in allvocational areas, follow the same guidelines for the Project as theother seniors, though they work on their exhibitions for the entireyear instead of a single semester. Finally, we held several meetingswith the faculty to discuss and define what it means to be an advisorfor Senior Project. Seeking consistency, we attempted to outline waysin which to help students to prepare for their exhibitions.<p>        Looking to the future, our job is now to continue addressing theissues that have surfaced as a result of student and faculty surveys,SPEC meetings, informal as well as structured conversations, andinservice discussions. Some of these concerns are logistical ones: howto schedule presentations, how to account for the fact that some kidshave a full year to prepare and some have only a half, how to findrelease time for committee members, how to obtain materials forconstructing products and for doing reserach. More complex concernshave also come up: Are we really moving toward Diploma by Exhibition?How can we create consistency in the grading of the three-partprocess? How can we help our students challenge themselves more and atthe same time be less fearful of the performance component? How can wemaintain and improve communication among the faculty as well as amongSPEC members?<p>        We are dealing with these questions and concerns in a variety ofways. We have held special lunchtime and afterschool conversationsaimed at helping advisors, especially new ones, to cope with theexperience. We have expanded the SPEC to include a wider range offaculty and support staff so that more views are represented. We haveformed subcommittees to work on improving the student and facultysurveys and the other paper work that accompanies this project. We areusing videotapes of previous presentations to enlighten teachers andto assist students in the process. We are even planning a special"Junior" day during which all eleventh-grade students will be involvedin group sessions to discuss the goals, expectations, and preparationthat Senior Project requires.<p>        We have learned a lot from our early experiences in planning andorchestrating exhibitions for our seniors. We now recognize moreclearly the many issues to be dealt with when a schoolwide project isimplemented that requires new and different ways to measure whatstudents know and can do. As a faculty, we feel well prepared torealize our goals. More importantly, our students have learned a greatdeal as a result of Senior Project: An Exhibition of Achievement.<p><hr><h2><center>The Process of Change</center></h2><h2>Watkinson School<br>Hartford, Connecticut</h2><b>Marianne Devine, Director of Studies, Upper-Team Head<br>Cathy Katz, Publications Director<br>Susan Lukas, Chair, English Department</b><p><hr>        Watkinson is a private day school that enrolls 180 students(grades 6 through 12 plus an optional pre-college year) in a college-preparatory program. Having explored the Coalition since 1987,Watkinson became a member in 1990. The Watkinson community has doneextensive work in redefining the roles that students and teachers playin the classroom. The school has also forged a very productive workingrelationship with the University of Hartford. As a private school,Watkinson has not had to worry about building state and districtsupport for planning backwards, but has had to work closely withcollege admissions offices and consult carefully with Watkinsonparents and alumni.<p>        In 1985 Watkinson began a long-range planning process thatasked, "Who are we?" Our faculty was complaining about student apathyand there was widespread interest in making students more responsiblefor and more involved in their academic work. In 1987, as an outgrowthof this process, we started exploring the Coalition of EssentialSchools.<p>        Watkinson's decision to apply for membership in the Coalitionand our teachers' earliest attempts to implement Coalition ideas intheir classrooms grew out of frequent meetings of the entire facultyas well as of small departmental groups or grade-level teams. In thesemeetings, we first assessed our values as a faculty. We brainstormedwhat skills and knowledge we wanted students to have when theygraduate from Watkinson. At the same time, we felt it was important tomove slowly, to get it right. The process was, for the most part, slowand reflective; teachers had the chance to think things through and totry things for themselves.<p>        In order to make significant changes, the faculty determinedthat above all it needed planning time. The administration fullysupported this request. Teachers from all departments and all gradelevels attended Coalition workshops, visited other Coalition schools,and brainstormed with colleagues. By restructuring faculty meetings,inservice days, and professional development priorities, facultymeeting time was reallocated as time for department and team meetings,and an annual two-day faculty retreat was established for training andplanning. Sometimes we had to think of more creative ways to get timeto work. For example, on "Student-as-teacher" Day, students preparedand taught class while parents functioned as non participatingobservers. This day proved successful for many reasons. First, wefreed faculty for a full day exchange of Coalition ideas with aneighboring university. Second, students did not miss school. Third,the students enjoyed "taking over" and did good work.<p>        In addition, the administration granted stipends for faculty tomeet over dinner as a way to encourage interdisciplinary planning.  ACoalition consultant was engaged for regular visits over two years; aspart of this consultation, we met as a faculty or in small groups tobrainstorm ways in which to engage our students in the learningprocess.<p>        This work engendered several changes. The school divided intothree teams (Middle School: grades 6-8; Intermediate: grades 9-10;Upper: grades 11-13) in order to address developmental issues and togive the faculty an opportunity to work together in small groups oncurriculum and planning. This change of structure supported changeswithin the departments and in the classes. Departments worked togetherto frame units and courses.<p>        The emphasis in the classroom changed from the traditionallecture style and format. Students were asked to work in cooperativegroups to develop questions and answers, to take responsibility forteaching other students, and to demonstrate mastery through oralpresentations, using a variety of media. Now, for instance, in seniorEnglish classes, students choose an author to study at the start ofthe year. At the end of the first trimester, they give a presentationthat focuses on this writer's background and a few of his or herworks. At the end of the second trimester, they share more informationabout the author's writing and might even draw in other material. Atthe end of the final trimester, all students have become "experts" ontheir authors and they stand for questioning and conversation withother "experts." In biology and chemistry, students teach wholechapters to the class, and their grades are based on the otherstudents' ability to pass tests that cover the material from thesepresentations. In geometry, cooperative group learning has replacedthe traditional classroom altogether. All students work in permanentgroups of three; they solve problems together, they review materialtogether, and they take tests together.  The teacher still sets tasksand directs the course, but the students have learned to rely on eachother. These bursts of change made by a handful of teachers haveinspired others.<p>        Perhaps most importantly, the time that our faculty spentworking together to make sense of the ideas and ramifications of thenine Common Principles enabled us to get to know each other well.Thus, we are supportive of each other's efforts to make changes, andwe are comfortable asking hard, probing questions in our efforts tofurther the work of our school. As we realized the value of this kindof reflection, we sought to instill the same habit in our students.<p>        As a result, in several courses, self-evaluations have replacedor been added to the traditional teacher evaluation at comment time:students reflect on their progress and the work they have accomplishedin their classes as well as on the process by which they have achievedprogress. Also, students routinely evaluate other students as theypresent class projects. Self-evaluation requires analysis based onaudio- or videotapes of the presentation (if oral) and asks studentsto look even more closely at the value, synthesis and delivery of thepresentation or paper. Peer evaluation requires students to reportobjectively about what they have seen and heard, to determine the mosteffective aspects of the work, to investigate what was leftincomplete, and to evaluate the project according to the specificcriteria determined by the teacher at the outset of the project. Weconstantly evaluate our curriculum based on the observations thatstudents make about their own work.<p>        With these modifications in place, we moved on to considerexhibitions, a task that at first appeared insurmountable in terms ofboth logistics and implementation. A major source of frustrationexperienced by our teachers was the realization that the Coalition didnot offer many prescribed programs, that there were no clear models tofollow, to imitate or to adapt. However, after these formative yearswe realize that a prescribed program would be antithetical to theCoalition philosophy, and that it made sense to use our own school formodels.<p>        For developing mastery demonstrations, our teacher-pioneersfound two excellent models within our own school community. First, theWatkinson Creative Arts Diploma Program prescribes exacting criteriafor students to develop what is essentially a mastery demonstration.In this program, students participate actively in some artisticendeavor, be it ballet, violin, or poetry writing. In addition tomeeting as a class once a week and having individual conferences withtheir advisors once a week, these students write research papers abouttheir field, work as apprentices to local artisans, and attend aseries of guest lectures arranged by their advisor. Furthermore, allparticpants are required to perform several times a year duringschool-sponsored "noon concerts." Second, seniors in advanced finearts classes are required to mount a graduation art exhibit on theirown, taking responsibility not only for creating and displaying theirart, but also for designing the format of the exhibit, creating andsending invitations, and providing food and entertainment for theevent.<p>        With these examples in mind, we convened a workshop in October1991, during which our faculty and several members from otherEssential Schools and the University of Hartford worked for two daysto develop model mastery demonstrations. Having worked to assimilatethe nine Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools forover four years, the Watkinson faculty was finally ready to begin toexplore exhibitions.<p>        In preparation, a special faculty committee designed the processwe used for the workshop. On Day One, we worked within our departmentsto develop one unifying thematic question for each subject, one thatcould serve as the focal point for a mastery demonstration for onestudent in that discipline. Framing these thematic questions madeteachers narrow down what was most essential for students of theirparticular subject. Interestingly enough, several similaritiessurfaced across disciplines, as all teachers prized thoughtfulness,substantiated argument, and originality.<p>        On Day Two, we broke out of our departments and intointerdisciplinary groups; each group then developed a masterypresentation for a given department's unifying question. In theafternoon, every group presented and explained its mastery project,providing ample time for the audience to critique and respond to theproposal. The audience included all of the faculty groups, as well asparents, trustees, administrators, graduate students and visitors fromCES.<p>        In total, the faculty brainstormed eight demonstrations duringthe workshop. Here are some representative examples of the workaccomplished on these days:<p>        One group of teachers looked at an essential question developedby the foreign language department: What linguistic and culturalknowledge do I need to journey in a foreign environment? From thisstarting point, they developed suggestions for eleven possibleprojects and concentrated on one called "The Media in Hartford'sHispanic Community." The group broke down the work into three phases:a set of questions (pre-journey), a long list of community resources(journey), and specific suggestions for the final demonstration (post-journey).<p>        The questions for the students addressed language proficiency,the reasons for doing the project, whom to contact in the community,which media to choose, how to get the information, how to record it,how to a select a representative (bi-lingual) audience, and how toshow both language proficiency and subject mastery in the finaldemonstration. The list of community resources included editors of theHartford bi-lingual or Spanish newspapers and magazines, managers ofradio and television stations and community leaders in all areas oflife as well as Hispanic peers at the school. For the finaldemonstration, the students would be expected to keep a journal and aportfolio of newspapers, recordings, taped interviews andtranscriptions of all interactions. They would also be asked todemonstrate time management and sequence of events.<p>        Another group looked at an essential question formulated by thehistory department: What are the causes and effects of change withinand among the cultures of the past and present? The project itimagined would require two students to collaborate on a comparativestudy of the changes brought to two countries by the coming to each ofthe Industrial Revolution. For their presentation to the rest of thefaculty, they used England and Japan as examples. They imagined thateach student would become an expert in one of these island nations --its culture, geography, economics, politics, art, and religion --relative to the period when industrialization arrived. The studentswould collaborate on a study of similarities and differences betweenthe two nations in the two time periods, each bringing individualexpertise to these conversations. For the final exhibition, the twowould then incorporate their individual and mutual findings into adramatic dialogue between two ninety-year-olds, one from each culture,whose lives spanned the years of change, and whose perspectives wereboth informed and wise.<p>        Both of these imagined exhibitions require competence in almostevery academic discipline, as well as in research, writing, publicspeaking, and sophisticated thinking. Both exhibitions recognize thatthe process is just as important as the final demonstration. Bothexhibitions require an extended time period; the time frame, at leasta year, would begin in the junior year and include summer work. Bothexhibitions would be evaluated by a panel of Watkinson faculty andoutside experts.<p>        The October workshop encouraged risktaking and creative problemsolving among the faculty; the interdisciplinary groups discoveredcommon goals and addressed the issues of audience and evaluation. Wefound that the supportive environment of the workshop renewedconfidence and fueled a shared excitement and enthusiasm aboutCoalition teaching. We also found that we experienced the samestruggles and satisfactions as our students. In fact, we went throughexactly the same process that we envision for our students. We wantWatkinson seniors to brainstorm ideas and find connections among thoseideas, determine the scope, decide what is feasible considering theamount of time and available resources, and then design a project thatmeets these criteria.<p>        The workshop proved to be a watershed for the Watkinson faculty.We needed to work as a group over an extended time to exchange ideas,to ask questions and to feel supported. The format provided a forumfor looking back at where we started, looking at where we are now, andlooking ahead toward where we want to go. We saw commonality anddiversity. At the same time, we still have much to do.<p>        As a result of this faculty workshop, we have moved into a pilotmastery program in which interested faculty will work together withthree juniors who agreed to help try out the program. They willexplore the process of putting the concept of exhibitions intopractice. This spring these students will be guided to shape year-longsenior mastery projects. Just as college students select majors, theywill all select a subject area to focus in on; however, like thesample projects that the faculty designed, the students will have toincorporate other disciplines. At this time we are identifying andaddressing the issues, problems and expectations such a program willraise: curriculum requirements, credit, courseload integration,faculty supervision and time needs. We intend to move gradually towardinvolving the entire junior/senior class.<p>        How close are we to developing an exit exhibition that wouldearn graduates a Watkinson diploma? We are not there yet. We are stillstruggling with developing mastery demonstrations for the individualcourse. We now see presentations in many areas and courses, but we donot yet have consensus on format, audience, requirements, orassessment. What are the next steps? We need guidelines and criteria:What makes projects truly outstanding? How do we separate mediocrityfrom excellence? We need to develop these criteria as a whole faculty,and we need to communicate our expectations to our students.<p>        The process of transforming a school is a gradual one. It can bedaunting. It is easy to become discouraged by expecting too much toosoon. In our case, change has been slow but also -- in a sense -- rapid.With each passing year, Coalition principles become more and moreembedded in the Watkinson experience. Now, in our fourth year ofexploration, teachers approach academic work from a thoughtful,interdisciplinary perspective, and students expect to be the majorplayers in their own education. We have the framework established forstudents to engage themselves in sustained inquiry for their seniorexhibitions. Now, we need to make it happen.<p><hr><h2><center>Covering Our Assessment</center></h2><h2>Julia B. Thayer Junior-Senior High School<br>Winchester, New Hampshire</h2><b>Julie Gainsburg, Math Teacher</b><p><hr>        Thayer Junior-Senior High School serves 325 students (grades 7through 12) in a rural community in southern New Hampshire. It hasbeen a member of the Coalition since 1984. At Thayer, community reignssupreme: every teacher and student is part of an interdisciplinaryteam, and all students benefit from an extensive advisory system.Furthermore, Thayer has an apprenticeship program through whichstudents interact regularly with community members, thereby expandingthe school community to include much of the town. Despite nationalacclaim for its innovative programs, however, the school has had tostruggle for years to gain the support of both its community and itsschool board. 7<p>        For the past several years, Thayer's struggle with the issue ofassessment has focused primarily on establishing a "skills-based"diploma. Not surprisingly, this has proven extremely complicated andcontroversial for the Thayer staff. Progress has come in fits andspurts, when we haven't changed direction completely. Our goalthroughout has been to develop a list of Exit-Level Skills -- skillswhich the staff deems essential for a high school diploma -- and asystem whereby all students exhibit mastery of these skills prior tograduation. The purposes of this list are to better clarify course andschool expectations for students and parents and to give greatermeaning to our diploma. We envision the completed skills listaccompanying the Thayer diploma as a "guarantee" of the student'sskills, with the dates of exhibition marked next to each skill.<p>        Six years ago, the Thayer staff began the process of identifyingessential skills for students entering Thayer High School (i.e.,leaving our junior high) and for students graduating. Over the courseof the next year and a half, a committee of fourteen staff membersworked on these lists, as did all subject-area departments. Parentsand students gave their input. In the final document, about ten skillswere listed under each heading, with wide variation. The headingsincluded the traditional subject areas as well as "Problem Solving,""Humanities," "Personal Economics," "Contemporary Studies," and"Survival Skills." Typical examples of skills were: calculate the areaand volume for common household purposes (Personal Economics) andidentify and comprehend the main and subordinate ideas in a writtenwork and summarize them (Reading and Listening).<p>        The lists were approved by the school board, and teachers beganto use them, to varying degrees, in the classrooms. For some teachers,they were merely guides; for others, the lists determined theircurricula (and still do). We even worked with the staff of our feederelementary school to help them understand the lists and how theircurriculum could support us. As the school became ensnared in otherissues in the next few years, however, no official role was assignedto the skills lists, and students continued to be graded and graduatedas usual.<p>        Our junior high, however, took Thayer's first serious steptowards student accountability. Three years ago, the eighth-gradestaff developed a competency test and portfolio requirement to matchthe writing and math skills. The math portion is a written,shortanswer test, while the writing portion contains five parts. Fourare portfolio items: a business letter, a persuasive essay, a shortreport, and a summary, all of which may be coached by teachers. Thefifth is a timed writing sample on a topic of the student's choice(not coached). Students must pass both portions in order to enterninth grade. Eighth-graders who have not passed both by June attendour summer school, which prepares them to pass by the end of thesummer.<p>        To support this effort, the seventh grade staff now administersa diagnostic math test of its own design to all incoming seventhgraders and, where possible, collects writing samples by each studentfrom the sixth grade teachers. This way, the seventh grade staff canidentify the strong and weak areas for these students and begin toprepare them for the eighth grade competency tests. Also, an oldversion of the actual competency test is administered to the seventhgraders at the end of the school year so that the students and eighthgrade staff understand what areas will need the most work in thecoming year.<p>        The eighth-grade competency program has had many positiveoutcomes. It provides clearer goals for the seventh and eighth-gradecurricula, clarifies our expectations, and has been a powerful studentmotivator. It has also been a necessary control of studentpreparedness for Algebra I, which all ninth-graders now take inheterogeneous classes. Finally, because of the timed writing sample, agroup of staff members had to grapple with standards for what hastraditionally been rather subjective skill. As a result, we now have aworkable system for evaluating written pieces, which the entire staffhas used.<p>        With the eighth-grade competency tests in place, our attentionreturned to accountability in the high school. Unfortunately, sincethe original skills lists had been compiled, new teachers had replacedold, and they brought different ideas of what was essential. Morecomplicating, the school had by now been restructured into six"teams": each grade of students (7-12) was assigned three or foursubject-area teachers with a common planning period and four hourblock of teaching time. Each team had been busy developing its ownsubject-integrated curriculum, and many of these skills and goalsseemed to transcend the traditional subject-area categories of the oldskills list. It felt like a step backwards, for example, to takeskills such as "research" and "oral presentation," which were nowguiding our integrated projects, and force them back under subject-area headings (English and history).<p>        Thus began probably the most frustrating and confusing period ofthe whole process. Countless hours were spent recategorizing theskills into six "non-subject" areas -- literacy, expression, ethics/values, personal proficiency, problem-solving, and cultural awareness-- to better accommodate our integrated curriculum. Teachers met againand again, sometimes with their teams, other times with their subject-area departments, and even with a private consultant, to try to figureout systems for skill exhibition, particularly ones that didn't heapthe entire responsibility on the twelfth-grade team. Committees onskills, exhibitions, and portfolios, were formed and reformed.<p>        Many ideas were generated, but they usually created moreproblems than they solved. Our consultant met time and time again withthe different teams, getting information that he would then try tocoordinate and pull together. However, for one reason or another,these efforts never met everyone's satisfaction. The most difficultissue that arose dealt with trying to reconcile these competencieswith the curricula that we had established in our teams. If we, as aschool, selected competencies that every student should develop, thenwho would be responsible for assessing them? Moreover, do you assessthem at the end of the senior year or in an ongoing manner? Andfinally, if students are aware of these competencies early on, canthey move at their own pace to prove to their assessors that they are,indeed, competent? If so, what will happen to classrooms and curriculaas we know them? This struggle went on for more than a year.<p>        Finally, the state government came to our rescue, indirectly.Governor Judd Gregg's Task Force on Education released a bookleturging schools to reform and restructure. Included was a list ofrecommended skills and knowledge for high school graduates. Theseskills so closely resembled the ones we'd listed that adopting themhardly needed any discussion. But the tremendous advantage, besideshaving a finalized list, was to have the implicit backing of the stategovernment.<p>        Our opening faculty meeting this fall (1991) was devoted tocategorizing each of these skills into the one or more mostappropriate subject-area departments. From there, departments furthercategorized their skills by two-year grade-levels: seventh/eighth,ninth/tenth, eleventh/ twelfth. We had by this time established thatthe end of the tenth grade would be another "gate" like the eighth andtwelfth grades, where students would be required to demonstrate acertain competency level (somehow) before moving on to eleventh grade.Now we would consider our school less as six separate stages and moreas three (7/8, 9/10, and 11/12). These pairs of teams would spendseveral faculty meetings beginning to coordinate their curriculum andexpectations.<p>        This school year has brought much forward movement toward ourvision, though new questions are raised at every turn. For eachcourse, teachers have created a new report card listing the dozen orso skills and goals to be assessed. Once these go into officialservice (end of this school year?), our course design will have tomatch these skills, and we must offer specific ways for students toexhibit their mastery. These "report card" skills lists have beencompiled into one large packet, which we shared with the parents at afall conference. Virtually all parents were enthusiasticallysupportive. Many appreciated the greater clarification it wouldprovide of a particular course grade. Others felt it would be aguarantee that kids couldn't "slide" through school (and a few added"like I did!").<p>        While the staff has always worked on exhibitions and alternativeforms of assessment, efforts have been informal and sporadic. Theoriginal vision included student portfolios as evidence of skillmastery, and some student work has been filed into folders over theyears, but exactly what should go into a portfolio had never beenestablished. This year, the twelfth-grade team includes one class in"portfolio," in which students are compiling multi-mediarepresentations of themselves. So far, the contents of the portfolioare the student's choice, but they represent the student's best work.All twelfth-graders have been paired up for the purpose of coachingeach other through this process.<p>        In order to help us tackle the gargantuan task of documentingall these skills, Panasonic provided us with fourteen S-VHS camcordersand twenty "notebook" portable computers. Thayer also applied to IBMand has received twenty-seven computers (soon to be networked), a CD-ROM, and a flatbed scanner, which will allow us to integrate computertechnology with our video capability. With this new technology, wehope to have each Thayer student store all his/her exhibitionselectronically and possibly produce a multi-media "recital" forparents and community prior to graduation. Students and teachers wouldthen be easily able to access previous exhibitions, for ideas,comparison, or even to build further on them. We envision this sharinghappening not only within Thayer, but among schools and parts of thecommunity with similar technology, enabling us to communicate andeventually "standardize" our evaluations of these non-traditionalexhibitions.<p>        With machines and parts still arriving every day, we have hardlybegun the task of "technologizing" our assessment process. Ourstudents, however, have descended upon the equipment like vultures.Many have become quite skilled with the cameras and computers and arenow helping the teachers figure them out!<p>        Many stumbling blocks remain. We have not ascertained which ofthe hundreds of skills in our packet should be required forgraduation, assuming not all will be. We have much time still to spendon the topic of standards -- how we know when a skill is "mastered" andon what level. And the heated debates have already begun over many ofthe "critical" skills, such as cooperation, organization, andpunctuality. Should an uncooperative but otherwise highly skilledstudent be refused a diploma? Must organization be demonstrated in allsubjects to be considered "mastered"? Over what period of time must astudent exhibit punctuality -- a year, a quarter, a week? Our work overthe next few years is certainly cut out for us. On the other hand, ifit can be done at all, we expect the Thayer staff will do it.<p><hr><h2><center>Reflections on Three Stories of Planning Backwards</center></h2><hr>        These three tales point out the strong commitment that Hodgson,Watkinson, and Thayer have made to planning backwards. In all threecases, the investment has been a risky one. Faculty members have hadto look at their schools through lenses that extend beyond theindividual classroom. To this end, as they have honed their visions ofgraduating seniors, they have redefined learning as an integratedexperience that blends different disciplines and different skills,thereby challenging the existing structures and divisions within theirschools.<p>        Planning backwards compelled these schools to delineate clearlytheir purposes. However, this process proved difficult in all cases.Nonetheless, with at least a tentative final destination in mind, theschools then set out to build the roads and structures that helpstudents get there. Hodgson, Watkinson, and Thayer have all mademarked progress. Yet, their paths diverge in ways that are instructivefor schools just starting out. For instance, Hodgson had an idea totry -- Senior Project -- and a small senior class to try it with;therefore, the impetus existed for them to move quickly. This quickimplementation, which worked to Hodgson's benefit, is quite differentfrom the careful and thorough design process that Watkinson has begun,or the slow ironing out of the details that has marked the evolutionof Thayer's outcomes-based diploma.<p>        Since no precise formula for planning backwards exists, it isuseful to have such different processes to consider. Given thecomplexities of planning backwards, each process presents a range ofadvantages and limitations for consideration.<p>        Hodgson used a technique that McDonald (1992) refers to as"platform-building." Platform-building entails deliberately andquickly setting an assessment mechanism into place that honors aschool's vision. With a vision of resourceful, disciplined, lifelonglearners in mind, Hodgson designed and implemented Senior Project, athree-pronged exhibition that combines academic and vocationaldisciplines. As the platform metaphor suggests, the school then had astructure with which to work.<p>        Rather than mull over ideas and logistics, the faculty allagreed on the basic idea and put it into immediate effect. Being ableto build on this idea energized faculty and students alike. Likebuilders, faculty and students in the school have been busy filling inthe gaps, strengthening the platform as well as the foundation onwhich it stands. After a year of hard work, Hodgson had something toshow, which has served to maintain the momentum. Senior Projectexpectations have also had an impact on other features of the school,perhaps most notably in the bridge between Hodgson's academic andvocational curricula. Even though the logistics have becomeincreasingly difficult due to the bigger senior classes, the Hodgsoncommunity feels confident that it has a sound idea and is committed toseeing every student complete Senior Project.<p>        The speed with which Hodgson implemented Senior Project didcause some difficult moments, however. It is hard for schools tocommunicate changes in procedures once they have set them. Confusingfor both teachers and students, making alterations can potentiallyalienate and frustrate these groups even if it is clear from thestart, as it was at Hodgson, that some adjustments will be made. Inthe early stages, some faculty were much less informed because theywere not involved in the design of Senior Project. This range ofinvolvement led to inconsistencies in terms of both commitment andworking with students, and these inconsistencies needed to be -- andwere -- resolved. In the process, the Hodgson planning team developedsome very effective strategies to communicate with the rest of thefaculty.<p>        Watkinson's story mirrors the progression of many Coalitionschools. Having gotten involved with the Coalition at the point intime when the Coalition focus was on changing the classroom first(Muncey and McQuillan, 1991), Watkinson's early efforts encouragedstudents to take more active roles and teachers to act as facilitatorsand coaches. These changes, successfully made, brought the school tothe larger problems of assessing mastery and of establishing a diplomaby exhibition. The school approached these tasks carefully, exploringtheir implications in each department, in each classroom. Then, as aresult of a pivotal staff development workshop, Watkinson began toimagine its students engaged in sustained, self-selected, andinterdisciplinary academic inquiry. This vision has given the school adifferent perspective from which to examine its organization. Atpresent, the faculty is focusing its efforts on simultaneouslypiloting its platform for senior exhibitions with a small group ofstudents, and rethinking ways to alter the school's schedule anddiscipline-driven curriculum so that students will have the time andthe support they need.<p>        Consensus and caution might best describe the approach thatWatkinson has taken. The school's efforts to deepen its work and movebeyond the positive changes that it had made in terms of studentengagement have worked well because the entire faculty, as well asstudents and parents, have been involved in the change process. Thenext steps for Watkinson are very important ones. Since the school hasopted for a slower implementation process, it is possible that itcould lose some of the momentum that resulted from its workshop. Also,just as the varying levels of faculty involvement at Hodgson causedsome confusion, Watkinson's choice to pilot the senior exhibition withonly a few teachers and students could present similar problems. Theschool's biggest hurdles still involve structure; the faculty isunited in its agreement about the importance of a senior exhibition,but it has yet to make choices about how this year of independent,interdisciplinary inquiry will affect a schedule that relies heavilyon isolated departments and strict distribution requirements.<p>        Like Watkinson, Thayer had already made significant changes whenit took on planning backwards. Having firmly established inter-disciplinary teams, an advisory system, and a strong sense of schoolcommunity, the faculty felt that the creation of some kind of moreformalized assessment mechanism to monitor students' progress would bein the best interest of both students and teachers. In an importantsense, the school realized the limitations of thinking about schoolreform only in terms of changing input variables -- one must takeoutputs into consideration, too.<p>        So the Thayer staff decided to specify student outcomes and tobase Thayer's diploma on the demonstration of these outcomes,embarking on the tedious -- and time-consuming -- process of identifyingwhat graduates (and teachers) should be held accountable for, and ofdeveloping ways to integrate these objectives into the school'scurriculum and instruction. In following this path, the school hasconfronted three questions in turn: What should the outcomes be? Whois to be responsible for ensuring that students achieve them? And howcan their achievement be assessed? This is the classic path ofoutcomes-based education whereby "exit outcomes -- the knowledgecompetencies and personal qualities we want students to demonstrateupon leaving school -- are the driving force in designing andconducting instruction in schools" (Spady, 1988, p. 8). As Thayer'sstory shows, clearly publicized and adhered-to outcomes can alsoenhance communication within the school and between the school and itscommunity. In this case, moreover, because Thayer's outcomes closelymatch those issued by the state, the school has also has made an allyout of a major stakeholder while holding fast to its local standards(the two being not incompatible). In the long run, this connectionwill ultimately lighten the school's burden, as Thayer will alreadyhave created systems that respond to the state's mandates.<p>        As the Thayer faculty has discovered, however, the process ofidentifying outcomes and applying them to individual classes mightjust be the easiest part of planning backwards. Thinking holisticallyabout these outcomes is more difficult. Recently, the faculty spentthree hours looking at its outcomes and a myriad of questionssurfaced. Of these outcomes, which are absolutely critical forgraduation? Do students exhibit these outcomes over time or by acertain date at the end of the year? If students demonstrate a skillin one class but not in another, can they be said to havesatisfactorily mastered the skill? These are hard questions that willhave complex answers, and those answers will probably engender evenmore questions.<p>        A reading across these stories raises several issues toprominence. First, all three accounts make clear that, contrary to amore static or linear process, schools that plan backwards areconstantly in motion, and the motion is not always forward. Regardlessof how a school chooses to go about planning backwards, it must beprepared to be reflective about and responsive to questions that ariseand to unanticipated issues that surface. It would be easy for Hodgsonto become complacent now that it is clear that the basic concept ofSenior Project is a good one, for Watkinson to simply add a seniorexhibition on top of its existing organization, or for Thayer toignore the problem of achieving coherence among its many outcomes.However, their accounts all attest to the fact that the schools haveaccepted that planning backwards can be messy, and sometimes eventurbulent. This shows especially in the fact that they all havedeveloped mechanisms, be they special committees or special meetings,to continually take stock of the school's work.8<p>        A second issue, related to the first, is that planning backwardstakes time. All three schools have invested many hours in the hardwork of defining a vision, coming to consensus, and developingstrategies to make themselves accountable for the visions. Theirfaculties know that the reflective practice that strengthens anddeepens their work and that makes planning backwards effectiverequires time for individual as well as group deliberation.<p>        Finally, a third issue is that, in planning backwards, schoolsneed an assessment mechanism, or platform, that is more powerful andmore cohesive than course-level exhibitions. Effective platformschallenge schools to take responsibility for teaching their studentsto ask questions, to take risks, to make connections, and to dorigorous intellectual work. At the same time, they provide feedback tothe school itself, enabling it to ensure output as well as input. Ineffect, all three schools have found a need to establish a platform.The Senior Project at Hodgson, of course, but also the pilot masteryproject at Watkinson, and the new multi-media portfolio at Thayer areall platforms; they assess exit-level mastery in a setting apart fromcourse work, and they also provide the schools with a perch from whichthey can scrutinize how they prepare their kids for graduation.<p><hr><h2>References</h2><hr><dl><dd>Kammaraad-Campbell, S.

McDonald, Coalition of Essential Schools</center></h3><center>October, 1993</center><hr><p><i>The Coalition of Essential Schools gratefully acknowledges the IBM Corporation and the UPS Foundation for their support of its research on Exhibitions.</i><p><i>This article is a slightly revised version of a paper presented at the conference of the National Research Center on Student Learning, University of Pittsburgh, November 5Ð8, 1992.</i> <p><hr>There is a conspiracy of vision amid efforts to remake American schools for the twenty-first century. First among the conspirators are teachers, principals, and university based school reformers who are busy building and supporting exemplars of redesigned schools (Meier, 1992, 1993; Sizer, 1992; Wood, 1992; Fiske, 1991). Most of them labor, wittingly or not, under the abiding influence of their century leaping mentor John Dewey. One sees the influence especially in their commitment to democratic values as the ideological foundation of American education, and in their learner centeredness. <p>Also in the conspiracy are cognitive scientists who have redefined learning and teaching in terms radically at odds with the common practices of American schools (Jones & Idol, 1990; Cohen, McLaughlin & Talbert, 1992; Gardner, 1989, 1991; Perkins, 1992; Bruer, 1993). They are well positioned to dispute the powerful influences on current school design of their predecessors in psychology: the behaviorists with their passion for mincing teaching and learning, and the early theorists of intelligence with their passion for discriminatory measurement (Resnick & Resnick, 1991; Wolf et al., 1991). <p>A third group of conspirators comprises organizational theorists, drawing inspiration from change under way in some American corporations (Senge, 1990; Bolman & Deal, 1991; Mauriel, 1989; Fullan with Stiegelbauer, 1991). Many of their prescriptions are animated by economic anxiety, the United States having a long history of associating economic concerns with school. They suggest in this post-industrial era what their predecessors suggested in the heyday of the industrial behemoth: that what is good for business is good for the schools and vice versa (Callahan, 1962; Marshall & Tucker, 1992). <p>The vision uniting these diverse conspirators embodies a fundamental shift in the very idea of what is supposed to happen in school. The learner does not simply receive knowledge but reconstructs it within a context of prior knowledge, skills, values, and beliefs -- in short, by thinking about it. And the intelligence he or she brings to this thinking is different from what it was formerly presumed to be. First of all, every learner has lots of it, especially when working in groups and with tools. And "it" is not a single thing, but multidimensional. <p>These basic conceptual changes affect in turn the role of the teacher, who becomes less the "deliverer of instruction" and more a cognitive coach working across domains as well as within them, a guide to worlds that extend beyond classrooms and beyond the teacher's own expertise. They affect also the organizational contexts for learning. "Direct instruction" in isolated, departmentalized classrooms yields to the construction of a community of learners and teachers, sharing common standards, striving for connections, staying open intellectually, cultivating and respecting diverse viewpoints. And this community operates within a larger educational system that is based on shared accountability rather than hierarchical responsibility. <p>Of course, vision alone is never enough to create change. And there is always the chance that this vision -- like its predecessors of the 1960s and 1930s -- will float above most American schools and never come to ground. If so, the fault will likely lie in the folly that Seymour Sarason identifies (1971, 1990), namely, that most proponents of good educational ideas consider schools the mere nodes of a complex system rather than complex systems in their own right. Whether school reform is launched from the outside or the inside of schools, it typically follows a linear strategy; hence, the effectiveness of some intervention is presumed to be intrinsic to the intervention itself, rather than a function of whether its impact is managed to good effect inside a turbulent world. <p>This is true even of many so called systemic initiatives. These typically struggle to delineate and integrate policies bearing on the school -- but, in the process, end up treating the school itself as if it were a simple switch that could be turned on by a remote source. Similarly, reform initiatives launched on the inside of schools -- by principals or small groups of teachers, and with or without consultants -- typically put too much trust in stimuli: a new policy or structure or a dose of professional development. <p>Finally, both outside reformers and inside reformers often seem to forget that schools always exist within fractious communities. As George Counts put it in a sarcastic reference to the systemic initiatives of his own day: the Chicago public schools have always been, and probably always will be, for better or worse, in Chicago (Counts, 1928).<p>But what if it were otherwise? What if policy makers at all levels promoted the vision sketched above while respecting schools as they really are? Several colleagues and I at the Coalition of Essential Schools have studied this and other related questions over the course of nearly three years by means of a close study of ten public high schools.1 The schools are in nine states with contrasting policy contexts. They also offer contrasting settings -- four urban, five suburban, one rural. We selected these particular schools to study because they seemed to offer a valuable dual perspective on the problems of achieving a reform genuinely oriented to the vision presented here. First, their experience suggests that such reform is possible, despite all difficulties. Second, their experience also suggests that it is nearly impossible, contrary to all hype. <p>What the schools share is a serious intention to redesign themselves. Of course, they exercise this intention within a real world full of contrary influences that especially include the following three: 1) ambivalence on the part of some or most of the schools' clients -- both parents and students; 2) resistance by the hierarchical systems that enmesh most of the schools; and 3) certain deep dynamics of the status quo that can snare serious reform like an undertow snares a swimmer. <p>Of these three foes, the first can be overcome only through vigorous and politically skillful community outreach, which some of the schools in our study seem capable of undertaking and others not. The second can be overcome only through the thoughtful redesign of state and district policies, which is under way in some of the contexts of our study, though by no means all. But the third may be the hardest foe of all, since the deep dynamics that it is comprised of go generally unnoticed and unnamed even in such schools as those in our study. And one cannot overcome what one has not yet noticed and named.<p>In what follows, I name what I take to be seven dynamics of the status quo suggested by our data. My purpose in naming them is not to suggest a definitive list but rather to encourage other researchers and reformers to presume the existence of some such set of deep-system dynamics and to do their own work of naming and illuminating. Although I also mention in the case of each of the seven dynamics one or two promising strategies for dealing with them -- again suggested by our data -- I believe that most of the work of inventing such practices still lies ahead. So my second purpose here is to encourage such invention, especially by the people who run schools and work in them. Finally, I have a third purpose, one that undergirds this paper's concluding section, in which I use these seven dynamics to construct a template to serve the design and evaluation of educational policy. <hr><h2>Seven School DynamicsConstraining Deep Change</h2><hr><li><b>A centripetal tendency to central authority against shared leadership. </b><p>One sees this tendency not only in schools but throughout the educational system. So there is the abundance of "systemic" initiatives in states and at the national level that all propose to employ a larger, more centrally placed lever. Energies run toward the "center" at the expense of what is mistakenly seen as the periphery; namely, actual relationships between teachers and learners. The tendency is exacerbated in times of change, since only enormous leverage is perceived to be capable of shifting an enormous weight. <p>Complicating the picture at the school level is a tacit treaty that grants too much management authority to the principal and too much curricular and standard-setting authority to isolated teachers (Johnson, 1990). Again, this tendency may ironically be strengthened in times of change, since only the principal in most contexts can wield enough power to marshal the outside resources that change demands and to face off the outside threats it generates. But how can the principal be strong enough on the outside without throttling the development on the inside of middle-leadership structures? The problem, of course, is that the vision sketched above of a community of learners and teachers requires such structures. How else, for example, can a school achieve genuinely shared standards?<p>Our data suggest that even the rare principal who is aware of this dilemma and who manages it successfully may nonetheless face opposition from the school's "best" teachers, since the definition of "best teaching" may rest on a presumption of isolation -- wherein one sets standards that heroically exceed the norm, shutting out the world beyond one's classroom in order to focus energy exclusively on the kids. From the perspective of such teaching, the vision above may imply an abandonment of academic freedom.<p>The most promising strategies we have seen in our study sample for confronting this dynamic involve accountability mechanisms requiring collaboration across classrooms and subjects. In the schools we studied, these mechanisms have proved more effective in achieving shared leadership than have mechanisms for shared governance. Typically, they involve performance assessment systems invented by the schools themselves, sometimes combined with "descriptive reviews" or other mechanisms to focus on the needs and experiences of students who might otherwise elude notice (Weaver, 1992). In some of the schools, these systems have grown quite elaborate and seem to be driving other changes (McDonald et al., 1993).<p>Yet, where they operate, these systems have also tended to alienate some subset of the faculty, among them some of the most successful practitioners of isolated teaching. In some cases this alienation has led such teachers to leave the school, and in at least one case, it has provoked considerable concern among parents and students. <p>An effective way to deal with this situation, according to our evidence, is to acknowledge the tension, share with all concerned the rationale for change, and then insist on the change despite the possible loss of good people. But, of course, these tasks typically require what is called a "strong" principal -- and, indeed, most of the schools in our study have had one. Thus, shared leadership is purchased, ironically, by an exertion of central authority. That may not be problematic so long as the principal who originated the change, and cares about shared leadership, remains in the job. Our study suggests that this may not be long, however; in two years, the principalships in half of our ten schools have changed hands.<p><li><b>An overreliance on group instruction at the expense of individual learning. </b><p>Even space and time in school are defined in terms of groups: classrooms and class hours. Being in school typically means being unremittingly part of a crowd. Of course, one of school's necessary functions is to teach children how to be part of a crowd, and certain kinds of "crowds" -- for example, discussion groups and cooperative task groups -- are essential for particular kinds of learning. <p>But students also need opportunities for genuinely independent inquiry and for self-directed application and synthesis of the concepts they acquire (Gardner, 1989, 1991). It is not enough to consign these experiences to homework and seat work, since they require more time and resources than homework allows for and more space and personal freedom than seat work permits. The writer of a recent essay excoriating the excessive controls of school reveals that he got an idea for the essay while opening a can of chili (Brown, 1992). If they are to function as intellectuals in school rather than as empty vessels, students too need some opportunity to intersperse concentration and productive distraction, to open cans of chili.<p>We did not find much chili-cooking in the high schools of our study (outside the cafeteria kitchens, that is); nor, in general, did we find much of the off-task informality of behavior and decor one finds in some independent and alternative high schools -- or indeed in many ordinary elementary-school classrooms. That is a pity, since in the best circumstances such environments help create a sense of intellectual community independent of the instructional schedule. Ideally, what one wants is intellectual ownership -- that a high school student might occasionally think of the study of math, for example, as an interest and commitment extending beyond the time she must sit in her math classroom or at her desk or kitchen table working on highly directed homework. But this presumes that the school allots time and space for anything else, and that somehow this allotment manages to suggest that the intellectual focus of school does not stop at each classroom's threshold, that the rest of the school's space and time are not reserved for the distinctly unintellectual. By and large, the schools in our study did not handle this challenge very well.<p>Nonetheless, we found among them other promising practices relevant to dealing with this second dynamic. Several schools had collapsed the instructional schedule into large blocks of time managed by small teams of teachers, wherein students enjoy greater opportunity to do more than sit attentively at small desks. Some of the schools also encourage, or even require, community-based learning, allotting time and other resources to it. Finally, most of the schools in our study encourage project-based learning, which is undergoing a resurgence as well in other innovative schools (Olson, 1993). <p>Some of the project work we saw happened within courses, but -- in a particularly encouraging development -- some happened outside, too. In several cases, projects fulfill graduation requirements that exist on top of Carnegie unit requirements. In another case, while projects afford students the opportunity to gain "honors-level" distinction for courses, the project work itself happens entirely outside the courses' purview. In all cases, the project work in these schools has tended to foster teaching relationships and learning formats different from norms of classroom-based teaching and learning. In a few places it has also led to the introduction of new units of time and space -- project and tutorial "periods," offices for teachers, project rooms where resources and supports for learning are generalized and students establish their own work priorities and routines.<p><li><b>The habit of maintaining custody of students through close supervision.</b><p>The custodial imperative is strong in practice and often in law: schools must hold students in custody while they teach them. The imperative is derived from reasonable concerns for safe and from sensible awareness of the role that good direction plays in learning. Yet it is often entangled with compulsive attitudes about human behavior and with misconceptions about how people learn. Thus, the close supervision of life in many schools -- over studying, playing, eating, going to the bathroom, and especially working, thinking, and expressing oneself -- ends up hobbling learning rather than enhancing it. Indeed, it often proves counter-productive in maintaining custody, since many children held too tightly overall look continuously for places to spring loose. Finally, it impedes the growth of a learning culture by suppressing two of the most important tools of intellectual growth, namely, curiosity and conflict. In the interest of maintaining custody, schools function in myriad ways to prevent the kind of straying from task that is curiosity's currency, and to prevent as well the expression and exploration of disagreement. <p>So a school's people are packed safely into their respective places: the student seated silently at his little desk, the teacher standing behind her big desk, the principal shuffling papers at his still bigger desk, and the assistant principal conducting "hall sweeps" with a walkie-talkie. In such circumstances, some simple and necessary rituals of a learning culture -- for example, regular and spirited faculty meetings, school convocations, and forays into the outside world -- may be viewed as threats to the custodial status quo. Any more radical departures from the norm may be seen as utterly impossible.<p>The project-based learning experiences mentioned above in association with the second dynamic lend themselves to resisting this third dynamic, too. Especially powerful are opportunities to pursue a project outside the school walls during school hours. Indeed, any community-based learning experiences -- for example, community service requirements and internships -- are helpful in promoting the idea that schools can teach indirectly as well as directly, and that mechanisms can be invented to keep students safe and productive even in the most difficult environments. Helpful in another way are the advisory and governance systems we saw in a few of our study's schools, designed to foster personal responsibility and a sense of community.<p><li><b>The tendency to turn inward and to discount outside perspectives. </b><p>This tendency is expressed in various, and even conflicting, ways. So there is disdain for parents, and also fear of them. They are openly welcomed, but as guests, not "family." And parent involvement is (in private) depicted negatively by many teachers, even as reformers are clamoring for new and better programs to support it. Similarly, businesses are invited to "adopt" schools, but find themselves frozen out of any influence on the adopted school's operations.<p>As for researchers, there is a persistent perception among school people that researchers are hopelessly out of touch with the realities of schooling, though schools also exhibit a tendency to inflate the value of research findings. This paradox is a derivative of the quest for nostrums -- much encouraged by the cottage industries of school improvement and "in-service" professional development -- and ultimately self-sealing. "We tried that already" is the chant of an enterprise prone to frequent and superficial innovation, one used to the translation of even radical ideas into shopworn practice. <p>Finally, in still another manifestation of this dynamic, there is a perilously shortsighted tendency to discount the importance of educational policy, particularly at the state or national level. This is part of the closed door syndrome, the confidence that nearly every teacher carries within that if worse comes to worst, she can always close her door and do whatever she pleases inside her own classroom. Of course, the reliance on this safety valve is a powerful disincentive to build genuine collegiality, to maintain common standards, to engage in team teaching, and to otherwise participate in the construction of the vision outlined above.<p>Among the ten study schools, we have seen a number of promising strategies aimed at undoing the various dimensions of this dynamic. One involves attempts to ensure that a significant number of people who work in a school live in the community that supports the school and are in other respects connected with that community. Once again, community-based learning experiences are powerful here, too, insofar as they dispute the idea of the school as a self-reliant institution. Also effective are efforts to link the inside and the outside of schools through telecommunications, though these are in a very early stage of development in our study's schools. <p>One promising strategy we have observed is counterintuitive. It involves a reconceptualization of the school's relationship to outside expertise. Conventionally, schools "receive" new knowledge about curriculum, methods of instruction, and so on from intermediate agencies who provide policy interventions, textbook changes, "technical assistance," and "inservicing." By contrast, all ten schools in our study are relatively experienced in inventing their own knowledge about these things. They are members of a network, the Coalition of Essential Schools, one that is increasingly led by people who work in schools, one that increasingly generates its own cross-school consulting expertise. One result is that a significant proportion of the study's schools seems to be in charge of their own professional development in a way that is quite rare. <p>That is not to say that the schools regard themselves as selfsufficient. In fact, we have observed a contrary effect in these schools, which is why I say that this strategy is counterintuitive. Because these schools feel more confident in assessing their own needs and more aware of their own capacity to address them, they are also more deliberate about soliciting outside consultation when that consultation is appropriate. Indeed, this is the key difference: that these schools hire consultants rather than inservice providers. In an exceedingly promising development, there are even signs that one or two of the schools are having an impact on state policy by demanding that it align with the schools' innovations.<p><li><b>The assumption that the school's essential function is meritocratic.</b><p>Much of what is demanded by economic circumstances, specified by new conceptions of intelligence and learning and suggested by new views of an optimally functioning organization runs counter to the idea of school as sorting mechanism. But the idea is deeply ingrained in practice and easily survives rhetorical assault. "All students will achieve at high levels," says the school, in accordance with the state's new goals; but in the hearts of principals, teachers, and parents, conditions are added: ".Ê.Ê. in proportion to their abilities .Ê.Ê. within the traditional hierarchy of achievement .Ê.Ê. consistent with their family background .Ê.Ê. given their probable career paths" and so on. <p>As in all winnowing organizations, the worth of individuals is defined by very narrow criteria -- one's GPA, one's willingness to bake cookies for the senior bake sale, one's capacity for speaking and thinking like the majority or elite group. In some of the most socio-economically homogeneous communities in the United States, schools act as if their function were to manufacture status differences. Undergirding this is the widespread attachment to a theory of intelligence as a unitary, maldistributed, and easily measurable "gift" from the gene pool: each kid is so many ounces smart and so many ounces dumb. <p>Taken as a whole, the schools in our study would seem to be less meritocratic in their orientation than most high schools, some of them astonishingly so. Yet, buffeted especially by parental fears and expectations, most also harbor meritocratic practices. In this respect, they mirror the views of most Americans whose own experiences in schools and in the economy seem to belie the idea that all people really can be taught to use their minds well.<p>The most promising practice in confronting this dynamic that we have seen involves more than the simple substitution of heterogeneous classes for tracked ones. That can lead easily to parental backlash, despite all assurances of research findings on the value of heterogeneity -- and, indeed, this has happened in one of our study's schools. A better strategy is to strive for an optimal balance between heterogeneity and differentiation. The former emphasizes the value of diverse perspectives, intelligences, and skills; it highlights methods like seminar-based learning, problem-based learning, and cooperative learning. The latter acknowledges that students differ in all kinds of ways -- and especially in ways that do not show up on intelligence tests and do not cut across the entire spectrum of human capacity; it highlights methods like individual project work or intense instructional environments, as in advanced foreign language training or advanced computer science. The goal here is to reconstitute the school as a community of equal intellectual strivers, all of whom pursue some areas of specialization.<p><li><b>The tendency to define teaching as a narrative activity.</b><p>In this image of their work, teachers, like novelists, construct narrative bridges across the incomprehensibility of experience viewed close up. They build these narratives with material supplied by scholarship they've encountered, curriculum frameworks from various sources, stories they too were taught, and, of course, textbooks. They invest themselves in these stories and believe in the transformative power of them (McDonald, 1992). <p>For their part, learners yield themselves to the power of the stories, though it is also presumed that, like good readers, they will eventually turn a critical eye. Yet the turn of this critical eye -- the opportunity to reconstruct what has been "delivered" -- is often expected to happen, if it happens at all, in the student's own time and space, outside the teacher's purview. That's for homework, for private study in preparation for the unit test, for college. The result is a phenomenon much in evidence in today's schools: "But I taught him," the teacher says. "It's not my problem if he didn't learn."<p>The new vision for teaching outlined at the start of this paper needs a different metaphor from that of teaching as narrating. Cognitive scientists, among others, suggest scaffolding as a substitute, or coaching (Paris & Winograd, 1990; Sizer, 1984, 1992). In both cases, the new metaphor suggests that what matters after all is what the student constructs, not what the teacher intends. Both metaphors also imply an enormous shift in the strategies of schoolkeeping as well as teaching. Teachers now teach like storytellers partly because the setup of most schools suggests that they do. This involves some of the features discussed above -- the reliance on large group instruction, the custodial role of teachers, the centripetal habit of school that makes the teacher as powerful within a single room as the principal is powerful within his domain and the superintendent within hers. It also involves the idea of curriculum as something parceled out and covered, the didactically oriented furnishings of most classrooms, and the loneliness of teaching. <p>Addressing this dynamic in our study's schools has often involved the assiduous cultivation of alternative norms. One school has devoted years of work and training to seminar-based teaching. Others are nearly as devoted to other nondidactic methods like cooperative learning and project-based learning. Yet in all these schools, the narrative grip has been weakened rather than broken. The effect seems strongest where the cultivation of other methods has been combined with the adoption of longer teaching blocks and some team-teaching. It is harder to be a storyteller for two hours straight than it is for forty-five minutes at a time. And it is harder to tell joint stories than to tell one's own. <p>In fact, it may be that to plan together in any extended way, teachers must come to terms with the fact that human beings do not communicate directly from head to head and heart to heart, but always through media and always on the basis of a mutual construction of meaning conditioned by values. The insight then pays off in their teaching, where they leave more room for this mutual construction -- more pauses in the story.<p><li><b>The tendency to privilege teacher performance over student performance.</b><p>This tendency derives from the two preceding tendencies, but it is anchored also in a well-meaning conspiracy to encourage students and to preserve teachers' self-esteem. Thus the exhibition of student performance is reserved typically for only the best and most finished work -- the papers that get tacked to the bulletin board, the speeches that are delivered at the assembly, the project that makes it to the science fair. Lost amid this conspiracy are opportunities for students to struggle openly with difficult tasks among multiple coaches and the varied perspectives of other strugglers, for them to grasp thereby that minds construct their own understandings, and for them to tolerate thereby the fact that failure is an essential ingredient in the pursuit of intellectual achievement.<p>In a book by Philip Jackson and his colleagues (1993), the researchers ponder in one passage the significance of the fact that, in a wall display, one teacher has hung a student's crudely drawn map of Sierra Leone amid his classmates' more carefully drawn maps of other African countries. Does it mean, they wonder, that the teacher doesn't see or value the difference? Their question is appropriate, since that may be, in fact, the case; but the question also illustrates the problem here. In fact, teachers cannot teach for understanding by encouraging and permitting the exhibition of impressive performance only. In an important sense, understanding is performance (Gardner, Perkins & Perrone, 1992) -- or at least one cannot work on it, either as teacher or student, in any other mode. So student performance must come out from the margins of school. <p>Getting it out will not be easy, however. Ironically, the current infatuation with performance-based assessment may hurt rather than help, since it implicitly fosters a judgmental climate, and suspicions of a judgmental climate are exactly what keeps performance marginalized. The teacher and sometimes the student fear that someone else, upon seeing an unimpressive performance, may privately think, "So, this is supposed to be good!" The solution, of course, is the cultivation of a performance-based culture for learning and teaching -- one within which assessment plays a role. Trying to get there by overemphasizing that role, however, may prove counterproductive. <p>On the other hand, a number of the schools in our study use performance assessment to good effect in addressing this dynamic (McDonald et al., 1993). The difference may be that they control the terms of its use rather than suffering its imposition. Most of the schools call these performance assessments exhibitions, the term favored by the Coalition of Essential Schools. One school has even preserved some of the term's eighteenth-century connotation through its use of Exhibition Days -- occasions when the school invites outsiders to come inside in order to observe and evaluate actual student performance (McDonald, 1993). The point is to accustom these visiting stakeholders -- as well as the school's own teachers and students -- to a face-to-face accountability grounded in the real understandings of real kids. </ol><p><hr><h2>A Template for Policy</h2><hr>The dynamics described above are not elements in a deterministic scheme to thwart all attempts at genuine school reform in the United States. Nor am I at all pessimistic about the ultimate chances of such reform. I simply believe those chances rest upon -- among other things like luck, pluck, and the imagination of school leaders -- the willingness of all reformers to acknowledge the real features of the environment they address. <p>If I am right in assuming that the dynamics we discerned in our small sample of high schools are integral features of this environment, then they must be dealt with. In particular, any policy that aims to promote the vision of schooling outlined at the start of this chapter must be constructed with the dynamics in mind. To serve this purpose, I propose a template -- a simple list of seven questions, each tied to a dynamic -- to superimpose on some real or imagined policy implementation: How is this policy likely to affect the balance between central and shared leadership in schools? Will this policy likely enhance or disturb the over-reliance of schools on grouping? And so on. <p>Of course, the purpose of such a tool is not to serve the construction of some universal school reform policy, one capable in a single swipe of neutralizing all seven dynamics. It is merely to help the reformer anticipate the likely pattern of environmental backlash her reform will generate and to offer valuable counsel: "Better make a frontal assault here. Go easy there and you'll just get a minor but tolerable skirmish." Of course, some dynamics will always appear more salient than others in a particular case, but sometimes the low-lying ones need just as much attention. <p><hr><h3>Applying the Template</h3><hr>Let's try out the template on a real policy, one described recently in an Education Week article headlined "Mass. Leads Mounting Charge Against Ability Grouping" (Schmidt, 1993).2 The military rhetoric of the headline notwithstanding, the Massachusetts policy described here, while forthrightly derived from the vision I discuss above, is also sensibly circumscribed. It aims to discourage the grouping of students by perceived ability through the award or denial of state funds earmarked for dropout prevention and remedial education, but it focuses nearly exclusively on middle schools. According to statistics cited in the article, it is enjoying some success to date. Can the template suggest why this may be so, and what obstacles may lie ahead?<p>The policy has certainly stirred number 5, the assumption that the purpose of school is meritocratic, which appears the most salient in this application of the template. There is some evidence in the article to suggest, however, that the policy avoids direct confrontation with the theory of intelligence that undergirds this dynamic. By encouraging "heterogeneous grouping," for example, the policy may appear implicitly to endorse the validity of what are undoubtedly crudely conceived status differences: she's got this much ability, while he has that much more, yet they may profitably learn together in the same group. <p>Meanwhile, the policy seems to acquiesce to number 2 -- the focus on grouping as the basic organizational principle of teaching. It makes the pragmatic argument that mixed groups offer a better deal to the least "bright" students in terms of "reaching their full potential," as well as to the state in terms of its interest in preventing dropouts. The policy is working well at the middle-school level, but it is probably headed for trouble in that bastion of meritocracy, the high school. It might fare better there, however, if its basic argument were revised to something like the following: Current grouping practices are based on crude and invalid measures. As such, they severely constrain all individual learners' opportunities to excel. What is wanted is less grouping overall, with more opportunity for students to follow a relatively independent course, with most remaining large groups designed to provide the benefits of diverse perspectives. <p>Of course, were the state to direct the policy in the way I suggest, it would likely stir up three other dynamics. No. 3: How will schools maintain custody if not by means of grouping? No. 6: How can teachers actually teach to diverse groups without aiming at the middle and losing their audience at the extremes? And No. 7: What will students do in school if they are not always paying attention to their teachers? I stand by my advice, nonetheless, since I think it is these three dynamics -- quiescent though they may now seem in Massachusetts -- that really block efforts to detrack schools. In fact, any detracking policy that does not stir them up risks doing nothing much of lasting value, in my view.<p>Of course, whenever the state does stirring of any kind, it risks the wrath of dynamic number 4 -- that the school will close its doors to the meddling world outside. What does this policy do to prevent this? Well, it smartly eschews mandate, since, as the article reveals, it would first have to seek authority to mandate in this area. So it works with the carrot and stick of funding awards and denials, and also with the bully pulpit. The state's lead person on the issue is clearly conversant with the research in the area and seems savvy as well in how to use it to affect the climate of opinion. For example, references in the article suggest that he has cultivated the support of the state's child advocacy groups and perhaps also of the teacher education establishment. There is no suggestion, however, that he is at work on the most difficult constituency of all, namely, parents.<p>In the matter of the policy's impact on dynamic number 1, the centripetal tendency in leadership, the record is mixed. The state is involved here, albeit in a restrained role, and only the federal government is more remote from where the real action is. But it so happens, according to the article, that a federal court is currently hearing a complaint by the NAACP against tracking in the Amherst-Pelham school district. The combination of a little muscle from the state plus the threat of a lot of muscle from a federal court has induced centripetal tendencies as well at the school level. The article quotes a couple of principals who are clearly "mounting" their own "charge" for heterogeneous grouping, perhaps making it the defining issue of their principalships. It also quotes one principal -- from the Amherst-Pelham district -- who has obviously staked out a spirited position for himself on the other side of the issue, which is portrayed throughout the article (and perhaps implicitly by the policy) as two-sided. <p>Of course, certain elements of this issue -- those involving equity -- are perhaps best viewed as two-sided: either schools treat all their students equitably or they do not. Other elements are best considered multifaceted: over the entire course of schooling, what is the optimal balance among independence and group contexts, small groups and large groups, common perspectives and diverse perspectives, task-oriented groups and process-oriented groups, and so on?<p>So that is how one applies the template. One first considers which of its seven dynamics seem most salient in a particular case and why, and then which seem most quiescent and why. In the process, one mentally jiggles each of the dynamics in order to imagine the probable effect on the others. Is the application useful in the Massachusetts case? Only those who know the case can say for sure; it is much easier to do policy analysis on the few circumstances one can glean from a newspaper article than it is on actual circumstances. But it can only help visionary policy making for those involved in it to try any exercise, however imperfect, that may help them gain a school's eye perspective.<p><hr><h2>References</h2><hr><dl><dd>Bolman, L.

The signals are everywhere: in the way teachers and students speak to eachother, the way work is carried out at every level, the way rules are made andbent and broken, even the slumps or smiles of the office or custodial staff.What is valued in a school comes across in a hundred subtle ways, rarelyarticulated. Yet in the end everything by which we conventionally judge schoolsmay depend on it --whether students show up; what they strive for and achieve;how they use their minds to solve the problems that confront them.<p>   Probably the most difficult to define of the nine principles EssentialSchools hold in common is the seventh, which calls for decency, trust, and"unanxious expectation" as integral aspects of a good school. Depending on whothey are, people may mean vastly different things by decency. Does a decentschool hire teachers supplied by the district's bureaucracy, for instance, evenif they share no common cause with the program? Does it assign them on]y as manystudents in a day as they can reasonably know individually? Does it ask studentsto memorize the Bill of Rights in history class, then order them to shut up andsit down, or else? Does it honor through rituals the intellectual and socialqualities it purports to value, and publicly expose those it condemns? How doesit decide what is fair?<p>   How individuals answer questions like these contributes to a definition ofdecency that cannot be pinned down to one aspect of what we have come to callschool culture. Nor can it be isolated from the definition offered implicitly bythe community, whose attitudes and expectations profoundly influence studentslong before they enter the doors of school. Instead, decency is a dynamic --ahabit of mind and behavior that permeates a school and its surrounding contextat every level, in both formal and informal ways. Exploring the elements of thatdynamic, and the connections between these elements, can reveal much --not onlyabout a school's outlook on what is desirable behavior, but about its commitmentto other Essential School principles as well.<p><hr><h2>Respect</h2><hr>"When a school's culture reflects respect for kids and their potential, that's atone of decency," says Pat Wasley, a Coalition researcher who spends much of hertime observing in schools and writing case studies about school change. "In goodschools, teachers don't blame students for their deficiencies, but insteadreflect on their role in bringing them along." But over the last few decades,Wasley says, conditions in our society have changed to the point where the verynorms of respect have altered as well. Teachers who no longer feel valuedthemselves grow used to an adversary atmosphere among teachers, administrators,parents, and students; they may devalue their students unthinkingly, passingalong an ethic of thoughtless disrespect as a matter of course. This can show upas sarcasm or ridicule in the classroom, and as something close to despair asteachers talk privately among themselves.<p>   Contrasting two public schools in the Coalition of Essential Schools offers astriking illustration of how pervasively and fundamentally the climate ofrespect in a district and community can affect teachers and students in theclassroom. Both examples are well established schools in small cities; bothstarted in the 1970s with a core of deeply committed and idealistic teachers,many of whom grew up in the district and are still teaching there today. Bothserve no more than 500 students, housed in old but well-kept school buildings inpoor sections of town. Both have a sturdy advisory system in place, which linkseach teacher to fifteen or so students; a casual, distinctly personal atmosphereprevails in the halls and classrooms of each.<p>   But sit with teachers in the faculty lounge for long, and at one of theseschools an underlying bitterness, anger, and ennui begin to emerge --attitudeswhich sometimes carry over into the classrooms in the form of low expectationsand conventionally passive instructional techniques. "This school used to be mywhole life," one teacher told me. "l would live here on weekends; the kids wouldcall me Mom. Now I look around and kids are lying to me; they don't come throughon their commitments; the parents don't come to conferences and exhibitions. I'mjust not willing to be everything for these kids that the world isn't willing todo. Not for this salary. Not at my age." She sighed and shook her head. "We'regetting old," she said. "All of us idealistic young teachers are getting old andtired. And we have mortgages."<p>   It was a comment echoed several times by her colleagues, explaining why theyused traditional texts and worksheets instead of projects and presentations, whythey limited their emotional investment in their students. "We used to teachacross the disciplines, even if it didn't fit precise curriculum categories,"one said. "Now the district and the state are insisting on strict adherence toour certification specialties; our evaluations and our jobs depend on it. Itkind of takes the wind out of your wanting to try new things." Another teacherasked angrily, "What are these kids doing from two in the afternoon to ten atnight? They're not reading; they're not doing their homework. I have to read tothem in class to make sure they even know what we're talking about. You startsending me kids whose parents care about them; stop giving me 135 kids in a day,in classes of over 30 at a time. Pay me enough so I don't have to run a businessin the rest of my time, just to make a decent living. Then I'll talk aboutchanging the way I teach."<p>   What causes this kind of disillusionment to infect a school where so muchelse is going right? Overwhelmed and depressed by the scope of the task theirsociety sets them, these teachers also feel ignored and unsupported by that samesociety as they struggle to meet the challenge. No one aspect of school culture,it seems, is separable from any other --which is why aspiring Essential schoolsoften face such frustration as they attempt to move one step at a time towardschool change. One cannot just change classroom pedagogy or expectations; onemust also engage parents in raising their own expectations and asking their ownquestions. One cannot just excuse a school from certain district requirements;one must allow its teachers the appropriate autonomy and flexibility to shapetheir own program to meet the needs of their students. One cannot ask teachersto care about every student without limiting the number of students to areasonable size. Without this kind of mutual respect in a community and adistrict, trying to engage students and teachers in fruitful academic work is asmeaningless as the mother who lets her daughter go swimming but warns, "Hangyour clothes on a hickory stick, and don't go near the water." If at any levelthe structure of thoughtful behavior breaks down --classroom, community, schoolgovernance, state control --the health of the school climate is at risk.<p>   A few hundred miles away, another group of faculty sits together on a Fridaymorning, talking about their students as they do weekly at this time. This is a"last chance" school for students who have failed to thrive elsewhere in thesystem, and the problems they speak of are horrendous: one boy is involved inorganizing a prostitution ring; a girl is pregnant for the sixth time in thepast few years; a boy with serious learning disabilities must be integrated intoa small group project despite his functional illiteracy. Yet these teachers seemrelaxed and optimistic. They speak almost lovingly of their students, even theproblem cases; there is an underlying confidence that their school's system willserve them well. No classes meet on Fridays; many students are at work theschool has helped arrange. Later in the morning, each teacher will pay a homevisit to four or five of the students they advise, talking with parents if theyare there, checking out how things are going. On class days, it is not unusualfor a teacher to drop into another's classroom and lend a hand with a project ordiscussion. "We know each other so well that we can tell at a glance who needs alittle support," one fifteen-year veteran of the faculty said.<p>   This school and its district have chosen to radically redefine the structureand function of the school, so they might focus maximum attention on reorientingstudents towards succeeding in their lives. Kids come to this school by choice;many of them hold down jobs, have babies who come to the school's day carecenter, and face grinding personal challenges at home. But students come onlyfor the morning or the afternoon, four days a week, which brings class sizesdown to manageable levels and allows teachers time to advise and plan. Anintense focus on individual success permeates not just socialworker-styleconcerns, but fundamental intellectual interactions as well. Every piece ofclass work, every assessment, every report card comment is based on theteacher's intimate knowledge of what this student can be expected to accomplish,and how far he or she has come toward an expressly stated goal. And eachsemester, some thirty or forty students graduate, after a public exhibition ofmastery, in an extraordinarily personal celebration that marks theirsatisfactory completion of academic work and their readiness to enter the world.<p>   In what might be seen as desperate circumstances, this district acted tostrip down this school to its barest function as these teachers define it: amutual respect for the individual potential of each student, and a determinationto allow that potential room to grow. With this as a guiding principle, teachershere seem not trapped but energized by the frustrating obstacles in their paths.Their district expects them to treat students as people worthy of respect, andmodels this by respecting their own need for the time and structure that allowsit. Their principal has been with them from the school's start; her own youngchildren play down the hall in the same day care program that students' childrenattend. The senior boy who shows us around brags of his favorite class, astudent-run bakery and restaurant that integrates academics with job skills in afunctioning business setting. In a large open library area, around a big table,teachers sit together and read eleventh-grade essays for a district competencytest, comparing papers and chatting about how their students measure up againstdistrict standards. There is an atmosphere of confidence and calm. Theseteachers are paid no more than the usual low salaries for the region, but theyseem truly happy in their jobs.<p>   More common, however, even within the Coalition, are schools that strugglewith an overload of students, an undersupply of funds and time, and considerabledivision among their faculties as to the purpose and vision of the school. Evenin schools from relatively untroubled communities, which may enjoy a reputationfor excellence, fostering thoughtful and respectful attitudes is no easy task,especially if change is in the wind. Teachers may vie for the "best" studentsand courses. Out of fear for their own turf they may sabotage, undermine, orpassively resist efforts to change. They may resent reform initiatives that failto recognize them as equal partners. Add to this a measure of poor communicationor disagreement over goals between community and school, and one has a recipefor mistrust that can easily cook into mutual disrespect.<p><hr><h2>Intellectual Decency</h2><hr>How does that trust or mistrust, respect or disrespect affect what goes on atthe heart of the school, the relation between teachers and students in theclassroom? The intellectual tasks set for students, the ways students work witheach other, the demonstration and assessment of their skills all reflectfundamental assumptions about what a school considers decent and valuablebehavior.<p>   A good place to start is by looking at the way a teacher exercisesintellectual authority in how she organizes a course. Do classes revolve aroundinformation passively acquired through lectures and textbooks? Is getting theright answer always the most important thing? Unless students are asked to sharein responsibility for their learning --to attain their own authority throughexploring ideas on their own --they will rely only on hierarchical andauthoritarian values, Essential schools believe. The best teachers are learnersthemselves, organizing their classes around questions whose answers remain opento continual investigation and debate. One of the curriculum's main goals thenbecomes that students learn respect for the opinions of others, and ways toevaluate them against other sources as they seek to form opinions of their own.<p>   These classroom decisions also develop skills that translate readily to non-academic areas of life. "In the classroom we can show kids that they mustlisten, must be reflective, must accept individual responsibility for their ownwords  and actions," says Bob McCarthy, CES's Director for schools. "Then thosehabits spill over into the hallways and the streets. When I was a principal mygoal was to teach kids to think before they act --to go to someone for dialogueand understanding before they retaliate."<p>   Once again, however, it is impossible to separate a school climate from itscontext. To get to the point where both pedagogy and personal interactionsreflect values of fairness and respect requires a sense of shared purpose andcommon cause among teachers, students, and administration that is rare in manyhigh schools. If a school district commonly issues classroom directives toteachers because their superiors "know better" what constitutes good educationalpractice, if faculty meetings are conducted in paternalistic or authoritarianfashion, if simple civilities such as providing coffee and soda for an after-school meeting are ignored, a school's atmosphere can become poisoned withbitterness and cynicism. It is not surprising when teachers in such situationschoose to shut their classroom doors and exercise through little tyrannies theonly power they are allowed to have. Students swiftly learn to manipulate thesystem to their own advantage, getting by somewhat as prison inmates do.<p>   In this sense, instituting Essential School pedagogies --question-based,cross-disciplinary, and challenging to conventional measures of success --canprove a key domino in changing a system that depends on a rigidly hierarchicalschool structure. Teachers and students who discover a new autonomy,interdependence. and respect in the classroom may bring those same habits to thefaculty meeting, the school board, and the voting booth. Indeed, the success ofrestructuring a school may depend ultimately on an atmosphere of mutual respect,where everyone is involved in articulating a new vision of what the school couldbe. If teachers, students, administration, and parents have gone through thatlong and painful process together, the school can step out of an atmosphere ofrepression and into a new ethos of trust.<p>   But such habits must receive continual reinforcement, Ted Sizer notes. "Youcan't have a vice-principal bellowing 'Shut up and siddown because I say so!' ina school based on empowerment and trust," he says. "And you can't base yourwhole assessment of students only on academic performance." During his own yearsas a high school principal, he notes, his staff used the term "in good standing"to appraise a student who demonstrated both in academics and in his or herbehavior towards peers and community the level of thoughtfulness the schoolexplicitly expected.<p><hr><h2>Fairness in Grading</h2><hr>A fair system of grading, in fact, is a critical and controversial factor inorganizing a school around standards of decency. What happens at grading time,for instance, to collaborative learning approaches in mixed-ability groupings?Are students to be graded on the basis of their effort or their abilities, onhow far they have come or how much they know and understand? Is a grading systemfairer and more decent if its function is to sort and select students, or if itsprimary aim is to encourage a student to keep on reaching towards intellectualgoals?<p>   Some schools address this issue by spelling out what objectives each studentis reaching for in a particular classroom endeavor. At Central Park EastSecondary School in New York, for example, students in mixed-ability groups makecontracts with the teacher to perform different tasks depending on whether theywant a grade of "Competent" or "Advanced." Yet every student, in every class, isexpected to learn to ask and answer these questions:<p><ul> <li>From whose viewpoint are we seeing or reading or hearing? From what angle     or perspective?<li>How do we know when we know? What's the evidence, and how reliable is it?<li>How are things, events, or people connected to each other? What is the     cause and what is the effect? How do they fit together?<li> What's new and what's old? Have we run across this idea before?<li>So what? Why does it matter? What does it all mean?</ul><p>   How a teacher uses tests also raises questions about fairness. For example,collaborating on tests has conventionally been regarded as cheating. But if thegoal is to enable a student to use and discuss information in society, theability to collaborate is a legitimate skill to test. In fact, many educatorscriticize conventional assessment techniques because they do not reflect whatgood schools want students to know and be able to do. Grant Wiggins, aresearcher who has written about exhibitions for the Coalition, describesinstead a theory of "authentic performance," which, he argues, could "test thosecapacities and habits we think are essential, and test them in context." Such aperformance, he writes in <i>Educational Leadership,</i><p><blockquote>   typically focuses on the essential skills of "inquiry and expression" --a   synthesis that requires questioning, problem posing, problems solving,   independent research, the creation of a product or performance, and a public   demonstration of mastery. Significantly, there is often a component calling   for self-reflection and analysis of what one has understood and learned.</blockquote><p>   The director of CES's exhibitions research project, Joseph McDonald, haswritten about one dilemma this raises for teachers: to balance a legitimate needto know where there are gaps in a student's knowledge with a faithfulness to the"authentic practice" of the domain being tested. He describes a young teacher inan Essential School struggling with this problem in an Earth Science class:<p><blockquote>   The problem concerned a meteorology unit. In her teaching, she had honored   the authentic practice of meteorology by requiring her students to work   together in the interpretation of data. But now it was time for her to find   out how much each of them had learned, so that she might know who still   needed to learn what." To conduct a traditional test, though, seemed to her   likely to pervert the authenticity of the unit, and even undercut what her   teaching had really taught. What could she do, she asked some older   colleagues.... She should assign a single set of data to several small   groups, they suggested, require each group to present a forecast drawn from   the data, and allow each group to hear all the other groups' forecasts. Then,   they continued, she should hand copies of all the reports to all the students   the next day, together with the following assignment: "These are the   forecasts your colleagues prepared based on the data available to them. What   they did not know, however, but which you now know, is that the winds have   shifted (or a cold front is coming, etc.).... Now, working individually with   all the data, old and new, and faced with cameras only 40 minutes from   rolling, create your own forecast."</blockquote><p>   A fair assessment, McDonald argues, addresses both "warm" and "cool" aspectsof performance; it both stays close to the actual practice of the discipline inreal life and maintains a certain "apartness" that allows intellectual gaps toshow up clearly. If instead grades are based on colder, less comprehensivecriteria, they end up meaning much less --they are less authentic. As Ted Sizerhas commented, in real life most of us know what is "on the exam," what we areexpected to know and do. Students notice this difference acutely, and itcontributes to their sense of fundamental hypocrisy about the ways they arejudged in the traditional school structure. Ultimately, this can result in achilling level of cynicism, which condones dishonest practices from gradeinflation to cheating as practical tools in achieving the stated goal of successin school: to land at the top of the competitive heap.<p><hr><h2>Making and Breaking Rules</h2><hr>How a school's rules are made and enforced is also a vital sign of itscommitment to decency. "Every good school has certain non-negotiable rules --anabsolute ban on violence is a good example, or an insistence on absolutehonesty," says Ted Sizer. "They are part of the contract students and teachersenter into when they join the school community." But once that fundamentalagreement has been undertaken, schools can become an important forum in which topractice the principles of democratic justice they want students to learn.<p>   Rochester's School Without Walls, for example, has adopted a simple andstraightforward democratic process by which any member of the school communitycan initiate a change in school rules (aside from those required by law). Almostall the rules, procedures, and guidelines in the school's student handbook weredeveloped and refined using that process. In addition, students and teachershave open to them a clearly defined appeals process with which to resolveanything from a student's attitude of uninvolvement to a teacher's evaluation ofstudent performance or an administrator's supervision of staff. "I refer to thestudent handbook constantly and base my decisions on it," says Dan Drmacich, theprogram administrator at School Without Walls.<p>   Some Essential schools have chosen a similar student governance system basedon psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg's notion of the "just community," whichfocuses on helping young people learn to make moral decisions. To createconditions in which every student can participate on an individual basis, thejust community relies on small advisory groups that discuss issues and delegatecertain students to carry out their decisions. The object is to resolveconflicts and disciplinary issues in a way that makes sure people come to termswith their emerging understanding of social justice and decency.<p>   How thoroughly this ethic of fairness can permeate a school's atmosphere canbe seen vividly at University Heights High School, an Essential school in theBronx whose 400 students and teachers take part in substantive issues anddecisions from school policies to disciplinary matters. A student FairnessCommittee meets weekly, for example, to listen to grievances brought by anymember of the school community. "You can't always pinpoint what's fair by makinga rule about it," says Shola Jiboyewa, a senior who sits on that committee."It's going to be different in different situations. What we have is a system ofresolving conflicts. We do it by listening to both sides. We tell our decisionto both people, and we impose some form of restitution --we don't see it aspunishment, because the goal is to make right what was wrong."<p>   In conversation with Shola and his fellow students, it becomes clear thatUniversity Heights' emphasis on participatory decision making is deeplyunderstood on a fundamental level. Students and teachers talk out issues inadvisory groups, staff meetings, and schoolwide assemblies until agreement canbe reached. A striking example of the dignity this accords them was played outat a routine afternoon policy meeting, which at least two dozen faculty members,students, parents, administrators, and district representatives chose to attend.One student complained of the new practice of inviting parents into the schoolfor periodic breakfasts with advisory groups. "I don't want my parents runninginto teachers in the hall and finding out every little time I don't do good," hesaid. It was a gripe that could easily have been brushed off, but instead itreceived a respectful hearing and serious discussion --by the end of which thestudent had come to see parent involvement as one way of moving toward the jobinternships for which he had also lobbied.<p>   Can such an approach work in a large public high school as well as it does insmaller schools? The person to ask in the Coalition is Judy Codding, a powerfuladvocate for the just community model who formerly headed tiny Bronxville HighSchool in suburban New York. Now she is principal of California's 2,200-studentPasadena High School, where she is struggling to apply the same standards ofparticipatory decision making to a radically different social and academicsituation. "To make it work in a big school like this involves totalrestructuring of the school into smaller learning units or houses, made up of300 to 400 students and ten or fifteen teachers," she says. "Then you can turnover all responsibility for noncurricular, non-personnel issues to theindividual house, which may pass its own rules and develop its own procedures."Ideally, she adds, representatives from each house could then meet in a largercongress whose role is to govern the entire school, coming to agreement oncertain schoolwide issues.<p>   Codding is cautious and pragmatic about instituting such an ambitiousgovernance system in a large city school plagued with serious problems already."I believe it can work," she says. "But it will take a long time. You're talkingabout considerable restructuring, and you'll need a good deal of staff trainingin working with advisory units." The same warning comes from CES's Paula Evans,who heads the Citibank faculty program. "This approach is not something a schoolcan just import wholesale," she says. "It's best to work first with otherteachers who have tried participatory democracy in their schools, in order toconsider the full range of dilemmas it presents."<p>   Whether or not the just community model she favors is used, Codding pointsout, in a thoughtful school the student government should focus primarily not onsocial events and functions but on issues of fairness and justice. "If you don'tdo that," she argues, "you teach students that governing themselves is primarilya matter of self-gratification --what pleases me, what will be the most fun."Some larger schools, especially those without a strong advisory group system,combine conventional student councils with a more broadly focused representativegovernance system. At Parkway South High School in suburban St. Louis, classofficers arrange school activities for the school's 2,000 students, but a largerelected body of up to 120 students sits in a General Assembly whose job is toraise and react to more substantive school issues, and several dozen morestudents sit on committees appointed by that group. Last year the Assemblycreated a student court, which now hears the kind of disciplinary cases usuallyresolved by assistant principals. At this point, says principal Craig Larson,perhaps 200 students in all are directly involved in their own governance. Toinvolve everyone, he agrees, would require restructuring the school into smallerunits, a prospect he says still worries many in the school community.<p>   Whatever way it works, a meaningful system of student government can go along way toward educating young people in the habits of responsible citizenship."Even in a school where students are given less responsibility in theclassroom," says CES's Bob McCarthy, "it provides a structure outside of theclassroom that encourages a climate of empowerment." But McCarthy believes it iseasier to create such student government structures if classroom practice hasalready taught students to take responsibility for their actions and respect theopinions of others. "Should it go step by step, or do we do things all at once?"he asks. "Ideally, one reinforces the other."<p><hr><h2>Recognition and Rituals</h2><hr>Taking public notice of student excellence --in both academics and other areassuch as community service --also fosters a culture of respect. Thayer HighSchool, an Essential school in Winchester, New Hampshire, has arranged discountsat local stores and public banquets for students who make the honor roll, arecurring and public benefit for doing well. And several smaller Essentialschools honor each student at graduation ceremonies by a very personal tributespoken by a teacher or adviser.<p>   Another way to underline a school's commitment to decent behavior is itswillingness to take strong symbolic steps when its standards are violated. TedSizer tells the story of a principal who called school to a complete halt oneday after a racial incident, initiating discussion groups and assembliesinstead. He was signaling the importance of the behavior just as clearly asthose schools do who cancel classes for mourning on the day a student dies.<p>   Community service projects also demonstrate an ethic of involvement andrespect that can pervade a school's culture. Central Park East Secondary Schoolsets aside a three-hour block each week for students to work in the community asteachers meet to plan. And at University Heights High School in the Bronx, the"family groups" that form the core of the school's advisory system go forth onceweekly to help out in nearby old age homes, elementary schools, and even collegeclasses for students of English as a second language. Marion Pearce, whocoordinates the program, is already expanding it into an afternoon seminarcalled "Future Teachers," in which students tutor elementary and junior highschool students on a daily basis. "It has a profound effect on their attitudes,"she says. "One of my students came back one day enraged; she had overheard akindergarten teacher say that a kid was dumb, within earshot of the child. Wetalked in class about the effects that has on a young child, and what we coulddo about it. One of the other students said that the same kind of thing hadhappened to him as a child; it had 'ruined seven years of my life,' he said."<p>                                        -   But is it a school's job to help students practice values like respect andthoughtfulness, and to meet their personal needs? Or should it stick strictly toacademics? The answer, of course, is complicated by the widely varying ways inwhich our culture defines what is decent behavior; what some call decent otherscall authoritarian, what some call respectful others call irreverent. The leastcontroversial path may be to keep one's nose in the textbooks, passing onreceived wisdom without asking how it might translate into social behavior. Butto see students wake up and start caring about themselves and others in aclimate like that at University Heights makes a powerful argument that a goodeducation extends to every aspect of a student's life. "You can't learn if youare hungry, homeless, emotionally lost," says one CES staff member. "You can'tlearn if you don't believe you have control over your own life, or if you don'trespect yourself." Parents bear the first responsibility for things like this,Ted Sizer adds. "But if they fail their children, the school cannot evade itsown part, however reluctant it may be to take these things on."<p>   In the end, thoughtful habits of mind show up equally in the classroom and inpersonal behavior, Sizer stresses again. "The principle of 'unanxiousexpectation' means, in part, being able to admit that you are wrong," he says."If a school has a secure climate, you can admit error in the halls as well asin physics class. You don't do that if you're afraid of sarcasm and punishment."In fact, the Essential School metaphor of teacher as coach may be extended toembrace the kind of behavior athletic coaches are known for demanding. A goodhigh school coach is often held up as a model of decency --the leader of a teamin which everyone has a personal part and a common goal. To stay on the team youabide by certain rules of behavior everyone accepts. And expectations are high;you're out there to do as well as you possibly can, to do credit to yourself andyour school.<p>   "Good schools connect these things," Ted Sizer says about the habits ofrespect that he would like to see cross academic and social lines in everyschool. "They often don't even know they are connecting them." In truth, aclimate of decency and respect is a pervasive but elusive thing, difficult topin to any one policy or program. It may arise from structures, but it showsitself in motion --a brief conversation between two teachers passing in thehalls, a parent who shows up to see his child perform before the class, astudent's triumphant smile as a group project comes to its finish, an older boyhuddled in council with a younger one. Because it cannot easily be quantified,the quality of decency is all too often ignored as we examine the strengths andweaknesses of schools. But inside schools, it cannot be ignored; decency is thevery blood of a system, whose weakness or vigor may well determine whether aschool will live or die. <p><hr><h2>                       A Model for Student Decision Making</h2><hr>Major school decisions are made by students and staff voting on proposals: oneperson, one vote. Some decisions must be made by the staff because of law,education policies of New York State and the city school district, and thespirit and philosophy of the school.<p>   The decision-making process was developed by the school community in 1976 inorder to ensure a more effective process that involved the maximum number ofstudents in decision making.<p>   The process is designed to help students in:<p><ol> <li> Defining problems and needs <li>Presenting their view of problems and/or proposed solutions <li> Refining rough draft proposals <li> Coming to a clear understanding of what finally is proposed <li> Voting in an informed and reasoned manner.</ol><p>For this process to work effectively all of the school community must beavailable at the same time. All extended classes must be in their rooms duringthe time allotted for the decision-making process, Friday mornings from 9:00 to12:00. Proposals may not be distributed after 10:00 a.m.<p><b>I. IDENTIFICATION OF NEED OR PROBLEM.</b> When an individual or group identifies anissue to be addressed (e.g., use of drugs or alcohol during school time, controlof student-raised money, improving the decision-making process), the problemshould be presented to his or her extended class during the Friday morning groupsession. After the group has clearly defined the problem or has developed aproposal to meet these needs, it can present its concerns to the school body.<p><b>II. COMMUNICATING WITH THE SCHOOL BODY. </b>The group sends representatives to eachextended class: to point out the needs or problem requiring attention and to getthe feelings of the other groups about the concern, or to present to them adraft proposal for reaction and/or amendment, if necessary.<p><b>III. REFINING OF FINAL PROPOSAL. </b>The group's representatives then return totheir own group to report the concerns or feelings of the rest of the schoolbody. This combined information can then be used to write the final proposal tobe presented to the school body for decision. The final draft of the proposalshould be checked with the program administrator to see if it has dealtcompletely with the issue and that it has been drafted in the appropriate form.<p><b>IV. PRESENTATION OF FINAL PROPOSAL FOR A VOTE.</b> Copies of final drafts ofproposals are to be sent to other extended classes for final discussion andvote. (The original copy of the proposal must be sent to the office for filing.)It is suggested that the representatives of the presenting group go with theproposal in order to explain or answer questions.<p><b>V. TALLYING OF THE VOTE.</b> All extended classes report their vote to the schooloffice where the tally will be made. Decisions are made on the basis of thegrand total of the individual votes. This process can take as little as one day.However, complex problems or proposals may take longer.<p><b>VI. OTHER OPTIONS FOR IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS AND EXPLAINING PROPOSALS. </b>Since allgroups meet at the same time for the same purpose, it is possible for:<p><ol><li> People from two or more extended classes to form a problem-solving group to   identify a problem or write a proposal.<li> Two or more groups to meet together, when both agree to, to share concerns   and feelings.<li>A group to request a whole school meeting, which will be held if and when all   groups agree to it. No extended class or problem-solving group has the right   to demand of other groups that they stop doing what they are doing in order   to listen to those who call the meeting. They may ask the other groups to   come together to identify a concern or explain a proposal.</ol><p>From the 1988-89 student handbook of School Without Walls, 480 Broadway,Rochester, NY 14607. (Tel: 716-546-6732.)<p><hr>                  <h2> The Essential Schools' 7th Common Principle</h2><hr>The tone of the school should explicitly and self-consciously stress values ofunanxious expectation (I won't threaten you but I expect much of you), of trust(until abused), and of decency (the values of fairness, generosity, andtolerance). Incentives appropriate to the school's particular students andteachers should be emphasized, and parents should be treated as essentialcollaborators.<p><hr>                             <h2> Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or comingeditions.

<html><head><title>CES: Publications: Horace: 5-4: Scheduling the Essential School</title></head><body><hr><h1><center>Scheduling the Essential School</center></h1><center>Volume 5, Number 4<BR> May 1989</center><hr>                                     Imagine you have a week to accomplish a series of specific tasks, Bob McCarthylikes to say to the people who come to the scheduling workshops at the Coalitionof Essential Schools, where he is Director for Schools. You're going to read <i>Zenand the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> and discuss it with a few friends; you'regoing to repair the front steps; you're going to write a long letter to a friendyou haven't seen in years; you have a few other projects large and small. Howwould you organize your week so as to get all these different things done?<p>   Chances are, workshop participants tend to agree, the least useful way tostart would be to divide up your days into 45-minute blocks, moving at rigidintervals from one task to the next. Yet precisely in this way do most Americanhigh schools schedule the learning tasks they set for students. Few students getthe chance to work for sustained periods during the day on one project; few caneasily call for help on more than one expert in a particular time period. Inshort, if you decide to use the high school as a model for your week, the bookdiscussion may have to break up just when it is getting going, and the frontsteps may languish till they rot.<p>   "I know of no other organization in the world that has duplicated the highschool schedule as a way of organizing learning," says McCarthy. Amazingly,though, the standard schedule is one of the few aspects of American educationthat has remained virtually unchanged in the last century. Despite the "flexiblemodular scheduling" trend of the 1960s, most high schools today still operate onsome variation of the six- or seven-period day, with classes around 45 minuteslong. And even for those of us long past our school years, the schedulecontinues to wield an almost unnatural power over how we set up learningsituations. Few people cannot recall in precise detail the way they moved fromclass to class during their senior year in school, McCarthy asserts--and manywill merely replicate it if asked to design a school schedule on their own.<p>   But does such a way of organizing school time actually help students learn touse their minds well, and teachers to teach? Do all subjects require the sameamount of time every day, and must they have it all to themselves? An increasingnumber of Coalition schools are saying no; and their efforts to change theirschedules reveal much about how deeply a school's organization of time isconnected with its assumptions about how learning occurs. "Schools equal theirschedules," says one Coalition principal emphatically; yet the schedule is oftenthe hardest thing in education to change.<p>   To explore the scheduling issue we spoke with schools at the beginning ofthis process and those who have long discarded traditional schedule models,schools that teach a stripped-down core curriculum and those offering a varietyof courses as wide as most junior colleges. For each of these disparate schools,however, one thing held true: changes in their schedules invariably were drivenby their commitment to principles of learning that simply could not beaccommodated by the old time slots. This progression from pedagogy to schedulechange is critical if the change is to work, says Amy Gerstein, who as AssistantDirector for Schools leads many of the scheduling workshops the Coalition offersat regional symposia. When schedule changes are not driven by educationalprinciples, they risk becoming just another educational fad. The best schedulesmay actually change continually, in response to the evolving vision of aparticular school.<p>   One of the most common such changes is to introduce some form of flexibilitythat allows teachers to work in greater depth with their students. It has longbeen acknowledged that science labs require extended periods to accomplish theiraims, but as teachers in other disciplines put the principle of "student asworker" into practice, they often find themselves equally frustrated by shortperiods. Seminars that encourage students to exercise their own criticalthinking skills in a new area, serious projects in the library or community,work in small groups at different levels with the teacher in a coaching role--allthese require more than 40 minutes at a time to achieve. Being forced to fit athoughtful and innovative curriculum into a "container" that cannot accommodateit has led many teachers to ask for scheduling change.<p>   Inevitably, however, any one change has ripple effects throughout theschool's schedule. Coordinating course offerings that include requirements andelectives is already complex enough; when schools undertake to lengthen someclass periods, certain kinds of classic scheduling problems become acute. Howthese problems crop up--and the resources of time, teachers, and space availableto deal with them--varies according to the size of the school. In a large school,where many courses meet in multiple sections at various hours, a student whospends all morning in a lengthened humanities class will still have a chance totake that economics elective in the afternoon. But if there is only oneeconomics section, and it meets in the morning, that extended block ofhumanitiestime precludes any other choices.<p>   Partly because of conflicts like this, with small elective courses that meetonly once daily ("singletons"), many Essential schools have started with aschool-within-a-school that depends on the larger school to provide for allelectives. Here a small percentage of the student body follows a differentschedule from the other students', often consisting of two extended time blocksin the morning, which may or may not be used for interdisciplinary classes. Inthe afternoon, most commonly, such students rejoin their peers for certainelective courses.<p>   Figure I illustrates a sample student's day using such a schedule. In thisschool a team of four teachers is responsible for a group of 80 to 100 ninthgraders, whom they instruct in science, math, history, and English in groups of20 to 25 students at a time. Classes meet for an hour and 40 minutes, onalternate days--three times one week, twice the next. This student, for example,has science three times this week; next week she will have math three times andscience only twice. Teachers also meet for a weekly common planning period ofthe same length. After lunch, there is time for study hall or physicaleducation, and the student rejoins the larger student body for one 48-minuteelective period.<p>   Clearly, the schedule reflects definite priorities: a smaller student loadfor teachers; the personalization that results from one team sharing the samestudents; more extended time for academic subjects. But students must compromiseby having less choice of electives; and some teachers think only seeing astudent in class two or three times a week is a compromise as well. TheCoalition's Susan Lusi points out that all schedules are built on suchpriorities and compromises, whether examined or not; the question schools mustface is whether the existing schedule in fact reflects their educationalphilosophy.<p>   But if that philosophy commits the school to teacher-student personalization,in-depth mastery of a limited number of areas, student-as-worker, or a number ofother common Coalition principles, CES argues that a school-within-a-schoolstructure is ultimately not enough. If it is to work, curricular and pedagogicalreform must be embraced by the whole staff, not be regarded as just an"enrichment program" involving a few longer classes. Moreover, the lengthenedclass periods and extra time--for preparation, support, and development--enjoyedby school-within-a-school teachers has caused divisiveness at many Essentialschools.<p><hr><h2>One Solution: Strip Electives</h2><hr>For some, the only answer is to move unequivocally to a stripped-down curriculumreflecting their highest priority, Ted Sizer's dictum that "Less is more." Sucha plan eliminates altogether the courses that cause schedule conflicts, andmakes a shift to a 1:80 teacher-student load far simpler as well. Course contentthat conventionally would be covered in elective classes --music, art, orcalculus, for instance--can be incorporated into interdisciplinary offerings insuch a schema, or otherwise arranged as teaching becomes more personalized.<p>   The barest of such schedules is that of New York City's Central Park EastSecondary School (shown in Figure II). Here all teachers are teaching at once,and they are all off at once too, to facilitate common planning time. Two-hourinterdisciplinary classes meet in the morning and the afternoon, and a student-teacher advisory period is scheduled four days a week. One morning a week, allstudents go into the community for service projects, while teachers meet to makeplans together. Spanish is the only language offered, for one hour before schoolfour days a week; and any other electives take place in the two hours afterschool is officially over.<p>   The plan appears to work admirably at Central Park East, a 500-student urbanschool with a student body reflecting the heterogeneous city population. Butthat school was created as an Essential school from its first day. Itsphilosophy  was clear from the start. And no teachers were displaced to make itsunusual schedule possible. Few of the Coalition's 57 member schools have offeredsuch a stark testing of the "Less is more" slogan.<p>   The curriculum of Adelphi Academy, a Brooklyn, New York college preparatoryschool for sixth through twelfth graders, also comprises only the core subjects,focusing each year on a central theme. (Art and music and a modern language areconsidered part of the core; students choose between French and Spanish.) Here,the move towards a new schedule with longer time blocks was a direct result ofan ongoing shift in the school's teaching philosophy over a period of severalyears. In the English and history departments, according to Adelphi teacher PhilStone, teachers were moving towards more analysis and critical thinking in aseminar context. To suit this, they designed a system of double-period seminarsin each subject twice weekly, in combination with shorter lessons on alternatedays.<p>   "But since the seminar would meet on Monday and Wednesday, or on Tuesday andThursday," Stone says, "practically a whole week would go by without contact inthe seminar context. The break disrupted the flow, and it didn't foster the kindof thinking for which the seminars were designed." To solve the problem, the twodepartments combined to teach an interdisciplinary English and historycurriculum--based on critical thinking goals, and the seminar as a way ofteaching them.<p>   After continual fine-tuning, Adelphi's schedule now works as shown in FigureIII, a tenth-grader's schedule for the week. An eight-period day is the basis,but 45-minute "lessons," or lectures, take up only about a third of thestudent's time; most classes are 90-minute interdisciplinary seminars in eitherEnglish and history or math and science. The foreign language, perhaps, isshortchanged; it gets only one 90-minute block and two 45-minute periods in theweek, and students can't take two languages because they both meet at once.(Stone notes that the humanities program does try to coordinate its plans withforeign languages, particularly at more advanced language levels.) Wherestudents have options--for example, a choice between two science classes--theseare scheduled in the same time block, so no conflict can occur between scienceand the humanities. In addition, the schedule accommodates a few curricularanomalies: at least one "dialogue" or guidance period weekly for each student; aperiod where everyone in the school, including the faculty and headmaster, dropseverything and reads for pleasure; and a Great Books weekly seminar. Two days aweek, a ninth period is added at the end of the day.<p><hr><h2>How Much Less Is More?</h2><hr>Adelphi has shaped its curriculum expressly towards preparing students forcollege-level work; and it can defend its "less is more" philosophy on thosegrounds. But for schools that say vocational electives form an important part ofa curriculum that serves a broader range of students, Adelphi's compromise onelectives would be unacceptable. For others, stripping the curriculum of mostelectives would involve an intolerable or unworkable degree of teacher layoffsor transfers. And still others--often high-achieving suburban schools wherevirtually all students go on to college--are firmly committed to offering thevariety in advanced or elective courses that they see as an integral part oftheir top reputation. These schools see little reason to change a system that iswidely recognized as successful according to all standard measures of academicsuccess.<p>   For such schools, wrestling with the pedagogical issues the Coalition raisesis often a matter of asking just how much less is how much more. And even thisquestion can be answered several ways, depending on whether the primary concernis the politics of change within a school or the actual content and schedulingof specific courses. A school committed to the kind of "bottom-up" reform theCoalition advocates, which is supported and initiated by the teachersthemselves, may choose to move only cautiously towards schedule changes.Advocates for change in this kind of environment will face more than simpleresentment of a new program that may challenge someone's turf; they must somehowalter long-standing assumptions about what educational success is.<p>   The more mechanical aspect of scheduling changes--one that raises hairs on thenecks of both experts and greenhorns in scheduling--is another matter entirely.Schedules are made in all manner of ways, it seems, from computers to late-nightcommittees with chalk in their hair. And they are made by all manner of people,from math teachers, guidance counselors, and administrative assistants toprincipals and district superintendents. The intimidating and arcane nature ofthe task is such that few students, teachers, or parents dare challenge "Theschedule can't handle it" as an answer to a curricular suggestion or complaint.<p>   Perhaps no one in the Coalition knows the ins and outs of computer schedulingmore intimately than Jim Sexton, the director of secondary schools inLouisville, Kentucky, where he supervises the scheduling of the six Coalitionschools in his district. Sexton firmly believes that the only way to achieve thepersonalization he calls fundamental to an Essential school's success is by"block scheduling" of extended periods. "The only way to get to 1:80," he says,"is to get teachers to see the same group of kids for more than one period aday."<p><hr><h2>Schedule Singletons First</h2><hr>But block scheduling causes some singleton shock waves, Sexton readilyacknowledges, especially when courses are scheduled by computer. "Avoidingconflicts is actually easier to do when you schedule by hand," he says. "But allstudent information is kept in the computer, so we have to start there."<p>   Sexton's scheduling technique is to start with the singleton courses thatcause all the trouble, and then work upwards from there. "Singletons dictate alarge portion of the overall look of a school," he says. Working from a surveyoutlining student demand for a particular course, the school principal candetermine just how many sections of the course are required, and a masterschedule is devised. "The hardest part of the master schedule," Sexton warns,"is making sure you don't have a large number of students who want to take asingleton like calculus conflicting with another singleton like chorus."<p>   To minimize the number of problems, Sexton does a preliminary "plateau run"of the master schedule on the computer, which turns up scheduling conflicts. Iffewer than 50 conflicts occur, he says, the schedule will work, and the problemcases get worked out by hand and then plugged back into the computer. "You haveto sit down with students and see what choices they might have to make," hesays. "You really don't want to make a kid have to choose between a humanitiescourse and band or chorus."<p>   The key to avoiding such conflicts, Sexton says, is not to schedule anycourse offerings with 30 or fewer students at the same grade level at the sametime. Because required courses usually have more than one section, a studentthen need not choose between two desired singletons. But small schools oftenhave fewer sections for required courses, Sexton notes, making singleton clashesinevitable. Also, in small schools certain advanced or remedial courses withunusually few students may necessarily "bump up" the number of students assignedto basic, required course sections, an obviously undesirable effect.<p><hr><h2>Back-To-Back Scheduling</h2><hr>So far, then, we have examined two ways of coping with scheduling in theEssential School: stripping down the curriculum to eliminate singletons andelectives, and scheduling such courses before and after extended blocks of timein the schedule. Another possibility, however, is simply to schedule certainclasses at the same grade level back to back at the teachers' request. Thisallows individual teachers to work together in teams if they want to, butpreserves the convention of shorter periods and the priority of numerouselectives. Some teachers find this a useful way to trade time with others toaccommodate longer projects and field trips; others use it as a way to ease intointerdisciplinary teaching.<p>   At Bronxville High School, a small public school in a wealthy suburb of NewYork,  ninth-grade history and English are scheduled back to back for one groupand taught in teams. Bronxville's is an eight-day rotating schedule with seven47-minute periods per day. One class drops out every eight days, so thatstudents can take eight courses, a high priority in this college-bound studentpopulation with a strong interest in electives. Electives can meet every otherday in the eight-day cycle.<p>   A major component of Bronxville's Essential School program, then, is theeffort to provide an interdisciplinary course in history, English, and art,which takes place during back-to-back history and English periods. "Because ofthe community we're in, we haven't gone to either a school-within-a-school orschool-wide conversion to Coalition form," says its coordinator, Joanne Duffy,who teaches the interdisciplinary course. But the school is moving, in responseto community interest, towards more flexible and interdisciplinary approacheswithin its eight-day schedule. Primary among these is the setting aside of threeperiods in the schedule cycle for grade-wide "seminars," which incorporateenrichment material and group discussions. The remaining four periods in thecycle are used for physical education and other less frequently scheduledclasses. Interestingly, it took 99 computer runs to get Bronxville's schedule towork this way, and when it did finally work, it was by scheduling the longblocks first, using a flexible modular system.<p><hr><h2>Schools Within Schools</h2><hr>Lincoln High School in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, with a seven-period day of 55-minute classes, schedules its first four periods of every day in suchinterdisciplinary blocks for the 40 students in its school-within-a-schoolEssential program. The teachers are very free to trade off time betweensubjects, says Kristin Urban, an English teacher in the program, and theystructure each day's work together as they see fit. Problems have arisen,though, because certain advanced electives, particularly in science andlanguages, are offered only in the morning--a situation exacerbated by the factthat many Manitowoc language teachers travel from school to school.<p>   In fact, unless a school is willing to build its schedule by working up,Sexton-style, from singleton courses, it seems inevitable that such a conflictwill threaten any program that wants longer periods to accommodate a change inpedagogy. This underlines the need for the integration of the whole school intoa Coalition effort if it is to succeed.<p>   But structuring the Essential School as a school-within-a-school, where corecourses are block scheduled and electives take place only outside the "program,"can work an entirely different way, as at Rochester's School Without Walls, asmall city magnet school started in the late 1960s. The heart of this unusualprogram is an interdisciplinary curriculum known as "extended classes," whichoccupies students for two and a half hours four mornings a week. Because theschool's teaching philosophy is that learning has no "walls"--between subjects,grade levels, abilities, the school and the community, and books and experience--it makes extensive use of the resources of the community at large. In animportant way, it can be seen as a school within a larger "school," which is thecommunity itself.<p>   In the periods directly before and after this central extended period, SchoolWithout Walls students meet for other classes in remedial, elective, or advancedsubjects. In many cases, particularly with advanced students, they go elsewherefor these classes--to another city high school or college. In other cases,community professionals come in to teach special subjects; or students doindependent study with a certified teacher. The staff meets for common planningtime during one extended class period weekly, but there is little actual teamteaching in the conventional sense.<p>   In the end, this unusual school is an example of just how far one can changea schedule when pedagogy is allowed to dictate the organization of time and thewhole staff is firmly behind it. Though the school is quite small, scheduleconflicts are actually rare at School Without Walls, program administrator DanDrmacich says, because the schedule is designed to honor diversity as one of itsstrongest priorities. The extended classes are designed so that the structuredoes not dictate what the students do, but rather the students determine whatthe structure can do for them.<p><hr><h2>Pedagogy Before Schedule</h2><hr>How, then, can a school alter its schedule to accommodate changing pedagogywithout stepping on the toes of teachers who are not involved in the EssentialSchool program? One answer is clearly to work for whole-school commitment topedagogical change--so more teachers will see gain rather than loss in changeslike longer periods. At Parkway South High School in Manchester, Missouri, forexample, principal Craig Larson has moved away altogether from regardingEssential School principles as anything "special" or "different" within his2,000-student school. Instead, the whole faculty is invited to discuss ways toput into practice personalization of their classes,student-as-worker theories, andexhibitions of mastery. And any teacher who wants to explore new ways of doingthis is encouraged to ask for scheduling support.<p>   The result is that 46 teachers have already expressed interest in teachingmore intensively in longer time blocks next year--up from the eleven who wereinvolved in Parkway South's pilot school-within-a-school framework. They includeteachers in foreign languages, music, and the arts; and although no particularstress is placed on interdisciplinary classes, natural connections areencouraged to grow. One Spanish teacher, for example, came to Larson with newsof a school in Chicago that combines social studies, English, and foreignlanguage curriculum. She has been funded to visit the school, and on her returnwill help form such a team with other interested teachers, possibly adding aphysical science teacher as well. The team will have a four-hour daily block towork with a group of 75 to 100 students, plus daily tutorial time. Larson ishoping that the new use of time will have a positive effect on improving theoral skills of language students.<p>   Larson gives a crazed laugh when he is asked to describe how he will schedulethe school next year to make possible such widespread involvement with changingpedagogy. He has been using a mainframe computer program called Socrates todesign his master schedule, but says he will combine it next year with havingstudents come in and sign up for classes. Right now, one way Parkway Southbuilds flexibility into its master schedule of six 54-minute periods is byadding a before-school "zero hour" class from 7:15 to 8:10 a.m. Around 15percent of the students arrive on an early bus to take anextra elective course that mightotherwise cause a conflict.<p>   Clearly Larson's scheduling approach does not lend itself to simpledescription, however. He is a master adjuster, constantly revising his schedulein response to suggestions as teachers' and students' needs change. But ParkwaySouth is a good example of what can be done when a Coalition school is unwillingto strip down its elective curriculum as Horace's Compromise suggests--yet isfirmly committed to the other pedagogical aims of the Essential Schoolsmovement. Teacher resistance is no longer the problem it was during the initialschool-within-a-school years, says Patrick Conley, the project coordinator.Teaching and learning are being discussed in new terms by an increasing numberof people in the school community. And however stubborn the schedule may seem,it is viewed as a tool and not a tyrant, capable of putting into place thechanges that people choose.<p>                                         There may have been a time when a schedule could be made by dividing up theday into equal blocks, punctuated by breaks long enough for a principal to walkthe length of the school backwards, as one student legend has it. But Coalitionpedagogy clearly has begun to disrupt that pattern in ways too fundamental to beignored. How resistant a school is to the necessary next step--seriousrescheduling of the entire school--may depend in the long run on how serious itis about the common principles on which the Coalition rests. <p><hr><h2>Figure One</h2><hr>                                    <table>          <th><b>Monday   |    Tuesday     |  Wednesday   |    Thursday     | Friday</b></th><p><tr>8:30-8:49    <td>H.R.    </td>  |   <td>H.R.</td>       |<td>    H.R. </td>        |    <td>H.R.  </td>|    <td>     H.R.</td></tr><p><tr>8:53-9:41    Science      | Math    |       Science          |Math |          Science</tr><p>             <tr>9:45-10:33  [Science or Math classes continue]	</tr>	<p><tr>10:37-11:25  History  |     English       | History        |  English    |    History</tr><p><tr>11:29-12:16   [History or English classes continue]</tr><p> <tr>12:16-12:46  Lunch       |  Lunch       |   Lunch        |    Lunch |        Lunch</tr><p><tr>12:50-1:30   Study       |  Phys.

In the largecomprehensive schools where I had worked before, I saw the classroomand the library as separate, and the library was not terribly useful.Now I see the library as a wing of the classroom. Kids work there,get information and books. It is a resource for them that they feelownership of. It is also a place where kids can work on computers,Xerox a page if needed, or get help from the adults and other kids.Our library is "user friendly" and intensely used."<p>        -Pat Walter, Humanities Teacher<br>        Central Park East Secondary School<p>        Few schools have had Central Park East Secondary School's(CPESS) opportunity to create itself from scratch -- a truly "breakthe mold" plan for a secondary school.1 From the beginning, it wasdecided that the library would play a principal role. This paper isconcerned with three concepts:<p><ol><li>Why CPESS saw the library differently from the way it is perceivedin many traditional high schools<li>How good school libraries intraditional schools are living examples of the Coalition of Essentialschool's nine Common Principles in practice <li>How the CPESSlibrary enables students to do the kinds of work characteristic of anEssential school.</ol><p><hr><h2>Central Park East Secondary School</h2><hr>        In the planning of CPESS, we envisioned a school that would offerchildren the opportunity to take control of their own education.CPESS would not focus on content coverage in its curriculum. Thelecture would be largely abandoned, reserved for the specialinstances when it would be the most effective way to presentinformation. Instead, teachers would pose challenging problemsrelevant to the students' own experience. They would introduce anddemonstrate to students the various "tools" students could use and"coach" them as they produced exhibitions demonstrating their masteryof the necessary skills and knowledge. It seemed axiomatic that thelibrary would have to be a key component of the school.<p>        This approach to schooling offers the real possibility ofengaging students. There is a much greater chance that they will careabout what they are working on. Moreover, this kind of work does notlend itself to a reliance on textbooks to drive the curriculum, amatter of great importance for the library. Textbooks are oneresource among many; most of these sources of information, in bothelectronic and print media, are located in, or are associated with,the library. Students spend an enormous amount of time in the libraryat CPESS.<p>        The results of this approach to teaching, and our integration ofclassroom and library, have been noteworthy: Students know how tolearn; how to solve problems; and how to engage the adult world withconfidence in their own abilities. We have been told by collegeswhere our graduates have been admitted that our students approachtheir college experience differently from most new undergraduates.Among the qualities observed is an expectation that the educatorswill assist students with whatever needs they may have. They approachcollege classes, even the large lecture sections that are unknown atCPESS, as just another learning problem to be solved. They form studygroups as a matter of course. It's not that they are smarter thanother students or know more; they simply have a better idea about howthey learn, and believe they are entitled to create the conditionsthat will make it possible.2<p>        The planning team for CPESS and its library considered how tocreate a school in which students could develop powerful "habits ofmind"3 and use them to take control of their learning process. Wewere influenced deeply by the work of the Coalition of EssentialSchools, especially the thinking embodied in the nine CommonPrinciples that resulted from Ted Sizer's study of secondary schoolsconducted in the early 1980s and published in Horace's Compromise.4The nine Common Principles challenged us: since all schoolinginvolves compromises, why not favor students actively learning to usetheir minds well, rather than favoring the bell schedule, theathletic teams, the multiplicity of electives, and the perceivedlockstep requirements for college admission?<p>        The Coalition of Essential Schools does not prescribe a rigidlyformulated template for reformed schools. Its approach is toencourage schools to recreate themselves according to their ownideas, strengths, and characteristics. It does, however, present theCommon Principles as a framework for fundamental school change. In myview, all nine principles need to be seen as interconnected and partof a whole. They are designed to encompass schoolwide change and notsimply to change classroom practice in isolation. While theirapplication varies from one school to another -- and no school is aperfect model -- each is a demonstration that real school change ispossible. The educational concepts embodied in the ideas "student asworker" and "less is more" really can work to produce excellentschools in all kinds of settings.<p>        Despite the variety of forms Essential schools take, no schooloperating in harmony with the nine Common Principles can do sowithout having at its core a newly defined vision of the library. Thelibrary, and the role of the librarian, must be seen as indivisiblefrom the idea of an Essential school.<p><hr><h2>The Library at CPESS</h2><hr>        As librarian, I was among the first of the staff hired to bepart of the planning team of CPESS. We all played dual roles as"generalists" and as "specialists." I played the role of generalistby being concerned with the total learning program and design of theschool, and specialist as librarian, concerned with creation anddevelopment of the school's library and information resources. Ourshared challenge was to imagine a transformed library, one that wouldmeet the needs of the school we were creating.<p>        Along with the familiar, enjoyable tasks of planning,purchasing, and organizing, the challenge had two aspects. First itwas clear that we needed to redesign and reconfigure the physicalplant of the site's existing library to house the expanded number ofbooks and other resources. The library we inherited was originallyintended to meet the needs of a junior high school built in 1958. Itwas approximately two and a half classrooms in size and had a smalloffice. We needed to double the floor space and triple the shelfspace. We needed to have tables that could accommodate computers andother hardware. We needed many more electrical outlets and, ofcourse, we needed books and software. I decided that the officeshould not be at the extreme end of the library, but an island in itscenter, with large windows offering a sweeping view of the entirespace and easy communication with users. Walls needed to come down,and architects to be consulted and persuaded that this library wasfor a different kind of school, one in which much more activelearning would take place.<p>        There were many arguments -- over furniture (the architectswanted plastic, I wanted comfortable, sturdy wood), over the numberof outlets (I wanted twice as many as they deemed normal), overbookcases (How many and how tall?!). We had to compromise, a lot. Wewere prevented from removing one wall because of fire regulations, sothere is one room of the library across a corridor housing importantparts of our book collection. Someday, our plan may be realized andthe corridor walls dismantled to create the large uninterrupted spacethat will make the library a much more open and agreeable space.<p>        The second aspect was more difficult: to change the thinking ofeveryone on the staff about the library, starting with me, thelibrarian. All of us had come from existing schools and had toovercome biases that had developed over the years. While reexaminingideas about the way we worked in the classroom, we reconsidered thelibrary as well. In many ways we were redefining the meaning of thebasic elements of schooling -- classroom, teacher, and library -- andhow they would work together. What did we really want? The process ofrestructuring a school and the process of restructuring its libraryare intimately connected and intertwined.<p>        School librarians have always tried to provide excellent serviceto all their "clients" in all settings. Unfortunately, in most publichigh schools, middle schools, and elementary schools, librarians aregiven a structure to work within that promotes the least effectiveuse of the library as a resource for thoughtful inquiry.5 Ted Sizerhas written at length of the frustrating compromises teachers face incomprehensive high schools.6 For librarians, it is the same. Manylibrarians are prepcoverage teachers, substitute teachers, or readingteachers. The library is too often seen as a room that must be"programmed," a slot to be filled. In some situations, libraries areused as surrogate study halls, sometimes under the disingenuousmisnomer of "study skills" classes. Even under the most privileged ofcircumstances, when school libraries become showplaces of high-techinformation wizardry, they are isolated in the departmentalizedstructure of the comprehensive school -- something extra, perhapselegant, but certainly not essential. In the worst of circumstances,libraries, or more usually librarians, are deleted in budget crises --another of the awful compromises needed to "keep things going."<p><hr><h2>The Nine Common Principles and the Library</h2><hr>        Ideas from two sources converged to reinforce the CPESS planningteam's conclusion about the library's importance. One set of ideas isderived from the nine Common Principles, and the second from thelibrary profession's traditional vision of the secondary schoollibrary.7 This section will focus on the nine Common Principlesthrough the eyes of a librarian, speaking as a generalist and as aspecialist. It will examine each principle in turn, exploring theimplications for the school as a whole and for libraries and theirlibrarians within restructured schools.<p><b>Principle 1- The school should focus on helping adolescents to learnto use their minds well. Schools should not attempt to be"comprehensive" if such a claim is made at the expense of theschool's central intellectual purpose.</b><p>        What does "using one's mind well" mean? Although the student whotemporarily memorizes what a teacher or textbook says, and accuratelyparrots it back on an exam, still earns an "A" in many high schoolcourses, at CPESS we believe this is not enough. To use their mindswell, students must cultivate certain "habits of mind"8 they canapply in everything they do. Habits of mind help thinking peopleevaluate and decide what is pertinent and what is irrelevant, whatconnects ideas one to another, and what point of view is beingreflected.<p>        Children are not born with these habits of mind alreadyinstalled, like ROM in a computer. The habits must be learned andpracticed. Developing good habits of mind means developing theability to evaluate information -- the opposite of passive acceptance.Comparing an idea with common sense can be useful, but what is reallyneeded is a range of information sources reflecting various points ofview.<p>        Without a richness of information, how can a student practiceand develop confidence in using these new habits of mind? Classroomactivity can help to focus students to understand the habits of mindand how to use them. No classroom, however, can by itself provideenough information to support a student's individual inquiry. But thelibrary can.<p>        In an Essential school, the library should have a largecollection of resources that are well organized and easy to access.The book collection is still the essential core of the library.Designing the book collection of a school like CPESS is particularlyinteresting. Resources and shelf space are limited, so decisions haveto be made on which areas to build up in depth and in which toprovide just a few basic items. These decisions follow closely thedecisions made by the staff about curriculum -- thus, the librarianmust be in on these discussions.<p>        There needs to be real depth in certain subject categories, lessin others, if students are to be able to find a variety of resourceson the topics they are likely to be exploring. Because so muchcurrent information is available in periodicals, we subscribed toabout a 100, including most of those indexed in the Abridged Readers'Guide to Periodical Literature. It was wonderful to see the shelvesfill up with beautiful new books.<p>        But today it is no longer enough to provide an excellent bookand periodical collection. There is a powerful trend toward makinginformation available through electronic means.9 This is something wemust advocate for our students. People who don't know how to accessinformation in this way are increasingly at a disadvantage. Despitethe limited financial means at our disposal, we decided early atCPESS to open this electronic world to our students. We decided thatthe library must be a multimedia resource, where video and computingare widely available. Students and staff are taught how to access on-line databases that will provide them with the information they need.A basic collection of tool software is maintained in the library, andinstant training is available to all comers. As I discuss later,students can help make this possible.<p>        It is important to note that current libraries in many schoolsare already structured to encourage and support the application ofthe higher order thinking skills invoked by the "habits of mind."Reference books and computer-based information services, maps andatlases, periodicals and pamphlet files housed in school libraries,all enable students to cite evidence for their position on an issue,see meaningful connections between ideas, or identify an author's ororganization's point of view. The library is where the school'scentral focus of encouraging students to use their minds well can andought to be played out most fully.<p><b>Principle 2 - The school's goals should be simple: that each studentmaster a limited number of essential skills and areas of knowledge. .. . The program's design should be shaped by the intellectual andimaginative powers and competencies that students need, rather thannecessarily by "subjects." . . . The aphorism "Less Is More" shoulddominate: Curricular decisions should be guided by the aim ofthorough student mastery and achievement rather than by the effortmerely to cover content.</b><p>        This is the "less is more" principle. It is based on a beliefabout the way people learn. When people are asked to describe theirown most powerful learning experiences, often there are manycharacteristics in common: they are stimulated by a problem that hasbeen posed in the learner's own life. The time available for work onthe problem is not strictly limited. The learning activity may notuncover a "right answer" but still may be deeply satisfying becauseit permits the learner to reflect deeply on the issues associatedwith the problem. The learner doesn't hesitate to learn how to useany resource that may advance the work. The learner will usually behappy to find people more expert who will collaborate or provideinsights. The result of these learning experiences is transformative:it changes people's lives.<p>        Comprehensive high schools find it difficult to createenvironments that stimulate these powerful learning experiences forstudents. There seem to be many constraints -- credentials, tradition,perks, and the schedule all feel like impossible barriers in manyschools. Can teachers, administrators, and other stakeholders, inorder to create an environment for active learning, agree on arigorous core of skills and competencies that students must master?What might need to be given up? Can we allow students to graduatesimply on the basis of demonstrated mastery of these skills andcompetencies? Will they get into college? The Coalition of EssentialSchools argues that schools must stop trying to be "comprehensive" ifthere is to be any fundamental change in the quality of high schools.<p>        To accomplish this change, the curriculum must be simplified andthe "subjects" integrated to form a natural whole. This is the "less"part. Integration of the curriculum permits the scheduling of largeblocks of time allowing students to engage in active learning -- the"more" part. The notions of "coverage" and "units," as they arecurrently understood, are given up in order to focus on thinking andanalyzing, on problem solving.<p>        Once these principles are really adopted by a school, teachers'and librarians' roles change. No longer responsible for presenting atraditional curriculum to four or five classes of students, teacherscan become their students' collaborators and coaches. The goal,clearly established in the minds of both teachers and students, isthe student's exhibition10 of understanding and proficiency.<p>        "Less is more" puts the school's library in the spotlight. Withblock scheduling and the deemphasis of textbooks, teachers can beoverwhelmed by the demands for information placed on them by theirinquisitive students. Where else can students and teachers turn tofind the information and knowledge they need but to the library?Without the library "less is more" rapidly deteriorates to "less ismuch less."<p>        In the traditional comprehensive high school, the library is amodel for the changes envisioned. It already supports this newapproach to schooling. For example, librarians greeting a studententering the library don't see a "math student" or an "Englishstudent," they see a person with a question. Attending to eachstudent's needs, the librarian typically thinks of the links andconnections between resources in a range of disciplines that mayyield results. A history book may be essential to understanding thesetting of a novel, while a math or science book will be needed tohelp understand what the characters of the same novel are talkingabout. When a school restructures itself to reflect "less is more,"it is merely catching up with the way a good library alreadyoperates, breaking down the "walls" that separate parts of thecurriculum.<p><b>Principle 3 - The school's goals should apply to all students, whilethe means to these goals will vary as those students themselves vary.School practice should be tailormade to meet the needs of every groupor class of adolescents.</b><p>        Principle 3 addresses issues of equity, heterogeneity, anddemocracy. It states flatly that the curriculum must be determinedwithin the school to meet the needs of its existing students. Thegoals of the school will apply to all students. There won't bewatered-down curriculum for some and high-powered academic curriculumfor others. Tracking is challenged, and with it the idea that somechildren are superior to others. This principle asks the question:What is school for, and for whom?<p>        Deborah Meier, co-principal of CPESS, observes that it is onlysince the Second World War that America's schools seriously haveattempted to educate most of its citizens past eighth grade.11Traditional high school structures were created and frozen in placeat a time in our history when only the children of the elite wereexpected to attend high school. These schools seemed effective, atleast in our nostalgia-befogged collective memory. Regardless, manyof our expectations of what schooling ought to be are based on thisossified tradition and history, even though the students who now fillour schools come from social groups which, by and large, were notexpected to be in high school at all back then.<p>        It is not surprising, then, that in today's high schools weencounter so many children who feel alienated. These are often thestudents whose backgrounds are least congruent with the culture andsocial expectations of the elite of fifty years ago. With very fewexceptions, the "good old days" for our working class, our poor, ourminority, and to some extent our female students simply weren't. AtCPESS, we concluded that it was up to us to learn to operatecomfortably on the turf of our actual students.<p>        If we're going to have common goals for all students, we have toaccept them and respect them as they are. We will not succeed inengaging all students if we base our curriculum and instructionalstrategies on the expectation that all students come to us knowingthe same things. They don't. We won't succeed in encouraging allstudents until we find out the way they actually think -- and whatthey think about.<p>        When learning is approached this way, it is useful to look atthe way librarians typically work. Library professionals are keenlyaware that people learn by beginning from what they already know.Usually the first questions the librarian asks when someone requestshelp to find information are What have you found out already? andWhat do you already know?<p>        At CPESS, we feel that only when a student can make sense of theenvironment he or she lives in can we expect an enthusiasticengagement with the ideas and issues affecting the wider world. Thestudent's own world has to be validated, in a serious intellectualway, in order for her to comfortably deal with the world outside thecommunity. The librarian has the responsibility to collect books andother materials that shed light on the diverse communities, cultures,and values found in the school. This makes the library a resource forteachers wanting to know what their students know and find out abouttheir lives and cultural backgrounds. This is especially true inschools in which there are students who are culturally or raciallydifferent from their teachers.<p>        In the same way, the Essential library is part of the antidoteto student alienation. It should be a central, prominent place inschool where students can routinely see their own lives andcommunities' experiences reflected in an intellectually meaningfuland positive way. Having common goals for all students implies thatall students in the school will feel a sense of ownership. Thelibrary helps them document their claims through the selections wemake and the programs we plan. At CPESS, for example, because so manyof our students are of Puerto Rican or other Latino heritage, weespecially seek out the work of Latino authors. We purchaseperiodicals that feature authentic Latino experience; we supportexhibits that focus on Latino themes. Similar considerations are madewith regard to African-American writers, artists, historical figures,and community leaders.<p>        I'd like to underline two points related to this principle.Getting to know students and their backgrounds well is essential forstudent engagement and growth. Therefore, it behooves a school, andespecially the library staff, to seek out every way they can toreflect and honor the diverse communities represented by students inthe school.<p><b>Principle 4 - Teaching and learning should be personalized to themaximum feasible extent. Efforts should be directed toward the goalthat no teacher have direct responsibility for more than eightystudents. . . . Decisions about the details of the course of study,the use of students' and teachers' time and the choice of teachingmaterials and specific pedagogies must be unreservedly placed in thehands of the principle and staff.</b><p>        This principle addresses student load and the ability of aschool to "see" individual students as they develop and grow. Adultsmust become experts on individual kids. At CPESS, every adult is anadvisor to fifteen or so students. This ensures that no student fallthrough the cracks. But relationships with students within classesmust also change.<p>        When schools try to make Essential school changes withoutreducing student contacts, the result is frustration -- "more is less"results. Teachers want and expect to do more; for example, they maytry to create new curriculum or to do "authentic assessment." With150-plus students, it is surely impossible to succeed in makingchanges like these effectively, and, if attempted, they often lead toteacher exhaustion. Such "burnout" is not only a personal disasterfor good teachers, but also poisons the climate supporting schoolchange: will teachers be willing to try new approaches when some oftheir ablest colleagues have been defeated in the effort? Trying tofollow this principle -- and the others, since they are inseparable inan Essential school -- puts enormous and unfamiliar pressures on theteaching staff. The library can help relieve these pressures.<p>        At Central Park East, our method of reducing teaching loadallows us to schedule students into two-hour blocks. Students preparetheir exhibitions either in the classroom or in the library. Teachersand the librarian plan together to coach kids individually or insmall groups. The schedule allows a seamless movement back and forthof students and materials. As a result, the library is busy all daylong; students and adults see the library as a natural extension oftheir classroom space. This kind of movement and the learning itsupports require a shift in thinking for both teachers andlibrarians.<p>        The library is transformed into something resembling a workshopwhere adults and students are engaged in real work. Intensecollaboration goes on. It is a sea of "experts" and "novices"constantly sorting and resorting themselves. Teachers preparecurriculum and coach students. Because the library serves a K-12population, older students share the space and their ideas withyounger ones. Students work alone or in groups. Teachers and studentswork side by side using computers for word processing, databasesearching or statistical analysis of data.<p>        So students routinely see teachers modeling techniques they needto learn. It is this authentic, real-world quality of the work thattakes place in the library of an Essential school that makes it sopowerful. It is very much like what happens in a family in whichyounger children learn by observing their older siblings and parents.People expect to be asked to help each other. It is one of the mostimportant results of reducing student contacts. Library rules andguidelines also shift to support these interactions, rather thaninhibiting them. Everyone's expectations change.<p><b>Principle 5 - The governing practical metaphor of the school shouldbe student-as-worker rather than the more familiar metaphor ofteacher as deliverer of educational services. Accordingly, aprominent pedagogy will be coaching, to provoke students to learn howto learn and thus to teach themselves.</b><p>        When this principle operates, a profound difference occurs inthe relationship between students, teachers, and other adults in theschool. When you are a worker in an enterprise, tasks need to beaccomplished for the good of all. While colleagues may have differentlevels of responsibility and experience, all engage in a commonpursuit. Collaboration is encouraged as everyone tries to solveproblems.<p>        Teachers at CPESS, like their peers everywhere, areknowledgeable people. They are "experts" in their disciplines andspecial interests and more experienced in many aspects of life thantheir students. But at CPESS, although they may, on occasion, lectureto their classes, they are not seen as sources of the "correct"information or guides through a distinct body of knowledge. Teachersare, instead, viewed as resources. Students are likely to seeksupport from them as they attempt to master techniques to solveproblems. But they may also seek help from other adults or from moreexperienced students.<p>        In many traditional schools, at any time of the day thelibraries are occupied by an assortment of students and adults doinga variety of activities. Each of these people knows how to do somethings well. Because the library affords the possibility of being inthe presence of someone who is an "expert" in what a student needs tolearn at any moment, it is a unique learning space in the school.<p>        Teachers and librarians have special responsibilities. We areresponsible for planning together, presenting the problem to ourstudents, putting it in a context that they can understand, andcoaching them on approaches to solutions. We introduce importanttools and demonstrate how to use them. We help students design andtest hypotheses. Good habits of mind are encouraged during theprocess. The library and its extensions influence all the classrooms,offices, and work areas of the school. It is my specialresponsibility, as librarian, to coach students and staff in thesuccessful use of the tools and techniques needed to uncover andpresent information.<p>        "Student-as-worker" is not a revolutionary concept tolibrarians. In most schools, librarians' primary way of relating tostudents is via techniques of coaching. We have created environmentsin which expert voices in a thousand areas of inquiry, the books onour shelves, are patiently awaiting consultation. Students havealways been seen as "clients" with problems to solve. Our job is tohelp put them in charge of the process, to connect them to an"expert" who knows what they need to know or how to do what they wantor need to do. "Teacher as coach" is our most succinct jobdefinition.<p>        Therefore, if school people wish to see an example of the"student-as-worker/teacher-as-coach" concept in operation, they needonly go to a good school library. There individuals or small groupsdiligently seek information. The librarian coaches on how to accessit, interpret it, evaluate it, manipulate it, and incorporate it intotheir work. Librarians feel especially thwarted when they areprevented from doing this work. It's our bread and butter. AnEssential school without a librarian? Unthinkable!Principle 6 - The diploma should be awarded upon a successful finaldemonstration of mastery for graduation -- an "Exhibition." ThisExhibition by the student of his or her grasp of the central skillsand knowledge of the school's program proceeds with no strict agegrading and with no system of "credits earned" by "time spent" inclass. The emphasis is on the students' demonstration that they cando important things.<p>        This principle speaks of how students "pass" within, and howthey graduate from, an Essential school. It invokes the ideas ofexhibitions and of mastery evaluated holistically, and it rejects theidea that students graduate when they have accumulated enoughcredits. At CPESS, each student has a Graduation Committee12 thatmeets as needed during the last two years or so of high school toevaluate portfolios in various disciplines. The work often representsmonths of individual and collaborative effort. Students mustdemonstrate through their portfolios that they have gone deeply intothe topic, that they have mastered the techniques necessary to worksuccessfully in this discipline, and that they are adept in utilizingthe habits of mind. They must demonstrate powerful thinking aboutimportant issues.<p>        The library is the primary resource for students working onthese projects. It is during their preparation for exhibitions thatstudents come to value the power of such routine library functions asthe use of the library's catalog, computer-accessed databases,indexes to periodicals, and interlibrary loan. The universalapplicability of library methodology becomes vividly clear whenstudents discover they can find necessary materials in otherlibraries using the same techniques used at their school. It is oneof the keys to lifelong learning. Maintaining this carefully craftedsystem and teaching about it are the most profound tasks we undertakeas librarians.<p><b>Principle 7 - The tone of the school should explicitly and self-consciously stress values of unanxious expectation, of trust and ofdecency. Incentives appropriate to the school's particular studentsand teachers should be emphasized, and parents should be treated asessential collaborators.</b><p>        The atmosphere in a school is apparent within a few minutes ofentering the building or campus. Sullen compliance characterizes thetone of all too many large high schools. While some are more cheerfulplaces, the common denominator seems to be student passivity, andclear lines of authority and regimentation. In nearly every school,however, there are what I like to think of as "good-tone zones."These are like islands where students can be seen actively working,collaborating and helping each other, and seeking advice from adultswho are engaged cooperatively with the students on a common project.The yearbook, the school newspaper, and some shop or performing artsprojects are familiar examples of good-tone zones.<p>        Another one of these "zones" is the library. Many librarianshave operated their libraries as though they had adopted the nineCommon Principles, even if they've never heard of them -- places ofunanxious expectation, trust, and decency. Creating this tone issimple. It requires one thing so commonly found in libraries: thepleasure we librarians take in seeing and working with our clients.Librarians know that the only reason we are there is to serve ourstudents, the staff, and other members of the community. This is thebasis of the "good tone." How are students greeted when they enterthe library? Does the conversation they have with the library staffreflect the librarian's pleasure in having them there? Is the spaceinviting, clean, comfortable? Do teachers enjoy coming there? If theanswer to most questions is "yes," the tone is probably right.<p>        Of course, not every library has this quality, but so many dothat it is easy to evoke in school people's minds the idea of how thetone of the whole school might change if the nine Common Principleswere fully implemented. Once again, good existing libraries and theirlibrarians can serve as a ready source of inspiration for schoolscontemplating basic change.<p><b>Principle 8 - The principal and teachers should perceive themselvesas generalists first (teachers and scholars in general education) andspecialists second (experts in but one particular discipline). Staffshould expect multiple obligations (teacher-counselor-manager) and asense of commitment to the entire school.</b><p>        There are strong institutional pressures on high school teachersto be specialists. Everything from university "methods" courses tostate education department certification requirements to the structures of our schools themselves -- not to mention our own andcommunity expectations -- conspires to point us in the direction ofspecialization.<p>        In an Essential school, people are not defined or limited bytheir specialties, titles, or credentials. Librarians, teachers,counselors, secretaries, principals, and bus drivers should all havea stake in the school. To change school in ways consistent with thenine Common Principles, professionals wear many hats and are moreconcerned with what their impact is on the entire school than withtheir individual department or activity. It is less important whobecomes the student's collaborator than that someone does.<p>        Like all educators, we at CPESS -- and in the Coalition generally-- make choices and compromises. We believe that to create the kind ofintellectual communities we value, it is more important that we seethe ways in which all knowledge is connected than that we preservethe separateness of a particular subject. It is critical to create aschool community in which everyone, student and adult, is activelyengaged in learning.<p>        A teacher recently came to me with a problem. She wanted to findout whether a series of books with immigration themes was in printand what it would cost to buy them. As a library specialist, I wasable to quickly search Books in Print and get her the information,but I also was able to engage her in conversation about why shewanted these books. I happen to have an interest in history, and Icould suggest several agencies I know about that deal withimmigration history. Thus, items that had nothing to do with myspecial skill as a librarian enhanced the curricular possibilities ofthis humanities class.<p>        Librarians have always balanced the dual roles of generalist andspecialist. We respond to requests reflecting every discipline. It isnatural for us to see the way knowledge intersects. At CPESS, thelibrary has been set up to have a central role in the school. Becauseof this, I feel the responsibility to know and contribute to what isgoing on throughout the school. The librarian should have a place inevery meeting in which curriculum is being discussed, to contributeboth generalist ideas and expertise about existing resources. Weshould be assertive in our schools in insisting that the researchskills students need in order to develop their exhibitions becomepart of everyone's consciousness. Our success as librarians dependson the success of the school in implementing these nine CommonPrinciples. The duality of role as generalist and specialist makesthe whole thing work.<p><b>Principle 9 - Ultimate administrative and budget targets shouldinclude, in addition to total student loads per teacher of eighty orfewer pupils, substantial time for collective planning by teachers,competitive salaries for staff and an ultimate per pupil cost not toexceed that at traditional schools by more than 10 percent. . . . Theadministrative plans may have to show the phased reduction orelimination of some services now provided students in manytraditional comprehensive secondary schools.</b><p>        Before anything about this principle is said, we need toacknowledge that the whole enterprise of public education, not tomention public libraries, is being starved for funds. Never has therebeen more opportunity for positive reform, and never have theresources been so scarce. It is difficult and possibly unethical toask teachers and librarians to undertake the kinds of changes andprofessional risks implied here. The real risk is that they might noteven have jobs next year or, if they do, they may be asked to do morewith fewer resources.<p>        When the final principle suggests that to gain the power of"less is more" without a major increase in funding, comprehensiveschools may need to eliminate some things they now offer, we mustrecognize the fiscal constraints that many schools have beenoperating within; even without restructuring change, schools havebeen forced to drop many worthwhile services they once offered. Ibelieve that in the midst of all this talk about school change, wemust raise the issue of adequate funding for public education inevery forum we can.<p>        No matter what the funding, it is still worthwhile, however, toconsider how a school can reduce teacher-student contacts to a ratioof 80:1 without increased expenditure. The choices that are necessaryto stay within the guidelines of this principle are unique to eachschool. However, the library in every school is one of theindispensable parts of what makes it possible to significantlyincrease individual students' time with educators -- generalists andspecialists. The vision of students working on their own, takingcharge of their own educational process, cannot seriously happen in alibrary-less environment.<p>        Unfortunately, in many places librarians, despite their goodwork, are thought of as outside the main circle of decision making inthe school. Is it any wonder that many librarians have become lessthan aggressive in advancing their contribution to overallrestructuring activities? If librarians are to succeed in helping tochange their schools, three things must happen. First, in new andmore persuasive ways, librarians must once again demonstrate to theirstaffs and school communities that they are already practicing theessential core of the nine Common Principles every day in theirlibraries. Second, librarians must reinvigorate their awareness ofwhat classroom teachers are doing. Third, teachers, administrators,and community school stakeholders must acquire a new appreciation ofthe library as an essential element of the restructured school. Evenif they are unaware of it, librarians can show the way to qualitativeschool change -- think how much more powerful they will be when theyare aware! Look at the librarians in nearly any high school library,and see the future.<p><hr><h2>The CPESS Library</h2><hr>        The library at Central Park East Secondary School is not especially"state of the art." As of spring 1993, there is not yet an on-linecatalog. The book stock is not massive. Moreover, a tiny school likeCPESS could never support a library large enough to meet the needs ofstudents who are seeking to delve deeply into diverse areas ofinquiry as they prepare their exhibitions and graduation portfolioprojects.<p>        Yet this library fits my description of an Essential schoollibrary. As in the school generally, the most important element isthe relationships between people, rather than the quantity of itemsavailable. Of course, it is nice to have access to as much usefulmaterial as possible. Still, the cardinal thing offered is not theobjects, it is the techniques. Knowing how to use them, how to accessthem, how to ask for the right kind of help, and feeling entitled toask are the benchmarks of this library. Its goal is to be able to getany student or adult started, to help them focus on what the basicproblems are, and to coach them through to mastery of the requiredskills. The library becomes a workshop, or studio, where adults andstudents are engaged in real work.<p>        At CPESS, teachers routinely pose provocative questions. Oftenthese questions are developed by the teaching team in meetings withthe librarian. Students don't simply write these questions down. Thequestions are chewed over, thought about, and in most cases they leadto an exhibition. From the time the question is posed, students spendtime trying to develop an approach to developing their ideas aboutit. Teachers try to anticipate the tools their students may need. Forexample, the essential question "Whose country is it anyway?" leadsto many more questions. Teachers coach their students as they uncoverresources, analyze them, and begin to form their response to thequestion.<p>        The library is prepared to operate in a similar manner: itbegins with a question, a need to uncover information. The librariandoes not routinely give the item over to the student. Insteadstudents are coached through the steps they need to uncover theinformation for themselves. Students are prompted to consider how theitems they find fit into citations and how they relate to associatedclasses of information that might be useful or interesting.<p>        Some exhibitions are designed entirely around the library. Forexample, one examined the paths of modern civil rights leaders andcompared them to nineteenth-century leaders. This work involved thestudent in developing a bibliography of materials located in theCPESS library and far beyond it, and then borrowing the items.Primary sources on microfiche were located. And then, over a periodof several months, the job of synthesizing all this material,developing a hypothesis and preparing the exhibition happened in aclosely orchestrated pattern, led by the student, and coached by thesubject teacher, the student's advisor, and the library staff.<p><hr><h2>From CPESS to the World</h2><hr>        Mid-Manhattan Library is located in a former multistorydepartment store across the street from the main research building ofNew York Public Library at Forty-second Street. Mid-Manhattan wasestablished to provide a resource for college and high schoolstudents in the city. It is large and very busy. The staff deals withthousands of people every day. The only problem with Mid-Manhattan isthat there need to be seven of them.<p>        Despite the overburdened staff and the crowds of patrons, Mid-Manhattan is the main back-up library for our students. For most highschool people, it is an intimidating place. So, when students makeMid-Manhattan Library work for them, they feel on top of the world.Many of the exhibitions students undertake, especially at the SeniorInstitute level,13 require them to discover and use resources beyondthe CPESS library. From the minute we meet students in our school,they are taught to expect this. We train them to search for titlesthey will need using the regional on-line catalog MILCS.14 Wedescribe to them what they will encounter at Mid-Manhattan and thendebrief them when they return, usually triumphant but sometimesfrustrated. It's almost an intellectual rite of passage, and whenthey have mastered Mid-Manhattan, they know they have reached a newplateau in their development.<p>        There is another way for students or staff to obtain books notin the CPESS library. The library is part of the New York City SchoolLibrary System, which in turn is a member of METRO, a regionalcooperative library agency bringing together resources in university,public, and school libraries. By searching MILCS, books located inhigh school libraries can be delivered to CPESS in a few days. Therich library resources of New York City are easily tapped whenstudents have coach-librarians to help them learn how. Most schoolsare in a position to complement their in-school resources -- forexample, through regional networks -- but need to coach students totake advantage of these research opportunities.<p>        Because of the deemphasis of textbooks at CPESS, trade books andother materials are highly prized. Whether it's multiple copies of anovel or a very deep collection offering multiple points of view tosupport a curricular focus area, this library is very responsive toand reflective of what is going on in the school's classrooms. Theallocations normally directed toward textbook purchases are oftenused to obtain materials that can be thought of as library materials.At CPESS there is a deliberate ambiguity about the boundaries of thelibrary and its holdings. The library is, in a sense, everywhere inthe building. What constitutes the difference between a library bookand a textbook is decidedly hazy, but there are no jurisdictionaldisputes here.<p>        Last year, the Science team in Division 2 (ninth and tenthgrades) wanted to buy a series of physics books to have as referencesin their classrooms, and they wanted a copy of each in the library aswell. It is noteworthy that they were not inviting me to help themdecide on a particular textbook, but rather to locate seven or eightdifferent textbooks ostensibly "covering" high school physics. Theywanted kids to see different approaches to the same problems. Ihelped them, and those books are currently quite useful resources inthe library, and not only for the Division 2 students. If a studentcomes to the library seeking solution to a physics problem and thebooks are out, I know they are in those classrooms as well and candirect the student there. Now what are those books? Library books ortextbooks? Suppose the student wants to borrow the book from theclassroom? Bookkeeping and circulation records are a bit morecomplex, but when we get our bar-coded circulation system up andrunning, this problem will be more manageable.<p>        There are times when teachers bring an entire class to thelibrary to work on a project there. Often I have met earlier with theteacher and gone over what could be found in the library to supportthe students' projects. One teacher, for example, in the early stagesof his "Peopling of America" curriculum, asked me to show hisstudents how they could find biographical information of variousexplorers, some of whom were not well known. When they came, Imodeled a typical search, uncovering some unexpected sources, likemagazine articles, and then demonstrated how I thought they shouldrecord their findings in bibliographic form. The teacher thenprompted them to search for their own explorer. We coached studentsas they attempted to find the information they needed. Mostly,however, this kind of work with students is not done with wholeclasses, but rather with individuals or small groups.<p>        One result of the way students use the library at CPESS is theshift in the norms of student behavior. The whole library operationhas been geared to creating a productive working environment. Thisaffects everything. There is an underlying assumption that studentswho are in the library are there for a serious, worthwhile purpose,that they see the adults not as authorities but as collaborators(although, when necessary, it's clear that adults can beauthorities). The rules reflect this belief. Students can come to thelibrary freely. Only under certain circumstances do they need a"pass." The decision to come to the library is made by the student inconsultation with a classroom teacher, or by the student herself ifno class is in session. Students may need to consult each other asthey work, so the rule about talking in the library is to respect --and so not to interfere with -- work going on, rather than maintainsilence. Students expect to offer technical help to each other,whether it's interpreting the card catalog or getting a commandsequence right when searching a database. Students expect to be askedto learn how to do whatever they need help with, rather than to haveit done for them. For example, students needing information on theoil crisis of the early '70s develop a list of magazine articlesusing the Reader's Guide and then learn how microfiche are stored,how the fiche reader/printer works, and what to do with the fichewhen the work is done. Teach a few students those skills and thetechnique quickly spreads through the school as students "in theknow" explain it to students who don't know yet. Collaboration is thenorm of the school and the library.<p>        Another important aspect of CPESS's library is its role as thehub of computing activity within the school. As librarian, I havecontributed to the process of defining the computing strategy of theschool. I assist the staff in the selection and upgrading of softwareand hardware and suggest possibilities for integrating computing intothe life of the classroom. In the library, we demonstrate computingactivities that can empower learners seeking information, and we haveintroduced telecommunications to students and teachers. I have foundthat these things fit comfortably within the traditional mission ofthe library.<p>        An increasing amount of the work of the library is conductedelectronically. For example, one student recently completed ageometry project that involved designing a house and estimating thequantities of materials it would require and the costs. This studentelected to produce this report on the computer, which involvedcreating a word-processing document, importing the graphics he haddesigned using a "draw" program, and importing data from aspreadsheet and using it to create a graph. All of this wasincorporated into the original word-processing document. As we obtainaccess to more and more powerful electronic information resources, astudent or teacher in our small library in a small school will havethe power to access the world.<p>        CPESS students feel ownership of their library. In many waysthey run it as well. Under my supervision, a crew of studentsperforms their three-hours-per-week Community Service project there.Still others work before classes begin and after school or onSaturday mornings. Students operate the circulation system. Theycoach their schoolmates and sometimes their teachers on how to do on-line searches or on how to use other computer applications. Theymaintain the card catalog and teach students how to use it. Theyshelve books and process new ones. They maintain the periodical andmicrofiche files. In short, it's unimaginable to operate this kind oflibrary without a large cadre of student workers.<p>        The development of Essential schools offers an opportunity forgreat improvement in our educational system. In the process of thesechanges it is important for all the participants to understand thecentral role of the library. In many traditional schools, the libraryalready serves as an example of the kind of schooling we are workingtoward. In all schools, the library must become an integrated elementin the change process. Many walls need to be knocked down, as when webuilt our library at CPESS. Most walls are not made of brick andmortar.<p><hr><h2>Footnotes</h2><hr><ol><li> Central Park East Secondary School was founded in 1985.

What They Do, How They Work</H1></center>                <hr>                                <center>Volume 7, Number 1<BR> September 1990</center><hr>                           When teachers at Kentucky's Fairdale High School were planning the start oftheir Essential School program, principal Marilyn Hohmann likes to recall, someof them spent a full week shadowing students through their daily schedules. Byweek's end, they were overwhelmed --not by the demands of student life, but byits passive and anonymous nature. If their program could do only one thing, theydecided, it must be to turn those qualities around, to energize the studentsinto forging an active personal stake in their own education. Today, Fairdaleschedules a daily half-hour Teacher Guided Assistance period for all students Ñan advisory group in which 17 mixed-grade students work individually andtogether on both personal and academic matters. A whopping 90 percent ofstudents call it the best thing about their school.<p>   At Pasadena High School last year, all 650 ninth graders began an EssentialSchool program that called for an hour-long advisory period three days a week.In groups of 20 to 30, students met with their teacher-adviser for activitiesdesigned to foster leadership, build self-esteem, and resolve conflicts. By theend of the year in this urban California high school with a 75 percent minoritystudent body, the ninth-grade attendance rate was 96 percent --twice as high asfor any other grade in the school.<p>   The faculty at Bellefonte Area High School, a small school in a mostly white,blue-collar Pennsylvania community, voted to go slowly this year on the startupof their Essential School program through the state's Re:Learning project. Butthough only two-thirds of Bellefonte's ninth-grade class will follow anEssential curriculum this year, the whole school decided to institute a dailyfifteen-minute Active Communication Time (ACT) period, scheduled into the lunchhour. To help teachers who are uneasy about what to do with the time, the schoolprovides a handbook of guidelines and suggested activities for the 15-studentgroups. And advisers are backed by a team of professionals that is called in forcounseling, guidance, or intervention when a serious problem arises.<p>   Making a student's education more personal is the base on which all thecommon principles of Essential schooling stand; and in many schools like these,advisory groupings are emerging as one way to work toward this aim. If even oneteacher in a school knows a student well and cares what happens to her, thetheory goes, chances increase dramatically for that student's academic success.More, advisory groups can promote the principles of unanxious expectation,trust, and decency in students' relations with their teachers and others, bothin school and outside it.<p>   But are advisory groups the path toward personalizing a student's schoolexperience, or merely a lightweight substitute for paying individual attentionto intellectual development in the classroom itself? Should life issues beincluded in advisory sessions, or should their focus be primarily academic?Where is the line between teacher and guidance counselor, between adviser andparent-substitute, between private dilemmas and social or intellectualobligations? As we looked at such programs in a dozen Essential schoolsnationwide, it became clear that advisories serve as a lightning rod for many ofthe most provoking questions facing school people today. Whether the advisorygroup is "essential" --a key tool in a school's commitment to the principles ofthe Coalition of Essential Schools --is a question individual schools mustexplore as they move toward change.<p><hr><h2>What Are Advisories For?</h2><hr>One view of the advisory's purpose assumes that to know a student individuallymeans to know his mind well --the better to work with him in a classroomcontext. For best results, argues the Coalition's Director for Schools, BobMcCarthy, the system should match advisers with students they actually teach,not arbitrarily as it sometimes done. Further, the purpose of an advisorysession should be to work on developing, both individually and in a groupcontext, the inquiring habits of mind that mark a scholar. Socratic seminars,book discussion groups, debate on school and community issues, and philosophicalinvestigations might all augment one-on-one coaching in this model of theadvisory relationship.<p>   But many of the programs we looked at were shaped along much different lines.To know a student's mind well is not enough, they posit if his education istruly to have meaning in the real world, it must address his situation insociety too. The advisory group is used, in these schools, to practice skills ingroup dynamics and human relations that can be used for everything fromgoverning a school to making the most personal decisions. And the individualcommitment teachers make to their advisees aims to forge bonds that include thestudent's home and private life as a crucial part of schooling.<p>   In practice, if we try to separate advisory groups into two models, theacademic and the personal, the lines between them will quickly blur. "Kids don'tlet you do it," says Bob McCarthy. "They are going to push you to take anintellectual discussion into a concrete realm that makes sense in their world."Likewise, advisory groups may discuss the most personal of issues while applyingprinciples of evidence and argument that train students in critical thinking."If you start a discussion about what you'd do if you were drafted to fight foroil against Iraq," says McCarthy, "the answer has to be worked out against areal investigation of the political and economic situation in the Middle Eastand the West."<p>   In fact, some of the best advisory group discussions start with historical,literary, or scientific situations that pose compelling moral dilemmas. In her1984 book Making Decisions, from which several exercises are reproduced here,Nancy Faust Sizer sets out such cases in 26 pairs --one drawn from students' ownenvironment, one from the world at large to encourage analytical thinking andmoral reasoning. Emphasizing respect for the reasoning process over the actualoutcome of the decision, she argues, allows students to "compare, dissect,resolve" their common and individual principles. (Published by LongmanPublishing Group in White Plains, New York, the book is currently out of print;for more information contact Nancy Sizer, P.O. Box 472, Harvard, MA 01451.)<p>   In the end, it seems, the main point of a good advisory program is to helpthe student feel that it matters what he is doing with his mind and his life andto recognize the ways in which the two relate. "The adviser is often the onlyadult in school who has a clear notion of a student's whole schedule, whole day,and whole life," says Rick Lear, a senior researcher at the Coalition ofEssential Schools. "It makes the system much more sensitive when a kid has aproblem. The adviser has a sense of whether the problem lies in an academicarea, or with a particular teacher, or in some life problem. Advisers becomeadvocates for kids in the system --sometimes they are even referred toexplicitly by that title."<p>   Is it really necessary to make formal time for teacher-student interaction inorder to attain a more personal education? "Very good teachers often have thiskind of relationship with their students already," says Kent Lowry, a teachingintern and adviser at New York's Scarsdale Alternative High School, whereadvisory "core groups" have long been in place. "But setting aside a timeespecially for that purpose means things that might otherwise slip through thecracks can be caught. I've always enjoyed chatting with kids when I run intothem informally, but it's rare for that kind of discussion to come to any realconclusion. Our core groups have the time to work through an issue. It'senormously satisfying, for kids and teachers both." Making advisory groups aformal part of a school's system also means that every student --not just themost engaging, or the easiest to talk to --gets personal attention, Lowry notes."It communicates that everyone is valued here," he says.<p><hr><h2>How Advisories Differ</h2><hr>In practice, the advisory groups we saw included a broad mix of purposes andtechniques. Sometimes academic or even remedial in nature, sometimes almostpurely social or personal, they have grown from each school's own vision of itsneeds and priorities, its students and its community.<p>   The adviser-student relationship may be as simple as a brief daily encounterin which students can touch base with someone who has a special interest intheir progress. It may have a primarily administrative focus, with the advisermonitoring attendance, helping plan a schedule, and meeting to discuss gradesand future plans. Or it may provide a steady arena in which intellectual habitsand challenges are addressed.<p>   "One of the best advisory sessions I have seen was at Paschal High School inFort Worth, Texas," says Coalition Chairman Ted Sizer. "The teacher organizedkids into small groups to work on homework in various subject areas. She wentfrom group to group, guiding them individually and encouraging them to help eachother out too. The whole purpose was to make sure the students were as ready asthey could be to make good use of their formal class time." In this group,students were clearly active learners, and the teacher served as the generalist-coach, who was there to help them teach themselves. This is also the model usedin Fairdale's Teacher Guided Assistance (TGA) program, which encourages studentsto make up tests during advisory time, seek extra help from teachers, or visitthe library. "Our groups mix kids from different grade levels," says principalHohmann, "so a lot of peer tutoring goes on during TGA."<p>   Academic enrichment is also built into advisory sessions when teachers usethem as book discussion groups. "Two things could happen at once," one principalsays who favors this model for his school. "The kids could stretch their mindsby reading interesting works of clear value, maybe introducing controversialissues; and their discussions could generate critical thinking and get teachersand kids to know each other as they explore different important questionsthrough reading."<p>   Building a strong student role in their own government is an important aim ofsome advisory groups. At Scarsdale, for example, the 75 students of thealternative school gather in a weekly community meeting to vote on governanceissues facing the school. Much of the discussion surrounding these issues takesplace in the more manageable context of core group meetings. "It takes a whileto clarify these things," Kent Lowry says. "When we address them first in smallgroups, the whole-school meeting is much more effective." In other schools too,student government issues are often addressed in advisory groups. In fact, atthe much larger Pasadena High School, principal Judy Codding has brought inScarsdale's Anthony Arenella and Rosellen Rachinelli to lead workshops instudent governance techniques, using advisory groups as their basic unit.<p>   Almost all advisory programs make some effort to help students plan forcareer and college, though few actually substitute advisory groups forconventional college and vocational guidance counseling. Planning field trips tocolleges and career fairs, practicing interviews, and doing exercises designedto identify personal strengths and goals all can take place in advisory groups.<p>   Some advisory groups carry out community service projects; and some schoolsuse the time for special presentations or other activities that bring the schoolcommunity together. At Pasadena High School, teacher Judy Oksner has brought inspeakers from area prisons, local artists, and junior achievement groups whorotate among advisory groups or speak to the school at large. "We also use thetime for theater games or athletic round robins --sometimes purely sillycompetitions just for fun --so that students can get to know those in othergroups," Oksner says.<p><hr><h2>Advising the "Whole Student"</h2><hr>Scarsdale's core groups have developed a tradition of meeting in the students'homes on a weekly rotating basis. This is unusual; but in most schools gettingto know the students' home situation is an integral task of the adviser. Manyschools expect advisers to call parents regularly not only with problems butwith praise for a student's progress; regular home visits and parent conferencesare a feature of several programs we looked at. In addition, advisers oftencheck on absent students, make sure they keep up with their work when ill, orarrange professional help if necessary.<p>   Most advisory systems also serve as the first step in resolving disciplineissues, either individually or in the group. At New York City's UniversityHeights High School, where "family groups" of around 18 students meet daily, arepresentative of each group serves on the school's "fairness committee," whichresolves discipline problems by consensus. "The term 'advisory' implies an adultgiving advice," says principal Nancy Mohr, who frequently leads workshops onadvisories. "Our model is based on group work."<p>   Across town at Central Park East Secondary School, an hour-long advisoryperiod is also scheduled daily, and discipline problems go directly to theadviser. "One day I was leading a humanities class and two students from myadvisory group were brought in to me with an argument: they had to work togetheron a math project and one kid wasn't bringing in his share of the work," formerCPE teacher Michael Goldman recalls. "When I had a moment I went to the back ofthe room to talk with them.  I knew that the second kid's parents were divorcing,and sure enough, the problem came up because he was living in two differentplaces and the work kept getting left behind. Addressing the question in a waythat let the kid know someone cared about his situation made it much easier towork out a solution."<p>   Goldman is among the many teachers who have used "dialogue journals" betweenstudents and teachers as a private arena in which to bring up important issues.Others go even further, introducing exercises in group dynamics to trainstudents to open up emotional and behavioral issues. Such teachers see theiractivities as educating the whole person, not invading a private arena. "If youcan't identify what you think and feel and why, you won't get far in anintellectual discussion," one said. "Listening, problem-solving, and conflictresolution are life skills and analytical skills. They require training andpractice."<p><hr><h2>The Problems, the Rewards</h2><hr>Whether their focus is primarily academic or personal, advisory groups requirenew roles for most public school teachers, and they are often frightening ones.To advise a group well may take training in new skills, and it will certainlytake more time, both to prepare for the advisory sessions and to invest inindividual students. The results, say those who do it, are well worth theeffort; but in the process new questions are raised about the roles teachers andstudents should play in our educational system.<p>   No one denies that advisory groups make extra work for teachers. If thegroup's goals are well articulated, to reach them involves careful planningÑinessence, an entire new curriculum may emerge, including anything from consensusbuilding and human relations to philosophical explorations, study skills, orcareer planning. Some schools, believing that the main point is to get to knowstudents better, leave the use of advisory time completely up to individualteachers and groups. Others set up more formal expectations, but allowsubstantial variation in how to meet them. In either case, preparing for anadvisory session is just as important as preparing for a class, and many schoolshelp teachers out with handouts, workshops, and suggestions.<p>   "Typically people start out trying to narrowly describe what they will do, soit won't be overwhelming," says the Coalition's Rick Lear, who often works withschools just beginning advisory efforts. "Then as teachers get to know kids theydevelop their own sense of what's appropriate and what their limits are. Withinany one building there will be a range of responses --those who are morecomfortable will make themselves more available to both students and parents."Still, he concedes, advisories do take more time than people once expected."You're getting involved in the lives of kids," he says.<p>   Some teachers thrive on this; others back off from the intensity of theexperience. In his days at Central Park East Mike Goldman, for example, wouldgive students and parents his home phone and set evening calling hours forbetween six and seven. "I never once had a student or parent abuse theprivilege," he says. But one teacher at an alternative school with a highpriority on home visits told me that the level of involvement in students' liveswas "too much for me. I'm leaving to teach in a more strictly academicsituation."<p>   Especially if a school's advisory focus is more broadly defined, some schoolpeople balk at giving advice to young adults on personal issues. "Some thingsare rightly none of my business," one teacher told me. "They're the parentaldomain--they're not for me to know." In many cases, though, teachers must cometo terms with the fact that if they do not care about the personal lives oftheir students, no one else will either. For schools in troubled communitieslike Central Falls, Rhode Island, this raises a particularly poignant point: theadvisory relationship may be the only haven a student has. "There's a strongcommunity feeling here among students and faculty," says Central Falls HighSchool language teacher Robin Yates, "partly because of the contrasts betweenthe school, the home, and the street. School is a safe place for these kids, andthey tend to like it and want to be here."<p>   Once somebody does start to care, in whatever context, the results can beswift. Because 45 percent of Central Falls students come from homes whereEnglish is not spoken, the school's substantial bilingual program served as animportant predecessor to its new advisory system. "I started using dialoguejournals to develop literacy," says Yates. "But the kids kept using them tobring up very important issues. It got down to the most fundamental culturalquestions about the meaning of schooling: what the role of teacher and studentshould be. And that gave rise to the essential question we'll be exploring as westart our Coalition team this year."<p>   Ironically, however, a successful advisory effort can make a teacher's lifeharder, as more difficult students show up in class regularly. "Now that they'recoming, you have to figure out what to do with them," Pasadena High's JudyOksner says. "They are not only poor academically but they can present behaviorproblems."<p><hr><h2>Teachers, or Counselors?</h2><hr>Many teachers are reluctant to get involved in advisory programs because theyfear they are unqualified to deal with serious problems that might arise. Toaddress this, most schools encourage continual dialogue between guidance staffand teachers, emphasizing that the adviser's role is to spot problems, notnecessarily to solve them, and training teachers to recognize signs of trouble.More serious behavioral or emotional problems, such as drug or alcohol use, areusually referred to guidance counselors or other professionals, although in someschools the adviser takes part in those meetings. The advisory relationship herecan serve as a crucial early warning system, school people say. "All I had toread was a hint in her advisory journal that one student was thinking aboutsuicide," one teacher told me. "The safety net went out, and the student gotcounseling in time to help. At no time did I have to actually sit down with thestudent and counsel her about her suicide plans --I wouldn't have been preparedfor that --but the system saved her."<p>   Others balk at a quasi-guidance role for teachers for a more politicalreason: they worry that guidance staff will be cut with the change, or thattheir own work will unfairly be increased. The evidence is that advisoriesaugment rather than substitute for the guidance counselor's job. But otheradministrative changes may be necessary to put an advisory system into place. Agroup of perhaps 15 seems the ideal size, for instance; but this may beunworkable given the student-teacher ratio. To solve this some schools askadministrators, librarians, and other non-teaching staff to serve as advisers.Other schools may need waivers from teacher contract clauses or districtregulations, especially when advisory groups count as a credit-bearing class.<p>   Any advisory position can get sticky; those who do it best are comfortableworking with opposing interests. "Being an advocate for a kid may put you inconflict with your peers," Rick Lear says. "It could be another teacher thestudent is having problems with."<p>   The new role also can cause discomfort as teachers start thinking ofthemselves not solely as evaluative educators, but as coaches involved in boththe intellectual and the emotional lives of their students. "This may lead to adecision to consider the evaluative relationship itself differently," notesCoalition senior researcher Patricia Wasley. "It ties right in to exhibitions,interestingly --the more you know about what a student is interested in, themore effectively you can coach her to demonstrate mastery. But this moreholistic approach requires a significant leap for teachers."<p>   But even teachers who oppose Essential School startup efforts often warm tothe advisory concept, seeing it as a chance to improve the tone of a schooltroubled by apathy or social problems. At Central Falls, a schoolwide committeeon advisories met separately from the Essential School steering committee; thisyear all teachers will serve as advisers, though only the seventh grade willstart an Essential team. Similarly, Bellefonte High will introduce advisoriesschoolwide even as its Essential program begins with more modest numbers. "Wesaw the tone of our school going downhill in the last few years," says SusanRobb, "and we needed to do something for all our kids. It wasn't necessarily thedropout rate; it was a poor attitude about being in school."<p><hr><h2>A Change in Tone</h2><hr>Teachers who have worked with advisories for years say their extra efforts payoff dramatically in the classroom. "I've seen drastic changes in studentsbecause someone cares about them as an adviser," says Mike Goldman of his yearsat Central Park East. "Attendance goes up; the kids work harder; study skillsand academic performance improve." A good advisory system, he argues, sets atone in which students want to come. "Small groups don't fall apart," Goldmansays emphatically. "The advisory group breaks down the 'house' concept one morestep --it sets up a family group within the larger house family."<p>   As new advisory programs get going, even teachers who are not predisposedtoward their new role report satisfying results. In Pasadena, says Judy Oksner,one 34-year teaching veteran who "always hated field trips or anything likethat" began to have extraordinary success in advisory group activities. "At theend of the year he had the entire group over to his home for a swimming party,where they presented a check to a local charity." The teachers who were mostafraid of the adviser role sometimes end up as its biggest fans, the Coalition'sRick Lear concurs. "Teachers tell me they know and understand the kids better;they start to see parents as allies," he says. "As they build betterconnections, their professional experience becomes richer."<p>   At the graduation ceremony for Scarsdale Alternative High School each year,each senior is toasted in a brief speech by the student's adviser. "It may beteasing or warm, describing their contribution to the school or to the largersociety --but for each student it's unique," Kent Lowry says. "For many studentsit is the highlight of their school career, to be publicly recognized for whatis special about them. And it's only possible because we know them." Whether aschool is small or large, whether its advisory program is loosely defined orcarefully structured, that sense of personal recognition is at the heart of theadvisory concept. "I know very few teachers who have worked as advisers for acouple of years and would willingly give it up," says Rick Lear. "It's the hookinto kids." <p><hr>                           <h2>Some Advisory Group Models</h2><hr>Some ways advisory groups can be organized and scheduled:<p><ul><li>As a credit-bearing hour-long daily Family Group meeting, including one dayweekly set aside for help with academic work.

They had French and basketball in common, and the rest seemedto go along of its own accord. They kept lots of company with each other for thefirst few weeks.<p>   As time went on, however, there was little doubt that they were headed fordifferent crowds. Jenny was sophisticated, impulsive, charming; she knew morekids in the school from the first day. Her parents were both fancy lawyers,which Sandy found hard even to imagine. Sandy's father worked in a drugstore andher mother was a housewife. She was shy, and found it harder to make friends.<p>   Looks were a lot of it. Jenny was tall and pretty, with long dark hair. Sandyblamed herself for being "too medium": medium height and weight, and mediumbrown hair.<p>   Jenny felt terrible about it, but slowly she began to drop Sandy as a friend.She still liked her. They hadn't had a fight or anything, but after a while sheeven stopped walking to basketball practice with her. She hoped she'd never haveto explain it. But she really didn't know how she could fit Sandy in with hernew friends.<p><b>Questions to ask:</b><p><ul><li>Is it true that one can tell what a person is like by who his friends are? Inwhat ways?<li>Why did the friendship between Sandy and Jenny take place? Why did it change?<li>How much do looks influence one's friendships? How much should they?<li>Are teenagers more influenced by looks than adults? If so, are there goodexplanations for this?<li> Did Jenny have the right to drop Sandy?

She alsogives many examples of deceptions: stated and unstated, blatant and subtle,"necessary" and unnecessary, omissions and exaggerations, some undertaken "for'others, others for oneself, some undertaken in order to uncover even deeperdeceptions, or to reveal an even deeper truth.<p>   Many of us tolerate what we call "white" lies because we think that they areharmless, or undertaken to avoid disharmony or for a good purpose. Mrs. Bok,however, asserts that lies are always taken more seriously by those who havebeen lied to than by those who have lied. She believes that one must be carefulto avoid them, no matter how "innocent" they may appear, because of what theycan do to an atmosphere of trust.<p>   Listed below are examples of such more "innocent" deceptions:<p><ul><li>A teacher exaggerates the abilities of her student in a college recommendationletter<li>A person says he has a headache in order to avoid a party he doesn't want toattend<li> A police car is unmarked<li>A doctor lets his patient go on holiday without telling him that he is dyingof cancer<li>A mother tells her daughter that she looks nice when she really doesn't.</ul><p>   Mrs. Bok also cites examples of deceptions or purposeful concealments thatcannot be called "innocent," even in quotation marks, either because they arefar more blatant or are more self-serving.

British code-breakers had managed to read Germancodes through an elaborate combination of stolen machines, Polish spies,interceptions, and brilliant and continuous decoding. The information gained inthis way was called "Ultra"; it was gathered in the most careful and quiet waypossible, and the British took great pains to keep the Germans from knowing thatthey had it. Obviously, if the Germans knew, they would simply adopt new codes,perhaps ones the British couldn't break.<p>   During the Battle of Britain, when Hitler was sending waves of planes, firstto terrorize London, then to destroy England's airfields, the code was somewhathelpful on early warning. Since the cities and airfields were obvious targets,the British could be expected to be ready with evacuation plans and fireengines. Other information, easily obtained by a modern nation, could beperceived in mid-flight; thus short-term, public adjustments could be madewithout creating suspicion.<p>   But in November 1940 the cryptographers in Bletchley learned that Hitler wasgoing to change his plans. Angrily responding to a bombing of Berlin which hehad promised the German people could never occur, he decided suddenly to give upbombing strategic targets and instead bomb the nearby British provincial city ofCoventry. The news was brought straight to Winston Churchill, the new primeminister, as one of the most terrible moral dilemmas of his career. If he actedon his knowledge, he would evacuate people and remove property, thus savingthem; but he might also alert the Germans to the fact that he had "Ultra."<p>   It was a clear choice between the present and the future, and the future wasunknown. How many secrets might be learned if the Germans failed to suspect theBritish? Even if the Germans suspected, would they give up their code? Mightthey give up their code anyway? What about the lives that would be lostneedlessly? What about the property, which included the historic Coventrycathedral?<p>   The Americans, not yet in the war, were not told of Churchill's dilemma untilthe decision had been made. They might not have been much help. The U.S.Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, didn't entirely believe in code-breaking; hebelieved that "gentlemen do not read each other's mail." And when Rooseveltlearned of the situation, he said, "War is forcing us more and more to play God.I don't know what I should have done."<p>   To Churchill, knowledge was desirable, even crucial, but it was alsoterrible. He dared not ignore it and he dared not act on it. What would you havedone if you had been in his shoes?<p>Reprinted with the permission of Nancy Faust Sizer.<p><hr>                      <h2>Terranova: An Extra-Territorial Tale</h2><hr>There was in the nineteenth century an Italian sailor called Terranova, whoworked on an American ship, the Emily, chartered in Baltimore but also workingout of Salem, Massachusetts. Terranova was swabbing the decks one day when theship was at port in Canton, China, when a Chinese woman, standing on her littlejunk which was perched up against the ship, began to call to him. He was angryat the way the Chinese edged up against the ship; they had been asked not to,several times. He also obviously didn't understand what she was saying, andafter a while her persistent calling to him began to get on his nerves. At somepoint, either by accident or perhaps otherwise, Terranova's jug, which wasstanding on the rail full of water to use in his swabbing, fell off the rail andlanded on or near the woman below. She fell into the water, and, because she wasstunned and also didn't know how to swim, she drowned.<p>   A life had been lost; Chinese authorities believed that harmony would notreturn until something had been done to redress the balance. They thereforedemanded that Terranova be given up to the Chinese authorities for determinationof what his responsibility had been for her death, and also for possiblepunishment. The captain of the Emily, believing Terranova's violentprotestations that the whole thing had been an accident, doubted the ability ofthe Chinese to give Terranova a fair trial as he understood it. He also feltthat he ought, as captain, to act as if he were a father to Terranova.<p><b>Questions to ask:</b><p><ul><li>Who is to blame for the woman's death?<li>Must the captain follow Chinese law in this case? If so, why?<li>If the captain decides not to follow Chinese law, how can he justify hisaction to himself?<li>What are the various options open to the captain?

<html><head><title>CES: Publications: Horace: 9-1: The Essential School Principal</title></head><body><hr><h1><center>The Essential School Principal: A Changing Role in a Changing School</center></h1><hr><center>Volume 9, Number 1     <br>September 1992</center><hr>                     When people talk about what Essential school principals do, I notice, they reach for metaphors from geometry, physics, architecture.  The principal must "up-end the pyramid," some say, supporting the school structure from below, not directing it from above. The principal serves as the "fulcrum of the change process," keeping a delicate balance between the often conflicting pressures coming from teachers, community, district, state.  The principal introduces a "blueprint for change," then adapts it continually in response to those who will have to live with it.<p>   The images are filled with tension and motion, conflicts and resolutions.  Strikingly, they mirror the very process Essential school classrooms hold dear--exploration, questioning, collaboration, reflection, risk-taking.  Even more strikingly, they contradict the traditional picture of the principal as strong-armed manager in a hierarchical system, the high-profile executive of excellence who keeps everyone else in line.<p>   Yet nobody describes the principal's position as comfortable; indeed, it is often a confusing one in these times of change.  Interviews with administrators from widely different Essential schools across the country bring out time and again the core dilemma Coalition principals share: how to reconcile strong leadership with the participatory decision-making that forms the bedrock of any sustained change effort.<p>   At universities and on school boards, among parents and politicians, convention calls for the good principal to lead the charge for reform within a school, waving the banner of change and bearing chief responsibility for victory or failure.  What happens when instead the principal gives up that prominence, investing substantial authority in teachers, parents, and students and backing up even their divergent decisions?  As teachers gain power, do principals lose it?<p>    Virtually every successful Essential school over the last eight years, say those who have watched the Coalition's growth, has depended on a strong and committed principal more than on any other single factor.  Yet the effectiveness of a principal in fostering reform, it seems, is best measured not by immediate results but by whether the changes survive the principal's term.<p>   In this regard, an effective principal must be much more than "keeper of the vision": she must foster a faculty capable of marshaling ITSELF to keep the vision and to go forward as a governance system.  As the school's intellectual conscience, as its resource for time and opportunities, as manager not of its product but its <i>process</i>, the principal carries the Essential School metaphor of "teacher as coach" to the administrative level--provoking, modeling, and nurturing the thoughtful growth everyone in a good school should experience.<p><hr><h2>The Definition Changes</h2><hr>Current discourse on principals and their role takes place in the context of the "effective schools" research of the past two decades, centered at the University of Wisconsin. The most effective schools, this research effort concluded, had in common a strong building principal.  Many school systems nationwide participated in Effective Schools training sessions aimed at strengthening the principal's skills and authority as an instructional leader.<p>   Researchers within the Coalition of Essential Schools argue, however, that the Effective Schools model is less well suited for schools moving away from the existing system.  They see that system as flawed, along with the convention of one strong leader it depends on.  Looking for a different framework, Coalition member schools have often turned to the 1986 report <i>A Nation Prepared:  Teachers for the 21st Century</i>, by the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy, which recommended moving toward teacher-centered school governance systems.<p>   Schools that have taken such a view, however, often cast principals onto uncertain ground.  Often left out of contract negotiations that give teachers substantial decision-making power, principals are nonetheless still legally accountable for what occurs in their schools.  They often feel caught between a hierarchical bureaucracy expecting efficiency and authoritative leadership and a ferment from below that requires a new style of leadership--open, unguarded, inclusive, and so regarded by such theorists as Sara Lawrence Lightfoot, author of <i>The Good High School</i> (Basic, 1983) as more "feminine" than the traditional patriarchal style.  (Interestingly, though only one-fifth of the nation's secondary school principals are women, among Coalition principals women number 35 percent.)<p>   A principal's authority, under such conditions, no longer derives from the organizational structure itself but directly from the teachers, who are becoming leaders themselves.  As decision-making power spreads out among the school community, new tensions inevitably arise.<p>   How far can a principal go in expressing his or her own strongly held values, for instance, without imposing them excessively on the school?  Can a principal sap teacher-driven changes of their strength simply by withholding strong support, thus encouraging others who are unwilling to participate?  In the end, aside from carrying out administrative, disciplinary, and bureaucratic chores, is a principal really necessary when decisions are shared among the staff?  Is a good principal these days charismatic or modest, a star or a <i>mensch</i>?  What does a good principal actually <i>do</i> in a successful Essential school?<p><hr><h2>Architect and Idea Person</h2><hr>"Principals now have to struggle between helping people see new possibilities and enabling them to decide whether they're going to go for the new possibilities," says Patricia Wasley of the Coalition's School Change Study, which provides analysis and feedback to principals and faculties in a few key schools working toward reform.  "They may come in as an architect does, with an initial vision--but then they have to be able to accommodate revisions to their notion.  If they can't do that, they haven't really learned to operate in new ways."<p>   Coalition principals show a range of styles in this area--from what might be called "dynamic centralism" to a completely consensual practice--and how quickly they push toward change may depend both on personality and on how deep they perceive their school's crisis to be.  At Chicago's Robeson High School, for instance, principal Jackie Simmons defends her decision to double the length of classroom periods despite a close faculty vote against it. <p>   "A high school generation of kids is only four years long; you want to provide the best you can as fast as you can," Simmons says.  "I had to decide between the best interests of the kids and paying attention to process alone, letting the teachers get there eventually."  After much back and forth with her teachers, Simmons modified her original proposal from 84-minute periods (on which the teacher's contract required a vote) to doubled-up 40-minute periods (which did not require approval). It was a risky move, she admits, though a subsequent grievance procedure upheld it; now, she says, even teachers once opposed praise the new schedule.  "For me, leadership means having the courage of your convictions," Simmons says, "being willing to risk everything, and getting teachers over the fear and rough edges.  This never would have happened if I had left it to teachers to hassle it out from ground zero."<p>   Sid Smith, principal of the 1,350-student Boston English High School, agrees.  "I cannot allow something to pass here that I will not stand up for and defend 100 percent to the world," he says.  Without faculty debate, for instance, Smith instituted "binding assessments" in several academic areas, without which a student may not graduate from Boston English.  But the assessments themselves were crafted by teacher committees, he points out.  "The final product in math looks different from what I'd like it to be," he says, "but that's an area where we'll go with the consensus decision."  Even so, he says, "When push comes to shove I reserve the right to make a decision that might not be endorsed by the majority of my staff."  Smith insisted, for example, that seniors taking the final year's assessment demonstrate mastery over all four years' math skills, though math teachers preferred to test them only on senior year coursework.<p>   Smith calls his approach a "dartboard methodology," in which he presents his ideas as a target and lets people throw criticisms and alternatives back at him. "Had the dartboard not been in place we wouldn't have come up with any hard change product that didn't exist before," he says.  "In the absence of a tangible product you'll never institutionalize anything.  When I came to Boston English I said that every student had to have a C average to participate in extracurricular activities.  Now it's a city standard."<p>   But other Coalition principals take a much different approach.  "Aside from certain issues like law and order, we may lose more than we gain when we bypass that important process of starting from the ground up and letting the change take hold systemically," says Sherry King, who was principal of 330-student Croton-Harmon High School in Westchester County, New York until she took the superintendent's job in her district this year. "You can say, ÔWe're going to have a different schedule where teachers work together,' but if you put a teacher into that schedule who is opposed and unprepared, my own experience is that you may get the opposite result."  <p>   Timing, King asserts, is everything, and she observes that the best leaders have an instinctive sense of when they can push teachers to a new level of constructive dissonance. "A principal needs a very sensitive barometer," she says, "to back down when the time isn't right, when people don't believe.  Teachers who don't believe will make a change not work."  Five years ago she would have pushed her teachers more quickly, King observes, toward her goal of having every student in the school take New York's state Regents exams, which finally occurred this year after King had put it off one last time because teachers were hesitant.  She prefers to err on the side of caution, she says, letting her staff take more time to question and reflect.  "Now they're pushing themselves," she exults.  "Five kids who never would have taken that test came within two points of passing--if we had been modestly more bold in waiving certain testing circumstances, they would have passed.  I thought it was a great victory, and my teachers thought it was a great defeat."<p>   Paul Schwarz, co-director with Deborah Meier of New York City's Central Park East Secondary School, is another who will not institute a change without full faculty approval.  "A principal can try to change minds, can fight, can bring in resources, can take time again and again to show the implications of a decision he disagrees with," he says.  "But the highest decision-making authority ought to be the school itself.  If teachers are making decisions absolutely at odds with your beliefs, you need to find another school."  In the end, Schwarz asserts, "it's not MY school.  It's OUR school, which is why teachers are willing to work extra long and hard so they can be proud of it.  It's the difference between a McDonald's and a mom-and-pop bodega."<p><hr><h2>Diagnostician, Goad, "Noodge"</h2><hr>One way principals lead people toward change is by continually asking teachers to analyze and reflect on how they teach.  "You're changing the way people think about their professional practice," says Paul Schwarz, "so you have to guard against regression.  If teachers start to teach the way they have been taught, not the way they've come to believe in teaching, they'll do things that need to be reflected back to them."  That role of "noodge," as Sherry King describes it, means the principal must be willing to confront people individually when she sees inconsistency in what they're doing.  How do the worksheets a teacher is using fit into the school's philosophy of student as worker?  What are the intellectual implications of the coursework planned for the coming semester?<p>   On a more public or collective level, the principal-diagnostician also makes sure that people continually re-commit to their involvement with Essential School principles.  Most Essential school principals interviewed here agreed that the school's original decision to join the Coalition was not up for grabs, at least under their leadership--but they felt compelled to keep examining its progress toward its professed goals.  If the goal is for every student to demonstrate competence in important intellectual tasks, the principal might ask teachers to reflect, for example, on how homogeneous ability grouping fits into that aim.<p>   What gets monitored by the principal, ideally, is not just classroom pedagogy and instruction but the very process of decision-making itself. "It's much more <i>process</i> management than <i>task</i> management," says principal Alan Dichter of New York City's Satellite Academy, a group of several small alternative schools.  (With Nancy Mohr, principal of University Heights High School in the Bronx, Dichter leads workshops for principals across the country.)  "Tasks may get decided somewhat collectively," he says, "but the best principals get their faculties to monitor and assess their own process, so they're not so dependent on any one leader to carry out the task of change."<p>   Robert Shirley, the headmaster of Heathwood Hall Episcopal School in Columbia, South Carolina, speaks eloquently about the tension that results when a principal begins that process.  A former Marine officer and banking executive, Shirley says he was well used to "a hierarchical authority structure dominated by white males" when he encountered the ideas of both Theodore Sizer and Carol Gilligan in a weekend seminar a decade ago.  Working toward shared decision-making at Heathwood Hall, he recalls, was uncomfortable for everyone involved.  "Just as in an organic body," he says, "all kinds of two-way signals get passed back and forth between every member of the system and the head. Just as much may go on with teachers' abdicating power as with the central person's seizing it." Change must happen, Shirley says, "in the nooks and crannies" of those subtle communications.  "But it will only be operating as a synergistic thing when the organization itself realizes that it is happening."<p>   Marilyn Hohmann, the principal of Fairdale High School in Jefferson County, Kentucky, is widely considered a master of this synergy.  "You've got to realize that people learn in different ways and at different speeds," she says. "I never let anybody--even the most intense resisters--depart or withdraw from the process of sharing these decisions. I make them constantly respond, even if they constantly respond in the negative.  It takes tremendous persistence, patience, even a willingness to accept unprofessional conduct at times; but it has to be that way if we're going to get people truly to believe it's okay to take risks.  Some of our staff really do see changes like de-tracking as a lessening of rigor compared to what they have always done."<p>   Once a program is in place at Fairdale, it receives regular critical attention.  "We never pilot anything for less than a year," Hohmann says.  "Then we start analyzing and evaluating it, asking what measures were effective, what we have learned, whether we should continue." <p><hr><h2>A Leader of Leaders</h2><hr>Though these principals represent a range of styles, all of them emphasize the need to distribute authority, to trust their staffs to use it well, and to facilitate the conflicts that arise when decisions are shared.  Chuck Bowen was hired as principal of Broadmoor Junior High School in Pekin, Illinois after having worked there as an outside facilitator when the school joined the state's Re:Learning initiative.  "The principal's job is to guide the learning process about how organizations make decisions," he says, "until you've all come to an understanding of how this school makes its decisions."<p>   At Broadmoor, that now includes four broad rules that govern administrators, staff, and parents:<p><ul>     <li>You must participate in decisions that affect you.     <li> You can't make decisions that affect someone else without         involving them.     <li> Everyone who participates in a decision lives with it until the         decision is reversed together.     <li>You are responsible for the effects of your decision, so it is         your job to make sure it works or together unmake and improve         the decision.</ul><p>   "When our school reorganized into teams, for example, everyone was affected so everyone was involved in the decision," Bowen says.  "The emotional impact of the decision was potentially great, so we decided to do it only if everyone could live with it.  Once we made the decision, we all decided how to make it work by helping the school board, the central office, and the community understand it.  And when flak came our way, the whole school responded--the entire staff showed up at a school board meeting not out of a sense of crisis but just to make sure their questions were answered."<p>   Bowen calls this system "distributed decision making"; its first step, he says, is deciding which decisions belong to classroom teachers, which to teams, which to administrators, which to the school as a whole, and which involve the community.  "My job is to monitor not only the process but the content of the process," he says. "I make sure we're talking about important things, so people don't get bogged down talking about pencil sharpeners and heating systems."<p>   "Teachers make a lot of decisions in schools whether you want them to or not," Bowen observes.  "Why not organize the school to take advantage of that rather than suppress it?"<p>   What if conflict divides the decision-making body?  "The principal has to coach people to participate in conflict in a way that isn't personally damaging," Patricia Wasley observes.  "Feeling conflicted is an essential part of learning, for both adults and kids.  The principal must keep pushing people to be open about their various viewpoints; otherwise the faculty becomes subversive."<p>   "You watch a lot of people take a lot of heat, and it isn't easy," says Marilyn Hohmann.  "You have to quietly support them, keep a low profile, exercise minimal oversight of meetings--but provide as much as possible in the way of a support system, both external and internal."<p>   And what if the final decision goes against the principal's own convictions?  "Trust the process," says CES's Director for Schools, Bob McCarthy, who himself has headed high schools in Hanover, New Hampshire and Brookline, Massachusetts.  "If the decision-making roles have been clearly defined, go ahead with it even if you disagree.  There's rarely any one decision that can make or break a school."<p>   From central office to school board, the school hierarchy must also abandon a knee-jerk support for what the principal wants.  "At a board meeting where a significant decision must be made, the best principals have the presentation made by teachers, students and parents," McCarthy says. "It's a courageous thing to do in a system that is used to high-profile leaders."<p>   But the more powerful the system a principal heads, Alan Dichter observes, the more its leader is perceived as strong.  "And if the decision is not his to make," he says, "the principal is actually in a much better position to make his own views known in a strong and forthright way."  Delegating power for important decisions makes the principal a leader of leaders, Dichter and Nancy Mohr believe.  It creates not an "authorizing culture"-- where the leader gives people "official permission" to do things and then holds them accountable--but an "empowering culture," where meaningful involvement is an obligation and all involved develop the ability to participate.<p>   In Chicago, where local school councils now govern all public schools, Jackie Simmons sees a striking change in the school climate since her staff has developed expertise in important administrative matters.  "We have nine Ôdesign teams' that handle areas like professional development and staff selection," she says.  "Ad hoc training sessions continually spring up, where teachers help each other learn new things.  And at a city-wide job fair attended by 4,000 teachers last week, we were the only school that had a team of teachers, not a lone principal, interviewing applicants for the four positions we had available."<p><hr><h2>The Principal as Teacher</h2><hr>It seems natural, given all this, that many Essential school principals speak of their role as teachers, in the sense that they coach their faculty to think independently, learn continually, take intellectual risks.  "Like a good teacher, your job is to motivate, to lead, to create an environment where people can best work," says Central Park East's Paul Schwarz, who (like his co-director Deborah Meier) taught kindergarten for twenty years and believes the experience shaped his vision of school leadership.  "You can't impose reading on children, for instance--you have to let them discover at their own pace how wonderful it is."<p>   The very process of participatory management, for example, provokes teachers to learn new skills.  "Our folks never dreamed that learning to use Edward Deming's model of shared decision making would teach them how to use data so well," says Marilyn Hohmann.  "Now they do all kinds of statistical analysis--they not only use it for charting student improvement and attendance, but they can also teach kids to use quantitative reasoning in academic areas."<p>   Learning what works in education is part of a teacher's education when power is shared.  "Teachers need access to a tremendous amount of facts when you ask them to make decisions about important issues like de-tracking," Hohmann observes. "It can be a real learning experience, and my responsibility is to make sure they know what they need to know."<p>   Even more important, several principals noted, sharing responsibility for school decisions helps teachers learn how to cooperate on joint learning ventures, which translates directly into classroom expertise on cooperative learning.  "Secondary schools, unlike elementary schools, have traditionally been very isolating places for teachers," says Hohmann.  "The most difficult task we face is learning to work together."<p>   One reward when teachers do that, say principals, is a new sense that their jobs offer continual personal and professional growth.  "I try to foster an ethic in which teachers transcend the limitations of their role," says Larry Myatt, who heads Fenway Middle College, an alternative Boston high school. "They're not just teaching four classes and guarding the cafeteria--they're supervising internships, working as peer mentors to new teachers, researching new curricula, reporting to each other on visits they make to other schools."  Raising the level of the school's internal discourse, Myatt says, is a key part of his job: "Every day there is something in teachers' boxes about research, pedagogy, learning, assessment."<p>   Several principals spoke similarly of their role as support person for the classroom teachers, clarifying issues and gathering resources so that teaching, learning, and decision making might go better.  "My job as a leader is to stay at the cutting edge of things in education, and to make sure teachers see things, hear them, and talk about them," says Jackie Simmons.  "I arranged a computerized network throughout our building, for instance, so that any teacher anywhere can use software in an interdisciplinary way."<p><hr><h2>Record-Keeper, Point Person</h2><hr>Provoking a rich conversation about contemporary practices, several observers note, is one of the most important functions of an Essential school principal.  But a key adjunct, as in any community of researchers, is to document and analyze the results of the changes a school adopts.<p>   "I encourage teachers to write up and record what they do, so we can share it with other people," says Lenora Hay, principal of Brown School in Jefferson County, Kentucky.  "It takes time and space, but I feel a commitment to doing it."  A prime example of this takes place at Pasadena High School, where principal Judy Codding obtained a grant to follow every entering ninth-grader's progress through graduation and beyond.<p>   The natural extension of this practice takes the principal into the community to talk about the school's changing values and practices.  "We have a larger role in the district, the state, even the nation," says Larry Myatt, who admits that joining the public discourse can be "a fearsome thing" at first.  "I agree with Ted Sizer that if we don't make these choices, people will make them for us--things like national testing will be imposed on us simplistically, adding another debilitating layer to the problems that already exist.  Principals have to forsake just writing in our journals and get out to talk about our ideas with parents, business people, legislators, anyone who will listen."<p>   Such a public presence, naturally, invites public criticism as well, and these principals are well aware of their own accountability for change in their schools.  "When I don't sleep," Sherry King confides, "is when I encourage people to take these risks and I just don't know for sure if it's the best thing for the kids.  I don't ever remember feeling as anxious as I did the day of those Regents exams.  It's like giving birth--you pace the floor, asking whether it's fair to ask kids to take the test if they might not pass, whether you've thought through all the consequences.  In the end, if you're worth your salt the buck stops with you, not with the teacher who's gone out on a limb."<p><hr><h2>What Do Principals Need?</h2><hr>Given such daunting new demands, what kind of preparation and support do Essential school principals need?  Conventional principal-certification programs generally focus more on school law, facilities management, statistical skills, and personnel policies than on the new challenges that face principals in times of change.  Unless the Coalition itself were to establish a certification program--a move strongly urged by one of its charter principals, Dennis Littky--principals will get little training in shared leadership as they climb the traditional ladder to the school's top job.<p>   "When you have a whole new climate in your district, you have to look within the system for your leaders," says Superintendent Jerry Parker in Pekin, Illinois, where he chose Chuck Bowen to head Broadmoor Junior High. "We're establishing a program to recruit and mentor those teachers we think have promise as administrators.  They'll still have to jump through the state's hoops, but we'll help them come out of the licensing process with the skills we're looking for."  Parker has begun teaching a monthly class in his office for teachers interested in moving up, and he continually scouts for possible new enrollees.  "Some of the best leaders didn't start out thinking they would end up in administration," he says.<p>   "There is an ambivalence among teachers in progressive education about the principal's position," says Paul Schwarz.  "Many see administrators as bosses and bureaucrats, number-crunchers who have gone over to the other side.  The Coalition needs to show our best teachers a different kind of power--to convince our best teachers that being a wonderful principal or administrator is an honorable thing to do in our profession."<p>   In fact, the Coalition's National Re:Learning Faculty program includes just that aim.  Besides naming some 20 teachers each year as Citibank Faculty to coach their peers in new ways, the program also names about a dozen Thomson Fellows from the ranks of Essential school principals.  Fellows meet regularly for seminars and workshops in Essential school leadership, and they provide for each other the peer fellowship and "critical friends" that principals commonly lack.<p>   Other principals turn to their own community for support and training, sometimes through unconventional channels.  Lenora Hay has joined a group of Kentucky women in school administration, many of whom have come to their positions very recently and through nontraditional paths.  "Because I was a curriculum coordinator before, where I had to rely more on friendly persuasion than on power, I haven't had to unlearn previous habits," Hay says.  "Also, I think there may be more of a natural bent among women toward collaboration."<p>   Some principals have asked local corporations to include them in executive leadership seminars, which often focus on shared decision making.  In other districts, professional development centers like Jefferson County's Gheens Academy provide a forum for growth and training.  Still other schools, such as Central Park East, choose to divide the top position between two or more people.  "Every school ought to have two principals, maybe instead of a principal and an assistant principal," says Paul Schwarz.  "When really tough judgment calls arise, two people make them better than one."<p>   From their districts and their state education offices, these principals ask for a constant environment that encourages change.  "Re:Learning as an idea is centered on creating that environment Ôfrom schoolhouse to statehouse,'" says Illinois principal Chuck Bowen, "but it needs to focus even more on the district   level."  Symbols like pay and access to higher-ups are also important to principals as leadership roles shift.  In Jefferson County, Kentucky, superintendent Don Ingwerson eliminated a hefty number of middle-level district administrators, giving his principals more access to system-wide services and asking them to report difficulties directly to him.<p><hr><h2>What Is a Principal's Power?</h2><hr> As the roles of Essential school principals change, the ways they perceive their own power change too, and so do their attitudes toward those they lead.  "Real power is the ability to say <i>yes</i>," says Jackie Simmons.  "People come to you with ideas, and you can help them.  Sometimes you can best help by offering a creative alternative, keeping the person moving in a positive direction at the same time you preserve the relationship.  My teachers laugh at me because I'm always Ômaking them an offer they can't refuse'--but if I do, I try to make it really a better idea."<p>   How do principals harness the power of those they lead, ask Nancy Mohr and Alan Dichter, if not by directing it from the top down?  "By recognizing that Ôindependence' is not the goal but a mid-point," they write.  "We must strive to create an interdependent community, where these self-reliant and independent citizens understand the greater potential that interdependence offers."  So the principal, they say, can help the school community become more than the sum of its parts.  Power indeed, as Mohr points out--but not a dirty word.<p>   "Sure, this could all be done so much more quickly and easily," says Marilyn Hohmann.  "You could just say "Do it" and it would be done.  Thank God I have a long, narrow office--I can't tell you how many times I have started out of here intending to do just that, and changed my mind before I got out the door."  It takes longer to achieve change when you redefine the principal's role, Hohmann acknowledges.  "But by God, the change takes--just like an immunization.  There was no way of ever telling <i>what</i> took, back when people just did what they were told."<p>   Only when principals share school leadership, Hohmann argues, can a true community of learning exist, where every member learns and also teaches.  "Kentucky takes so many of our school's great teachers to lead others in the reform effort," she says.  "We <i>have</i> to replace them as leaders with other teachers.  For that you need a climate where people can risk trying new things, and the principal has to start it.  What we're doing, all of us, is teaching and learning.  They're inseparable, an endless wheel."<p>   Like all great teachers, Hohmann lives out her  convictions with such authenticity and strength that many who work with her choose ultimately to shape their own practices after those beliefs as well. In the end, Theodore Sizer observes, that quality may serve a principal better than any other. "It takes a different kind of leader to lead a school that's going to change," he says . "It requires a person whocan truly be PRIMUS INTER PARES--the first among equals--carrying the authority of the principal teacher, born of conviction and experience." More sharply than most in the engine of Essential school change, principals may feel the friction Hohmann's "endless wheel" creates.  But they seem bent on transforming the energy that results, and perhaps transforming themselves into the bargain.  <p>                                    <hr>                <h2> Principals As Coaches: The Thomson Fellowships</h2><hr>Many of the principals quoted in this issue, though not all, have been named Thomson Fellows by the Coalition of Essential Schools, under the aegis of an ambitious professional development project called the National Re:Learning Faculty.<p>   The Re:Learning Faculty may be best known for its Citibank Faculty, experienced teachers who work closely with colleagues in their own Essential schools and others nearby.  (Sixty Citibank Faculty members have been selected since 1990, including 24 for 1992-93.)  But the project also has two other tiers: one which includes district administrators, school board members, and community representatives; and the Thomson Fellows program, which seeks to develop and deepen the leadership skills of twelve to fifteen Essential school principals each year.<p>   As Fellows, principals come to planning seminars and workshops held at Brown University--an intensely focused setting, the Coalition believes, that plays a key part in their examining the complicated issues of Essential School leadership.  Crucial to these sessions is their interaction with the Citibank Faculty who are brought to Brown for similar and often entwined experiences.<p>   For example, principals and teachers might work together on matters such as conflict resolution, strategies for professional development and for consulting with faculty members, teaming, school scheduling, and other common challenges that confront schools in the midst of change.<p>   Each Thomson Fellow then establishes a intensive consulting relationship with one or two schools in his or her geographic area--either Essential schools or those who are still in Re:Learning's early stage of "networking."  In some cases a Citibank Faculty member and a Thomson Fellow work as a team with one school. Serving as "critical friends," the Coalition hopes, the principals will bring insight and support as schools venture upon important pedagogical and structural change.<p>   "We are not evaluators of any sort," program administrators emphasize.  "We are concerned colleagues who are willing to be involved in difficult discussions about how to best improve our schools."  For seven or more working days during the school year, each Fellow will help gather resources, identify roadblocks to change, and establish important connections outside the school's normal channels.  Thomson Fellows, like Citibank Faculty, only go to schools upon invitation by a significant number of the school faculty and administration.<p>   Thomson Fellowships are named after Scott Thomson, the former executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and funded by a grant from the Danforth Foundation.  All expenses are paid for the fellows' spring planning meeting and ten-day summer institute, and fellows are also provided a modest stipend.  The deadline for applying for Thomson Fellowships is in December; more information can be obtained by writing Paula Evans or Mary Hibert at the Coalition of Essential Schools or calling (401) 863-3473.  <p><hr>                 <h2>            Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or coming editions.

On this most volatile and emotional issue in Americansecondary education, the chairman of the Coalition of Essential Schools surelydoes not equivocate. Heterogeneous grouping--mixing students of different abilitylevels in academic classes, instead of streaming them with like peers in trackstoward class-born and race-sorted futures--is central to the Coalition's vision,I always thought.  Doesn't it fit right into those "universal goals for everystudent," that "personalized education" CES's Nine Common Principles call for?I wait for the other shoe to drop, but not for long. "Just give me as manytracks as there are kids," Sizer finishes with a grin.<p>   Beneath his joke, though, is a dead serious challenge to the teachers,parents, students, and communities of Coalition member schools.  A 1982 researchanalysis by James and Chen-Li Kulik found no evidence that students learn morewhen grouped by ability; at lower skill levels, a 1986 study shows, studentsactually learn LESS. Teachers set higher goals, like critical thought andindependent learning, for higher-track students, and focus more on disciplineand conformity in lower-track classes, the nationwide Study of Schoolingrevealed. Legal challenges to tracking over the last 25 years have argued itssegregative aspects: substantially higher percentages of African-American andHispanic students are placed in lower-track courses, statistics show. Moreover,homogeneous grouping may deprive students at all levels of skills essential fortheir future success. If we want citizens who take an active and thoughtful partin our democracy, Sizer argues, they must get trained for this in school--workingtogether on equally challenging problems, and using every possible talent towardtheir solutions.<p>   Yet few educational issues raise so many hackles as heterogeneous grouping,especially in the secondary school. The most vocal opposition to mixed-abilityclasses typically comes from the parents and teachers of high-achievingstudents, who fear classes will become less challenging as they accommodate thelearning needs of those less well prepared.  But teachers at all levels worryabout de-tracking.  Getting students of different levels to work together wellimplies new teaching methods and sometimes entirely new curricula, they say--andthat requires time, practice, and freedom from teacher evaluation proceduresgeared to the old ways.<p>   Tracking itself takes different forms at different schools. Some systems keepkids on an unvarying path labeled "honors," "college prep," "general ed," or"special ed"; others group students by ability only in certain subjects likemath and English.  Others simply set up sequential courses by department, andlimit who takes them so that a form of <i>de facto</i> tracking results.  Who makes thedecision about what courses a student takes also is key to a school's stance;many kids in low-track courses, encouraged by well-meaning advisers, actuallythink they are taking college prep courses.<p>   Whichever form of ability grouping a school has employed, the decision to de-track requires a rethinking so fundamental as to upset almost every apple cartin the place. Moreover, schools in the midst of change can find as many ways tomix students together as they once had ways to separate them.  How can Essentialschools stimulate the highest caliber work at every level, respecting thesequential nature of some areas of learning and yet generating a sharedintellectual discourse among all students?  In conversations with Essentialschool people at various stages of this process, a range of approaches emerges--ingenious, cautious, bold--that displays on yet another palette just how broadthe Coalition's spectrum has become, and just how many challenges its schoolsface as they change.<p><hr><h2>New Structures Can Help</h2><hr>"If every child is to be taken as herself," Ted Sizer says, "teachers have toknow where that kid's head and heart is--which implies a smaller student load perteacher.  At the same time teachers will need the maximum authority to adjustclass time, materials, and pedagogy so they can help her move ahead." Whenschools are small enough, he argues, and their structures simple enough,teachers can remain quite flexible in how they challenge individual students."Schools could learn from the best athletic and drama coaches," he says, "how toplan and regroup from day to day, based on where the kids are and what they needto exercise their minds."<p>   In practice, this often entails breaking a large high school into smaller"houses," and teaming teachers across disciplines to get their student loadsdown. At Boston English High School, for instance, the 400 students in theMulticultural Program represent "as diverse a mix as that of the whole school,"says its director, Susan Fleming. Bilingual students in a host of languagesstudy the same curriculum as "regular ed" students in classrooms next door toeach other; they mingle for many program-wide activities; and, like all BostonEnglish students, they are grouped across ability levels for history andscience, but not math and English.Õ   Team teaching can be a powerful structural tool for making heterogeneousgrouping work. At Thayer Junior/Senior High School, a small public school inWinchester, New Hampshire, a team of three teachers works with each grade levelmixing students of all achievement levels. The result is a deemphasis on theladder of sequential courses most schools employ to sort and select theirstudents.  "Kids lose track of the sense that they're 'in class,'" commentsCoalition researcher Joseph McDonald. "They're 'in team'--which means they can beproductively at work in other parts of the building, on meaningful projects thataren't limited by time and space."  This works best, he notes, in a small schoollike Thayer, where it's easier to keep track of kids' physical whereabouts.<p>   Another structural choice simplifies the curriculum into a few broad areas ofinquiry, abandoning the course as organizing unit and arranging intellectualendeavors around themes or projects that include a range of students.  In arecent six-week unit at McCaskey High School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, forexample, 170 tenth-grade students and eight teachers took up the task ofconstructing a public defense (against invading aliens) for the continuation oflife on Earth. They meet daily in an unstructured five-period block, integratingwork in social studies, math, science, and communication arts.<p>   "The raw material for the defense was produced by small groups--some ability-grouped, some not--studying specific content matter from those four subjectareas," says Dan McGary, a curriculum supervisor for the district office. "Thenmixed groups of students processed what came out of that, integrating it intothe defense statement." Overall, McGary says, the school's goal is to givestudents a mix of experiences--some subject-oriented, others aimed at solvingproblems, but all organized around authentic intellectual experiences. "Certainactivities--worksheets or cookbook kinds of labs--have traditionally beenassociated with lower ability levels," he says. "We want to eliminate thoseunchallenging routines for all students."<p>   Project-based curricula have the advantage of requiring a variety of skillsfrom students, not just the narrow competencies (like verbal deftness or mathacuity) that have traditionally defined children as gifted or slow. "I've foundthat a kid who's great in math is often not so good at interviewing, writing, orgroup skills," says Suzanne Valenza, who teaches cross-disciplinary courses atUniversity Heights High School, a New York City alternative public school."Working on a group project, he realizes that everything's connected--which helpshim stop ignoring the areas he's less good at and get his act together."  Inthat sense, she argues, separating kids by ability actually keeps the most ablestudent from achieving to full capacity.<p>   If schools decide to regard projects as the basic learning unit, however,they must design time and space into their structures to encourage such work.Art or music studios, labs, workshops, computer centers can all become placeswhere kids can come in during free or scheduled time and work on a project overtime. Harvard University professor Howard Gardner makes a strong argument forthe educational worth of such projects in his 1989 book <i>To Open Minds. </i>Amongother things, he suggests long-term apprenticeships that expand a student'slearning options and nurture her idiosyncratic intelligence through some valuedcommunity activity. In China, Gardner notes, "students work on a day-to-daybasis with acknowledged masters in a domain, and not only learn to hone theirskills through regular drill in a meaningful context but also acquire sense ofhow to deploy knowledge outside formal schooling."<p>   Age-grouping of students is another false convention, Ted Sizer asserts."Schools set it up so that Susie goes in this track because she's 14 years oldand can do X, Y, and Z," he says. "Ideally, we should continually reshufflestudents of different ages into appropriate learning groups as they reach thelevel of skill required."  Some elementary schools follow such a pattern underthe Joplin Plan (better known in the 1960s than today), which groups children byreading levels into cross-age classes mingling high with low achievers. (Thisgoes far, its proponents assert, to thwart the sense of failure that often dogslower ability-ranked classes, a self-perpetuating cycle often linked to racialand class prejudice.) Another example comes from the Crefeld School, a privateEssential school in Philadelphia where students ages 12 to 18 mingle freely intwo ungraded groups, loosely organized as an upper school and a middle school.<p>   The effects of eliminating age-grading are noticeable, Coalition stafferssay, at Brown University's Summer High School. Besides bringing togetherstudents from public and private schools, rich and poor backgrounds, and manyprior skill levels, the classes also mix all different ages, from eighth toeleventh graders.  Somehow, observers say, this age diversity has an importantinfluence on how readily the students accept the rest of the variations amongthem. Working within a narrow age band seems only to emphasize all otherdifferences, to ill effect.<p><hr><h2>Strategies for Mixing Abilities</h2><hr>What teaching methods work best in mixed-ability classrooms?  How can studentsof widely various skill levels encounter the same demanding materials, explorethem to the limits of their abilities, and enrich each other's experience withthe special talents each one brings to class?  Particularly, how can the top tenpercent of students, on whose behalf much of the fuss is raised, be pushed aheadinstead of dragged down by the heterogeneous learning group?<p>   One common solution is the classroom practice known as "cooperativelearning," or "collaborative learning," which has enjoyed wide vogue in the lastdecade.  In the Boston English "global issues" courseSusan Fleming team-teacheswith two other administrators, for example, 34 tenth to twelfth graders work insmall groups on the same reading and writing assignments. More able kids willinspire and lead the slower ones, the cooperative-learning theory has it, andevery student will contribute his or her own particular strength and flavor tothe learning stew.<p>   "We give them pretty challenging material," Fleming says. "They read ittogether, identifying the major points in each article; then they quiz eachother on the content. Each kid will get one question to answer on the quiz, butthe group is graded for its whole performance, so there's incentive to geteveryone up to speed."  Choosing complex and interesting topics likeimmigration, she says, ensures that even the most able students face realintellectual challenges. On the written position papers they complete each term,each may write at a different level, but all are facing the same task, "There'sa lot of interdependency among the students," Fleming says. "It's not easystuff, and everyone brings something to contribute."<p>   Does coverage of content suffer when teachers emphasize group work like this?In an article published in Thayer High School's publication "Here, Thayer, andEverywhere," tenth-grade math teacher Elizabeth Whitcomb has described herconsternation at the thought of teaching geometry to those who might not beprepared for it, and her gradual "conversion" to a strong preference for mixed-ability classes, at least at that level.<p>   "My goal was that all students would not only be reached, but alsochallenged, often beyond self-imposed limits," Whitcomb writes. "I also wantedthem to know that true mathematics could be done at all levels."  She combedsource materials for problems that could be explored at several differentmathematical levels--finding the shortest path between three points on ariverbank, for instance--and encouraged students to go as far with them as theycould. "While some students may not have realized the wide range of applicationsat first," she writes, "they were able to appreciate and understand them onceother students made the discoveries."<p>   Whitcomb's students often work in twos and threes, with more advancedstudents coaching others in necessary concepts. On many assignments, she offersa more challenging version along with the basic problem; anyone can try it forextra credit, but there is no penalty if one doesn't. She also asks students tothink through each week, in written journals, an "unsolvable" problem from theirweek's work, and to try to discern and analyze what made it hard.  "As the yearproceeded the journals provided the heterogeneous classroom with something veryvital," Whitcomb writes, "an activity which everyone could do and from whicheveryone could gain according to his own level."<p>   Such strategies are common in mixed-ability situations, and Whitcomb is amongmany Essential school teachers who say that students work harder and do betterwhen they take part in them. Holly Perry, a Thomson Fellow and principal ofPhiladelphia's Academy for the Middle Years, a public middle school, describeswhat happened when her school decided to offer Algebra 1 to all eighth graders,including a special ed teacher as part of the teaching team. "One of our topalgebra students right now is a special ed kid with a reading and mathdisability," she says. "I think it's really a matter of confidence. There are somany levels of hurt for youngsters who are set apart that it actually gets inthe way of cognitive progress."<p>   Early intervention when a student is dropping behind in a heterogeneous classis critical, teachers agree--which is one reason a small and flexible schoolstructure is so important to its success. "When a student needs remediation, wework with the problem right there at the time," says Jo Stokes, a McCaskey mathteacher with a heterogeneous Algebra 2 class. "We have a full advisory perioddaily to give students extra help, and we have college students come in from thelocal university to tutor kids."<p>   Another key factor is support from other teachers--in planning lessons thatcan challenge all students, in identifying kids who need extra attention, and incooperating so they can get it without delay.  Many teachers who worksuccessfully with mixed groups team up with special ed resource teachers oraides, student teachers, interns, or parent helpers. The key, say those who doit, is to make such help freely available to <i>all</i> kids in the class, so as toremove any stigma attached to special ed or extra help.<p>   Finally, classroom management skills can make or break the mixed-abilityclass, Susan Fleming notes. "You can't change your teaching strategies unlessyou have your classroom management down," she says. "You have to be clear onwhat needs to be done, and there has to be some kind of accountability at theend of class--ten minutes or so to pull in and report back. It's a messybusiness, and it's not that easy.  The people it works for the best seem to havetheir kids 'on task' all the time."<p><hr><h2>Seminars and Mixed Groups</h2><hr>Seminars provide another practical strategy for drawing students of differentskill levels together in challenging classes.  At Chicago's Sullivan HighSchool, for instance, every student in the school participates in weeklyseminars in English and history, monthly seminars in sciences, and occasionalones in subjects like math and languages. The entire faculty and staff have beentrained to lead seminars, and periodically the whole school gathers forenrichment or special-topic seminars.<p>   The practical effect, seminar advocates argue, is twofold. Students all readthe same work--at Sullivan, a demanding mix of classics and contemporary authors--and so share in the same intellectual ground of ideas.  And the excitement andcontroversy generated by those ideas provides the stimulus to go back and masterthe necessary skills to explore them further.<p>   Some schools go to great lengths to make sure the actual text of, say,Romeo_and_Juliet is read by all ninth graders; others tailor the experience toskill levels by reading Charles and Mary Lamb's retelling, for instance, or byseeing the play in performance or on film.  At Sullivan everyone reads theoriginal text, but reading tutors are available to work with students ondifficult texts--a practice that, to work, requires the commitment of space andout-of-class time.<p>   Seminar-style discussions often draw out the best from less advantagedstudents whose life experience can amplify their classmates' understanding oftexts. "Kids with street smarts may be in some ways actually better prepared todeal with ambiguity, to make inferences, and to approach a subject fromdifferent points of view than are kids who have been trained in a 'right answer'mentality," says Ann Cook, who co-directs New York City's Urban Academy, a smallpublic alternative school. "Just because you come from a middle-classenvironment doesn't mean you're more analytical--you may just be more verbose!"<p>   Some seminars draw a number of sources together to answer "essentialquestions" like "What is power?"  Others, notably Socratic seminars, focusaround interpreting specific texts. In either case, seminars serve to organize acourse's desired learning outcomes--reading, writing, comparing, analyzing,summarizing, and so forth--without undue emphasis on every student's having thesame skills.  A seminar can easily be followed by work in small groups onspecific content areas, or by a writing assignment to develop the ideas underdiscussion, or by a project that requires other kinds of mastery, likeinterviewing or data collection.<p>   Sullivan High School tries to follow Mortimer Adler's "three-column" teachingphilosophy--combining the Socratic method for "understanding," small-group orindividual coaching for skill development, and presentation-style instructionfor gaining information.  The approach is reflected even in the school'sphysical arrangement of classrooms, which often have small adjacent rooms wherestudents can work either unsupervised, with a computer, or with a tutor.New York's Urban Academy arrived at a similar teaching method, says Ann Cook,after seeing the trouble seniors ran into when they took classes at two localcolleges the school has links with. "One of our faculty went along and sat in onthe classes to see where the difficulties lay," Cook says. "Very often the kidsjust needed a clearer articulation of the demands of the course, or some helpwith structuring their time and study skills." After getting such coaching backat school, Urban's seniors started to do much better; and soon the schoolincorporated the same technique into its own curriculum. One teacher leads adiscussion class; another teacher sits in on that class and then runs a "labclass" to work on some of the issues of process--organizing evidence,categorizing, thinking through arguments.<p>   "We're putting kids into a demanding academic situation and then helping themto achieve what is expected," Cook says. "The skills of reading, writing, andcritical analysis are then supported at the point where they are needed, as aresult of the demands of the course."<p>   Even students who come to Urban Academy from academically selective highschools have little experience in inquiry and critical thinking, Cook says--sothe heterogeneous ability group all has the same intellectual task to face. Theschool addresses skill differences by creating courses where the intellectualquestions are common to a variety of sources. "We have a course called 'Novels,'for example, where the central question is what makes good writing," she says."Or we look at Columbus from a historiographical point of view--using primarysources, textbooks, children's books, or just what students already know fromgrowing up in America. We ask, 'Is Columbus who we think he is, and how do weknow?'"  We're not looking for a lower level of intellectual inquiry, but forways to push everybody to do more.  We're looking for equal access to theinteresting questions."<p><hr><h2>Can Everyone Be Gifted?</h2><hr>Equal access lies, in fact, at the heart of the ability-grouping issue. "Theschool's job is to open the door as wide as possible to every student," says TedSizer.  In its second year of heterogeneous grouping, Hodgson Vo-Tech HighSchool in Newark, Delaware has all its ninth graders take biology, then letsthem choose between two equally demanding science courses (chemistry andprinciples of technology), depending on their field of interest. "Now that kidsknow they've all got to do it, they see themselves as capable of morechallenging things," says guidance counselor Joann Miro. "We just won nineawards in the statewide Science Olympiad, where two years ago we never evenentered it!"<p>   Some schools continue ability-grouped courses because of pressures from thecommunity, but insist that students be allowed to enroll in any course they arewilling to try. At one Coalition member school serving a well-to-do area in alarge Southern city, the principal spoke frankly about the results. "We're alltrying to do things that eliminate dropouts," he said. "If we can make studentsfeel successful and not give up, that is the point. We allow students to make achoice, but we don't generate the heterogeneous groupings ourselves.  It's likediving--I know how high a board I can dive from, and I'm not going up anyhigher."  Critics assail such systems as subtly perpetuating class and racialbarriers to achievement.  But this principal disagrees; his school encouragesstudents to move up on their own, he says, by using exhibitions and performanceassessments so that students afraid they won't do well on conventional testingmeasures will make bold to try more demanding courses.<p>   Even if the state requires its schools to provide programs for "gifted"children, as in Georgia, those who believe in heterogeneous grouping still findways to put it in place. Salem High School, a new Coalition public school twentymiles outside Atlanta, uses eighth-grade "teacher ratings" on new ninth graders'records to carefully (and confidentially) balance each of their three ninth-grade teams for mixed ability levels.  The school then opens its "honorscurriculum" to any student who will contract to meet its standards.<p>   "To qualify, a student has to come up with an open-ended critical question intwo subject areas, for each of two consecutive quarters," says Marilyn Fifield,a social studies teacher who helped devise the honors program. "I have a studentthis quarter who is analyzing why our county grew the way it did over the last20 years; next quarter she'll do a multimedia presentation projecting growthtrends over the next 20 years, interviewing all kinds of city officials." Afaculty mentor guides the progress of each project and a three-member panel ofteachers assesses it on completion; the work must receive a C or better toappear as an honors grade on the student's transcript. The system allows a ten-day grace period after signup, during which students may change their minds.<p>   "We've seen students who were not even labeled as high average taking up thechallenge," says Fifield. "And the gifted students, who so often get channeledinto narrowly academic areas, get to go beyond the borders of school into thecommunity and university. One student who does lawn service work during thesummer proposed a project on setting up a small business; a young cellist iscreating a hybrid instrument from the blueprint stage, experimenting withchanging its tone. This gets them to see that the ability to go beyond theaverage can be a practical and satisfying skill."  Concerned about whether thestudents were getting what they needed academically, Fifield says, the committeereviewed the Advanced Placement exams; they found many of the same questionstheir students had spontaneously chosen to research.<p><hr><h2>Setting High Standards</h2><hr>The question of standards vexes many who worry that heterogeneous grouping willlower the value of a high-achieving student's education. Conventional testingmeasures do not support this: aggregate data comparing tracked with untrackedstudents show no significant difference between the two groups in studentachievement levels on standardized tests. Once they are tracked, however, low-tracked students do score more poorly than their high-tracked peers. (Some scoffthat high achievers do well on standardized tests even if they sleep throughschool, however.) Advocates of mixed groups argue that authentic assessmentactually sets higher standards for all students--measuring not just facts amassedbut the ability to reason logically, read and write thoughtfully, and solveproblems that have no one right answer. Rather than watering down academicstandards, Ted Sizer argues, we must raise them, even for the highest-achievingstudents--and that will require a thoughtful rethinking of how and what we teach,and how we measure success.<p>   Even more important, setting the same goals for all students can create aschool culture where intellectual energy is the rule rather than the exception.This carries over into classroom behavior as well; one study by Frances Schwartzreveals not only higher academic standards in top tracks but also markedlyraised standards for student behavior.  Differences like this, observers say,lie behind much of the fear parents have about de-tracking--they're not justlooking for high-level academics for their kids, but for a level of commitmentto learning, a brief escape from the anti-intellectualism of American schoolsand society.<p>   "Mixed grouping creates a different playing field," says Philadelphia's HollyPerry. "Youngsters who once behaved as if they didn't have anything tocontribute are now feeling a greater permission to participate. And I see lessisolation of nerds--we're encouraging ways to demonstrate mastery in ways thateveryone recognizes are cool."  The difference in student achievement isevident, she says; a visiting regional superintendent could not pick out, from amixed-ability eighth grade earth science display, the projects that were thework of special education students. Other teachers agree that the climateimproves with mixed groups; in her Global Issues course at Boston English, SusanFleming says, "we have almost no one who is not performing, or who comes everyday but is not with us." Still, she says, because all the school's classes arenot heterogeneous, "the kids know who they are--and when they go into theirtracked classes they know what level they're expected to perform at."<p>   Assessment practices in a heterogeneously grouped school, ideally, also honorthe kind of reflective, non-reductionist thinking that mixed ability groupsfoster.  The Academy for the Middle Years has moved to narrative report cards--ittakes teachers 25 hours to write them out while other staff members fill in attheir posts, Perry says, but "it makes us value what we say we value."<p>   Still, that shift in standards can also create discomfort for students unusedto the new techniques of heterogeneous classes. "We have bright students who gohome and say, 'I'm bored,'" says Salem High School principal Robert Cresswell."They share their parents' and grandparents' mindset--that learning consists of alot of memorizing, right-answer tests, worksheet homework."  The highest-achieving students also resist losing their accustomed, often automatic,privilege and prestige; tracking protects their place in a system that's workedjust fine for them so far.<p><hr><h2>What It Takes to Work</h2><hr>A sustained effort to educate parents seems critical to a school's success witha heterogeneous grouping policy. "We sit worried parents down with our teachingteams and talk about how emphasizing concepts, communication, and collaborationprepares their kids better than the old regurgitation of facts," Cresswell says."And we've started mailing home a monthly newsletter describing just what isgoing on in their kids' classes, and what they should expect their child to belearning and studying."  At McCaskey High School, opposition from parents ofhigher-level students sparked a series of community meetings and district-sponsored discussion programs, says principal John Syphard. Representatives fromBrown and other universities participated, written information was sent out toparents, and many parents came to observe classes in the Essential Studiesprogram. "Part of the problem," Syphard observes, "was that people wronglyassume our Essential Studies program is just the same as the cooperativelearning movement, which a lot of people have trouble with for whatever reasons.Once they see more of what we really do, they feel more comfortable with it."<p>   Equally important if hetero-geneous grouping is to succeed, advocates agree,are vigorous efforts to develop challenging mixed-ability curricula and to giveteachers the time and opportunity for professional development in the new ways."We have two hours a day to work with other teachers," says McCaskey teacher JoStokes. "We also have a district professional education center where we can goand debrief, and a lot of backing from our department chairpeople.  Any time weintroduce a new teaching strategy, we use a lot of peer coaching." Otherobservers suggest lowering class sizes for a time at the start of mixed groupingand suspending conventional teacher evaluations until faculty members becomemore comfortable with the new methods.<p>   "It's a training issue," agrees Boston English's Susan Fleming. "Most of ourteachers don't feel willing to do heterogeneous grouping schoolwide; they'll doit in history and science but not in math and English. People think there's somelinear sequence that drives what the high-achieving kid needs when he goes tocollege, that if you don't teach in this sequence you take away his ability tomake it. To get teachers to identify what's <i>fundamental</i> for students, and tointegrate those things into our curriculum at every level, would take atremendous amount of training and commitment."<p>   Involving outsiders in the school's efforts--from universities to businesspartnerships and parent volunteers--seems to energize programs where students areexpected to meet universal goals. And substantial encouragement is needed fromthe admissions offices of colleges and universities, whose shadow looms largeover the decisions made by most high schools. "We're under terrific pressure toclassify and catalog students so they'll know what they're getting," said oneprincipal. "They know from looking at our transcript that any course number with9 in it is in an advanced placement track. Otherwise what does a 3.9 grade pointaverage mean?"<p>   As new research in cognitive science, such as that of Harvard's HowardGardner and Dennie Wolf, redefines "intelligence" to embrace a much broaderrange of attributes, a profound shift in our attitudes about schooling mustinevitably follow. Schools that change to reflect this shift, as these Essentialschools are trying to do, will not be places where the lowest common denominatorof scholarly challenge prevails, as critics of heterogeneous grouping fear.Instead, they could embrace far more rigorous demands, at the same time allowingmore variation in how those demands are met.<p>    "If we really have faith that all students have intellectual power," JoeMcDonald observes, "a tremendous array of different routes opens up to let themexercise it.  Whether a kid does an internship in a local business or takes anadvanced calculus class in an 'early college' setting, neither one will carry astigma.  We can balance seminar-style and project-based work with sequential,stepwise material where it is appropriate to the subject matter. If you expectthat all students will meet high intellectual standards, there's room for atremendous amount of responsible differentiation in the American high school."<p><hr>                  <h2>     Horace's E-mail</h2><hr>I teach 9 and 10 year olds in Narragansett, Rhode Island. Been there 17 years,all at the fourth grade. As a member of the Citibank Faculty, I've beenlistening to a lot of conversation concerning heterogeneous grouping. It'sinteresting that most high school people think that the "problem" doesn't existat the elementary level. While it may not be as overt, it is there, and the factthat it is underground makes it more of a problem than most people realize.<p>   Many grammar schools still group by ability levels. If there are threeclasses at a given grade level, one will consist of the "high" students, onewill be average, and one low. The typical "reform" has been to put one group ofeach level in each classroom. Unfortunately, what happens is that the teacherskeep the students within the group for most of their work, especially in readingand math. So for perhaps two-thirds of the day, the students are homogeneouslygrouped, with little movement within the groups. An answer to this problem iscalled "whole class / small group" instruction. The students may all read thesame books, but are constantly re-mixed for skill instruction. Our team runs avariation of this where we shuffle all 75 students for skill time. Lots of work,but seems successful on several levels.<p>                Simon Hole<br>                Narragansett, RI<p>Coral Springs Middle School (grades 6, 7, 8) eliminated advanced-average-basicgroupings three years ago. Achievement tests have continued to rise, whiledemographics show a downward trend. A great deal of parent and communitypreparation preceded elimination of tracking. Teacher delivery systems andstrategies are an important component of change.<p>                Pat Ciabotti<br>                Broward County, FL<p><hr>                             <h2> Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or comingeditions.

<html><head><title>CES: Publications: Horace: 9-5: Essential Collaborators</title></head><body><hr><h1><center>Essential Collaborators: Parents, School, and Community</center></h1><hr>                                   <center>Volume 9, Number 5  <br>May 1993</center><hr> The Conyers, Georgia Board of education was in a state of siege. The district's  new Salem High School had opened in a cloud of glory, its commitment to  Essential School ideas endorsed with all the enthusiasm befitting a brand-new  venture with high hopes and expectations. But barely a few months later, a small  and vociferous parent group was turning up the political heat -- demanding a  return to the good old days of tracked courses for "gifted" students, and  calling for the board to cancel all connections with the Coalition of Essential  Schools. "Things got pretty hot," drawls Salem's Assistant Principal Toni  Eubank. "These parents were convinced we were trying to turn their kids into  little Northerners and Communists."<p>     Alarmed, the high school faculty met to consider what to do. In the  excitement of innovation, had they forgotten to keep including the school board  and community in the school's conversations about new ways? How challenging <i>were</i>  their courses, when rhetoric turned into reality? How could they ensure success  for every child and also maintain the high standards everybody wanted? As they  struggled with these issues in the soul-searching months that followed, Salem  High School's staff backtracked, sometimes painfully, to repair community  relations that had gone sour with neglect. A year later, this Essential school's  philosophy has solid board and parental support, and the faculty is united,  Eubanks says, as it has never been before.<p>     Involving the community in the process of change may be the single most  important element in Essential School success. Certainly it is the most commonly  overlooked, in an era when conventional hands-off attitudes toward education are  giving way to consumer advocacy and school choice. Schools that have long  defended against "outsiders" trespassing on educational turf now face a climate  of accountability that can turn hostile in the flash of a political eye. Where  once a school's purview was bounded by geography, no longer can its constituency  -- or even its role in that community -- be so easily defined. Finally, this  country's growing diversity raises the additional challenge of bringing poor and  minority children from broadly diverse family situations into the educational  mainstream.<p>     Research into the effects of parental involvement shows clearly its benefits  for students at every level. Long-term studies published by the National  Committee for Citizens in Education (based in Columbia, Maryland) indicate that  schools with all different types of parent programs have realized immediate and  positive results, including higher achievement levels, decreased operating  costs, increased attendance, and reduced levels of at-risk behavior. At the  secondary level, parents prove harder to draw in -- partly because they lack the  time and confidence to do so, researchers speculate, and partly because high  schools (and their adolescent students!) are not inclined to welcome them. Yet  without their solid support along with that of the larger community, any  thoroughgoing changes in curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment have a poor chance  of taking hold.<p>     Where schools have met this challenge head on -- bringing parents, students,  citizens groups, and educators together to share ideas in new ways and old --  experience shows that change goes farther, faster, and deeper: Consider these  examples from three widely different Essential schools:<p><ul>     <li> Five "focus groups" of townspeople met this spring with trained market- research professionals in the middle-class Hudson Valley school district of  Croton-Harmon, New York. The focus group research method, in which small groups  answer carefully worded questions designed to pinpoint public opinion, is widely  used in business and politics to target and refine new products from laundry  detergent to deficit reduction plans. But soap wasn't the subject here; these  consumer-citizens were grappling with what they wanted their school's graduates  to know and be able to do, and just how they might judge that. <li> On a wintry weekday morning students from all over New York City streamed  into University Heights High School, an alternative school occupying a big  concrete building at Bronx Community College. But a dozen or so parents showed  up as well, to trade insights about themselves and their kids over bacon and  eggs in an advisory group breakfast. A mixed group of University Heights  parents, students, mentors, and teachers routinely hash out issues like course  offerings or service apprenticeships around a conference table on schoolday  afternoons. "I don't like my momma running into me in the halls this way," one  girl wisecracked at one of these meetings, and everybody laughed.     <li>In a city with enough magnet schools that almost any student could go  elsewhere by choice, Baltimore's Walbrook High School has put down sturdy roots  by making school traditions part of the neighborhood way of life. At the end of  every summer Walbrook throws a picnic to send off its new graduates, and every  Christmas recent graduates gather at school for a "Roundtree" where they share  the experiences of their first post-secondary fall. When students seek out  remedial help through a regular SOS (School on Saturdays) program, younger  siblings are invited along -- to throw a ball around, swim in the pool, work in  the computer center, and start a connection with Walbrook that may continue  through a lifetime. </ul><p>    Schools like these are fast abandoning the tradition that parents and  community members are a factor to "deal with" in special situations, and  starting to treat them instead as essential collaborators in the move toward  change. Those who once believed teachers needed more time to understand and buy  into Essential School ideas before they broached them publicly now say they  regret the wait. Trouble brews, veterans observe, when schools spring surprises  on their communities; when all major stakeholders grow used to working together,  in contrast, even dissenters feel their voices are heard. As one superintendent  put it, "We need to bring the community into the loop -- <i>yesterday."</i><p> <hr><h2>Pay Now or Pay Later</h2><hr>  Too often, school change veterans observe, the community becomes drawn into  Essential school change only when organized opposition arises. Typically, the  challenge comes from any of several directions:<p> <ul>    <li>Parents of students who have succeeded by conventional measures, who often  oppose heterogeneous grouping and alternative assessment for fear standards will  grow lax.    <li>Community members who perceive, in the Coalition's focus on depth over  breadth of coverage, threats to special interests like athletics or the arts.    <li>Parents of special education students, who fear performance outcome  standards may label their children as failures.    <li>Tax-limitation citizens groups, protesting expenditures on education. <li>The religious right, objecting to an inquiry-based curriculum. </ul><p>    Whether or not those fears have any basis, Essential School proponents can  virtually count on these interest groups to raise critical voices, school people  say. Some of them -- the religious right is an example - may present such  unyielding opposition to progressive educational ideas that outright struggle  for political control is inevitable. In other cases, though, what schools do to  draw dissenters into a two-way conversation about change may mean the difference  between progress and deep frustration on both sides.<p>     "The choice is between developing a communications strategy up front or going  back to retrofit one later," says Marjorie Ledell, a school board member in  Littleton, Colorado who has worked on community involvement issues with the  joint Re:Learning initiative of the Coalition of Essential Schools and the  Education Commission of the States. "You pay now or you pay later. And everybody  knows it's more expensive to retrofit something than to design it right from the  start."<p>     Ledell, who frequently consults with school districts embroiled in  controversy over school change, argues that opponents of Essential School ideas  are often better organized, use simpler language, and appeal more directly to  people's concerns for their children than do most reformers.<p>     "Schools feel handicapped in the face of all this," she says. "But all of us  have access to the democratic process -- and educators have communications skills  they sometimes forget to use. We just need to stop using jargon. We need to  start making clear and specific links between school reform and the thing all  parents want -- that their children demonstrate success at meaningful  challenges."<p>     The first step in that process, experience shows, is to recognize just how  legitimate parents' concerns really are, and in fact how schools themselves have  shaped them through past practice. "In the past we've given parents a standard  of excellence that relies on ability grouping and college admissions," says CES  Director for Schools Bob McCarthy. "We shouldn't pull that out from under them  without honoring the perceptions of parents." That central question of standards  galvanizes parents, McCarthy says, giving schools a unique opportunity to invite  them into an intellectual discourse that welcomes dissenting views as a sign of  real interest.<p>     "They have a rightful concern that their kids not suffer in comparison with  others," McCarthy says. "Nobody wants their kids to be guinea pigs." A key  solution, he argues, is to enlist college and university personnel in the change  effort, making them familiar with Essential School principles and asking them to  take special interest in students whose records may reflect changes ranging from  integrated curriculum to exhibitions. CES has already formally begun this  process; under the leadership of Sharon Lloyd Clark, its Admissions Project  (modeled after a similar effort in the 1930s, the Progressive Education  Association's Eight Year Study) has won support from several dozen selective  colleges, starting with Amherst, Brown, and Columbia and progressing through a  highly competitive lexicon. The National Association of College Admission  Counselors has endorsed the Coalition's efforts and urged its members to  familiarize colleges with changes in their schools. And regional Coalition  conferences now make it a point to include admissions staff from public and  private colleges in the area.<p> <hr> <h2>Communities Set Standards</h2><hr>  At least as important as marshalling that support, however, is the action  schools take to get communities to articulate their own standards for  excellence. This issue has leaped to the forefront of the national agenda for  school improvement, as state after state mandates new "performance outcome"  standards and assessment methods by which to measure them. Up for grabs is  whether such standards are to be general guidelines, with schools and districts  having authority to meet and assess them by whatever methods they see fit, or  whether some national curriculum and central testing instrument will come into  standardized use. Arguing strongly for local control is CES chairman Theodore  Sizer -- and in his view, each community must play a unique and individual role  in deciding what its high school graduates should know and be able to do.<p>     Just that impulse moved New York's Croton-Harmon school district this spring,  when the school board and Superintendent Sherry King decided to turn to  sophisticated marketing techniques to explore the question of graduation  standards in community focus groups. Their timing could not have been more apt.  New York's Commissioner of Education, Tom Sobol, had just proposed to make  schools accountable for meeting state curriculum guidelines in their own ways,  giving each locality substantial latitude while monitoring them via a British- style system of auditing and inspection.<p>     In her previous job as principal of Croton-Harmon's high school, King had  already worked to draw parents into the Essential School effort there -- notably,  by regularly holding evening workshops where parents explored the same ideas  teachers were studying in professional development. Her charge as superintendent  was to expand this outreach to the larger community; but just how to do this,  she admits, was not immediately clear.<p>     "I started by meeting with the school board for an all-day work session on  what its role would be in a restructured system," she says. As schools move to  shared decision-making and management, King observes, school boards face the  same uncomfortable confusions other stakeholders do: "They don't want to  presume, but they don't want to be left out, either." Next the board called a  major community meeting, specifically inviting a wide range of citizens groups  and other business and civic leaders as well as parents "to talk about new goals  for our schools," King says, and to hear speakers from the state and the  Coalition. At that meeting, the board announced its plan for focus groups to  continue the conversation about local goals and standards. Its chief questions  for the community: "What do you want our high school graduates to know and be  able to do? And what will you accept as evidence of their achievement?"<p>     "We found someone in town who was trained in conducting focus groups," King  says. "We had a series of prompts to follow up the questions with. I went to  each session, but only as a note-taker; in the last ten minutes, they could ask  me questions if they liked. And it was extraordinary -- so many of the community  concerns dovetailed precisely with the ideas we were already exploring." <p>     The community loved the focus groups, King says: "They keep asking for more!"  And as the results are analyzed, they spark an important sequence of checks and  balances in which the community plays a very explicit role. "In the future,"  King ventures, "our board will be in a position to serve as panel of judges for  performance tasks developed at the school. They can support our parent-faculty  decision-making council by keeping a check on students' progress. They will have  a basis for agreeing how to judge work thoughtfully. And they can demonstrate  our belief that we are ALL accountable for these agreed-upon assessments. We  have got to be able to go back to our community and say, 'We have seen these  assessments and they DO demonstrate what we say we want for kids.'"<p> <hr> <h2>Issues that Raise Hackles</h2><hr>  The Croton-Harmon community was no model of harmonious views when this whole  process began, says school board president Mary Jo Dean, who served on the  seven-member committee both before and after Essential School ideas took hold.  "People didn't feel that everything was fine," she says. "They read the <i>New York Times</i> and they were cognizant of the declining state of education in this  country. They wanted higher standards set for our kids."<p>     Parents in this largely upper-middle-class community were also driven, the  board realized, by the desire to see their children accepted by competitive  colleges. "We are trying to educate parents about how the SATs and other  standardized tests have crippled the curriculum and pushed the level of learning  to its lowest," Dean says. "I'm a science education consultant, and I've seen  what it's done to the science curriculum." Her school board devotes every other  meeting exclusively to educational issues; at those meetings members have shown  parents typical questions on standardized tests, and described how they would  like to replace those questions. "The typical multiple-choice question might  ask, 'What is the basic particle of matter?' and you choose from the atom, the  molecule, the element, and the ion," says Dean. "Do you want your kids to answer  that? Or do you want them to be able to explain the particulate nature of  matter?"<p>     To help do that, Croton-Harmon musters all available resources -- bringing in  Coalition consultants, plying key opinion-makers with literature on educational  issues, taking parents and board members along to conferences. "What causes  problems is fear and lack of control," Dean argues. "You have to start with the  broadest arena: What do we want for all children? We got teachers and students  at the high school saying what they want to know and do when they get out; then  we got parents to come and do the same thing. When you see unanimity on those  flip charts, that's where you start -- and where there are potential conflicts  you bring everyone back in to work sessions, take a look at what we can observe  and what experts say, and ask where do we go from here?"<p> <hr> <h2>Build Structures Early</h2><hr>  A good relationship with the community takes time to build up, but it proves its  worth when a school hits the inevitable rough spots over volatile change issues.  "Croton-Harmon had a history of parental involvement," observes Bob McCarthy.  "If you don't have a built-up set of structures in place, it's difficult to deal  with trouble when it arises."<p>     New schools face this problem in spades, and so their efforts make  particularly good examples of the risks and benefits community involvement  entails. In Amherst, New Hampshire, principal Bob Mackin and his hand-picked  staff spent a full year planning before they opened the doors of Souhegan High  School. At several community meetings and through four district-wide mailings,  they introduced and explored Essential School ideas. But certain cherished  principles which they held to be unshakeable - mixed achievement-level grouping,  for example, and Souhegan's integrated curriculum - came under almost immediate  fire from parents who had been unhappy with similar ideas as they had played out  at the local middle school. "In hindsight, we should have done even more early  on," Mackin says now.<p>     By the time school opened last fall, Souhegan's philosophy faced a full-scale  political challenge, eventually including a school board contest and a citizens  petition that specifically asked the town to replace the new ideas with a more  traditional approach. Debate raged in the local newspaper and - at candidates  coffees. A month before the spring Town Meeting where school affairs come up for  district-wide vote, Souhegan sponsored two forums where educational and business  experts testified in favor of the Essential School and teachers and students  described their experiences. On the Town Meeting floor the school's opponents  traded arguments and evidence with Superintendent Rick Lalley (New Hampshire's  Superintendent of the Year); of the six students who rose to offer opinions,  only one criticized his courses as being less than challenging. The vote cast by  written ballot because of its incendiary potential came in for Souhegan, 284 to  48.<p>     "I tell people they can depend on democracy, even though in the short term it  may look like you're getting beat up," says Marjorie Ledell, who helped write  ECS's new book <i>How to Deal with Criticism to School Change </i>(available through  ASCD, 1250 N. Pitt St., Alexandria, VA 22314-1403). "It'll carry you through."  Still, the crux of winning these political struggles is not mere public  relations, Bob Mackin observes, but real substance. "Challenging our brightest  students is our toughest and most talked-about issue here," he says. "We're not  sweeping it under the rug." Good public relations only buys time, he says, "to  confront the more difficult and different experiences. Meanwhile, we invite  parents in frequently to witness exhibitions and student work. And we  continually work with teachers on new skills and strategies, so all students  will be challenged to their maximum ability."<p>     From inside the school building, where teachers struggle to accommodate new  and difficult educational ways, the temptation is great to delay potentially  disruptive community involvement until the faculty is unified in its beliefs.  But experience shows that the earlier schools turn outsiders into insiders, the  better. In the comfortable Portland suburb of Cape Elizabeth, Maine, for  example, the high school staff had been exploring Essential School ideas for  three years in a bid to raise standards for all students. In the flush of  developing new proposals for longer-block schedules and other changes, they paid  too little attention to parents already frustrated by other district reforms  they saw as going poorly. Even with a 35-7 positive faculty vote and substantial  school board support, when push came to shove the board voted to table Coalition  membership until community consensus could be reached.<p>     "When you're up to your neck in alligators," high school principal Frank  Miles comments wryly, "it's hard to think about anything but alligators." In  retrospect, he says, his faculty realizes they should have involved middle  school parents in discussions about high school change. "By the time we were  ready to act, their kids would be coming into high school and the parents would  be on our wave length."<p>     "You need to try initially to get a good solid conversation going among the  teachers," says Marjorie Ledell. "If they are feuding among themselves, a bad  perception develops in the community. But you can't slow down the rest of  process. Things leak out anyway, and you might as well acknowledge what you're  going through. Even if you don't have consensus, if people feel like you're open  you've made a lot of headway."<p>     Finally, Frank Miles warns, "Don't get too far out in front of your  community. If you want to move to a longer schedule in the high school, start  talking with parents about that. If you want to focus on curriculum essentials,  go after that kind of question. If teachers are going to focus on habits of mind  instead of mere content coverage, parents have got to be willing to accept the  achievement test results." Schools should use whatever means they can devise - a  steering committee, potluck suppers, action groups -- to build a constituency,  Miles urges. Even if only a small percentage of the community shows up, a  supportive network of information begins that will spread as people talk  informally at athletic events and elsewhere.<p>     "That kind of web makes change not a foreign notion," Miles says. "We need to  convey that the Coalition is not a franchise - it means evolving our own program  consistent with Essential School principles. It took such an effort to get  ourselves ready to change the world inside the school that we didn't focus on  managing change in the rest of our community."<p> <hr><h2>What Is a Community?</h2><hr>  Magnet schools or other schools drawing from a widely dispersed community must  often work especially hard to draw parents in. New York City's Central Park East  Secondary School mails a weekly newsletter to every parent and anyone else who  has an interest in the school; it not only reminds them of key dates and  announcements but describes Essential School ideas in a regular column by co- principals Deborah Meier and Paul Schwartz, publishes student opinion and  commentary, and urges parents to vote for supportive candidates in school board  elections. "It's interesting that a lot of the most effective schools in terms  of involving the community are the ones led by people with grass-roots community  organizing experience," observes ethnographer Donna Muncey, who with Patrick  McQuillan is completing a book based on a five-year study of eight Essential  schools.<p>     Students and their parents have chosen Central Park East through the city's  school choice system, and a condition of enrollment is that parents and students  together attend regular teacher conferences. An intimate advisory system keeps  close track of student progress and attendance, always watchful for unusual home  situations that might affect them. And though the school has no strictly  geographical community, it creates a sense of community with a range of outside  entities: local colleges where some students take classes; Columbia University's  NCREST project on assessment; community service organizations where students  volunteer; and other nearby Coalition member schools.<p>     Expanding conventional notions of a school's community also entails drawing  in those who traditionally have been ignored or excluded by the mainstream. The  Coalition's ATLAS Communities partnership with Yale University's School  Development Program, Harvard University's Project Zero, and the Education  Development Corporation draws inspiration from Yale professor James Comer's work  with elementary school communities to bring poor and minority parents into the  educational mainstream. Comer has sought to bridge the social and cultural gulf  between home and school, which he believes deeply affects students' psycho- social development and in turn their academic achievement.<p>     A student may encounter trouble at school, Comer argues, if he has no  experience with negotiating and compromise; yet at home he may be punished if he  doesn't fight back. Parents then take their children's failure as evidence of  the mainstream's animosity; defensive or hostile, they avoid contact with school  staff, and the distrust becomes mutual. Comer's School Development Program  enlists these parents onto school governance and management teams, where they  work with school people and mental health professionals to shape academic  policies, social programs, and school procedures. Parent aides work for minimum  wage in the classroom, to help staff integrate social skills with academics and  the arts, teaching children everything from how to write checks to how to plan  concerts. Comer urges communities and schools to regard students' social  development and academic ability as equally important; the school's role, he  argues, is not only to produce high test scores but to prepare students to  assume adult responsibilities.<p> <hr><h2>Small Schools, No Surprises</h2><hr>  The more schools work to know their communities in non-adversarial ways, it  seems, the more trusting people will be. But few enough parents serve on shared  management teams that schools need plenty of other strategies to get the  community on board. "It's hard to create relationships with the parents of 2,000  kids," comments CES's Rick Lear, who works on the ATLAS project. "Back-to-school  nights don't do it." The best results, he says, have come from advisory systems  or very small "houses," where parental contact is facilitated by the fact that a  student may work with the same teachers for several years.<p>     Some schools, like Thayer High School in Winchester, New Hampshire, also  bring parents monthly into the classroom to actually try the work their children  are doing. Others have sponsored "family math nights," where parents and  students together work on problems using new approaches. "It's labor intensive,"  concedes Lear. "But parents start to understand some of the complexity of what  the school is trying to get their kids to learn. There may be no other way."<p>     "Administrators should spend as little time as possible <i>explaining</i> Essential  School ideas," agrees Bob McCarthy, "and as much time as possible having parents  <i>experience</i> what it's like to be in an Essential school classroom." For another  key to community involvement, Bob McCarthy suggests, Essential schools should  look to where parents have historically gathered in support -- to drama, band,  sports, and other school performances. "People like to see their kids perform,"  he observes. "Now we have to make academic exhibitions into performances worth  coming to look at."<p>     That ties in directly, McCarthy says, to the volatile issues of academic  challenge that so often turn parents into opponents of Essential School reforms.  "They can come see first-class, serious student work being honored," he says.  "But the school's clear policy should be to honor that work <i>after</i> it is  demonstrated, not <i>before</i>, which is what dividing kids into honors classes does.  It's no different from a college designating someone <i>cum laude."</i><p>     Students who do meaningful work as apprentices with mentors in the community  also win allies for Essential School ideas. And bringing in non-parents with  special skills as juries for student exhibitions spreads community awareness and  raises academic standards to reflect the real world's demands.<p>     At the same time, experienced principals have learned, they can build key  supporters in the community by regularly inviting perhaps half a dozen opinion- makers -- clergy, or service organization leaders, or business people -- to  informally discuss their views about what students should learn, and how. (The  media likes that opportunity too, usually through individual interviews.) "Quite  often these people have never been asked about their perceptions," says Marjorie  Ledell.<p>     "The point is not that everybody is going to agree with you," Rick Lear says.  "It's that you have an established relationship with enough people so that when  you talk about new ideas they don't come as a surprise." Introducing change to  people just as the decision has been made or is about to be made, he argues,  overwhelms them with confusion and misinformation. "In lots of change efforts  people have to accept or support things they aren't sure about," he says. "But  they don't like surprise."<p>     "So much of the whole situation was about trust," says Toni Eubank of Salem  High School, where last year's parental uprising has quieted into a steady  dialogue about standards and teaching practices. "We have just as many difficult  issues facing us now as we ever did -- from our opposition to AP courses on down.  The difference now is that we're talking about them together with the community.  That one thing has got them on our side." <p> <hr>               <h2>Some Suggestions for Bringing the Community to School</h2><hr> <ul><li>Sponsor evening study groups where parents can explore the same educational  issues teachers and administrators are learning about -- integrated curriculum,  advisories, heterogeneous grouping, exhibitions.<p> <li>Have public exhibitions of student work, formally presenting the best projects  before the community. Make sure student work actually addresses important  questions in rigorous ways; weak presentations trivialize Essential School  ideas. Invite community members to serve as a panel of judges, especially when  their expertise makes that particularly relevant.<p> <li>Redistribute money to pay parents modest hourly fees to help as classroom  aides. They can work individually with students to keep them up to speed where  necessary in difficult readings or projects.<p>  <li>Take parents, students, and school board members along to symposia and  conferences on important change topics. Supply good readings on school reform to  everyone who shows interest in running for the school board.<p> <li>Don't explain -- experience! Get parents and community members into the  classroom to actually try out the same kinds of assignments their kids are being  asked to do. Some schools have "family math nights"; others get adults exploring  essential questions in collaborative groups.<p> <li>Some "choice" schools require parents to attend teacher-parent conferences if  the student is to remain enrolled. Many also insist students be present at  conferences, as the key players in their own education.<p> <li>Advisory groups spur parental involvement, because concerned parents can  contact one person who knows their child well, not several who don't. Many  schools have regular "advisory breakfasts" where parents come in for coffee and  conversation about (and with) their kids.<p> <li>Invite small groups of half a dozen people influential in the community to  meet with the principal to share their perceptions of student learning. Church  leaders, higher (or lower) education people, business people, and civic leaders  appreciate the attention to their concerns.<p> </ul><hr>          <h2>   Some Suggestions for Bringing School into the Community</h2><hr> <ul> <li>Apprenticeships, internships, and "service learning" programs involve   community members by their very nature. Get key people together and brainstorm   for ideas and opportunities.<p> <li>Use your city as a classroom. Build academic partnerships or sponsor student   projects along with universities, agencies, and nonprofit groups.<p>  <li>Sponsor open community forums where prominent educators, business leaders, and   management experts talk about what they need schools to be teaching and why.   Send written invitations to non-parent groups like the chamber of commerce,   the Rotary Club, senior citizens' groups, preschools, etc. Televise meetings   on local cable, so those who can't attend can watch. Leave plenty of time for   questions.<p> <li>Publish a newsletter as often as possible -- weekly is best -- addressing real   educational questions as well as upcoming events. It can be a forum for   student ideas and parent input, too. Send it to anyone with any expressed   interest in the schools, parent or not.<p> <li>Meet regularly with town or city officials to explore ways school and   municipality can work together to better meet the needs of students. Be ready   to help with facilities and share maintenance for public projects like   recreation and the arts. Or look for ways to offer joint outreach services to   young children, seniors, and students.<p> <li>Once students have substantial experience with Essential School challenges   (like exhibitions and heterogeneous classes), get them to speak at community   forums about the changes. But don't do this too early -- substance convinces   not mere theory.<p> <li>Ask the local newspaper to publish a regular column about educational issues.   Get someone who writes well to introduce Essential School ideas there, one by   one. Use plenty of examples.<p> </ul><hr>                  <h2>   Attitudes that Foster Involvement</h2><hr> <ul><li>Start talking with middle school parents about shaping high school goals, so   everybody has time to think through and become comfortable with Essential   School ideas. The class entering 6th grade in 1993-94 will graduate from high   school in 2000 -- a realistic target year. <li>Use plain language, not fuzzy or misleading slogans, to describe the changes   you have in mind. Your opponents can gain more ground with "no new taxes" than   you can with "authentic assessment." Instead talk in concrete terms -- about   coaching all students to communicate, to work with others, to fulfill their   potential, to demonstrate what they know. <li>Use teacher conferences as conversations with parents, not one-way reports.   First finding out what's on their minds establishes an emotional connection,    which makes the intellectual connection come more easily. <li> Don't feel you need a united front among teachers before broaching ideas for   change to the community. You may make more headway if you are open about your   vulnerabilities and about the difficulties of change. <li>Make plans for involving the community even in the earliest planning stages.   New schools do this as a matter of course, and so should established schools   considering change.  <li>Don't denigrate or dismiss parents' legitimate concerns about the relationship   between high school work and college admissions. Schools made that connection   in the first place, after all. <li>Listen to students' voices -- they are your emissaries in the home and   community. Ask students for feedback into the process of change. <li>Start any shared governance move by training all involved together in setting   agendas, consensus building, and decision-making. Don't forget to supply   continued training as new people come in. <li>Keep in touch with graduates and follow up on their post-secondary studies.   Visit their colleges, meet their advisers, look at their work, observe the   level of their involvement with their education. Keep records -- this is good   documentation. </ul><p><hr>          <h2>Community Focus Groups Ask: "What Do We Expect From Graduates?"</h2><hr>  Focus groups of citizens in the Croton-Harmon, New York School District met with  trained market-research professionals to answer these questions, each of which  was explored further using the prompts that follow:<p>  1. What would you expect a graduate of our public schools to know and be able to  do?<p> 2. What evidence would you accept that he or she has achieved those goals?<p>  <h3>PROMPTS FOR EXPLORING #1 (GRADUATION EXPECTATIONS)</h3> <ol> <li> The overall education requirements in terms of years of English, history,    mathematics, science, etc. have not changed in any significant way since most    of us went to school.  Our students will enter a work place that demands    technology and where most of them will have approximately seven jobs in their    lifetime. Do you think that the current requirements adequately help prepare    students for that work place?<p> <li>For the past five years the Labor Department and business roundtables around    the country have listed interpersonal skills and the ability to work in a    group as essential to success in the work place. Du you think that the    schools should work on these areas of the curriculum?<p> <li>In times of economic difficulty society tends to focus on basics. What is    your feeling about the place of music and the arts in preparing our students    to take their place in society?<p> <li>Are there any particular skills (for example, the ability to write clearly),    habits of mind (for example, perseverance over time), or content (for    example, the facts about the Civil War) that you believe all graduates of our    school should know or be able to demonstrate?<p> </ol><h3> PROMPTS FOR EXPLORING #2 (Acceptable Evidence)</h3> <ol> <li> Doctoral students have to not only present their research but defend it    orally before a committee. Do you think the high school students should have    to publicly present and defend their larger works, and would you accept such    a defense as a demonstration of mastery?<p>  <li>If students engage in school-sponsored internships or projects with child    care agencies, industry, or environmental organization, would you accept the    report of the student's supervisor as part of his or her academic record?<p>  <li>Many of us have the experience of barely passing a certain course in order to    get a required credit for graduation. Some schools now give a grade of A, B,    C, or incomplete, requiring the students to take the time necessary to do    better than just pass. What do you think of this idea for our schools?<p>                          <hr>                             <h2>  Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or coming editions.

<html><head><TITLE>CES: Publications: Horace: 6-2: Educational Policy and the Essential School</TITLE> </head><body><hr><center><H1> Educational Policy and the Essential School</H1></center>                <hr>                                <center>Volume 6, Number 2<BR> January 1990</center><hr>                      Two teachers are working on integrating the government and earth scienceinstruction at their high school, linking environmental concerns to theirpolitical ramifications.  The principal has scheduled their classes back toback, and they are planning to meet the two groups together.  But stateregulations forbid the earth science teacher from doing so, because she is notcertified to teach social studies.  What should they do?<p>   An English teacher is planning his ninth-grade course around essentialquestions having to do with the portrayal of heroes in literature.  But thestate requires all students to pass a standardized competency test in English,and the test is heavy on grammar and vocabulary.  In addition, the districtrequires that he use the textbook they have chosen, which fits poorly with hisapproach. How can he proceed?<p>   When a school commits itself to teaching students to use their minds well, itdoes not happen in a vacuum.  From every quarter, objections will be raised.Perhaps the state requires that a certain number of minutes be devoted to asubject each year, or the district controls classroom procedures by making sureteachers are evaluated using a strict set of criteria.  The school board wantsto see standardized test scores go up every year, and holds the principalaccountable for it.  The teachers' union won't let its members teach outsidetheir disciplines, or use after-school time for joint planning sessions.  Theuniversity's teacher-training program discourages interdisciplinary approachesby its credit requirements.  If one listens to everyone, it seems hardlypossible that anyone could succeed in turning students into workers, teachersinto generalists, and schools into the kinds of learning places that theCoalition of Essential Schools supports.<p>   And yet some do succeed.  Weaving their way through the maze of existingpolicies, Essential schools are managing steadily to make changes within theexisting educational establishment.  How they do it--and especially how they dealwith policies that would seem to block change--is a fascinating study in humanand group dynamics, and a revealing lesson in pragmatic politics.<p>   Dennis Littky, the principal of Thayer High School in Winchester, NewHampshire, tells the story of the district that sent three delegations to visithis small and thriving Essential school.  First came the teachers, who lovedLittky's program but assured him that their principal would never go for it.Next, the principal visited; a great idea, he said, but the school board wouldbalk.  Finally, the school board sent a visitor, and of course he confided thatchange was impossible in his district, given the attitudes of the school people."I called them all up at the end," Littky says. "'I have a little secret foryou,' I said."<p>   In fact, at every level of education, individuals will absolve themselvesfrom any intention of blocking a school's change towards the Coalition's commonprinciples.  It is hard to find, these days, an educator or legislator orpolicy-maker who disavows an interest in critical thinking, for example.  Whatobstacles often seem to boil down to is, instead, the kind of bureaucratic"standard operating procedures" that nobody quite has the nerve (or theperceived authority) to ignore, defy, or change.<p>   To understand just what influence policy can have on attempts to change, itis interesting to look at this from the broadest level first.  When thegovernors met at President Bush's national "education summit" in the fall of1989, their hope was to coalesce the country around a common set of goals.  "Ifyou define 'policy' as setting a direction as well as establishing legalrequirements," notes Beverly Anderson of the Re:Learning project of theEducation Commission of the States (ECS) and the Coalition of Essential Schools,"then anything that comes out of this summit will definitely have a policy<i>effect</i>."  It makes a difference, in other words, in what terms national goalsare couched.  If they focus on outcomes at the expense of process, they couldencourage techniques that prevent rather than foster Essential School goals--anemphasis on rote learning, for example, rather than training students to solveproblems and think critically.<p>   The actions of Congress, too, affect schools considering fundamentalclassroom change.  In 1988, for example, Congress passed the Audit Reform Act,amending federal auditing policies and procedures.  State education agencies maynow ask the U.S. Department of Education in advance whether certain programsthey might operate will satisfy federal educational standards, and if therequest is not denied within 45 days, it's safe to go ahead with no fear of afederal audit. The old system had effectively stifled many new ideas; under thenew rules innovative programs using federal funds are expected to flourish.<p>   One step down at the state level, the country has been swept throughout the1980s by a rage for the legislation of educational excellence.  Virtually everygovernor lists education as a top priority, and state legislatures have tackledsubstantive educational issues with unprecedented speed and fiscal muscle.School reform is now fashionable across the political spectrum.  On a practicallevel, this means that the state pays closer attention than it ever has tomatters like course requirements for high school graduation, teacher andadministrator compensation, and accountability measures like dropout rates andstandardized tests.  And it underlines that attention with money: stategovernments now pay an average of half the cost of public education, accordingto the National Center for Education Statistics.<p>   One critical question, then, is what the state is looking for in the way ofschool change.  If its focus is more on easily measurable outcomes than onquestions of active learning, a school that has been academically thriving byconventional measures may face alarm and resistance if it tries to tinker withits academic processes.<p><hr><h2>States May Not Be a Problem</h2><hr>Interestingly, that kind of resistance may not come from the state at all, butfrom closer to home.  The state, after all, may monitor schools in trouble moreclosely than its high achievers; to schools that do it proud it grants thereward of benign inattention.  Instead, the blocks to change may come from muchmore local sources: parents concerned with test scores and college admissions;teachers unwilling to bend contract clauses; school boards and superintendentscomplacent with the status quo or doing what they believe the state wants themto.<p>   At this level, "policy" starts to be translatable as not a set of officialregulations but an attitude loosely transcribed as "what's happening."  Changingthe way things are is complicated by the difficulty of clearly identifying justwho in the system actually does hold the power to make or block change.  At acertain point, it even stops mattering whether something is technically "policy"or not--the courts will regard as policy anything that has been practice in asystem for some time.<p>   Looked at from this angle, policy becomes a problem only when it is <i>perceived</i>to be a problem.  When everybody acts as if student learning comes before anyother priority, change can slip through any number of policy "obstacles." Insome cases, a determined and creative administrator--be it principal,superintendent, or state board of education member--can actually use theconflicts and inconsistencies within a complicated policy environment to theadvantage of the unorthodox school.  It seems as though how one conceives andacts on one's role can have a lot to do with how much is "allowed."<p>   In the maze of New York City's enormous and complex decentralized schoolsystem, that is exactly how Central Park East Secondary School has managed tosurvive and flourish.  Enmeshed in four different sets of controls--the StateEducation Law, the City Charter, the Chancellor's Regulations, and the cityboard of education--an enterprising new superintendent cultivated a policy of"creative noncompliance."  Slippage within the system allowed  some innovationsto get through; as they started to show results, exemptions were granted forothers. Central Park East established itself as an alternative high school,making possible departures from standard city high school policies.  Andprincipal Deborah Meier grew expert at reading contracts and policies to herschool's advantage, either using loopholes to support her decisions orinterpreting the intent of the policy as favorable to her own actions.<p>   Though methods like this may be risky, they are widely used by some of thepeople who are moving most quickly towards change in large systems that areeasily dragged down by their own sheer size and weight.  They seem to work bestin a school setting where parent choice is part of the system--parents who objectto the school's priorities can go elsewhere, and those who like the changes soonline up to participate.  For similar reasons, private schools run into far lessofficial opposition; their policies can be set by a determined principal who hasa free hand as long as the results please the governing board of trustees.<p><hr><h2>Which Policies Block Change?</h2><hr>Still, people who talk about school change encounter the persistent objectionthat fundamental classroom change is ultimately blocked by state policies andregulations.  Is this an excuse for passing the buck, or is it true?  The answerbecame strikingly evident at the Coalition of Essential Schools' recent FallForum, where CES's Amy Gerstein and ECS's Judy Bray led a workshop on policyconcerns and system change.  Giving out summaries of various states' policiesaffecting learning goals, curriculum, and instruction, the two first askedparticipants to identify the intent of the policies as a whole.  Then, workingwith a clear plan for school change towards Essential School principles,workshop members analyzed where state policies proved to be barriers to change.In almost every case, the barriers were very minor: if the policy's INTENT waskept in mind, schools could comply broadly while still introducing new pedagogyand structures. (See Figure 1)<p>   "What we're finding," says Judy Bray, "is that very few individual statepolicies actually get in the way of the Coalition's nine common principles.However, it seems that their <i>combined</i> effect can be an obstacle.  Perhaps astate's assessment policy is open enough to school change, but when you combinethat with curriculum requirements and textbook policies, it becomes a difficultmaze to get through."<p>   The situation is complicated by the fact that districts, not individualschools, usually apply for exemptions from state policies if they are needed.  Aschool can run into big trouble, says Bray, if its district is not supportive ofits move towards change.  Even within a district that may give lip service toactive learning goals, competing structures of policy--like teacher evaluation,testing, or mandated curricula--may get in their way.  "In a situation like this,a school has to either proceed very quietly in a quiet community, or havefriends in the system, at the district or the state level, to help move throughthe process," Bray says.<p>   For the six states who belong to it, the Re:Learning initiative can functionas that "friend in the system." The endeavor is subtitled "From Schoolhouse toStatehouse" because its goal is to enlist the efforts of policymakers,administrators, and school people at every level in changing the way studentslearn.  In practice, this means that Essential schools in Re:Learning states aregetting the time and the funds to plan their programs carefully, and the supportthey need to sidestep any problematic policies.<p>   Still, "it's seldom policy that's the problem in terms of state laws," saysRe:Learning's Beverly Anderson.  "It's more a matter of persuading people."  Andmany state education people say that the district administrators are the keypeople to persuade.  "I don't know why," says one former district administratornow at the state level, "but the psychology of districts is to blame the statefor blocking change."<p>   In practical terms, influencing change at the district level means mobilizingthe support of teachers, principals, unions, parents, school board, andsuperintendent.  But if one of these key agents is missing, says Delaware'sRe:Learning coordinator, Joe Fitzpatrick, the game is not up.  "The assumptionis that you need approval from above," he says.  "But I like to think ofRe:Learning as a wonderful feminist system," where power is exercised in anetwork of support rather than in a hierarchical power structure.  "I call it'kicking around in the cream to make butter,'" Fitzpatrick says.  Policy changescan be as subtle, for example, as changes in attitude on the part of schoolboard members who have been lobbied informally on educational issues.  Or theycan involve persuading teachers' unions that their work with students will bemore productive and interesting once change is undertaken.<p>   "Remember that unions grew up to match centralized management," says AFTrepresentative William Harty, a restructuring advocate from the union'sWashington offices who attended the CES Fall Forum.  "The key to change is toget both union and management to admit that things aren't going well in ourschools, which is very hard for both groups.  With the Lake Wobegon theory oftesting, student performance measures have become a scam--all the children areabove average.  That's why business groups are confronting the school problems:they have to work with the products."<p>   District policies can seem to exert a stranglehold on efforts to change whenthey dictate such matters as teacher evaluation forms, methods of instruction,or curriculum.  But if teachers and principals support a change in pedagogy,"none of this is absolute," argues ECS policy analyst Rexford Brown.  "In oneclassroom a teacher can say, 'Basic skills tests make XYZ impossible to do,' andin another classroom a teacher is doing it.  Different schools, differentteachers react differently to policy. New, young teachers might follow the rulesmore closely, while more experienced teachers have confidence that theirstudents can do well on skills tests, for instance, even if they don't teach TOthe tests."<p>   The key, then, is not necessarily changing policies but changing the cultureof the school itself, says Brown.  "That culture is a product not only of policybut of professional norms and experience," he says.  "The practitioners--theteachers and principals--have to take responsibility for how they are going toteach, and to interpret the policy in ways that allow that."<p><hr><h2>What Can Be Done?</h2><hr>But that prescription is a tall order.  From the bottom of the school system up,it means a new kind of creativity and action--both to bring change into schoolsdespite policy obstacles, and to shape policies at every level to reflect thepedagogy Essential School people are trying to introduce.  Especially inEssential schools in Re:Learning states, this is going on in a number ofpolitically effective ways.<p>   The first tactic such schools recommend is to involve all groups in athoroughgoing analysis of their schools' needs and priorities. Especiallyimportant are district-level people: teachers unions, school board members,administrators, community groups, students --everyone who will be affected insome way by school change.  At this point, it may be useful to ignore perceivedpolicy obstacles altogether, and to concentrate instead on coming to agreementon what students should know and be able to do, and how they can best learn.<p>   Lobbying at the state level is another effective step.  Each state board ofeducation has just received from the National Association of State Boards ofEducation (1012 Cameron St., Alexandria, VA 22314) the results of that group'scomprehensive study of school restructuring, called "Today's Children,Tomorrow's Survival." In no uncertain terms that report calls for a broadredefinition of the state's role, encouraging Essential School-style activelearning in the classroom and decentralized decisionmaking in districts andschools.  It is a powerful document with which to change attitudes towardsschooling at the top of the power structure.<p>   If the governor and chief state school officer can be persuaded to joinRe:Learning, districts will find the path to change smoothed considerablythrough funding, technical assistance, and increased understanding.  But even ifthat route does not exist, exemptions and waivers are commonly granted by thestate for districts that show a commitment to change.  And creativeadministrators at both school and district level can go through the back door toaccomplish their goals as well.  One key is to interpret a policy's intent asbroadly as possible, and to press ahead strongly enough that results can bedemonstrated.<p>   Keeping records of a school's results--and publicizing them as soon aspossible--has already proved successful in Essential schools'  mobilizingwidespread support for change.  The conventional assessment measures likestandardized tests rarely show a drop and often rise when active learning isintroduced, but Beverly Anderson urges schools to initiate the use ofalternative measures instead, or in addition.  Writing assessment tools andinstruments to measure higher-order thinking do exist; schools that find and usethem can build public confidence in new methods of learning, and educate thecommunity at the same time.  The same technique applies as dropout andattendance rates improve.<p>   Perhaps most important, as a school moves towards change surrounded byconfusing and conflicting policies, is a strong leader who can guide it on itspath.  Though leadership anywhere in the system is helpful, it may be mostcrucial at the district level. That is where imagination and flexibility,"creative noncompliance" and power sharing, can have the most far-reachingeffects on system change.<p>   "We've got a lot of policy on the books already," says Warren Chapman, aconsultant with the Illinois State Board of Education and a Re:Learningcoordinator for the Chicago area.  "We don't need to create more of it.  What wewant is to reconfigure policy so it becomes a reaction to what schools want todo.   The state board has to act different, which means eventually legislatorswill have to act different.  Instead of responding to special interest groups,for the first time in recent history they will have to listen to and work withthe people in the trenches, and create a policy environment that allows schoolsto be creative.  Policy doesn't have to be an action; it can be an attitude."<p><hr>                    <h2>Figure 1: A Checklist for School People<br>        How Can Essential Schools Approach State and District Policies?</h2><hr><b>-COURSE REQUIREMENTS.</b>  Identifying specific courses that high schools must     offer.<p>   <b>APPROACH: </b>An Essential school could incorporate  a required course (such as     U.S. History) into an interdisciplinary offering (such as 11th grade     Humanities).<p><b>-TEXTBOOK SELECTION. </b> Requiring that state- or district-selected textbooks be     used by schools.<p>   <b>APPROACH: </b>An Essential school could approach the text as one of several     resources available as students explore essential questions posed by the     course.<p><b>-TEACHER CERTIFICATION.</b>  Requiring state certification in a specific subject     before a teacher may cover it in class.<p>   <b>APPROACH: </b> Could impede interdisciplinary course development and "teacher as     generalist" approach in Essential schools.  May require teaming with     certified teachers, or special status.<p><b>-STATE-SPECIFIED STUDENT OUTCOMES OR PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES.  </b>Establishing what     students should know and be able to do at particular points in their     schooling.<p>   <b>APPROACH: </b>Does not necessarily dictate pedagogical means; Essential school     students can be expected to meet or exceed these standards, assuming the     outcomes include their learning to think well.<p><b>-STATEWIDE PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS. </b> Measuring established outcome expectations     through large-scale standardized tests.<p>   <b>APPROACH:</b> Essential school students can be expected to meet or exceed these     standards.  Essential schools may propose alternative or additional     assessment measures such as portfolios if the tests do not adequately cover     the school's learning goals.<p><b>-COMPETENCY TESTING.</b>  Assessing students for achievement of basic skills.<p>   <b>APPROACH: </b>Does not necessarily dictate pedagogical means; Essential school     students can be expected to meet or exceed these standards. Schools should     be careful not to emphasize tests in a way that undermines emphasis on     thinking, problem solving, and communication.<p><b>-GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS.</b>  Course requirements and exit examinations for     graduation from high school.<p>   <b>APPROACH: </b>Essential school courses satisfy such requirements even if they are     presented in an interdisciplinary context.

"Two days later, Igot a copy of a letter from our secretary of education to Beverly Anderson atECS, saying Pennsylvania would be delighted to participate and that I would bein charge! All it took was the governor's confirmation and we were started."<p>   With such a dramatic move towards school reform handed to her from above,Wall--a former high school teacher herself--knew she had to muster support fromthe ranks of educators to succeed. "I called the state principals' organization,because I believed so strongly that if a school is going to change the principalhas to be excited about it," she says. "Then I asked the Academy of Learning,which is part of our state system of higher education, to be involved. Theprincipals invited Bob McCarthy of CES to give a presentation at the statewidemeeting of secondary principals, and we invited as observers representatives ofthe state school boards association, the two teachers unions, and thesuperintendents group--about fifty people were there."<p>   Many questions remained after that brief presentation, of course. "We askedthose who were interested to go back to their districts," Wall says, "and talkto their superintendent, representatives from their teachers union, their schoolboard, and their parents group. Then we planned a series of meetings over theyear where they could come together at our expense and talk about what EssentialSchools are all about. For the nine schools who expressed interest, we askedtheir commitment for a full year of planning before they decided to become anEssential School. We gave them $3,000 planning grants that first year. Then, forthose who could make a written commitment to a year of formal planning approvedby their board of education and signed off on by the principal, thesuperintendent, and the teachers union, we gave $25,000 for four teachers tohave release time. In addition, the state reserved $50,000 for activities andpresentations that could help all the schools involved to plan. This year, asthose schools start up their programs, we'll open it to another group of schoolsfor the planning stage." Each school is linked with the closest university inour state system, and a professor from the education department there works withthem throughout the process, supported by a grant from the Academy for Teaching.<p>   The state's main role, as Wall sees it, is as partner to Re:Learning schoolsin overcoming any roadblocks state regulations pose. "Leadership and regulationare the state's two main functions in education," she says. "The leadership isin getting schools involved; and in this case regulation means subtractingrather than adding." <p>                            <hr>                             <h2> Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or comingeditions.

Maybe a teacher wants to center a U.S.history course around a theme like immigration--but the state dictates whattextbooks she must cover. Or a principal might want a special education teacherto be working with the regular program too, so teachers will have no more than80 students yearly to coach in mixed-ability groups--but the fine print rulesagainst it. Or because state achievement exams emphasize coverage over depth,teachers may fear leaving their textbook course outlines.<p>   The state is not a monolith, of course, but a system of people doing theirjobs; and depending on what those people's outlooks are, they can dramaticallyalter the climate in which school change efforts take place. As the EssentialSchool effort snowballs across the country, crucial questions arise as to howthat climate affects the Coalition's struggle for meaningful school reform, andhow statewide strategies can help rather than hinder Essential schools in thattask.<p>   Most CES work involving state systems takes place through Re:Learning, acollaborative effort of the Coalition and the Education Commission of the Statesthat encourages everyone "from schoolhouse to statehouse" to align their goals,policies, and funding in support of Essential School ideas. Eight states--Delaware, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Illinois, Indiana, Arkansas, Colorado, andNew Mexico--have so far signed on with Re:Learning, and several more are close todoing so. In a few other states, such as California and New York, the Coalitionworks through large regional networks of schools, but because these effortsdepend on privately funded coordinators, they can be cumbersome and unstable;CES now largely limits new membership to states that have joined Re:Learning.<p>   In any case, the Coalition has recognized that true Essential School changeultimately depends on the state's active participation. But each state'srelation to its CES member schools reflects its own politics, personalities, andpriorities; and as individual as each situation are the key questions andsolutions a state will frame.<p>   When a state signs on to Re:Learning, some worry, will school reform becometoo vulnerable to the vagaries of changing administrations? If for politicalreasons a state will not join Re:Learning, can Essential School ideas permeatethe establishment anyway, changing the educational climate of a state in other,subtler ways? In either case, is it better to concentrate on building up a fewstrong schools as models of Essential School philosophy, or to spread the effortamong more schools, broadening the political base but risking attempts that mayturn out to be shallow and unpersuasive?<p>   Looking at how Essential schools fare in states where the climate for changeis warm, one confronts many of these dilemmas in all their complexity. NewMexico, for example, which is a Re:Learning state, has focused state efforts onmoving as quickly and broadly as possible to introduce Essential School ideasfrom kindergarten through the college years. The gargantuan Californiaeducational system has not joined Re:Learning, but Essential School principlesshow up in the state's broad efforts to shift fundamental visions of schooling,and in its grant programs for schools moving boldly toward reform. Such effortsto nurture change are as different as a garden hose and an intravenous tube, buteach has had some success.<p>   Achieving systemic change necessarily means altering policies, codes, andregulations; and across the country Essential School advocates are watching withkeen interest as states like these ones begin to imbed many of CES's Nine CommonPrinciples in more enduring forms. California's radically revised curriculumframeworks and its experiments with alternative assessment methods, for example,have much affinity with Essential School ideas. New Mexico has revisedcertification requirements to encourage teacher-generalists, and given the stateboard sweeping authority to waive other rules for experimental schools. AndPennsylvania, a Re:Learning state, has made dramatic changes in the rulesgoverning its curriculum.<p>   How has all this come about in less than a decade? How can such reforms beexpected to fare in the next few years? Some answers may emerge from a closelook at two states' journeys toward change, and at how Essential Schools figurein their plans for the future.<p><hr><h2>California Embraces Change</h2><hr>When school reform became a hot issue in 1983 in California, the nation sat upand took notice. California claims one in seven of the nation's public schoolstudents--Los Angeles County alone has as many students as all of New England--andwith its burgeoning immigrant population and a deep fiscal crisis, the stateexemplifies all the toughest problems facing U.S. educators. The 1983 SchoolReform Act, passed in response to public discontent as schools came undernational fire, called for tougher standards, more accountability, and sweepingefficiencies in school management. But old paradigms of schooling--a "back-to-basics" attitude that did not fundamentally question how material was besttaught and learned--still underlay its thinking.<p>   Gradually, though, state initiatives launched under the Reform Act's auspicesbegan to push against and test those old assumptions. The new Californiacurriculum frameworks became known nationwide for reflecting state-of-the-artthinking on math, science, and writing across the curriculum. A state-sponsorednetwork of "Subject Matter Projects" involved teachers in summer study groups todevelop and spread such ideas. Senate Bill 1882 provided an infusion of moneyfor staff development; the California State Leadership Academy encouragedadministrators to become instructional leaders in these new efforts. A programcalled Every Student Succeeds (ESS) funneled funds to schools trying new ways tointegrate students at risk of failure back into their core curricular programs;and another provided health and social services to kids in need. A task forcereport called "Caught in the Middle" suggested new visions of middle schools'purpose and means. And the Business Roundtable, an association of the state'stop 75 private employers, lent its weight and support to selected changeefforts.<p>   In this new atmosphere, the Coalition of Essential Schools became aninfluential ally to those who saw improving curriculum and pedagogy as the heartof school reform. Because it was not formally connected with the statebureaucracy, some observers say, the Coalition could serve as a "criticalfriend" to schools and state people alike. From its place as a nationally knownoutsider, it could both provoke and enable, challenge and support the growingstatewide conversation about learning, and point out the implications forschools of what the state was doing.<p>   "We were outside the system, so we could be an advocate at every level," saysSteve Jubb, who now coordinates the Northern California Essential School effort."We weren't just a friend to Mr. Teacher, or a friend to Mary in the educationoffice. And no one was paying for our services, so we could be disinterested--weweren't seen as trying to protect our jobs."<p>   The formal Essential School effort in California, however, stayed in thediscussion stages until the late 1980s. The Coalition did have two regionalcoordinators--Maggie Szabo in the San Francisco Bay area and David Marsh, aUniversity of Southern California professor, in the Los Angeles region--to fieldquestions from interested schools, and they ran workshops bringing in peoplefrom Essential schools in other states. But about that time Judy Codding, whohad led two early Essential school efforts in Westchester County, New York, tookover in 1988 as head of Pasadena High School and Coalition ideas found theirfirst large-scale arena in California. "At last we had a school to bear witnessto our ideas," Coalition Chairman Theodore Sizer says.<p><hr><h2>How the Ideas Spread</h2><hr>Today, the Coalition in Southern California has its own network of experiencedEssential School people in active contact with each other as "critical friends"and coaches. Maggie Szabo has moved into a state position directing an ambitiousprogram of grants for school restructuring under Senate Bill 1274--the guidelinesfor which, signed by Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig, deeplyreflect the Coalition's Nine Common Principles. Along with Szabo, David Marshand Judy Codding serve on the state's new Task Force on High Schools, in whosefar-reaching final report Essential School ideas will figure prominently.Coalition thinking was very influential in revising the training materials that1,500 school administrators have worked with in the California State LeadershipAcademy. Schools are working with state-led projects on new assessmentpractices, and the California Assessment Program (CAP) has begun to introducenew performance-oriented measures into its testing program.<p>   And all eyes are riveted on the changes under way at Pasadena High School, alarge urban school staggering under the kinds of problems that face the entirestate--dropouts, drugs, the weight of a dead curriculum with no relation to amulticultural population approaching the 21st century. In Codding's first fewyears Pasadena's faculty reorganized itself into five houses, began to crossdisciplinary lines and strip the curriculum of non-essentials, and wrestledbudgets to put close knowledge of students by teachers at the top of itspriority list. Students now show up regularly and their grades are rising,Codding's figures show, though she bears battle scars-- from a walkout strike bystudents and teachers when she moved inter-scholastic athletics out of theformal school day, for example.<p>   Pasadena is just one of the showcase schools that typify the strategy ofCalifornia's school reform movement in general and of Essential School reformhere in particular. At Santa Monica's Lincoln Middle School, a flourishingEssential school, Ilene Straus was named the state's Principal of the Year bythe National Association of Secondary School Principals. In nearby OrangeCounty, Judy Cunningham and Rancho San Joaquin Middle School have won a widereputation for Essential School practices. To provide support and coaching forteachers within the schools and nearby, the Coalition has clustered a number ofits National Re:Learning Faculty members in each of these schools, and all havegrown used to troops of visitors flocking through their halls.<p>   Some of these model schools, but not all, have benefited by special stategrants, which augment the average $4,100-per-pupil expenditure that ranksCalifornia among the lowest in the nation in per-pupil spending. The situationvividly illustrates California's strategy of inspiring change in the many bypaying for change in the few. Last year, under Senate Bill 1274, 212 schoolsreceived planning grants to help them envision their restructuring. This year,if the legislature votes funds for it, the state will select more schools--notnecessarily the same ones, or even as many--to receive additional money for thenext five years as "demonstration schools."<p>   In choosing its grant recipients, the state looks for a spread acrossachievement records and socio-economic levels; some good schools with ambitiousprograms resent the system because it leaves them dependent on local taxoverrides or business partnerships. On the positive side, several of the state'sinitiatives (such as professional development and restructuring grants) dovetailneatly around new visions of teaching and learning. And the state'srestructuring goals--"a thinking-centered, meaning-centered curriculum, pedagogy,and assessment, combined with dramatically bold and effective school anddistrict structures and practices"--read like an Essential School manifesto forchange.<p>   Without Re:Learning to organize Essential School change in California, theCoalition has relied on an extraordinary network of regional contact people paidby private foundations, universities, and even county or district systems. (TheSan Francisco Foundation bankrolls virtually all the Northern California effort;and the Ahmandson, ARCO, Drown, and Hearst Foundations are major contributors inthe South.) It even seems possible that state restructuring efforts mayintertwine with Coalition efforts to such an extent that the practicalobjectives of Re:Learning could be achieved without a formal commitment. Forexample, a "lead person" in each of California's ten main geographical regions,paid by the state restructuring office, provides encouragement and support forschools applying for grants. And because the restructuring guidelines mesh soclosely with Essential School ideas, Northern California Coalition coordinatorSteve Jubb is besieged by schools asking him for help. Jubb is stretched so thinthat he wants his job to be split into several new positions, perhapscorrelating with the regions of the county school system.<p>   A solid base of support at the University of Southern California provides astructure for efforts in that part of the state. "I spend one day a week as theCES Southern California coordinator," explains David Marsh, a professor ofeducation at USC. "One day a week the state pays me to go to Pasadena High to betheir Ôschool coach.' One of my doctoral students, Cathy Armstrong, is ateachers union representative and CES coordinator at a large urban high school,so she can represent the Coalition. Another USC doctoral student, Ilene Straus,is a Thomson Fellow on the Coalition's National Re:Learning Faculty, as is JudyCunningham, principal at Rancho San Joaquin. We have Steve Poynter, a teacher atPasadena, a Citibank Faculty Member, and a USC student. We have Julie Quinn,another USC student who directs staff development for the Glendale SchoolDistrict. Mike Goldman comes in for a week every month, from his half-time postwith New Mexico's Re:Learning, to work in the L.A. region. That's a lot ofinfluence, a lot of voices to spread the word."<p>   Although California's new state policies are well focused by Essential Schoolstandards, Marsh acknowledges, the state's success is still moderate, itsperformance bad, and its funding terrible. Still, he says, for a state in adisastrous educational and financial situation, things look pretty good to him."If you can get four big districts to have a small set of transformed schools,"he argues, "you'll be moving very fast." The danger, he warns, is "devising 100programs to address 100 problems," and he credits Maggie Szabo in therestructuring office with writing "brilliant guidelines" with which schools canidentify their central problems. "I'd rather deal with these dilemmas," Marshsays emphatically, "than let every school do it on their own."<p><hr><h2>Re:Learning in New Mexico</h2><hr>School reform was also launched in New Mexico in 1983 with a "back-to-basics"school reform act rooted in more requirements, more regulations, an old-styleindustrial model of schools made more efficient. By 1988, when an influentialgroup of five well-placed educators made the trip to Milton, Massachusetts for agroundbreaking Coalition summer workshop, the state was chafing against what itviewed as top-down change, and was ripe for more substantive, teacher-drivenclassroom reforms.<p>   Now, barely three years after New Mexico joined Re:Learning, the state is upto its ears in Essential School ideas, running an intensive effort to reorientits 88 school districts from kindergarten through post-secondary levels. Thestate presents an astonishing picture of determination and speed, a mix madepossible, at least in part, by the personalities and placement of the initialfive people whose interest in Essential Schooling got the whole thing startedhere on virtually no funds except a grant from Panasonic and the administrativesupport of Eastern New Mexico University.<p>   New Mexico is a huge state geographically, the fourth largest in the nation;but unlike its sprawling cousin, California, it is small in numbers and itseducational establishment is close-knit. "Superintendents and principals heretend to know what each other are doing," says Jeanne Knight, the state'sAssociate Superintendent and head of the cadre charged with developing andarticulating Re:Learning's goals. That fact helped when Knight attended the 1988Milton Coalition workshop, accompanied by Marlis Mann, aide to then GovernorGarrey Carruthers; the late Eddie Ortiz, then the influential superintendent ofSanta Fe's school district; Judy Duval, a teacher now with Re:Learning's NewMexico offices; and Hayes Lewis, the superintendent of the Zuni schools, one oftwo Native American school districts in the country.<p>   The five represented such an inclusive spread of school people, and theirpersonal influence was so marked in the state, that Essential School ideas wonwidespread acceptance throughout the system early on. All agree that a powerfulearly spokesman for the effort was Governor Carruthers, a change-mindedRepublican who chaired the Education Commission of the States; and the help ofEastern New Mexico University was also indispensable. But the state's swiftcommitment to Re:Learning has now handily survived a change of administrationunder Democratic Governor Bruce King, the death of the charismatic Ortiz,opposition by right-wing elements, and yearly funding decisions by a legislaturewith unusually direct control over the state's school budget.<p>   Part of that political stability can be credited to an extraordinary effortto disseminate the Essential School idea of "student as worker," at the veryleast, widely throughout the state, from kindergarten through college andteacher education programs. Though most schools are only in the earliest stagesof exploring what that might mean in action, Essential School vocabulary iseverywhere; thousands of teachers, parents, administrators, and schoolorganizations have already participated in Re:Learning activities and awarenesssessions.<p>   New Mexico Re:Learning goes about its mission from an unused elementaryschool in Santa Fe, its tiny staff headed by Pedro Atencio, a widely admired,soft-spoken, intense former principal of Santa Fe's Sweeney Elementary School,committed to involving teachers, parents, board members, and administrators aswidely as possible. To do that he relies heavily on the Coalition's "Trek"concept, a year-long framework that helps school envision and carry out change.This year some 250 school people who are farther along in the process served as"Essential Friends" to partner schools, "trekking them" through the phases ofchange. New Mexico's universities are a key part of this effort; they grantgraduate credit to teachers for work on Trek activities, and they help sponsortask forces where networks of teachers share expertise in particular subjectareas.<p>   With Judy Duval and Michael Goldman (a former teacher at New York City'sCentral Park East Secondary School), Atencio has used the Trek strategy todecentralize the state's effort, spreading $619,000 in Re:Learning funds thisyear among some 50 schools in five large geographical regions, at an average ofaround $10,000 per school. Next year Re:Learning is asking for $1.5 millionmore, as schools now in the exploratory and design stages begin to carry outtheir plans. A matching grant from Southwestern Bell supplements state funding.And New Mexico is waiting hopefully for word on a five-year National ScienceFoundation grant that would put $2 million more yearly toward efforts to changecurriculum and instruction in ways closely compatible with Essential Schoolideas.<p>   Atencio and his staff acknowledge that their ambitious strategy means a largenumber of New Mexico schools are in the earliest phases of change, still comingto terms with the failings of the traditional system and exploring new options.But they point out that as regional support is formalized and structures of peersupport (like the Trek) built up, schools should move more quickly and at lesscost through the early stages of restructuring.<p><hr><h2>Restructured Santa Fe</h2><hr>In several districts--Zuni in the West, Albuquerque in the populated center, andLoving in the east are good examples--clusters of schools or even entiredistricts are involved in transforming schools from the early grades throughhigh school along Essential School principles. In the Santa Fe district, forexample, it is easy to imagine a student progressing from Sweeney ElementarySchool to Capshaw Middle School and Capital High School with a thoroughlyconsistent sense of what that education meant--an integrated, student-centeredcurriculum centered around essential themes.<p>   At Sweeney, the district's largest elementary school with a large populationof at-risk children, the school is governed entirely by a seven-personmanagement team made up of teachers, staff, and parents. The climate at Sweeneyis one of striking cooperation, its curriculum dominated by teachers'determination to know their students better in a broad variety of contexts.Older students pair with younger ones as "writing buddies"; teachers regularlyexchange classes with another age group; special education students arethoroughly integrated into regular classes; and students work toward cross-curricular competencies in a cycle of theme-oriented social studies units.<p>   Down the road at Capshaw Middle School, an early grant from PanasonicFoundation helped principal Steve Dilg and his staff articulate a vision thathad much in common with Essential School ideas. Today, four heterogeneouslygrouped "families" of 150 students and five teachers, grouped around commonhallways, take responsibility for their own curriculum planning, scheduling,discipline, and counseling. Two schoolwide questions focus the curriculum, andeach team develops its own interdisciplinary units, enjoying considerableflexibility in scheduling each day's time blocks to suit their needs. An eighth-grade class led by Kermit Hill, for instance, explores the essential questions"What is love?" and "Why do humans fight?" by exploring the pivotal Civil Warbattle at Gettysburg from several perspectives, culminating in a re-enactment ofthe battle on the school playing fields.<p>   The school obtained a waiver from the state to reflect its interdisciplinarycommitment in a checklist of exit competencies that focus on demonstrated"essential skills" across the curriculum. Teachers use a variety of assessmentmeasures, including portfolios; presentations, and open-ended questions; andeighth graders demonstrate their readiness to graduate in a public "rite ofpassage" exhibition.<p>   At Santa Fe's four-year-old Capital High School, the seminar-based Gatewaysprogram combines literature, history, philosophy, and the arts in mixed-agegroups that use long schedule blocks to explore themes like power and authority,myths and legends, or human rights. Other departments, from math and science toforeign language, are at earlier stages of incorporating Essential Schoolprinciples. But teachers say it will take more state help in terms ofprofessional development, revised assessment methods, and autonomy in teachingmaterials to involve the whole school with Re:Learning's goals.<p><hr><h2>Have State Rules Changed?</h2><hr>Even though few bold changes have been encoded in New Mexico's education laws,any school with a plan for change now stands a good chance of getting itthrough. Last year, the legislature gave New Mexico's state education board theauthority to grant waivers from state regulations to experimental schools. Otherchanges are written right into the law: to encourage teachers to be generalists,the state now offers only 25 areas of certification, down from 154, and requiresthem to demonstrate techniques integrating disciplines. Another area of progressis assessment; an education department statewide task force is working tointegrate cross-disciplinary performance-based competencies into the stateachievement exams. "Even if Re:Learning were to pass on," says Jeanne Knight,"the state board is working to ensure that the structure it stands for wouldremain."<p>   The Coalition also has friends in the State House, where Governor Bruce Kingand an active First Lady managed an extraordinarily smooth transition forRe:Learning after its powerful start under Governor Carruthers. "The wholeeffort could have collapsed when the new governor came in," says Pedro Atencio."But Caroline Gaston, the Kings' aide on education, worked hard to lobby forRe:Learning in the legislature, bringing in the business community and nationalsupport from places like the American Association for the Advancement ofScience." Gaston, who is a powerhouse of energy, also advises the governor onchildren's services, family issues, and substance abuse. Working with a nationalnonprofit group called Cities in Schools (CIS), New Mexico schools may soonbecome community centers for such matters, if Gaston has her way.<p>   Even with the steady support of New Mexico's educational establishment,Re:Learning faces other frustrations. The state's teacher pay scale is among thelowest in the nation, and good teachers are continually being hired away toother states, fragmenting the base on which the Re:Learning strategy depends.Few schools have yet requested waivers on matters of textbooks and testing, andthey have little control over class size, which is determined by thelegislature. (Characteristically, in this case Pedro Atencio makes a virtue ofnecessity. "Instead of starting with site-based management and not knowing whatto use it for," he says, "our schools will have to start with a vision thatcreates a need for site-based management. The legislators will catch up.")<p>   "Our real obstacle," Jeanne Knight says, "is not so much state policies. Itis in our own heads--the traditional passive learning model that so many peopletake for granted. Everybody wants to be part of Re:Learning, partly because itcarries money for schools. But few realize how hard it is to really do it. Theyget caught into thinking that if they just do cooperative learning, they'refine."<p>   Re:Learning can provide a statewide FORM for school restructuring, Knightargues, but the substance must grow from a deeper understanding of EssentialSchool principles. It's risky, Knight says, to rely primarily on classroomteachers relatively inexperienced in their own school's transformation to prodand coach other schools as they go through the same process. (It is not unusualin New Mexico for someone to begin the Trek process during one school year andlead a Trek workshop the next.) "We need those teachers in their own classrooms,improving substance there," Knight says. "I'd like to see ten or twelve of thestate board's staff people deeply trained to serve that critical friend functioninstead." And, although the state is busy redefining school leadership toinclude more than just the principal, Knight wants to focus on one person ineach district--whether a coordinator, a principal, or a superintendent--who willbe thoroughly coached by Essential School people in addition.<p>   What can be drawn from a look at how these states have approached EssentialSchool change system-wide? No two states are alike in makeup or politics, afterall, and every such difference will dictate different routes to change. Whatstates that are making progress seem to have in common, though, is both anelected leadership that endorses change and strong independent leaders in theeducational establishment who can develop long-ranging new policies and put theminto place.<p>   Aside from that, states can help by sending strong signals to schools as tothe route they want them to take, as New Mexico has done. They can give moneyand technical assistance to local schools in pursuing that vision, as NewMexico's Re:Learning funds and California's SB 1274 have achieved. They can setpositive directions in curriculum, as California and Pennsylvania demonstrate,and follow that through with authentic assessment strategies, as is slowlyhappening in California and New Mexico. They can provide new visions--not preciseblueprints, but reports like California's "Caught in the Middle"--on how schoolsmight look in the future. They can revise their credentialing and preparationrequirements for teachers, involving university schools of education as allthree of these states are doing.<p>   These are neither "top-down" nor "bottom-up" efforts, in the old language ofpolitical change. Rather, they are powerful collaborations across all levels.They remind us that if it is to work, people THROUGH-OUT a state system mustengage with school change--making it happen in their classrooms, their offices,and their chambers; making it matter to all the key stakeholders; and takingpower on behalf of their children, whose futures will affect them all. <p><hr>    <h2>Changing a State's Regulations: How Pennsylvania Has Done It</h2><hr>Whether they are Re:Learning schools or not, Pennsylvania schools this yearreceived the first unambiguous message that new principles now underlie what thestate expects from a public education. The State Board of Education circulatedin September a 100-page document that redefines state curriculum and assessmentregulations; after extensive public discussion and revision, it will takeeffect.<p>   Gone are the rules dictating how many minutes must be spent each year in howmany subjects to accumulate so many credits; gone are the narrow distinctionsbetween vocational and academic tracks; gone is the focus on setting minimumstandards and diagnosing individual student deficiencies through standardizedtests. In their place is a thorough and deep articulation of "higher orderlearning outcomes" that sets high expectations for what students should know andbe able to do. Assessment, in turn, will test the strengths and weaknesses ofschool programs in meeting the expected outcomes, allowing local assessment todetermine individual student proficiency.<p>   The state's new goals revolve around specific "learning outcomes" that wouldteach students to think critically, develop a sense of self-worth, learnindependently and collaboratively, adapt to change, and make ethical judgments.These habits of mind show up in specific recommendations for cross-disciplinarycurriculum areas ranging from communications to science and technology, the artsand humanities, citizenship, and career education.<p>   The changes reflect an intensive two years of effort including many publicmeetings aimed at involving parents, educators, business leaders, and thecommunity. The language of the new regulations shows marked Essential Schoolinfluence; key CES and ECS staff met with the state board, and Re:Learningpeople attended every public meeting to represent the Coalition's point of view.Adopted under Democratic Governor Robert Casey in 1988, Re:Learning is thestate's primary school reform initiative but not its only one.<p>   "The message is clear to Pennsylvania schools, Re:Learning schools or not,"says Jean di Sabatino, the state's Re:Learning coordinator. "Everyone is goingto have to change to come in line with the state guidelines. Somehow it makesthe changes seem less radical, which is good for resistant schools."<p>   Indeed, resistance to Essential School ideas is as present in Pennsylvania asanywhere. "We had 250 parents show up last week at a meeting in Lancaster,worried about eliminating tracking if an Essential School program was extendedin one school," says Pat Smith, a CES Senior Associate who serves as liaison tothe Pennsylvania effort. And teacher unions have voiced fears that eliminatingcourse requirements could encourage schools in fiscal trouble to cut back onprograms.<p>   "This state is a good barometer for school change nationwide," Pat Smithobserves. "Most of its schools already consider themselves good, though they arenot unreceptive to reform. But because their problems are not desperate theytend to be somewhat conservative about change." The state's mix of rural andurban districts and its political balance of power, agrees the state board's BobFier, makes it "about as close to mainstream America as I've seen."<p>   The new curriculum regulations imply teachers who are differently prepared,able to cross disciplinary lines and comfortable with the role of coach asstudents learn in more active ways. Indeed, the next big step for Pennsylvania'sboard is revising its teacher certification regulations, and it intends to usethe same process over the next year in doing so. "The most productive route willbe to work with higher education people to change teacher preparation," saysFier. The state's university system is already closely allied with theRe:Learning effort, serving as close partners to Re:Learning schools and placingstudent teachers there as "junior colleagues" in the change effort.<p>   Schools will play out the new regulations in their own ways, Bob Fierpredicts, but now that their concepts are embedded in the state code,recognizable Essential School patterns are likely to show up fairly consistentlyin the next three to five years.  "The political reality is that public schoolsdon't have much time to prove they're going to do things differently," he says."We've had to move very swiftly for the kind of changes we're talking about."<p><hr>              <h2> A Tribe Transforms Its Schools:                                The Zuni Story</h2><hr>The public schools of Zuni, New Mexico provide a striking example of EssentialSchool principles adapted to a particular community's needs and vision. When hefirst launched his native Zuni tribe on school change ten years ago,superintendent Hayes Lewis broke with a larger district to carve out anautonomous K-12 district for this reservation of 9,200. In a series of boldmoves including withdrawing from the state accreditation system, he and hiscurriculum director, Kirby Gchachu, a friend since childhood, asked the entiretribal community to help decide what they wanted for their children.<p>        "We had the state's highest dropout rate, its lowest achievement, poorattendance, and low parental involvement," Lewis says. "The community asked fora high-quality academic program with learning opportunities in and out of thebuildings; power over making decisions and solving our problems; and an emphasison Zuni culture, history, and language throughout the curriculum."<p>        Today students at Zuni's alternative Twin Buttes High School are preparingfor an oral and written presentation answering a key question that faces theirtribe: how to spend the Zuni Land Reclamation money the tribe has just received.In a cross-disciplinary unit that incorporates government and law, land use,economics, history, math and science, and research, writing, and speakingskills, they will reflect on questions that have real and immediate meaning tothe entire community.<p>        Both Twin Buttes and the larger Zuni High School schedule four long blocksinto each school day, and teachers have grown accustomed to acting asgeneralists in several subject areas. The district is in a pilot assessmentproject with the state, developing new ways to document student performance. AndLewis speaks soberly of the need to keep up a steady evaluation of each new moveto avoid stagnation in the process.<p>        For the Zuni district, New Mexico's Re:Learning effort came at just theright time, Lewis observes, and the process for joining it closely mirrored thetraditional tribal methods of consensus decision-making. But the district mustnow act swiftly and boldly, he says. "The community is behind us, the board isbehind us, and the administrators are in place," he says. "Now is our time toact; it may be our only chance."<p><hr>           <h2>NY's Essential Schools: Partners With The State</h2><hr>In New York, a dramatic shift in the state's education policy statement hasdirectly involved Essential schools as key exemplars of school change. In fall1991, as part of their ambitious "New Compact for Learning" reform agenda, thestate's Regents adopted a "Partnership Schools Program" aimed at getting schoolsto try bold new alternatives to traditional schooling. The first group ofschools named to the program consisted entirely of members of the Coalition ofEssential Schools.<p>   "This puts us squarely in the center of the state's reform movement," saysthe CES regional coordinator for New York, Joan Carney. "This program not onlygives public recognition to the New York Essential schools that have come sofar; it will also allow their work to proceed and go deeper." Carney and anumber of New York's Essential school leaders met often with EducationCommissioner Thomas Sobol and State Education Department people over the pastseveral years as they drafted the New Compact for Learning.<p>   Each school in the partnership will work with a state liaison person toobtain waivers from state policies and practices, such as curriculum mandates,that have made restructuring difficult. "Even more important," says Carney,"we'll be working toward defining new learning outcomes and developingalternative assessment practices, perhaps including waivers from the state'sRegents exam requirements."<p>   For their part, New York's Essential schools will provide key guidance toState Education Department people, as well as a vision of how future schoolsmight look to those that follow them in the Partnership Program. Coalitionschool people from the region will also sit on the state's oversight committeefor the new program.<p>   "This is a loud and clear message from the state to those schools that mighthave regarded Essential School ideas as somehow aberrant," says Carney. "Thestate has given us its imprimatur; we are in the mainstream now."<p>                               <hr>                             <h2> Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or comingeditions.

Essential school teachers have been working foryears to dispelthe "excruciating boredom" by engaging students actively inmeaningfulwork, and to replace the "stark terror" of periodic orirrelevanttesting with authentic exhibitions of mastery.<p>   But as Coalition member schools try to make assessmentintegral toevery classroom action, policy efforts to create and enforcehigherstandards in education are going on in their state capitals,in the U.S.Congress and Cabinet, and in the meeting rooms ofprofessional andscholarly organizations. How will this often confusing arrayof activityaffect the daily routines of schooling? What can Essentialschools do tounderstand and influence the policies that may shape theirfuture?<p>   Beginning in the Bush Administration and now continuingunderPresident Clinton, state and federal policymakers alarmed byU.S.students' poor standing against their global competitorshave pushed fornew accountability measures. The 1989 "education summit" inCharlottesville, Virginia gathered 50 governors who agreedon broadgoals for school improvement by the year 2000, and a numberof stateslaunched ambitious restructuring efforts in its wake. Now anAdministration peopled by former governors-from Bill ClintontoEducation Secretary Richard W. Riley and Riley's deputy,Madeline Kunin-is following hard upon state heels with a plan to definenationalstandards and goals, measure progress toward them, andreward thosestates that align their policies with them.<p>   Known as the "Goals 2000: Educate America Act," thecurrent billcreates a structure in which the federal governmentauthorizes majordisciplinary groups to articulate content standards in theirfields fora National Education Standards and Improvement Council. Iturges statesand districts voluntarily to develop their own studentperformancestandards and assessments-and later, standards governing"opportunity tolearn"-which that Council would approve and certify. And itsupplies anunspecified amount of money to support state and localschool reformefforts.<p>   Goals 2000 will most likely not withhold other federaleducationalfunds (which fuel much of state education departments'budgets) ifstates choose not to go along. But its national educationgoals gainmuscle indirectly as the Elementary and Secondary EducationAct(E.S.E.A.) comes simultaneously before Congress forreauthorization,linking distribution of Chapter 1 funds to whether stateshave alignedtheir standards for all students with the goals.<p>   Now schools that have been struggling to keep up withtheir states'new curriculum frameworks and accountability requirementsmay for thefirst time find those policies reinforced by the federalgovernment. Atthe same time, the political scramble to define "whatstudents shouldknow and be able to do" gets ever more complex andcontradictory.<p>   Over a dozen national subject-area associations huddleseparatelyover content standards that outdo each other in sweepinggoals; but nomechanism exists to integrate these goals so a teacher canrealisticallyattempt to meet them in the crowded school day. Statelegislatures andeducation departments debate "performance outcomes" thatdefine thethinking skills students must master across the disciplines,but fewassessments of such skills exist, so schools and studentsare stillrated and selected by the multiple-choice measures of thepast.<p>   And many school people express fury at the hypocrisy of asystem thatholds them accountable for improving student performancewithout holdingpolitical authorities accountable for providing adequatesupport forschools.<p>   Despite the inherent contradictions in the currentpoliticaldiscourse, however, Essential School leaders recognize theimportance ofworking with policymakers to reach their shared objective ofmorerigorous standards for all American students. "Just as weask schoolsto stay with the hard work of doing honest and meaningfulstudentassessment," says CES Chairman Theodore Sizer, "we must workfor thebest possible resolution at the national policy level. Wemay not agreeon all the means by which these standards are achieved, butwe arecommitted to staying in the conversation."<p>   Coalition member schools have a crucial role to play inthisdiscussion, Sizer points out. To start with, they arealready engaged inasking themselves what they want of their students and howthey willknow when they have it. As they pioneer new strategies ofcurriculum andpedagogy that challenge all students to master essentialthinkingskills, and as they exhibit the results in new forms ofassessment, alleyes will be on them.<p>   "We have a head start on the accountability issue in manyways,"Sizer observes, "because of our long-standing emphasis onpublicexhibitions of student work before the local community." Andbecause theEssential School principles stress assessment as a key stepin learning,not an ad hoc event that occurs after teaching and learningare done,they bring an important perspective to the nationaldiscussion abouttesting.<p>   Instead of worrying about whether their actions will fitwhatever newpolicy shoe is poised to fall, Coalition leaders say,Essential schoolsshould lobby hard for their states to give them latitude,support, and asignificant voice in the setting of state standards. If theysucceed,the state can help them take a giant step forward, out ofisolation andinto a network of shared resources, shared philosophy, andsubstantiverewards from college admissions to funding partnerships.<p>   "The time has never been more ripe for Essentialschools," declaresSherry King, superintendent of the Croton-Harmon schooldistrict in NewYork's Hudson River Valley. "A lot of legislation out thereissupporting what we believe in." New York's educational Boardof Regents,indeed, has approved a "New Compact for Learning" thatembraces theEssential School philosophy in virtually all its aspects.<p>   But as other education departments write their ownprescriptions forstate-by-state reform, Coalition member schools might lookhard at theassumptions that underlie those standard-setting procedures.The bigissue now is not whether but how state and nationalstandards andassessments will drive the schools of the future. Thecritical questionsaffecting everyone from the first-year teacher through thehighest levelof policymakers revolve around who defines and developsthose standards,by what means student progress toward them is assessed, andhow theresulting information is to be used.<p><hr><h2>Who Will Set Standards?</h2><hr>Tensions are already evident between teacher-generated and"top down"efforts to define standards and between subject-areaemphases and cross-disciplinary ones. In a flagship effort at standard-settingthat won high praise for its participatory process, theNational Councilof Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) recast its K-12curriculum, puttinginquiry and problem-solving at the center of how studentslearn math.Schoolteachers worked closely with university professors andmathematicians on developing the curricular standards andprovidingpractical guidelines for teachers on how to put them intoplace. Actualclassroom change has been creaky and laborious, mostlybecause the NCTMstandards represent a dramatic shift from how almost everyU.S. student(though not those in other countries) has learned math inthis century.The new standards literally require a fundamental re-education ofteachers and parents-an early warning, many critics believe,to thosewho think new standards can change schools withoutsubstantialinvestment of time and resources.<p>   In eight other subject areas- science, history,geography, civics,English, foreign languages, the arts, and physicaleducation-professional and scholarly organizations are currently atwork onstandards of their own. Many of these efforts are funded atvaryinglevels by the U.S. Department of Education, and they willprobablydefine the federal government's approved "content areastandards." Someof them include teachers in their process; others keep theirdistancefrom the messy realities of the classroom.<p>   Also at the federal level, a very different set ofstandards has beenput forward by the Labor Department's Secretary's CommissiononAchieving Necessary Skills (SCANS) report. This document,which takes across-disciplinary perspective, defines the workplace skillshigh schoolgraduates need to succeed in the new economy, and itreflects on meansto assess those skills. Though not technically part of theGoals 2000initiative, it has already played a substantial role in thenationaldiscourse on standard-setting. <p>   The same tensions inherent in these few examples show upas statedepartments of education struggle to come up with their ownnewdefinitions of student success and ways to measure it. Somestatesinclude teachers early on; others start with high-level taskforces andlobby for general acceptance later on. Some states start bydefiningsubject-area "curriculum frameworks"; others cross thedisciplines todescribe "learning outcomes" in terms of thinking skills.All the while,the states and the federal education department are eyeingeach otherwarily, wondering if the plans of one may pose a threat tothe other.<p><hr><h2>How to Assess Students?</h2><hr>The answers may hang, in the end, on what means those intenton schoolaccountability use to assess student progress. Again, anarray ofpossibilities presents itself, from the top to the bottom oftheeducational bureaucracy.<p>   The original Bush plan to include a national test in thelegislation(which was then dubbed "America 2000") met with so muchprotest that itwas dropped; but many policymakers still hope that test-makers willinvent a way to "calibrate" state tests so that studentscores will becomparable across the country. A number of states areputting theirmoney into developing or buying new tests that emphasizeopen-endedquestions, problem-solving strategies, essays, and other"performance"tasks. This, reformers hope, will encourage teachers tospend more classtime on practicing the higher-order skills that old-styletests ignorein-depth reading and discussion, research and invention,solving complexproblems, initiating projects, and creating original work.<p>   California, for instance, recently started giving allstudents ingrades 4, 8, and 10 in several subjects its CaliforniaLearningAssessment System (CLAS) tests, a combination of open-ended,in-depthquestions and "enhanced multiple-choice" questions thatrequire morecomplex thinking. The tests, which are teacher-scored, ratestudents ona criterion-referenced proficiency scale rather than usingthe old-stylenorm-referenced system.<p>   In addition, California is encouraging teachers to useportfolios asan ongoing, classroom-based performance assessment. Onepilot programhas teachers in grades K-12 learning to document studentprogress acrossthe curriculum by means of the California Learning Record,an adaptationof the observation-based British Primary Language Recordthat has wonhigh praise for its usefulness with multilingual populationsand itsinvolvement of parents and students.<p>   New York's New Compact for Learning calls for acombination ofclassroom-based and state-assisted assessment that uniquelyreflectsEssential School thinking. (See sidebar 1.) The state wouldwork closelywith schools to support local development of assessmentprograms thatfit each school's goals and curriculum and to provide accessto a bankof assessment tasks and instruments. Graduation would followcompletionof a "Regents Portfolio" that exhibits competency across thecurriculumas defined in the state's list of desired "learningoutcomes." Alongwith Central Park East Secondary School, Urban Academy, andUniversityHeights High School in New York, six new "Coalition Campus"high schoolsbegun in New York City this year already specify "graduationbyexhibition" of specific cross-disciplinary tasks. <p>   The Kentucky Instructional Results Information System(KIRIS)concentrates on assessing six instructional goals: basicskills, coreconcepts, self-sufficiency, group membership, problemsolving, andintegration of knowledge. Each year all students in grades4, 8, and 12must take conventional multiple-choice tests; but they arealso assessedusing classroom-based performance tasks and portfolios oftheir bestwork. In addition, teachers of students in other grades areurged toincorporate continuous performance assessments into dailyactivities.<p>   Connecticut's Common Core of Learning outlines what thestate's highschool graduates should know and be able to do, and since1989 itseducation department has been working on math and scienceperformanceassessments that reflect these goals. They rely largely ontasksembedded in the curriculum, which last from a few days to aweek ormore; students design and carry out investigations includinggatheringdata, solving problems, and presenting their work orally andin writing.Teachers are coached in how to prepare and score students,and the statealso annually evaluates a random sample of eleventh gradersagainst thegoals of the Common Core of Learning.<p>   Vermont's ambitious new assessment system requires allteachers ingrades 4 and 8 to keep portfolios of students' best work inmathematicsand writing. Teacher-run regional networks train them inselectingappropriate tasks and scoring them according to a finelytuned rubric;visiting committees validate each school's scores byrescoring randomportfolios. The state supplements this information with aconventionaltest with which to compare districts' progress.<p>   Meanwhile, whether or not their state is involved inredrafting itsstandards and expectations, many reform-minded districts andschoolshave taken the lead in experimenting with classroom-basedalternativeassessments like portfolios, projects, and exhibitions.<p>   In Pittsburgh, the ARTS PROPEL portfolio program, whichis linkedwith the Performance Assessment Collaboratives for Education(PACE)group at Harvard University, assesses student progress inwriting andthe arts by means of "processfolios," as Harvard's DenniePalmer Wolfhas dubbed them These include not only a student's best workbut thedrafts that led up to them, adding to the folder thecritical element ofstudent self-reflection. Another pioneer of district-levelperformanceassessment is San Diego, where the CES-affiliated O'FarrellCommunitySchool is a leader.<p>   And in many individual Essential school classrooms,teachers havesimilarly begun embedding ongoing assessment tasks in thecurriculumitself, rather than treating them as separate from the restof teachingand learning. Projects, exhibitions, and demonstrations allofferwindows into student progress that can inform curriculardecisions on anindividual and a program level.<p><hr><h2>Which Tests Do What</h2><hr>Amid all this experimentation, states are continuallylooking for bettermethods of holding their schools accountable to the largercommunity-ranking and comparing one to the other within the state andeven acrossthe nation. And even states in the midst of reform, itseems, like toget their data for such comparisons from standardized tests(eitherconventional or "performance-based") that they give eitherto everystudent or to a statistical sample selected at random. Atthe heart ofany decision to use one kind of assessment instrument overanother ishow the results are scored.<p>   Conventional standardized tests are commonly scored usinga norm-referenced system, in which scores compare how one studentdid on thetest compared to some other group of test-takers answeringthe samequestions. The point is to provide a general gauge-usuallyin the areaof basic skills-of individual achievement and schoolsuccess.<p>   Conventional testing continues to be widespread in manyplaces. Suchtests as the Metropolitan Achievement Test, the Iowa Test ofBasicSkills, and the Stanford Achievement Test are required forChapter 1funding. School districts in many states use them for othersorting andselecting purposes as well, and also as their principalaccountabilitydevice; local newspapers often report schools' averagescores, forexample.<p>   An important disadvantage of norm-referenced tests isthat the dataare often ambiguous or even meaningless when one tries tointerpretthem. For example, using average test scores to decidewhether a schoolis showing improvement in its program has a fundamentalflaw, asColumbia's Linda Darling-Hammond and others point out. Aschool'saverage overall performance can "improve" simply by jugglingwho takesthe test-by labeling more students for special education tocount themout, for instance. And it can "decline" if a school has asudden influxof children who need help the most-non-English speakers, forexample -no matter how good a job it may be doing.<p>   A still more serious disadvantage is that teaching tosuch tests inorder to boost scores can actually hurt students' realintellectualachievement, since the test format emphasizes isolated low-level skills.<p>   Advocates of performance-based testing call instead forcriterion-referenced scoring, which measures how individual studentsdo onspecific tasks. Instead of reporting, for example, that theaverageeighth grader scored 60 percent on a standard test ofwritten English, acriterion-referenced test might reveal that 60 percent ofeighth gradersdid not use evidence well in writing an explanatory essay.<p>   One proponent of this approach is the New StandardsProject, aheavily funded research effort involving eighteen states andheaded byLauren Resnick at the University of Pittsburgh and MarcTucker at theNational Center on Education and the Economy. Working withthe nationaldisciplinary organizations, the project aims to fashion anationalexamination system that allows for significant flexibilityanddiscretion at the state and local level.<p><hr><h2>What Is at Stake</h2><hr>Once student performance can be quantified, the results canbe used inmany ways, not all of them consistent with the originalgoals ofperformance-based assessment. Some states reward teachersand schoolswhen their students meet performance standards and imposesanctions whenthey don't. In many states, test scores still serve as ameans to trackstudents into ability groups they will stay in for years. InKentucky,teachers can lose their jobs and schools can lose fundingwhen theydon't come up to snuff. This "high-stakes" reasoning istantamount,Darling-Hammond charges, to ranking hospitals by theirmortality rates."They would get rid of their AIDS units, they would get ridof theircardiac care units, and everyone would go into pediatrics inorder toget their statistics up," she says.<p>   One antidote to possible abuses of this kind, criticssuggest, wouldbe to include other factors with any reports of schoolwidescores. RhodeIsland, for example, has begun reporting a school profilethat includesextensive information about the school budget, the teachingstaff'sexperience, the community's socio-economic status, and otherinfluentialeducational inputs. (This practice can be dangerous,however, observesCES's Bob McCarthy, because it appears to condone andperpetuate lowerexpectations for disadvantaged schools.)<p>   Vermont's portfolios in writing and mathematics, as wellasConnecticut's performance tasks, are meant chiefly toprovide instantfeedback to their teacher-scorers on what areas requireadditionalclassroom emphasis. How well an individual student does onthese "low-stakes" assessments will not determine the future success orfailure ofthe student or the school, but only what direction his orher classroomwork will take.<p>   Back in the classroom, however, many wonder whether anystandards andassessments generated higher up the line can really helplocal teachersdesign effective instruction. "Any state's framework isimpotent toaffect practice unless it is designed as a continuouslearningopportunity for teachers, not just for kids," says JoeMcDonald, whodirects the Coalition's Exhibitions Project. "The mainpurpose of allassessment systems has to be to generate local energy andinvention inthe interests of all kids' achievement."<p>   On this side of the philosophical fence are TheodoreSizer and otherCoalition leaders, who question both the cost and theeffectiveness ofstandardized testing, which removes the classroom teacherfrom the workof performance assessments.<p>   "Do we <i>need</i> to create a teacherproof assessment system?"asks Croton-Harmon superintendent Sherry King. "For one thing, thesethings arehorrendously expensive to develop. And whenever teachers getpackets ofperformance-based assessments from somewhere else, they'rein danger ofteaching in a formulaic way, just like they did to the old-style tests.You might as well give them workbooks!"<p>   Ted Sizer frames his objection along different lines.Everycommunity, he argues, has its own deep-rooted values thatshow up in itsschool curriculum, reflecting what local people want theirgraduates toknow and be able to do. The tradition of local authorityover schoolingrests on the principle, he says, that those mostaffected-parents,community members, and the like- can influence what theirchildren aretaught and tested on. Except in three areas he callsrelatively free ofthe "value clash" clear writing, resourceful reading, andeverydaymathematical reasoning-he believes the state should steerclear of thetesting and curriculum business. Instead, states couldinsist thatschools maintain good files on every student and couldregularly auditthose files against state standards, providing richer andfairer data atfar less expense than mass testing entails. And they couldoblige everyschool to present its own assessments to public scrutinyevery year,publishing an annual report and holding a public meeting todefend it.<p>   A few states are trying to incorporate such attitudesinto theirefforts to define standards and test student performance.New York's NewCompact for Learning, for instance, favors teacher ownershipof theassessment process-what officials term "top-down support forbottom-upreform." Policies lean toward the most individual ofevaluationprocesses-getting the school community to review its ownstandards byopening itself to the scrutiny of its key stakeholders.Central ParkEast Secondary School, for instance, last year invited acommittee oflocal college and university professors, business people,and others toreview its graduation portfolios and answer whether theschool'sstandards lived up to their expectations. <p>   California's school restructuring movement has devised aprotocolthat asks each school's teachers to scrutinize its studentwork anddiscuss together whether it meets their own standards. "Weask theschool to use what they learn in assessing their ownstudents' work todrive change in their own curriculum and pedagogy," saysMaggie Szabo, aformer Coalition regional coordinator who now heads thestate's schoolrestructuring effort. "It recasts accountability as apositive thing,not a big stick from the outside."<p>   Instead of putting federal and state money intodeveloping new tests,Sizer contends, government should help school people byexposing them tomany examples of rigorous student work that could influencetheir ownthinking-what assessment expert Grant Wiggins has called"standardswithout standardization." One proposed Coalition projectaims to developa national electronic communications network that would linkteacherswith colleagues from other schools, professionalorganizations,employers, higher education professionals, and outsidestakeholders toshare and critique (using a specific "tuning protocol") whatthey areasking students to do. The Exhibitions Collection databasealready underway at CES would be a part of this; so would innovationslike amultimedia "digital portfolio," which keeps track of studentprogresstoward graduation requirements through not only written workbutaudiovisual presentations on line. (A future issue of HORACEwillexplore further the uses of technology for assessment andotherEssential School purposes.)<p>   Reorienting the conversation about rigorous standards sothat itsprimary locus is the school and community, Sizer suggests,gives it achance to influence the real problems schools strugglewith-too littledepth in the curriculum, not enough time for meaningfullearning, scarceresources to help teachers develop their craft. "Thediscussion can'ttake place in a vacuum," he says. "It will be influenced bystaterequirements, by subject-area people, and perhaps more thananything bythe expectations of colleges." But the federal government,he believes,should play the role of persuader, not dictator. The currentmovementruns the risk, one recent commentator noted, of becoming aconversationamong governments-another dictum from on high, complete withnewcurricula, new tests, new red tape, and a whole new set ofhazards.<p>   Unquestionably, Essential schools occupy a key positionright now toaffect the decisions being made at higher levels. Already inthe midstof substantive dialogue about their expectations andexperimentationwith new methods of assessment, when successful they canstand aspowerful examples of a different paradigm of schooling. "Ifthere areplaces where local assessments can work, your chances aremore thandoubled to put them into place system-wide," observes JudyBray, asystems coordinator at the Education Commission for theStates. "Ibelieve that our dedicated network of school folk can changethe systemif they will take a public stand, in support of or dissentto thestandards under development in their own state."<p><hr>   <h2>           New York's New Compact for Learning                  Reflects Essential School Principles</h2><hr>New York was once heavily committed to large-scale testingon twotiers (standardized Regents Competency Tests and morechallengingsubject-area tests that led to a Regents Diploma). But thestate'sNew Compact for Learning, adopted by its Board of Regents in1/91,has galvanized state policymakers into a new push that willultimatelygive responsibility for individual student assessments tolocalities.<p>   The state's major role would be to assess programs, usingsamplingtechniques and state-of-the-art performance assessments totest whetherstudents have achieved the state's learning outcomes in keyareas and atkey points in their development. The state would workclosely withschools to support local development of assessment programsthat fiteach school's goals and curriculum, and to provide access toa bank ofassessment tasks and instruments. And it would evaluate andapproveschool-level assessment so that it aligns with state goalsfor teachingand learning, and so the data obtained is cumulative,coherent, andcomparable.<p>   Certain uses of tests (such as mass-administeredstandardizedplacement tests for young children and tests to separate ortrack"talented" students) would be proscribed. Instead, the statewants localassessments to identify students' talents and shapeinstruction to makethe most of them across the curriculum.<p>   If the new system takes effect, all students will worktoward aunitary Regents Diploma, which provides for three levels ofdistinction.Graduation would follow completion of a "Regents Portfolio"thatexhibits competency across the curriculum as defined in thestate'slearning outcomes. If a school so chose, it could includestate-developed performance assessments to satisfy certainrequirements. TheRegents Competency Tests (RCT) would be replaced by such newassessments, which would allow for different levels, but notdifferentkinds, of performance.<p>   Finally, the state aims to report student performanceaccording tocriterion-referenced information, not norm-referencedpercentilerankings. Rather than averaging their data, it aims toaggregatelongitudinal data about each student over time, so the statecan analyzeactual growth in performance rather than average data from ashiftingstudent population. And it would revise its currentComprehensiveAssessment Report (CAR) to emphasize the school's program,practices,funding, and other resources that affect its students'opportunity tolearn.<p><hr>                  <h2>Another Way of Measuring Up:                  One Schools Graduation Requirements</h2><hr>As students prepare for graduation at Central Park EastSecondary School(CPESS), a high school of 450 students in an East Harlemneighborhood inNew York City, they work intensively to prepare a portfolioof theirwork that will reveal their competence and performance infourteencurricular areas. This portfolio will be evaluated by agraduationcommittee composed of teachers from different subjects andgrade levels,an outside examiner, and a student peer. The committeemembers examineall of the entries and hear the students' oral defense oftheir work todetermine when each student is ready to graduate.<p>   Of the fourteen portfolio items, seven are presentedorally beforethe graduation committee, four from the core subjects(asteriskedbelow). The other seven entries are evaluated independently,and thestudent may be asked about them during the graduationcommittee hearing.While the final review is based on the individual student'saccomplishments, certain portfolio requirements can be metwith groupwork.<p><ol><li><b> Post-graduate plan.</b>Each student outlines his or her purpose for earning adiploma. Thissection includes long- and short-range career and lifegoals, financialconcerns, living arrangements, and indicators of progresssuch asexaminations, interviews, and letters of reference.<p><li><b> Autobiography.</b>This reflective project may examine family history, specialevents orrelationships, values or beliefs in any of a variety ofform.<p><li><b>School/community service and internship.</b>Opportunities for working and serving others are part ofstudentexperiences starting in seventh grade. Students develop aformal resumeof their work experiences along with a project demonstratingwhat theyhave learned from one or more of them; this may includeessays, videos,work samples, reference letters, and the like.<p><li><b>Ethics and social issues.</b>Students demonstrate their capacity to see multipleperspectives, weighand use evidence, and reason about social and moral issuesby staging adebate, writing an editorial, discussing important issuesraised by anovel or film, or another project.<p><li><b>Fine arts and aesthetics.</b>Creative expression and creative appreciation are bothevaluated.Students must create a hands-on exhibition of performance inany of thearts and also show understanding or knowledge of anaesthetic area bystudying or critiquing a work, an artist, or a field ofartisticexpression.<p><li><b>Mass media.</b>Through a project or activity that includes a relevantbibliography,students must demonstrate understanding of how differentforms of mediawork and how they affect people and their thinking.<p><li><b>Practical skills.</b>Students must show evidence of working knowledge in a numberof areas(health and medical care, employment, citizenship,independent living,computers and technology, legal rights) in a variety of ways(securing adriver's license, registering to vote, operating acomputer).<p><li><b>Geography.</b>A teacher-made test and a student-designed performance areused toevaluate geographical knowledge and the ability to usegeographicaltools such as maps and globes.<p><li><b>Second language and/or dual language.</b>Students must demonstrate competence in a language otherthan English asa speaker, listener, reader, and writer. (This can be donevia the NewYork state language proficiency exam or a College Boardexam.) Inaddition, all students must describe their personalexperience with duallanguage issues and be prepared to discuss a key social orculturalissue associated with language use.<p><li><b> Science and technology.*</b>Students must demonstrate knowledge in traditional ways-asummary of thework they have completed in high school and passage of ateacher-made orstate competency test as well as in performances thatdemonstrate use ofscientific methodology (e.g., conducting and documenting anexperiment)and awareness of how science is used in the modern world(e.g., bystaging a debate or conducting research on a scientificdevelopmentanalyzing social costs and benefits).<p><li><b>Mathematics.*</b>Students must demonstrate basic skills knowledge by passinga statecompetency test and a teacher-made test. In addition, theymustdemonstrate higher-order thinking abilities by developing aprojectusing mathematics for political, civic, or consumer purposes(e.g.,social science statistics or polling; architecturalblueprints) andeither scientific or "pure" mathematics (e.g., usingmathematics in ascientific application and/or studying a theoreticalproblem.)<p><li><b>Literature.*</b>Students prepare a list of texts they have read in a widerange ofgenres to serve as the basis for discussion with thegraduationcommittee. They also submit samples of their own essaysabout literaryworks or figures, demonstrating their capacity to reflect onandcommunicate effectively about literary products and ideas.<p><li><b>History.*</b>In addition to passing a state competency test or faculty-designed testin history, students must prepare all overview of the areasof historythey have studied in secondary school and a timeline ofmajorsignificant events and persons. They must also demonstrateunderstandingof historical work by conducting historical research usingprimary andsecondary sources and developing a bibliography. Their workmust drawconnections between and among past and present events, weighand useevidence, speculate on other possibilities, and evaluate howhistory isused or abused in current debates.<p><li><b>Physical challenge.</b>Students demonstrate and/or document their participation andproficiencyin any team or individual sport or activity over the pastfour years.The goal is to encourage the development of lifelong healthhabits andattitudes of independence, interdependence, personalresponsibility, andsportsmanship.<p></ol>A more extensive final senior project is also required in anarea ofparticular interest to the student, which may be one of theportfolioitems explored in greater depth.<p>Portfolio items are evaluated for quality and demonstratedmastery usinga grid that reflects five major criteria: a viewpoint thatencompasseswide knowledge and deep understanding; an ability to drawconnectionsamong information and ideas; appropriate use of evidence; anengagingvoice and awareness of audience; and use of properconventions. Whenstudents have completed the portfolio, they have learned toinquire,critique, analyze, present, and defend their ideas. Theyhave alsolearned to manage long-range tasks that require invention,planning,perseverance, initiative, reflection, and revision. Inshort, they areready for the world outside of school.<p><hr>     <h2>Sizer on National Standards:    'A Wise Division of Labor and Separate Spheres ofInfluence'</h2><hr><i>In </i>Horace's School: Redesigning the American High School<i>(Boston:Houghton Mifflin, 1992) Ted Sizer uses the efforts of thefictitiousHorace Smith and the faculty of Franklin High School as aframework forconsidering various aspects of school reform . The followingis anexcerpt from the book.</i><p>[One] obligation of the state is to solicit, assert, andassess thestandards for students and for schools. This obligationarises at thesimplest level from state constitutions-therequirement for "thorough and efficient" schools-but more isrequired,especially in a world far more complex than it was when the"thoroughandefficient" doctrine was first expressed. In the last decade,most stategovernments have greatly expanded their testing programs-thepreferredmethod of "setting standards"-because they are relativelyinexpensiveandcan be kept neatly away from the hurly-burly of actualschool operation.Most of the examinations programs swirl in politics. Few areproperlyfunded, and they garner paltry academic results and rouseprofounddisrespect from the individuals involved, of all ages.<p>   Not surprisingly, many political leaders are looking forsome meansother than standardized testing as a qualitative yardstickand as aninstrument to encourage students and schools to meet thatstandard. Theyseek tests that are valid in the sense that they "measure"qualities wedesire rather than items that are but tokens of thosequalities. Theseleaders are also concerned that what is measured should bethe realpower of a child, that child's enduring habits, not justwhat he hasprepped for passing a test.<p>   Questions abound. How can a school simplify and deepenits curriculumif the tests continue to reflect the description of thecourse of studyas English-mathematics-science-social studies-language-physicaleducation, each presented in isolation from every other? Howis theschool to press students to show us that they canresourcefully useknowledge, and to display the habit of that use, if thereare on thehorizon few tests of habit and, in many quarters, even nowstill littleinterest in pursuing them?<p>   Most important, who is the state to tell families thesubstance andstandard of everything provided by a school? When so manythoughtfulpeople disagree about the shape and substance of key ideasin several ofthe areas of the high school curriculum, what group canproperly claimthat it speaks for us all, setting a national standard. ..?If schoolsare to be measured by that national standard, what does thissay aboutthe state's respect for community standards? Do not familieshave somerights of control of a public service? To put it mostbluntly, are therenot proper limits to state power over the minds ofadolescents?<p>   Franklin High School's plan suggests a wise division oflabor and aseparation of spheres of influence. The four-part system ofaccountability safeguards the proper interests of the largercommunity-the state-and those of the parent and student. There will besomelimited standardized testing in certain areas. Portfoliosmaintained byand for each student will be accessible to teachers, thestudent'sparents, and representatives of the state, who will conduct"audits" ofthe students' progress and, thus, of the school'seffectiveness.Horace's committee desires assistance from the state'sstaff-friends whoknow the school well enough to describe, criticize, anddefend it on itsown merits. In this respect, it implicitly suggests anAmerican versionof Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools in the UnitedKingdom, at leastin their role as outsiders supportive, critical, and aboveall informedabout a particular school. Franklin will make substantialannual reportsto the community and will discuss them in public session.Added to thislocal accounting is the influence of accreditation byregionalauthorities; their decennial reviews, if thoughtfullyconducted, informa community about its school's merit and challengeindividual schools tosharpen and defend what they believe and how they act uponthosebeliefs.<p>   Also implicit in the report, however, is the convictionthat matterssuch as the literature assignments, the shape of history andsciencecurricula, and the very culture of the school are all ofsuchimportance, delicacy, and sensitivity to reasonable debatethat theymust be left to local discretion. Families must feel welcometo addresstheir concerns directly to the people who have the power tomake orchange decisions affecting their children.<p>   Of course, local discretion will always be and always hasbeenaffected, however obliquely, by a host of influencespressing toward"national standards"-by regional accrediting associations,bycompetitive scholarship programs, by specific requirementsfor admissionto individual colleges, by employers who insist on evidenceof seriouspreparation, by the ebb and flow of scholarship, by choicesmade in thetextbook-publishing industry, by prevalent notions, whethersensible ornonsensical. Serious people at the local level are no moreor less smartabout these matters than people at the state or nationallevel; they areinfluenced by no fewer or greater political pressures thanfound athigher levels of government. Differences across schools maybe not onlythe price of freedom but an excellent vehicle to maintainopennesswithin American education.<p>   The changes will be messy. Democracy is messy. Those whowant anorderly solution toy with democracy, that form of governmentbeset withflaws but better than any of the alternatives. Those whoassert that"the people" can never be trusted with setting standardssing anarrogant, dangerous tune.<p><hr>              <h2> Do-It-Yourself Accountability:               How One School Took Stock of Its Standards</h2><hr>"Half our life is spent on internal accountability-talkingabout whetherthis or that piece of student work is good enough," saysPaul Schwarz,co-principal of Central Park East Secondary School (CPESS)in New YorkCity. "But because we gave up using standardized tests andtheaccumulation of Carnegie units in favor of exhibitions andportfolios asa way to graduate kids from school, we had to worry aboutexternalaccountability, too." The school has solved that problem inthe mostdirect way possible-by opening its doors to well-informedoutsiders, wholook at student work and judge whether it meets their owngraduationstandards.<p>   "Schools and teachers are not used to doing this,"Schwarz says."It's very frightening, to hand over a piece of work andsay, 'Would youhave passed this in your school? How would you grade it?'"<p>   CPESS started by asking nine professors from localcolleges anduniversities to visit the school and review the writingquality of fiveportfolio items in the presence of the staff. "Their ratingsand ourswere very much in sync," Schwarz says. "We've done it now inhistory andmath as well, and we've found the same thing." Moreimportant, thediscussion among visitors and staff afterward always turnedtocurriculum-why certain papers were assigned, how to narrowtopicsusefully, the role of students in choosing work they caredabout.<p>   Next the school decided to look at the entire body of astudent'swork. "Just because a kid was strong in math or writingdidn'tnecessarily mean they were strong in other areas," Schwarzsays."Together the staff and perhaps a couple of outsiders putall fourteengraduation portfolios on the table and asked what it toldus. Were weproud to have graduated this kid? Did we have enoughevidence?" Theprocess was incomplete, Schwarz says, because it lacked akey element ofCPESS's "graduation by exhibition"-seeing the actual studentpresent anddefend the portfolio work before a graduation committee.<p>   Finally, in May 1993 the staff invited some fifteenoutside "criticalfriends" for a day of graduation portfolio review. Schwarzlists themoff: "Three teachers from traditional public schools in NewYork City,three state education department people, some principals ofcomprehensive high schools, some principals and teachersfrom our sisterschools, a couple of foundation people, and a few outsideexperts likeColumbia's Linda Darling-Hammond, Harvard's Dennie Wolf, andBrown's JoeMcDonald."<p>   In a complicated round robin, the visitors inspectedthree or fourcomplete graduation portfolios ("one who barely passed, onein themiddle, one very strong"), interviewed students ofcomparableachievement (two seniors and one recent graduate) abouttheir skills,and watched videotapes of students defending their work.They talked toteachers about academic requirements and to co-principalsSchwarz andDeborah Meier about the structure of the school, and finallytheyoffered their own critique and recommendations.<p>   "The group agreed that our graduation process generatedplenty ofevidence on which to grant diplomas in New York State,"Schwarz says."They raised some important issues about quality: forinstance, shouldwe require one paper to be perfect in form? Different peoplehaddifferent perspectives-the principal of a comprehensive highschool inBrooklyn would react one way, and someone whose daughtergoes a privateschool another way."<p>   The whole event served, this principal says, to satisfythe school'sobligation to share its curriculum and assessment withothers and getcritical feedback. "We want to open the process of standardsetting tothe outside world- to let people look at what kids arereally doing," hesays. "As one of the pioneers in performance assessment,we've embarkedon a serious accountability process."<p>   (The school has produced a 30-minute film on the CPESSgraduationexhibition process; it will be available for viewing at theannual CESFall Forum in November 1993.)<p><hr><h2>What to Look for In Your State's ReformPlan</h2><hr>State education department efforts to draft new standardsand assessmentplans vary widely, influenced by a variety of pressuregroups. To helpsort through the important differences among plans, thefollowingquestions may prove useful.<p><ul><li>Will the state test every student for comparison andselectionpurposes? Or will it sample random students using matrixsamplingmethods for the purpose of assessing school and districtprograms?<li>Will the state use assessment results to reward and punishschools andteachers financially? Or will it use data to identify whereschools needextra help?<li>Has the education department authored statewide curriculumframeworksdescribing what students should know and be able to do? Hasit called onteachers to develop and share those standards? Through whatavenues ofinfluence are teachers explicitly invited to share in thediscussion?<li>Will the state rely on one or two tests with which tomeasure studentperformance? Or will it provide banks of alternativeassessmentpractices and instruments for schools to use?<li>Do state guidelines echo subject-area-based curriculumstandardsdeveloped by professional disciplinary organizations? Or dothey crossdisciplinary lines to describe broader thinking skills andperformanceoutcomes that can be demonstrated in a variety of areas?<li>Does the state dictate the curriculum and assessmentmaterials towhich teachers must shape their classroom practice? Or doesits planinclude time, money, and resources to help teachers renewtheir practiceand generate their own new instruction and assessmentmethods?<li>Is the rating system intended to sort and select studentsagainst ahigh standard of performance, with some failing in theinevitable bellcurve? Or are all students expected to meet the goal, withthe systemtaking responsibility for shaping strategies to get themthere?</ul><p><hr><h2>Clarifying a School's Aims andStandards:                      An Interactive Exercise</h2><hr>California's Center for School Restructuring is workingon an "accountability, learning, and support" system tohelp the state's demonstration schools that have receivedspecial funding for restructuring. The long-range goals ofthe demonstration schools and districts are to "providepowerful learning outcomes for all students" and to invent"an authentic system of accountability." To help schoolsgive an honest accounting of their restructuring work,the Center has devised a "School Change Portfolio" thatwould contain documents, artifacts, student and adultwork, videotapes, and other materials that representchanges in student learning.<p>   The first step in the process, California educationofficials say, is for schools to "translate their vision ofsuccessful students into measurable, holistic outcomeswhich capture what matters most-what knowledge, skills,capacities, habits, and attitudes ought to reside in everystudent as a result of their experience in public schools."These "holistic learning outcomes" then become a tool forguiding the restructuring efforts. As they follow the formalprotocol for together examining their own student works,schools say, it becomes a powerful way to discover whethertheir restructuring innovations are having an impact onstudent learning.<p>   What follows is a 50-minute exercise that takes placeearly in that process, in which school people begin thediscussion of their school's aims and standards for studentperformance. It is included in the materials schools receiveunder the title "Assessment: The Trojan Horse ofRestructuring."<p><h3>Introduction (5 minutes):</h3>Assessment specialist Grant Wiggins refers to assessmentas the Trojan Horse of restructuring. Wiggins believes thatassessment should be the opening gambit and driving forceshaping school and district restructuring efforts.Assessment must bereconceived as not only measuring, but<i>evoking</i> quality student work. This is a major shift in thetraditional role of assessment in education.<p>   Rethinking assessment along these lines means developingclarityabout aims. Clarity does not come from missionstatements, but rather from elaboration of (1) the essentialareas of skill, knowledge, and capacity we want from allour students; and (2) the level of performance we want atthese capacities. Restructuring is simply building theschoolaround the Trojan Horse that is, around <i>essential tasksdone well.</i><p>   The following interactive exercise is a START atbuilding the Trojan Horse namely, building clarityabout the aims of education and the standards for studentperformance.<p><h3>1. Individuals (5 minutes):</h3>List three things you would like all kids to know or be ableto dobefore leaving high school. What are the <i>three most crucial</i>skills orareas of knowledge? Write these three down.<p><h3>2. Small Groups (10 minutes):</h3>Share your three items with members of your group. Discuss,argue, andcome to <i>consensus as a group</i> about three discrete skills,capacities, orareas of knowledge you all feel are crucial for all studentsbefore theyleave high school.<p><h3>3. Large Group (10-15 minutes):</h3>a.  Elicit from the group a list (to be projected overheador written onthe board). Add only new items.<p>b.  Which of these <i>are</i> covered by current standardizedtests, grades, ortraditional methods of assessment? (mark with a check.)<p>c.  Which <i>are not</i> covered by traditional assessment methods?(mark withan arrow.)<p><h3>4. Small Groups (10 minutes):</h3>a.  Select from the main list <i>one</i> item that has an <i>arrow</i> byit.<p>b.  How would you convince students and adults in yourcommunity who areinterested-teachers, parents, board members, businessleaders, and soon-that students do in fact know and are able to do thecrucial item youpicked. What would students need to do to prove they havereached thatcapacity?<p><h3>5. Table Groups (10 minutes):</h3>Join with two other groups (three groups in all) and sharetheassessments you designed.<p><h3>Closing (2 minutes):</h3>The crucial <i>aims</i> aims of schooling-and the <i>performancestandards</i> werequire-must drive the design of school structures.Restructuring meansdesigning curricula, pedagogy, and formative assessmentsthat preparestudents to meet clear and challenging exit-levelrequirements. Further,restructuring requires focusing decisions about deploymentof resources-staff, time, student grouping patterns, budget priorities,decision-making patterns, and so forth on creating the conditionsthat elicitquality student work.<p><hr><h2>What Employers Say Students Should Know and BeAble To Do</h2><hr>The U.S. Department of Labor's Secretary's Commission onAchievingNecessary Skills (SCANS) report, issued in 1991 on the heelsof the BushAdministration's national goals statement, placed studentlearningobjectives within the context of a real environment-thecompetencies andcapacities that "today's high-performance employer seeks intomorrow'semployee."<p>   Teaching and learning the following competencies, thereport argued,must become the tasks of U.S. schools and students. Studentsshouldbecome skilled at managing or using:<p><ol><li><b>Resources.</b>Workers schedule time, budget funds, arrange space, orassign staff.<p><li><b> Interpersonal skills.</b>Competent employees are skilled team members and teachers ofnewworkers; they serve clients directly and persuade co-workerseitherindividually or in groups; they negotiate with others tosolve problemsor reach decisions; they work comfortably with colleaguesfrom diversebackgrounds; and they responsibly challenge existingprocedures andpolicies.<p><li><b> Information.</b>Workers are expected to identify, assimilate, and integrateinformationfrom diverse sources; they prepare, maintain, and interpretquantitativeand qualitative records; they convert information from oneform toanother and are comfortable conveying information orally andin writingas the need arises.<p><li><b>Systems.</b>Effective workers understand their own work in the contextof the workof those around them; they understand how parts of systemsareconnected, anticipate consequences, and monitor and correcttheir ownperformance; they can identify trends and anomalies insystemperformance, integrate multiple displays of data, and linksymbols(e.g., displays on a computer screen) with real phenomena(e.g., machineperformance).<p><li><b>Technology.</b>Technology today is everywhere, demanding high levels ofcompetence inselecting and using appropriate technology, visualizingoperations,using technology to monitor tasks, and maintaining andtroubleshootingcomplex equipment.<p></ol>   In addition, SCANS identified a three-part foundation ofintellectualskills and personal qualities they considered part of eachof the abovefive competencies:<p><ol><li><b>Basic skills.</b>Reading, writing, mathematics (arithmetical computation andmathematicalreasoning), listening, and speaking.<p><li><b> Thinking skills.</b>Creative thinking, making decisions, solving problems,seeing things inthe mind's eye, knowing how to learn, and reasoning.<p><li><b>Personal qualities.</b>Individual responsibility as well as self-esteem,sociability, self-management, and integrity.<p></ol>[For a copy of the SCANS report contact the U.S. Departmentof Labor,Z20 Constitution Ave. NW, Room C-2318,Washington, DC 20210, or call 1-800-788-SKILL.]<p><hr>      <h2>  Horace's Mailbox</h2><hr>To the Editor:<p>   As someone working with the Coalition and with theNational Networkfor Education Renewal (NNER), I was pleased to see yourattention to thecritical issue of teacher education [September] 9931. Iapplaud yourchoice of the University of Southern Maine and theUniversity ofLouisville efforts as exemplars.<p>   While you made important points concerning theprofessionalpreparation of prospective teachers, you missed what may bethe mostimportant point of all. Teachers for Essential schools musthave aninitial education that is more than an apprenticeship totheir craft.Perhaps the most critical element is the general educationthey receive-including their study of the academic disciplines they willbe teaching,which develops them as educated persons. From this they needto developthe broad scope of knowledge that will let them function asgeneralists(as envisioned by the eighth Common Principle) rather thanas thespecialists found most commonly in secondary schools. Theyneed tounderstand the nature of our democratic society, whetherthey areteaching elementary or secondary students. The nine CommonPrincipleswill not guide their work if they do not understand, forexample, whythe school's goals should apply to all students.<p>   You quote Lynne Miller as saying that "Goodlad emphasizesteachereducation as the lever for school renewal," while SouthernMaine sees"school renewal as the lever for teacher education." Moreaccurately,Goodlad and the NNER want to engage Arts and Sciencesfaculty, Collegeof Education people, and school-based faculty simultaneouslyin therenewal of schools and the education of educators. All threeparties areneeded and the action has to go on in both school anduniversitysettings.<p>   Unfortunately, some of the programs that emphasize thefield-basedportion of a teacher's education seem unable or unwilling todemand highstandards for the candidate's general education. They seemto believethat if the person entering their program has a degree withan academicmajor, no matter how old the degree or how weak the program,they can donothing but hope that any academic weakness will be overcomeby theinitiative of the candidate once hired. In order tostrengthen teachereducation, one has to also examine ways that Arts andSciences facultycan be engaged in improving their portion of the totaleffort.<p>Richard W.

McDonald, Bethany Rogers, and Theodore R. Sizer, Coalition of Essential Schools</center></h3><center>October, 1993</center><hr><p><i>The Coalition of Essential Schools gratefully acknowledges the IBM Corporation and the UPS Foundation for their support of its research on Exhibitions.<p> About the Authors:<br>Joseph P. Mcdonald is a Senior Researcher, Bethany Rogers isResearch Assistant to the Chairman and Theodore R. Sizer is Chairmanof the Coalition of Essential Schools<p>A version of this article appeared inthe Stanford Law & Policy Review 4 (Winter 1992Ð93)</i><p><hr><h2>Introduction</h2><hr>Much talk about school reform today is talk about standards. References to standards lurk especially within the questions that policy makers pose: Are American kids learning as much math as their German or Singaporean peers? Do they know as much American history as their parents did? Do they write as well as kids used to? Are teachers professional enough? Is there enough choice in the system? Is the economy well served by our schools? Such questions multiply today with a force that people who work in schools sometimes find offensive. They are accustomed, after all, to an accountability based on norms rather than criteria, and they are understandably confused as to which of the many criteria proposed have the most merit. Not surprisingly, their reaction is often defensive.<p>In what follows, we aim to cut below the surface of rhetorical offense and defense, and in a less contentious space reflect on what standards really are, on what legitimates them, and on how policy makers and practitioners may employ them in a partnership aimed at deepening the education of all children. Our method is to pose and pursue two basic questions about standards. The first offers a hunt for the word's deeper meanings. In asking it, we use the writer Raymond Carver's cadence: What do we talk about when we talk about standards? Carver posed the same question about love, a word whose usage in American conversation similarly conceals as much as it reveals.1 <p>We're particularly interested in how use of the word standards may relate willy-nilly to two old habits of American thinking about public policy. On the one hand, we are moved as a people by the dream of a better system--one that works more efficiently, more comprehensively. On the other hand, we are tempted to wish for no system at all--to surrender the system's function to "natural" forces. The particularly American version of this debate is familiar, going back two-hundred-plus years to the one waged by Hamilton and Jefferson. By uncovering these opposing tendencies in our talk and thinking, we hope to free ourselves from slavishness to either one. <p>Our second question grows directly out of the first, emphasizing its political aspects: Who shall set the standards, and by what right? In pursuing this question, we mean to challenge complacency about how power is distributed now in American education, and to challenge as well ideas about how it might be distributed in the future. In the process, we will lay out several options for accountability policy that we believe honor the interests of the many and varied stakeholders of American schooling. <p>Our advocacy of these options grows not only from our analysis, but also from our experience and our colleagues' experience in the Coalition of Essential Schools. We know the options to be rooted in the possible. <hr><h2>What Do We Talk About When We Talk About Standards?</h2><hr>A standard answers the question, What is good enough here?  Whether here is the performance of a laundry detergent or of a school. The standard serves to hold us accountable, by offering a vision "implicit or explicit" against which the performance in question can be measured. <p>Standards always involve criteria, though some criteria are less thoughtful than one might wish. What's considered "good enough" in a laundry detergent, for example, may depend on whiteness above all other factors, including cleanliness and environmental impact. Similarly, what's now considered good enough in a school may depend on the school's average performance on achievement tests, tests which are often constructed with little thought of what is most important for kids to achieve and which reveal little about those qualities we value most in our kids. Or it may depend on the school's provision of "opportunities" that are really no such thing: the chance to select one of several levels of math courses, for example, from the packed course catalogue of a "shopping-mall high school."2<p>One way to characterize the increasing clamor about educational standards today is to ascribe it in part to a shared discontent with the usual criteria. Our concern, we say, is with ratcheting up standards in order to improve the educational outcomes of all kids. How shall this be done? For several reasons, including especially the growth of a political rhetoric that links national economic prospects to mass intellectual development, we are collectively moving toward a process in the United States which grounds school standards in values rather than national norms.3 The thinking is that standards rooted in values "as opposed to those based on norms," will forecast more accurately for all kids what constitutes "good enough." They will be "fixed" in a way that transcends the vacillation of shifting averages. Yet the policies proposed to facilitate these higher, values-based standards often entail unexamined contradictions. We are worried that they may have deeply undemocratic consequences.4<p>From our view, these policies reflect one or both of two basic strategies. The first aims to improve the system massively by unifying  it around a "high-powered" set of--you guessed it--standards. The other seeks to scrap the "system" altogether in favor of a market approach to standard setting. In a gross simplification of terms, we dub the first a neoliberal strategy and the other a neoconservative one. <p><hr><h2>The Neoliberal Strategy</h2><hr>The neoliberal strategy typically begins with a systematic inquiry into what all American kids should know and be able to do as a result of their schooling, then proceeds to the design of a comprehensive assessment system geared to those outcomes. In both respects, the strategy focuses on standards as relatively fixed and tangible things-finding them, setting them, enforcing them, using them to drive teaching and learning. A good example of the complete strategy is the work of the SCANS Commission, which has defined a rich set of workplace skills for the twenty-first century and has also proposed means to assess them.5 Other examples include the many efforts under way in the states and at the national levels to define curriculum frameworks, so-called "content standards"--one thinks of the standards in mathematics from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and in science from Project 20616--and the efforts under way also in the states and at the national level to define "performance standards" relative to this content.<p>The partisans of this strategy tend to have a sophisticated grasp of the nature of knowledge, the current state of the disciplines, the qualities of context that good teaching and learning demand, and the failures of policy and practice that their strategy would supplant. For these reasons, their arguments are appealing within policy circles--and for one other reason, too: what they seek is an improved system rather than a new one, and that is always an easier message to swallow. As they like to point out, we already have a national curriculum and a national assessment system in the United States--bad ones, in our view, controlled almost completely by the textbook- and test-publishing industries. <p>In approach and appeal, the partisans of this strategy seem the twenty-first-century counterparts of the administrative progressives who transformed American schooling at the start of this century.7 Like their forebears, they too seem obsessed by the irrationality of the current system: its unreliable processes, its domination by parochial interests, its unresponsiveness to current economic demands, and the uneven quality of its products. For the neoliberals, standards inhere especially in a vision of expanding economic productivity. What knowledge, they ask, does such productivity require? Their method proceeds then to revise the goals of school accordingly, and to hold the schools accountable to those new goals with assessments skillfully devised to measure what matters. What remains problematic for the neoliberals is not the finding and setting of standards but the design of an efficient system capable of being driven by them.<p><hr><h2>The Neoconservative Strategy</h2><hr>Similarly, partisans of the strategy we call neoconservative anticipate no serious problems finding and setting standards, though for quite a different reason. Whereas the neoliberals proceed under the Platonic assumption that good analysis alone is sufficient to discover the "truth" about what all American children should know and be able to do, the neoconservatives put their trust in a later philosopher, Adam Smith. So their strategy seeks standards from another source. John Chubb and Terry Moe explain:<p>"Within a choice system, the main form of accountability is bottom-up, a concept foreign to bureaucrats and politicians. School quality is in the hands of teachers, school heads, and governing boards, who make their own decisions about everything that matters. Parents and students, free to choose, then pass judgment on how well the schools are doing in providing the types and quality of services they want. They support schools that please them. They abandon schools that don't. This is how schools are held accountable--by the power and decisions of the people they serve.8"<p>What is problematic for the neoconservatives is not system design, of course, since they want as little <i>system</i>--meaning as few overarching control mechanisms--as possible. But they worry greatly about how to achieve the near laissez-faire they believe a humming market needs.9 They particularly fear the dangers of partial success: that choice plans will offer only limited choice, that the system will still be in charge, that there will be no real opportunity on the supply side, that  special interests will manage to intervene after all. Moreover, Chubb and Moe in particular rail against the "disabling constraint" of democratic school governance, which, they say, breeds bureaucracy and instability.10 The problem, in their analysis, is that democratic governance seeks to impose "higher-order values" the "demands of remote constituents" on schools, but can manage to enforce these values only through regulation.11 At issue is their dispute with the imposition of secondary influences "the checks and balances embodied in elected school boards and legislators" on "pure" market operation. One reads in their complaint an entrenched attitude toward the dilemma that Amy Gutmann suggests lies at the heart of democracy: whether to give priority to civic virtue or to individual freedom.12 In absolute terms, the neoconservatives choose individual freedom, whereas the neoliberals opt for civic virtue.<p><hr><h2>Struggling for Common Ground</h2><hr>It is the complacency in their respective polarity that most disturbs us about the partisans of both strategies. Finding and setting standards for American schools and American schoolchildren's performance is a highly problematic undertaking, inescapably so. Plato can't deliver the kind of standards needed, nor can Adam Smith. This is because the values that must ground these standards are as diverse as the country, but they are also its unifying characteristics. These values are frequently ambiguous (as, for example, in the very case of whether we prefer individual freedom or civic virtue), changeable, and profoundly dependent on context. At the same time, they are also widely distributed, deeply held, and shared. They may indeed inhere in certain visions of the ideal twenty-first-century workplace or in the best practices of the disciplines; indeed, a pursuit of them there is a worthy undertaking. This does not mean, however, that they can be readily abstracted from these settings-the result of a two-year project, say, undertaken by scholars, teachers, and a federal agency or a foundation. Even the disciplines, though they are indeed disciplined, are nonetheless in continual evolution and subvert intentions to codify them: when treated as other than the organic forms which they are, these areas of knowledge are cheated of their substance and aesthetic. <p>Meanwhile, although the market provides a valuable mechanism for encouraging higher standards, we cannot trust that they will arise spontaneously from the mere availability of choices. Who in adchoked America could believe such a thing? That is, who would say that one can make a good decision even about such a relatively trivial thing as what vacuum cleaner to buy absent some source of independent guidance -a consumer rating, a friend's experience, something other than a mere array of choices? And who would say--in the face of the fact that shopping malls are maldistributed--that everybody enjoys an equal opportunity to choose well among vacuum cleaners? Of course, some neoconservatives would argue that any choice, freely made, is a good one--whether what is involved is a vacuum cleaner or a child's education. We think too much is at stake in the latter case to warrant such a bald assertion.<p>While we remain cautious about both the neoliberal and the neoconservative strategies, we also appreciate certain features of both. We believe, moreover, that it is possible to construct policies which preserve the best of both while protecting against the worst of both. Indeed, this may be the best practical course. Michael Fullan argues that when it comes to educational change, top-down doesn't work and bottom-up doesn't work; the only hope is to get them together.13 We are persuaded that a good rule of thumb in this regard is to maintain the tension that was posed by Gutmann's democratic dilemma, which is to say, avoid settling it definitively one way or the other.  <p><hr><h3>What Are "Good" Standards?</h3><hr>To know where and how to seek standards, we think one must acknowledge that good standards are not things which are clear, discrete, and fit for checklists. Much in the fashion of Aristotle, who claimed that essence is necessarily intertwined with existence, we believe that standards cannot exist apart from experience. To answer the question, "What is good enough here?" one must refer to images of good enough--the way people look, talk, act, or feel while being good enough in whatever performance they attempt. And in the process, one should not stray too far from where here is. It may be useful to abstract qualities: one can surely draw upon images of actual performance in diverse settings to create what are called rubrics used for rating the likes of "coherence" or "inventiveness" on a scale of one to five--but disembodied criteria lack vitality, and such rubrics are short-lived. Anyone who has ever used them to judge actual human performance knows that they only come to life in the face of this performance, then fade in clarity and power as images from the performance fade.<p>In our view, the standards we use in assessing schools and kids in school require a method of collecting and preserving images of excellence. This system, of gathering and disseminating, should allow for a basis of connection among all a school's stakeholders and should generate benchmarks of comparison among all schools. In this respect, we honor the neoliberal view, which recognizes that American democracy cannot tolerate the radical liberties of an utterly open marketplace in schooling, one which promotes individual freedom at the expense of civic virtue.<p>Yet good standards must also possess room for dispute. By this, we mean the kinds of differences which are not easily or immediately resolvable. Our view here is derivative of an ethic, as Gutmann says, that makes a virtue of disagreement. This means we need to find standards, hold them, and apply them in such a way that they remain tentative, lively, and open to all manner of possibility. In this respect, we honor the neoconservative view of standards, which cringes at the extreme authority of a set of detached and impervious standards which are delivered from "on high" by small, representative committees of whatever good will. <hr><h3>How Can We Respect our Differences?</h3><hr>What we seek is a common ground between these views in what Maxine Greene calls an "authentic public space":The aim is to find (or create) an authentic public space . . . one in which diverse human beings can appear before one another as, to quote Hannah Arendt, "the best they know how to be." Such a space requires the provision of opportunities for the articulation of multiple perspectives in multiple idioms, out of which something common can be brought into being. It requires, as well, a consciousness of the normative as well as the possible: of what ought to be, from a moral and ethical point of view, and what is in the making, what might be in an always open world.14<p>The standards of the sort we seek may at once depend upon and sustain such a space. Such "optimum standards," linked together by a variety of mechanisms loosely coupled, will appeal to and provide for imaginative and intuitive capacities as well as rational ones. They will not deal merely with the knowledge that inheres in the world as it is, but will also push past such boundaries. As such, optimum standards allow room for uncertainty, for what may not now be known. They offer us means for inventing the future rather than confining it by measurements from the past, and help us to "look at things," as Greene puts it, "as if they could be otherwise."15 <p>These are the standards that we think we all ought to be talking about in American education today, since we can use them to teach as well as to hold ourselves accountable. Meanwhile, we also must carefully attend to the distribution of power (Who decides?), and we must devise various accountability mechanisms, intended to fulfill different purposes and measure from different angles.<p><hr><h2><center>Who Shall Set the Standards, and by What Right?</center></h2><hr>Take a seventh grade classroom: two teams of kids serve as the sides in a debate--effectively a "trial" before the United States Supreme Court, the 1944 Korematsu case. They have filed "briefs," and the sequential drafts of these "briefs," including each student's individual contributions over the month prior to the debate, have been made available to the "jury." One side challenges the Roosevelt Executive Order requiring internship of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War; the other defends it. The "jury" includes the teacher, the principal of the middle school, a teacher from a neighboring school, and two parents. Six fifth-graders watch, seeing (inevitably goggle-eyed) what lies ahead of them in their studies. The debate see-saws, with each side ratcheting up the argument, marshaling new facts, probing the other's inconsistencies. At the end, jury members ask some questions, which push the students' grasp of the issues. All of the members here are participants, and the learning is powerfully served by the process of probing feedback. Meanwhile, though the setting of the trial itself is an individual teacher's classroom, its context is much wider: the whole school knows about it; the standards that inhere in these fifth-graders' performances infect the discourse of the school in a most beneficial way.16<p>Take a senior presentation on AIDS, again before a panel of adults, including an assistant superintendent, community members (including a physician), and younger students. All the students of this high school must make such a presentationm --the culmination of a year-long interdisciplinary inquiry. This particular eighteen year old moves from a presentation on the human immune system and on how the HIV virus appears to affect it to the physiological effects of that condition on patients. Spanning the disciplines of philosophy, ethics, statistics, sociology, and biology, she addresses the global incidence of the disease, with explanations both geographic and cultural, and posits rates of its spread. She speaks of the nature of care, of remedies and palliatives, of costs, both financial and psychological. Earlier, she turned in an essay on these matters to her panel, and its members now ask questions. What assumptions did you make about the global spread of the disease? Why and how did you compute its scale? On what basis might a community allocate the scarce resources for treatment and care? And more.<hr><h2>Exhibitions and Standards</h2><hr>These are both "public" exhibitions of mastery. They require broad and deep knowledge, and they require the demonstrable use of the knowledge. They allow for dialogue, for the follow-up question, for the clarification of language (especially for the student for whom English is not the home language). They also allow possibilities for an examinee to regroup and try again and to draw on various media to convey understanding. The topics are "real," of demonstrable importance even to the middle school student; even the historical example above clearly represents a consequential current issue. Students know what is expected of them, which is itself as much of an incentive as the bracing excitement of "public" presentation.17 Through the practice of exhibitions, we are able to glimpse the motion of an evolving standard, to witness learning and achievement--right before our eyes. The performance also affords us a glimpse at a rich cross section of a student's acquired skills and abilities as in one of the cases above, from the student's use of various modes of expression to her ability to bring philosophy and statistics to bear on biology. Accordingly, as an assessment of that child's work, the exhibition has greater validity than a conventional test, and it is at once fairer and more useful. It is also more educational in its own right. The exhibition efficiently and happily blurs the line between assessment and instruction: the understanding we see is visible in the interchange of performance and feedback.<p>For the neoliberal, such exhibitions represent worthwhile goals. To apply the SCANS criteria, these exercises demonstrate that "information is acquired, evaluated, organized, interpreted, and communicated by students to appropriate audiences, . . . disciplines needed for problem solving are integrated; thinking involves problem solving, reasoning, and decision making."18 Exhibitions at their best are authentic in that they are fully lifelike representations of real and complex intellectual problems; they take their sense from the rational systems of thought we exercise in the real world. But, exhibitions grow out of the systematic, careful operation of "planning backwards." Much as in the eminently logical system of the neoliberal, an exhibition begins with the determination of what kids should know and be able to do and proceeds methodically "backwards" to define what and how kids must be taught to reach those outcomes.19 The aims, made clear in advance, drive and shape the teaching. <p>However, in our conception of exhibition, the scale differs. Exhibitions are local "displays," open to and reflective of their constituencies rather than of professionals in remote and protected bureaucracies. The criteria attend less to the unified thinking of "best" analysis, and more to the freedom of civic and cultural diversity, as in the neoconservative strategy. Thus, one can imagine their service within a radical "choice" scheme: those parents who do not like the substance or standards of the exhibitions they see can withdraw their children to search out a truer articulation of their values. By the same token, one can also imagine their service within a system where the state still plays an active role in fostering and maintaining high standards: they become a rich means by which the state may inspect or audit the schools' efforts and results.<p>Such exhibitions, for an individual or for individuals in groups; written, displayed, oral, or in some combination; within courses or apart from them, provide the "public spaces" that Maxine Greene would have us create for the display and for the neverending evolution of standards.20 As such, they provide a basis for standard setting--one legitimated by their rootedness in learning and in actual school communities.<p><hr><h2>Building an Accountability System</h2><hr>If all schools must exhibit their own work in the public performances of their students, then some schools will exhibit work of exceptional quality. The next step in building a workable and legitimate accountability system, therefore, will involve creating public awareness of such quality and providing incentives to take heed of it. The objective is to pressure weaker schools to expect-and to teach toward similar standards. This presumes broad access to the best of exhibitions, and it also presumes some system of commentary whereby teachers and scholars independent of any particular school may help shape awareness. Finally, it presumes a system of state governance and support of education that preserves equity while encouraging diversity of approaches to accountability, supports pioneer schools, honors the dialogue of the local "public space," and is committed to enhancing (but not overwhelming) this dialogue with perspectives from elsewhere.<p>Modern computer and televideo technology and the expanding "information highways" represented, for example, by Internet/NREN can help the state fulfill the last of these functions. In the foreseeable future, they will provide the means to display and distribute complex images of excellence in student performance and to engage in a large-scale and far-flung conversation about them.21 States might not only provide the network and other supports for such a conversation, but might also insist that schools take part. <p>Today, almost all states insist that schools report on their students' performance in test scores that drain the life from that performance. What we propose is that they insist instead on reports enlivened with student performance, and then insist also that schools help each other grow in their capacity to hold students to high standards. They can do so by simply engaging in a facilitated conversation that alternates "warm" and "cool" perspectives,22 in which the schools balance appreciative and supportive commentary on their peers' work, with discerning and constructively critical commentary. This conversation can have a very powerful impact on schools, particularly within states that preserve each school's authority and responsibility to take action in response to what they learn about themselves in these encounters. These will be states that have learned to go beyond checklist standards and bureaucratic accountability. Standards that grow out of shared local exhibitions might promote an unending national conversation about what really matters in education, one grounded in actual images of actual performance in real and local settings. This would represent an enormous improvement over the current conversation where liveliness withers in the abstract discourse of goals and outcomes. <p><hr><h2>Who Sets the Standards Here?</h2><hr>Who sets the standards here, and by what right?  First of all, the individual school takes the initiative, by the right of being closest to the students who are to be held to the standards. Of course, much of the current palaver over standards and accountability arises from the belief of many among the public and within the educational policy community that schools are currently incapable of positing and maintaining academic standards of a quality required by the emerging global economy and culture. So, the argument goes, others must take over this work. <p>But the argument overlooks the fact that the entire enterprise is ultimately dependent on developing this capability among teachers--since one cannot teach to a standard one is incapable of imagining.23 The argument also begs the question, Who is capable of setting and maintaining standards, if school people are not? The states acting alone? The federal government? Some national and quasi-public agency? The Educational Testing Service? Who will argue that any large bureaucracy--with any manner of support--is likely to be more responsive to economic signals and shifts in cultural values than are small groups of professional educators who enjoy the simple support of having some time to read and discuss what outsiders write?<p>State bureaucracies are freer from the parochial concerns of particular communities, but this insulation is as much a political peril for school reform as it is a boon. In this regard, consider the interests and rights of a second constituency, namely, parents. In what we propose, schools initiate standard-setting in the presence of parents, who may wish to dispute their choices. States or other faraway entities might well persuade parents that they ought to set standards for computational mathematics or reading or the production of expository prose, but can they persuade parents that their views should out-weigh the parents' views in more ambiguous matters: which books to read, what historical interpretation should hold sway, what constitutes appropriate behavior in sexual and moral matters, etc.? The educational press often carries stories about one state or another's failure to do so. In some questions of standards, most American parents seem to want to retain the power to question the standard-setters directly. Reforms that diminish their power in this respect are likely to run into much political trouble in the long run--but trouble of a kind consistent with democracy.<p>But others, too, besides teachers and parents, have rights in this matter of standard-setting, and they exercise them in the model we propose. So the larger professional community--researchers, the unions, the curriculum associations, etc.--has the chance, for once, to function as a professional community and in a conversation anchored by rich images of teaching and learning. Because that conversation is electronic as well as face-to-face, other stakeholders can exercise their right to take part, too. Meanwhile the state--with richer access to the actual performance of schools than ever before--can better exercise its right and constitutional responsibility to ensure equity and quality. Moreover, the rights of each group -including the students themselves, their particular teachers, the scholarly community, the immediate community of employers and cultural partisans, and the state -may be exercised directly, not (as is often now the case) through token representation on committees. <p>The "public space" in which this dialogue occurs will, of course, be full of tension, as these constituencies play out their rights; such tension is both the fuel and the protection of democracy.24 Implied here is the extension to education of habits common in the political and cultural spheres. There, the question of a good or bad policy, as of good or bad art, is never clearcut and is expected to provoke contention. Moreover, Americans have historically considered contention in these realms to be beneficial rather than deleterious, even necessary, to approximating the inherent "truth" of such questions. <p><hr><h2>Policy Options for Accountability</h2><hr>Inevitably, the schools affect us all, so we need an accountability system that reflects that fact, one that allows many voices. Achieving this in practice will take generous invention and experimentation and is likely to spawn much local and regional variation. We leave room for this invention, experimentation, and variation in the framework which follows. <p>The framework is made up of practices that honor the individual school as the proper locus of accountability; it acknowledges, however, that the school cannot manage this responsibility if it continues to be isolated in its setting of standards. It is a framework of policy options insofar as the practices it suggests require in some instances the support of policy and in all instances the forbearance of policy. It grows directly out of our belief that the current ferment around standards -complete with economic, political, and cultural incentives-provides a unique opportunity for profound open-mindedness about educational policy and for the invention of radically new constellations of shared authority.<p><hr><h2>An Accountability Framework</h2><hr>We propose the following six features for a framework that respects the interdependence of policy and practice. We believe this mix of "accountability measures" addresses the claims of a student's and her school's various constituencies, and it does so at a financial cost that the public is likely to be willing to pay.<p><ol><li><b>Exhibitions as a central feature of the school's assessment system. </b>By exhibitions we mean performance assessments that introduce authentic contexts into teaching and learning, that dare to show the school's stakeholders what the school's students have achieved, that help the school take stock of whether its systems are working to ensure high achievement for all students, and that push learning deeper even while they assess it. <p><li><b>Continued provision of basic general testing as a supplement to the Exhibitions.</b>25 This should involve the best standardized tests available in computational mathematics, reading, and expository prose--whether developed by commercial publishers or the states. Our caution here is that such tests must be kept supplementary to Exhibitions. The point is to maintain a trendline of achievement in basic empowering skills, and so preserve political confidence while experimenting with richer accountability mechanisms.<p><li><b>Maintenance of portfolios of each student's work, including that student's Exhibitions.</b> These files, kept by the school, perhaps in an electronic format, will be open to the student, his teachers, his parents or guardian, and to designated representatives of the district and state. The student's progress is thereby visible to those who care most about him, and who may ascertain his achievements in relation to others' by using "benchmark" measures (see #5 below) or by examining the student's work against the collection of images of excellence provided within a tele-communications network.  <p><li><b>Development of an accountability capacity within the school. </b>By this we mean the dedication of time, space and institutional priority to building and designing standards, collaborating on assessment across classrooms, communicating with stakeholders, and ensuring that individual students do not fall through the cracks in the system. As Linda Darling-Hammond suggests, this last objective especially will involve the invention of mechanisms of "continual collegial inquiry in which hard questions are posed."26 <p><li><b>State "audit" of individual student files or portfolios. </b>This audit might take the form of, say, an examination of the work of every fifty-ninth student against a general standard agreed upon by the state and by the school. This standard might be annually "set" by the school community and the state "auditor" on the basis of discussions (facilitated by the national telecommunications network) of highstandard work exhibited by students of roughly similar age across the country and informed by the periodic reports of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The auditor would report on the school (but not on the individual students whose files were pulled) to that school itself and to the state, establishing benchmarks of achievement -based on the aggregate of student files--without imposing highstakes consequences for individuals. Consequences to schools, on the other hand, will come from pressure the community brings to bear, a result of increased public and professional awareness regarding the schools' operations. <p><li><b>Publication of an annual school report. </b>This report would include a statement from the state auditor, and it would be necessitate a public meeting to discuss the findings. The public library would maintain a set of these reports and also provide access to examples of high standard student work drawn nationally, and to the reports of NAEP.</ol><p>Schools are ultimately about helping young people to use their minds well and to develop a thoughtfulness about all aspects of their lives. Schools don't primarily yield a "product," save at the margins (a person who can calculate percentages, for example). They are about preparing individuals to cope with an inevitably uncharted future. Coping with this unknown future in an informed and principled way is in fact a crucial standard. Therefore, schools need to prepare graduates who can engage in this art of informed mental activity. And schools' assessments must focus on these complex ends, no matter how difficult they are to test.<p>Unlike virtually any other American activity, elementary and secondary schooling is compulsory. Citizens are forced to attend. Accordingly, the definition of the routines of school and, particularly, the shape of its substance and standards have to be approached with patience and addressed with careful restraint. Complacent, politically rigid, or ideologically codified positions are anathema to any mindful consideration of standards. Setting standards is not a science. It mimics the process of creating art. <p><hr><h2>Notes</h2><hr><ol><li>Raymond Carver, What We Talk about When We Talk about Love (New York: Knopf, 1981).<li> See Arthur Powell, Eleanor Farrar, and David Cohen, The Shopping Mall High School (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1985).<li>There is nothing new about this impetus to associate economic success with the performance of schools.

In the Essential Schools movement, this takes theform of a commitment to personalized learning-the teacher as coach to no morethan eighty students, rather than as deliverer of instructional services to alarger, continually changing group. In order to achieve this more intimatestudent-teacher ratio, the Coalition of Essential Schools believes, teachersmust assume multiple obligations, viewing themselves as generalists first asthey help students learn to use their minds well. This often means thatcurricula and schedules in the Essential School reflect an interdisciplinaryphilosophy, with teachers designing and leading classes in fields outside theirspecialization.<P>   At least as important, Essential Schools aim towards an integrated curriculumfrom a conviction that students deserve a unified approach to their studies.With the possible exception of the librarian, students are the only ones in highschool who are expected to be generalists-math teachers need only do math;history teachers only history, and so forth. It is a faculty's intellectualresponsibility, the Coalition of Essential Schools holds, to mend the fracturedschool day into a sustained interdisciplinary inquiry that provides studentswith the scholarly model they need.<P>   But how does such a commitment work in practice? Most teachers come to theirprofession trained in only one field, and have little incentive or opportunityto expand their education later. As well, the very notion of "teacherempowerment" now fashionable implies a kind of autonomy within the classroom, asupport for individual professional judgment that could be shaken by aninterdisciplinary model. Teachers who are asked to transform themselves intogeneralists in the Essential School then, face a variety of troubling questions.Will team planning or team teaching result in a loss of control over their ownclasses and curricula? Will they embarrass themselves in front of theircolleagues through a lack of knowledge in another field, or will preparationsfor interdisciplinary courses take an impossible amount of extra time? Can theyeffectively lead discussions in fields outside their own?<P>   How such change is introduced and developed is a central issue with whichEssential Schools continue to wrestle. Some 400 teachers and principals who arein the midst of the process met recently at CES's Fall Forum, and theirconversations-electric to a degree unusual at any educational conference, andnecessarily limited in their representation here-described in fascinating detailthe ways schools have found to build consensus and cooperation as an EssentialSchool program takes hold.<P><hr><h2>Is Teaming Essential?</h2><hr>Some unusual teachers have always stood out within their schools for acomprehensive approach to their disciplines-history teachers who require, forexample, that students analyze the literature and art of the period. In thatsense, there is nothing "essential" about team teaching or even team planning;the nine common principles of Essential Schools ask only that teachers beregarded as generalists. But for most teachers beginning such an approach, theonly practical way to learn to be a generalist is to join other teachers incurriculum planning or team teaching.<p>   At Central Park East Secondary School, a New York City public high schoolstarted as a Coalition school four years ago, a broadly interdisciplinarycurriculum with a stripped-down character is designed by teams of five teachers.Teachers then work largely on their own, in individual classrooms, with smallgroups of students over two-hour class periods. Principal Deborah Meier seesthis system as a way of giving teachers a great deal of autonomy while at oncekeeping them accountable for what they do. "A teacher must answer to the wholeteam for what he's doing," she says, "so there's little chance of someone doingoutlandish things." At the same time, Meier says, "the discrepancy between thebest and the worst teachers in the school is not so great as it may beelsewhere."<p>   Team planning also works at Central Park East as a method of coaching newteachers, who can share ideas and experiences with stronger or more experiencedteachers. And it can be used to train teachers unfamiliar with Essential Schoolsprinciples. This year, for example, a new teacher hired suddenly to fill anunexpected opening is co-teaching one of her two courses with Mike Goldman, wholeads CPE's humanities team.<p>   Teachers at CPE belong either to the humanities or the math and sciencesteam; they meet daily and weekly to plan their courses on several levels. In theparticular area they choose to explore over a year-"Strands in American History"is an example-they devise "essential questions" ("What is the nature ofpower?"); and then work together to come up with answers themselves. After aninitial overview of the subject matter, students spend their time seeking outanswers to the essential questions through a combination of readings, smallgroup discussions, and written research projects.<p><hr><h2>Student-As-Worker Is Key</h2><hr>The system depends, Meier and Goldman both point out, on the metaphor of"student-as-worker," another of CES's nine common principles. And that relatesdirectly to how teachers in this and many Essential School programs manage tobecome generalists in the classroom, by developing the idea of each student asan individual expert, a resource to the group as a whole. Students and teachersthen work out ways to find out what they need to know-so in coming to understanda subject from various perspectives himself, a teacher serves as an active andpowerful scholarly model.<p>   Goldman sees this process of discovery as the heart of his approach, andworks hard to show students how to do it. At the start of the term he and otherteachers model a student-led discussion in front of the class; students thenanalyze and criticize how it is done, make up rules, and try it themselves.Focusing on content and evidence, students ask questions and research theanswers, then summarize and report on their findings.<P>   "At first you feel that you're losing control," says Goldman. "But when yougive over this kind of power to students, you still can step in when necessary.It's a technique you need to learn." His co-teacher Dina Hirsch, who came to CPEfrom a New York high school for gifted students, agrees. "I used to give averdict at the end of a student-led discussion," she says. "'You did a greatjob!' I'd say. Now I ask instead for student feedback on how each other did. Ittakes away the role of teacher as judge."<p>   Craig Simpson, a social studies teacher who coordinates the Odyssey programat Andover High School in Andover, Massachusetts, also speaks of shifting theteacher's role to the role of arbitrator, not lecturer, with the focus onstudent group work. "Seven years after I began this, the information I used togive in a 45-minute lecture takes ten minutes," he says.<p>   Unlike CPE, though, the Odyssey program puts strong emphasis on teamteaching. "I mean TEAM, not TURN teaching," Simpson says, "with the teachers inthe room together and actively participating at all times, although one teachermay have the main responsibility for overseeing a discussion." Even though theratios may be the same, Simpson would rather have two teachers in a class of 60students than one teacher with 30. Alone in a classroom, a teacher can nevercreate the additional inspiration and support another teacher provides, he says.<p>   Classes are planned daily at Odyssey-"horrendously rigorously," Simpson says-in a 45-minute planning period. "It takes that long to keep ourselves in unisonand flowing," he says. Initial worries about the extra work of planning weremade up for, says one English teacher who works with Simpson, by the supportteachers give each other. "I have people around me who aren't going to let mefail," she says.<p><hr><h2>To Fail Is to Succeed</h2><hr>"I feel we have to learn how to give people the RIGHT to fail," Simpson says inquick response. The question of failure, which arises from both teachers andstudents thinking in terms of performance, is an interesting side issue in manyof these redirected classrooms. Teachers often express concern, for example,that their lack of expertise in a field will cause them embarrassment orundermine their authority. But Kathy Cook, who teaches art on Andover's Odysseyteam, says that her early performance anxiety soon gave way to a feeling thatteam teaching was "fun, supportive, and enabling." In her view, "the key is thatstudents see the teachers interacting with each other" in a highly structuredbut open atmosphere. This models a kind of inquiry for the students, where goalsare shared.<p>   In addition, Andover principal Wilbur Hixson points out, Odyssey allowsstudents to perceive "wrong" answers as paths to thinking through problems. "Toomany of us for too long didn't see the value of an incorrect answer," he says."It tells us something important about how the student is thinking and about howwe are teaching." His point may be a critical factor in why Essential Schoolsprograms so often energize and motivate students at lower academic levels. Atraditionalist who once served as vice-principal in charge of studentdiscipline, Hixson gives high marks to the Odyssey program in this area.<p>   The sense a teacher develops of himself as a learner, not a master, alsomitigates initial fears of failure. "I had to learn how to become a studentagain myself," says Fran Flynt, one of four team teachers in a small EssentialSchool program within Springdale High School in Springdale, Arkansas. "You haveto drag out and dust off those traits and attitudes that you once had." Shespeaks as well of the "parity of insecurity" that develops among a team wheneveryone involved is on new ground. "I may have to read history," she says ofher team's joint efforts, "but the history teacher also has to read Melville."As with many teachers who take such risks, Flynt has found herself continuallyrewarded by her forays into unfamiliar material. "I find I am able to draw someconclusions, help to direct discussion, and make assignments," she says. "Icouldn't go back to teaching in a traditional classroom. But that change in myattitude came with a lot of struggle."<p>   At the Brimmer & May School, a small private school in Chestnut Hill,Massachusetts, the team approach is distilled in a carefully orchestrated planworked out by faculty over the summer before. Together they decide on anintellectual theme-this year it is "Searching for Solutions"-to become the majororganizing principle for the year. Each week a different aspect of this theme-the role of evidence, say, or of hypothesis-is emphasized in various fieldsduring regular class hours; and every Wednesday faculty and students gather in acooperative inquiry led by two teachers and drawing together severaldisciplines.<p>   On a recent Wednesday, for example, the point of emphasis was "evidence," tobe explored using Chaucerian England as its subject. Students looked atpaintings, historical documents, and literature from the period, to discover andthen to interpret the evidence. The groundwork was also laid for the school'semphasis on character building, through a Hogarth painting ("Gin Alley")portraying the despair caused by drug abuse- which itself will later be linkedto classes in health as well as art. Finally, the Hogarth painting was analyzedboth as historical evidence and as a model piece of propaganda. Throughout theclass, teachers who were not directly involved came in and out, keeping tabs onwhat was going on and balancing other responsibilities at the same time.<p>   This sort of team teaching sounds just short of perfect on paper, and Brimmer& May teachers are clearly inspired by their cooperative efforts. Still, even inthe rarefied air of a small private school it can be a scheduling nightmare,they admit. And the ambitious program keeps students and faculty both stretchedto the limits of their time and energy.<p><hr><h2>Who Has the Time?</h2><hr>In fact, time is a key factor in how well teachers can adapt to the new demandsof becoming generalists in the classroom. Only with substantial planning periodscan they work with teachers in other fields to design interdisciplinarycurricula; and if a course is also actually taught by more than one teacher, theplanning may be even more detailed. At the very least, everyone who tries thisagrees, one 45-minute planning period daily is essential; two is considered morereasonable, most say, and a longer time block reserved weekly is just asimportant. "We've got to find a way to give these teachers time to think," saysone frustrated principal. Such arrangements translate into a constant managementchore for principals and coordinators, one reason that beginning an EssentialSchool program takes far more than a summer to plan.<p>   "Don't undertake this unless you're going to fight like hell to make surethat somebody is providing time," says Marilyn Hohmann, principal of FairdaleHigh School in Louisville, Kentucky, a large urban high school which last yearadopted an Essential Schools program for its ninth grade. 'If teachers have towork evenings and Saturdays in order to do it, it's not going to work."<p><hr><h2>Autonomy Is an Issue</h2><hr>It takes time as well for a faculty to believe that it will gain power in asystem that focuses on generalist education. To shift towards team planning orteaching from a tradition of strong department heads, for example, can sparkconsiderable resistance. Principal Craig Larson of Parkway South High School inSt. Louis, Missouri, whose faculty will vote in January whether to move towardsa school-wide Essential program, says that "going slow is a real strong message.Department heads do lose some control when they go to teams, but the teams endup working so well that it works out okay." In general, most teachers concur,thinking through their curricula and classes in a team increases their sense ofinvolvement with the material and makes their work more interesting. And thesupport of a team encourages them to take intellectual risks, they say.<p>   Hohmann has won the strong support of her powerful teachers union by creatinga decision making model that puts control firmly in teachers' hands. "We have anelected steering committee made up of faculty, students, parents, andadministrators, with task forces to address certain issues," she says. "Thatcommittee is involved in every significant decision about our school. When achange like this is really school-based, it is a very powerful force."<p>   Many teachers involved in Essential Schools programs echo that satisfactionin being able to make curriculum and materials decisions themselves. At Brimmer& May, for example, a science teacher notes that she has control over allscience expenditures from equipment to trips. And at New York's Central ParkEast, that kind of decision is similarly in teacher's hands.<p><hr><h2>Staff Development</h2><hr>Still, many teachers moving towards a generalist approach want outside trainingand support for their new roles. Staff development is a major issue in EssentialSchools, and this too is most successful when it is designed by the teachersthemselves.<p>   "Everyone affected by a decision should have input into it," says PatCiabotti, who coordinates a comprehensive Coalition program at the Nova Schools,a complex of K12 public schools in Broward County, Florida. That is the majorprinciple guiding Nova's sweeping professional development program, which hasinvolved teachers in continuing training as they moved towards aninterdisciplinary plan. Nova recommends starting with a cooperatively devised"needs assessment," and then moving through a cycle of in-service activities,classroom trials, and evaluations as teachers and other staff continuallymonitor their own growth.<p>   The ideal such program, many teachers agree, is built into the school day;the degree to which a school can do so is indicative of its support for change."Without your principal's support you're doomed," one teacher says.<p>   Alan Guma, the principal of Bronxville High School in a suburb of New York,points out that teachers need a regular, structured way to collaborate andconfer with each other if they are to move towards an interdisciplinaryapproach. "They have to overcome not only their fears but also their training towork solo," he says. "Probably most teachers do more talking to each other atconferences than they do in their own schools."<p>   At Adelphi Academy, a private Coalition high school in Brooklyn, each teacherchooses two others to work with closely, observing and coaching each other."It's scary, new, and uncomfortable at first," says Gregory Borman, theEssential School program coordinator there. "Trust is a big part of it, and sois time."<p>  Start small and move slowly, experienced (Coalition schools advise. "The worstmistake you can make is to mandate instant change," says Bronxville's Alan Guma."You have to allow time to bring people along."<p><hr><h2>Teachers Who Resist</h2><hr>Still, resistance from within is a common phenomenon in Coalition schools,especially if a program's staff is seen as an elite group with specialprivileges. One young teacher tells how 15 to 20 teachers at her school met toexplore Coalition ideas in after-school sessions. "We were regarded astraitors," she says. "My department wanted to arrange for four teachers to plantogether in a common period. By the time September rolled around, the plan hadbeen scrapped because 'other teachers wouldn't like it.'"<p>   Teachers who must continue to struggle with 150 students in five periodsdaily often do look with resentment at those who are freed for regular planningperiods to work with fewer students. And to make matters worse, a school'sinterdisciplinary program sometimes resultsin the regular program's teachers having added students in their sections, orlosing favorite sections that they would otherwise teach. Elective courses oftensuffer when a school moves to the more stripped down Essential School program,and teachers outside the program worry about losing their jobs. For this reasonamong others, more schools are coming to believe that the school-within-a-schoolmodel is less effective than converting a whole school into an Essential School,one grade at a time.<p>   Some of education's finest teachers, of course, have long been quietlypracticing as generalists without fanfare or even notice. Older teachers whohave built interdisciplinary themes into their courses can feel ignored andunappreciated as younger colleagues are swept away by "new ideas." The extent towhich a school recognizes and uses these teachers in developing a new programcan be a useful measure of its success.<p>  The key to a comfortable faculty, says Brimmer & May's coordinator, JudyGuild, is not to impinge upon their course material but to support them bymaking bridges and connections that don't yet exist within a program. This mayoccur on both administrative levels-by scheduled time for faculty workshops, asNova Schools recommend-or on the grass-roots level, as teachers talk with otherteachers about their Essential School classes. "I've sat and listened toteachers wrassle with concepts that we've fooled around with forever," saysLouisville's Marilyn Hohmann, whose faculty hone their instructional skills inprofessional development schools she started with the help of her district. "Ifyou have confidence in your people, even a bad idea can be worked on until itbecomes a good idea."<p><hr><h2>Hiring: A Means for Change</h2><hr>A school looking for teachers who are generalists, of course, can also make thisa priority when hiring new staff. When a principal has total autonomy in hiring,this is more pleasure than problem; Brimmer & May, for example, seeks outteachers with broad backgrounds and a strong commitment to teaching across thedisciplines. But many larger public schools, such as Louisville's Fairdale HighSchool and New York's Central Park East, must work with district rules thatallow teachers to transfer automatically into an opening in their preferredschool after a number of years in the system. This may mean teachers who arriveat the last minute un-prepared and even unwilling to teach as generalists in anEssential School program.<p>   "I now have a committee of teachers that sits in with me and quizzes anapplicant for transfer," says Marilyn Hohmann. "I never before was able to turndown a teacher who wanted to transfer, and now they don't come on their own."Central Park East's Deborah Meier has had the same experience, and argues for"informed choice" regulations that would require a teacher to visit her schoolbefore being allowed to request transfer to it. "I talked two teachers out of itthis year," she says wryly, "who wanted to transfer here because they thought itwould be less work."<p>   In the end, teachers in Essential Schools say, their additional work pays offin a new sense of excitement about their work. "The students become like firstgraders again," says a teacher in Andover's Odyssey program. "They bring thingsin before class to show me and to talk about in class. Their enthusiasm is soinfectious."<p>   "The kind of education we're talking about," Deborah Meier told theCoalition's Fall Forum, "most kids experience only in kindergarten and in themost elite graduate schools in this country. Teacher student interaction ispersonalized; the kids have choices and so do their teachers; their interestsare taken seriously. Students are active agents, not passive recipients; and theteacher is coach, critic, editor, nurturer, watcher."<p>   Change in schools will occur, says Frank Newman of the Education Commissionof the States, because teachers and principals desperately want to be PART of-not the OBJECT of-a reform movement. "We cannot depend on heroic teachers andprincipals," he says. "We must create a system that works not just for thepioneers, but for the ordinary, good teachers and principals."<p> <hr>                 <H2>Essential Math and Science: How Can It Work?</H2><hr><STRONG>PROBLEM:</STRONG> your skateboard is stuck under a dumpster. To get it out, you have a 4'by 6' sheet of plywood and a curb. You weigh 150 pounds. Can you lift thedumpster to get it out, and how?<p>Faced with this question, students confront several of the Coalition's ninecommon principles at once: they must take steps on their own, with their teacheras coach, to solve a problem that calls on math and science together. The key tomaking it work is adopting the central Essential Schools metaphor of "student asworker," says CES's Amy Gerstein, a former science teacher herself. In summerworkshops and regional symposia, she is pressing teachers to abandon lecture-demonstrations so that students arrive at the principles of math and science asthe fruits of their own reasoning through a series of problems.<p>   "It's harder than in the humanities," she says, "but there are plenty ofteachers out there proving that it can be done." She points to Fox Lane HighSchool in Bedford, New York, where math teacher Glynn Meggison is continuallydeveloping new ways to turn students into workers without compromising acourse's content. Teachers leave the workshops Meggison helps lead with a newsense, Gerstein says, that any traditional lesson plan can be converted into amore active learning model. And they can call on a growing CES "curriculum bank"of examples drawn from successful classroom trials.<P>   Problems like the skateboard one above usually start with the assumption thatscientific inquiry demands mastery of certain math skills. Still, some teachersexpress worries that sequential skill development may suffer in an integratedclass, and many Essential School programs still use conventional math andscience classes instead.<p>   "It didn't quite work for us at first," says Steve Hoffman, a math teacher atthe Alternative Community School outside Ithaca, New York, whose "Inquiry andTools" program devised the skateboard problem. "For some kids, it was still tooabstract; even in small groups, they couldn't focus for ten to fifteen minutesat a time. And especially on standardized tests, their basic sequential mathskills were low."<p>   To solve the problem, teachers at his school separated math skillsdevelopment into a separate period, identifying fifteen skill areas thatstudents must master by the end of middle school. Working in small collaborativestudy groups, students have some choice as to the sequence of what they learn;and each student's progress is tracked with a folder of work. "It's a bigmanagement task," Hoffman says.<p>   Designing exhibitions of mastery that bring math and science skills togetheris a particular challenge. Hoffman envisions an eighth-grade exhibition wherestudents choose a place within 500 miles of home and plan a trip there, completewith budget, mileage, routes, and library research on cost-efficienttransportation and lodging.<p>   At Central Park East, writing, research, and art are integrated into scienceexhibitions at either a "competent" or an "advanced" level. For example,students compile data on themselves in a "Me Book," analyze fitness tests theycarry out in class, research some family medical trait or condition, orinterview a fitness specialist.<p>   Brimmer & May's ninth-grade science teacher, Jennifer Prileson, teachesscience in a historical perspective that involves its social and cultural sides.And because math is central to what she teaches, she spends time on it alone,dealing with algebra in physics expressions, for instance. In chemistry,Prileson uses "Structured Pacing in Chemistry Education" (Kendall/Hunt), whichabandons the lecturer role of the teacher in favor of individually structuredlaboratory-based activities. Writing and data analysis skills are an essentialpart of its method; so is individual teacher feedback as students progressthrough their chosen activities.<p> <hr><h2>Designing Assignments Across Disciplines</h2><hr>                    The challenge teachers face in integrating their course work across thedisciplines is often a matter of coming up with the right questions. At Brimmer& May School, the faculty uses Bloom's theory of the six levels of cognition-knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation-asthey design tasks for students. The result is assignments like this one from aninth-grade literature class:<p>   "In all literature there is nothing that touches or resembles the Prologue.It is the concise portrait of an entire nation, high and low, old and young,male and female, lay and clerical, learned and ignorant, rogue and righteous,land and sea, town and country, but without extremes .... The tales the pilgrimstell come from all over Europe, many of them from the works of Chaucer's nearcontemporaries. Some come from further afield, from the ancients, from theOrient. They exemplify the whole range of contemporary European imagination...." (From "Chaucer's Works," by Neville Coghill, tr., CANTERBURY TALES(Penguin Books, 1984).<p>   In each group follow the format of searching as stated below:<p><OL>   <LI> Search for facts about the various people and how they fit into society.      List them on a sheet of paper.<LI> Interpret the collection of facts and try to determine the expected role      or behavior of each person.   <LI>What does the Prologue tell you about society and human behavior?   <LI> Do you see any patterns of this type of social condition in the art you      have observed or the history you have read?   <LI> If you were on a pilgrimage, what social statement would you be making?</OL><p>   "Not only are we crossing disciplines in the content of these questions,across art, history, and English," says Guild, "but we are crossing them inskills as well. In math and science as well as in the humanities, we arepracticing looking for patterns as a way of problem solving."<p><hr><h2>What About Teacher Education?</h2><hr>The schools and not the ed schools are the real training ground for teachers whowould be generalists, says Theodore Sizer, who heads Brown University'seducation department and the Coalition of Essential Schools. That "tough andrealistic" assessment, he says, comes from a sense that the problems involved;are so immediate that "we can't wait for them to be solved at the universitylevel."<p>   Sizer is sharply critical of colleges and universities that reward futureteachers for being narrow specialists. "In Europe, teachers expect to expandtheir scholarship throughout their careers," he says. "Only in America do wethink that a teacher is supposed to endlessly repeat what he specialized in atthe age of 21 in college."<p>   Many teachers are bound by a cultural stereotype, he argues, that assumesthat teachers are not scholars. This is directly contradicted, he points out, bythe growing number of inquiring teachers who may even have chosen to teach inhigh school precisely so they can think and teach more broadly than at a higherlevel.<p>   Efforts to put a generalist philosophy in place must start, Sizer says, atthe in-service rather than the pre-service level. Schools should encourage theirteachers, with money and time, to investigate fields related to theirspecialties, he says. "If I'm a math teacher, I should be able to work up somephysics or astronomy."<p>   Many programs, such as the Holmes Group (based at Michigan State University)and the Carnegie Forum's Task Force on Teaching as a Profession, aimed toaddress this problem by reforming both teacher education and the professionalsystem in which they work. And some programs do exist that spur teachers todevelop interdisciplinary approaches. At Framingham State College inMassachusetts, for example, the Schweitzer International Resource Center bringsteachers together to develop cross-cultural perspectives in a variety ofcourses. And Brown's own teacher education program sends M.A.T. candidates andundergraduates into Rhode Island public schools with support from "clinicalprofessors" in various academic disciplines. This is only part of a larger Browninstitute offering programs to teachers and administrators throughout the state.<p>   "The incentive is that it's great fun to teach broadly," Ted Sizer says. TheCoalition's job, as he sees it, is to make that possible from the front lines ofteaching first, and let the education schools follow as they will. <p><hr><H2>Information and Resources </H2><hr>For more information on the Essential Schools programs referred to in thisissue, contact:<p><DIR><LI>Alternative Community School<br>111 Chestnut Street<br>Ithaca, NY 14850<br>(607) 274-2183<p><LI>Andover High School<br>Andover, MA 01810<br>(617) 470-1707<p><li>Adelphi Academy<br>8515 Ridge Boulevard<br>Brooklyn, NY 11209<br>(718) 238-3308<p><li>The Brimmer & May School<br>69 Middlesex Road<br>Chestnut Hill, MA 02167<br>(617) 566-7462<p><li>Bronxville High School<br>Pondfield Road<br>Bronxville, NY 10029<br>(914) 337-5600<p><li>Central Park East Secondary School<br>1573 Madison Avenue<br>New York, NY 10029<br>(212) 860-8935<p><li>Fairdale High School<br>1001 Fairdale Road<br>Louisville, KY 40118<br>(502) 455-8248<p><li>Fox Lane High School<br>Rte. 172, So.

And once every couple of months, on an early release day forstudents, the administration got you all together for "in-service training" or"staff development." Maybe an expert came in and gave a presentation; maybe youwent to a seminar at a nearby conference center. You spent a few hours, maybeyou got a few new ideas. And then you went back into your classroom and shut thedoor.<p>   Perhaps those new ideas took root, and had a permanent effect on how and whatyou teach. But an increasing body of research reveals that staff developmentalong these lines is virtually a waste of time--that such sporadic lectures, nomatter how inspiring or provocative the subject, are too isolated from actualclassroom practice to have much effect on helping teachers grow in theirprofession. And if the goal is fundamental school change from the bottom up,Essential School people say, it must come about not through occasional advicefrom experts but in a more fluid, collaborative way, sustained by an activenetwork of teachers sharing their own experiences. The Coalition's goal becomesnot only to rethink classroom practices, then, but to redesign just as radicallythe entire process of professional development.<p>   The challenge this presents to a quickly growing Coalition is considerable.Most school people get their first exposure to the nine common principlesthrough reading Theodore Sizer's book <i>Horace's Compromise</i>, or visiting nearbyEssential Schools. Many become interested after trying out "student-as-worker"activities that spark new ideas for additional classroom change. But once aschool begins serious planning towards joining the Coalition, how can staffdevelopment itself reflect Essential School principles as teachers work towardchanging their classrooms and restructuring their schools?<p>   This has become a central question for the Coalition, and over CES's firstfive years an entirely different approach to staff development has begun toemerge. Instead of listening to periodic presentations about various techniquesor content areas, teachers are struggling with essential questions, becomingactive learners, collaborating with their peers, applying critical skills to arange of subject areas. Instead of new ideas being poured into their heads as ifthey were passive receptacles, they generate ideas from their own experience,coached by those who have been through the same thing before them. They focusmore narrowly and go deeper, rather than submitting to a scattershot array of"in-service training" courses.<p>   During the Coalition's start-up years, such training has taken placeprimarily in three contexts. In introductory workshops at regional symposia,teachers see new techniques modeled by Coalition trainers and try them out forthemselves through various exercises. (See Figure 1.) At the Summer Institutesin Providence and St. Louis, they can work with actual high school students overa two-week period, teaching interdisciplinary courses that incorporate EssentialSchool ideas such as exhibitions, with the help of Coalition facilitators. (SeeFigure 2.) And when a school is ready to begin serious planning for change, theCoalition offers a year-long training activity known as "the Trek," which guidesa core team of teachers and administrators through a process of analysis andreflection aimed at creating and managing a schoolwide vision of change. (SeeFigure 3.) In addition to this, the Thomson Fellows program, established withfunding from the Danforth Foundation, has brought seasoned Essential Schoolprincipals into schools to initiate staff conversations about change.<p>   But as it enters its second five years, the Coalition finds itself in a newsituation. For the first time, there are enough well-established Essentialschools to supply real-world examples of change to other schools, both in theclassroom and at the structural level. At the same time--partly because of theburgeoning Re:Learning initiative, a joint effort of the Coalition and theEducation Commission of the States--so many schools are asking for EssentialSchool training that the resources of the movement are under considerablestrain. Some of the strongest and most well known Essential schools are undersimilar pressures; New York's Central Park East, for instance, has establishedthe Center for Collaborative Education to accommodate its visitors and at thesame time shield its own program from distraction, and Thayer High School in NewHampshire has begun charging outsiders to visit the school or consult withteachers. (See Figure 4.) The Trek program is regionalizing and concentratingits efforts so that costs for participating schools can be kept down. And theSummer Institutes must figure out how to provide adequate guidance for teacherswho come looking for models of classroom change.<p><hr><h2>Now, Coaches for Teachers</h2><hr>To address these challenges of growth, the Coalition has launched a new andambitious program, which has been funded by Citibank  over a three-year initialperiod. Designed to provide teacher-centered staff development in an expandingnetwork of schools, the Citibank Coalition Faculty Project puts experiencedEssential school teachers into other schools to help as they work towardschange. The Citibank faculty member is a classroom coach experienced in the waysschool structures change as pedagogies shift, who serves as consultant andresource person, helping to diagnose and overcome barriers on the path tobecoming an Essential school.<p>   The first fourteen Citibank faculty members were trained at Brown during thesummer of 1990, working with teachers enrolled in the Summer Institute. They arejust beginning their year-long liaisons with "client schools," an arrangement inwhich the Citibank faculty member works closely--either alone or in a team--withone or two nearby schools. Citibank faculty members, who are paid $3,500 fortheir summer training, receive 20 release days during the year to work withpartner schools; those schools pay their substitute fees plus a $75 preparationfee and travel expenses for each visit.<p>   Like other Coalition training programs, the Citibank project differssubstantially from what teachers and schools are used to thinking of as staffdevelopment. "It's all part of a PRACTICE-BASED approach to staff development,"says Dartmouth education professor Faith Dunne, who has been working with PaulaEvans and Gene Thompson at Brown to design the Citibank Faculty project."Teachers as well as students learn by having things modeled for them. Once theystart to see things working in practice, then it can move into theory--not theother way around."<p>   If it is left to a random pattern in which teachers work on what they wantwhen they want, though, staff development will lack the direction it needs toresult in the steady building of an Essential School, Dunne argues. "It's got tobe an active laboratory, a network, a web continually spreading within theschool and the system," she says. "That web requires a spider--continually makingpatterns, expanding the ties, making new paths to a coherent direction." Whetherthe Citibank faculty member, experienced in the ways of Essential schools andtrained in facilitating change, can be that spider, or whether a Trek team orother committed individuals serve that role instead, is less important than thefact that teachers are at the center of the efforts to help them grow in theirprofession and change their schools.<p><hr><h2>How Teachers Make Change</h2><hr>As we spoke with teachers about these practice-based staff development models, apicture began to emerge of how such teacher-centered programs can workseparately and together, of the problems they face, and of the new ways teachersare beginning to solve those problems.<p>   For one thing, it is clear that school change doesn't necessarily happenschoolwide; it happens one person at a time. A participant in the SummerInstitute might bring back new ideas from his seminars and try them out on afriend or two; they might end up proposing to link their courses for aparticular project; and that might lead to more extensive teaming. Or it couldbe as simple as teachers visiting each others' classes from time to time, andtalking informally about the things they're trying to do.<p>   Even after a school has decided to join the Coalition, change will only takeplace over a considerable time period, and the order in which it takes place isby no means predetermined. A school might join the Trek, for example, toinitiate the first schoolwide discussion of its own goals; and then it mightbring a Citibank faculty person in to help carry the conversation on at theclassroom level. Alternatively, a Citibank faculty member might suggest to herclient school, after some initial work, that it might send people to the Trek orthe Summer Institute; or she might hook it up with other resources that could beof help.<p>   Both the Trek and the Citibank Faculty program are designed to get thatperson-by-person change going, in a way tailored to the school's own situation.If a school sends a team to the Trek, for instance, those teachers andadministrators should come back trained to work with their colleagues toward aclearly articulated vision of where their school is going, and to manage thechanges required. This might involve leading workshops in which staff candiagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the school, or modeling EssentialSchool principles with the rest of the faculty participating.<p>   A client school typically asks to work with a Citibank faculty member afterit has identified what issues it wants to work on. "It might be struggling withthe tone of the school, or with exhibitions, or with tracking, for example,"says Faith Dunne. "The Citibank person is there to help a school mobilize itsown resources, to identify useful outside resources, to help schools overbarriers when they encounter them, and to make sure that Coalition principlesremain at the heart of the effort." In practice, this may mean helping a teacherfigure out how to pose a central question on which to focus a math class, orworking with two teachers on arranging a cross-disciplinary team, or visiting aclassroom and suggesting other ways than worksheets to keep track of studentmastery.<p>   Many Citibank faculty members have already experienced first hand, in theirown schools, the difficulty of that task. "If you're wise you don't 'bother'people," says Wilbur Johnson, a social studies teacher at Bronxville High Schoolin suburban New York and one of the first group of Citibank faculty. "You havelunch, you ask about their curriculum. You say, 'I'm doing Copernicus at thesame time you're doing astronomy; maybe we can do a unit together.' Onceteachers start to work together they really enjoy it."<p>   When the Citibank faculty member comes in to work with a client school on aregular basis, Johnson says, sensitive listening to the teachers there iscrucial. "We are definitely not there to say what needs to be changed," heasserts. "At most schools anywhere in the country, the people who are consideredgood teachers are already doing things that by some other name are very muchlike Essential school principles. The conversation has to start with how whatthey are doing fits in to the picture." Other teachers become entrenched in oldhabits or burned out, Johnson notes, because nobody treats them as "genuinelycurious people who see a chance to learn in anything. They are entrenchedbecause they were neglected," he argues. "But what even a burned-out teacheronce liked about the job is really the same things I like. The key is tofacilitate those things, to get the teacher engaged again, the same way we allwant our students to be engaged."<p>   "You want to approach those teachers who are willing to do even one thing,"agrees Steve Poynter, another Citibank faculty member who moved from Arkansas'sSpringdale High School Essential School program to teach at Pasadena High Schoolin California this year. "It won't work to get the whole faculty together andsay 'We're going to work on making you guys into an Essential school.' It worksone little bit at a time, one person to another person standing in the hallrelaxing after work with a leg against the wall."<p><hr><h2>Teachers Coaching Each Other</h2><hr>Poynter has been working with Dave Marsh, a CES regional coordinator forSouthern California and a University of Southern California professor there, onnonthreatening techniques for coaching colleagues in the classroom. "We'd liketeachers to learn to do these same things with each other," he says. "Teacherscan go into each other's classrooms and give simple feedback, collaborate witheach other and help each other out. You can pick some one thing you'd like towork on--like your questioning technique, for example: maybe you'd like to beasking questions in class that stimulate higher-order thinking. Then you getanother teacher to come in and watch for just that one thing. Afterwards, youget together and talk. You say what you were trying to do; the other guy sayswhat he saw. It's not evaluation, it's not criticism, it's not done by asupervisor. It's observing and reflecting, done as equals who can help eachother."<p>   Another way to enlist teachers in their own professional development is todirectly involve them in presenting workshops to other staff. Instead of doing aworkshop <i>for</i> a partner school (or their own), many Citibank faculty members say,they invite another teacher to do it with them. At her small Massachusettsprivate school, Brimmer and May science teacher Jen Prileson helped arrangeworkshops that explored questions of cooperative learning, problem solving, andthe use of seminars. "A math teacher and an art teacher did something on problemsolving in math and art," she says. "I did one on cooperative learning with afirst grade teacher. We need to value teachers who aren't what we call'experts.' Once the Citibank faculty member goes back home, teachers canmushroom out from things like this and do workshops on their own."<p>   "Staff development isn't something that should be done to a staff," agreesMichael Patron, a humanities teacher and administrator at the Crefeld School inPhiladelphia, and a Citibank faculty member. "If teachers have a way of talkingto each other as a group and determining their own needs, they can decide whatthey can provide for each other and when they need experts."<p><hr><h2>Who Is the Expert?</h2><hr>So is the Citibank person an "expert"? The answer seems to depend on whether theword carries negative connotations for the speaker. "Facilitation is a largepart of my job, but I'm not a blind facilitator--in a way I am an expert," saysPatron. "I have access to articles, examples from other places, and of course myown experience at an Essential School." Other Citibank faculty prefer toemphasize their collegial role instead. "I make no bones about not being anexpert but a colleague," says Bronxville's Wilbur Johnson. "I've had a chance tofocus on these issues because of the Citibank training, but I come from my ownexperience. If you're interested, you can join my experience; but I expect tolearn as much from any one of these people as they are going to get from me."<p>   Part of the problem, Johnson agrees with Patron, is that "experts" havetraditionally been inflicted on staff by management decision, not requested byteachers. "Attitude is a large part of how well it works," he says. "We are realteachers who want you to come visit our classrooms too."<p>   "We would lose interest if we thought of ourselves as experts here," saysJude Pelchat, a Citibank Faculty member and a math and science teacher at SchoolOne in Providence, Rhode Island. "This project reflects the kind of ongoing,personal, reflective learning that good teachers do all the time. Good teachersare compulsive learners, not experts."<p>   A 25-year teaching veteran, Pelchat has a long history of working withteachers; for some years she has helped give workshops at Coalition symposia.The Citibank project, she says, gives teachers a degree of support they haven'tfelt until now. "I think that left to themselves teachers would have come upwith something like this," Pelchat says. "They need a form of communication thatis familiar to them. What's important is that the consultant comes from theclassroom." Working on an ongoing basis with other teachers, she argues, giveseven very experienced teachers the courage they need to try out new things. "Itcan be just as hard for a seasoned teacher to step away from something she feelsis a sure system," Pelchat says.<p><hr><h2>Crossing Disciplines, Grades</h2><hr>As teachers start coaching each other, the notion of "expert" frays in anotherway, because they realize how much they have to offer even to teachers in otherdisciplines. Many Citibank faculty members say their eyes were opened to newcollaborative possibilities at the Summer Institute, where part of theirtraining is to lead classes with a diverse group of participating teachers andstudents. "I taught a course in chemistry and math," says Jude Pelchat. "But Iwas assigned to work with an elementary teacher from New Mexico, a sixth gradeteacher from California, and a high school drafting teacher from Washington,D.C. At the first meeting we didn't have much to say to each other; but beforelong we had tons to say, and soon we clearly had a common purpose. Theelementary teacher, for example, came away with a different way of teachingmath: starting where kids are, and not being afraid to enjoy things. As a resultshe started to tackle more difficult things. Our class had been based ondetecting patterns for categorizing ideas in science and math, and she taught asession based on identifying different kinds of rocks."<p>   Several other Citibank teachers, also, are paired with client schools quitedifferent from their own in size and student demographics. But working with awide range of teachers and students during the Summer Institute, they say,helps; and frequently, differences end up being smaller than they first appear."My partner school has a large vocational program and they're trying to figureout how to make it work with Essential School principles," says Mary Vasey, anEnglish teacher at Iowa's Metro High School and a Citibank faculty member pairedwith a Cincinnati high school. "We're much smaller, but we're also working onways to get our vocational program to focus not just on jobs but on using mindswell."<p><hr><h2>What About Resistance?</h2><hr>But Citibank faculty do worry about how to deal with resistance and evenhostility to the EssentialSchool ideas they bring. The ideal situation, of course, is when they areinvited to a school by the teachers themselves, and welcomed as colleagues. Butsometimes they find themselves working with people who feel pressured to changethe way they teach all at once, on orders from above.<p>   "I once helped lead a five-day workshop on exhibitions for three schools inLos Angeles," says Pasadena's Steve Poynter. "School was coming up, and theteachers there needed to plan their whole year's curriculum in a week. Instead,here they were mucking around with another measly little assignment to design anexhibition. They just said, 'We're not going to do it. We've got too much elseto do to worry about this.'"<p>   That first day "almost defeated me," Poynter says. "I couldn't work from mynotes, so I just shut my mouth and listened. Eventually they worked it out forthemselves. They were most concerned about how they were going to do exhibitionsthat took a lot of time, and still have time to cover all the material theyneeded to cover in the year's curriculum.  Finally one gentleman from the mathdepartment stood up and said, 'I've been taking calculus apart. I spent about 80hours doing it, and I've thrown out a lot of stuff that does not need to betaught. Now if there were things that you could throw out of an algebra class,what would they be?'"<p>   It wasn't long, Poynter says, before the group rose to the challenge, andeventually they came up with some very good exhibitions. "When you're focused oncovering a certain amount of content," he points out, "you can't relax your mindenough to design exhibitions that might take extra time. You have to cover lessmaterial if you're going to come up with authentic performances." But theprocess took five days of steady work, a luxury not available in most staffdevelopment structures. "And the whole thing could have been worthless withoutfeedback and followup," he adds. "We are continuing to get together and talkabout how the plan is working out in the classroom."<p><hr><h2>Having More Time Helps</h2><hr>Sustaining the staff development program over an extended period, both Citibankand Trek people agree, contributes tremendously to its effectiveness. "We've allseen good ideas come and go," says Mary Vasey. "Often they get discarded purelybecause not enough time has been spent talking about them, making an effort. Thebeauty of this approach is not that it's brand new, but that it puts thingstogether in a sustained way. It may not answer all your questions then andthere; it may not tell you 'the answer' from 'the expert,' but in the long runit works better."<p>   A sustained approach to coaching teachers also reflects the Coalition'spedagogical principles, points out Jude Pelchat, who has long experience ingiving more sporadically timed workshops for staff. "In a way, I had beentreating teachers worse than my own students," she says. "In the context of aone-time workshop it's difficult to know the context of what they're thinkingand learning, and to give them the chance to try something for long enough tohave it last."<p>   With 20 release days from their teaching schedules to work with otherschools, Citibank faculty do worry about meeting the needs of their own studentsas they work with other schools. The more integrated their school's curriculumis, it seems, the fewer problems this poses. At Baltimore's Walbrook HighSchool, says English teacher and Citibank faculty member Dorothy Turner, longertime blocks and team teaching make it possible for her to take a day away fromschool without creating problems.<p><hr><h2>Teachers as Learners</h2><hr>What links all the Coalition's staff development projects--the introductoryworkshops, the Summer Institute, the Trek, and the Citibank project--is the factthat teachers are  active learners in their own professional education. Becomingstudents themselves makes classroom change more real, and in many cases moredifficult, because as often as not change generates chaos and anger. But ratherthan sidestepping those problems, these models put them to use. "The SummerInstitute participants, for instance, are involved directly in the class's work,alongside the high school students--doing labs with them, participating indiscussion groups, creating lesson plans inspired by their own questions andthose of other students," says Citibank's science teacher Jen Prileson. "Thatparticipation has a large part in addressing resistance to these new ideas. Theycan voice exactly where they have problems with the ideas, and work out possibleanswers."<p>   Interestingly, the intensive weeks of training for Citibank faculty show muchthe same picture of the dynamic of change going on even among Essential Schoolveterans. Day-to-day notes from their sessions reveal passionate disagreementsand discussions about the meaning of the nine common principles and thepractical problems they present. The questions these teacher-coaches wrestlewith may be the best window of all into the process of change:<p>   "Does everyone have to master the Pythagorean theory? What happens if youcan't or don't or don't want to?" <p>   "What is the necessary relationship between mastery and meritocracy? Does onenecessarily assume the other?"<p>   "What if education is not a priority of the community? Should we eliminateacademics in favor of football?"<p>   "Isn't it vital that teachers be experts in their own field of knowledge, andhave the appropriate wisdom to assist students in this field first?"<p>   "Does perceiving of oneself as an expert in one field get in the way ofhelping students make connections?"<p>   "How do we reeducate ourselves and live together democratically, when so muchof our experience is of dominating and being dominated?"<p>   Active, searching, specific, such questions show a growing belief that, inthis movement toward Essential schooling, what teachers think and how they actis the most important thing of all. And as teachers ask these questions, theclassroom door that once was shut is opening. Teachers are talking to each otherabout how their students learn, and in the process they seem to be discovering anew way of learning themselves. <p><hr>    <h2>    Figure 1: Introductory Workshops: The Teacher As Active Learner</h2><hr>"People often come to the Coalition's introductory workshops wanting to learn'how to do it,'" says CES's Beverly Simpson, who with Director for Schools BobMcCarthy runs a good many of those workshops at regional symposia. "What theylearn first, though, is that there is no 'it' to swallow and take home. Just asa good coach can help the athlete play the best game depending on his ownpersonal strengths and style, the teacher has to create 'it' in her own right."<p>   In traditional teacher education, Simpson points out, teachers learn theymust cover a certain amount of material, and textbooks suggest every move theymake. What her workshops emphasize instead is teachers' own knowledge of whatworks best for them and for their students. To get to this point, Coalitionworkshops put participants in the student's role as often as not, asking them toexperience directly what works for them.<p>   "In one exercise, we ask small groups to come up with the most powerfullearning experiences they have ever had, in or out of school," Simpson says."From those stories, we extract what the conditions are under which reallearning takes place." The answers are revealing: one group reported, forexample, that almost all its stories revolved around near-disasters. "Theyconcluded that we learn a lot from our mistakes," Simpson says. "But in many ofour classrooms, we tend to mark down for mistakes--we dismiss them as learningtools."<p>   Another story described a merely average student who unexpectedly scoredextremely well on standardized tests one year. "Her teachers began to pay extraattention to her, urging her to live up to her full potential," Simpson says."By the time it was discovered that the scorers had made an error, her gradeshad already gone substantially up."<p>   One of the things introductory workshops try to model, Simpson notes, is thatteachers don't necessarily have all the answers. "Anything we learn well welearn by doing ourselves; so we encourage teachers to believe that they can doit," she says. "I've seen incredibly creative people leave believing for thefirst time that they can do things their way. When you go through this, youstart to appreciate the anxieties students go through when there's no rightanswer--when they have to look actively at the alternatives, and evaluate themfor themselves."<p><hr>                 <h2>   Figure 2: The Summer Teachers Institute</h2><hr>What is an Essential School classroom really like, on a day-to-day basis? Whatdo teachers do? How do students respond? What are the problems? The rewards? AtCoalition Summer Teachers Institutes, several dozen teachers come together toaddress these questions in a week or two of workshops and practice teaching.Past Summer Institutes have been held at Brown University in Providence, RhodeIsland and in St. Louis (where it is sponsored by two Essential schools,Whitfield School and Parkway South); students from the surrounding area attendclasses, and participating teachers are coached in Essential School pedagogy andcurriculum.<p>   In Providence, Institute participants work in groups of three or four withCoalition staff and Citibank Faculty members. These teams plan and teach a five-day integrated curriculum unit to a heterogeneous group of high school students.Participants spend their mornings planning, teaching, and "debriefing" theirtwo-hour classes. Afternoons are spent in an intensive seminar, exploringcurricular and pedagogical issues that emerge from Essential School practice.Both institutes emphasize the relationship between good theory and goodpractice; its aim is that participants leave with an array of practical teachingresources and strategies grounded in the nine common principles.<p>   The 1991 Summer Institute at Brown will address a range of questions,including:<p><ul>    <li>Recent school reforms: What are they? Where are they going? Where does the         Coalition of Essential Schools fit in?    <li>What do the nine common principles mean in practice?     <li>How does change happen, for people and for institutions?     <li>How can a teacher create a student-centered classroom  and promote         active student engagement?     <li>What is non-traditional assessment? How do portfolios, authentic         performances, and exhibitions work?     <li>How do teachers plan an integrated curriculum?</ul><p>The program is open to secondary teachers and administrators. Three graduatecredits are available in some instances. The cost is around $600 per participantplus travel and living expenses.<p><hr>                       <h2> Figure 3: How Does the Trek Work?</h2><hr>The Trek is a year-long staff development activity involving a core team ofteachers and administrators who are trained to envision, plan for, and managechange within their own system. It starts with a five-day summer trainingsession; later activities include site visits to partner Trek schools that serveas "critical friends." Schools generally send a team of three to six teachersand administrators to the Trek, possibly including school board members orcentral office administrators. About 50 schools have been through the processthus far. The cost in 1990-91 is $800 per participant, plus travel expenses andsubstitute fees during site visits.<p>   The Trek is aimed primarily at how to manage change at the school and systemlevel. "Trek may be the first step that a faculty takes collectively," says theCoalition's Pat Wasley, a senior researcher who leads Trek workshops. "It's abeginning journey; typically it takes place during the first real year ofplanning."<p>   The Trek starts with each team making a thorough investigation and analysisof its school.  Using different analytical "lenses," the team examines thepriorities, assumptions, and compromises implicit in each facet of its school,and comes up with key conditions that are necessary for it to change. A crucialpart of the process is to articulate a shared vision of the school as it is andas it could ideally be, and to consider ways of getting from one place to theother.<p>   After the five-day summer session together, the Trek team returns to itsschool with a framework for change, some tools to carry it out, and a plan forengaging the rest of a school's faculty. Working collaboratively and serving asa model for group decision-making, the team enlists support and leadership fromothers in the community. Team members lead discussion groups, model what theyhave learned about Coalition principles, and encourage others to visit EssentialSchools and reflect together on how they work.<p>   To check their own progress and to keep up the ties they have built withother Trek members, each school hosts a visit from two other schools' Trekteams. The visitors serve as "critical friends," trained to observe and helpsolve problems; they may visit classes or talk to the larger faculty; and theyalso present their own ongoing problems for the host team to help with.<p>   As the Trek program builds, the Coalition hopes to create clusters of Trekschools within geographic regions, so critical-friend relationships will beeasier and less expensive. Towards that end, Delaware ran a regional Trek justbefore the 1990 Coalition Fall Forum. "It would be wonderful to have theconnections be closer to home," says principal Valerie Woodruff of Delaware'sMiddletown High School, which sent a team to the 1989 Trek. "Our site visitswith partner schools were a wonderful experience, an authentic check on how wewere living up to our vision."<p><hr>                     <h2>Figure 4: Thayer's Traveling Teachers</h2><hr>How can teachers from a financially strapped district share their successfulteaching strategies and earn good money along the way? Dennis Littky, the NewHampshire principal of Thayer High School who has won fame as "Doc" in the bookof the same title, has come up with one answer.  As Thayer's Essential Schoolhas attracted widespread interest for turning around a floundering student bodythrough team teaching and active learning, Doc Littky has sent his teachers onthe road in teams to consult with school systems all around the country.<p>   Thayer teachers get $350 a day plus expenses for their labors, and havetraveled from tiny Winchester, New Hampshire to Minneapolis, San Diego, SantaFe, and Pennsylvania to coach other teachers on how to achieve change. Butthough they welcome the travel and extra pay, teachers say they are mostenthusiastic about their task because it strengthens their own teaching andleadership skills. "I've watched colleague after colleague get very strong,"says Edorah Frazer, who teaches science, math, and typing to Thayer seventh-graders. "Dennis is very charismatic, and when he goes with a team it's a surebet that people will sit up and listen. But when we go out without him, wereally come into our own."<p>   Working with other teachers in fields often different from their own makesthese teachers realize the skills they have developed while teaming across thedisciplines at Thayer. "You find that you can sit down with any team and after alot of effort you can belong," says seventh-grade English and math teacherMarlene Morse. And Peter Eisenstadter, an English teacher in a 9-10 team, saysthat leading groups on how to turn students into active workers has galvanizedhis own classroom teaching. "I used to be an actor, and for me teaching was likeputting on five shows a day," he says. "When you have to come down off the stageand mix it up, it's very different. I don't think I even knew quite what I wassupposed to be doing until I had to teach someone else how to do it."<p>   Aside from planning their workshops together and calling on their ownEssential School experiences, Thayer teachers bring little formal training totheir consulting jobs, and many of them say it's better that way. "We set upworkshops in a fishbowl setting," says Edorah Frazer. "They might give us asubject for a hypothetical team-taught unit, and then they watch as we sit downand plan how to teach it together. That's the key: They see us do it, see thatwe talk and think the same way they do. We're not experts; we're teachers likethem." The end effect, they say, is a feeling of collegiality that defusesinitial resistance to new methods. "When our team went to Minneapolis theteachers there were pretty hostile at first, because they had been told they hadto do this," says special ed teacher Trudy Wright. "By the end of the week theywere giving us standing ovations, flowers, presents--and we're going back nextweek to work with them some more."<p>   Two-thirds of Thayer's teachers went on the road last year, says Littky, andhe fields dozens of requests for help each week. Characteristically, he hasturned the overload from an annoyance to an asset; Thayer now charges visitors$100 per day, and pays a retired teacher to coordinate and arrange all visits.(In a similar move, New York's Central Park East has established the Center forCollaborative Education to handle its ferocious load of outside visitors.) In aschool district where salaries are among the lowest in the nation, Littky says,sending teachers out to share their expertise  is "the healthiest thing I'veever done. It increases salaries and self-esteem at the same time. One teachertold me she had been teaching for 23 years and this was the first time that shehad ever been treated and paid like a professional."<p><hr>                             <h2> Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or comingeditions.

But Cathy Fischer, an M.Ed.candidate from theUniversity of New Hampshire, was taking it like a pro.<p>   With the dozen students in her daily advisory groupsession, shecooperated in a self-esteem exercise led by three girls fromapsychology class as their final project. Signing yearbookson the run,she made it to her history class on time, where threestudents presentedtheir final reports before their peers. She would have tostep in nextperiod as substitute for her absent colleague, but a year atthe schoolhad left her with a first-name knowledge of its students andtheirpersonalities. After a brief critical reflection with avisitor on thestudent work just presented, Cathy called the new group ofrestlesseleventh-graders to order; and within minutes she had themfocusingthoughtfully on their classmates' presentations, askingsubstantivequestions about the work, and following the questions upwith livelydebate.<p>   Cathy Fischer starts this fall at Souhegan High, abeginning teacherwith a masters degree. But she might as well have had ayear'sexperience added to her place on the salary scale from thestart. In agroundbreaking arrangement with UNH, Souhegan actually hireseight pre-certification masters candidates at a modest $3,000 fee fora fullyear's internship-then integrates them completely into thelife of theschool, giving them real responsibility in a closelymentoredenvironment. Fischer, a confident young woman who herselfgraduated in1988 from the regional high school, was one of two internswho took aclass from the start completely on her own.<p>   Souhegan's interns had a substantial advantage: they cameto theexperience with Essential School ideas solidly under theirintellectualbelts. In seminars at UNH with education professor TonyWagner andothers, they had explored the ideas of Theodore Sizer andlike-mindedreformers, and their academic experiences had centeredaround cross-disciplinary essential questions. "Cathy brought tremendousinsight intoEssential School ideas into our sessions," says BayardBrokaw, the U.S.history teacher with whom Fischer worked on curriculumplanning. "Shewas always prompting us to focus and simplify our essentialquestions."<p>   Fischer's experience could be duplicated in only ahandful ofsituations nationwide. Much more commonly, student teachersin theUnited States have learned the theories of education in thelecturehalls of the university-taking courses in "methods" fromcollegeeducation professors-and then endured a one-semesterinitiation in thebumptious, harried classrooms of the public schools. Thecontradictionbetween theory and practice, any veteran teacher will tellyou, is oftenso profound that, for an observant participant in theprocess, theelements of a teacher's education actually cancel each otherout. Andthe accompanying erosion of trust between universities andthe schoolsthey prepare teachers for has only made the gap between themworse.<p>   What happens to such a system of educating new teacherswhen publicschools begin to propel themselves toward Essential Schoolchange? Doesthe slow-paced, hierarchical, research-oriented, discipline-baseduniversity education school have any part to play in thelickety-split,pragmatic, grassroots messiness of a high school rethinkingeverythingfrom departmental distinctions to final exams? As one systemrubs upagainst the other, does the fault line eventually split themmore widelyapart? Or can school and university each begin to alter theother'sconsciousness, question old assumptions, see aims in newways and devisenew means for reaching them? Perhaps most controversial, whoshouldcontrol the process of educating teachers in a time offundamentalschool change?<p>   Thoughtful reformers have been asking these questionspersistentlysince the mid-1980s wave of school reform began with thepublication ofthe highly critical U.S. government report A Nation at Risk.From JohnGoodlad's Center for Educational Renewal (based at theUniversity ofWashington) to the Holmes Group (a nationwide consortium of96 educationschools committed to school reform), a heightenedconsciousness hasarisen of the importance of teacher education to changingpractice inschools, and vice versa.<p>   The American Association of Colleges for TeacherEducation, theEducation Commission of the States, and ColumbiaUniversity's NationalCenter for Restructuring Education, Schools, and Teaching(NCREST) areamong many influential groups calling for "professionaldevelopmentschools" (also known as clinical schools or partnershipschools), whereuniversities and schools might collaborate to prepare newteachers, torenew the professional knowledge of veteran teachers, and toconductsite-based research into teaching and learning.<p>   But only in the last few years have the first answers tothe dilemmasof teacher education in a time of school reform begun toemerge. Andthey come in the most concrete of forms- beginning teacherswho havebeen systematically coached, through sustained classroommodeling,practice, and reflection, in the principles of the CoalitionofEssential Schools. In a handful of widely scattered effortsincludingseveral well-developed Coalition member schools, newpartnerships are inprogress that ground teacher education firmly in schools inthe midst ofchange.<p>   "We want to do teacher education ONLY in schools that arein theprocess of restructuring," says Lynne Miller, a Universityof SouthernMaine education professor who heads the Southern MainePartnership, aninnovative program closely linking the University ofSouthern Maine witha rapidly developing regional network that includes a numberofCoalition member schools. "That means no part of theagenda-new teacherpreparation, teacher development in the schools, and schoolrenewal-takes place in isolation; they all touch on each other. Whenyou placeteacher ed students in good schools engaged in self-reflection andchange, they learn not only good classroom practice, but howto beprofessionals teaching and learning in a process thateffects thatchange. It's not a lesson plan-it's a process of activeinquiry."<p>   The Southern Maine Partnership is part of John Goodlad'sNationalNetwork for Educational Renewal, pilot sites across thenation aimed atreforming teacher education. But where Goodlad emphasizesteachereducation as the lever for school renewal, Lynne Millerobserves, "wesee school renewal as the lever for teacher education."<p>   Coalition Chairman Theodore Sizer agrees. "You just can'ttalk aboutteacher education apart from school reform," he declares. "Iknow I canrun a good school and train good teachers in that school.But there isno way to train good teachers without that school. Even themost superbtraining in the world won't help a person do a job that'sbeen designedso he cannot succeed, like teaching English to 150 kids aday. Theschools have got to be the pivot."<p><hr><h2>Do It in Schools</h2><hr>The Southern Maine Partnership and a similar program inJeffersonCounty, Kentucky are perhaps this country's best-articulatedexamples offull-scale integration of teacher education into the publicschools.Both the University of Louisville and the University ofSouthern Mainehave long supplied legions of beginning teachers to theirlocalities,and both institutions have recently taken similar radicalsteps tochange the structure and methods of their programs.<p>    In doing so, they have challenged many of theuniversity's mostcherished customs-notably its professorial role as theremote expertdropping in for a few brief observations in the field toassess acandidate's readiness to teach. In these programs, instead,publicschool teachers themselves may take on the status of adjunctuniversityfaculty, coaching and assessing teacher candidates over asustainedperiod and integrating preliminary methods courses into along-termhands-on experience. University faculty, for their part,find themselvesdeeply involved in the workings of schools collaboratingwith teacherteams, stimulating new ideas, mining the university'sextensiveresources, and reflecting with school people on theircurrent practice.Along the way, they learn what kind of research teachersreally coulduse from the effects of class size to the usefulness ofassessmentrubrics-and enlist the school's aid in carrying it out.<p>   When Joe Phelps decided to trade in a career managing aLouisvillefast-food restaurant for his lifelong dream of teaching highschoolhistory, for example, he turned to the University ofLouisville teachereducation program, where mid-career teaching candidates likehimself aremore common than not. But instead of sitting in universityclassroomsfor the traditional semester-long introductory courses ineducation anddevelopmental psychology, he immediately plunged into thehalls ofCoalition member Fairdale High School for a semester-longdouble-creditteam-taught course combining those subjects in the real-world context ofa 1200-student high school. Phelps was involved with highschoolstudents right from the start, working with Fairdale's YouthServicesCenter, tutoring kids who were having problems, andinteracting withparent groups.<p>   The next semester took him directly into classroomactivities,combining courses once labeled "General Methods" and"InstructionalMedia" into another new double-credit course planned andtaught with thehelp of teachers from Fairdale and nearby Iroquois High,anotherCoalition member school. As well as being in Fairdaleclassrooms two anda half days a week, Phelps and his fellow teacher edstudentschewed over their experiences with their professors forthree hourstwice a week at both schools.<p>   By his second year at the University of Louisville, whenPhelpsentered the student-teaching stage of his studies under thesupervisionof Fairdale history teacher Jackie Powell, not only had hestudied thetheoretical underpinnings of Essential schooling but he knewFairdale'spractices thoroughly enough to make substantialcontributions to histeaching team. Principal Marilyn Hohmann hired him rightaftergraduation to teach at Fairdale in the fall, and this yearJoe Phelpswill be one of three teachers on his tenth-grade teachingteam whoseUniversity of Louisville preparation matches his own.<p>   "There's absolutely no comparison between these graduatesandprevious candidates," says Hohmann emphatically. "Afterseveral years ofthis program, we now have at least four or five new teacherswho havehit the ground running-prepared for real class roomexperiences atrigorous levels and trained to put a rational, systematicemphasis onthe way kids learn. From day one they have had practice inworking withdiverse student populations in student-centered classrooms.Frankly,they can do things that are unheard of even for manyexperiencedprofessional teachers."<p>   The approach works, participants say, because it requiresteacher edstudents to be active learners right from the start. "Wehave eliminatedthe typical 'observations' you find in the 'fieldexperiences' of otherteacher ed programs," says John Fischetti, a professor ofsecondaryeducation at the University of Lousiville who, with hiscolleague BettyLou Whitford, has played a key role in its restructuring."Every visitis an involved teaching visit where they have to dosomethingmeaningful." And because a substantial cohort of teacher edstudents isat the school at any one time-about 100 students eachsemester inFairdale and Iroquois high schools combined-the studentsalso getpractical experience in classroom teamwork. "We team upbeginningteacher ed candidates," Fischetti says. "We link second-yearstudentteachers with teacher ed students in earlier-phase classes.And ofcourse all students work closely with the teaching teams atthe sites."<p><hr><h2>How Schools React</h2><hr>How does such an invasion of the university crowd feel toregularclassroom teachers trying to do their jobs? "Not only do ourfolks notresent them," says Marilyn Hohmann, "but there is a realsense ofcollegiality, respect, and shared purpose between us. We areveryinvolved in the planning stages of their program; they areverysensitive to what our needs are, and we help them designtheiractivities along those lines."<p>   Having teacher ed students to call on, say Fairdaleteachers, allowsthem to try new classroom techniques that benefit fromadditionalhelpers, such as cooperative learning or performance-basedwork. And theschool's faculty members work closely enough with universitypeople thatthey have come to see them as helpers and colleagues.Professors serveat no cost as "critical friends" to school faculty, workingon team-building and curriculum planning. They fill in for absentteam membersor model new techniques. They offer resources and trainingin unfamiliarpedagogies such as the new math standards. They help developand refinethe essential questions that focus Essential Schoolcurricula. Theycollaborate on getting grants to explore new areas ofchange. Theyobserve experienced teachers, provide them with thoughtfulfeedback,hold them to rigorous standards. They share in governancecouncils thatarticulate school goals, and they help evaluate progresstoward thosegoals at year's end. Not least, when the school's practicescome intoquestion in the community they serve as respectedspokespeople.<p>   The university's presence can also contribute to anxietyteachersalready may feel about the changes Fairdale is experiencing,Hohmannconcedes. "Some teachers do take offense when theirclassroom techniquescome under critical analysis," she says. "A new teacher withdifferentideas may either energize a team or create defensiveness."Hohmann letsevents take their course, she says, trusting that whennewcomers aretrained to support, encourage, and negotiate, their ideaswill slowlyspread. "The beautiful fact is the university's attitude isnotjudgmental or critical but facilitative," she says. "Thesepeople have avision that matches our own about teaching and learning-theybelieve wehave to change and that the university has to be a big partof thatchange."<p><hr><h2>How Universities React</h2><hr>Back at the ranch, how does all this upheaval sit withentrencheduniversity systems for which teacher education has long beenaprofitable area? Just as in schools initiating change, thetensions ofchange show up everywhere from the classroom to thegoverning council.Can new teachers learn, for instance, to cross disciplinarylines,explore essential questions, become generalists in the"knowledgeindustry," and coach young student-workers if theiruniversityprofessors (who typically lecture to their classes indiscipline-boundcourses) have not modeled that very behavior? Can acertification systemaccustomed to counting credits deal with a school changephilosophy thatquestions the very concept of a "course unit"? How will ahierarchicalpower structure cope with bottom-up change?<p>   "We've learned a lot from the teachers at our sites,"says Universityof Louisville professor John Fischetti. "We'rereconstructing our ownprogram in teacher ed at the same time we're asking teachersto do thatwith kids. We team our classes because that's where theschools aregoing and we want to practice what we preach."<p>   Knowing the university penchant for endlessly examining anew programbefore approving it, Louisville professors took a backdoorapproach whenthey first sited classes at Fairdale. "We depended onindividual facultymembers being willing to just try it," says Betty LouWhitford. Fiveyears later, half of the secondary education faculty areregularly inthe schools and the arrangement has just been formalized bytheuniversity. "If we had waited for approval we'd just bestarting now,"Whitford says. "You've got to let the trying inform theplanning and theplanning inform the trying. That orientation is notcomfortable eitherin schools or in universities-it has to do with people, notwithinstitutions. But once you experience working with teachered studentsin a real high school setting where they have real work todo, it's somuch better that you can't go back. I'm just worried aboutpulling itoff if people get really tired-it's the same issue highschool peoplewho are restructuring face."<p>   The Southern Maine Partnership began its university-schoolconnections some eight years ago by focusing not on teachereducationbut simply on shared conversations about school renewal."For five yearsteachers and university people met in elementary, middle-school, andhigh school groups to seriously discuss, as equal partners,new ideas inteaching and learning," Lynne Miller says. "The Partnershipprovided athird culture, neither university nor school, and eventuallywe startedtalking together about new forms of teacher education."<p>   Now the year-long University of Southern Maine post-baccalaureateteacher certification program (embedded in an extendedprogram that goeson to a graduate degree) sites its classes in five districtswithinstriking distance, all of which are members of the SouthernMainePartnership, which has close ties to the Coalition ofEssential Schools."We talk about university and school-based teachereducators, notuniversity faculty and public school teachers," Miller says,and theprogram's structure and pay policies reflect that attitude.<p>   "Teachers tell us that it enhances their own professionaldevelopmentto have our interns in their classrooms, engaged with themin questionsabout teaching and learning," Miller says. "The courses weoffer tointerns are also open to school faculty, so they canconvenientlyacquire credits for recertification purposes. They aretreated asprofessionals, what they know is valued, and their opinionsare takenseriously. They help make our admissions decisions; inseveral instanceswe have counseled students out of the program after schoolshave advisedus they would not make good teachers."<p>   Clashes inevitably arise, Miller asserts, when change-minded schoolpeople share this kind of power in inducting new teachers.At GorhamHigh School, one site in the ATLAS Communities partnership(includingCES, Yale's School Development Program, Harvard's ProjectZero, andEducation Development Center), secondary social studiesteacher edstudents share courses with elementary social studiesteachers, forexample, linking what they learn to high school practice byindependentstudy. "The course has to be called 'Teaching Social StudiesinElementary School' because of state certificationrequirements," Millersays. "But these people will graduate as true generalists,with dualcertification.<p>   "And what if you got rid of all that and had a 12-credit-hourinquiry-based course called 'Teaching in School'-usingwhat's generic inmethods courses, like the constructivist nature of learning,thenlearning how to apply that in math, social studies, and soforth, andonly getting specific about content where you have to?"Millerspeculates. "What if the entire teacher ed program wereorganized aroundessential questions and real problems raised by thatdistrict for thatyear? The whole program could be geared toward teachers inschool andteachers in training trying to figure out how to answerthese questions!You're not supposed to do that given the system's structuralrestraints,but that's what we're moving toward in Gorham."<p>   The more developed schools become in their thinking aboutteachingand learning, Miller observes, the more impatient they getwithuniversity structures and norms, from course requirements toassessmentmethods. "Universities don't construct things so knowledgecan happenoutside of courses," she asserts. "That doesn't ring truefor people inthe field. Teachers at schools far along in change areraising questionsthat really push the boundaries. To answer them theuniversity has tostart shedding its skin, and it's not about to do it. That'swhere thebattle is going to be."<p>   Yet these important tensions are not meant to beresolved, Millerargues, but rather managed. "You don't want to turneverything over toschools, any more than you want the university to be the wayit used tobe," she says. "But if you're really going to change youmight need, forexample, to start having courses and faculty appointmentsapproved by ajoint committee of university and school-based members,rather thanhaving complete university control the way it is now."<p>   Another key question, Betty Lou Whitford adds, is how toget schooland university cultures better linked in reflection,inquiry, andresearch. "Right now universities control the questions,"she says. "Butwho cares if we're off researching only what we'reinterested in,writing reports only other researchers read? The questionshave to ariseout of the needs of schools." Teachers play a part in this,she asserts,not only by capturing data but by using it to betterunderstand theirwork. "Last year at Iroquois High we had six or sevenmeetings of aresearch forum," she says, "generating questions like howclass sizeaffects Essential School pedagogies."<p>   Of the students who completed USM's teacher ed programlast year,portfolios of their teacherly accomplishments in hand, 96percent weresnapped up by schools clamoring for new teachers withexperience in therestructuring process. Louisville reports the samephenomenon, in astate whose education reform act has virtually codifiedEssential Schoolideas. Education schools across the country are sitting upto takenotice: programs that work directly with Coalition memberschools areunder way at Millersville University in Pennsylvania,Indiana StateUniversity in Terre Haute, Indiana University Northwest inGary, theUniversity of New Mexico, the University of Hartford inConnecticut,Florida International University, and the University of NewHampshire,among others.<p>   For programs like this to work, however, requiresidentifying andpromoting a rare species: university and school people whocaneffectively straddle the conventional boundaries betweenthese two turf-bound worlds. "If all universities were to do what theUniversity ofLouisville is doing, we could change everything at JeffersonCounty's 21high schools," declares Fairdale's Marilyn Hohmann. "Morethan anysingle external factor, the university connection has pushedus ahead inour Essential School goals. When they leave their titles andtheir pastexpectations at the door, it's a powerful relationship thatcan goanywhere."<p>   "The way I think about it, we're all in the samebusiness-not just tohelp schools, not just to educate teachers, but tocollaborate in theeducation of children," says Betty Lou Whitford. "Our goalis to blurthe lines so that it will be hard to tell whether I'm a'universityperson' or a 'school person.' I never believed it couldactually happen-but it is happening and it is amazing to watch."<p><hr><h2>Demographics, Regulation,Assessment:                   Who Teaches? How Well? How Do We Know?</h2><hr>Like many attempts to make schools better, teacher-educationreformshave been complicated by an ill-defined emphasis onaccountability-inthis case, regulating who enters into the teachingprofession and how.In an ongoing analysis, Columbia University professor LindaDarling-Hammond has explored how several intertwined issues affectavailability,assessment, and regulation of teachers.<p>   State certification of teachers varies widely, Darling-Hammond notes-not only from state to state, but according to demographicshiftsaffecting supply and demand.  One result is that teachersend up beingtreated more as tradespeople (from whose lack of trainingthe stateprotects the public) than as professionals (whose ownmembers conferlegitimacy via a recognized body of peers). Whenever demandis high andsupply short, ill-qualified candidates are allowed to fillthe need (asin the trades, where any handyman can attack yourdishwasher)--ratherthan letting salaries rise to attract new competition forpositions (asin the professions, where eye surgeons command top dollar).<p>   In teaching--unlike law, medicine, or architecture--nocommonstandards of excellence have held sway, determined by masterpractitioners themselves; no year-long supervised internshipperiod fornew teachers has been mandatory as it is in mostprofessions. Instead ofcontinually assessing teachers' demonstrated mastery of whatthey knowand are able to do, the teacher certification process hastypicallymeasured course credit hours and checklist-style "fieldexperiences."<p><hr><h2>More Teachers Look Toward Retirement</h2><hr>At the same time, demographic, cultural, and economic shifts-the babyboom, the women's movement, and the recession among them-havemarkedly affected not only how many students the nation musteducate,but who their teachers are. According to Darling-Hammond,today's publicschool teacher is typically in her early forties, with closeto 20 yearsof experience. She was senior enough to survive the layoffsof the late1970's, but now she is looking toward retirement. Despitepay increasesduring the 1980's, her real-dollar pay just barely matcheswhat it wasin 1971, and it is about 15 percent less than herexperiencedcounterpart was making in the early 1970's. And she islikely to bediscouraging to potential teachers about the satisfactionsof the job:by 1986 fully 31 percent of teachers said they would notchoose thatcareer again.<p>   The combination of large numbers of teachers retiring anda declinein the college-age population (exacerbated by a sharp dip inthose whochoose teaching) presages a looming teacher shortage,Darling-Hammond'sresearch reveals-one that has already hit cities,Southwestern states,and certain fields everywhere. This shortage is compoundedby highturnover among new teachers and complicated by field-specific shortagesthat often result in teachers leading classes outside theirfield ofpreparation. Finally, work conditions, growth opportunities,and teacherautonomy affect a school's ability to attract goodcandidates. Teachershortages in economically troubled areas are far higher thanelsewhere;the Coalition's Pasadena High School loses one third of itsteachersyearly, Santa Fe's Capital High School a quarter.<p><hr><h2>Supply and Demand: A Vicious Circle</h2><hr>When states react to such dire situations by loosening theirstandards,Darling-Hammond argues, salaries remain depressed and avicious circlebegins of ill-equipped candidates likely to drop out ofunattractiveteaching jobs. The solution is not "emergencycertification," sheasserts, but a concerted effort by teachers to seize controlof theirown profession, articulating new standards and participatingin therenewal of the teacher pool. Bottom-up school reform plays akey role inthis transformation, making the teacher's job moresatisfying andrewarding; so do higher wages and a meaningful career ladderfortalented teachers. Darling-Hammond also urges the federalgovernment toprovide incentive scholarships for highly qualified teachingstudents,and she calls on universities to ground their educationprogramssquarely in restructuring schools, providing longerinternships andmentoring periods for beginning teachers.<p>   Finally, the effort to assess teacher candidates in moreauthenticand meaningful ways has begun on several fronts. A 63-memberNationalBoard for Professional Teaching Standards was formed in1987, primarilyof classroom teachers. By 1994 that board hopes to engageschooldistricts and teachers in recognizing and rewarding thosewho candemonstrably meet its advanced standards. At the same time,theInterstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium(INTASC) hasbeen working on a comparable set of new licensing standards,with thegoal of bringing widely disparate state systems to a sharedunderstanding of what constitutes professional teaching. TheNationalCouncil for Accreditation of Teacher Education Programs hassharplyrevised its standards; and deans of the education schools inthe reform-minded Holmes Group are searching for ways to restructuretheir programs(notably, through professional development schools like theonedescribed in this issue).<p>   Any such efforts must ultimately ground themselves, justas EssentialSchool classrooms aspire to, in classroom performance thatdemonstratesreal understanding. "Reforms in teacher education ought tobe groundinglearning about teaching in a process of learning aboutlearning,"Darling-Hammond says. "Understanding that-both for theirfuture studentsand themselves-is the biggest single change in thephilosophy ofeducation.

An Atlas Community's Answer</h2><hr>At a brainstorming session in spring 1993, members of theATLAScommunity in Gorham, Maine (including faculty from theGorham schoolsand the University of Southern Maine) generated a draftdescribing whatfeatures pre-service teacher education ought to have in anATLAScommunity. What follows is excerpted and condensed from thatdescription:<p><ul><li><b>Apprenticeship model.</b>Pre-service students learn the craft of teaching byobserving practicingteachers and doing the work of teaching in real schools.<p><li><b>Adherence to the school calendar.</b>Students and professors follow the school, not theuniversity, calendar,experiencing the rhythms and schedules of the public school.<p><li><b>Essential questions, real problems.</b>Both clinical and academic work are driven by essentialquestions and:real-life problems centering on issues of learning,motivation,assessment, conflict management, and coalition building.<p><li><b>Community linkages and presentations.</b>Students are made aware of the link to the school's largercommunitythrough presentations, observations, visits anddemonstrations of theirwork to a community audience.<p><li><b>Cohort Organization.</b>Students are organized into cohort groups where they learnskills ofcollaboration, conflict management, and communication withcolleagues,avoiding the standard large-batch processing of pre-servicestudents.<p><li><b>Diversity and individualization.</b> The program honors the diversity of teacher ed students byprovidingmultiple entry and exit points, requirements keyed to theindividual,and a variety of paths to reach common ends.<p><li><b>Guided inquiry.</b>Central to the program's learning design are action researchprojects;ethnographic studies of communities, schools, and students;and studygroups around emerging issues.<p><li><b>Alternative assessments.</b>Traditional grades and evaluation systems are replaced by anongoing andcooperative evaluation system including narrativetranscripts,portfolios, demonstrations, exhibitions, and real-lifesolutions toproblems.<p><li><b> Student choice and responsibility.</b>Students and school and university educators shareresponsibility forconstructing teacher learning, including decisions aboutplacement,responsibilities, activities, and fields of inquiry.<p><li><b>Partnership faculty.</b>School teachers and community people serve as bona fidefaculty membersand decision makers about program design and implementation.<p><li><b>Ongoing teacher development.</b>Practicing teachers have time and opportunity for their ownprofessionaldevelopment as an integral part of the pre-service teachereducationprogram.<p><li><b>Time for relationship.</b>Time is allotted for building a personal and professionalrelationshipbetween student teacher, mentor teacher, and universitysupervisor.<p></ul>     (Condensed with the permission of Lynne Miller,Southern MainePartnership, Gorham, Maine.)<p><hr>               <h2> Suggested Readings/Information</h2><hr><h3>Suggested Readings</h3><ul><li>Linda Darling-Hammond et al.,<i>Model Standards for Beginning Teacher Licensing and Development:A Resource for State Dialogue,</i>developed by Interstate New Teacher Assessment and SupportConsortium.Available from Council of Chief State School Officers,One Mass Ave NW, Suite 700, Washington DC 20001-1431.Tel.: 202-336-7048.<p><li><John Goodlad et al.,<i>Teachers for Our Nation's Schools;The Moral Dimensions of Teaching; andPlaces Where Teachers Are Taught,</i>results of the Study of the Education of Educators conductedby theCenter for Educational Renewal, University of Washington,Seattle.San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1990.<p><li>Seymour B.

 <html><head><title>CES: Publications: Horace: 9-4: Integrating the Curriculum in Essential Schools</title></head><body><hr><h1><center>What's Essential? Integrating the Curriculum in Essential Schools</center></h1><hr>                                   <center>Volume 9, Number 4   <br>March 1993</center><hr>      Ask a high school class a question about something that really matters--say, whether to extend the school year through the summer, or whether Elvis just possibly could be alive, or who's going to win the championship--and watch the controversy that breaks loose. Kids you thought had been asleep for the last two months suddenly come alive, spouting evidence from the media, from their own experience, from arcane sources you never knew existed. They rip arguments and counter-arguments to shreds with the sophistication of trial attorneys; they cite precedents as shrewdly.as any politician. Hey, you think, who says kids don't use their minds?  Why can't all this energetic discourse go into schoolwork too?<p>   It can, an increasing number of educators argue.  But it will happen only if a school community decides to make it--if together its members identify the intellectual behavior they want to see in their graduates and then shape every classroom decision, every student task, and every assessment with that in mind. And if you start, as one new Essential school did, by asking "What do grown people need to know in order to do their jobs well?" you're not likely to come up with answers that fit easily into the conventional high school course of study.  Instead, you're suddenly mired in the real world, filled with all its complex connections.  You're running a public health clinic in the middle of a flu epidemic, juggling biology and economics and social science.  You're trying to decide where to put your community's toxic waste, calling on chemistry and political process and persuasive rhetoric.  You're fighting out whether to extend the school year in a tight economic climate.  All at once, distinctions between the disciplines take a back seat to the compelling questions that cannot be answered without competence in several subject areas.<p>   "If you start with the idea that kids will need to figure out complex problems on their own someday," says Paula Evans, who heads the National Re:Learning Faculty of the Coalition of Essential Schools, "you care less about discrete areas of knowledge.  You care more about kids' ability to synthesize, analyze, make solid intellectual connections.  If you decide to ASSESS them on the basis of doing that, you'll have to focus on questions around which they can practice those skills.  And once you've got those things in place--your goals, your assessment, and your essential questions--the entire curriculum should flow naturally from that point."<p>   The curriculum that achieves such an integration--one that centers more on rigorous habits of mind than on a fruitless quest for coverage in an age of information overload, and that applies those habits to content across disciplinary lines--forms the intellectual backbone of Essential school reform.  Stripping down curriculum, in fact, gave rise to the very moniker of Essential Schools, and to the Coalition's curricular motto, "Less Is More." <p>   Middle schools, closer to the younger grades where teachers commonly cross subject areas, have led the way over the last decade in shaping curriculum around themes and problems. As early adolescents try to make sense of the personal issues that absorb them, they readily engage with themes like "Living in the Future" that link their concerns to the larger world through areas like science, social studies, and health.<p>   But in high schools, which traditionally reflect the subject-area domains of universities, integrating the curriculum threatens the very structure of the school. Accustomed to the rationales of higher education-- it wasn't social scientists, after all, who landed people on the moon--many teachers balk at the thought of treading on others' intellectual turf, or losing the prestige that accompanies being a "specialist," not a "generalist." Some worry that integrated courses will not probe deeply or rigorously enough into their disciplines.  And few willingly trade the autonomy of their own course plans for some trendy and difficult notion of curriculum integration that may or may not work.<p>   Practical objections tangle the issue further at the high school level. If almost every subject plays a part in answering a question, for example, which gets the credit and who gives the grade?  When do students move on to the next class period?  What if an important subject gets short shrift in the design or execution of the project?  And when are kids going to learn the mass of gritty detail that will show up well on those all-important standardized tests?  <p>   In the face of such obstacles, though, stands undeniable classroom evidence from Coalition member schools: given a problem compelling enough to them--usually one rooted in the real world, and therefore crossing disciplinary lines--otherwise docile or unmotivated students will catch fire and start to learn.  Moved to give them all the intellectual tools they need, more and more Essential schools have begun to take small and large steps toward an integrated curriculum.  At the very least, teachers are reaching out to make explicit links among the disciplines.  At their boldest, they are reinventing the very way they approach schooling itself.<p><hr><h2>Start with the Outcomes</h2><hr>The word "curriculum" defines a course of study--ideally one that runs through students' entire schooling years, teaching them the intellectual habits valued by their school community. "It is the stuff around which school days are structured and learning is measured," writes CES senior researcher Rick Lear in his forthcoming paper, "Curriculum and Essential Schools." But too often, he observes, "curriculum is also what, when we're out of school, we remember hardly at all." Students acquire not a useful set of competencies but a random collection of facts, dissociated from each other in time and purpose and meaning.<p>   The integrated curriculum rests on the premise that mastering thinking skills, not mere information, is the object of a high school curriculum.  Perhaps at the university and postgraduate level, its advocates say, students will need to focus more narrowly on a single domain such as biological research or theoretical physics.  But high school must provide a more general education--teaching students to gather and analyze information; to speak and write clearly; to make connections between past, present, and future events; to solve problems; and to work cooperatively with other people.  Moreover, they should be able to transfer such skills between one domain and another--applying the rules of evidence as readily, say, to a court case, a scientific experiment, and a newspaper editorial.<p>   With this in mind, legislatures and state boards of education from Pennsylvania to Minnesota, Kentucky to California have begun to articulate their goals in new policies that would replace conventional Carnegie unit-counting with "exit outcomes" high school graduates must meet. Such outcome requirements appeal to several constituencies; they hold schools accountable for student success, while also granting them the freedom to meet the goals by any means they can. (Resistance comes chiefly from the religious right, which holds that inquiry is not a proper focus for young minds.)  And they apply equally to students at every ability level, asking schools to become more democratic and inclusive as the face of our student population changes.<p>   In states that have articulated such outcomes, this process takes place again on the individual schoolhouse level.  Faculties often begin a restructuring effort by reflecting on their own vision of what a graduate ought to know and be able to do.  They imagine how such mastery might be exhibited--both upon graduation and at various steps along the way--and they hash out how to assess it objectively.  Planning backwards from their final goals, they begin to take steps to instill in students the habits they expect to take hold by graduation.  The true "integrated curriculum" spans every course and lesson, in a purposeful, whole-school vision of what students should know and be able to do.<p><hr><h2>What's "Integrated"?</h2><hr>When teachers first start to look for ways to link course content to a broader context, they often refer to "integrating" their course "across disciplines."  Or they might line up "interdisciplinary" courses that explore common themes or time periods. A dizzying array of labels--from "trans-" or "cross-" or "multi-disciplinary" to "fused" or "nested" or "networked" or "webbed" curricula--makes navigating the terminology a treacherous affair.<p>   At the heart of any quarrel over what's really integrated, though, lies a genuine concern that small steps toward linking subject matter will substitute for and defuse the bigger, harder changes Essential schools require. "Once you do that linking game, it's a swamp," says Paula Evans. "We've been linking courses for 25 years already; integrating curriculum is much more complicated than that. The forces against you are so tremendous that schools won't move on to truly integrate if they start that way."<p>   Still, many Coalition member schools do begin with small and cautious gestures, preferring to establish the precedent of teachers working together before asking them to rethink their school completely.  Adopting common themes or aligning parallel courses can be done either separately or in teams, so it does not necessarily disrupt the existing schedule or system while giving students a sense that their coursework is part of a bigger picture.  One step beyond that approach actually combines the content of two or more courses--in an American Studies course, for example, linking history, literature, government, and the arts.  (This might be done either by team-teaching or by one teacher taking responsibility for the whole, thus substantially reducing the overall number of students he or she teaches.)<p>   But such efforts only dip their toes in the waters of meaningful change, Lear and Evans argue. Instead, teachers must arrive at new understandings altogether--not only about the disciplines themselves, with all their messy overlaps, but about the pedagogies and the teamwork skills that help people learn to make connections among the subject areas. Such far-reaching changes require time, support, practice, and money--the very scarce resources that make the easier path the one more traveled, even if it does not prove more effective.<p>   When teachers agree to organize the curriculum around mastering thinking skills <i>through</i> exploring substantive content, the curriculum opens into true integration. Every course, whether taught separately or teamed, might plumb its subject matter in any way that illuminates it--teaching analysis, for example, or predictive skills, or argument from evidence, or whatever the desired habits in students may be.  What will link the courses is not necessarily a time period (like the Renaissance) or a theme (like "the American Dream") but their emphasis on related concepts and techniques through every problem that comes up. Even desired behaviors--like consensus-building, or cooperative learning, or solid study habits--can form part of the "metacurriculum" that transcends subject areas.<p>   At Catalina Foothills High School in Tucson, Arizona, for example, Jen Prileson has devised a unit that divides her ninth-grade science class into groups of three or four students to run their own public health "clinics," seeing "patients" whose profiles and complaints arrive daily via a central computer. (One student directs the clinic, one is the physician, one the nurse, and one the lab technician; all see different cases, but if someone is absent the others must fill in.) Prepared by readings and a number of lab and computer activities, each group draws up disease information charts, makes diagnoses (analyzing actual slides and X-rays), recommends treatments, and keeps records on patients, who keep showing up until their problems are solved. Among other things, each clinic must write a mission statement, allocate funds for preventive care, and defend its decisions to a teacher-evaluator who drops in without notice. The grade is based on these evaluations, on how well the patients do, and on how successfully the team works together. "We had a flu epidemic moving from one area of the country to another," Prileson says. "One clinic had 48 flu patients and another nearby had only 15, because they had allocated more money for vaccines beforehand."<p>   Prileson's clinics teach plenty of biology. "The kids learned a lot more about bacteria, parasites, viruses, and disease transmission because the final event gave them a reason to learn this stuff," she says. But students also debated public health policies and costs along with important social issues, and they began to experience the links between these things. At the same time, Prileson tailors the level of problem to each student's needs, directing the most sophisticated medical scenarios to those requiring extra challenge but supplying opportunities for everyone to stretch their minds. "To be successful the kids really had to discuss content with each other," she says. "We had special ed kids making good leaps of thought while trying to figure out why a patient would come in displaying certain symptoms, or how the patient's family should handle the problem--really digging into their own experience."<p><hr><h2>The Politics of Integration</h2><hr>When the thinking skills "metacurriculum" dominates the subject-area curriculum, must a school abandon disciplinary distinctions altogether?  A number of Coalition member schools do, dividing the school day into two long blocks for "Humanities" and "Math and Science" that embrace related subjects as they explore essential questions.  But Catalina Foothills, despite being a new school with broad leeway to articulate student competency goals, encountered community resistance to that step.  Instead, the school left disciplinary lines in place, but set goals within each subject that made clear connections in thinking skills between the disciplines. Under "mathematics," for instance, one competency goal calls for students to use math to synthesize and communicate information. <p>   The political and bureaucratic realities of teaching also raise practical obstacles to the completely integrated curriculum.  Unless teams of teachers join to present a course, for example, the issue of teaching credentials might derail an interdisciplinary offering; or a teacher might not feel adequately prepared to teach outside his or her certification area. If teams are assembled, the skills to work together may not yet exist; teachers trained in solo practice need time and training to navigate those waters.  Finally, some teachers may protest that the more satisfying and challenging aspects of their content area lose out when questions skewed toward other subjects drive the curriculum. "I don't consider it challenging material," says one math teacher, "to be asked to add up survey figures and make charts in somebody's social studies project."<p>   Coalition schools wrestle with these problems in widely different ways. Some start with common planning time, but let each teacher choose the degree of emphasis on interdisciplinary areas. Sometimes a whole course is integrated across disciplines; other teachers will invite a colleague to collaborate only on a certain unit.<p>   "People tended at the start to force themselves into combining disciplines," says Anthony Conelli, a coordinator at New York City's Satellite Academy, where part of the day is blocked off for integrated courses centered on compelling questions. "We used to ask, 'How can we put a math or science component in this?'" Later, Conelli says, teachers looked instead at whatever was appropriate for having a good understanding of a particular habit or issue. Ideally, as teachers locate examples that can inspire this--rich, complex, and meaningful to the world students occupy--they both fully exploit their own area of knowledge and present issues in their broader context as well.<p>   The structure of the conventional school day and year does little to encourage the integrated curriculum.  Even to block history and English classes back-to-back across an entire grade creates major scheduling problems; so does giving teachers adequate and regular time for common planning.  To work out the details of a new course--especially one that questions the very underpinnings of the traditional curriculum--takes substantial professional development time, and the money and resources to support it.<p>   Many Coalition members serious about integrating their curricula have taken bold steps to restructure their schools to address these obstacles.  In particular, breaking a large school into smaller autonomous learning communities--often called "charter schools" or "houses"--has proved helpful. A group of perhaps 200 students and eight teachers can design a schedule that keeps the same students and teachers working together throughout the day, often simultaneously lowering the student load and encouraging teachers to integrate their courses.<p>   This differs from the problematic "school-within-a-school" concept largely in that it excludes no one; everybody within the larger school belongs to one such smaller unit. California's Piner High School has instituted two such charter schools, each with its own intellectual focus or theme; the whole school plans to adopt the new structure soon.<p>   At Pennsylvania's Bellefonte Area Senior High School, the move toward integrating the curriculum began modestly, with a double-period twice-weekly humanities course for seniors, and evolved into a more ambitious Senior Institute that will begin phasing in next year. "We're planning related thematic units that integrate science, literature and language arts, music and art, humanities and social studies," says Susan Robb, the Re:Learning coordinator for the school. "A big part of the program involves community service learning and on-the-job internships." The prospectus for the Senior Institute looks like a diagram of the ideal integrated curriculum's links between skills and content.  Starting by listing "essential skills" (such as "justify two sides of an issue") as goals, it poses the question "How do we learn?", then explores the "learning processes" (experience, discovery, reflection, and communication) through four broad subject areas.<p><hr><h2>Assessing Student Performance</h2><hr>All areas of Bellefonte's Senior Institute diagram point to the culminating "performance assessment"--and assessment is the prime mover, Coalition people argue, of the true integrated curriculum. "The point of integrating curriculum is not for its own sake," argues Paula Evans. "It must serve the larger scheme of things--the school's fundamental goals and how it is going to assess them." The final performance, then, is not the natural and authentic <i>extension</i> of the course; rather it is the other way around.<p>   Does a school want its graduates to understand how political conflicts emerge and how they can be resolved?  Then require a graduating forum in which students demonstrate that understanding--say, by analyzing the current situation in Somalia and the U.S. troop presence there. To prepare for that requirement, a junior history course could mine the Civil War era for insights into conflict resolution, asking students continually to practice transferring those insights into new situations.<p>   Every curricular decision, the Coalition argues, should flow from such concrete visions of what a school's graduates should know and be able to do. If ultimately students must explain a concept to another person, must give it voice in a new way (through an artistic performance, for instance), must make comparisons and analogies across subject areas, must solve a new problem using its principles, they will need to practice these skills in every course and be tested on them continually from their first weeks in high school.<p>   Such "performance assessments" are not easily quantified; they require a disconcerting, sometimes messy system of portfolios and other anecdotal measurements that makes comparison difficult and disrupts the status quo.  Coming up with a test that truly measures understanding across subject areas is especially hard for high school teachers used to directing coursework toward standard subject-area achievement tests. Increasingly, though, subject-area associations are pushing for more integrated assessment tools.  The "new math standards" of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics call for real-life applications and transfer of knowledge across boundaries; and Project 2061 of the American Association for the Advancement of Science seeks to integrate math, science, and technology instruction in similar ways. Even the Educational Testing Service's standardized tests have begun asking students to make links and integrate content and skills mastery. (Students don't seem to suffer from integrated curricula even according to old-style criteria; over 80 normative or comparative studies show they perform as well or better on standardized tests, according to the National Association for Core Curriculum.)<p>   When coursework is assessed, problems like the examples presented in this issue prove to challenge students at every achievement level. "A student without a sophisticated math background can contribute to solving these same problems alongside a more advanced student, but through a different avenue," says CES National Re:Learning Faculty member Jude Pelchat. "Likewise, some projects provide a window for sophisticated math that mightnot otherwise be included in the curriculum."<p>   If the criteria for performance assessments are clear, they should honor each student's learning style and type of intelligence while pushing each to meet high thinking standards. Just as planning sessions for integrated curriculum begin by envisioning what graduates should be like, the best course planning sessions seek out a significant and complex demonstration for course's end--one that requires continual practice of the desired thinking skills but can accommodate different back-grounds and individual strengths.<p><hr><h2>The Evolving Curriculum</h2><hr>The integrated curriculum, clearly, does not spring fully grown from the head of a planning committee. "You need discussions about how to work together, how to resolve problems, who's assuming what responsibilities within the group," says Anthony Conelli, who is writing a doctoral dissertation on the process of integrating the curriculum. "And you need to continually return to the question of why you're doing this topic--what your goal is, and how each part plays into that goal. Don't assume anything."<p>   The task requires, in fact, that teachers question the most fundamental assumptions of their trade--replacing the emphasis on coverage with much more ambitious goals,  establishing new norms of scholarship and performance, and retooling the entire structure of school to make that possible.  Involving the entire school community in that herculean effort may be the critical factor in Essential schools' success--a final, difficult, and public "performance assessment" for school people that will demand every ounce of their political and intellectual courage.<p>   "What keeps us alive in our third year of trying this," says Natalie Hiller, co-coordinator of an integrated charter school within Philadelphia's inner-city Simon Gratz High School, "is that we've seen the difference start to happen.  As resistant as kids were when we started out, that's how ecstatic they are in the end. 'We never knew we were capable of doing this kind of work,' they tell us, 'and now we know.' We hang onto that and push our agenda, clamoring for places to burst through." <p><hr>            <h2>What Should Students Know and Be Able to Do? <br>                           One School' s Requirements</h2><hr>Before graduating from Catalina Foothills High School in Tucson, Arizona students will have to synthesize and personalize their achievement in three broad areas. They must demonstrate their depth of understanding and knowledge, and the ability to apply skills to projects of their own design that make connections among the disciplines.<p>                 <h3>          GRADUATION COMPETENCIES</h3><b>1. APPLICATION OF SYSTEMS THINKING TO CURRENT PROBLEMS. </b>Drawing on their subject area experiences for problems that may or may not cross disciplinary lines (an environmental problem, say, or an artistic creation), students use diverse material and resources (including technology) to analyze the problem, its context, and aspects of its interdependence from many perspectives. They must project possible outcomes for the problem based on their research, and then justify their choice of the optimum response. Their final presentation must also incorporate reflection on the process of working through the problem. <i>Example:</i> A careful analysis of the current situation in Somalia.<p><b>2. PERSONAL CHALLENGE.</b> Students will demonstrate a sustained, intensive effort to achieve a personally established and significant goal (academic, personal, or physical). They present a log of their efforts and assess their own challenges, efforts, and outcomes. <i>Example</i>: A student of German extraction learns the language (not taught at the school) and investigates her family history.<p><b>3. MAKING CONNECTIONS.</b> Working in teams, students select concepts that interest them from different areas of study, analyze them, and search for logical connections between them. Their presentation should persuade an audience of the value of the connections, and also analyze the interdependence of the team effort. <i>Example</i>: Take the musical problems in a jazz composition and relate them to the historical development of the jazz form.<p>                              <h3>SUBJECT COMPETENCIES</h3>To graduate, students must also demonstrate competency in the individual subject areas listed below. The school' s handout elaborates on each requirement and delineates specific assessment criteria for each.  (For example, the first listing under science adds, "Students will be assessed on their ability to apply key information and concepts to various situations, analyze cause and effect, and communicate these findings.")<p><b>SCIENCE</b><p><ul><li>Conceptual and systemic understanding of the human organism<li>Conceptual understanding of principles and theories of energy<li>Expertise in a specialized field of science<li>Science, technology, and society<li>Science skills<li>Experimental design</ul><p><b>PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH</b><p><ul><li>Critical health issues<li>Personalized fitness plan<li>Individual and team activities</ul><p><b>MATHEMATICS</b><p><li>Mathematical procedures<li>Conceptual understanding of math content <li>Use of mathematics to synthesize and communicate information<li>Recognition or creation of multiple representations of mathematical ideas<li>Problem-solving<li>Value and awareness of how mathematics brings order to our world</ul><p><b>THE ARTS</b><p><ul><li>Artistic analysis, <i>or</i><li>Performance and reflective evaluation, <i>or</i><li>Original work</ul><p><b>HISTORY AND SOCIAL STUDIES</b><p><ul><li>Historical investigation<li>Analysis of current issues<li>Translating understanding into service or action<li>Cultural analysis<li>Synthesis of self<li>Functional citizenship literacy</ul><p><b>ENGLISH</b><p><ul><li>Use of oral language in group tasks<li>Personal response to literature<li>Analysis of literature<li>Reading enrichment<li>Narrative and expository writing<li>Academic writing<li>Workplace writing<li>Oral presentation</ul><p><b>FOREIGN LANGUAGE</b><p><ul><li>Intermediate-level reading, writing, speaking, and listening in commonly taught languages, <i>or</i><li>Novice-level skills in less commonly taught languages</ul><p><b>COMPUTER LITERACY AND INFORMATION LITERACY</b><p><ul><li>Technological literacy<li>Information literacy</ul><p><hr>      <h2>The Study of Markets Links English and Social Studies</h2><hr>Rochester' s School Without Walls offers a course that centers on the impact of rapidly emerging markets on people' s lives. Since resources are limited and wants are unlimited, the course description asks, how does scarcity drive choices and tradeoffs? How, why, when, and where are markets created, demand and supply regulated, and economic and social costs considered? How do international markets affect us and others? Students create a viable market project and present independent research reports.  The course integrates mathematical concepts, geography, and the study of other cultures; classic readings across the disciplines include <i>The Wealth of Nations, The Grapes of Wrath, The Jungle, Life in a Turkish Village, Silent Spring, The Zero Sum Society, Animal Farm, and The Hidden Persuaders.</i>  Other sources include newspapers and periodicals, interviews and field trips to museums and other community sites, internships, and guest speakers.<p><hr>          <h2>Students As Scientists:                Curriculum That Collaborates With The Community</h2><hr>All through a cold December night last year two high school students from Santa Rosa, California set traps for rodents in a 365-acre marine reserve over 20 miles from their homes.  As part of their science class at Piner High School, they were collecting data for a project on feral cat activity, working not only with their regular science teacher but with a mentor from the University of California' s Bodega Marine Laboratory.<p>   The course is part of an innovative three-year program called "The Science School," offering accelerated and specialized instruction in science, math, technology, English, and social studies to some 150 students at this 1500-student Coalition member school. To personalize its curriculum, Piner is organizing itself into several such "learning communities," each with its own integrated curricular focus and each with the freedom to structure its own time and resources.  The Science School curriculum centers around local community problems and resources, requiring each student to complete a year-long project as part of a research team mentored by area science professionals.<p>   The projects grow out of the mentor professionals'  own needs, ranging from a team that monitors the water chemistry and biology of the city' s urban streams to a sports medicine group exploring anatomy and physiology through kinesiology and conditioning. Many carry college credit at the University of California. Mentors are usually paid by their own employers as a donation to the school, and most put in many extra hours of their own time.<p>   These are demanding, honors-level courses in a school not previously known for academic excellence; they require a level of commitment from students and their parents that would be unusual in any high school. Field research for the feral cat project, for example, entails regular 50-mile round trips to the research site and physically demanding, often tedious outdoor work. Students must work comfortably with adults and up to ten other students, and because they are part of a professional research project they must be precise, meticulous, self-motivated, and responsible in its execution.<p>   Each student maintains an ongoing portfolio of the progress of her work, complete with abstracts, evidence, and analysis of group and individual work. "I hope some day [the work we do on the Bodega Marine Reserve feral cats] to be as good as publishable," one student researcher wrote in her final report, "and believe me, I am going to try my hardest."<p><hr>            <h2>Linking High School Science and Humanities:                                A Four-Year Plan</h2><hr>At Oceana High School in Pacifica, California, ninth and tenth graders all take a two-year required science program linking major concepts in physics, chemistry, earth science, and life science, and corresponding with the school' s humanities curricula. "Patterns of Evolution and Change," the first-year science course, connects with Humanities curriculum for the same year: "Patterns of Cultures." In the second year "Science through All Time," connects with the humanities theme, "How Do People Govern Themselves?"<p>   In their third year, Oceana students investigate scientific principles in physics, chemistry, earth science and life science, asking the unifying question, "How has the scientific community contributed to the American dream?" At the same time their humanities course explores the American dream through political and social history and literature. Finally, in the fourth year the theme of "Power and the Good Life" links both science and humanities curricula, and students who have shown a consistent interest in science and math may focus on specialized areas of research and investigation.<p>   At each level, Oceana has articulated specific objectives of which students must demonstrate mastery by the time they complete the course.  These include traditional scientific skills: laboratory methods, measurements, the recording of scientific data, and the like.  But other, less traditional objectives are also listed: they must be able to communicate scientific knowledge clearly in writing and speaking, for instance; they must be aware of ethical issues in science and technology; they must be able to evaluate the methods used in a scientific research study and the accuracy and sources of error in its conclusions.  And sprinkled among the objectives are surprisingly concrete and everyday goals: students must make an invention, explain how an airplane and a photocopy machine work, use a computer spreadsheet. All along, the objectives themselves blur the lines between the disciplines; one of the fourth-year science objectives requires students to understand how governments use technology to become powerful and maintain or restore power and order.<p><hr>                         <h2>Meadows or Malls?                   Applying Math Skills to Community Problems</h2><hr>How should River City use three pieces of newly acquired land: a closed-down military base, a 300-acre farm, and a mine? Residents are split between development and recreational advocates--and their final choices must minimize costs to the city. Students at Boston' s Fenway Middle College, a CES member school, will soon be working out the answers as they learn to combine mathematics with governmental know-how.<p>   The pilot Interactive Mathematics Program, developed at the University of California' s Lawrence Hall of Science and San Francisco State University, poses just such open-ended problems in a high school curriculum with regional centers in three states. Funded by the National Science Foundation, it aims to replace the traditional year-by-year progression (algebra-geometry-algebra 2-trig-precalculus) with one that uses substantial, complex applications to emphasize concepts and connections among these branches.<p>   The "meadows or malls" dilemma, for instance, can be expressed using a system of linear inequalities, which lends itself to a solution by means of linear programming (a topic introduced in the second-year curriculum). A key step is to find various points of intersection of the graphs of corresponding equations, which in turn leads to the need to solve systems of linear equations.  To solve the problem, students use inexpensive graphing calculators, which allow a stronger intuitive understanding of how the linear programming model works. Along the way they must also wrestle with the dilemmas governments face as they calculate the costs and benefits of improving the land for various kinds of use.<p>   IMP aims to broaden the scope of who takes challenging math courses, expand and enrich their content, and replace traditional pedagogy with investigations, projects, and new technology.  IMP' s goal is to teach students to use mathematics in a meaningful context and to assess them on that basis.<p><hr>                       <h2> "Whose America Is It?"</h2><hr>At Fenway Middle College, a Boston alternative high school, the humanities course "Whose America Is It?" explores American society from pre-Columbian North America to the present from the point of view of the common person, using sources and approaches from history, literature, sociology, psychology, political science, and the fine arts. Students probe three periods--the discovery of America; the Industrial Revolution, and the Great Depression--to relate their challenges and struggles to the problems contemporary America faces. Sample questions for presentations include:<p><ul><li>Use microfilmed pages of the New York Times stock index to follow the stock of three actual companies through 1929-30. Using several graphs and charts, explain their growth or decline.  Be prepared to explain how the stock market functions, and how or whether its collapse "caused" the Great Depression.<li>Is territoriality an instinctive or a learned behavior?  Support with specific examples from history, our readings, and your own experience.<li>Explain the differences between two Native American tribes with respect to their systems of government, legal structures, religious practices, relations with other tribes, ideas about property and gender roles.<li>With drawings, diagrams, or photos, compare the principles of steam power versus water power.  Which are more effective in given situations?  Which can do more work?  What are the limitations of each?<li>Using drawing and diagrams, explain the scientific principles that allowed a particular invention or a scientific innovation to "revolutionize" an industry.  Then be prepared to discuss the effects of that invention on how or where people lived, worked, shopped, etc.<li>Draw on scientific resources to explain what farming practices contributed to the "Dustbowl," and how might that have been prevented.  Which plants can grow in such dry soil, and what biological characteristics allow this?  How can such considerations be of use today?</ul><p><hr>           <h2>For More Information on Integrated Curriculum</h2><hr>James Beane, <i>Affect in the Curriculum: Toward Democracy, Dignity, and Diversity.</i>   New York: Teachers College Press, 1990.

Advancedphysics and calculus students at one Essential school are asked to show theyknow, in a week-long assignment their teachers devised together. Take onecultural phenomenon, they are told --from Freudian psychology to atonal music,American constitutional law to Dadaist art --and demonstrate how it isinfluenced by one theory of physics or the other. Then, in a mind-boggling leapof imaginative reasoning, attempt to describe how that same phenomenon <i>would</i>look --if the tables were turned.<p>   The assignment is an apt metaphor for what is going on just now in Essentialschool mathematics and science classrooms around the country. Accustomed to anolder paradigm that once fit our educational capabilities and aspirations,teachers are being asked to make a quantum leap into the information age toimagine something they have never seen, to define their home territory in waysaltogether new.<p>   No more can they prepare a few elite students to probe the frontiers ofscience and math, and teach the rest the arithmetical basics that will get themthrough a less ambitious life. Problem-solving and mathematical reasoning havebecome the lingua franca of our time, their skills fundamental to plumber andphysicist alike. If our society is to survive and compete, our children mustlearn to ply these tools together, speaking a searching new language that isalien to the generation before.<p>   The challenge alternately infuriates and exhilarates, terrifies andfrustrates teachers trained in the certainties of another era and gripped by ahigh school structure that has long valued a linear progression throughcompartmentalized sub-disciplines of science and math. Algebra, geometry,trigonometry, pre-calculus march on in a progression dictated by universityadmissions requirements set down long ago and followed by virtually no othermodern nation. Earth science, biology, chemistry, and physics make up a layer-cake of facts compressed into year-long sequences. But if we integrate thesesubjects into each other, teachers worry, will we not turn the curriculumcompletely upside down, make the standard national assessments meaningless, dragdown the most able students and put the others at risk of learning nothing atall?<p>   And yet it is beginning to happen. Scientific and mathematical organizationsfrom the American Association for the Advancement of Science to the NationalCouncil of Teachers of Mathematics have put their weight behind an urgent callfor change in the way their disciplines are taught. From Connecticut toCalifornia, state education offices are listening, alarmed at the statisticsthat show American students far behind their international counterparts. Goadedby large-scale state adoption prospects, textbook publishers are slowly changingtheir tunes. And in Essential school classrooms, by ones and twos, teachers arestarting to ask students for a new kind of thinking altogether.<p><hr><h2>The Calls for Change</h2><hr>What is at stake is the very meat and potatoes of high school pedagogy --aprogression of courses driven by a limited content that can be covered in ayear-long course. In the industrial era of the first half of this century, sucha view made a certain amount of sense. But as scientific and technologicalknowledge approaches the point where it doubles every 20 months, transmitting"the facts" in high school classes becomes impossible, and textbook exercisesthat ask students to repeat information are useless. Instead, teachers must findways to get students to USE information, calling on everything from computers toesthetic theory to address fundamental problems in every discipline.<p>   These are the main points made by the organizations which, with varyingemphases and approaches, are pushing math and science teachers to change theirteaching methods and course content. The chief difference between our system andthose of countries whose students perform better, these critics argue, is thatwe do not expect our students to master difficult material from the start.Instead, we sort and select them into tracked math and science curricula at suchan early age that by the time they reach high school, only the top ten percentof students are even exposed to mathematical and scientific problem-solving.<p>   Math is a language, the argument goes, in which we describe the world andsolve its problems. ("I think of math as one of the humanities," mathematicianand educator Stephen Willoughby says. "Plato would have his philosopher-kingstudy it for 20 years before beginning philosophy.") But most students --especially minorities and females --are not expected to learn to speak thislanguage, which is the gatekeeper to economic and political power in oursociety. Fully 75 percent of all jobs, reports the National Research Council,require proficiency in simple algebra and geometry. Yet three out of four highschool graduates leave school unable to satisfy either college or jobmathematical requirements, and the picture for science is just as bleak.<p>   With this in mind, several top-level groups of scholars and teachers areworking on alternatives to promote math and science literacy for all studentsand in every grade. Top among the forces for change right now are:<p><ul><li>The new <b>CURRICULUM AND EVALUATION STANDARDS</b> of the National Council ofTeachers of Mathematics (NCTM), which focus on mathematical problem-solving,communication, reasoning, and connections and relationships with the outsideworld. Students' mathematical literacy and power will increase, the NCTM says,when we pose them genuine and meaningful problems for which they can constructmathematical solutions. Designed by an extraordinary consensus of teachers anduniversity scholars, the standards are accompanied by a steady flow of teachingaids and examples, including assessment rubrics.<p><li> <b>PROJECT 2061</b>, a long-term Curricular reform effort of the American Associationfor the Advancement of Science (AAAS), focusing on educational reforms in math,science, and technology. Named after the year Halley's Comet will next return toEarth, the project emphasizes common themes across disciplines and mastery ofconcepts over data. Its manifesto is a 100-page book called <i>Science for AllAmericans</i>, and its work is supported by a broad base of private and governmentalfunds. The first classroom-tested materials are expected in 1993.<p><li> The <b>SCOPE, SEQUENCE, AND COORDINATION (SSC)</b> project of the National ScienceTeachers Association (NSTA), which aims to cut through the layer-cake curriculumby combining life sciences with physical sciences in thematic study units forgrades 7 through 12. The project calls for fewer topics with more practical,activity-based applications and personal relevance to students, andheterogeneously grouped classes where students move from concrete experiencetoward abstract concepts, with less focus on memorizing facts. SSC is beingtried in several states including California, where experimental stateassessments are already using it as their basis.<p><li>The <b>MATH AND SCIENCE FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS</b>, which delineatesnew expectations in curricular content and instructional strategies for gradesK-12. Because one out of seven U.S. students goes to school in California, itspolicies drive textbook publishers to reflect new ways, and eventually show upon state standardized tests that are used by other states as well.<p></ul><hr><h2>The Implications for Teachers</h2><hr>All these new standards --interdisciplinary connections, depth over coverage,students as active learners, teachers as guides, the expectation that allstudents can learn --have much in common with the Common Principles thatCoalition member schools already embrace. Essential school teachers are familiarwith the idea of the teacher as generalist and learner, who coaches studentsalong new paths rather than delivering information to them. But is it actuallyeasier for them to take up the challenge and make new practice happen in theirschools?<p>   The answer, it seems, is a qualified no. Though Essential school teachers mayhave a head start on the concepts involved, the new standards threaten thereality of most schools at their very foundations. In math and science more thanin any other academic areas, Coalition teachers, like their colleagueselsewhere, must confront an array of internal and external obstacles to changingthe way they teach.<p>   The generalist-teacher must still, after all, submit her students to thestandardized tests and college admissions officers of 1991. Her colleagues stillexpect certain chapters to be covered before students are passed their way, andher students (and their parents) still expect her to dispense answers crisplyfrom the front of the class. The school schedule may not give her students timeto flounder along the messy paths of critical discourse. Most important, thetime and resources to try out and reflect on new teaching practices (to saynothing of new scientific frontiers) may be almost entirely denied to theteacher facing this enormous challenge.<p>   Little wonder that, at the 1991 Fall Forum of the Coalition of EssentialSchools, the tension in a packed workshop of math and science teachers was thickenough to slice. "You just can't teach math well without ability tracking," oneteacher said emphatically. "You're dragging down the most able kids, and theothers can't succeed. And where's the research to prove that it even works?" Ascience teacher spoke up: "Student-as-worker has always been part of scienceclasses. What's so different about this? We're already doing it." "I have tocover certain material to make sure my kids meet state curriculum requirementsand do well on the AP tests," argued another.<p>   Other teachers question whether interdisciplinary units have been designed tomake sure that the problems they pose are equally challenging in all areas. "Theteam picks some interesting problem from the social sciences," one math teachersaid, "and the math part of it turns out to be completely trivial. If I'm goingto do this, I want something that really challenges my students and shows themhow important math is in the real world." One way to frame this is to ask whichdiscipline drives the study of which, an area where some teachers feelconsistently shortchanged. Finally, math and science teachers are challengingthe assumption that when long blocks are assigned for interdisciplinary study,their two subject areas must always be linked. "Why not math and music or art?"one teacher asked me. "Why not biology and social studies? It's as if everythingthe humanities jocks don't feel comfortable with has got to be put in one cornerof the curriculum."<p><hr><h2>A Changing Pedagogy</h2><hr>Despite such confusion and resentment, however, when these teachers begin totalk about their own goals for their students, a surprising consensus begins toemerge. "What do you want your students to retain from your class ten years fromnow?" CES consultant Amy Gerstein asked the Forum group. From "criticalthinking" and "creative problem-solving" to "how to ask questions" to "inductiveand deductive reasoning," from "seeing patterns and connections" to "applicationof skills," the answers made a near-perfect match with the new nationalstandards in both disciplines.<p>   Given this, the problem becomes to shape courses, teaching strategies, andassessment methods so that they work toward those shared goals. Essential schoolteachers are struggling with this complex task in their own practice, and aswith all authentic change, it is a slow process. In order to effectively turntheir focus, they must not only alter the assignments they give but also the waythey present material, and even the very way they think about it.<p>   All the closely paced, teacher-controlled exercises of the "clinicalteaching" method they were once urged to adopt are suddenly out of favor.Instead, they are asked to probe wrong answers for their reasoning, to get kidsspeculating in small groups about strategies, to think of knowledge as somethingthat must be constructed from the student's own experience.<p>   The results are necessarily rough at the start, with teachers often mixingold ways and new as they adjust to changing expectations. "In the middle ofdoing something differently I find myself worrying I'm falling behind otherteachers," says Cheri Dedmon, a CES National Faculty member who teaches math atTennessee's Hixson High School. "It's always in the back of my mind when I'mletting the kids have the time they need to think things through. I want to justgive 'em what they need and get on with it."<p>   Worse, Dedmon says, her students want that, too. "The brighter kids are oftenthe hardest to get to change - they're as resistant as veteran teachers who havebeen working the same way for 30 years," she says. "They want to ace their dittosheets, not to be pushed to think; and if there's a problem they want Mom andDad to step in and solve it for them, not worry it through themselves. Ifthere's one goal I have for their thinking habits, it's to break them of that."<p><hr><h2>How to Do It?</h2><hr>Strategies to break through the old expectations must include ways to link mathand science problems to things students care about already, teachers agree.These can include projects in the community, societal or artistic dilemmas theymight face in which mathematical or scientific reasoning plays a part, or evengames or puzzles.<p>   Bruce Shotland's students at Thayer High School in Winchester, New Hampshire,for instance, keep ongoing records of local water quality from year to year,which helped block a toxic waste dump slated for the area some years ago. Theyare now embarked on a "genetic thumbprint" of their rural community, aninterdisciplinary project made possible by Thayer's teaming of each grade'steachers in a long-block schedule.<p>   At Louisville's Eastern High School, science teacher Gil Downs, who is a CESNational Faculty member, will team this term with a math, a social studies, andan English teacher on a four- to six-week unit called "Order Out of Disorder"developed at a summer institute at Brown University. "We are working with agroup of sophomores who move together, the same kids I have in first-yearchemistry," he says. "Instead of four final exhibitions, they'll work togetheron the same one."<p>   This interdisciplinary emphasis is the only way that math and science canmove past a preoccupation with acquiring discrete skills and into a focus onsolving real-life problems, says Herb Rosenfeld, a cofounder of New York'sCentral Park East Secondary School and a veteran math and science teacher whoconsults for the Coalition. "The curriculum has to be based on major strands,such as Counting, Measuring, and Location, instead of on contrived sequences,"he says. "You may have to go from the real world to the world of letters, useequations together with techniques of counting."<p>   Real-life problems, of course, can include sophisticated applications toother mathematical or scientific topics. By learning to think abstractly, forexample, students can reach conclusions that might escape them if they arelimited to their own physical senses. Or by using deductive proofs, students canconstruct mathematical models of hypothetical situations - in medicine or outerspace, for instance --so as to predict what will happen in advance.<p>   To insist on relating learning to students' own experience is not to say thatclassical thought has no part in the math and science curriculum. Indeed, atChicago's Sullivan High School math and science teachers routinely use seminardiscussions of texts from Aristotle, Galileo, and Newton as well ascontemporaries like Isaac Asimov and Richard Feynmann to prod their students'thinking on critical issues those disciplines face.<p>   "The paradox is that we must convince our students of the universality of thelaws of nature," says science teacher Nancy Shlack, "and at the same timeencourage them to leave room for doubt and the possibility of reshaping theselaws as new information becomes available." Lectures and labs can go only so farin this task, Shlack says; by forcing a student to defend and explain his or heremerging understanding, the seminar provides the necessary third step.<p>   In each one of these teaching strategies, says Stephen Willoughby, aprofessor at the University of Arizona and author of <i>Mathematics Education for aChanging World</i>, we must not limit students to textbook exercises like formalderivations of proof. Rather, students should investigate and identify their ownproblems and theorems, then test their conjectures in absence of an authoritywho will say whether the conjecture is true or false. Finally, they must learnto define their audience and give that audience a convincing argument. Only asthey learn to use math as a language with which to communicate with each otherabout common problems will they begin to acquire for themselves the real powerof these disciplines. With this in mind, many math and science teachers usejournals as a regular way of prompting students to reflect on their work.<p><hr><h2>What About Ability Grouping?</h2><hr>Clearly, cooperative learning is implicit in all the new ways of approachingmath and science. "Whether you're talking about cooking or research, one's bestwork usually takes place in a group," says Stephen Willoughby. But how can onecombine students of vastly different abilities in problem-solving situationswithout holding back the best students and defeating the less able?<p>   One answer, it seems, is to combine ability levels from an early enough agethat all kids are exposed to the same concepts from year to year. More ablestudents should take group projects to deeper levels than others will attempt,but they will share the same basic conceptual problems. Kids who don't get theconcept in one way can be coached to understand it in another, and provided withwhatever support they require.<p>   "The way course material is currently organized, teachers think you can'tmove ahead if you once get stuck at a certain point," complains Herb Rosenfeld."In fact, learning is much more open-ended --there are always many routes youcan take to solve a problem. If a kid at Central Park East has some particularlearning deficit --say he can't multiply --we don't exclude him from tacklingsomething. We just let him use a calculator. There's no clear evidence thatthese kids are not capable of more sophisticated thinking. In fact, in somecases they are <i>more</i> capable of it."<p>   The point, math educators say, is not whether calculators should be used butwhen. If students acquire a basic number sense so they can judge whether ananswer is reasonable, and if they master elementary number facts in a base tensystem, they will learn to judge when calculators are a useful problem-solvingtool. Computers, likewise, should not be a substitute for active andexperiential learning but a stimulus to it.<p>   To get to the point where mixed ability groups work well, though, requiresmajor changes in the entire curriculum from the start --one reason thatCalifornia's frameworks are aimed at kindergarten through grade 12. Whenstudents who have not been given the same conceptual training are suddenlygrouped in a mixed ability class, teachers feel the pinch. "It can be difficultto get all students to do good authentic work when they do not have thebackground to do the problem," argues math teacher Gloria Campion of St. Louis'sParkway South High School. "How can I grade all these students fairly in thesame class?"<p>   So far, Campion says, she has varied her assessments to judge students notonly on computational skills but on group work, oral presentations, and problem-solving strategies. "Every class has students who can shine in one area oranother," she says. "A student can be brilliant at getting to the heart of aproblem, understanding what needs to be done, and explaining it. But he may notbe able to reach the bottom line. That student can get an A from me, because Iput a lot of emphasis on analyzing and communicating the structure of a problem--the very last part is to do it."<p>   Hixson High School's Cheri Dedmon pairs students of different abilities on"partner tests," where students' scratchwork must show they both did eachproblem before either will get credit for it. "Kids are less reluctant to askeach other, 'How did you get that?'" she says. Like Herb Rosenfeld, Dedmonopposes holding kids back to lower-level tasks because they have not masteredcertain skills. "Some things in trigonometry these kids could do," she says. "Atsome point you have to give them a calculator and say 'go with it.' We get sohung up on arithmetic that some kids never get pushed to looking at what'sexciting and motivating in math."<p><hr><h2>Teachers Learning New Ways</h2><hr>Without exception the schools where math and science teachers are mostsuccessful at using new approaches are those with ample professional developmentopportunities. McCaskey High School, a large urban school in Lancaster,Pennsylvania, has just made a major leap toward an integrated thematiccurriculum with a tenth-grade team of science, math, language arts, and historyteachers. "We had sixteen people working on writing this curriculum for ninefull days during the last school year," says curriculum director Dan McGary."Our district has a staff development center where twelve to sixteen teachers gofor six days of workshops four times a year to work on whatever seems needed.Next week we're bringing in sixteen more teachers to start teaming."<p>   In Delaware, which like Pennsylvania is part of the Re:Learning initiative ofCES and the Education Commission of the States, opportunities abound forteachers to explore new methods. Supported by the National Science Foundation'srestructuring initiative, the state is focusing on improving math, science, andtechnical education, and six schools in Re:Learning are involved in a major NSFgrant for that purpose. At Middletown High School, a grant from Kraft-GeneralFoods funds a summer high school demonstration session for developinginterdisciplinary courses, linked with a University of Delaware educationcourse. Over the last two summers, eight Middletown math and science teachershave taken away new ideas to spark change in their school's curriculum.<p>   At Broadmoor Junior High School in Pekin, Illinois, Stacy Garman moved intoscience teaching from another discipline altogether, teaming with a seventh-grade math teacher to plan a unit on problem solving and the scientific method."We mapped out our plan over the summer, using discretionary funds from ourteam," Garman says. "Now we've just asked for two more days because we need tosit down for more sustained planning time."<p>   Herb Rosenfeld is emphatic about the need for math and science teachers tomeet in continuing professional study groups if they are to revise theirpractice. "We must broaden teachers' base of knowledge so they can see thatchoices are there to make," he argues. "They should be meeting monthly with agroup of other teachers, including university mathematicians, who can identifyprovocative literature to read. Then they can take that material and start toshape a new curriculum." Rosenfeld hopes that the Coalition will soon sponsorsuch efforts around the country, and is seeking modest funding to support it.<p>                                 A more ambitious turn could hardly be envisioned than the one now brewing inmath and science departments across the country. Because it will require suchfundamental shifts at every level, only a sustained and focused long-term effortholds any hope of real progress. But if any teachers are to succeed at this seachange across the disciplines, those in Essential schools may have a betterchance than most. They have already begun to see, after all, how curricular andpedagogical change shakes every aspect of a school's structure. They knowexactly how hard it is to move away from the front of the class into the coach'ssideline spot, urging their students to discover new things for themselves. Asthe 21st century bears down, a revolution of knowledge will force students tofunction in a world we can as yet barely contemplate, and schools will have tohelp.<p>   "It's scary when you ask a class of high-achieving students to think and youget utter silence," says Gloria Campion. "They're still as hooked into the oldsystem as we are, waiting for us to turn cartwheels and do it for them. In anideal world I'd like sequential course constraints lifted. I personally haven'tyet come to grips with the balance of problem solving and other skills. Andassessment needs to be totally changed, though I'm not ready to say at advancedlevels that just doing any project is enough. We've got to teach them enough sothat the culmination of the course would be to construct something that usessophisticated skills --you design the heating of the airport hangar, you designthe cooling, you design the roof, put it all together. In a very traditionalschool and community, I don't see it happening soon. But we're going in thatdirection."<p><hr>                       <h2>Some Ways Math And Science Are Used</h2><hr><ul><li>To reapportion Congressional districts, using Huntington's method of leastproportions. A useful social studies project could be to figure out how yourstate could be gerrymandered to benefit either Republicans or Democrats, givenits voting habits, and how to apportion districts without gerrymandering.<p><li>To investigate when the number of telephone area codes in the United Stateswill run out, given the increasing number of uses for telephone lines,unanticipated at the time the system was designed. What are the alternatives thephone companies face?<p><li>To figure out how much it cost to put out the oil fires in Kuwait. (Why werethe original estimates so far off?) Involves chemistry, labor economics, mathskills of estimation, size and scale, measure.<p><li>To analyze statistically the frequency of letters in any document written inEnglish, for the purpose of breaking various codes. (The same is possible inother languages, but frequencies differ from language to language.)<p><li> In esthetics, to determine what proportions are pleasing to the human eye. The"golden section" is the result of dividing a line of length q into two lengths,r and s, so that the ratio of q to r is the same as the ratio of r to s. Asimple mathematical derivation involving the quadratic formula can be used toshow that the ratio of r to s is about 1.618. This ratio appears inarchitecture, art, various ratios of parts of the human body to each other,canned goods, and other places we find esthetically pleasing.<p><li>To describe musical notes. If a length of musical string is divided in theratio of 1:2, the note of the shorter section is exactly one octave higher thanthe note of the longer.<p></ul>Thanks to Stephen Willoughby , author of <i>Mathematics Education for a ChangingWorld</i> (ASCD, 1990), and Herb Rosenfeld.<p><hr>                    <h2>     McDonald's Claim</h2><hr>You and a friend read in the newspaper that 7 percent of all Americans eat atMcDonald's each day.

Since the Newtonian Revolution,science and scientists have gained an authority rivaling the priests and theirdogma of an earlier period. Since the Enlightenment, societal institutions andcultural works have reflected the world view offered by scientists. Positive andnegative responses to the implications of applying this Newtonian world viewhave dominated the production of art, music, literature, economics, andpolitical philosophy. However, during the last century the "New Physics" hasbrought new insights into the functioning of our world, and these discoverieshave brought new challenges to our thinking. How have our culture and itsinstitutions responded, and how will they respond, to this new revolution? Howcan the non-scientific community be educated to understand the importance oflearning scientific concepts?<p>1. You will demonstrate that you understand the differences between Newtonianand quantum physics by describing in writing how Newtonian and quantum physicstreat each of the following:<p><ul>  <li>scientist as neutral observer   <li> outcomes as certainty, as probability (causality)<li>the world as one in change vs. the world as having permanence and an     absolute set of underpinnings <li>common sense vs. mathematical prediction</ul>(20 points)<p>2. You will choose a work from one of the following fields (or a field of yourchoosing) and show how an interpretation of one work in the field could containunderlying assumptions based on either Newtonian or quantum physics. (10 pointsfor brief description of topic and plan; 20 points for initial analysis andnotes; critical feedback from group required)<p><ul><li> Economic theory (Marx, Smith, Keynes, Friedman, etc.)<li> Political theory (Social Darwinism, Leninism, etc.)<li>Psychology (Freud, Jung, Adler, Skinner, Erikson, etc.)<li>Art (Romantics, Realists, Dada, Impressionists, etc.)<li>Music (classical, atonal, etc.)<li>Literature (Cummings, Swift, Existentialists, etc.) <li>Urban planning and architecture</ul><p>3. You will then take this speculative reasoning one step further and ask: Whatif the assumptions of the other physics (Newtonian or quantum) were to beapplied to that work? How would that work look? In what ways would it have tochange? In short, you will show that you know how to apply the underlyingassumptions of a world view based upon a field of physics to a work from anotherfield.

It's notjust school either; if we look at how we certify doctors andteachers, we'll see an enormous emphasis on written tests. Too ofteneven writing isn't required. I sure hope airline pilots need to domore to get their licenses than fill in ovals on a multiple-choicetest.<p>        I recently attended a conference held by the Coalition ofEssential Schools to select schools that could be consideredexemplars of reform. About 50 people went through a variety ofworkshops trying to figure out what should characterize such modelschools. I decided to count the number of times somebody said, "Iwant to see it," or, "Show me what it looks like." Everybody wastalking about what these schools might look like, but when it came tohow schools would be selected, it was a different story. "We shouldwrite ethnographies about them," somebody suggested. "Schools shouldsubmit written documentation as proof of their status as an EssentialSchool," somebody else said. Written documentation was the way peoplewere going to see the school and understand how it functions.<p>        Prior to the meeting, participants were asked to read a 25-pageethnography of one school to discuss whether and how it could becalled an Essential School. The study was wonderfully written, and Ienjoyed reading it, but I strongly questioned if this should be theonly way to present such documentation. Herein lies the problem:People want to see it, and writing alone can't show a school.<p>        Seymour Sarason, in his <i>Letters to a Serious EducationPresident</i>, writes:<p>"I and others can talk and write endlessly about what classrooms areand should be..., but we are using language as a way to engender whatwe hope is appropriate imagery. Whatever the power of language inthis regard, it lacks the concreteness and compellingness of seeing."1<p>        But there is another way of seeing. If used correctly, it allowsschools and school people to be seen performing, and allows theviewers to make up their own minds. This medium shows--not tells--whatschool is like. I'm talking about video, and the people to controland produce it should be the educators and students themselves. Inthis paper, I discuss how video provides another way of seeingschools. Video, in conjunction with written documentation, canpresent a clearer picture of what is really going on in schools, andcan become a dynamic tool for accountability.<p><hr><h2>Writing, Video, and Accountability</h2><hr>        Remember the old saying, "Believe half of what you see and noneof what you hear"? How much of what we read about schools should webelieve? Of course, video, like writing, has pitfalls that must beaddressed. But before we take up video, let's examine how writingfosters accountability. Or does it?<p>        I've described writing as primarily "telling." Those of us whovisit schools regularly have all experienced reading something abouta school, then going there and seeing the school very differently.This is as much a fault of the medium as ot the schools. Consider howoften these accounts of schools are narrated by one "voice," thewriter's. This makes for good stories, and good writers get theirpoint across, but it does not mean that what they present is thewhole story, or even the real story. It is only rarely that writingabout schools incorporates multiple voices (teachers, students,visitors) talking about the same thing. Instead, the writer makes allthe selections and frames it--in other words, telling the story.<p>         On first thought, video would appear to be very different: Thecamera never lies. But video too often falls into the same traps, inpart because many who go into video are writers first and lack avisual creativity. Their purpose is to report, or tell, a storyrather than let the story tell itself.<p>         When, for example, we watch the TV news, we are seeing someonetell a story with a barrage of what I call "moving video slides"--10to 15 second clips of an event taking place with a voice-over by thereporter covering the story. The writer is the one actually tellingthe story by selecting and manipulating the pictures we see, and bytelling us what we are seeing. An extreme example of the writer'scontrol over what we see came when NBC rigged the explosion of GMpick-ups in crash tests. Contrast this with the amateur video of theRodney King beating, which allowed Americans to make up their ownminds about what happened.<p>         In the last decade, nature shows on TV have become moreauthentic, and, at the same time, extremely popular, becausebiologists have taken over the production responsibilities for theshows. They could do this because the technology is now easier to useand lighter in the field. The result is nature through the eyes ofthe biologist, not the TV producer--"nature in the raw...animalsdoing what comes naturally."2 Why not show schools through the eyesof educators and students?<p>         Today's video technology is within the reach of anyone who wantsto learn to use it: Teachers, students, and administrators have thepower to control what we see about their schools. Generally when yousee a video on education, it has been produced by people who knowlittle about schools. They tend to cover schools the way they coverother stories: brief video clips with voice-overs, only rarelyshowing any depth. Instead, it is the educators themselves who shouldproduce the videos, not just because they're in the schools already,but because in doing so they become accountable for what theypresent.<p> <hr><h3>Video as Exhibition: Three Functions for Accountability</h3><hr>        Many Coalition schools have adopted the principle of "graduationby exhibition": that students, rather than just accumulating therequisite number of credits, need to demonstrate what they know andcan do in authentic, public ways in order to graduate. Joe McDonaldhas described three basic functions of the exhibition as follows: 1)it "faces outward," bringing student performance into the open forpublic examination; 2) it "points inward," helping the school to seebetter the operation of its own systems by the light of the learningoutcomes these systems produce; and 3) it "presses deeper," movinglearning toward genuine understanding even while assessing it.3 Takentogether, these three functions of an exhibition represent crucialcomponents of a school's accountability system.<p>         Video can be considered part of a school's exhibition, and assuch it supports each of the three functions described above. I'lltake up each in turn, looking at how video: 1) faces outward bycommunicating the school's performance to the community; 2) pointsinward by helping the school develop a reflective capacity and byproviding something upon which to reflect; and 3) presses deeper bycapturing student performance in ways that document growth of realunderstanding.<p> <hr><h3>Facing Outward: Communicating Out</h3><hr>        When we began the "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere" tele-workshop4at Thayer, we had in mind a kind of C-Span for schools, which wouldallow viewers to see the process of schooling in depth, both thesuccesses and the failures. Give people enough information, wethought, and let them make up their own minds. By doing so, we wouldbe asking schools to become publicly accountable for these processes,thereby encouraging them as well to get better.<p>         In the early stages of "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere" we thoughtthat participating schools might develop video portfolios to documenttheir change process. Taking video, archiving it, and then putting ittogether topically-for example, by the nine Common Principles of theCoalition--would yield a powerful account of how a school is changing.Schools could then share their stories with others, learning from andcontributing to others. The video portfolios might serve twoaccountability purposes: 1) to foster the development of reflectivecapacity for staff and program development within the school (moreabout this later), and 2) serve as a means for the school tocommunicate out beyond its walls.<p>         We often talk about "stakeholders" in our public schools--parents, businesses that may employ graduates and colleges that mayadmit them, state and district education authorities, and thetaxpayers who pay for the enterprise. What do they know about what'sgoing on in schools, and how do they know it? Schools are like ablack box, from which emerge only transcripts, test scores, lettersof recommendation, an occasional local news story (often onlyfollowing an "incident"), and rumors. Video holds the key to openingup that box.<p>         More and more school districts now use local or educationalaccess channels to show the community what is going on in theschools. For example, since 1971, the Salem, New Hampshire, schooldistrict has broadcast over Channel 30 a variety of studentpresentations and projects, such as "A Celebration of Inventions" andseventh grade interactive video projects. Television also helps thedistrict to involve parents in their children's education throughprograms like "Tell Me a Story" and "Helping Your Child EnjoyReading." Informational programs, such as school board meetings andChapter 1 introductory videos, are also broadcast. The medium iscontrolled by the educators and meets the specific needs forinformation of the community. Its effect has been to open up schoolsto the community--the essence of accountability.5<p>         As a teacher, I have used video often to present student work toparents. When parents see the work their children are actually doing,they are able to make up their own minds about it. In my experience,parents are most often impressed by the variety of skills thestudents are learning, and many are moved by what they see. Some whowere initially skeptical about the kinds of projects we are doinghave become supportive of them.<p>         On "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere" we regularly air videos fromparticipating schools on topics ranging from assessment toscheduling. These videos allow teachers and administrators to seewhat's happening in other schools without having to visit, which is agreat resource, but is often limited by time and cost. In the future,Thayer and other schools with innovative programs might be portrayedin a "digital school profile." This profile would incorporate video,along with text, graphics, and audio, into a multimedia computerdocument presenting valuable information about the school in aneasily transportable, user-friendly format.6<p> <hr><h3>Pointing Inward: Building Reflective Capacity Within the School</h3><hr>        Video changes people's behavior. I wonder how many students havebeen encouraged to write using a computer by watching the TVcharacter Doogie Howser write in his electronic journal at the end ofeach show. I know that after the TV movie on Thayer, A Town TornApart, portrayed an advisory group meeting, I became more sensitiveto my own advisory. What a powerful tool for changing practice videocould be if exemplary pedagogy from schools were taped and broadcast.<p>         Video can be equally powerful in changing practice within aschool. To prove it, I'd like to tell a story about a video projectwe did at Thayer this past holiday season. One day, unannounced,Dennis Littky, our principal, walked into every classroom andvideotaped each teacher for five minutes. While every teachercooperated, demonstrating the trust we have in Dennis, some teacherscame to me later to ask, "What's he doing?" "I wasn't at my best,"they'd say, or, "How's he going to use it?"<p>         What Dennis and I were doing was putting together the firstpiece of Dennis' holiday present to every teacher, a customized copyof A Town Torn Apart. The first 15 minutes of tape before the moviepresented Dennis, dressed as Santa, sneaking into the teacher's roomat night and giving that teacher a personal holiday greeting in aquasi-evaluative format, describing the things he or she did for theschool over the year and the areas in which Dennis saw growth. Nextcame a clip of Dennis and the teacher talking about the year so far.Finally, we added the piece from the teacher's class.<p>         At our holiday party, we all got together and watched the tapes.Teachers were looking into each other's classrooms and commenting onwhat they saw--something very rare in American public high schools. Iput together a brief feedback sheet to see how helpful these videoswere for teachers and handed them out at our next staff meeting. Someteachers responded that they had never seen what was going on behindthem in their classrooms, or that they had never known they had thisor that mannerism. Seeing the video effected how they taught the nextday.<p>         Of course, not every principal could or should go into teachers'classrooms unannounced with a camcorder and start shooting. But everyschool can work out ways for teachers to see their own, and,eventually, each other's work on tape, and create a forum for talkingabout what they see. Video can become the basis for reflectivecapacity within the school. At Thayer, following the holiday tapesuccess, I asked teachers if I could go into their classrooms once amonth, again unannounced, and tape for five minutes on their personaltape, which then would be available for them to do with as theypleased. Over the course of the year, they would have 45 or 50minutes of themselves on tape. Many responded that they would love todo this. This is a project we will begin at Thayer in September,1993.<p>         When "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere" started, it was ourintention to show not only exemplary practices in action, but alsothe real school context in which they occur. When I started to tapeteachers and students, we ran into disagreements in the workshop'splanning group about whether or not viewers would learn more from themistakes than from the successes. We tried to capture the real thingand from that generate the workshops, with some interesting results.<p>         During the "Student as Worker, Teacher as Coach" "Here, Thayer,and Everywhere" workshop, Julie Gainsburg, a teacher at Thayer,invited participants to view her math class and discuss whether shewas acting as a coach while teaching in the front of the room. Sincethere was no voice-over, only a real classroom situation, viewers hadto decide for themselves. Julie learned a tremendous amount from theprocess. Furthermore, the feedback from that workshop suggests thatnot only the teacher whose classroom is presented benefits fromreflecting on real practice. A teacher participating in the workshopwho's been resistant to change said Julie's piece was the best staffdevelopment activity he'd ever experienced, because it was real andallowed you to make up your own mind.<p>         It takes brave teachers like Julie to lead the way for otherteachers to share their classroom work--and their students'--on video.How different would it have been if Julie had written a paper aboutwhat she thought of herself as a coach in that situation? Schoolsneed to create opportunities for teachers to see their ownperformance and their classes' privately, and, eventually, also insupportive forums of "critical friends." These kinds of forums leadnot only to changes in individual teacher's practice, but also in theculture of the school.<p>         The same opportunity for reflection exists with studentperformance. On the most recent "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere"Kristine, a Thayer student, gave the oral presentation part of herSenior Exhibition project. As Kristine is interested in a career incommunications, her "essential question" was: Does the media shapesociety or reflect it? For this workshop, we had a panel of judgesconsisting of a student and teacher from another high school andmyself. Participants at all the sites were asked to use Thayer'scriteria to assess her performance. They were invited to call in andexplain their scoring. Kristine loved the experience, and the staffgained valuable feedback on how we assess exhibitions.<p>         In similar fashion, Linda Nathan, Co-Director of Fenway MiddleCollege High School in Boston, brings video of her students'exhibitions when she does workshops for schools. After showing thevideos, Linda asks teachers, "Is this good enough? Do students havethe skills and knowledge they need to get to the next step?"Discussions among teachers tend to be deep, because they are able tomake up their own minds about the students' performances. Theexperience benefits both Linda, who gains perspective on theexhibition's design and her students' performances, and the workshopparticipants, who gain insight for developing exhibitions for theirschools.<p>         These uses of video can enhance reflective capacity within oneschool or within a cluster of schools. Though we often have the samestudents as other teachers in the school, we rarely look at anddiscuss their work collectively. The videotaped exhibition affordsthe opportunity to see what kind of graduates we are producing, and,from that vantage point, examine the school's systems for helpingstudents get there.<p>         At a staff meeting, we viewed Kristine's performance again, thistime with the goal of giving teachers a chance to develop standardsand reflect on how this might effect their own classroom activities.At Thayer, we tape all our senior exhibitions. One goal of thisdocumentation is to reflect on whether we are truly assessingstudents on the 19 graduation skills we have developed as a staff andwhether students' work has the depth and breadth we value.<p> <hr><h3>Pressing Deeper: Capturing Real Learning</h3><hr>        The third component of accountability deals specifically withstudent performance and how we assess it. As I've written, schoolsare used to evaluating students' work based on written, and morerarely, oral performance. These kinds of assessments tend to besummative: the lab report, the research paper, the paper-and-penciltest.<p>         When we use video to create longitudinal studies of studentlearning, they yield interesting results. In this regard videoreflects the way writing is frequently taught--though not alwaysassessed--these days: as a process. When I taught writing, I wouldalways show my students the letters Tolstoy and Ghandi wrote to oneanother. The writing is messy and full of changes, with wordsscratched out and new ones inserted all over the place. This is whatwriting and thinking really look like--revising words and sentencesmirrors thinking. But books never show us the messiness, and this canbe misleading and intimidating to students.<p>         Video also shows thinking. When you tape someone at work, youtape the mistakes and the successes, something polished writing andprofessionally made videotapes generally lack. The mess is what showsprocess and progress, and making progress is what education is allabout. When we put too much emphasis on the product, we may be losingour best evidence of real learning the progress.<p>         We are already familiar with television programs that presentprocess as a means of learning as well as entertainment--This OldHouse, which teaches about home restoration by following an actualproject, and the Lifetime channel's medical series, which showsactual operations being performed while the doctors explain theprocedure. These shows capture real thinking and learning in theconstruction and medical professions--why not such process-drivenprograms for education?<p>         For our "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere" workshops on "Teaming"and "Integrating Curriculum," we decided to tape our seventh gradeteam at Thayer. Using the Foxfire approach, the teachers decided tolet students develop some of their own essential questions andprojects that would integrate math, science, English, and socialstudies. I taped students as they developed questions. A month later,I taped the same students as they worked on the questions. When weviewed the tapes, teachers were, in Stephanie Brodie's words,"overwhelmed and mesmerized" by the sophistication studentsdemonstrated, an observation they might not have made without theopportunity to see the process rather than simply the product ofstudents' work.<p>         As Collins, Hawkins and Frederiksen have described, we can't"reconstruct" a student's abilities from just one source. With moreways of looking at a student--video, written logs, self-evaluations,etc.--we get "a much richer notion of what a student's abilities are.By enriching the way we assess students, we will enrich the way weeducate them."7 At Brooklyn Technical High School, students workingon collaborative design projects are assessed on written group andindividual logs, the presentations, and the videos of both processand product. With these multiple measures--three out of four of whichare process-oriented--teachers have a much better picture of the depthof each student's real learning.<p>         Videotaping students over their school career--givingexhibitions, collaborating with other students, participating inschool meetings, etc.--provides a picture of change and growth, andoffers a powerful vehicle not just for assessment, but for students'reflection on their own learning. When students see themselveslearning--and we show them that we value that process, not just thegrade--they become more accountable. I think of the movie The Sting inwhich Paul Newman and Robert Redford are much less interested in themoney than the process of putting together and pulling off the"perfect con." The whole movie is really about education, even if itis a con artist's.<p> <hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><hr>        Accountability is inseparable from standards. Sizer, McDonaldand Rogers have written that standards, in whatever criteria orrubrics they are expressed, "come to life in the face of performance,then fade in clarity and power as images from the performance fade."8That's true of standards for students, teachers, and schools. Videois probably our most effective tool for keeping performance alive,without which standards whither to meaninglessness.<p>         I'd like to return to the experience of broadcasting one girl'sexhibition on "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere." Groups of school peoplegathered in approximately 400 sites to watch Kristine's performance,then assess it. A national discussion of viewers concerned witheducation followed. We all left the workshop more informed about whatkinds of standards we should attach to performance. While I'm notsuggesting every student's work should be subjected to this kind ofpublic scrutiny, or anything like it, I will say using video to bringreal student work out of the "black box" of the classroom raisesimportant questions about accountability for student, teacher, andschool performance: Is the student accountable? Her teachers? Theschool? The community? To all, I'd answer: You Bet! The sooner westart talking about the implications of that accountability, thesooner we'll have the schools we want. Video, if it's real, takentogether with writing and other documentation, can furnish the rawmaterial that allows people to make up their own minds. Only fromthat point can we refashion our schools to become truly accountable.<p> <hr><h2>Appendix A: Technical Requirements</h2><hr>        What follows is my list of minimum requirements for a school totake video of adequate quality for the purposes I discuss in thispaper. Of course, if a school has the resources, it can buy muchfancier equipment and expect better results. I'd estimate normalstart-up costs at about $5,000.<p> <ul><li>      <b>Camcorder. </b>A school needs a camcorder that shoots well in lowlight (5 lux or lower) because schools are in many instances poorlylit for camcorders.<li>    <b> Audio. </b>Without good pictures and good sound no one will watchyour video. Since I have not found a camcorder that has a goodmicrophone built in, I suggest you buy one. You should be able to geta good stick microphone for less than $200.<li>    <b>VCRs and editing equipment.  </b>Camcorder salespeople may not tellyou that to get your video into a presentable format you need to dosome basic editing. Videotape is cheap, which is good because you canshoot almost everything, and bad because you'll need to do someediting if anyone's going to watch what you shoot. By buyingcompatible VCR's and attaching them to an editing controller, you canget glitch-free edits and sequence your segments.<li>       <b>Videotape.</b> You should be aware that each time you go down ageneration you lose quality, but videotape is still a veryinexpensive way to document your school. Be prepared to buy a lot andtape a lot!</ul><p> <hr><h2>Appendix B: Getting Started</h2><hr>        Following are some suggestions of how video can be used byteachers and administrators to begin to enhance accountability inevery school. Of course, once a school begins to use video for thispurpose, it will develop its own most powerful uses.<p> <ul><li>     Tape presentations of your students and archive them on eitherclass tapes or individual student tapes.<li>    Look at student performance longitudinally by recording studentsthroughout the year and having teachers and students assess theirprogress over time.<li>       Tape your students working and reflect on the entire process oflearning--not just the end product--for a better and more completeappreciation of student work.<li>     Use video to show parents, community members and others what andhow the students are learning.<li>      Show younger students videotaped examples of what they'll beexpected to do.<li>    Use tapes of yourself and students to generate discussions withfellow teachers about how aspects of your performance and classperformance can improve.<li>    Have students keep their own video resume and documentation forstudent portfolios.<li>     Document the changes you are making in your school to develop aschool video portfolio for the purposes of program evaluation andaccountability.</ul><p> <hr><h2>Footnotes</h2><hr><ol><li> Seymour Sarason.

<html><head><title>CES: Publications: Research Papers: Anatomy of an Exhibition</title></head><body><p><hr><h1><center>Anatomy of an Exhibition</center></h1><hr><h3><center>by Jody Brown Podl, Coalition of Essential Schools<br>and Margaret Metzger, Brookline (MA) High School</center></h3><center>March, 1992</center><hr><p><i>The Coalition of Essential Schools gratefully acknowledgesthe IBM Corporationandthe UPS Foundationfor their support of its research on Exhibitions.<p><b>Special Thanks:</b>The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions ofMargaret Metzger's two 1991-92 Senior European Literatureclasses. It is these students' hard work that has guided ourthoughts about Exhibitions and our writing of this paper.</i><p><hr>        Margaret Metzger has taught English at Brookline High School inMassachusetts for twenty-two years. In this article, we describeMargaret's initial attempt to use exhibitions as a means ofassessment in her classroom.1 As our title implies, anexhibition, like a living creature, is a complex organism,composed of many vital and inter-connected elements. We havedissected this exhibition in an attempt not only to understandthe intricacies of the organs, bones, muscles, and nerves butalso to see how these components ultimately fit together to formthe whole.<p>        This example demonstrates how exhibitions serve threeintegral functions. First, they make schools externallyaccountable by providing members of the community an opportunityto view the goings-on in their schools. Second, they make schoolsinternally accountable by generating valuable information aboutwhat and how students are learning. This healthy scrutiny promptsschools to make changes, if necessary, so that they can graduatethoughtful and capable students. Third, and perhaps mostimportantly, exhibitions encourage students to move toward deeperand more substantive understandings and, in so doing, askteachers to shift their emphasis from transferring information toproviding a usable base of skills and knowledge (McDonald, 1992).<p><hr><h2>Vision</h2><hr>        Margaret has taught Dante's Inferno to her senior EuropeanLiterature classes for the past ten years. Until this year, shehad always been the primary actor in teaching the book's thirty-four cantos, starting each day with a short reading quiz, thenmoving on to lead a discussion about some of the daily canto'smajor themes and patterns. Students did a project at the end ofthe unit, usually some creative presentation on Dante.<p>        The final test on the book was a ten-page multiple-choice,short-answer, and essay exam which depended on students' recallof textual minutiae. Year after year, students did poorlyon the exam; in a typical class, two thirds ofthem would receive a grade of C or lower. Class discussions andwritten work convinced Margaret that students knew the materialmuch better than they could demonstrate on the final exam, whichonly raised both Margaret's and her students' level offrustration.<p>        Obviously, something needed to change; but lacking analternative, Margaret continued to work with the archaic test. Atfirst, she tried giving more review sheets and study sessions.She tinkered with the questions and at one point expanded theexam to a three-day marathon. "I knew something was drasticallywrong," she recalls. "Even though my frustrations lay with theexam and not my students, it never occurred to me to change thewhole concept. Then I read Ted Sizer's work on exhibitions, 2 andit struck a chord of common sense. Like much of what he writes,his words made me ask myself, ÔWhy didn't I think of thisbefore?'"<p>        Margaret realized that a discrepancy existed between whatshe was teaching and what she was testing. The test focused onnitpicky details, whereas her teaching focused on thinking andreading skills, on encouraging her students to be independentlearners within a community that has rigorous academic standards.In addition, she saw that two other philosophical ideas she hadheld for a long time propelled her to change her ideas aboutassessment: first, that students want to do rigorous, honestacademic work; second, that students must own their own work andtheir own learning. "In other words," Margaret realized, "my jobis to set up situations so that they work hard. I do not wantstudents to admire how smart I am; I want students to know howsmart <i>they</i> are."<p>        This vision of thoughtful, independent students tookpriority over passing on information about the content of anyparticular piece of literature. Inall her literature classes, Margaret teaches her students how toread with sophistication so that they will know how to readbeyond content and plot. Throughout the year, students learn waysto approach reading: to create mental pictures of scenes andcharacters, to investigate how form fits content, to abstractfrom specific details to ascertain general themes, to make senseof the author's choices about style and structure. As herstudents read, she asks them to articulate what skills they useto arrive at their understanding of a text. Students are expectedto transfer these comprehension skills from one piece ofliterature to the next. Since Dante is particularly difficult,students need a lot of instruction on how to read him, and theyare dazzled at their progress when they do get it.<p>        Clearly, if she was aiming to develop independent andthoughtful readers, Margaret needed to fit the test to theteaching -and that meant throwing out the test and startingover.<p><hr><h2>The Plan</h2><hr>Margaret introduced exhibitions to her two European Literatureclasses after she had taught the first half of <i>The Inferno</i>, about amonth into the book. She began by handing out a nine-page memowhich included a rationale for the idea, quotations from Ted Sizer(1984) and Grant Wiggins (1989), and samples of materials. Shepurposely gave her students as much information about the procedureas possible, so everyone would know the expectations. The memobegan:<p>        Instead of a final exam and project on Dante, you willdemonstrate that you can read and under-stand a Canto from TheInferno which has not been discussed in class.<p>        The overall structure of the assignment: The whole class willread and discuss the first half of <i>The Inferno</i>. For the second halfof the book, I will assign pairs of you to one Canto, which youwill prepare and present to the class. The presentation will becalled An Exhibition, meaning that you must exhibit your knowledge.You will have about seven class periods to prepare, as well asadditional time outside of class.<p>        For your Exhibition, you will present your Canto to a panelof three outside judges: one peer who is not taking the course, oneadult outside of the school, and one adult from within the school.You will select the first two, and I will arrange for the third.<p>        Your exhibition must include a brief check that yourclassmates have read the Canto you are presenting. (The mosttraditional way of checking is simply to give a quiz.) Next, eachof you will read aloud to the class a paper that you have writtenabout the Canto on a subject of your choice. Finally, you willteach the class a major concept in the Canto. You are free tochoose any appropriate pedagogy for the teaching section of theexhibition: class discussion, dramatic presentation, art work,Socratic Seminar, small-group work, role playing, or whatever.<p>        With these ground rules, Margaret opened up the class fordiscussion and questions. She straight-forwardly admitted that shehad never attempted this kind of assessment before. She wassomewhat apprehensive about how her students would react to such aforeign idea. Several students candidly expressed concerns aboutmanaging this task in the midst of preparing their collegeapplications, about the role of the judges, and about the prospectof "performing" before their peers. Others, the natural risk-takers, requested more flexibility in designing their exhibitions.<p>        Despite the uncertainty that pervaded the room, none of thestudents resisted the idea; in fact, many said they were excited totry something new. Kneeling on the floor, Margaret wrote the namesof the partners and cantos on a huge newsprint calendar as herstudents hovered around her, wondering aloud about what exactlythey were being asked to do.<p><hr><h2>Teacher Preparation</h2><hr>Even though the workload later tapered off considerably as studentsimmersed themselves in their cantos and did their exhibitions,preparing the exhibition consumed a great deal of Margaret's timeearly on. She spent two full evenings making the plan for theexhibition, including writing the response forms which would beneeded later, drafting the "Judge's Criteria Sheet," and makinglists of "Topics which might be covered in an exhibition,"potential problems, and fourteen procedural steps for theexhibition process.<p>        The most difficult part of the preplanning was pairingstudents, which took three or four hours. In the end, she assignedpartners for many different reasons; learning styles,personalities, and friend-ship patterns all affected her choices.The enormous amount of time devoted to the careful partnering paidoff, however, since the students needed to be able to collaboratein order to make sense of their cantos, using each other assounding boards for questions, ideas, and revelations.<p>        Keeping more than twenty pairs of students on task, allworking at different paces, required additional materials: largenewsprint calendars on the wall that listed homework assignments,exhibition presenters, and judges; fifteen manila folders thatincluded memos to judges, instruction sheets, response forms,drafts of papers, exhibition plans, and other handouts.<p>        Margaret's next step, arranging for judges, was madeparticularly difficult by the fact that her school was embroiled ina work-to-the-rule contract dispute. She could not ask otherteachers to come into her class because all teachers had tocomplete their work between eight and two. She did, however, askhigh school and central office administrators, school committeemembers, and pupil-support staff. She sent brief form letters thatexplained the project and asked for their assistance, if theirschedules allowed for it. All responses were positive; those whowere unable to judge could not do so because of conflictingschedules.<p>        Initially, Margaret worried that it took too much time to setup such an elaborate structure, and she knew that she could notsustain that much time on two classes without completely neglectingher other classes. Although the first few days demanded constantattention to detail, daily planning was not required once thestructure was in place. Furthermore, although she spent severalevenings working on the exhibition plan, this was still much lesstime than she would normally spend planning a month's worth oflessons.<p>        This is not to say that Margaret's work was done once she hadpassed out the instructions, paired the students, and scheduled thejudges. During the week of in-class time which students used toprepare their exhibitions, formal instruction gave way to coaching.Margaret conferenced with partners, read drafts of students'papers, and used a checklist of the various steps in the process tokeep track of the progress everyone was making. For instance, earlyon in the process, partners had to fill out a two-pagecomprehension sheet that asked them about their understanding oftheir canto. Margaret wrote extensive comments, pushing students togo further and sometimes even to start over completely. This kindof individualized coaching, built into the structure of theexhibition, allowed Margaret to maintain a strong sense of thedirection in which each student was moving.<p>        For the five weeks of the exhibitions presentations,Margaret's workload lightened consider-ably. The students ran thetwo classes entirely, and Margaret did not stand up in front of thegroups except to give minor announcements and to introduce thejudges. Each day she read four papers, one from each student whohad made a presentation that day. Thus, two major sets of paperswere staggered over the five-week period. Because she was fillingout the criteria sheets during the exhibitions, the bulk of herevaluation was complete when the bell rang. Later, she read theother judge's evaluations and assigned a final grade.<p><hr><h2>Student Preparation</h2><hr>        Students spent a week of class time working in pairs to study theircantos and to plan their exhibitions. Virtually every minute ofevery day, the classroom seemed animated and focused. At one point,Margaret commented, in partial surprise, "There is no divergentconversation here. They are on task the whole time." Because the students were clear about the task and encouraged to act independently, they demonstrated a range of unusually mature work habits.<p>        Students used well the techniques, information, and conceptsthat they had learned in studying the first half of the book as thebasis of their study of the second half. As Jen and Illanastruggled with a difficult passage, Jen made a connection: "Remember when we learned about style, that a smaller thing representsthe whole? This must be what he's doing here." The two thenproceeded to reread the passage together. Wendy and Seizi, knowingthat most cantos were based around central images, worked toidentify the central image in theirs. Toward the end of the period,Wendy noticed the preponderance of circles; Seizi immediately beganputting the canto in much clearer perspective.<p>        It was also gratifying to see how well they collaborated. Ontheir first day working together, Melita admitted to David that shedid not understand the setting. David, who had figured it outhimself, took out a sheet of paper and drew it for Melita. Lookingat his sketch, Melita wondered why Dante would position a characterin such a peculiar way. Sprawled on the floor with drawing and bookin front of them, the two set about investigating Melita's query.On the other side of the room, Peter had come up with a list ofstorm images, and Masha had compiled one of animal images. As theycompared notes, each added his or her own observations to theother's list.<p>        While all the students were deeply involved in their work,the flexible structure of the exhibition put everyone at adifferent step in the process. For instance, Nora and Liz bouncedideas back and forth about the denotations of the word "discord,"which was in the title of their canto, while Becky and Cairn had ananimated discussion about the "grossness" of Dante's description intheirs. Meanwhile, two other pairs read silently, not yet ready totalk with each other.<p>        The students, in essence, had taken over. They appropriatedthe room: upon entering the class, the students immediatelyrearranged the furniture so that each pair could have its own spacein which to work. They appropriated the text: Canto XXVI became mycanto or our canto. And they appropriated the responsibility forlearning: no longer waiting for the teacher's directions, eachpair, at the end of class, assessed what they had accomplished andwhere they wanted to go and then assigned themselves homework.<p>        Even amid this diversity, the bulk of everyone's first fewdays focused on comprehension. Students struggled to understand thegeneral ideas in their canto (simply the plot) and individual lines(including subtle metaphors). Margaret was surprised at howconfused many of the students were. While they were studying thefirst half of the book, students could hide their confusion as longas they could pass the daily quiz. Now, she saw that they hadbasically grasped what she said about each canto, but had notunderstood much beyond her words. In fact, at first, many of themcould not figure out the basic action in the canto. When they hadto struggle with one canto, rather than rushing through a new cantoeach day, both their confusion and their level of comprehensionbecame more obvious to Margaret as well as to themselves.<p>        It was scary for the students to admit to each other thatthey didn't understand the book, and that it was theirresponsibility to uncover the meaning. Margaret was tempted to"give answers," or at least hints, but she resisted. Instead, shefocused her efforts on asking more questions and encouragingstudents to keep delving, even when they felt stuck, complacent, orprematurely successful. Because Margaret was so good at pressingher students to search for the answers themselves rather thanproviding the information that they sought, the students learned torely on themselves and each other rather than on her. Her goal ofmaking the students independent learners with high academicstandards was no longer theoretical. Sometimes she stood in thecorner not knowing quite what to do!<p>        Another major requirement of the exhibition called forstudents to prepare, write, and read an analytical essay abouttheir canto. As always, the most difficult part of the writing wasselecting a topic and developing a thesis. Students had to dooriginal thinking; they could not base the paper on outsidecritical essays. In her role as coach, Margaret challenged andquestioned their topics and theses. Partners also read andcommented on each other's drafts. During the week, students wroteseveral drafts; writing and rewriting the papers helped thestudents clarify their thinking about the canto and about theirexhibition.<p>        With this focus in mind, the students had to determine how toget what they had learned across to their peers. Of course, theyrelied heavily on modeling their teaching on their own classroomexperiences. Sadly, the students realized that they could not thinkof varied classroom activities and claimed that all of theirclasses were alike. Margaret reviewed the techniques that she hadused in September and October, but students still felt stymied.<p>        One particularly useful parameter was that Margaret insistedthat the exhibitions not be "cute." Although Margaret worried thatstudents would not understand her when she banned "cute," thestudents laughed and said they understood exactly what she meant.At first, one pair wanted to do a puppet show of a particularlygrotesque scene, which might have trivialized the pain andsuffering of the characters. Another group considered writing andperforming a rap version of their canto, which might have violatedthe integrity of the language.3 Students began to monitor theappropriateness of their presentations and realized that both planswere unacceptable because they reduced the complexity and seriousness of Dante. In some ways, this prohibition against "cute" madedesigning their teaching activities even more difficult, but itvalidated serious, intellectual work.<p>        Looking back, two factors conspired against the students'work during the preparation period. First, because the studentstook so long to comprehend the material, they did not have enoughtime to plan their teaching activity. Second, for many studentsthis was the first time they had ever considered the issue ofpedagogy; therefore, they needed a significant amount of time tothink it through. Despite these problems -and because they were soeager to help each other out of this predicament -the partnersmanaged to create focused, lively, and high-powered lessons.<p>        Although the students definitely needed help figuring out howto teach their cantos, it was impossible to squeeze additional timeinto the curriculum for teaching them pedagogy. In the future,Margaret will make explicit -on a daily basis -the pedagogicalapproaches that she uses so that her students are conscious ofteaching options for the next exhibition. She will also ask thestudents to add to this list any classroom experiences from othercourses that seem useful to this brain-storming process. Mostimportantly, she will ask them to consider what they enjoy asstudents and what teaching styles most enable them to learn.<p><hr><h2>The Exhibitions</h2><hr>        The exhibitions were intense. No time was wasted, because studentswere anxious to cover huge amounts of material in fifty minutes. Inthe back of the room sat anywhere from three to seven adultswatching the proceedings. Despite the large audience, the studentsconcentrated on each other and the material. Because each day had adifferent teacher, canto, and teaching technique, every classseemed riveting.<p>        Students usually began with a short quiz anda brief summary of the plot. Next, the pair presented a preplannedactivity using some creative teaching technique that matched thematerial they were trying to convey. This section was the mostinteresting, and usually the most anxiety provoking for theexhibitors. Many students opted to hold discussions. Andrew andAllison led a Socratic Seminar. Brian and Dennis divided the classin half for a debate about whether the narrator was lying. In orderto demonstrate a very confusing canto, Becky and Cairn wrote ascript based on their canto and asked the entire class to act itout. Finally, at some appropriate point during each class, bothpartners read their papers and then answered questions about them.Many classes went overtime, and each class ended with applause.<p>        The students' depth of understanding was often impressive.Even after teaching <i> The Inferno</i> for a decade, Margaret was thrilledthat many pairs had insights into the text which she had neverseen. On the other hand, she cringed when students offeredinaccurate interpretations. In these situations, students oftencorrected each other, either that day or a few days later. Even ifthe interpretation remained problematic, Margaret refused tointervene as the academic expert. She wanted the students to retainownership of their learning. Authentic learning entails making somemistakes.<p>        The following is a transcription of part of the discussionpertaining to Canto XXVII. For their teaching activity, thepresenters split up the class for small group discussions. Sara,the leader, has just asked her group to identify images of speechat the start of the canto. The group has found one in almost everyline.<p><b>Sara:   </b>So you can say basically that on that page there's ametaphor for speech in every tercet. Also, there's an image offlame. Like I see that, in the first tercet, "when he finishedspeaking the great flame . . ."<p>They check the other tercets for references to flames and,again, find several.<p><b>Sara: </b>  Can you see any connection between speech and the flameand how the sinners were encased in the flame inhell itself? Why might Dante parallel flame and speech in everytercet?<p><b>Suzan: </b> Their method of sinning is through speech and they givebad advice. And now it's kind of muffled.<p><b>David: </b> And also their words -the way they give counsel -wouldbe like fire unto the person. They're giving evil counsel, and likedirecting those words, trying to wrap someone up in those words, issort of like the fire grabbing the sinners.<p><b>Brian: </b> I agree with what they say.Sara:   So you can see how it's kind of like a reflection ofhell. Like the fire -I think what David and Suzan said is rightbecause they use their words as a vehicle for their sins. Theirwords hid their own intentions, so now they're concealed in it. Andthat concealment, that image of being hidden in the fire, isportrayed throughout the canto. Can you see it? I mean, justthinking about it generally, there are lots of images of hidden,um, like lowly kinds of images; like in the second tercet: "themuffled roar" and then "sealed," "concealed," "hidden."<p><b>David:</b>  You mean that by giving evil counsel, they didn'tactually commit the sin but they were hiding behind the words,hiding away from the sin but still . . .<p><b>Sara: </b>  Their sin, their deceit and their words -despite theirtrue intentions -are hidden by false counsel. . . . Throughout thebook there's a constant parallel between true intentions of theperson before they give evil counsel and then there's their falsecounsel. It's like a distortion. . . . How do you think they arecontinuing their sins?<p><b>Brian: </b> They conceal it behind the flames in hell like theyconcealed it behind their words.<p><b>David: </b> Doesn't Guido, well, when he's talking to Dante, he sortof puts the blame on the Pope and it's sort of the sameway in that -well, I guess that's not continuing.<p><b>Sara:</b>   It's still the image of concealed or . . .<p><b>David: </b> When he says the Pope's the one who did it.<p><b>Sara: </b>  There's just a really great image portrayed of hiddendenial, muffled, all that kind of stuff.<p>        There are a few more questions and comments. At this point,Sara reads her paper, which compares the images of flame, speech,and concealment. In many ways, it sounds like a summation ofgroup's conversation.<p>        In their discussions, the students took charge, assertedthemselves, and made substantive, original comments. Although theleaders were invested in a particular interpretation of the text,they valued what their peers contributed. The students created,expected, and enforced standards of intellectual rigor.<p>        With few exceptions, the adults did not speak at all duringthe exhibitions and the students sustained animated discussions forfifteen- to twenty-five-minute stretches. This experience had alasting impact. After the exhibitions, when the students moved onto the next book, class discussions were noticeably more animatedand more reflective than before.<p><hr><h2>The Papers</h2><hr>        Each student wrote an essay based on an original thesis statementand read it aloud to the class. In many ways, these papers were aculmination of the authors' thinking about their cantos. Choosing their own topicsand using no outside resources, the students had the opportunity Ñand the challenge -to reveal the knowledge that they had acquiredas a result of their sustained focus on one canto. The studentseach wrote at least three drafts, working to clarify and refinetheir ideas.<p>        For example, one pair of students explicated Ulysses' sin inone of the cantos about Evil Counselors. First, Joanna presentedher paper about what Ulysses perceived his sin to be:<p>        Ulysses ultimately makes a grand analogy in order todemonstrate his sin of Hubris. Being of Greek heritage, he reliedon Greek mythology to explain his nature and even compared himselfto Icarus. Briefly, the story of Icarus tells of a boy whose fathergave him a pair of wings but warned him not to go too close to thesun because the wings would melt. He did not heed his father'swarning due to his great excitement and sense of power. Hemomentarily rose toward the sun but then fell and was plunged intothe sea.<p>        Ulysses' first reference to this myth is in his speech to hiscrew. "Our senses stand experience of the world beyond the sun."Ulysses preached that the purpose of their journey was to discoverthe limits of the universe; but man was not intended to challengethese limits of God. Despite this, Ulysses says, "we made wings ofour oars for our fool's flight." Because Ulysses' fate parallelsthat of Icarus, it is only fitting that the conclusion to Ulysses'journey is that "the sea closed over us and the light was gone." Asa result of thinking his powers could overcome the laws of God,Ulysses' arrogance led him to his fate in hell.<p>        Her partner Suzan's paper moved the argument one step furtherto show that it is not hubris that is Ulysses' core sin but evilcounseling:  Ulysses' true talent of coercion reveals itself in his cockydepiction of his success in convincing his fellow sailors not toabandon the expedition despite their fear and initial disinterest.Using the old trick of reverse psychology, Ulysses manages tochange their minds by attacking their vulnerable egos. "Greeks! Youwere not born to live like brutes, but to press on toward manhoodand recognition!" Seeing how convincing he was, Ulysses is sure toacknowledge and gloat about his mastery of the art of manipulation."With this brief exhortation I made my crew so eager for the voyageI could hardly have held them back from it when I was through."<p>        While Ulysses is obviously proud and boastful, his true sinremains evil counseling. In fact, Dante is his current victim ofbad advice, and therefore, he is continuing to actively practicehis true sin. By telling Dante of his own failure to voyage beyondthe limits of mortal man, he is really advising him to turn backand to abandon his plans of traveling through hell. In concludinghis tale, Ulysses refers to his journey as a "fool's flight,"implying that Dante's voyage is one of similar nature. This is themost harmful counsel that Ulysses could possibly offer Dantebecause Dante's journey is willed by God.<p>        Joanna's and Suzan's papers reveal a very complex analysisthat takes into account matters of language, perception, andculture. In the class discussion that followed, they asked theirpeers whether it was fair for Dante to punish Ulysses, a Greek, fora sin that he does not recognize, since he is unaware and ignorantof Christian ideology.<p>        Overall, these examples show that the students chosesophisticated, non-plot topics, took intellectual risks, and backedup their positions. They wrote clearly and, most importantly,passionately about their ideas. They felt as if they were theexperts on their cantos, and they were excited to share their ideaswith the class. The papers were a joy to read.<p><hr><h2>The Judges</h2><hr>        When Margaret introduced the exhibitions, the students immediatelyexpressed anxiety about having strangers in the class. "What arethey going to do here?" "Who will come in here? Our parents allwork." "Why do we have to have them?" "How will they judge if theyhaven't read the book or if they haven't heard the otherexhibitions?" Interestingly, Margaret had never considered thatthis element would elicit such a strong reaction; when placedbeside the enormity of the work that she was asking them to do, theidea of judges seemed minor. In her thinking, she was moreconcerned with keeping Ted Sizer's notion of drawing in thecommunity for a public celebration of learning than with thepractical ramifications of having outsiders assess her students'work.<p>        Furthermore, these were competent seniors who would soon bejudged by colleges, and she knew that they would not be humiliatedby presenting material in front of "outsiders." In short, she hadmore confidence in their ability than they did. But she also wantedto up the ante, and having judges was a way to ensure that thestudents knew that these exhibitions were not just another oralpresentation.<p>        While their questions did point up some legitimate issues, itbecame clear to Margaret that the idea of judges was the mostthreatening part of the whole scheme, because even though thestudents didn't at first understand the magnitude of the task orthe logistics, they could immediately get scared by the idea ofhaving strangers judge them in a classroom. The students wanted thesecurity that Margaret, who knew them well and liked them, would bethe final judge for grades. Students assumed that judges would beharsher than the known teacher. The least academically securestudents were the most anxious about judges.4<p>        After the first day's outburst of anxiety, the students nevermentioned the judges again. As they became more involved with thesubstance of their exhibitions, the students attached less and lessimportance to the judges until they became almost invisible. Theanxiety dissolved into a matter of logistics: most students easilyfound peers to serve as judges, but struggled to find neighbors,parents, or college friends.<p>        In addition to the stakes-raising advantages that the judgesprovided, having these strangers in class made for some funnymoments. While the students' attention was completely focused ontheir classmates, Margaret was amused by some of the judges'behavior. One woman, a professor from Harvard, interrupted theexhibition and lectured the class. Two judges talked to each otherthrough one whole exhibition. And one judge, a student's neighbor,commented that the work was worthy of a seminar on Dante that hehad taken in graduate school. He left the classroom, then returnedto pat Margaret on the arm, grin, and remark, "Another satisfiedtax payer!"<p><hr><h2>Grading</h2><hr>Students received two grades, one for the paper and one for theexhibition. In addition, Margaret gave some homework grades forcompleting the various check-points. She graded the papers in herusual way, looking carefully at the quality and clarity of theargument. To her delight, over 80 percent earned either an A or aB.<p>        Before the exhibitions began, the class agreed on thecriteria that the judges and Margaret would use to determine goodwork, and a simple form was given to each judge. This form includedsuch items as: "Left time for questions and fielded questionswell"; "Read a clear, brief summary of the canto which could beunderstood by someone who had not read the Canto"; "Did the totalexhibition keep the listener's attention?" A point system wasassigned.<p>        After struggling to use the judges' responses asa basis for grading the students' exhibitions, Margaret realizedthat the criteria sheets were inadequate. They clarified whatneeded to be part of each exhibition but were not specific enoughabout the quality that was expected. The criteria sheets did notask judges to evaluate the depth and quality of the thinking oneach section. Margaret plans to overhaul this part of the process.<p>        Grading the exhibitions as a whole felt trickier. After allthe effort of getting the judges' input, Margaret didn't know whatto do with it once she had it. Along these lines, there was some legitimate concernabout the role of the judges. Indeed, how could outsiders makejudgments without knowing the book or the context? How should theirassessments be figured into the overall grade? Generally, consensuswas clear on the spectacular or the disastrous; however, the middleground was muddier. Judges had no basisfor comparison, and sometimes they had not read the cantos. Inturn, many judges, particularly the peers, were hesitant to becritical. Margaret expected this problem but has not resolved it.<p>        In the end, Margaret took into consideration what the judgeswrote but made the final decisions about grades herself. If heropinion differed from the judges, she wrote a note of explanationto the students. No student contested a grade.<p><hr><h2>Student Reflections</h2><hr>After the exhibitions, Margaret spent a class period debriefing.She also asked her students to write down their reactions to doingthe exhibitions. While she had very positive feelings about thework that her students had done, she wanted to know how they feltand what they had learned.<p>        The results: her students were overwhelmingly supportive of theexperience. Many even claimed that the exhibitions were a watershedfor them, an unforgettable academic experience.<p>        Well aware of what they had accomplished, these students hada solid grasp of the difference between understanding material indepth and memorizing facts for a test. Every single student agreedthat knowing one canto well was not only worth the effort but alsomade it easier to understand and appreciate other facets of thebook. They had learned how to do something, and those techniqueswere applicable to other reading. Dennis compared working on theseexhibitions with typical assignments: "Usually, when I read a bookfor school, I have to read it like a textbook, but when I wasworking on my exhibition, I could read Dante like a real book."<p>        These successes did not come without stress, however. On theone hand, the students felt abandoned, left to their own devices.Yet, this abandonment is what ultimately enabled them to enjoytaking intellectual risks, to realize that they knew how to readdifficult material, and to own their own learning. Kate describedthe process of becoming self-reliant:<p>        I found that it was really difficult to find [major ideaslike symbols, language, and sin] on my own. When they had beenpointed out to me before, I kind of thought, "Oh, yeah, that'sobvious," but the whole feeling is different when you are sittingthere at the library without a teacher who is going to tell you theanswer eventually. You sit there and sit there and struggle withthe words. "What the hell is the central image? What the hell isthe central image?" screams in your head. And it doesn't hit yousuddenly the way it does in class when someone tells you theanswer. You go through hours of trial and error. Finally the ideabegins to form and slowly you begin to find the proof of your ideain the canto, and you feel very smart.<p>        It was scary to assume this kind of responsibility. "Duringthe exhibition," David recalled, "there was nothing to hide behind.When you write a paper or take a test, you disappear. In front ofthe class, you had to be responsible for what you said."<p>        The students were also aware that they went much deeper intothe material. No matter how well Margaret taught a canto in onefifty-minute period, the student pair could understand it on a muchdeeper level after working for seven class periods and manyevenings. Besides, if they did not "get it" right away, they knewthey had the time to work through their confusion word by word,line by line, page by page, until they realized success. Jenreflected that "I didn't feel I needed to find a right answer. Iwasn't afraid of wrong answers. It became easier to trust my ownperceptions." Thus, getting the gist of a canto no longer sufficed;the students knew that they were not finished until they couldexplain every line, every word.<p>        This appreciation for depth affected the class discussions.Joanna explained: Before, you could make one good point during aclass and that was enough, but you didn't have to follow it throughto get the whole idea. [With the exhibition] enough time elapsedfor ideas to settle subconsciously, so I kept getting deeper andmore clarified under-standings of this one canto. I found this amuch more valuable experience than the first method where new ideaswere raised each day. Though themes were constant, I was neverallowed to dwell on them in relation to just one canto.<p>        Many of the students wrote about this experience in theircollege application essays, claiming that it was the mostsignificant learning experience in their high school years. Lisawrote:<p><i> I will admit that I have probably never beenso terrified in my life, but I came out of it witha greater understanding of  <i>The Inferno</i>, andmuch more self-confidence. I think this should definitely replacean exam. I know (from experience) that studying for an exam ismemorizing facts but not necessarily knowing. The exhibition ismuch more difficult but I think it's definitely worth the effort.</i><p>        Doing this exhibition made the students much more aware ofwhat it takes to teach and learn. They could identify their ownstrengths and weaknesses in these roles, and they developed self-assurance and pride in their capacities to meet these challenges.<p><hr><h2>Unexpected Problems</h2><hr>        Given the intricacies -and the relative novelty -of exhibitions,there is potential for a lot to go wrong. While what occurred inMargaret's class-room was positive and exciting, the response of thelarger school community revealed some unexpected conflicts.        In many ways, using exhibitions was a political choice forMargaret. Her department has done innovative work on curriculum butalmost no work on assessment, and she wanted other teachers andadministrators to have the opportunity to see this method. If onlysubconsciously, Margaret hoped that what she was doing might insome way influence her colleagues.<p>        Unfortunately, her actions made some of her colleagues,particularly those who are not committed to the need for change,uncomfortable and even angry. From their perspective, Margaret'suse of exhibitions was more a criticism of their work than thebeginning of a provocative conversation. Even though her intentionswere to push other faculty members, whom she admires and respects,to think about alternative assessment strategies, Margaret feltthat teachers saw her as a show-off, grandstanding her teaching tothe administrators.<p>        To Margaret's surprise, much trouble resulted from herdecision to ask administrators into her classroom as judges.Because of the contentious nature of the ongoing contract dispute,some teachers felt that it was inappropriate to ask foradministrators' time or to invite them into her classroom. Margaretfelt that this reaction was based on a larger philosophicaldisagreement about the relationship between administrators andteachers: while Margaret feels that the knowledge administratorsgain from observing real classes should drive the school, hercritics believe that individual classrooms represent academicfreedom and independence and that administrative positions should bemanagerial only. Such a conflict could be avoided if an entireschool agreed on exhibitions, but Margaret was alone in her effortsto implement this assessment technique. Never expecting thishostile reaction, Margaret was quite shaken by it.<p>        The political and personal ramifications of these exhibitionsunderscore how difficult innovation can be. One teacher's attemptsto try something different engendered a strong -and negative Ñreaction from the larger school. Instead of spawning fruitfuldiscussion, Margaret's work created an atmosphere of frustrationand mistrust. Yet, the fact that the exhibitions did elicit a verypowerful reaction is significant in itself. In schools that arewilling to look carefully at themselves, Margaret's efforts mightdrive substantive reflection about teaching and learning that couldlead to school-wide change.<p><hr><h2>Some Keys to Success</h2><hr>Exhibitions are risky. Tests are easier, more controllable (and farduller). In exhibitions, the teacher sets the final destination,shows the students the map, and invites them to have a splendidjourney. Safe passage, however, depends on setting certain groundrules.<p>        <b>Students must buy into the idea of an exhibition.</b> If studentsthink the whole process is just a useless exercise for the teacher,they can sabotage the project by trivializing the material or doingshoddy work. Students may think that any "creative" activity isacademically legitimate.<p>        <b>Students must assume responsibility for theirown learning. </b> A well-structured exhibition often depends on astudent-directed classroom. The students must be willing to findthe answers themselves (even if the teacher already knows them).Discovering meaning takes persistence and patience. So much of highschool feels like an intellectual charade to the students. Whenthey are given the chance to do difficult work, students aresurprised at the pleasure that comes from real intellectualachievement.<p>        <b>Students must share the workload, </b>out of respect for theirpartners as well as themselves. In this particular project, onlyone person felt that he had done too much of the work. All theothers wrote glowingly of their shared partnership. Given theimportance of collaboration, it seems worth it to switch partnerswho do not get along early in the process. With two pairs whosquabbled incessantly, Margaret decided it was better to admit anerror in placement and make a switch than to force the students tospend the bulk of their time working out their differences insteadof working on their exhibitions.<p>        <b>The teacher must prepare students adequately.</b> Exhibitions askstudents to use previously learned skills and content in newsituations. Therefore, teachers must first teach a knowledge base,and they must then also teach the skills needed to apply thisknowledge. Because the focus for the student changes from acquiringinformation to applying knowledge, the focus for the teacher mustalso change accordingly. However, the teacher is still required toset and explain the standards of academic excellence.<p>        <b>The teacher must make sure that the steps are clear.</b> Ifstudents are going to work independently, they must be taught howto proceed. At the same time, there should be enough leeway forstudents to explore other territory by themselves. Getting thiscombination right is tricky and relies heavily on a teacher'sknowledge of her students as well as her managerial skills.<p>        <b>The teacher must maintain the role of coach.</b> Although a coachcan explain the rules, teach the skills, and lead the practices,the students must play the game themselves. To this end, theteacher must not interrupt a poor or inaccurate presentation. Doingso would either provide a safety net or take ultimateresponsibility away from the student. Providing a safety net mightrescue a student on the verge of tears, but it also infantilizesthe student and signals to the other students that ultimately theteacher is in charge.<p>        <b>Most importantly, exhibitions must be rigorous. </b>Otherwise,they will seem shallow, irrelevant, or cute.Standards for exhibitions must be much higher than thosefor written tests; so much more is at stake here. A good exhibitionrequires collaboration, risk-taking, thoughtfulness, in-depth work,commitment, sustained effort, and original work. In a strongexhibition, the students will learn to respect academic excellence.<p><hr><h2>References</h2><hr>The Exhibitions Project.

Eibell, Thayer High School<br>Winchester, New Hampshire</center></h3><center>October, 1993</center><hr><p><i>The Coalition of Essential Schools gratefully acknowledgesthe IBM Corporationfor its support of research on Exhibitions.<p>The author wishes to thank the Zenith Team elders,Jean Kennedy, Tom McGuire And Mike Brown,for their generous contributions to her work.</i><p><hr>	Most educators who bought into the restructuring effort knew that the beginning stages of change would be challenging but feasible. School change strategies such as site-based management, team teaching, integration of subject matter, and the implementation of an advisory system, although quite drastic in their effects on school design, were attainable in relatively short periods of time. <p>	Developing authentic assessments, or exhibitions, called for a longer process. From the outset, at workshops and symposiums of the Coalition of Essential Schools, we at Thayer High School listened with interest as Grant Wiggins and Art Powell introduced us to an alternative way of looking at assessment, a divergence from absolute dependency on paper and pencil objective or essay tests. They visualized exhibitions of knowledge and skills relevant to students' own lives. This, we agreed, would be the most tedious and perplexing process in the school-change effort. <p>	For us at Thayer, it has never been less than that, but it has also been an experience that has given rise to a great deal of teacher, student, and parent discussion. The process has given us a clearer vision of why we are here, what we are providing for our students, and where we expect them to go. The purpose of this article is to report on Thayer's progress in the development of an assessment plan and to share samples of authentic exhibitions from our school.<p><hr><h2>Building  on Early Lessons</h2><hr>	Last summer Thayer's assessment committee took some positive steps in creating an assessment policy that makes sense to students, teachers, and parents. For several years we had struggled to define broad categories of skillsÑliteracy, expression, ethics/ values, personal proficiency, problem-solving, and cultural awarenessÑthat would avoid delineation as subject-specific skills, but rather would cross disciplines.1 We found that method to be too cumbersome, especially since we were at the same time developing curriculum around the integration of subject material. It was too easy for an anxious staff to place too much responsibility for documenting the exhibition of these skills on the senior class or subject-specific teachers. <p> 	The result was that we weren't collaborating and working together to devise a system that led to the exhibition of skills applicable to all subjects and teachers, thereby consulting teacher to teacher, department to department, to begin the tasks of defining criteria and setting standards. Our fragmented efforts led to new questions. Beyond our concern for who would assess the skills under each category, we also were not sure when and how they would be assessed: formatively, cumulatively, or summatively? Furthermore, how would the work be documentedÑvia portfolio, in a file, on disk, or on videotape? <p> 	What followed was a move toward establishing the nineteen Thayer High School graduation skills which now guide our assessment plan (see box below). These skills are attainable across the curriculum. Where our earlier attempts at outcome definition were too broad to be useful, these nineteen graduation skills reflect specific real-world realities. Our conversations with college professors, admission counselors, and managers from local businesses provided enough information for us to plunge into the creation of a plan that would clearly identify skills we expect graduates to demonstrate by the time they graduate from Thayer High School. A grant even provided coverage so teachers could "job-shadow" at a local workplace. The implementation of that plan would involve all teachers, students, and parents. The arena for the exhibition of these skills would be in all classes from grades seven through twelve. The judges would comprise all of the teachers. In short, we developed a plan that gives the responsibility and the proprietorship to all the stakeholders.<p> <hr><h2>The Plan: Graduation by Exhibition</h2><hr>	Commencing in grade seven, students and teachers submit demonstrative work to one of the nineteen files (one for each of the graduation skills) that are housed in cabinets in one of the team classrooms. As team teachers plan curriculum for the following school year, they provide many opportunities for students to work on these nineteen skills. As projects or assignments are designed, teachers indicate the skills which will be worked on to complete the task. When a student exhibits a graduation skill, the work is placed in that particular file. During the school year any teacher can submit a new piece of better quality, superseding the previous one. At the end of the year, students and advisors update the file by selecting the best piece of work in each skill area to remain in the file. The file is then forwarded to the next year's team. Although pieces from several subjects might be in the file at any given time, it is up to the advisor and advisee to choose which one stays. Should an advisor and advisee have difficulty in choosing which piece best demonstrates the skill, a standards committee for each skill will be available to help make that determination. <p> 	These files are also shared with the parents at conference days in November and April. Parents were not only happy to see examples of the work their children had done but also expressed great support that we were finally asking our students to be responsible for exhibiting what they were learning. This process also gives us an opportunity to share curriculum and outcomes with parents so that their fears and concerns about lack of continuity can be assuaged.<p> 	A plan such as this one is not immune from questions, concerns, and problems. Our task now is to grapple with these issues before we designate the first class to graduate by exhibition of skillsÑmost probably the 1993Ð94 ninth-grade class. On several occasions throughout the school year, we struggled with our concerns at faculty meetings. In departments, teams and in mixed groups, we defined our skills, suggested criteria by which they'd be judged, and then decided how that rubric would look. The same questions surfaced: Just what is good enough? Must the standard be the same for all students at Thayer? How often must it be demonstrated? Are we all capable judges of the work? We brought samples of work to the table and watched taped exhibitions. We argued, we got frustrated, and we protected our own domains and disciplines. What resulted was an incredibly reflective exercise. The wisdom we attained was how important it is to hold in high esteem, at all times, what we value for our students to learn and be able to demonstrate. <p> 	We aren't quite sure if there is any final answer to the questions of what are the criteria and the standards. We are aware, though, that as the assessors of our students' work, we might have a tendency to be too "warm" and "cozy" as we evaluate their presentations.2 After all, we want them to achieve, and if they've been diligent, committed, and hardworking, how can we say it's not good enough? If we fall into the habit of too much "warm" assessment, our standards will never stand on their own. Therefore, we must constantly collaborate within and outside of the school to find that level of achievement.<p> <hr><h2>Zenith: The Eleventh Grade Projects</h2><hr>	Thayer's eleventh-grade interdisciplinary team is made up of an English, economics, and social studies teacher who endearingly call themselves "the Elders." The guiding principle of "student as worker" is evident on any given day in the eleventh-grade classrooms, which are contiguous within the building. We are most proud of the team's ability to integrate subject material, develop curriculum around essential themes and questions, and call for exhibitions that indeed assess what has been taught. In fact, because my daughter was a student on this team, I learned in a very personal way the epitome of integrated curriculum. One evening, as Kari was writing an assignment at the computer I asked her, "For which class are you doing this assignment?" She looked at me with all seriousness and said, "For team." Thinking she had not understood me, I clarified myself by asking, "I mean for which subject?" She impatiently reiterated, "For team. We don't separate like that." <p> 	In our process of developing exhibitions, we keep two things in mind: 1) to validate that we are assessing what we teach and want students to learn, and 2) to provide opportunities to demonstrate the acquisition of our nineteen graduation skills. To use the metaphor of "planning backwards,"3 the exhibition drives the curriculum. Along the road to the exhibition, our students should engage in rigorous investigation as well as develop good habits of mind, both of which are reflected in the graduation skills. The true challenge comes when team members attempt to design curriculum that is personal and conducive to an "authentic" assessmentÑan exhibition. Let's see how this plays out on the eleventh-grade team. <p> 	The yearly eleventh-grade theme is "Highways Beyond Thayer: An American Journey." The essential question for the second quarter is "The Road Less Traveled: What are the Minority Voices?" In the words of one of the Elders: "This is the Zenith. These quarterly projects are where we meet our course goals, explore subject matter, interact positively with classmates and Elders, research, use written and oral expression skills and, in most every way, accomplish the curriculum aims and graduation requirements for Thayer High."<p> 	Students on the Zenith team were challenged to answer the essential question by researching an issue around civil rights and minority voices and then exhibiting the results in one of several formats in a public forum:<p> <hr><h2>Exhibition Formats</h2> <hr><ul><li><b>Debate:</b> Conduct a cogent, well-researched debate of an issue centered around inequality or discrimination, including the role of the government.<p> <li><b>Play: </b>Produce a prepared or student-authored play based on an event or issue. Must be based on historical, social, emotional, and economic facts.<p> <li><b>Speech Recitation and Biography:</b> Present a person who represents a minority voice.<p> <li><b>Map, Pictorial Display and Timeline:</b> Chart Civil War battles or civil rights demonstrations on an accurate and permanent final product.Bronx Regional High School Exchange: Plan and implement a student exchange. Group acceptance dependent upon the completion of an essay of application that states why you feel you are a good candidate to represent Thayer.</ul><p> 	Much to the Elders' surprise and some disappointment, no students chose to do a debate, play, or recitation. They wondered whether students had chosen the map and Bronx exchanges because they thought they would be less work. No problem. The Elders set out to outline clear criteria for the exhibition for each project.<p> <hr><h2>Healthy Disorganization</h2><hr>	For six weeks the junior space was a hub of activity. Students worked on their exhibitions during second through fourth periods each day. Many visitors watched in awe at the engagement of the students as they worked individually and in groups to organize their projects. Some teachers said they could never work in such chaos nor turn over so much instructional time to the students. We at Thayer like to refer to it as a healthy disorganizationÑan atmosphere which gives students every opportunity to investigate an area of personal interest around an essential question, while at the same time working on exhibiting the nineteen graduation skills. <p> 	The daily three-hour block of time might begin with the call for who would go to the lumber yard, to the town library, to the school library for CD-ROM, by car-pool to the Keene State University library, to the office to make phone calls to arrange for the Bronx exchange trip, to the industrial arts room to cut plywood for the maps or to stay in the classroom to begin compiling the information.<p> 	Throughout the six-week period, each student was required to attend one five-hour seminar in each of the academic subjects, exploring contributions each discipline can make: English, economics and history. In English, contemporary short stories in the voices of minority groups that have been discriminated against in society and in the literary canon were read and discussed. The main focus of the economics seminar was to research the issues of economic inequalities and economic discrimination. In history, a sampler of America's struggle with civil rights was presented. For the remainder of the project time, teachers were available as resources and coaches to ensure that the quarterly exhibitions were completed and ready for presentation at Parents Night. The Elders were steadfast in their commitment not only to assess the final product but also to assess the ongoing process and general work habits. This was not always easy with so many students coming and going. <p> 	An example from one morning's agenda reads:<p> The work so far this quarter has been of excellent quality overall; however, it is somewhat spotty in its regularity. There are still about five weeks left in the quarter to pull things together, so don't despair. We need some suggestions as to how to utilize the time after seminars. To some people, the 10:30Ð11:32 time has become an elongated break with little obvious attention being paid to the many complex tasks at hand.<p> And a few days later:<p> Now zoom ahead into reality! Many of you look cozy and quite content. For that we are grateful; however, that is not the aim of our time allocation. The Elders routinely discuss the repeat offenders, and the lack of action will be reflected in your evaluation. Unless today is a marked improvement over yesterday, not only may you fail your Quarterly Project class grade, but you will also receive a massive amount of coal in your stocking.<p><hr><h2>Sink or Swim</h2><hr>	Shortly after winter break, panic set in. Two more components to the projects were still to be completed: the planning and implementation of Parents Night and the scheduling of the oral defense. For Parents Night, each group or individual was required to present their product to the people in attendance. A detailed description of the creation process and project representation had to be prepared. Also, in our constant effort to have students go deeper with the subject matter and for us to ascertain what exactly they've learned, the Elders requested that each student pose an essential question around his or her project work that would be answered in an oral defense to the Elders. <p> 	By this time we were observing a sink-or-swim situation. Another example from a morning agenda: <p> So much is happening! The creating, the collaboration and discussions, are great to witness and take part in. The few people who are doing little are embarrassingly conspicuous. There is almost a magic transformation which can take place at this point in a huge project. The maps are being drawn, the research is taking shape, and the reservations for the trip are being finalized. All of us, including the Elders, need to be reminded that you all are doing the work. The Bronx trip is happening because enough of you wanted to experience life as it happens, not from a book. The maps and displays are taking on a life of their own because, to a large degree, you all had the choice of what you wanted to do as you immerse yourselves in a subject which touches us all in some way - discrimination. We all believe that you will produce lasting exhibits and artifacts from which others who follow you can learn.<p> 	The arrival of exhibitions week brought both a sense of pride and sighs of relief. Thayer administrators, faculty, and the student body meandered throughout the junior classrooms to hear presentations and see the exhibits. Most were impressed with the interest level and depth of understanding of the projects. Most important were the supportive comments received at Parents Night. Several parents talked about how overwhelmed they felt at seeing their children speak so eloquently and with profound interest about their projects. Their own experiences in school had been quite traditional, with teachers as the givers of information and students the passive receptors. Here their children had proposed what they wanted to learn, devised a plan of investigation, and planned and executed a well-prepared exhibition of what they had learned.<p> <hr><h2>Standards and Lingering Questions</h2><hr>	The question about how much they really did learn will continue to haunt us. Perhaps there are no absolute answers. To me it was an eclectic experience from which learning came from all parts of the process. There were valuable lessons learned from the simplest measurement of plywood for the maps to the development of essential questions for the oral challenge. From a Zenith Team Elder:<p> The level of true understanding of the subjects researched is absolutely astounding. Of course, an entire group can probably never agree on one system of learning, as one system never fits everyone's learning styles (for this reason we created the seminars this quarter). According to what we have been hearing from many of you, this project has worked for you. The knowledge many of you have attained through learning it yourselves rather than being "taught" by us, is something that we should not dismiss easily. It is doubtful that, in a more standard setting, a book would have imparted quite the feeling that actually visiting the Bronx did. It is doubtful that many of you would have stayed awake long enough to hear me TELL you about the ebb and flow of the Civil War.<p> 	For the future, we are confident that our nineteen graduation skills will drive the curriculum that culminates with in-depth exhibitions. We strive to engage in an ongoing dialogue between staff, students, and parents as to what we should teach, how we should teach, and what we expect our students to learn. <p> 	Dr. Dennis Littky, Thayer's principal, sums it up best:<p> I always find that the teachers who empower students the most and who get the students the most excited about learning are the ones who are ready to give up teaching certain facts and who are willing to follow the students. Then they can push, cajole, help students go further. But until learning becomes real and built on action, it will be fake.<p> <hr><h2>Figure One:Thayer High School Graduation Skills</h2><hr><p><ol>	<li>	Applying scientific concepts	<li>	Distinguishing between evidence and opinion	<li>	Interpreting data and graphs	<li>	Reading comprehension	<li>	Problem solving	<li>	Understanding the consequences of technology and development on society and the environment	<li>	Organization	<li>	Research	<li>	Oral expression	<li>	Written expression	<li>	Starting and finishing multi-faceted projects	<li>	Cooperation	<li>	Comparing and contrasting information	<li>	Applying measurement	<li>	Applying mathematics	<li>	Using technology as a tool	<li>	Independent learning	<li>	Formulating essential questions	<li>	Participating as a citizen</ol><p><hr><h2>Figure Two:Exhibitions Requirements</h2><hr><h3>Map Project</h3><ol><li>	<b>Timeline: </b>A detailed timelinethat specifies economic and historical events, facts, people,places, inventions, literature, art,etc. This time-line will cover theperiod or periods depicted by your map.<p> <li><b>	Pictorial Display: </b>Scrapbook/textbook and/or accompanying collage capturingcultural expressions of the time covered.

<html><head><title>CES: Publications: Research Papers: Exhibitions: Facing Outward, Pointing Inward</title></head><body><h1><center>Exhibitions: Facing Outward, Pointing Inward</center></h1>     <hr><h3><center>by Joseph P. McDonald, Coalition of Essential Schools</h3>November, 1991</center><hr><p><i>The Coalition of Essential Schools gratefully acknowledgesthe IBM Corporationandthe UPS Foundationfor their support of its research on Exhibitions.<p>The Exhibitions work at Sullivan and English high schools,briefly described in this article, is more fully explored inGraduation by Exhibition: Assessing Genuine Achievementby Joseph McDonald, Sidney Smith,Dorothy Turner, Marian Finney & Eileen Barton(Alexandria, VA: Association of Supervision & Curriculum Development,1992).</i><p><hr>        It is an old American habit to imagine utopia in the abstract,then search for the instrument -the policy, the remedy, thetechnology -that might yield it up quickly. But it is just as old anAmerican habit to start more concretely -with images of a Black manvoting, of an Appalachian child eating, of a woman fire-fighter working-then strive, over the long haul, to connect these images and bringthem to life.<p>        When it comes to the utopian prospect of creating new schoolsfor the twenty-first century, we in the Coalition of Essential Schoolstry hard to stick to the second path. Our reason is as pragmatic as itis principled: in school reform, the first path generally offers afool's journey (Cohen & Ball, 1990; Elmore & McLaughlin, 1988).1 So,for example, the quick instruments of the 1980s -longer school daysand years, more testing of teachers and kids, more course requirementsfor high schools -seem to have made things worse (Brown, 1991; Timar& Kirp, 1989). Meanwhile, the patient striving of some of the originalmembers of the Coalition of Essential Schools -a creature as well ofthe 1980s -has turned scanty images of possibility into remarkableschools. These are schools that scout the future -schools likeDeborah Meier's Central Park East Secondary School in New York Cityand Dennis Littky's Thayer High School in Winchester, New Hampshire(Wood, 1992).<p>        Now, at the start of the 1990s, the lure of the quicker pathagain threatens the capacity of policymakers to focus on the longhaul. Thus our schools face a number of proposals that mean to driveinstruction. These proposals all involve assessment, and sometimeswhat is called alternative or authentic assessment. Their proponentssuggest that clever instruments might be capable of directing schoolstoward worthy ends -yielding in a stroke the utopia of excellence andequity that many of us seek. Give schools the right test, so theargument goes, and the other elements of new school design will alignlike metal filaments to a magnet.<p>        Unfortunately, the argument is more attractive than persuasive.It ignores the fact that schools are exceedingly complex organisms,responsive only in perverse ways to outside driving. This isespecially true when the driver aims to enhance accountability(Madaus, 1985; Darling-Hammond and Ascher, 1991). Real accountabilitydepends in the end on the resolution of school people to awaken to theeffects of regularities that suppress their own best instincts, tocome to terms with what Theodore R. Sizer (1990) has called the"essential dailiness of school" -its numbing habit of self-absorptionand its preoccupation with simply churning on. One cannot be driven tosuch mindfulness; one can only be coached into it. Assessment can playan important role in the effort, but only if it aims to point outcontinually what schools might otherwise overlook to the detriment oftheir real mission. What is wanted is an assessment system perchedpowerfully within the school itself and just above the school's othersystems -one that from its perch might direct these other systemstoward kids rather than toward their own smooth running. This is whatthe Coalition of Essential Schools means by exhibitions.<p>        Ted Sizer (1984, 1992) reached all the way back to theeighteenth century in search of an assessment mechanism that mightfunction in this way. He found at least the possibility of it in aubiquitous feature of the early American academies and of the commonschools that shared their era. The exhibition, as practiced then, wasan occasion of public inspection when some substantial portion of aschool's constituency might show up to hear students recite, declaim,or otherwise perform.2 The constituency might thereby satisfy itselfthat the year's public funds or tuitions had been well spent and thatsome cohort of young scholars was now ready to move on or out. Thereis evidence that this satisfaction came cheap. Arthur Powell, who hasstudied the matter, once told me that the exhibition as practiced inits own time was frequently little more than public entertainment Ñthe equivalent of Friday night football in Odessa, Texas. WayneFuller's (1982, p. 212) account captures the flavor:<p>"Through the years the rural people responded to these exhibitions withenthusiasm. On cold winter evenings, at Christmas time or at the closeof the winter term of school, when the snow still blanketed theschoolyard, they crowded into the little schoolhouse and watched theirchildren perform by the light of the kerosene lamps that cast shadowsand an almost eerie orange light about the room. And for the schoolpicnic and exhibition that closed the spring term of school, theybrought an abundance of food to the schoolhouse or the grove of treesby the river for the noonday meal and prepared to spend the daytalking to their neighbors and watching the exhibition in theafternoon."<p>        For his part, Sizer imagined this old design in something morecontemporary than kerosene light; still, he prized its history andaimed to use it to help displace more recent historical influences onthe design of the American high school. These are especially the onesthat have lent the high school its division of knowledge intosubjects, time into Carnegie units, and kids into tracks (Sizer, 1984,1992; Powell, Farrar, & Cohen, 1985; Hampel, 1986). Features of theexhibition, as Sizer projected them, run counter to these powerfulnorms: a suggestion that high school kids, like doctoral students,might qualify for graduation on the basis of some integrativeperformance; that they might attempt this performance when they werewell enough prepared to attempt it, rather than on some fixedschedule; and that they might all be required to do it well, withoutregard to someone's perception of their abilities, career prospects,or socio-economic status. Together with a number of imaginative schoolpeople -like Meier, Littky, and Samuel Billups (of Walbrook HighSchool, Baltimore, Maryland), to name a few of the pioneers of themid-1980s -and scholars like Arthur Powell (1986) and Grant Wiggins(1988), Sizer launched a theoretical and practical adventure withexhibitions that continues today in the Coalition of EssentialSchools.<p><hr><h2>Exhibitions and Accountability</h2><hr>        The exhibition is a device with two related functions -onefacing outward and the other pointing inward. It yields accountabilityin the terms that Linda Darling-Hammond and Carol Ascher (1991)promote: accountability as the product of commitments, policies, andpractices designed to press kids toward meaningful achievement and tofeed back whatever information the school needs to ensure the successit intends. So the exhibition at its best aims to answer two complexlyintertwined questions: What can these kids do now that I've taughtthem? What can I learn from what they show me?<p><hr><h3>Facing Outward</h3><hr>        There is no more powerful agent of accountability than kidsthemselves -performing live more or less as the school intended thatthey should. But this power of live performance depends on having alocal audience to assess the rich information it yields, an audiencethat consists of more than the individual teacher in the privacy ofhis or her classroom. When kids must show what they know and what theyhave learned in face-to-face meetings with those who have not taughtthem but who share an interest in their success, then a certain pitchof accountability can be reached that otherwise is never possible. Ofcourse, accountability systems must transcribe performance into scoresor other notation, so that kids' progress may be followed over timeand so that others who cannot attend live performances may be informedof kids' standing. But today, most accountability systems provide thetranscription without any access to the performance for which it issupposed to stand. One consequence of this is that some among thepublic come to suspect that the tran-scription may be groundless.<p>        According to the annual Gallup poll of Americans' attitudestoward schooling (Elam, Rose & Gallup, 1991), most who are suspiciousin this way exempt their own school from the suspicion, and so thepolitics of accountability tend to collect at the state and nationallevels rather than at the local one. Yet a closer reading of the mostrecent poll suggests that this exemption is at best an ambivalent one.It is true that 42 percent of respondents assigned the grade of A or Bto their local public schools, while only 21 percent assigned thesegrades to the public schools nationally. Meanwhile, however, awhopping 81 percent would impose national achievement standards andgoals on their local schools, 77 percent would require them to usestandardized national tests to assess their community's kids, and 68percent would have their local schools follow a national curriculum.If there is so much local satisfaction, how come these other figures?My answer is that most local communities trust their local educators Ñurban communities notably excepted -but nonetheless yearn forreassurance in such uncertain times. In the Coalition of EssentialSchools, we think this reassurance may best be supplied by means ofpublic access to live performance. Exhibitions can provide suchaccess.3 When they do, we say that they face outward.<p>        Of course, the politics of accountability (including the demandsfor national testing, national curriculum, and so on) are fueled bymore than local concerns. An important factor too is the (well-founded) suspicion on other levels that many local schools and,indeed, many local communities have at best an inchoate sense oftwenty-first-century standards. Some schools and communities clearlystill care more that their kids spell well or memorize the list ofstate capitals than that they acquire intellectually powerful habitsof mind. This fact -clearly not in the national interest -emboldenssome critics, scholars, and policymakers to suggest that real localneeds -as contrasted with perceived ones -may indeed be betterattended to on some "higher" than local level.<p>        In the Coalition of Essential Schools, however, we object tothis conclusion on both ethical and political grounds. To us, it seemsright to begin the work of ratcheting up expectations on the locallevel, since expectations are invariably entangled with values, andvalues legitimately vary somewhat from one American community toanother. It may also be politically prudent, since these values oftenvary in explosively political ways. Moreover, if we are right aboutthe sub-stantial role played in the politics of accountability by localyearning for it -if, indeed, people do want to see their kids'achievement for them-selves, despite their apparent satisfaction withlocal schools -then they will be no more satisfied by individualprofiles from a redesigned National Assessment of Educational Progress(NAEP) or by criterion-based scores on a voluntary national exam orstate-scored portfolio than they are satisfied now by report cards andLake Wobegon statistics.<p>        This is not to deny that parents also want to know how theirkids stack up against other kids within the school, in the next townor state, even in other countries. Nor is it to argue against newroles for NAEP or against other national assessment efforts or statemonitoring and moderating. Sensible accountability policy for the1990s and beyond may well require imaginative expansion in each ofthese areas, and it must come to terms with what I would argue are theextraordinarily comparative concerns of this generation of parents.4On the other hand, attention to these things can easily diminishaccountability rather than enhance it. This will happen especially ifattention to individual student assessment displaces all attention tothe quality of schools' efforts to press for achievement and if localschools are to be perceived as the mere collectors of accountabilitydata rather than as the heart of the accountability system (Darling-Hammond and Ascher, 1991).<p>        By contrast, in the Coalition of Essential Schools we imagine anationwide accountability that is rooted in local efforts to presshard and to take stock, supported and monitored by district and state,fed by perspectives on achievement and equity that are developed andrefined on the national level. Such a system would require of eachschool that it open itself to inspection, report annually to itscommunity like a corporation to its stockholders, disclose what allits indicators of achievement reveal. These indicators should includenot only common measures like attendance and drop-out rates andcomparative achievement data, but uncommon ones like longitudinalindicators of achievement and the living evidence of the school'scurrent candidates for graduation showing their stuff in exhibitionsand standing for public examination.<p><hr><h3>Pointing Inward</h3><hr>        Besides helping schools face outward, exhibitions at their best alsopoint inward. Darling-Hammond and Ascher (1991) assert thataccountability depends ultimately not only on a school'sresponsiveness to its constituencies but also on its capacity togenerate and act upon information regarding its own inner workings.Some schools within the Coalition of Essential Schools have recentlydis-covered the power of exhibitions in this respect. Prominent amongthese are the schools that approached restructuring from the "end"rather than the "front."<p>        While many member schools have tied their innovations to apioneer cohort moving ahead grade by grade or to a pilot projectdesigned to get the kinks out of a structural innovation and thenexpand it, "end-first" schools have often dared to establishexhibition systems right away. These systems vary in design fromschool to school -creatures of the institutional forces, histories,and personalities that have built them. But in each case, they offerthe school more than a showcase for outcomes. They also offer aperspective, previously unavailable, on the systems that producedthese outcomes of an innovation. And they offer a means for the schoolto take stock. One can think of them as a kind of platform -one thatserves as a stage for student performance and, in another respect, asa school's lookout on its own systems. By means of such platforms,schools may see the real effects of their current work and also adjustthe work's dynamics so as to ensure better effects in the future. TheCoalition calls this process "planning backwards," which is to say,orienting a school by the compass of its graduates' performance(McDonald, 1991).<p><hr><h2>Two Platforms for Planning Backwards</h2><hr>        One member of the Coalition, Sullivan High School in Chicago, requiresthat all its seniors (152 last year) demonstrate their ability toengage thoughtfully with difficult texts by participating successfullyin a ninety-minute seminar on several such texts, then writing anacceptable essay on the ideas embedded in the texts. This is theplatform. Its construction owes much to the influence on the school ofMortimer Adler's (1982) Paideia Proposal.5 It has a simple design, butone that has had more than an additive impact on the rest of theschool's structures. For one thing, the whole faculty is involved inleading the seminars and scoring the seniors' participation, incoaching the seniors during the two weeks they have to grapple withsuch texts as Freud's "Why War?" and Thucydides' "Melian Dialogue,"and in scoring the essays. Thus, the whole faculty feels pressure tounderstand the scoring rubrics and the pedagogy that underlies themand to practice this pedagogy in their classes regardless of grade andsubject.<p>        Initially, this pedagogy was widely practiced only in theschool's Paideia Impact Program - a magnet program within the largerschool. In insisting on the establishment of the schoolwide seminar-exhibition, Principal Robert Brazil in effect mandated the extensionof this program schoolwide. He entrusted the implementation of themandate, however, to an influential group of teachers. The consequencewas that the mandate stimulated rather than quashed professionalesteem. So far, the effort has led to peer-training mechanisms inseminar-based and writing instruc-tion, to scheduling changes thatallow weekly double blocks for seminars and team-teaching, to newforums for school governance, to more experimentation with coaching asa method of teaching, and to design efforts aimed at requiring asenior project in math and science to complement the senior seminar.<p>        Another school in the Coalition, Boston's English High School,designed a different platform, the product of what might be called theprincipal's epiphany. Sid Smith found himself one graduation dayhanding out diplomas to several kids who he knew could not adequatelyread and write, but who had nonetheless completed graduation require-ments. The next year, he and the faculty instituted a new graduationrequirement: in addition to earning a certain number of coursecredits, every senior must write a "position paper" that demonstratesa capacity to think through a complex issue, back up an opinion withreasoning and reference, and do it in writing that is persuasive andfree of error.<p>        From this simple platform English High has learned to see itselfmore clearly and to wonder productively about what it sees. Why is itthat some kids formerly graduated without being able to do what theposition paper demands? How often in ninth-grade courses, for example,are kids required to take positions and defend them orally and inwriting? How much classroom time is instead dominated by teachers'talking and kids' one-word responses to their questions?<p>        This seeing and wondering have led to a number of changes,present and prospective: peer-training mechanisms again, greatercollaboration across subjects and grades, introduction of coachingmechanisms to supplement direct and whole-class instruction, andexploration of emerging technology to provide students richer and moreindependent access to information. Another result has been someelaboration of the original platform: the addition of a "defense" tothe paper requirement, the addition of earlier paper requirements ateach grade level, attempts to introduce quantitative thinking into thepapers and the defenses, a design effort aimed at supplementing thepaper requirement with various project requirements.<p>        It is important to note that exhibitions worked no magic ineither of these cases: these platforms were designed to be instrumentsof leadership, not salvation. It is also important to note that thisleadership originated with the principals in both cases but soonbecame collective.<p><hr><h2>What Exhibitions Point To</h2><hr>        Exhibitions that sit on such good platforms as the two describedabove tend to point to or highlight five different dimensions ofschool life, each of which constitutes a crucial arena for schoolreform.<p><hr><h3>Results and Goals</h3><hr>        First and fundamentally, exhibitions like the two above point toresults, the live results of kids performing -a record more startlingin its impact than letters on a transcript or deviations from the normof a standardized achievement test. The tonic is bracing for anenterprise used to indecipherable effects, one tuned more to processthan product. Inattentive to live results, schools adjust easily tothe grip of their own running on, where what matters most is to keepmoving, where achieve-ment is measured in time served. Confronted byresults, schools may reflect on the efficacy of the systems thatproduce these results.<p>        Next, and also fundamentally, exhibitions point to goals. Thisis also a bracing tonic. Although talk of goals typically fills manyhours of the professional education of teachers, goals in practice arecommonly secret and indistinct, as Powell (1986, p. 64) suggests:6<p>A certain vagueness about desired outcomes has been found useful byteachers for many different reasons. Individual teachers often havetheir own goals. Working on them privately is one dimension ofprofessional independence. Working on them collaboratively is oftenregarded as unwanted intrusiveness. Teachers, in addition, oftenresist too much "outcome specification" because of its reductionistimplications. They argue that, in general education as distinct fromskill training, the unpredictability of many outcomes is inevit-ableand desirable. Moreover, some fear that too much specification mightlead either to unacceptable failure rates or unacceptably low minimumstandards. Vagueness and individual autonomy regarding assessmentprevent these undesirable results.<p>        In the absence of professionally articulated goals, others slipin. These typically apply differentially to kids. The most salient forsome may be getting a "4" on the AP English exam and an admissionletter to Stanford, while those for peers down the hall may be getting"through" high school with minimal reading skills and no morepregnancy. Because exhibitions by design involve all the school'scandidates for graduation and occupy a sphere of school life apartfrom -though related to -patterns of instruction, they have a powerlittle evident elsewhere in high school to point out the intellectualshallowness of such aims as these, as well as the severe discrepancybetween them. They may prompt a school to ask itself what reallymatters -what all kids should know and be able to do to live well inthe American twenty-first century. One benefit of asking such a goodquestion is that it may well direct the questioner to the counsel ofinterested outsiders. In the best of circumstances, these will includenot only parents, partisans of local culture, and the local businesscommunity, but also those more remotely outside -scholars in thedisciplines, others with articulate views of the economic, cultural,political, and moral national interest.<p><hr><h3>Professional Development</h3><hr>        In pointing to results and goals, exhibitions implicitly alertus to the prevalence of the "fudge factor" in schooling, the tendencynot to worry about results and goals. The fudge factor is apredictable effect of the uncertainties that fill a teaching life andof a chronic habit within the discourse about schooling to discountthese uncertainties (Cohen, 1988; McDonald, 1992). Many speak aboutteaching as if teachers could and should work like technicians Ñdiagnosing problems, applying solutions. But this way of working isreally impossible in teaching, where so much depends upon thevolatility of interpersonal relations and the complexity of humanunderstanding.<p>        On the other hand, setting schoolwide goals, taking collectiveresponsibility to reach them, and honestly facing results are powerfulmeans for coping with uncertainty. But they are aspects of craftrather than of technology. They invite teachers to value teaching assomething more than the application of other people's inventions Ñindeed, to appreciate it as the workshop of their own inventions. Inan important sense, exhibitions may be said, therefore, to point tothe responsibility of every school to pursue the professionaldevelopment of its faculty within the fabric of school life ratherthan outside it. An exhibition platform may be said to work well tothe extent that its features provide teachers with opportunities, forexample, to collaborate with colleagues as well as outsiders in thedesign of prompts and scoring rubrics and other materials, tocollaborate also in the establishment and maintenance of standards,and to tinker as needed with the operating systems of the school. Asevery teacher knows who has ever enjoyed such oppor-tunities at work,these constitute the best professional development available.<p><hr><h3>Standards and New Ways of Teaching</h3><hr>        Schools that dare to set up platforms for exhibitions committhemselves to prepare all their students to perform upon theseplatforms in some manner that exceeds the ordinarily minimalist focusof the high school -where persistence alone counts most heavily. Infact, people associated with the Coalition of Essential Schools oftenspeak of exhibitions as "demonstrations of mastery." But what ismastery, after all? When is a particular performance good enough, andwhen is it not? And how can a school reliably equate "good enough"across the performances of many kids engaging many different tasksover the course of many years? These are questions of standards, andexhibitions invariably point them out.<p>        Schools that wrestle with standards typically begin by buildinginternal mechanisms for teachers to talk with each other about thequality of student work. This is a crucial first step, though it isnot enough by itself. The maintenance of high standards in school alsodepends on teachers' access and openness to outside exper-tise. Becausemany exhibition platforms insist that the student-exhibitors foragefor information and insight beyond school walls, the faculty thatjudges their work must be willing also to distrust the sufficiency ofinside resources -including the resources available from their ownprevious learning. So exhibitions may be said to point to a differentconception of teaching than that represented in the prevalent metaphorof teaching as the delivery-of-instruction.<p>        People in the Coalition often use the alternative metaphor ofteaching as coaching, but the word may be too familiar to do justiceto the sense I mean. Teachers who prepare kids to write positionpapers, for example, and who support them in the writing, must bethemselves prepared to function as orienteers to territories ofknowledge they know little or nothing about, as advisors to studentswhose chief intellectual mentors on particular projects are outsidersthe teacher does not even know, as experts on the process of knowingrather than on its sub-stance. Teachers who prepare students toundertake senior projects of significant scope and depth must learn toteach more frequently in ways that give even their youngest studentspractice in staking out and managing their own learning initia-tivesand in planning and performing whole routines. Trained and socializedin the pedagogy of the dole, teachers can have a hard time figuringout how to teach under these new circumstances -how to let go enoughwhile still providing safe boun-daries, how to help without directing,how to distinguish a timely intervention from a controlling one, andso on.<p><hr><h3>Nature of Knowledge and Learning</h3><hr>Exhibitions also tend to point to new conceptions of what knowledge isand of how minds may grasp it. Because exhibitions are integrativeacts, often calling upon a candidate for graduation to synthesize whathe or she has learned in more than one domain and put it to use, theyhighlight a view of knowledge as integrated perception, cognition, anduse. This view happens to coincide with that of contemporary learningtheorists as to how knowledge may best be acquired; that is, by activecontact with it in context and use. Resnick (1987), for example,argues that the legacy of early twentieth-century psychology indecomposing and decontextualizing knowledge for better delivery hashandicapped teachers and learners alike.<p>        The challenge of undoing this legacy, however, is daunting. Atissue is not just the organization of teaching into rational surveysand stepwise experience, but also the division of the curriculum intomutually exclusive subjects and the ten-dency of schools to ignorehabits and skills that transcend this division. At their best,exhibitions point all this out. To address the question "How pure isBaltimore's water?" (as one exhibitor at Walbrook High School recentlydid), one may reason-ably explore chemistry, engineering, biology,geology, politics, public health, public policy in general, and evenhistory, literature, philosophy, and the arts. And to address thequestion well, one will have to know how to do some things that arethe province of none of these subjects alone -for example, how to usea question like a searchlight and like a knife, how to keep track ofemerging insight, how to find out what you need from people and booksthat go way over your head, how to work your way out of intellectualand emotional cul-de-sacs, and so on.<p><hr><h3>Incentives and Means</h3><hr>        Having managed to pull together a vision of what it wishes itsstudents to become, the school that dares to plan backwards fromexhibitions must also consider how it can help these students makethat vision their own. In effect, the exhibition is a kind of compactby which school and student agree to work toward this vision. Itpoints the way. The way can hardly be found, however, unless thestudent shares the vision, sees what is pointed out. So the schoolmust confront some questions that most schools never confront: Howshould the school portray for kids what it hopes they will become? Howcan they ensure that such images will be compelling and empoweringrather than threatening? How much student voice will the school admitto the process of inventing and discussing these images? How can theschool ensure that the images honor rather than stigmatize difference?What benchmarks for growth should the school provide, and how can theybe provided so that kids will take them as encouraging rather thandiscouraging?<p>        Such questions arise outside the ordinary conception of schoolas a processing machine. They suggest an alternative conception inwhich schools and kids collaborate on the terms of their engagementwith each other. They also provoke healthy skepticism about thetraditional means of instruction. If what is wanted is kids who thinkthings through, write well, speak persuasively, act with confidence,work well with others, trust their intuitions, and so on, how muchpractice with these things can they gain by sitting silently in largegroups most of their days? So exhibitions point to other means Ñprojects, advisory groups, coaching groups, seminars, studios,workshops, school governance mechanisms, mentorships and apprenticeships outside the walls of the school, and so on.<p>        It just so happens that most of these other means implicitlyrequire that the school invent better custodial arrangements than theone prevalent now -the one that requires that kids sit continuouslyin small desks with a teacher's eye on them. Thus, exhibitionsultimately point schools toward a reconsideration of what SeymourSarason (1982) calls the "constitution" of schooling. This is perhapsthe most important pointing, the one that may, if we're lucky, give usgenuine school reform in the 1990s rather than some other false imageof it. As Sarason (1982, 1990) suggests, our persistent failure torestructure the power relations of schooling foretells our failure toachieve any other kind of meaningful restructuring. What we need areschools that are genuine communities where the authority to maintainnorms of personal and intellectual respect is diffusely shared andwhere habits of decency run deep.<p><hr><h2>References</h2><hr><dl><dd>Adler, M.

Cohen (1988, pp.53-54) suggests how such a difference in perspective may account forthe difference in approach:The early work calls for exploration of alternatives, invention ofmany forms knowing that only a few may succeed, experimentation, andcreation of examples that suggest the possibilities of change. . . .But at the end of a long revolution there is little time forexploration, experimentation, and invention.

The academiesoverall had some of the characteristics current radical choiceadvocates desire: a mingling of private and public funding, greatvarieties of aim and form, grassroots responsiveness to the "market"of their time, and a diverse clientele.

McDonald, Coalition of Essential Schools</center></h3><center>August, 1991</center><hr><p><i>The Coalition of Essential Schools gratefully acknowledges the IBM Corporation and the UPS Foundation for their support of its research on Exhibitions.</i><p><i>This article is a substantially revised versionof a paper presented at the annual meeting of theAmerican Educational Research Associationin Chicago, Illinois, April 1991.</i><p><hr>Mary McLeod Bethune High School,1 situated ina large American city, is a partner in the high school reformeffort launched by the Coalition of Essential Schools in 1984. TheCoalition advocates simple goals that apply to all students and arefocused on intellectual achievement. It also ad vocates a pedagogythat combines a personalized and caring environment with a focus onstudent production -"student as worker." Crucially, it argues for"graduation by exhibition," rather than as the consequence of timeserved in class. This phrase leads a double life in Coalitiondiscourse. It refers to a method of assessment, one that measuresvalued knowledge directly rather than indirectly; that demandsperformance, the application of knowledge, and metacognition; thathappens in some public setting; and that guards a gate tograduation. At the same time, the phrase also refers to theCoalition's own version of outcome-based education, an ideal ofschoolkeeping in which all systems are oriented toward producinggraduates in the image of the school's collective vision ofcompetent intellectual performance.<p>        The faculty at Bethune Essential School seeks to producegraduates who demonstrate imagination, power, confidence, andcompassion in intellectual matters; who communicate skillfully; whohave more than textbook knowledge of the major subjects they havestudied, but who can apply "content" to investigations of theimportant issues of their time. "Planning backwards" from thiscompelling image, the school's faculty have taught themselves toteach in interdisciplinary teams; they have given their studentsresponsibility, gotten to know them well, asked them to find andsolve problems, taught them how to present themselves, trusted themto work on their own, offered them time and freedom to work outsidethe walls of the school, and believed in them.<p>        I visited Bethune Essential School on its first ExhibitionDay, a month before its first class was to graduate. I was there towitness alternative assessment in practice. I was also there topeer into this high school's central mechanism of standard settingand, along with the rest of the school, to test for a match betweenits real graduating seniors and the school's image, crafted fouryears earlier, of what they might be. My visit, and some subsequentruminations on it, gave me three pictures that I carry with me inmy research among other schools that follow Bethune's lead --pictures I characterize as warm, cool, and hard. Each pictureconveys a key dimension of Bethune's achievements as well as someimportant lessons for followers.<p><hr><h2>Warm</h2><hr>Meeting some seniors on the morning of this first Exhibition Day, Ifeel the energy they feel. Though Bethune High School is new to me,I am certain from its air alone that it is different today --crazier but more focused too, like backstage just before curtain.Perhaps the teachers are also more forgiving of interruptions: oneexhibitor's search for a missing poster, another's panickyrecruitment of substitute models for her fashion show, even my lateappearance.<p>        The first of the Senior Exhibitions will begin in twentyminutes, culminating a process that began formally a year ago. Eachsenior has defined and pursued an interdisciplinary question, thatpursuit involving library research and fieldwork. Each has met thedeadlines for a series of submissions:a list of research sources, an outline, notecards, an introduction,a whole draft, a finished paper. This is routine stuff for highschool students -though not usually required of all kids. But now,something beyond routine: each senior has been allotted a half hourin one of the series of Exhibition sessions starting today. Duringthis time, the senior will present highlights from his or herinquiry, then stand for questions. The questioners will includeteachers, other seniors, underclass students (all of whom willattend at least one session of these "orals"), some parents, andsome outside visitors like me.<p>        I shake hands all around, appearing confident that what I amabout to witness will be interesting, novel, worth my train ride.The confidence is genuine, but also a gesture of connection to theproud and friendly company. Privately I am also skeptical, thevictim of some number of shoddy school drama productions, artexhibits, science fairs. These efforts become, I know, necessarilyinvested by a school's belief in itself. That belief is whatcarries everyone through the burdens of mounting such effortsoutside the ordinary bounds of business, though it sometimes swampscritical judgment.<p>        Now for the test. Can each one of the real kids fulfill thecollective image? This is the assessment question. It presents achallenge interwoven with ceremony, rather like an intellectualsenior prom. The challenge is real and difficult, which is whythese seniors are rushing, why they are wearing dresses and ties,why they have taken such care with their graphic displays. Still,they have been well prepared for the challenge -rehearsed andcoached. That is why parents, teachers, principal, sit confidently,why presenters step to the podium and speak confidently. "Goodmorning," they each begin.<p>        It is a scene primed for warm attachments -those investmentsof belief in the performer that arise from a caring history.Without the benefit of warm attachments, most kids do not performat peak ability. They will prefer, instead, to fall short of peakand so avoid the risk that their peak may disappoint themselves andothers. Thus does assessment of any kind become inauthentic.2<p>        Of course, warm attachments can also kill authenticity bysuppressing participants' critical perception. So warm attachmentsmust be balanced by cool judgments. For example, teachers must balance their warm sense of how far each kid has come with a coolsense of what the outside expects of the young educated adult. Thisis tough work in any setting, but particularly in a ceremonial one.<p>        Still, a number of teachers try on this first day of theBethune exhibitions. They ask hard questions. I do, too, though Ifind myself so pleased by the presenters' fortitude in standing forsuch questions that I am perhaps too appreciative of the content ofthe answers. I ask the senior who has just spoken about African-American achievements in several fields, but who has omitted thearts, to correct the omission.<p>        "Who are the African-American writers you admire?" I demand."Maya Angelou, for one," he answers immediately, and goes on to saywhy in detail, though for my part he might well have stopped at thename alone, so impressed am I with his presence of mind. And I amso taken by the clarity and potential of another senior'sexhibition question -Is our water safe to drink? -so warmlyinvested in my own sense of its generative power and its potentialinterdisciplinary sweep, that I fail to recognize that it is onlymy own question that moves the exhibitor's focus past chemistry andpublic health to an observation about water and images of purity.<p>        Meanwhile, amid applause and the palpable pride of teachers,kids, parents, another test is under way: What do theseperformances reveal about the school's own systems? This is thestandardsetting question. And like the assessment question, itdemands both warm and cool approaches.<p>        I wonder, as I sit observing, whether the school will dare toface it. When emotions have subsided, for example, will the facultyreview with a critical eye the videos it has made of theseexhibitions? Video is, as they say, a cool medium. Will youngerstudents watch them, too? Will the portfolios that must accompanythe exhibitions (documenting phases of the inquiry) informteachers' and students' planning of next year's courses andprojects? How far back will the influence of these exhibitions andportfolios run? Will the experience of next year's ninth gradersbe different because of what this year's seniors have done? Willthere be more time set aside from now on for project work andcoaching groups? Will there be more practice speaking beforestrangers? Will the school be materially affected -shifts ofstructures and resources?<p><hr><h2>Cool</h2><hr>It is a year later, and I have just watched a video of last May'sexhibitions at Bethune High School. The video contained a selectionof four exhibitions, none of them from the session I attended. Theschool made the selection for its own purposes -to explain itselfto interested outsiders, to prepare kids to follow last May'spioneers, and to exercise its critical eye, as I suggest above.<p>        I have watched the tape from my perspective as a researcher,interested to see by its light what I take to be some keydimensions of assessment by exhibition. Of course, sitting in myliving room, far in space and time from the warm attachments I feltlast May, I am primed for cool judgment.<p>        The four exhibitions on this tape all deal with contemporarytopics: substance abuse and fetal development; child abuse and thejuvenile court system; recycling and the environment; cholesteroland the American diet. These are my characterizations of thetopics, and I phrase them as I do -simple intersections ofrelatively broad subjects -to emphasize the immensity of the taskthe exhibitors faced and also to say that each of the exhibitionsmight have benefited from more focus. This is the way withcontemporary topics. They are difficult to delineate, which makesthem unlike the topics drawn from textbooks that high schoolstudents more commonly face. And even when one has delineated acontemporary topic reasonably well, that topic may nonethelessslide away even while one speaks.<p>        This happened to the exhibitor who addressed child abuse andthe juvenile court system, but who seemed through most of hisexhibition to focus solely on the court system. Only the firstquestions from his teacher, intent upon directing his attention tochild abuse, cued me that that had indeed been an emphasis of hisrather nervous, muddled introduction. I think I must have losttrack of this emphasis when I sensed the confidence that emerged ashe turned, pointer in hand, to his first exhibits: a flowchartdescription of the juvenile court system and a collection ofdocument specimens from key junctures in that system. He himselfmay have lost track there also.<p>        In fact, I noticed as I watched the other exhibitions, too,that a strong presence sometimes overwhelmed substance. That may bea chronic problem in exhibitions generally: they require courage,and courage -being as rare in school as elsewhere -dazzles. So,one exhibitor's demonstration of how to cook lowfat crab cakes,worthy in its flair of midmorning network television, seemed todistract the exhibitor herself from attending to her main concern,the health impact of cholesterolladen foods. I think it distractedthe audience, too, which got to eat the crab cakes. Another exhibitor's cleverness in presenting his own videotape on Earth Dayevents seemed to relieve him in his own eyes -and perhaps in theaudience's eyes, too -from having to tie this exhibit to his mainpoint. These lapses would have been far less apparent to me, ofcourse, from a warm view, had I been in the audience, too,anticipating crab cakes, impressed by an exhibitor's use of visualmedia.<p>        What can a school do to guard against such lapses? Theanswer, I think, is: Nothing much within the warm setting. Oralexhibitions like those at Bethune High School feature substance andpresence but, I suspect, typically tip the balance of favor to thelatter. For one thing, contemporary American kids, enveloped by popculture, have enormously more access to models of presence thanthey have to models of substance. But, taking advantage of coolopportunities, the school can and must ensure that the assessmentsystem, of which the public exhibition is merely an important part,builds in plenty of substance checks along the way, as well asplenty of models.<p>        Bethune's requirement of a portfolio documenting the inquiry-including notecards, interview transcripts, drafts, a finishedpaper, etc. -are examples of the former. The trick in their usedepends on making them "count" as much as the presentation does,designing them so that they rigorously assess the research process.Any teacher who has ever collected a novice researcher's notecardsknows how easily such a process can become an exercise in assessingform rather than substance, and how impossible it is to know --without taking the time to interview the student -what the cardsreally represent of the process under way. A portfolio of thiskind, to be worth the trouble it takes to keep and review, will bemore than the documentation of a performance; it will be thedocumentation of a coached performance -an artifact of teaching aswell as learning.3<p>        Coaching, however, involves more than ongoing assessment andsupport in following some given process. It also requires theprovision of models -the elaboration by various means of a visionthat the student may aim for. This must be more than a proceduralvision -the model of how to find and follow any compellingquestion. Seventeen-year-olds must also dig for substance in thegardens of mentors who can show them in various ways whatexcellence means (Gardner, 1989). Their teachers cannot know enoughabout all the fields that seniors at Bethune and elsewhere may takean interest in. They therefore cannot be the sole suppliers ofquestion generating experience, the sole models of inquiry, or thesole prescribers and guardians of standards.<p>        Of course, they can and must model inquiry in general, butgood high school inquiry has more than generic quality. It has thewhiff, as well, of incipient expertise. This is what we are used tosensing in some "extra-curricular" pursuits of teenagers -theknowledge of cars or music or perhaps retail merchandising thatalready exceeds what we may know about these things and which wesense is headed toward real depth. We seldom expect to find thesame in school work. One reason, I think, is that we tacitly limitschool work to school grounds. A school like Bethune, on thecontrary, seems willing to give access to many gardens on othergrounds. The success of the effort will depend on whether the kids'digging there is well supported -both on site and back at school.<p>        Meanwhile, there are other kinds of gardens in which futureexhibitors must dig. These gardens are any relevant and richsources of data, insight, and artifact. Access can be in personagain -for example, by means of long and structured visits tomuseums and libraries or a series of interviews; or it can be bymeans of technology -books and microfiche or telecommunicationsand CD-ROM.<p>        But access alone is far from enough. It has become routine totalk about an information explosion and its challenge for schoolcurricula, but to understand the real thing, take any of the fourtopics addressed in the Bethune exhibitions tape -let's say,substance abuse and fetal development -into a well equippedlibrary. See for yourself what the on-line catalog and theelectronic databases and the periodical indexes provide. Unless youare highly focused in your inquiry and comfortable with all the odddiscourse of data in the fields this topic touches, you will surelyfeel overwhelmed -even perhaps yearn for the comfortinginformation vacuum of the average high school library with its out-of-date books and its incomplete collections of Time and ScienceNews. So, the Bethune exhibitors need access to rich informationand also to teachers willing to take their coaching cues frominformation they did not provide and do not control. Moreover, theexhibitors need these things long before they face the pressures ofExhibition Day.<p>        This is an enormous challenge for Bethune or any other highschool, but Bethune is ahead of most others in daring to face it.Watching its own video and prompted by these exhibitions, it canbegin to imagine, as I do, necessary shifts of instructionaldesign. There are signs of what is needed in these exhibitors'occasionally shaky command of information, their apparent gaps ofunderstanding, the unaccountable leaps they sometimes make. "Smok-ing causes low weight babies," one exhibitor declares baldly, and"fetal alcohol syndrome leads to mental retardation." ("Can lead tomental retardation," I want to add from my cool living room.) "Thethree causes of retardation . . ." he begins, and I wish I couldinterrupt coolly: "Only three?"<p>        I offer these phrases as snapshots of a kid trying to holdhis head above very deep water. He hasa lively intelligence that shows even on the cool video, but heneeds more time than even Bethune's unusual structures permit amongadults who swim expertly in this same water. In short, he needseven more time outside the school to do school sanctioned andschool-supported work. But this puts great pressures on his school:if he is so much in the field, how can he complete all his courserequirements? And if the school is not to discharge its supportfunctions through coursework, then how may it discharge thesefunctions?<p>        This student also needs even more access -coached access --to the kinds of data he supplies proudly in his exhibition -city,county, and state data -but which he interprets more clumsily thanone would wish. It is not just that he needs more time andopportunity to visit government offices, but probably also morecoaching on how to read what such foraging turns up. This may alsorequire even more of a shift than Bethune has already made towardcoached project time and what might be called studio work.<p><hr><h2>Hard</h2><hr>A warm regard provides the social investment that both kids andschools need to develop, while a periodic cool regard provides thecritical distance they need to reflect upon this development andshape it. But warm and cool are not enough. What is also wanted issome direction for development: something hard that exists apartfrom warm or cool relationships and orients them -a framework ofstandards.<p>        In matters of assessment, there are three principalstandards: validity, reliability, and equity. Though these termsseem alien to school life, as if they invariably involvedpsychometric engineering, the concerns that inhere in them arenonetheless vital to school development (Stiggins, 1991). As I say,they orient it. The third picture of Bethune's work, framed bythese hard standards, tries to capture this orientation.<p><hr><h3>Validity</h3><hr>        According to the Standards for Educational and PsychologicalTesting of the American Psychological Association (1985), validityrefers to the appropriateness, meaningfulness, and usefulness ofinferences based on assessment. I like to think that validityconstitutes the interface of assessment and the world: it demandsof the test that it measure what is really valued. Evidence ofvalidity in assessment typically comes in three varieties.4 Thefirst, "construct related," has to do with the relationship betweenthe assessment tasks and whatever abstract phenomenon is ofinterest -ability to write, for example, or to conduct an inquiryor to handle questions on one's feet. The second, "content-related," has to do with the relationship between the full sampleof the assessment's demands and the complexity of the domain itpurports to represent. And the third, "criterion related," has todo with the relationship between an assessment's findings and someother measure -for example, between how well kids do on one testand how well they do on another or between how well they do on onetest and how well they do in college.<p>        Psychometricians weigh these kinds of evidence by means ofvarious logical and empirical procedures involving item analyses,the testimony of experts in the domain, and tests of the test. Themethods seem esoteric at first glance from the perspective ofBethune High School, but the glance is deceiving. In fact, thefaculty there should and does analyze its exhibition requirementsto determine their match with its real values. It should and doesinvite the oversight of outsiders (the example of this very paperindicates that). Finally, it should and does corroborate exhibitionresults with other indicators. During the past year, for example,one member of the faculty has toured the campuses where many oflast May's exhibitors study now, interviewing them in order toevaluate how well their school study and exhibitions prepared themfor college.<p>        From the perspective of Bethune High School, however, aconcern for validity in assessment must involve much more than thelocal adaptation of psychometric technique. The heart of it is theassurance of connection between school and the world. Much of whatI say above -both when I write warmly and when I write coolly --has to do with the scope and quality of this connection. Are thekids immersed in the real stuff? In the way they write and speakand handle questions, do they show the right stuff? Validity in theassessment by exhibition at Bethune High School cannot beestablished once and for all; it is a matter of relationship, of awillingness on the part of the school over time to open doors tothe outside, so that mentors and critical friends may visit and sothat kids can go out digging. It is a matter, as I suggest above,of faculty courage. Happily, this is plentiful at Bethune, so thepicture is heartening.<p><hr><h3>Reliability</h3><hr>Packaged tests usually advertise their reliability in correlationcoefficients: measures of how well results from one form of thetest match with another form or how well results from even numbereditems match results from odd numbered items or how well resultsfrom tests match results from retests. From the perspective ofBethune High School, this may seem unimportant -but, again, aquick glance is deceiving. Actually, the longterm success of theassessment system there will depend on reliability in at least tworespects: the achievement of interrater agreement (among themultiple judges of the exhibitions and portfolios); and theachievement of consistency in scoring (across the variousExhibition Days, between one year's exhibitions and the next,between one kid's exhibition and the next one's).<p>        The main difference, however, between achieving assessmentreliability within a school and achieving it in an external test orassessment system is that the former is both a technical and astructural problem. The heart of reliability at the school level isthe assurance of communication among teachers, and this dependsupon structure.  In fact, no standard setting devices, inter-rater agreementmechanisms, or consistency checks can work inside the ordinarycellular structure that is characteristic of nearly every U.S. highschool. Without new structures, teachers will remain isolated, andassessment will remain private and unreliable. Meanwhile,restructuring may not be enough, either. A restructuring plan, forexample, may address other important needs -perhaps providingcollaborative opportunities for planning and teaching -yet stillleave assessment private or else bump it up to some "higher" level(a supposed exchange of power for "accountability"). The latter maywell leave schools and kids worse off than before. As Perrone(1990) notes, accountability, to be worthy of the name, must berooted directly in teaching, not float above it.<p>        In an important sense, reliability from the perspective ofBethune High School is less about seeking agreement -at leastinitially -than it is about seeking and sustaining productivedisagreement. Before they can achieve the degree of reliabilitythat their kids and their bold experiment deserve, the teachers atBethune must dare to disagree with each other, must dare to abandonthe safety of their own private gradebooks. They must inventmethods to assess together, as well as teach and plan and advisestudents together. They have made great strides in this direction:team teaching arrangements and the provision of common planning andmeeting time and the painful effort now under way to extend theEssential School pilot to the whole school. Again, the picture isheartening.<p><hr><h3>Equity</h3><hr>Equity in assessment is often equated with the elimination of bias.This is a matter again for psychometric engineering: one determinesby various means which test items cause particular categories oftesttakers to stumble disproportionately relative to theirperformance on the test as a whole. So boys have trouble with itemsthat refer to colors, and girls have trouble with items that referto sports. This method of bias detection works because the testitems that fall under suspicion are, after all, indirect indicatorsof the achievement that is actually of interest. The item thatrefers to colors or to sports really means to measure readingcomprehension or the ability to solve mathematical word problems;the content of the item -as contrasted with its objective -isirrelevant or, in these cases, misleading.<p>        In performance based assessment, however, one strives fordirect measure, which is to say that content counts. The result isthat bias detection -while nonetheless important -must be merelyone step in achieving equity. What does the Bethune faculty do ifit discovers, in a careful review of exhibition results, that boystend to do better in fielding questions than girls? The answer, Ithink, is not "eliminate the questions," as it might be if theformat did not matter, if the faculty had not deliberately intendedthat all its graduates would be able to handle such questionssuccessfully. Instead, I think the school's response must be tobuild a better scaffold for the girls.<p>        In general, equity in assessment at Bethune High School is amatter of scaffolding. The central problem is how to get everybodyto a place where some never imagined that they could get. This isan equity of results rather than merely of processes; but becausewhat is wanted is an equity of optimal rather than minimal results,new and exceptional processes are required. To continue the examplebegun above, some girls will surely not get there if they aretreated along the way just like boys. Nor will they get there if,for even a moment, they are less pushed than the boys or if, byvarious means, they are segregated from the boys. What is wanted isa community of striving in which the standards of achievement areplainly visible and plainly applicable to all, but in whichsupport, time, and structure all vary according to need and inwhich membership alone moves one forward, quite apart from theeffects of particular instruction.<p>        Of course, such a community is much easier to describe inabstract terms than it is to build. The fact is, at this earlypoint in the effort to remake the American high school, we stilllack good "architectural" models. Nevertheless, we know some of thebuilding materials we will need. For example, we will need"courses" still, but as I suggested above, something else besides --something like "projects," something like what the Bethune kids doin their senior year. And we'll need curriculum, but a kind that isnot wholly contained inside "subjects," one that links rather thanisolates learning experiences, one more embedded than we can nowimagine in real contexts. We will need mechanisms that enableteachers to tune their judgments to common and high standards(Wiggins, 1991); these may take the form of interrater reliabilityschemes within the school and between the school and the outside,which function to aim instruction high as well as keep assessmentreliable.<p>        Then we will need new systems of information management -farmore responsive and capacious than school libraries, transcripts,and textbooks. We'll need grouping patterns more respectful ofhuman diversity and potential than age grading and tracking; andwe'll need management systems that can sustain community betterthan hierarchy can. Finally, and most importantly, we will need acommitment to democratic principles that is more than platitudinous-that can materially affect the school, that can pervade itshabits. At the very least, this will involve a new conception ofintelligence (Wolf et al., 1991) and an uncommon tolerance fordifference and conflict.<p>        If the last paragraph has seemed to sweep far off from issuesof assessment and also from Bethune, the effect is intended. Fromthe perspective of the school, an assessment by exhibition -in allits dimensions -is a systemic thing. It cannot be a matter ofgrafting something new and clever onto an old design -a newportfolio system that is supposed to make everything different,though it has been dumped onto the school's overworked and isolatedEnglish teachers; or a new "authentic" state or national exam whichis supposed to force new modes of instruction but which, as Shepard(1991) points out, also implicitly cheats teachers of theirprofessional status. From the perspective of Bethune High Schoolspecifically, the prospect of an utterly redesigned high school isa distant and daunting one, yet it is exactly what attracted theschool to exhibitions in the first place. And this is the mostheartening picture of all -that this and some other daring schoolswould be willing to scout for the rest of us.<p><hr><h2>References</h2><hr><dl><dd>Fredericksen, J. & A.

The mostrevealinganswer can be had by looking at what we expect from themwhen theirtime is up. What students know and what they can do, after acourse iscompleted or a high school career ended, is in many ways areflectionof what their schools have expected them to master.<p>    For many, this means proving themselves through a seriesof mechanized hoops--machine-scanned textbook tests,achievement and competency tests. But for students in an increasing numberof schools, the question of mastery is becoming at once more messy andmore authentic. What can you really do? teachers uncomfortablewith what conventional tests show are beginning to ask. What do youunderstand about how to get answers to hard questions? And inrealistic contexts before mixed audiences of peers, teachers, and thecommunity, students in many schools are showing us the answers, in theexhibitions that expose the very heart of what the Coalition of EssentialSchools is trying to do.<p>    "In its original form, the exhibition is the publicexpression by a student of real command over what she's learned," says CESChairman Theodore Sizer. "It began in the eighteenth century, as theexit demonstration in New England academies and in colleges like Harvard. The student was expected to perform, recite,dispute, and answer challenges in public session." If such a performanceis well designed, Sizer points out, it elicits proof both of thestudent's understanding and of some imaginative capability-it servesat once as evaluative agent and expressive tool. "We expect people toshow us and explain to us how they use content-it's more than merememory," Sizer says. "It's the first real step towards coming up with someideas of their own."<p>    The concept of performance-based evaluation is nothingnew, notesGrant Wiggins, who has been a consultant to CES onassessment issues;we see it every time someone presents a business proposal,performs in a  recital, plays a ball game. But theexhibition is atleast as much a teaching tool as an assessment method, Sizerpointsout, as much inspiration as measurement. "Giving kids areally goodtarget is the best way to teach them," he says. "And if thegoal is castin an interesting way, you greatly increase the chances oftheirachieving it. When you can see the obvious exhilaration ofthe finalact-as, for example, in really using a foreign languagewell-it'sperceived quite differently from the usual test, which issecret andcomes at you in a way you never see in other areas, withtimeconstraints and machine grading."<p>   If it were not for a bureaucracy of schooling deeplyinvested ineasily generated outcomes, common, sense might dictate thesteps inwhich teachers assess students. Of course we want studentswho arecurious, who know how to approach new problems, who usereading andwriting across the disciplines as a natural part of thatprocess, whoare thoughtful, able, and active citizens. And to get themwe wouldmerely make those goals known from the start, test for themregularly,and correct a student's course when necessary.<p>   What complicates matters is an approach to testing thatoriginated inan era when it still seemed possible, and necessary, toimpart to youngscholars a set body of information. In addition, educationaltheoristsbelieved that the way to learn things was to break them downinto theirsmaller components. Testing reflected those assumptions: itwasdiscipline-specific, content-driven, easily shaped intomultiple-choiceinstruments of assessment. Even reading and writing weretaught andassessed this way, broken down into discrete components thatcould betested and taught separately. In the effort to achieveconsistency and auniform standard, "subjectivity" became a bad word; and inthe push forscientifically accurate assessment no one acknowledged thateven thechoice and wording of items on standardized tests reflectedbiases asreal as those of any classroom teacher.<p>   In our information-loaded age, that system has lostwhateverintellectual credit it may once have had. We can't know all"the facts"anyway; and even if it were possible theorists now thinkstudents learnbest when facts are sought in their context, not inarbitrary sequences.Instead, Essential schools aim for teaching students how tofind out andcritically evaluate the facts they need in a particularsituation- thethoughtful habits of mind that are sometimes called the"higherliteracies." Most standardized tests, critics say, lack thesubtlety andsophistication needed to test such critical thinking skills.<p>   But the old system of testing still has bureaucraticusefulness, andso students still hear its message clearly: they are inschool to besorted, ranked, selected. For better students, this can robtheirstudies of excitement or intellectual purpose. For the lessadvantaged,though, it implies a guaranteed level of failure-becausenorm-referencedstandardized tests distribute students along a bell-shapedcurve whichcan be predicted in advance. Such methods have changedtesting, manyargue, from a teaching and learning tool to the point whereit servesonly a social and political purpose.<p>   To change that pattern, the Coalition of EssentialSchools asserts,we must change the very <i>reason</i> students go to school. Thismust begin,Sizer says, with a new expectation: that all students canuse theirminds well. New incentives are next: real mastery of thingsthey want todo well. Finally, schools must provide new proving groundswhere theycan show off that mastery in positive, public, and personalways. Thislast is known, in Essential schools, as the <i>exhibition</i>; bothin theoryand in practice, it is the cornerstone of what an Essentialschool isall about.<p><hr><h2>What Deserves a Diploma?</h2><hr>In an ideal Essential school, Ted Sizer believes, alldecisions about aschool's curriculum should flow from the devising of aculminatingexhibition at graduation. Do we want graduates to be able tosynthesizeinformation from a variety of disciplines in a well-reasonedargument?Then design courses that give them regular practice in cross-disciplinary inquiry, and require a final project that showsthey can doit. Do we want them to answer and ask questions on theirfeet, to workproductively in groups? Then course work must consciouslytrain them inthese skills. Do we want them to judge the reasonableness ofan answer,whether in mathematics or ethics, and to evaluate thequality ofevidence? Then in every class give priority to such habitsof mind overtraditional coverage of content. Do we want active citizenswho knowtheir rights and ways to affect their own government? Thenrequirecourses that directly engage them in such matters.<p>   Clearly, the structural choices that follow such anevaluation of aschool's ends can be uncomfortably radical. They will affecteveryteacher and every student, at every level from the dailylesson plan tothe final graduation hurdles. It is easy to see why so fewin theCoalition have put the "exit exhibition" first in theirefforts torevise and restructure their schools. If one starts bydefininggraduation requirements in terms of demonstrations ofmastery, it'sdifficult to proceed in cautious little steps.<p>   Instead, most Essential schools have held off ondeveloping aculminating performance before graduation. They prefer todevelop,within individual or team-taught courses, a new style ofassessingstudent progress that relies more on demonstration ofthoughtful habitsof mind and less on memorization of facts. These course-levelexhibitions are referred to within the Coalition as"performances," todistinguish them from the graduation exhibition.<p>   Just what do these performances look like? How are theygraded, andwhat allowance is made for different levels of studentability? Withoutstandard measures, how can a teacher reliably tell if thebasiccompetencies are being mastered? Doesn't it cost a lot to dothings thisway, in teacher time and training, in administering andscoring? Don'twe need to teach students to take the standardized teststhat the realworld judges them by? I asked these questions of Essentialschooltheorists and teachers who have been trying performance-based assessmentin their classrooms.<p><hr><h2>What Performances Look Like</h2><hr>At the classroom level, a performance is often as simple asa finalessay that requires skills in inquiry and synthesis toanswer what theCoalition calls "essential questions." [See HORACE, Volume5, No. 5.] Orit might display student mastery in the form of a project,perhapsundertaken by a group. In some classes students prepareportfolios oftheir best work to submit for evaluation; in others, theypresent theirwork orally and answer questions on it before the class.Whatever itsform, the performance must engage the student in realintellectual work,not just memorization or recall. The "content" studentsmaster in theprocess is the means to an end, not the end itself.<p>   Because Essential school teachers use such skills as partof theireveryday commitment to "active learning," it can be hard totell whereperformances start and regular classwork leaves off. Andindeed,everyone agrees that performances do serve as a teachingtool as much asan assessment tool. But if we are to consider performancesas analternative to conventional testing, it is most  useful tolook at theirevaluative purpose.<p>   For example, at Springdale High School in Arkansas,humanitiesteacher Melinda Nickle and the other members of her teachingteamdevised a final exam that could be used for classes ininquiry andexpression, literature and fine arts, social studies, andscience. (SeeFigure 2.) Students are asked to link research materialsacross thedisciplines in a thematic essay; later they participate ingroupevaluationsof each others' papers. The format is aimed atmany essentialskills at once: an interdisciplinary approach,"student-as-worker," thedevelopment of critical thinking, and so on. It took a lotof time,Nickle says: at least two teachers had to evaluate eachpaper and thencompare scores before a grade was put on them. But "all ourstudentsremarked on how much they learned from the performance," shesays. "Theyspent hours working on it at a time of year when moststudents hadalready shut down due to the approaching vacation."<p>   At Adelphi Academy in Brooklyn, New York, science teacherChetPielock and humanities teacher Loretta Brady ask students toform teamsto investigate Latin America's problems of poverty andilliteracy,overcrowding, earth-quakes, and political instability. (SeeFigure 3.)To answer some questions in the performance students mustexhibitdetailed geographic knowledge; to answer others, they mustrelate themto society and history. Interesting issues can arise fromsuch work: Howare "natural resources" regarded by different cultures? Whathappenswhen different cultures conflict over the value of a naturalresource?How do natural resources function in human struggles forpower?<p>   The best performances and exhibitions are not merelyprojects aimedat motivating students; they evoke fundamental questionswithin adiscipline. For a final exam in both history and English,for example,one teaching team has students support or refute thestatement, "Whatmatters in history is not societies or events, butindividuals." (SeeFigure 4.) Because it asks the essential question "Whatcauseshistory?", such an inquiry can reflect not only how we seethe past but how we think about the present and future. Nextstudentsare asked to evaluate their own essay along specificcriteria, and thento relate an "English" essay on subjectivity in researchwriting to itas well-revealing the interdisciplinary connections betweenliteratureand history.<p><hr><h2>How to Grade a Performance</h2><hr>One of the reasons conventional tests hold such sway inschools, ofcourse, is that they are easy to grade. Are teachers'evaluations ofexhibitions and performances as objective and reliable asthe multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blanks tests theyreplace? "We can'tevade thesevery technical questions of reliability and validity," GrantWigginssaid in a summer workshop on exhibitions for EssentialSchool teachers."To ask about validity is to ask if the task represents thereal thingwe want to assess. Does it really present the student'sabilities,traits, capacity for long-term work? For example, the SAT isvalidbecause it statistically correlates with later success incollege. Butdoes it really represent the things the student can be goodat, or justone thing?"<p>   Reliability is another question, says Wiggins. "Would thestudent getthe same score if he took the test again and gave the sameperformance?"he asks. "Or would different people score it differently?Standardizedtests are reliable by design, but we question theirvalidity.Exhibitions, on the other hand, are valid-but notnecessarily reliable.How do we protect students from capricious, biasedjudgments?"<p>   A related question is whether there must be one standardfor thesuccess of a student performance. Should standards varyaccording to theperformer's level of intelligence, age, sex, race, familycircumstances,future plans? "The failure to think through this questionhas led t ushaving no standards at all," Wiggins argues. "You can walkinto any highschool in America and see two teachers grade the same levelwork indramatically different ways."<p>   But teachers who use exhibitions in the classroom speakin matter-of-fact terms about how they evaluate student performance."You've got todecide what's being graded ahead of time, and be clear aboutit with thestudent," says Melinda Nickle. "We assess the way they work,the waythey use their time, the way they speak and write, theideas they bring to the performance-things that cannot beevaluated by atypical pen and paper test." Moreover, Nickle says, studentsare usuallyworking in groups as they prepare their performances,freeing her tocirculate, ask questions, and ascertain weaknesses andstrengths.<p>   "I don't question the accuracy of our assessment," Nicklesays. "Itactually is a lot more valuable than the traditional test,where whatyou mostly find out is if the student can memorize well orif he studiedthe night before. In fact, many students new to our programareunsettled by how high our expectations are- it is hard toget by withoutgetting actively engaged in the learning."<p>   Nickle is one of many teachers who require students toparticipate intheir own assessments. "When a student presents anexhibition in myclass," she says, "they might start out mumbling or speakingtoo fast. Isay, 'go slow, breathe deeply,' and remind them that theyare practicingspeaking skills. Pretty soon the other students areprompting them,too." Math teacher Glynn Meggison at Fox Lane High School inBedford, New York has begun to invite his classes to grapplewith self-evaluations. "One kid broke it down into actual percentages:quality ofgroup work, individual work, presentation," he says. Suchactivities arethemselves a form of learning, teachers say; as studentsinternalize thecriteria, they become better performers and better criticsof others'performances.<p>   The question of skill levels points up both a practicalproblem ofcomparative grading and a fundamental issue in education:the trackingof students early on into ability groups that will classifythem foryears to come. No one quarrels with the reality thatstudents presentthemselves at different levels; but Wiggins argues thatconventionalmeans of grading -the bell-shaped curve, norm-referencedstandardizedtests, and tracking-merely discourage students from reachingtowardhigher goals. Again, he contrasts the academic model withthe world ofsports or the arts, where expert players are always beforestudents asmodels of the excellence they are striving for.<p>   At Central Park East Secondary School in New York,students in aclass of mixed ability levels set goals with the teacherahead of timeto aim for either a "competent" or "advanced" level ofclassroomperformances, and they are evaluated accordingly. Instead ofpresentingwatered-down challenges for lower skill levels-"dumbingdown" the tests,as Grant Wiggins calls it- the same tasks are presented toall students,just as they are in real-life situations, and extra helpgiven wherenecessary. The student can thus learn from tests-and learn,as he willin real life, from the more sophisticated responses of thoseat moreadvanced levels.<p>   With clear objectives for pupil achievement, teachers canbe moreconfident that grades really give direct information aboutwhere thestudent stands at that moment and where she is going next.This approachhas been probably most carefully worked out in GreatBritain, where acomprehensive national curriculum and testing system hasbeen underdevelopment for some time. The system provides step-by-stepinstructionsfor teachers to assess students at varying levels ofability. Theseguidelines actually ask teachers to prompt students if theycannotanswer a question on their own--and if necessary, to TEACHtheappropriate skill then and there. (See Figure 5.) Answersare calibratedon a scale that divides them into two large categories,"unaidedsuccess" and "aided success," within which students arerated furtheraccording to the level of their performance.<p>   It seems clear that the careful devising of a scoringrubric is acrucial step in beginning to evaluate student performances.Onecharacteristic of a good scorecard is that it honors avariety ofaspects of the student's performance. Is the student's work<i>process</i>being evaluated, for example, or merely the <i>product</i>? Areenterprise,flair, and creativity given equal weight with perseveranceandcarefulness, and are those weighted equally withachievement? Does thefluent speaker have as good a chance to excel as the fluentwriter, thecreative artist as good a chance as the computer whiz? Thebestperformances are authentic reflections of a student'sdevelopment ofthoughtful habits of mind; they honor and use that student'suniquequalities rather than force them into a predetermined mold.(RichardStiggins of the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratoryhas developeda short manual on how to design and develop performanceassessments; itcan be had for $1 by writing NCME, Teaching Aids ITEMSModule #1, 123017th St., NW, Washington, DC 20036.)<p><hr><h2>Can You Fail an Exhibition?</h2><hr>In many ways, performances and exhibitions are set up sothat a studentcannot fail. If a classroom performance is inadequate, itserves not asa final judgment but as a revealing indicator of where thestudent needsextra attention in developing skills before the nextperformance.Evaluations are conducted on a continuum. As for culminatingorgraduation exhibitions, one simply does not attempt themuntil one isready to do well.<p>   In an authentic performance, Grant Wiggins says, thestudent knowsthe nature of the challenge ahead of time, as with anathletic orartistic event. "The recital, debate, play, or game is theheart of thematter," he asserts. "All coaches happily teach to it."Because they canbe practiced for, performances take on a teaching functionat least asimportant as their evaluative function. And because theyrepresentdeveloping skills, a student's progress is emphasized ratherthan ascorecard of his errors.<p>   "People do fail," Ted Sizer says. "People do persist inthinking thattwo and two makes five, or in writing graceless prose. Atthe same time,the same person who can't write may be able to draw-may beable toexplain something of importance in a different way. Thetrick in goodschooling is not just to meet minimum standards but to findout where aperson is strong and make sure the person succeeds there.You need tosee the best of a student on a regular basis; otherwise heloses selfconfidence."<p>   Mike Goldman, who taught humanities at Central Park Eastand nowworks at CES, puts it even more strongly. "How can you testwhether astudent feels good about learning?" he asks. "That is thejob ofschools-and if a student doesn't have it, the school hasfailed, not thestudent." Grant Wiggins also questions what he calls the"gate keeping"function of assessment, which requires the student'sperformance to bereduced to one score and ranked. "Why must the transcriptreduceperformance to a letter grade that tells neither what astudent can donor what the strengths and weaknesses are that went into thegrade?" hesays. Moreover, some important things, like cooperation, maybe bestassessed indirectly, through other kinds of performances."These thingsare complicated to assess- they involve values, attitudes,and thelike," Wiggins says. "Do we want to be in the business ofgiving someonea grade on how much he loves learning? Are we going to fallinto thetrap of the standardized test, that you can isolate everylittle thingand test for it?"<p><hr><h2>Recording Achievement</h2><hr>Developing a precise scoring rubric, of course, is not theonly way ofkeeping records of student achievement. Alternatives includethe keepingof anecdotal records, or assembling portfolios of astudent's best work.At School Without Walls, a public alternative high school inRochester,New York where performance is a fundamental aspect ofinstruction,teachers and community-based supervisors keep writtenrecords of studentprojects that become a permanent part of their records. Suchanecdotalrecords can provide a richness of detailed information thatcannot beachieved with any rating scale. In fact, at Central ParkEast principalDeborah Meier is experimenting with purely narrative recordsas analternative to report cards that formerly combined commentswith gradeclassifications like "Satisfactory" (plus or minus),"Distinguished,"and "Unsatisfactory." "Otherwise parents and students zoomin on thegrades, and ignore the rest of the report," she says.<p>   In evaluations of student writing proficiency, portfolioshave beenused increasingly by a number of states over the lastdecade. Butstudent portfolios can include much more than writingsamples; at SchoolWithout Walls a student's final transcript is a collectionof teacherevaluations, critiques by community supervisors, statecompetency tests,and student writings. And at Thayer High School inWinchester, NewHampshire, principal Dennis Littky has students keep anongoingvideotape of their own progress in various areas from thetime theyenter school to their graduation.<p>   How can teachers keep assessments from being capriciousand biased?Grant Wiggins suggests that schools develop an oversightprocess such asa teacher committee on testing standards; in the process, henotes,useful dialogue and teacher training could be taking place.Where morestandardized but teacher-given tests are being developed, asin GreatBritain, a "group moderation" process allows collectivescrutiny andreview of any discrepancies that show up between differentschools, orbetween one school's results and those on a national level.<p><hr><h2>The Measure of Competency</h2><hr>Still, the issue of measuring competency is real, and anyschoolincorporating performances into its philosophy will need toface it. Theanswer seems twofold. First, at most Essential schoolsstudents wholearn through regular performances actually do better oncompetencytests than they did in the old days. Figures from schoolslike WalbrookHigh School in Baltimore bear this out (see HORACE, Volume6, No. 1),and so does research into the effects of raised expectationson studentmotivation and performance. In a good exhibition, depth ofcoverage ismore important than breadth; and to attain that depth,students must notonly know their evidence, but know how to use it critically.<p>   Second, some schools have been able to substitute theirowndemonstrations of mastery for state competency tests invariousdisciplines. States like Connecticut, Vermont, andCalifornia, anddistricts like Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, and Shoreham-WadingRiver, NewYork, are taking steps to incorporate performance-basedassessment intonot only writing evaluations but those for math, science,socialstudies, and other subjects. The trend is slowly making itsway upward:at the federally supported National Assessment ofEducational Progress,researchers are beginning to incorporate portfolios andotherperformance-based information into a broader base ofinformation theyhave collected on student skills over the last two decades.<p>   At the policy level, experts say, it will take a lot morethan thisto change an entrenched system that values easily measuredskills overinquiry and thoughtfulness. Until policy makers issue cleardirectivesfor more performance-based assessment, schools will have topush forrecognition of new ways on a case-by-case basis. But somesigns indicatethat organized teacher pressure is mounting for change atthe policylevel. English teachers were directly responsible forstates' acceptanceof portfolio-based writing assessment over the last decade.And recentlythe National Council of Teachers of Mathematics hasintroduced sweepingnew demands in its criteria for curricula, focusing onmathematicalchallenges that push students to apply known facts in newways.<p><hr><h2>Exit Exhibitions</h2><hr>Ultimately, Ted Sizer believes, the question of performance-basedassessment must be addressed at an even broader and deeperlevel. If aschool believes its chief task is to help students masterthoughtfulhabits of mind, then the demonstration of that mastery-nottheaccumulation of credits, or the passing of time-must be thesolecriterion by which students qualify for graduation. Manyschools aremoving toward this kind of goal when they require, forexample, a seniorthesis that integrates research in several disciplines. Buta handful ofEssential schools- among them Walden III in Racine,Wisconsin, CentralPark East Secondary School, and School Without Walls-havegone muchfurther, shaping their entire curricula so that thegraduationexhibition, or "exit exhibition," is the focus of students'last yearsin school.<p>   What exactly is an exit exhibition? Ideally, it is ademonstrationby the student in front of a review committee, at which heor she showsoff the essential skills learned in the high school years.If theschool's standards are met in the opinion of the committee,the studentwill receive the diploma. First, though, the student muststand up tothe kind of probing questioning that we usually associatewith thedefense of a doctoral dissertation. It is not enough to showsimplerecall of memorized facts; the review board is looking foran ability touse knowledge, put things together, or go looking for factswhen ananswer is unknown.<p>   In the end, students at schools like these are asked toshow theyknow much more than those in conventional schools. Not onlymust theymeet competency requirements in traditional areas andproduce work thatintegrates material across the disciplines, but they mustdemonstratetheir mastery of skills that will carry them into adultlife. CentralPark East, for one, expects proficiency in everything frompersonaleconomics to voter registration procedures and operating acomputer.<p>   The "Rite of Passage Experience," or ROPE, program atWalden III,which has been in place for over a decade, is a fullydeveloped model ofhow such a requirement can function. Born from theAustralian"walkabout" tradition in which a youngster must meet certainchallengesto attain adulthood, ROPE is expressly designed "to evaluatestudents'readiness for life beyond high school." In order tograduate, eachsenior must satisfactorily present a written portfolio, awrittenproject, and an oral demonstration before a committee madeup of staff,another student, and an adult from the community. Thefifteen requiredareas of mastery cover a wide range; students not onlydemonstratecompetency in academic disciplines but submit othermaterials like awritten autobiography, a reflection on work, an essay onethics, and areport analyzing mass media. (See Figure 6.) The ROPErequirements arevery close to the graduation exhibitions in use atRochester's SchoolWithout Walls, and to those being developed at Central ParkEastSecondary School.<p>   Students follow a strict schedule in preparing theirprojects andportfolios, which must be ready for presentation by the endof firstsemester. At Walden III, ROPE committees schedule as many asfivemeetings with each senior during the second semester- enoughso that ifweaknesses are evident, the student has the chance to remedythem. Thewhole process is expensive in terms of teacher time, notesThomasFeeney, who teaches a first-semester class preparing seniorsto presentthemselves to their ROPE committees. A minimum of ten hoursof teachertime is spent examining each student-time which must comeeitherdirectly from courses or from conference periods. "To carryit off youneed either a very committed school board or a very flexiblecurriculum,or both," Feeney says.<p>   At Central Park East, the first eleventh-grade class islaunched thisyear on a two-year "Senior Institute" designed to culminatein an exitexhibition similar to Walden III's. The program includes notonlytraditional course work but internships and lab work,seminars andindependent study in collaboration with local universities,and summerprojects. Because it is oriented toward mastery rather thanaccumulationof credits, the Institute is time-flexible; it may take moreor lessthan two years depending on the student's needs and desires.And it ispersonal; each student is coached and advised throughout bya teacherresponsible for no more than fifteen students and twoacademic courses.<p>   Evaluation of exit exhibitions follows the same kind ofproceduresused in classroom performances- except that a student rarelygets to theexhibition stage unless he or she is actually ready todemonstratemastery. If there are problems, the committee usuallycatches them in anearly review. Still, if a majority of the group eventuallyso votes, thestudent will go back for as much more preparation as he orshe needsuntil true mastery is achieved.<p>   "In a way, as a method of evaluating what students knowat the end ofhigh school perhaps it's <i>too</i> good," says Thomas Feeney. "Wesubstituteour own competency demonstrations for the standardized testsin theareas required by the district. But whereas students cansometimessqueak through on regular competency tests, with ROPE we getsmackedright in the face with what they don't know." Feeneydirectly attributeschanges in Walden' s curriculum requirements to this fact."We nowrequire two quarters of geography, for instance, tograduate," he says.And ROPE results spark intense discussion among faculty, hesays, as tohow and when certain subjects should be presented.<p>   That is probably the chief reason that exit exhibitionsare such adifficult and controversial way for schools to show theircommitment toactive learning. If they start by defining clear standardsfor studentmastery, change in every area of the curriculum isunavoidable. Afterall, one cannot expect some students to be held to a newgraduationstandard and others to the old way, some teachers to demandonly skillsin rote and recall and others to ask students to think theirway throughharder challenges. If no consensus exists on what studentsshould knowand be able to do when school is over, a school may be splitat its very core. Exit exhibitions, then, can be diagnostictool orcatalyst; they cannot be a neutral, "safe" assessmentmeasure.<p>   Does this mean that exit exhibitions are only possible insmaller,alternative high schools with structures that invite suchindividualassessments? "You can't really do them unless you know thekids," TedSizer responds. But big schools should address that, hesays, byreducing their crushing teaching loads, personalizing andrestructuringthe curriculum so there is time for this kind of attention.And onceexhibitions become a way of teaching, he says, teachers andstudentsboth are energized by the results." To say 'Our kind of kidsor teacherswouldn't do it' is just a self-fulfilling prophecy," heasserts.<p>   For students, making exit exhibitions the end of theirschoolcareers also creates deep and encompassing changes. CPE'sSeniorInstitute, for example, starts with making a post-graduationplan,which gives direction to all the student's efforts towardthe diploma.This becomes a key part of the portfolio reviewed by thegraduationcommittee, but it serves a more important role as well: itanswers thequestion, "Why am I in high school?" Throughout the finalyears of highschool, students must come to terms with the ways everythingthey doreflects back on that question and shapes its answer.<p>   The "atmosphere of unanxiously high expectation andtrust" which is acommon principle of Essential schools is a key element inputting theexit exhibition into place. Students get a clear messagethat highschool is over only when they can demonstrate competence inareasthat mean something to them and to the community. Whetherthatrevolutionizing principle can be as effective in schoolsthat starttheir performances at the classroom level instead of bydefininggraduation requirements is an open question. Ted Sizerbelieves not; theCoalition is exploring the possibility of starting severalnew schoolsin which the entire curriculum would flow from theculminatingexhibition. In the meantime, teachers and students inEssential schoolscontinue to grapple at every level with how to assess truethoughtfulness, real mastery, and a broad range of studentcapacities.<p><hr>             <h2> Figure 1: Qualities of "AuthenticPerformances"</h2><hr><h3>Structure and Logistics</h3><ul><li>Are more appropriately public; involve an audience orpanel.<li>Do not rely on unrealistic and arbitrary time constraints.<li>Offer known, not secret, questions or tasks.<li>Are more like portfolios or a season of games, not one-shot.<li>Require some collaboration with others.<li>Recur-and are worth practicing for and retaking.<li>Make assessment and feedback to students so central thatschoolschedules, structures, and policies are modified to supportthem.</ul><p><h3>Intellectual Design Features</h3><ul><li>Are "essential"-not needlessly intrusive, arbitrary, ordesigned to"shake out" a grade.<li>Are "enabling"-constructed to point the student towardsmoresophisticated use of the skills or knowledge.<li>Are contextualized, complex intellectual challenges, not"atomized"tasks corresponding to isolated "outcomes."<li>Involve the student's own research or use of knowledge,for which"content" is a means.<li>Assess student habits and repertoires, not mere recall orplug-inskills.<li>Are representative challenges-designed to emphasize depthmore thanbreadth.<li>Are engaging and educational.<li>Involve somewhat ambiguous tasks or problems.</ul><p><h3>Grading and Scoring Standards</h3><ul><li> Involve criteria that assess essentials, not easilycounted butrelatively unimportant errors.<li>Are graded not on a curve but in reference to performancestandards(criterion-referenced, not norm-referenced).<li>Involve demystified criteria of success that appear tostudents asinherent in successful activity.<li>Make self-assessment a part of the assessment.<li>Use a multifaceted scoring system instead of one aggregategrade.<li>Exhibit harmony with shared schoolwide aims-a standard.</ul><p><h3>Fairness and Equity</h3><ul><li>Ferret out and identify (perhaps hidden) strengths.<li>Strike a constantly examined balance between honoringachievement andnative skill or fortunate prior training.<li>Minimize needless, unfair, and demoralizing comparisons.<li>Allow appropriate room for student learning styles,aptitudes, andinterests.<li>Are attempted by all students, with the test "scaffoldedup," not"dumbed down," as necessary.<li>Reverse typical test-design procedures.

What do they show?<p><ol> <li> Schematic diagrams showing the cross sections ofenergy forcesbelow the surface of the land (volcanoes, trenches, etc.)<li>Maps showing the land movement of the plates of theearththroughout earth history, focusing especially on themovement concerningLatin America.<p></ol><p>Among the things you will need to find out:<p><ol><li>Why are there mountains and volcanoes where they arein LatinAmerica? (Why is this country full of highlands while Africawas mostlya land of plateaus?)<li>What are the natural hazards of the land? Why is thereapersistent threat of earthquakes? What has to be done or hasbeen doneto accommodate this natural hazard?<li>How did the bridge between the Americas form? How hasthe movementof the earth's plates effected migration in Latin America(plant andanimal)?   <li> How does the earth produce the energy needed for allthis colossalmovement?</ol><p><h3>Group 2. What are the resources of the land?</h3>Your group must find answers to and understand thefollowing:<p><ol> <li>What are the animal, vegetable, mineral resources ofthe land?(Any oil?) How rich is the land for farming? Is there enoughwater? Whatfood do they rely on and in what parts of Latin America dothey usecertain kinds of food?<li>Why do they have the kind of vegetation they have? Or,why are (orare not) the climate zones dry like Africa, which fallsroughly on thesame equatorial line and latitudinal lines as Latin America?  <li>How do the seasons differ from those of North America?<li>How do Latin American birds and plants differ fromthose ofAfrica? Why do they have the adaptations, the differencesthey do? Whatspecial purpose do the unique plants of Latin America serve?</ol><p>Your group must construct, and be able to discuss themeaning of, mapsor diagrams showing the following:<p><ol>  <li> The vegetation/climate zones in Latin America.  <li>The atmospheric currents and important ocean currentswhichinfluence climatic zones in Latin America. You may need toincludeaverage rainfall statistics.<li> The hydrologic cycle.<li>The important resources and where they are found.</ol><p><h3>Group 3. Where do the people live on the land?</h3>Your group is responsible for finding out:<p><ol>   <li>Where did the first societies (and first migrantpeople) live inLatin America? Why there? How could people have migrated toLatinAmerica? Could people have come from Africa?  <li>Where was the population living around 1800-1850? Whatgroups wereliving where? Why there? (Consider especially thegroups/races of peoplethroughout the West Indies and all of Latin America.)   <li> Where do people live today? Why? What are thedifferentgroups/races living in Latin America today? Where dodifferent languagegroups/races live today? What effect does that have on thecountries inLatin America?</ol><p>Your group must be able to construct and fully explain thefollowing:<p><ol><li>A map of the populations for each of the three questionsabove.Question 3 may require more than one map if you think it isnecessary,or a clear overlay.<p></ol>     (Thanks to Chet Pielock and Loretta Brady at AdelphiAcademy,Brooklyn, New York.)<p><hr><h2>            Figure 4: A Final Performance in History andEnglish</h2><hr>Your final exhibition to demonstrate mastery of the materialof thesetwo courses for the first semester will be divided into twoparts. Thefirst part is a research paper. The second part is the finalexamination. Together these constitute 25% of your grade forEnglish and20% of your grade for World History.<p>1. For the research assignment, write a five to seven pagepaperaddressing the following: "What matters in history is notsocieties orevents, but individuals." Discuss the validity of thisconcept ofhistory by citing at least three specific examples from yourstudiesthis semester that support or refute the concept.<p>   Your paper will be graded by both your history and yourEnglishteacher and a grade assigned by each, based on the standardsin the"Written Exhibition Assessment Form," attached.<p>2. The final examination will be taken during the periodscheduled forthe English examination. It will consist of three parts:<p>   a. An essay evaluating your research paper, both incontent andmechanics. You will read the attached excerpt onsubjectivity,objectivity, relativity, and balance in academic writing(pages 6-7 fromToby Fulwiler, College Writing. Boston: Scott, Foresman,1988). As youread it, think how the points he makes apply to his researchpaper. Thenwrite an essay reflecting on how these ideas are illustratedby yourpaper. Specifically, you need first to prepare a topicoutline,including a thesis statement, for the essay. Then summarizein your ownwords each of Fulwiler's main points, and cite at least onespecificexample from your research paper of each of these points.Where youidentify subjectivity or use of judgment in your paper,discuss whetherthere was adequate evidence in your paper to support thesesubjectivestatements. Finally, discuss why you think you made theseparticularsubjective statements. In other words, how did one of yourpersonalvalues enter into the research and writing of the paper?<p>   b. An essay relating your English course readings to thethesis ofyour research paper. This will also involve an analysis of ashort,related work during the final.<p>3. During the period scheduled for your history finalexamination, youwill meet with both your history and English teacher todiscuss yourcourse work for the semester, your research paper, and yourfinalexamination.<p>     [Thanks for this performance to John Bohannon, ahistory teacher atVermont Academy who attended a CES exhibitions workshop.(VermontAcademy is not a member of CES)]<p><hr>        <h2>Figure 5: The Apu Assessment of Mathematics (GreatBritain)</h2><hr>The following section comes from the assessor's manual in anoralmathematics test of 15-year-olds, involving the ideas ofperimeter,area, and circumference:<p>1.

Nine of thepresentations arebased on the materials in the portfolio and the project; theremainingsix presentations are developed especially for thepresentation process.<p><h3>The Portfolio</h3> The portfolio, developed during the first semester of thesenior year,is intended to be "a reflection and analysis of thegraduating senior'sown life and times." Its requirements are:<p><ol><li>A written autobiography, descriptive, introspective, andanalytical.School records and other indicators of participation may beincluded.<li>A reflection on work, including an analysis of thesignificance ofthe work experiences for the graduating senior's life. Aresume can beincluded.<li>Two letters of recommendation (at minimum) from anysources chosen bythe student.<li> A reading record including a bibliography, annotated ifdesired, andtwo mini-book reports. Reading test scores may be included.<li> An essay on ethics exhibiting contemplation of thesubject anddescribing the student's own ethical code.<li>An artistic product or written report on art and an essayon artisticstandards for judging quality in a chosen area of art.<li>A written report analyzing mass media: who or whatcontrols massmedia, toward what ends, and with what effects. Evidence ofexperiencewith mass media may be included.<li> A written summary and evaluation of the student's coursework inscience/technology; a written description of a scientificexperimentillustrating the application of the scientific method; an(withexamples) on social consequences of science and technology;and  inmodern society.</ol><p><h3>The Project</h3> Every graduating senior must write a library research-basedpaper thatanalyzes an event, set of events, or theme in Americanhistory.

Forthese,however, no written reports or new products are required bythecommittee. Supporting documents or other forms of evidencemay be used.Assessment of proficiency is based on the demonstration ofknowledge andskills during the presentations in each of the followingareas:<p><ol><li>Mathematics knowledge and skills is demonstrated by acombination ofcourse evaluations, test results, and work sheets presentedbefore thecommittee, and by the ability competently to fieldmathematics questionsasked during the demonstration.<li>Knowledge of American government should be demonstratedby discussionof the purpose of government; the individual's relation tothe state;the ideals, functions, and problems of American politicalinstitutions;and selected contemporary issues and political events.Supportingmaterials can be used.<li> The personal proficiency demonstration requires thestudent to thinkabout an organize a presentation about the requirements ofadult livingin our society in terms of personal fulfiUment, socialskills, andpractical competencies; and to discuss his or her ownstrengths andweaknesses in everyday living skiUs (health, home economics,mechanics,etc.) and interpersonal relations.<li>Knowledge of geography should be demonstrated in apresentation thatcovers the basic principles and questions of the discipline;identification of basic landforms, places, and names; andthe scientificand social significance of geographical information.<li>Evidence of the graduating senior's successful completionof aphysical challenge must be presented to the ROPE committee.<li> A demonstration of competency in English (written andspoken) isprovided in virtually all the portfolio and projectrequirements. These,and any additional evidence the graduating senior may wishto present tothe committee, fulfill the requirements of the presentationin theEnglish competency area.</ol><p>     (The above is drawn from the 1984 student handbook,"Walden III'sRite of Passage Experience," by Thomas Feeney, a teacher atWalden III,an alternative public school in Racine, Wisconsin.Preliminaryannotations are by Grant Wiggins.)<p><hr>                             <h2> Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or comingeditions.

<html><head><title>CES: Publications: Research Papers: The Digital Portfolio</title></head><body><h1><center>The Digital Portfolio: A Richer Picture of Student Performance</center></h1><hr><h3><center>by David Niguidula, Coalition of Essential Schools</center></h3><center>October 1993</center><hr><p><i>The Coalition of Essential Schools gratefully acknowledges the IBM Corporation for its support of research on Exhibitions.</i><p><hr>What do we really know about a high school graduate's academic career? If we can't talk to the student personally -- and even if we can -- we rely on records. For the most part, a student record con-sists of two things: grades on a transcript and stan-dardized test scores. If a potential employer wants to know if the graduate has the ability to write a business report, she has to make do with a "B-" in English 2 or a 530 on the verbal portion of the SAT -- or, even more generally, something like a 2.85 grade-point average or a 57th percentile marking.<p>        Grant Wiggins suggests this experiment.1 Go into any sports bar and ask, "Who's the best active major league baseball player?" In the ensuing argument, you'll hear about the quality of a catcher's defensive play or the leadership he brings to the team. You'll hear a bunch of numbers, too, from home runs to batting averages to errors, and arguments over which numbers are more significant. The truth is that any sports fan knows that no one statistic can capture a player's entire career -- even the tables of fine print on the back of every baseball card cannot entirely replicate images of play lodged in a fan's memory (or video collection). Yet, we have a tendency to reduce academic careers to just a few numbers.<p>        We can gain a better understanding of a student's abilities and accomplishments by simply looking at the student's work, rather than the abstracted final grade. This, of course, is the primary idea behind portfolio assessment: students can compile their best work in writing, math, science, art, and even community service and present a more vivid record of what they are able to do. Portfolios are gaining currency as an assessment alternative to report cards and transcripts; numbers of schools, and even entire states -- notably Kentucky and Vermont -- are using portfolios to get a more accurate description of a student's capabilities.<p>        To a school interested in reform, the idea sounds terrific; that portfolios can provide a more detailed picture than test scores and letter grade transcripts is beyond question. Then reality strikes. What are we going to do with ALL THIS STUFF? In Kentucky -- where, as part of the Education Reform Act, portfolios are now in place in writing and math and will soon be in place for other disciplines -- there are stories of schools budgeting for a hundred filing cabinets. <p>        Even beyond the logistical nightmare of thousands of papers turning brittle and collecting dust, there are at least two other practical drawbacks. First, not everything may be on paper. A student's best demonstration of mathematical reasoning ability may be a three-dimensional model; a student's best articulation of historical under-standing may have come during a debate. Yes, we can use photographs and videotapes -- but  these give rise to even more issues of storage. Second, the mass of paper and other materials isn't easily managed for presentation in a filing cabinet. What if a research paper in history is the best example of writing a student completed? Do we make two copies of the paper and file one under "history" and one under "writing"? Do we keep a paper index or develop an elaborate system for cross-referencing? <p>        Further, how does this student's piece compare with those of students from other years? How can a younger student see a "benchmark" performance that meets the high standard that she is striving to achieve? Portfolios are typically filed by student -- last name first, etc. -- but what if we want to compare two or more students' writing samples? A paper chase ensues.<p>        The Exhibitions Project at the Coalition of Essential Schools, with support from the IBM Corporation, has been developing a way to address these problems. Using computer technology, we can create a richer picture of what a student can know and do. Our task is to create a tool to communicate that picture. This paper describes our prototype for a "digital" portfolio.2<p><hr><h2>A Tool for Planning Backwards</h2><hr>The Digital Portfolio is a computer-based tool for what the Exhibitions Project of the Coalition has termed "planning backwards."3 A school can approach decisions about its system of education by addressing a series of three questions:<p><ol>        <li><i>    What should a graduate of this school know and be able to do? </i>  The answer to this question is the "vision" of the qualities that a graduate -- any graduate -- should possess. The vision needs to be created by the school community, led by the faculty that will be looking for those qualities in their classrooms.<p>       <li><i>     How can a student demonstrate the skills and knowledge that a graduate should have?</i>   In other words, how would we know that a student has the qualities to fulfill our vision? Here, the answer might take the form of a set of "exhibitions" or other performance-based assessments completed either individually or collaboratively.<p>       <li><i>     How can the school arrange its systems so that all students can exhibit the desired skills and knowledge? </i>  This is where the real work of school change begins. The school needs to look at all its systems -- curriculum, pedagogy, assessment, schedul-ing, administration, and so on -- in an honest attempt to determine if the decisions it makes are helping students fulfill the vision. Often this takes a great deal of "rewiring" of communication within the school -- not just with physical wires, but by creating a structure of time and space that allows everyone involved with the school to communicate.</ol></ol><p>        The Digital Portfolio represents a tool that may help a school develop some preliminary answers to these questions.<p><hr><h2>A Walk Through the Digital Portfolio Prototype</h2><hr>The Digital Portfolio is a "hypermedia" document. This simply means that the portfolio is a set of screens (or pages, in the terminology of the software) that are linked by buttons on the screen. When the user clicks the mouse to select a button, the program reacts, typically by navigating to another screen or by showing some additional information. In this section, we will walk through the prototype. Keep in mind that this is a work in progress -- a demonstration to begin the conversation, rather than a completed product.<p>        The opening page of the Digital Portfolio is an identification of the student and her school.  In the bar along the bottom of the screen are several buttons; clicking on any of the words in that bar elicits an action. For example, clicking on the Photo button allows the user to see a digitized photo of the student. Clicking on the Information button shows a screen with additional information about the student, such as her years of enrollment and other administrative data. Clicking on the Instructions button brings up a screen that tells the user how to navigate through the portfolio. <p>        When the user clicks on the Main Menu button on the Introductory screen, the portfolio moves to the Main Menu screen. The design of the portfolio begins with an answer to the first question of planning backwards: What should a graduate know and be able to do? In our example, we have used the Kentucky Education Reform Act's six "learning goals," each of which comprises a number of outcomes. (The state has defined seventy-five outcomes under these six goals.) The six learning goals are listed on the left side of the screen. Again, these particular goals are simply an example; the set of goals used in any school's portfolio would be established by the local community.<p>        Our prototype contains an additional column of goals to the right of the six primary learning goals. The right-hand column represents the subgoals of Goal 2, Core Concepts. Goal 2 is divided into smaller sections, primarily because the design of the portfolio parallels in many ways how teachers organize paper portfolios. If a student filed all of his or her work in folders representing the six learning goals, the folder for the Core Concepts would be bursting at the seams. Thus, our Main Menu provides folders for what Kentucky has defined as the six "core concept areas" of learning: science, mathematics, social sciences, arts and humanities, living skills, vocational studies. <p>        The names of the goals -- Communication, Self-Sufficiency, and so on -- require some elaboration. Clicking on the round button next to a goal (or subgoal under Core Concepts) brings up a window showing the outcomes associated with that goal. In our example, the detailed description consists of the outcomes defined for each learning goal by the state. There is a list of outcomes associated with the goal of Communication. We can scroll down the list to see the rest of the outcomes.<p>        We imagine that when a student enters a school, he or she will be given a blank portfolio, containing only screens. The student can browse through the goals and see what it is that he or she is expected to be able to know and do before graduating. One might also expect that incoming students will want to see benchmark performances in goal areas from earlier graduates' folders. <p>        Next, we need to ask the second planning backwards question: How can a student demonstrate those skills and knowledge that a graduate should have? The Coalition refers to such demon-strations as "exhibitions," and they can take many forms: seminars, research projects, oral and written presentations, and yes, even timed tests. <p>        An exhibition is an assessment that provides the opportunity for students to demonstrate a skill or knowledge that is highly valued by the school. It grows from a vision of students performing as their teachers hoped they would. As Joe McDonald has written, an exhibition "faces inward, points out-ward, and presses deeper."4 It allows a school to see what its students have done and to show the community what the school itself is doing, and it provides grist for the conversation mill within the school and community about standards and systems. So the Digital Portfolio, with exhibitions as its core content, presents not only the student but also the values and contours of the school community.<p>        While any kind of information could go into the Digital Portfolio -- including the familiar transcript, report cards, and standardized test scores -- its strength is its ability to present authentic performance, such as exhibitions, in any media.<p> <hr><h3>Looking Into a Folder</h3><hr>                Let's consider some specific examples. How will we know if a student has demonstrated the ability to communicate or to solve problems? If we click on the folder icon next to a goal, we see a list of performances representing the student's exhibitions of that goal. <p>         This list of performances is essentially a "table of contents" for a goal. It is meant to represent the student's performances over a period of time. The list might include performances required by the school or the state, such as the entries for the twelfth-grade writing portfolio, or it might include performances that the student feels are good representations of her work. <p>         Any single performance might be a representation of more than one outcome or goal. In this example, the Waterfront exhibition is listed in both the Communications and Problem Solving folders. Because the portfolio is a hypermedia  document, multiple paths can lead to the same information -- that is, a user can get to the same point in more than one way. One advantage of the technological version of a portfolio is that we only need to retain one copy of the actual student work on the disk, no matter how many places it is filed.<p>         From this table of contents, a user can click on any of the titles to see the work. Let's suppose the user clicked on the Waterfront exhibition. <p>         On the left side of this screen is the actual student work; by scrolling through that window, the user can read the entire work as it was submitted by the student (or, as in this case, a group of students). Here we see a description of how this student group proposes to bring more people to the Louisville waterfront.<p>         The box on the right side of the screen displays additional information about the current portfolio item. The "demonstrated goals" -- meaning the outcomes that a reader should find in this piece -- are taken from the list of outcomes we saw in the Main Menu. This exhibition demonstrates a number of goals including "productive team membership" and "critical thinking skills."5 It is not, however, listed as a demonstration of "visual arts," though there is a visual component to the work; presumably, some other piece of work in the portfolio is a better demonstration of that outcome. This kind of selection and annotation can be made by the student, building in a reflective dimension to her school career. <p>         One advantage of the digital portfolio is its ability to store multiple media. Graphics, for example, are incorporated into this student's work. Below the text are three buttons, labeled Video, Audio, and Graphic. Clicking on the Graphic button displays a list of graphics that the student has created for her presentation. Our example shows a sketch done by the student that was included with the project. In this case, the sketch was drawn by hand and scanned into the portfolio; drawings created by computer paint, drawing, and animation programs can be included in the portfolio as well.<p>         Returning to the Goals screen, the menu along the bottom of the screen allows us to look at other aspects of the exhibition. Clicking on the Assignment button brings up another screen.<p>         Again, on the left is the student work. On the right of this screen is the project description, the assignment that the student received from the teacher. Having a view of the assignment helps to put the performance in context; if one understands the constraints of the assignment, one is better able to judge the student work.<p>         The menu bar now contains a Goals button. It also contains a button labeled Evaluation. If we click on the Evaluation button, we see a new screen.<p>         The right side of the screen now contains a list of evaluators. If we click on any of the evaluators in this list, we will see an evaluation of the student work. Presumably, there will be a teacher evaluation for all items in a portfolio. The prototype allows for the student and other judges to evaluate the work as well. In fact, any reader may add an evaluation "on the fly" by clicking on the top line of the evaluators list and entering comments in a text box. <p>         In our example, we can see the rubric used by the teacher in evaluating the project. If we scroll down the list, we can see what an "A" project represents, what a "B" project represents, and so on. The outside evaluators for this exhibition were representatives from the city's office of planning and development, whose evaluation of the exhibition offers other insights to the student work.<p> <hr><h3>Design Issues</h3><hr>The Digital Portfolio prototype, as it exists now, contains information for just one student. As such, it contains useful information about a student's abilities and can provide a demonstration of growth over time. Imagine, for example, storing a recorded oral presentation in each of the four years of a student's high school career. This longitudinal dimension, so valued by teachers, is woefully underserved by the documentation we currently maintain on students.<p>         It can also place student work in a context. Rather than simply identifying papers and projects as "best work," it identifies that a particular piece of work is a "best" demonstration of a particular outcome. Still, further elements need to go into the design. We assume that some users -- for instance, college admissions officers -- may want to see more than one student's work at a time. We need to design a multimedia database that allows easy searches through multiple portfolios, and that can answer queries such as, "Show me outstanding performances in writing portfolios" or "Show me all the science folders for my incoming chemistry class." Students can also see what valued outcomes they need to fulfill before they graduate and benchmark performances by recent graduates.<p>         A database does not imply, though, that all student information should be available for all to view. Students should be seen as the owners of their own work. While a school should be able to retain a copy of some work as evidence of a student's performance, and may physically store the student work, the student should have at least some degree of control of what is included in the portfolio. For example, the school might legiti-mately require a writing sample; the particular sample that is submitted should be chosen by the student.<p>         We need to answer the question, "What information is useful?" The answer, we presume, would be different for different audiences. We might presume that a student would want to keep everything that he or she produced in one version of the portfolio, and that the school would maintain a subset of that material as the "transcript." The school and the student might reduce that information even further for other audiences (e.g., college admissions officers, employers, accreditation agencies), combining selected exhibitions with more traditional information (test scores, grades, records of participation in clubs, sports, and so on). <p> <hr><h3>Technical Considerations</h3><hr>        There are also technical hurdles to be overcome. Multimedia documents -- particularly video clips -- occupy a great deal of disk space. (One earlier prototype, with about four minutes total of non-compressed video, occupies about twenty mega-bytes on a hard disk.) With hundreds or thousands of students developing portfolios within a school, issues of storing bits of information are just as real as issues of storing paper copies of everything. Still, compression technologies (such as Intel's Digital Video Interactive) and read-write optical storage media (for example, a "writable" CD-ROM) are making such storage more viable.<p>         In addition, we would want to communicate this information across distances -- some distances as short as between classrooms, some as long as from a school to a state education department. Networked multi-media is still in its early stages; transmitting large amounts of data across wires is not as fast or as efficient as it needs to be. Again, though, much work is being done in this area, from advanced forms of local-area networking to the development of the "information superhighway." <p>         Because multimedia storage and networking are issues that touch most every application of computing, the computer scientists and engineers of academia and industry are committing great resources to creating reasonable solutions to these problems. The solutions are some time away, but we can anticipate the initial technological solutions fairly quickly -- in less time, perhaps, than it will take for the educational establishment to embrace alternative assessments across the board. To that end, the digital portfolio represents a vision of what is possible.<p> <hr><h2>Using the Portfolio in School</h2><hr>        Let's assume then that we have all of the technical kinks worked out, and that the design of the portfolio and database have been established. Now, how would a school use this tool? In essence, we are now asking the third of our planning backwards questions: <i>How do we arrange our systems so that students will be able to exhibit the desired skills and knowledge? </i>We present here conjectures, some based on the work being done by schools that are pilot testing the Digital Portfolio (Eastern High School in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and Thayer High School in Winchester, New Hampshire), and some based on our theoretical musings.<p>         A school's first step would be to determine what it wants its students to know and be able to do. This means that the labels on the folders in the Main Menu would vary from school to school and from state to state. Most schools have some kind of listing of goals and outcomes, but often those are collecting dust in a filing cabinet.6 By providing every student and every teacher with a copy of those goals, and a reason to know them, the goals have a better chance of driving instruction and learning in the school. <p>         Then the exhibitions need to be established. That is, teachers and students need to determine what will be in the "table of contents" for each folder. Many Essential schools involved in planning backwards are establishing their own goals and exhibitions. Even within more structured frameworks, such as Kentucky's, there is much room for improvisation and experimentation.<p> <a name = "eastern"><hr><h3>Eastern: Using "Student Power"</h3><hr>                A next step is to tie classroom activities to the portfolio-bound work. At Eastern High School, during the 1993-94 school year, members of the senior class are putting together digital portfolios. (The hope is that what this class does this year can be applied to the school as a whole in the next year.) The students will certainly be including those pieces that are part of the required state portfolio for twelfth-graders in writing. In addition, students will select pieces from other classes.<p>         When a student enters an item into the portfolio, he or she needs to know what outcomes are being demonstrated. The faculty has discussed developing a system where students can seek the counsel of a "portfolio advisor" on the faculty to determine which outcomes have been met by that work. Ideally, teachers will be able to tell students which outcomes are being addressed before the students begin their work; the goals of the school need to permeate and shape its activities.<p>         Logistically, students and faculty need access to equipment; however, we do not assume that every student and every teacher needs his or her own machine. The approach at Eastern takes advan-tage of an important technical resource: student power. Two groups of students are involved. First, the seniors who are creating their portfolios are responsible for getting their work into digital form. When possible, they will word-process or otherwise use computers to generate their work in the first place. However, they also have access to the school's scanners to input work that they have not previously digitized. The school also has a video camera and audio recording devices, which will be used by the students to record performances or to annotate their work. The students who are putting portfolios together are responsible for making sure a video camera is in the room when a performance is being given or for recording significant elements in the process of a project.<p>         Second, a group of about twenty students is providing support for the first group. This second group is taking a class in multimedia, learning the intricacies of hypermedia systems such as Toolbook. The teacher, Scott Horan, makes an analogy between this production staff and the school newspaper staff. Just as some students write articles and other students lay out the paper, the seniors will put their work into digital form (and determine in which folder the work will reside), and the portfolio production team will provide the technical support to place the work in the digital portfolio. The construction of the digital portfolios in schools can itself become an "episode of learning."7<p>         The school has arranged systems so that students can provide maximum support for each other. Mr. Horan's class takes place during the lunch period, allowing the portfolio production team to find and assist other students as the need arises.<p>         The faculty, of course, plays a key role in helping to make the portfolios happen. Portfolio advisors for groups of students can help to map the student work to the outcomes and help the students determine what is "best" work. The implication, of course, is that the faculty needs to be consistent in determining what is "good enough" to go into the portfolio and which pieces show mastery of the corresponding goals. Eastern also has the benefit of a local-area network established for teachers, which allows for sharing of electronic mail and other information. More importantly, it has developed a culture where teachers will talk with each other about student work and about standards of achievement. <p> <a name = "thayer"><hr><h3>Thayer: Using Portfolios to Enhance Change</h3><hr>                The development at Thayer has been somewhat different. There, the portfolio protocol has been articulated for the entire school; Thayer has a list of nineteen graduation skills in place of Kentucky's seventy-five outcomes. <p>         Thayer is a much smaller school than Eastern, and the school is already designed to get to know students well. Almost all the teachers belong to teams that work with one group of students in all of their subject areas.8<p>         Computer support is provided by a teacher, Rick Durkee, and the area computing coordinator, Tom Warner. While there is no organized class, student power is still in evidence at the school; the kids know who among them has an interest in com-puters, and they seek help when necessary.<p>         At Thayer, the development of digital portfolios represents an addition of technology to an existing structure. Since teachers already have advisories where they talk with students about their work and a portfolio system that allows students to collect their work, the process of adding the Digital Portfolio is "merely" the process of employing the technology within an existing structure.<p>         This strategy works at Thayer, we believe, because the school has already changed its structure from many of the traditional norms. It is highly probable that the Digital Portfolio would be an overwhelming burden for a school that had not changed its systems of assessment and its use of time. The Digital Portfolio makes assessment much more public and thus focuses conversations in the school on the issues of standards and student achievement. A teacher cannot simply close the classroom door when the assignments and evaluations she provides will be as much a part of the student record as the student work itself. <p>         In fact, we would propose the following hypothesis: the most important thing in the adoption and adaptation of a new technological tool is the culture of the school. A school that is willing to change will find the possibilities in the new tool; a school that is reluctant to change will find the burdens. Further work with Digital Portfolios will provide many tests of this hypothesis.<p> <hr><h3>Future Issues</h3><hr>        The experiments at Eastern and Thayer will help define some of the issues of implementing the Digital Portfolio, including the time and space requirements needed to put them together, and the technological requirements for maintaining them. Once we have begun to collect some actual student work, we can begin to address the next set of questions. How would outside audiences -- parents, colleges, businesses, states, and so on -- use these portfolios? What additional features are neces-sary? How would those within the school use the portfolios? How would a school handle issues of confidentiality and access to student information? We plan to have conversations during the coming year with these audiences -- conversations built around actual student work as represented in the digital portfolios.<p>         We can imagine many possibilities for the use of digital portfolios, but as often happens with technology, imagination runs far ahead of reality. Our primary goal, however, is not techno-logical; rather it is to devise a tool that can help schools develop a richer picture of what students are capable of doing.<p> <hr><h2>Footnotes</h2><hr><ol><li> Grant Wiggins, panelist for "Performance Assessment: Exploring the Role of Performance Criteria and Standards," Education Commission of the States/Colorado Department of Education Con-ference on Alternative Assessment, Breckenridge, CO, June 1991.<p><li> The concept for the Digital Portfolio was developed by David Niguidula.

<html><head><title>CES: Publications: Research Papers: Keeping Student Performance Central</title></head><body><h1><center>Keeping Student Performance Central:Building a New York Assessment Collection</center></h1><hr><h3><center>by David Allen and Joseph McDonald, Coalition of Essential Schools</center></h3><center>October, 1993</center><hr><p> <i>The Coalition of Essential Schools gratefully acknowledges the IBM Corporation and the UPS Foundation for their support of its research on Exhibitions.</i><p><i>Joseph McDonald has headed the IBM Exhibitions project for the pastthree years. David Allen, who joined the project in 1992, willcoordinate development of the New York Assessment Collection.A slightly different version of this paper will appear in a monographto be published by the New York State Council of EducationalAssociations.</i><p><hr>        Educators now find themselves at the intersection of two rapidlyadvancing technologies. Both are sometimes touted as saviors for ourfailing schools. Both are looked upon hopefully, but with a measureof skepticism and anxiety by already overworked school people. Likeall technologies, both have the danger of shifting attention fromwhat really matters --in the case of schooling, student performance --to the technologies themselves.<p>        The first of these technologies is more easily identified assuch: the computer driven revolution in communication, with its CD-ROMs, LANs, modems, electronic mail networks, and more and morepowerful computers. While school budgets keep such tools outside theimmediate circle of concerns for many, school people sense themlooming and already infiltrating some schools and districts."Preparing students for the twenty-first century" is a mission widelyadopted by schools, with an implicit agenda involving information andcommunication tools. But little has been done to develop the capacityto deliver on such a promise, in terms of equipment especially, aswell as the professional development necessary to utilize it andteach it or the reorganization of schools and systems to support it(Cuban, 1992).<p>        The second technology of interest here is a technology ofassessment. Calls for better accountability, along withdissatisfaction with current reliance on standardized tests andtextbook derived exams, have given rise to a movement towardperformance assessment (Mitchell, 1992). As with computers, thistechnology is already a presence in schools, though rarely central tothe schooling that goes on there. Even so, more and more states suchas New York (as well as Kentucky, California, and Vermont) haveinitiated reform of assessment practice placing a premium onperformance assessment.<p>        New York's New Compact for Learning, adopted by the state Boardof Regents in 1991, calls for assessments of student performance thatare as authentic as possible, representing realworld tasks andsituations requiring higher-order thinking and complex, integratedperformances (New York State Curriculum and Assessment Council,1992, p. v). How will schools begin to develop the capacity for thiskind of assessment practice?<p>        In 1990, the IBM Corporation underwrote a project at theCoalition of Essential Schools to explore the intersection of thesetwo technologies, looking particularly at how that intersection mightaffect the design of the public high school. The three-year studythat followed has resulted in a number of publications, particularlyconcerning a strategy for school change termed "planning backwards"(McDonald, 1992), and in the development of several promising toolsto support school change. The publications and the tools reflect acore idea of the Coalition of Essential Schools; namely, that studentperformance should be central, not marginal, to the work of schools.<p>        One of the tools we have developed is "The ExhibitionsCollection,"1 a computer sampler of more than thirty actualperformance assessments, mainly from Essential schools. Since itsrelease in 1992, the collection has been widely used in schoolsacross the country. This kind of resource for schools appealedespecially to New York State's Council for Curriculum and Assessment,which is charged with creating student outcome standards, curriculumframeworks, and assessment strategies as part of the New Compact forLearning.<p><hr><h3>The New York Assessment Strategy</h3><hr>        The New Compact's general assessment strategy represents asignificant shift from pencil and paper testing to performanceassessments, including an emphasis on student portfolios andexhibitions. Since the New Compact also calls for performanceassessment systems to be locally developed and to be compatible withstate goals, it requires a dramatic change in the roles of the StateEducation Department, the districts, and individual schools:The State should encourage local practitioners to develop innovativeand thoughtful assessment programs by inviting local initiatives andsupporting local development with assess-ment options. Among theresources the State can provide is access to a portfolio or bank ofassessment ideas, tasks, and instruments [emphasis added]. (New YorkState Curriculum and Assessment Council, 1992, p. 11)<p>        Members of the Council and team leaders from the State EducationDepartment, along with the staff of the Coalition's ExhibitionsProject and our IBM colleagues, saw an opportunity to take advantageof communication technology to create and disseminate such a resourcebank. In this paper, we describe how, building on our experience withthe Exhibitions Collection and our research in schools, we will builda "New York Assessment Collection."2 Through this tool, we bringtogether the potential energy of both the communication andperformance assessment technologies in a format most relevant toeducators in that it keeps student performance central to its contentand design."<p><hr><h3>The Six Dimensions of Assessment</h3><hr>        Before we describe the New York Assessment Collection and thecommunication technology that underlies it, we'll briefly summarizethe findings about performance assessment that have emerged from ourresearch and shape our technological development.<p>        Every assessment that calls for authentic performance is reallya system of interacting elements. We have identified six components,or dimensions, that inhere in every good assessment, no matter howdifferent in form each assessment may be from another: for example,one student's individual exhibition on the concept of whole numbersand an entire class's simultation of a U.N. peace conference.<p>        Our six dimensions of assessment are:<p><ol>        <li>      Vision        <li>     Prompt        <li>     Coaching context        <li>     Performance       <li>   Standards       <li>    Reflection</ol><p>        There are two points to be made about these six dimensions.First, they are not always easy to differentiate; for example,coaching context or instruction may overlap in subtle ways withstudent performance. Second, whereas in the past, the design criteriafor assessments were often limited to a linear schema (assignmentÐperformance assessment), our experience suggests that these sixdimensions are nonlinear and therefore constantly interacting withone another.<p>        When illustrated by assessments actually used in schools, thesedimensions have become useful as trail markers for schools as theybegin to design assessments for their students. It follows that anytechnology that supports performance assessment should pay heed tothese dimensions and the complexity of the system of assessment theyconstitute.<p><hr><h3>Goals For the NY Assessment Collection</h3><hr>        The primary goal for the New York Assessment Collection is thatit portray a variety of real performance assessments from New Yorkschools in a format that is useful for educators as they developtheir own assessments. What do these performance assessments looklike? How do they work? In creating the collection, we have drawnupon the six dimensions above as the key design element for the toolitself. As we discuss each dimension in the context of thecollection, we suggest a few assessment design criteria that haveemerged for each.<p>        The second goal for the collection is to make use of technologyreadily available to teachers now and to anticipate a time when farmore powerful technologies will be available to them. How willeducators take advantage of these technologies? In the section thatfollows, we describe how an existing technology --hypermedia --allowsus to portray assessments and disseminate them in a format accessibleright now. Later, we'll look at some possible adaptations for theinformation technologies of the (not too distant) future.<p><hr><h3>What Is Hypermedia?</h3><hr>        Before we turn to the six dimensions of the AssessmentCollection, it will be useful to understand what hypermedia is andhow it supports our goals for the collection.<p>        Hypermedia3 refers to a computer document in which informationis stored in pieces, called nodes. Rather than being organized in alinear fashion, as with a wordprocessing document, the nodes arelinked to each other in the same way cities and towns are linked byroads. By clicking on buttons on the screen, the user --not thedesigner --chooses the path by which the information is accessed.<p>        Hypermedia represents a promising technology for all kinds ofuses in education because it encourages students to discover thelinks between bits of knowledge. Hypermedia documents can incorporatetext, graphics, scanned photographs --even audio --in place of atraditional report (Scheidler, 1993).<p>        We chose hypermedia as a vehicle for disseminating the New YorkAssessment Collection because we view assessments as complex systemsof interrelated components, rather than linear progressions fromassignment to test. The hypermedia document we are creatingencourages users to explore the assessments as they choose, holdingup one part against another to judge for coherence, fairness, anddepth.<p>        The "tour" that follows demonstrates how hypermedia allows usersto "view" an assessment.<p><hr><h2>A Tour of the New York Assessment Collection</h2><hr>        It is important to note that the tool we describe here4 is now only aprototype, a "shell" we will fill with real examples of assessmentsfrom New York elementary and secondary schools. We welcome feedbackon the design, as well as assessments that might be included in thecollection.<p>        The best way to tour a user-friendly computer application, ofcourse, is to sit down in front of your own computer and experimentwith it. Nonetheless this paper format allows for some of ourobservations about the choices we've made in designing thecollection.<p><hr><h3>The Assessments Menu</h3><hr>        The collection opens with an introductory screen that includespurposes, information about the New Compact for Learning, and somecriteria for "assessing assessments," but we'll begin our tour at themenu screen. The menu is really the nexus of the collection,and so always a choice on the screen. Here the user can choose toview any one of the assessments included. (In this prototype, onlythe first two are from New York schools.)<p>        The commencement-level5 assessments menu represents one of threemenu screens; assessments will be divided into elementary,intermediate and commencement. The viewer clicking on the firstassessment listed --the Senior Institute at Central Park EastSecondary School (CPESS)6 --is automatically placed into the first ofthe six dimensions by which each assessment is portrayed, the vision. Along the righthand side, the buttons for all sixdimensions allow users to move around within the assessment as theychoose.<p><hr><h3>Vision</h3><hr>        Assessments are often led by the assignment, or prompt, and notby any vision of actual student performance. The emphasis thereforefalls not on what students are actually doing, but on whether theassignment itself is clever or fits neatly into the curriculum. Thisis why we've chosen to begin looking at each assessment with thevision, and we encourage frequent revisiting of the vision as theuser examines the other dimensions of the assessment, includingactual student performances --an advantage of hypermedia.<p>        The vision represents the image of performance that underliesthe assessment. Often, as is the case at CPESS, this image will bepart of the school's vision of its ideal graduate. In elementaryschools especially, it may be associated with an idea of childdevelopment, and in every school with what it means to be asuccessful and fulfilled human being.<p>        Criteria for designing an assessment might pose these questions:<p><ol>       <li>      Is the vision simple and coherent?      <li>    Is it "grounded" (for example, in the "habits of mind"valued at CPESS; elsewhere perhaps in the National Council ofTeachers of Mathematics standards or the New Compact outcomes)?       <li>     Is it expressed, in David Perkins's phrase, as an"understanding performance"? (see Perkins, 1992, pp. 77Ð79).</ol><p><hr><h3>Prompt</h3><hr>        From vision, the user may choose to follow any path in viewingthe assessment. Most typically, one will turn to the prompt, orassignment. The prompt defines the work of the assessment for boththe teacher and the student. It may be brief (with details left tocoaching context) or elaborate and complex, as with CPESS's SeniorInstitute, which involves putting together a portfolio offourteen separate items and performances.<p>        Design criteria that may help to develop the prompt, in additionto careful consideration of the vision, might include questions suchas the following:<p><ol>        <li>     Is it authentic --derived from something outside pureschoolwork?        <li>     Does it ask students to do something that matters?       <li>      Is it essential to the domain in which the student isworking, rather than peripheral to it?</ol><p><hr><h3>Standards</h3><hr>        From here, the user might choose to look at the standards thataccompany the performance. Standards are the explicit criteriaagainst which the performance is judged. They provide the mark toshoot for and so must be available to students up front, not hiddenfrom them. These criteria derive from an analysis of the vision, butalso seek to answer two questions:<p><ol>        <li>      Where is this student's performance in relation to thevision?       <li>      How can we help the student reach higher?</ol><p>        With all the talk about standards, "world class" and otherwise,it is all too rare to see them applied to actual student performance.As we've written earlier, standards "come to life in the face ofperformance, then fade in clarity and power as images from theperformance fade" (Sizer, McDonald and Rogers, 1992/93, p. 30). Thecollection encourages users to jump from the standards to actualimages of performance and back to standards --bringing in vision andcoaching context as well --to check for validity and fairness.<p>        The guiding design criterion that might be applied to standardsis, borrowing a phrase from Grant Wiggins, What are "the most salientand insightful discriminators in judging [this] performance"?(Wiggins, 1992, p. 26). Against these discriminators, the school maydevelop indicators of level (for example, beginner, apprentice, andexpert) and begin to compile benchmarks for each level.<p><hr><h3>Performances</h3><hr>        Performance is central to the whole enterprise of assessment. Inour Exhibitions Collection we generally included just one sample ofauthentic student work. In the New York Assessment Collection, wewill provide multiple examples at different levels of studentperformance (with an indication of how each has been assessedaccording to the standards). Initially all the samples will be text-or graphics-based (with an accompanying videotape), but in futuremultimedia versions, digitized video and audio of studentperformances will be included. <p>        The performances are the student responses to the prompt. Theyshould live on in the school, through careful documentation andarchiving, to become benchmarks for subsequent performers and judges.They also function as benchmarks here for considering each assessmentincluded in the collection --the user should put the actualperformance up against the vision, the standards, and the coachingcontext to check for coherence and adherence to vision.<p><hr><h3>Coaching Context</h3><hr>        The coaching context is meant to be more than just the logisticsthat support the performance. If we believe that good assessmentsprovoke students to delve deeper or stretch farther, then thecoaching that surrounds performance is crucial. It might includeconsultation, schedules, tools, technical advice, formative critique,peer collaboration, a timely push, a word of support, or even asupport strategically withheld. At CPESS, the coaching contextincludes putting together and meeting with a graduation committee.<p>        As with performances, future versions of the collection may beenhanced with video images of the coaching context, so that in theCPESS assessment, for example, the viewer might see an excerpt from aconference with the student's graduation committee.<p>        Some criteria for coaching context might be derived from thesequestions:<p><ol>        <li>     Is it strategic --with an image of performance in mind?       <li> Is it illustrative --full of images of good performance?     <li>     Is it equitable --flexible enough to provide resources tothe students who really need them when they need them?</ol><p><hr><h3>Reflection</h3><hr>        The sixth dimension is reflection. In one sense, the entireAssessment Collection is intended to foster reflection --individualand collective. Because it brings real performances out into theopen, it provides educators (and potentially students and parents)something on which to reflect. Very often the reflection component ofthe Exhibitions Collection is comprised of just one teacher'sreflection, often taken from a brief interview after theperformances: What worked? What would I change? The New YorkAssessment Collection will include reflections from the teachersinvolved, of course, but also from students, outside judges, andperhaps even state education team leaders. In a future version of thecollection, the reflections screen will offer built-in access to anelectronic bulletin board, allowing users to ask the developers ofthe assessment questions such as: Why did you choose a collaborativeproject? and How did you assess computational skills?<p>        Ultimately, we believe that reflection must be "built into"every assessment. It is the element of the system that monitors thesystem itself, collecting and analyzing feedback from performances,performers, and judges. It may pose questions about the reliabilityand fairness of the system. It may also "tune" the assessment toexternal values, including, in New York, the aims of the New Compact.<p>        Questions that may serve as criteria for schools as they thinkabout building or enhancing reflective capacity are:<p><ol>        <li>    Does it provide feedback to the students?        <li>      Does it supply feedback to the faculty about the systemitself?        <li>    Does it provide both "warm" and "cool" feedback? (seeMcDonald, 1993).</ol><p><hr><h2>Taking Advantage of the Technologies of Tomorrow</h2><hr>        The first versions of the New York Assessment Collection will bedisseminated, like the existing Exhibitions Collection, on diskette.This makes the information it contains accessible to every schoolwith an IBM-compatible or Macintosh computer. We are anticipating atime when schools will have access to far more powerful technologyfor sharing information. Two fast approaching developments with whicheducators have just begun to contend are multimedia and "data highways."<p>        Multimedia is really just the logical next step from hypermedia,integrating video, sound, text, and graphics into single documents ordatabases. When this technology becomes more accessible to schools,how will they use it? The Assessment Collection offers one possibleanswer. The sharing of good assessment practice will be more powerfulwhen schools and educators are able to view video clips of studentperformances, coaching sessions, even reflective feedbackdiscussions, along with the written descriptions of these dimensions.<p>        Other uses of multimedia by schools might be the development ofa "digital school profile" to portray the school's systems toparents, community members, and other stakeholders, or a "digitalstudent portfolio" (Niguidula, 1993) to portray a student's academicgrowth with new depth.<p>        The second advance will be in communications technology.Already, national and regional networks (the Internet, NYCENet,NYSERNet) connect educators and researchers electronically. In thenext decade, the capacity to access information and communicateinstantly with other educators across a national 'data highway' willbecome available to nearly every school in the country. Not only willwe be able to communicate words but --via fiber-optic networks --video and sound as well.<p>        The implications for elementary and secondary education aretremendous and openended. Already some teachers take advantage of theInternet to put their students in touch with others around the world(West, 1993). But how will teachers use these technologies tocommunicate with each other?<p>        Again, we suggest that the Assessment Collection presents astarting point. As the national discussion --or debate --aboutstandards continues, teachers need means to communicate about studentperformance. They need to be able to see actual student performancesfrom other schools, discuss assessments with other educators,question each other about aspects of their work. Of course, theseconversations can happen in many forums. Some of these should beelectronic.<p>        As mentioned above, we will build into the Assessment Collectiona hook-up to electronic mail, so that viewers can enter into dialogwith the assessment's creators. This is just a first step toward thepoint where educators are regularly viewing and discussing studentperformance, but one teachers must take so that the technologyrevolution supports their work, not the other way around.<p><hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><hr>        Both the technologies referred to in this paper, communicationand performance assessment, are at once enormously exciting andintimidating, especially in their capacity to put new strains on ouralready overburdened systems of schooling. Historically, the socialorganization of schools has dealt with new technologies by keepingthem at the margins of instruction, rather than allowing them tosubstantially affect it (Cohen, 1988; Cuban, 1992). Thesetechnologies, with all the good they offer, will remain at themargins as long as student performance itself is marginalized.<p>        The power of these two technologies, as we conceive of it, liesin their capacity to bring student performance to the center ofschooling. Where performance assessment differs from assessmenttechnologies of the past (for example, standardized testing) is inits basic tenet that images of authentic student performance --not anabstraction of it --guide all aspects of instruction and assessment.<p>        This strategy is not without its critics. When we showed theprototype of the Assessment Collection at a conference recently, aneducator homed in on a syntactical error made in one of the samplesof student performance. He insisted that not only did the errorinvalidate the worth of the assessment described, but of the entirecollection. It is no wonder that teachers have been hesitant to sharestudent performance publicly. Until we develop tools and protocolsfor discussing work within and among schools, we will continue toconcentrate on what goes into the system of schooling rather than whocomes out of it.<p>        In our development of communications technology, we insist thatwe cannot talk about assessment without the student performances;they are essential and central to the technological tool we willcreate, the New York Assessment Collection. As communicationtechnology advances beyond this modest tool, and educators developthe capacity to use that technology, it will be vital to keep studentperformance --Tamika's exhibition on urban planning, Tony's communityservice portfolio --at the heart of technology use. Only by keepingour eyes on the real goal of schooling will we keep from being lostat the intersection of technologies, and rather be in a position totake advantage of the choices it offers.<p><hr><h2>References</h2><hr><dl><dd>Cohen, D.

From a batteredclassroom inrural New Hampshire, high school kids organize a three-daynationalstudent conference in Washington, D.C. on schoolchange-logging on to anelectronic network to attract peers from schools across thecountry. Ina cafeteria in Louisville every day, kids at a special tablecollecttheir classmates' latest sports or academic prowess-on tapesand disksthat will become a compact and permanent part of theirrecords. And inteacher mailboxes in urban Chicago, new teaching ideas fromall acrossthe country regularly show up-downloaded from e-mail thatlinksthousands of educators and researchers.<p>   From video cameras to the CD-ROM database, from e-mail tothe digitalportfolio, technology is education's new darling, promisinga rosy worldof progress to schools and communities hungry for schoolimprovement.But when Essential school people at these and other schoolstalked abouttechnology in a range of recent interviews, they temperedtheirenthusiasm with cautious pragmatism. Rather than put thetechnologicalcart before the horse of classroom change, they warn,schools must firstfocus on what their core issues are then use technologywisely indevising new approaches.<p>   "When Essential schools plan backwards from their goals,they seetechnology as a tool, not an end," says David Niguidula, whohas workedfor several years with technological issues at the CoalitionofEssential Schools. "Member schools are usually striving tobreak downthe professional isolation of teachers, to reach andchallenge kids atvery different levels, to assess student progress in richand concreteways-all things that technology can greatly help achieve."<p>   And although the flood of newfangled systems and productsoftenproves more daunting than dazzling to busy school people,Niguidulapredicts that within a short time the technologicalmarketplace willbecome as commonplace and easy to use as the television andtelephone."Ten years from now, for instance, students or teachersresearchingsomething electronically will have no more trouble than theydo using alibrary now," he says. "In the meantime, you can do a lotalready ifyou're willing to invest a little time and effort."<p>   But how quickly should educators move to embrace newtechnology thatoften proves obsolete as soon as people pay for it? How canthey createa synergy between technology and restructuring, using one tobolster andinspire the other? As Essential schools pick their gingerlyway throughthe technological jungle, how can they keep their sightsfocused ongetting all students to use their minds well? Some answersmay emergethrough looking at several key areas of Essential Schoolchange andexamining how technology can speed progress in each.<p><hr><h2>Student as Info-Age Worker</h2><hr>The Coalition's governing metaphor of "student as worker,"which asksstudents to "learn how to learn" with their teachers ascoaches, mesheswell with the potential uses of technology. Once theschool's door opensonto virtually unlimited access to information, a profoundshift inpedagogy often seems necessary and logical. Electronic toolsare ideallysuited to individual and small-group work, whether thatmeansdiscussions generated by role-playing computer softwarepackages, astudent's video documentary presented as a course-levelexhibition, or asolo research project using on-line university librarysources. And theycan help with many of the problems associated withchallenging studentswith widely different academic backgrounds.<p>   "Technology has transformed our ability to work withheterogeneousgroups," says Kathy Pelles, who directs New York City'sSchool of theFuture, where 370 students in grades 7 through 10 use anelectroniclibrary and writing lab, multimedia lab, telecommunicationslab, opticaldata center, and various classroom computers. "In oneSpanish class wecan have kids at six different proficiency levels, having e-mailconversations at their own level with other kids from aschool inVermont." The teacher facilitates and monitors student work,Pellessays, but "often the kids know more about technology thanthe teachers,so they collaborate with and help other kids." Teachers pairup to workwith a technology specialist, which tends to generate teamstrategies asthey discover new areas to explore.<p>   Small-group work also springs naturally from the use ofcomputers andvideo technology. Four or five kids sharing a video cameracan puttogether a project combining several media, for example. Orsimulationsoftware can generate realistic situations on one classroomcomputer,with teams of students working out solutions in smallergroups. "Noamount of interactive technology can substitute for dynamichumaninteractivity," warns David Dockterman of Tom SnyderProductions, whohas developed a number of classroom software programs thatare geared tostimulate thoughtful discussions in the one-computerclassroom. "Butvideos and computers can often spark that by setting uplearning in arich narrative context-which is how people learn thingsbest."<p>   Merely to deal with the amount of information explodingintostudents' lives, Kathy Pelles observes, teaching tasks mustaim todevelop what School of the Future calls students' "GUMSskills"-getting,understanding, manipulating, and synthesizing information."We askedkids to make hypermedia stacks about whether our school ruleonoffensive language violated their right to free speech, forexample,"she says. "It took time for them to figure out what to putinto thestack, how to make comparisons and contrasts, how to presentthematerial persuasively."<p>   In fact, students working with computer hypercard stacksto selectand organize information are often using their minds inquite differentways from their pencil-wielding predecessors, observeshumanitiesteacher Kathy Juarez, who teaches at Piner High School inSanta Rosa,California. "It's important to acknowledge that technologycan stretchour mental boundaries," she says. "We now have the power todo things wehaven't even imagined before." Piner teachers believe thatstudents mustbe trained to use technological tools to negotiate theirfuturesuccessfully; they are discussing a new list of desired high-tech skillsthat dovetail nicely, they say, with their Essential Schoolgoals.<p>   On the other side of the coin, many worry that electronicshort-cutswill seduce schools into shortchanging the three R's. Butthey can justas easily have the reverse effect- computer searches don'twork, afterall, if you can't spell the key words. In the high-techlibrary at PaulM. Hodgson Vocational-Technical High School in Newark,Delaware, forexample, a frustrated senior boy combed an on-line catalogin vain formaterials on "19th-centrey tools." Principal Steven Godowskycorrectedthe student's spelling, then made sure his English teacherfollowed upon the problem.<p>   Teaching higher-order basics, too, becomes more importantin theinformation age. "If ever there was a need for coachingstudents to usetheir minds well, it's now," says Piner's Kathy Juarez."It's naive tothink that even with technology kids are going to be able tomakemeaning of this incredible glut of information withoutlearning to makeconnections between things, ask the right questions, makelogicalselections. But that's not to say it'll have to happenwithin the fourwalls of the classroom with 30 kids." Indeed, Piner studentshaveliberal access not only to classroom computers but to theoff-line adultworld outside their school, where they work with mentors ona range ofprofessional activities.<p><hr><h2>Curriculum Changes</h2><hr>Access to technology can change curriculum, too, in waysthat reflectthe Essential School emphasis on depth in student learningand ageneralist's attitude on the part of teachers. At CatalinaFoothillsHigh School in Tucson, Arizona, science teacher Frank Draperusessophisticated computer simulations to get students thinkingabout"system dynamics"-how decisions and actions affect theworkings ofentire systems from copper mining to flu epidemics. Workingin teams atnetworked computer stations, students in one class competefor miningresources on an imaginary island, investigating nonrenewableresourcemanagement.<p>   "The computer tells them what kind of soil sample theirteam'discovers,"' Draper says. "Then they go get an actualsample from theclassroom cupboards, analyze it chemically to determine itsore yield,and enter their results in. They can construct deals totrade land withother students, trying to run a profitable company whileapplying- andassessing-their knowledge of chemistry and economics." Aftera week ofsuch grounding, students play out a number of "what if"scenarios usingcomputer modeling, through a simulation program calledSTELLA.<p>   At Chicago's Sullivan High School, where Socraticseminars drive thecurriculum, students are using IBM's modern version ofmedievalilluminated books and manuscripts; by clicking on a word inthe textthey can access interviews, background materials, andvarious otherrelated topics. It is a small step, David Niguidula pointsout, to"illuminating" their own texts similarly, opening up a newrealm ofacademic discourse. At Hope High School in Providence, RhodeIsland, KayScheidler's students have replaced their textbook with aHypercard"corpus" of material about United States history andliterature. Notonly can students access key primary sources, but they canadd to thebody of knowledge by making their own work available forreference byother students.<p>   The study of foreign languages has long benefited fromtechnology inthe form of audiovisual aids, but here too the computerconnection holdsout new approaches. Using an unusually effective softwareprogram calledTransparent Language, for instance, language students canread classictexts on screen, clicking on any word or phrase for instantelaborationof its grammar, syntax, and meaning. And a teacher at ByramHills HighSchool in Armonk, New York has her class conversing by e-mail withfellow students in France and Spain.<p>   Supported by a grant from IBM, Thayer High School inWinchester, NewHampshire is on the way to digitizing virtually everythingstudents do.In Dale Courtney's technical ed class, tenth-grader DaniHopkins deftlymanipulates the computer-assisted drafting tools she hopescould landher an architect's job some day. Next to her sits theschool'sacknowledged tech-head, Andrew Earley, who at sixteen candiscourseknowledgeably with top IBM engineers when anything goeswrong in any ofthe school's complex systems.<p>   Andy's case illustrates how technology can open up acurriculum bothto cross disciplinary boundaries and to adjust to students'individualneeds. "Andy was so uninterested in his regular courses thathe had togo to summer school last year in algebra and English," saysprincipalDennis Littky. "Finally we decided to let him devise aprogram wherebyhe can demonstrate mastery in all our nineteen skill areasthroughindependent work in technology." Andy often arrives atschool at six inthe morning and stays till late at night, Littky says,serving as theright-hand man of Thayer's director of technology, ElliotWashor.<p>   In Tom McGuire's "networking" class, a dozen Thayerstudents meetdaily to reflect on their own high school education and whatit means.They visit younger students' classes to explain the school'snewemphasis on mastering nineteen key skill areas (and new waysofdemonstrating and documenting that mastery electronically).They surveystudent opinions on what qualities they will look for in aprincipalwhen Dennis Littky retires this year. And they use e-mail toexchangeideas about school change with other students around thecountry. InApril the class will travel to Washington, D.C. for anational studentconference which their technological wizardry has helpedthem organizefrom top to bottom.<p>   "Technology is a hook," declares McGuire. "It draws kidsinto workthey wouldn't otherwise be doing." Whether that involvescollaboratingwith their peers nationwide on a scientific databasedocumenting theextent of acid rain (as a National Geographic Societyelectronic networkis doing) or functioning as respected participants ineducation reform,it has the same effect, he believes: to make theirexperience oflearning more authentic and meaningful.<p><hr><h2>Assessment and Accountability</h2><hr>The acid test of a school's success comes when kids mustdemonstratetheir intellectual progress and prowess; and newtechnologies offer arange of new assessment possibilities. By its nature muchnew technologyis performance-oriented; so videotapes, audiotapes, andhypermedia add adimension to student presentations and exhibitions. "It's ashame howmany student papers are only seen by the student and herteacher," KathyJuarez comments. "Using another form not only opens studentwork up toother viewers, but encourages us to broaden our assessmentsto include arange of student learning styles."<p>   Just as important, the larger community-parents, experts,otherteachers and students, employers, and colleges can moreeasily witnessand evaluate student work when it is made available invarious digitizedforms. With the help of an IBM grant, the Coalition isworking withThayer High School and Louisville's Eastern High School ondevelopingthe prototype of a "digital portfolio" that would documentand assessstudent progress in an elegantly accessible form. The twoefforts differin interesting ways, but both result in-a single disk or CDthat canfollow a student's progress-in still pictures, audio, video,or writtentext- through his or her entire school career.<p>   At Thayer, the technology promises to remove the burdenof multiplerecord-keeping from the school's attempt to assess studentprogresstoward nineteen skills that must be demonstrated bygraduation. "Thelogistics of documenting that is a nightmare," says RickDurkee, whooversees the school's computer technology. "We had nineteenfolders intowhich we would put any of the kids' work that met thatcompetency. Therewas a lot of duplication, and a tremendous amount of sheerbulk ofmaterials." Now students' digitized assignments can beplaced in one ormore skill folders by the team or the student herself;comments andevaluations from any number of sources go alongside, makingclear whatskill areas they demonstrate and how well they do it. <p>   At Eastern, computer wizard and science teacher ScottHoran signed up20 students in a digital portfolio class to organize theentire projectof documenting their schoolmates' work. "We treat it justlike ayearbook-no teacher has any say as to what goes in," hesays. "At theend of the year kids can take the disk home and put it ontheir mantelif they like-it's for them to display." Each student inHoran's class isthe contact person for a dozen or more outside it, who haveagreed toenter all their important accomplishments-from the bigfootball game orschool play to a recital, an exhibition, or a final paper-indigitalform. The material is collected at lunchtime, when kids fromthe digitalportfolio class sit at a special table; then they take thevideos,audios, artwork, or text and translate it into the permanentrecord.<p>"We are not editors," Horan declares. "We put in work wartsand all. Wewant students to own this whole portfolio idea before westart using itto assess them." Nonetheless, the students themselves donotice andcomment on the quality of their peers' work. "It's wellknown that kidsrespect other kids' opinions more than anyone else's," hesays, "andnext come employers and colleges. Teachers are the leastrespectedaudience."<p>   Ultimately, Eastem will also use the digital portfoliosas anassessment record, just as Thayer does- though Horan hopeskids willmaintain a non-assessment portfolio as well. BecauseKentucky'sEducation Reform Act already requires portfolio assessmentin Englishand mathematics, with science and social studies soon to beadded,Eastem is already knee-deep in file cabinets. A high-techsystem, heexpects, would solve this problem even as it presents itsown storagechallenges.<p>   "One of the reasons this is taking so long is that youneed a 2-gigabyte drive to save material on CD-ROM for 200 students,"he says."No student's portfolio is going to take up more than about20 megabytesof memory. Still, that requires a massive storagecapability-you'relooking at a large tape backup drive system." Horan, whomanages acomputer store in Louisville himself, advises schools not toplanbudgets for such projects based on what products currentlycost. "Theindustry is growing and proliferating," he says. "Priceswill comedown."<p>   Aside from acting as a superb organizing tool, what doesthe digitalportfolio add to the quality of assessment practices? Amongbothteachers and students, its developers hope, it can raiseawareness ofwhat each task reveals about student learning. It canprovideinstantaneous comparisons of student work across thespectrum and atseveral points during the school career. And it can spark ausefuldialogue between student and teacher as the work includedundergoesrevision along the way.<p>   "My view is that teacher and student must go through along-termnegotiation aimed at raising the quality of the initialwork," says MarkGordon, a school librarian who recently moved from New YorkCity'sCentral Park East Secondary School to Oceana High School inPacifica,California. "The digital form is ideal for teacher input."For thatmatter, portfolios could also serve to evaluate teacherfeedback, Gordonsays, raising the quality of the entire learning dialogue.<p>   Digital portfolios also could help drive meaningfulstudent work wellbefore the point of assessment, observes Judith Shlink, ateacher fromElmwood Junior-Senior High School in Elmwood, Illinois."Individualassessment portfolios would make it easier to set thestandards at thebeginning of a course, then let students move on intoindependent workor the next class as soon as they demonstrate they've metthem," shesays. "We'd like to set up classes along a coaching model,movingthrough modules that create problems for kids to solve attheir ownpace."<p>   If colleges were to accept a digital portfolio instead ofaconventional transcript, its advocates say, a criticalbarrier toserious school change might at last be breached. Only halfjokingly, oneteacher at the Coalition's 1993 Fall Forum suggested thatprestigioushigh schools not allow college recruiters to visit unlessthey couldguarantee they had the equipment to read CD-ROM portfoliosin theiradmissions offices. Employers, too, could review evidence ofrealstudent work digitally in a far more meaningful form thanschool recordsusually supply. And accreditation committees or stateeducationdepartments could select random samples from districts toget a richerpicture of school performance.<p><hr><h2>Breaking Staff Isolation</h2><hr>Aside from the many ways that technology can open upstudents' horizonsto a world of learning, it has enormous power to breakthrough thetraditional isolation of classroom teachers. At Essentialschools aroundthe country, teachers are tapping into electroniccommunicationsnetworks to trade assignments, coordinate student projects,plan andattend workshops, get information, collaborate with otherprofessionals,apply for jobs, and ask expert advice.<p>   The Illinois Alliance of Essential Schools, for instance,has linkedall its members into a powerful computer-conferencingproject calledPSInet (People Sharing Information Network). Over 4,000calls came inlast year to the project's toll-free number, as teachers andstudentscommunicated with each other, with school coaches, with thestate boardof education, with the University of Illinois, and withconsultants andon-line technical experts. The network also serves as agateway to theInternet, the worldwide electronic information highwayofferingvirtually unlimited educational and research uses.<p>   The Coalition's National ReLearning Faculty maintainclose e-mailconnections with each other and CES's central offices inProvidence,Rhode Island through a simple and powerful server called CESOnline.Some 300 people currently use the network, which isavailable through ane-mail system that has Internet access. Several dozenCoalition teachersare also communicating electronically with colleagues inHarvardUniversity's Project Zero and in the Foxfire project,through a serverestablished under the auspices of NCREST, ColumbiaUniversity's centerfor school restructuring. And dozens of interest groups aretalking vialocal electronic bulletin boards in networks like K12Net,the NationalScience Foundation's FrEdMail, the National EducationAssociation'sSchool Renewal Network, and AT&T's Long Distance LearningNetwork.<p>   An interesting example of electronic teacher talk is theSwarthmoreGeometry Project, an Internet "hub" with seven news groupsdevoted todiscussing geometry from the school level right up throughworldclasstheoreticians. Math teachers can download articles and bookreviews,public-domain software and demonstrations of populargeometry programs,and much more; and they can share assignments and seekadvice onteaching dilemmas. "We had one instance where aninternationally knownPrinceton mathematician queried a high school geometry classon theirsolution to a geometry problem," says project coordinatorAnnie Fetter."This is a simple and nonthreatening way to cross the thickblack linebetween university and high school." Citing a Roper pollthat found 95percent of biology teachers felt isolated from theirprofessionalcolleagues, the biotechnology firm Genentech also recentlylaunched anational computer network to link them with each other andwith workingscientists.<p>   Enriching professional development programs at schoolsaround thecountry is the aim of Thayer High School's monthly hour-longinteractivetelevision workshop, "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere," whichis producedby teachers, parents, and students from a crowded controlroom thatabuts the school's small library. The program goes out toanyone who hassatellite access, and scores of schools tune in to watch (ortape forlater use) video examples of authentic assessment,heterogeneousgrouping, changing math teaching practices, and a range ofEssentialSchool ideas. The program, which reaches groups in 42states, builds intime for small group discussion and invites call-inquestions by phoneor fax; it is followed immediately by a related programcalledMathWatch, which is designed specifically for matheducators.<p><hr><h2>The Implications</h2><hr>As the technological choices get bigger, broader, more mind-boggling,and more user-friendly, how likely is it that Essentialschools can andwill do much about it? A new poll by Quality Education Datashows thepercentage of districts planning to spend more on computerhardware andsoftware in the coming year is at its highest level in fiveyears. Buteven teachers who already feel comfortable with computersand whoseschools enjoy a significant technological presenceexperience realbarriers to integrating computers into their teaching,according torecent research from the Center for Technology in Education.<p>   Those barriers have much in common, moreover, with thetypicalsticking points around Essential School change in general:time toprepare new kinds of lessons; time for the classesthemselves toexperience meaningful work; people to coach students inusing new toolsand practices; and financial support from the school anddistrict, bothfor professional development and for buying high-techmaterials. On-sitesupport from colleagues and visits to exemplary schoolsproved a keyelement for successful teachers in the Center's study; sowas theteachers' willingness to learn and change, which for sometook some timeto develop. Even with the best of intentions, meaningfulchange in thisarea will take at least five years, the study concludes; andit willdepend on teachers having ample computers, support, andtime, as well asa school structure and culture that encourages professionalexperimentation.<p>   Many schools have jump-started their ventures intotechnology bymaking partnerships with the private sector; whether forpurely civic-minded or for practical marketing purposes, companies fromIBM and AT&Tto Microsoft and Apple have sunk substantial money andequipment intopublic education. But there's a danger in relying on grantsor corporateinitiatives for what districts should consider as basic aschalkboardsand file cabinets, David Niguidula warns. "Technologyacquisition,maintenance, and training should show up as a consistent andsubstantialline-item in school budgets," he asserts. As for thediscouraging rateat which new systems become obsolete, he says, if schoolstailor theirpurchases to students' learning needs, then new high-techpurchases(like new textbooks) should only happen when those learningneedsrequire them.<p>   Finally, as Deborah Meier has pointed out, no amount oftechnologycan substitute for the essential ingredient of teaching andlearning:wisdom. Indeed, the very notion of what it means to beeducated mayshift in an era when "memory" applies more readily tomachines than tohuman beings. In this view, only by grounding themselves ina commitmentto deeper, more meaningful student engagement will schoolpeople succeedin keeping their balance as the information age careensaround the comer<p><hr>               <h2>Tech Tips for School People</h2><hr><ul><li>Multi-line central school phone systems can foul upattempts totelecommunicate. A good solution is to install a fewdedicated singlelines exactly where you need them to use your modems.<p><li>No matter how fast computers are, people still take timeto learn newthings. Allow for plenty of extra time to get teachers andstudents upto speed, and for unexpected system crashes and otherglitches.<p><li>Small groups are better than large ones when you'reworking withtechnology. Rather than putting 40 teachers in a room towatchprofessional development video, feed it on networked TVsinto eightrooms where groups of five can respond and discuss it.<p><li>When kids communicate with other schools through e-mail orbulletinboards, make sure they respond to messages:. Interest injoint projectsdies quickly without contact.<p><li>One computer-savvy staffer can daily preview new materialappearing onnetwork bulletin boards, download or print whatever mightinterestteachers, and distribute it to teachers' mailboxes. Or keepa notebookin the teachers' lounge with the latest offerings.<p><li>Offer teachers two types of computer training to suitdifferentlearning styles a 30-hour course that takes themmethodically from thestart, and an intensive one-day workshop for those who liketoexperiment first and then ask questions of an expert.<p><li>Local dealers or third-party vendors may agree to offercomputertraining at a reduced price. Other sources: computer-savvyuniversitygraduate students looking for an arena in which to collectdata oneducational computer use; local community or juniorcolleges, whosecourses are often cheaper and more suited to school uses.<p><li>You don't need much in the way of equipment to getstarted; a donatedgarden-variety PC and modem will suffice fortelecommunicating. Somesoftware companies (like Word Perfect) allow schools toinstall one copyon eight machines. And many businesses will donate oldsoftware they nolonger have use for.<p><li>Make use of parents' and kids' technological expertise.Get qualifiedmothers and fathers to offer training, individual coaching,oreducational programs they might have written. And open yourclassroomcomputer labs to parents and students on weekends andevenings. Oftenkids will be adept at downloading and other procedures thatinitiallybaffle their teachers.<p><li>The Internet offers vast access to bulletin boards,conferences, anddatabases, not all of which you'll be comfortable havingstudentsinvestigate. Find a way to log into KidsNet and stay there.<p></ul><p><hr><h2>The Digital Portfolio</h2><hr>The concept for the Digital Portfolio was developed by DavidNiguidulawith the support of the IBM Corporation, as a computer-basedtool forwhat the Exhibitions Project at the Coalition has termed"planningbackwards." A first implementation was developed by RichardBourgon atthe Coalition of Essential Schools. Primary development ofthe currentprototype was done by Michelle Riconscente of the Coalitionstaff usingToolbook software from Asymetrix. An earlier prototype,developed usingLinkway Live! software from EduQuest, was created by Ms.Riconscentewith further enhancements, including development of theinterface andthe use of multimedia, developed by Terry Waltman, ErrolRosser, andJane Patla of Eduquest. Yoland Jenkins has taken the leadfor furtherdevelopment of the product at EduQuest. Revisions for thecurrentversion have come from suggestions at numerous conferencesand from thestudents and staff at Eastern High School (Jefferson County,Kentucky)and Thayer High School (Winchester, New Hampshire).<p><hr><h2>Where to Go for Help:              A Resource List for Technology and Learning</h2><h3>General guides to technology</h3><ul><li><i>Report of the Technology for Restructuring Institute, </i>ToniM.

If we can't talk to the student personally -- and even if we can -- we rely on records. For the most part, a student record con-sists of two things: grades on a transcript and stan-dardized test scores. If a potential employer wants to know if the graduate has the ability to write a business report, she has to make do with a "B-" in English 2 or a 530 on the verbal portion of the SAT -- or, even more generally, something like a 2.85 grade-point average or a 57th percentile marking.<p>        Grant Wiggins suggests this experiment.1 Go into any sports bar and ask, "Who's the best active major league baseball player?" In the ensuing argument, you'll hear about the quality of a catcher's defensive play or the leadership he brings to the team. You'll hear a bunch of numbers, too, from home runs to batting averages to errors, and arguments over which numbers are more significant. The truth is that any sports fan knows that no one statistic can capture a player's entire career -- even the tables of fine print on the back of every baseball card cannot entirely replicate images of play lodged in a fan's memory (or video collection). Yet, we have a tendency to reduce academic careers to just a few numbers.<p>        We can gain a better understanding of a student's abilities and accomplishments by simply looking at the student's work, rather than the abstracted final grade. This, of course, is the primary idea behind portfolio assessment: students can compile their best work in writing, math, science, art, and even community service and present a more vivid record of what they are able to do. Portfolios are gaining currency as an assessment alternative to report cards and transcripts; numbers of schools, and even entire states -- notably Kentucky and Vermont -- are using portfolios to get a more accurate description of a student's capabilities.<p>        To a school interested in reform, the idea sounds terrific; that portfolios can provide a more detailed picture than test scores and letter grade transcripts is beyond question. Then reality strikes. What are we going to do with ALL THIS STUFF? In Kentucky -- where, as part of the Education Reform Act, portfolios are now in place in writing and math and will soon be in place for other disciplines -- there are stories of schools budgeting for a hundred filing cabinets. <p>        Even beyond the logistical nightmare of thousands of papers turning brittle and collecting dust, there are at least two other practical drawbacks. First, not everything may be on paper. A student's best demonstration of mathematical reasoning ability may be a three-dimensional model; a student's best articulation of historical under-standing may have come during a debate. Yes, we can use photographs and videotapes -- but  these give rise to even more issues of storage. Second, the mass of paper and other materials isn't easily managed for presentation in a filing cabinet. What if a research paper in history is the best example of writing a student completed? Do we make two copies of the paper and file one under "history" and one under "writing"? Do we keep a paper index or develop an elaborate system for cross-referencing? <p>        Further, how does this student's piece compare with those of students from other years? How can a younger student see a "benchmark" performance that meets the high standard that she is striving to achieve? Portfolios are typically filed by student -- last name first, etc. -- but what if we want to compare two or more students' writing samples? A paper chase ensues.<p>        The Exhibitions Project at the Coalition of Essential Schools, with support from the IBM Corporation, has been developing a way to address these problems. Using computer technology, we can create a richer picture of what a student can know and do. Our task is to create a tool to communicate that picture. This paper describes our prototype for a "digital" portfolio.2<p><hr><h2>A Tool for Planning Backwards</h2><hr>The Digital Portfolio is a computer-based tool for what the Exhibitions Project of the Coalition has termed "planning backwards."3 A school can approach decisions about its system of education by addressing a series of three questions:<p><ol>        <li><i>    What should a graduate of this school know and be able to do? </i>  The answer to this question is the "vision" of the qualities that a graduate -- any graduate -- should possess. The vision needs to be created by the school community, led by the faculty that will be looking for those qualities in their classrooms.<p>       <li><i>     How can a student demonstrate the skills and knowledge that a graduate should have?</i>   In other words, how would we know that a student has the qualities to fulfill our vision? Here, the answer might take the form of a set of "exhibitions" or other performance-based assessments completed either individually or collaboratively.<p>       <li><i>     How can the school arrange its systems so that all students can exhibit the desired skills and knowledge? </i>  This is where the real work of school change begins. The school needs to look at all its systems -- curriculum, pedagogy, assessment, schedul-ing, administration, and so on -- in an honest attempt to determine if the decisions it makes are helping students fulfill the vision. Often this takes a great deal of "rewiring" of communication within the school -- not just with physical wires, but by creating a structure of time and space that allows everyone involved with the school to communicate.</ol></ol><p>        The Digital Portfolio represents a tool that may help a school develop some preliminary answers to these questions.<p><hr><h2>A Walk Through the Digital Portfolio Prototype</h2><hr>The Digital Portfolio is a "hypermedia" document. This simply means that the portfolio is a set of screens (or pages, in the terminology of the software) that are linked by buttons on the screen. When the user clicks the mouse to select a button, the program reacts, typically by navigating to another screen or by showing some additional information. In this section, we will walk through the prototype. Keep in mind that this is a work in progress -- a demonstration to begin the conversation, rather than a completed product.<p>        The opening page of the Digital Portfolio is an identification of the student and her school.  In the bar along the bottom of the screen are several buttons; clicking on any of the words in that bar elicits an action. For example, clicking on the Photo button allows the user to see a digitized photo of the student. Clicking on the Information button shows a screen with additional information about the student, such as her years of enrollment and other administrative data. Clicking on the Instructions button brings up a screen that tells the user how to navigate through the portfolio. <p>        When the user clicks on the Main Menu button on the Introductory screen, the portfolio moves to the Main Menu screen. The design of the portfolio begins with an answer to the first question of planning backwards: What should a graduate know and be able to do? In our example, we have used the Kentucky Education Reform Act's six "learning goals," each of which comprises a number of outcomes. (The state has defined seventy-five outcomes under these six goals.) The six learning goals are listed on the left side of the screen. Again, these particular goals are simply an example; the set of goals used in any school's portfolio would be established by the local community.<p>        Our prototype contains an additional column of goals to the right of the six primary learning goals. The right-hand column represents the subgoals of Goal 2, Core Concepts. Goal 2 is divided into smaller sections, primarily because the design of the portfolio parallels in many ways how teachers organize paper portfolios. If a student filed all of his or her work in folders representing the six learning goals, the folder for the Core Concepts would be bursting at the seams. Thus, our Main Menu provides folders for what Kentucky has defined as the six "core concept areas" of learning: science, mathematics, social sciences, arts and humanities, living skills, vocational studies. <p>        The names of the goals -- Communication, Self-Sufficiency, and so on -- require some elaboration. Clicking on the round button next to a goal (or subgoal under Core Concepts) brings up a window showing the outcomes associated with that goal. In our example, the detailed description consists of the outcomes defined for each learning goal by the state. There is a list of outcomes associated with the goal of Communication. We can scroll down the list to see the rest of the outcomes.<p>        We imagine that when a student enters a school, he or she will be given a blank portfolio, containing only screens. The student can browse through the goals and see what it is that he or she is expected to be able to know and do before graduating. One might also expect that incoming students will want to see benchmark performances in goal areas from earlier graduates' folders. <p>        Next, we need to ask the second planning backwards question: How can a student demonstrate those skills and knowledge that a graduate should have? The Coalition refers to such demon-strations as "exhibitions," and they can take many forms: seminars, research projects, oral and written presentations, and yes, even timed tests. <p>        An exhibition is an assessment that provides the opportunity for students to demonstrate a skill or knowledge that is highly valued by the school. It grows from a vision of students performing as their teachers hoped they would. As Joe McDonald has written, an exhibition "faces inward, points out-ward, and presses deeper."4 It allows a school to see what its students have done and to show the community what the school itself is doing, and it provides grist for the conversation mill within the school and community about standards and systems. So the Digital Portfolio, with exhibitions as its core content, presents not only the student but also the values and contours of the school community.<p>        While any kind of information could go into the Digital Portfolio -- including the familiar transcript, report cards, and standardized test scores -- its strength is its ability to present authentic performance, such as exhibitions, in any media.<p> <hr><h3>Looking Into a Folder</h3><hr>                Let's consider some specific examples. How will we know if a student has demonstrated the ability to communicate or to solve problems? If we click on the folder icon next to a goal, we see a list of performances representing the student's exhibitions of that goal. <p>         This list of performances is essentially a "table of contents" for a goal. It is meant to represent the student's performances over a period of time. The list might include performances required by the school or the state, such as the entries for the twelfth-grade writing portfolio, or it might include performances that the student feels are good representations of her work. <p>         Any single performance might be a representation of more than one outcome or goal. In this example, the Waterfront exhibition is listed in both the Communications and Problem Solving folders. Because the portfolio is a hypermedia  document, multiple paths can lead to the same information -- that is, a user can get to the same point in more than one way. One advantage of the technological version of a portfolio is that we only need to retain one copy of the actual student work on the disk, no matter how many places it is filed.<p>         From this table of contents, a user can click on any of the titles to see the work. Let's suppose the user clicked on the Waterfront exhibition. <p>         On the left side of this screen is the actual student work; by scrolling through that window, the user can read the entire work as it was submitted by the student (or, as in this case, a group of students). Here we see a description of how this student group proposes to bring more people to the Louisville waterfront.<p>         The box on the right side of the screen displays additional information about the current portfolio item. The "demonstrated goals" -- meaning the outcomes that a reader should find in this piece -- are taken from the list of outcomes we saw in the Main Menu. This exhibition demonstrates a number of goals including "productive team membership" and "critical thinking skills."5 It is not, however, listed as a demonstration of "visual arts," though there is a visual component to the work; presumably, some other piece of work in the portfolio is a better demonstration of that outcome. This kind of selection and annotation can be made by the student, building in a reflective dimension to her school career. <p>         One advantage of the digital portfolio is its ability to store multiple media. Graphics, for example, are incorporated into this student's work. Below the text are three buttons, labeled Video, Audio, and Graphic. Clicking on the Graphic button displays a list of graphics that the student has created for her presentation. Our example shows a sketch done by the student that was included with the project. In this case, the sketch was drawn by hand and scanned into the portfolio; drawings created by computer paint, drawing, and animation programs can be included in the portfolio as well.<p>         Returning to the Goals screen, the menu along the bottom of the screen allows us to look at other aspects of the exhibition. Clicking on the Assignment button brings up another screen.<p>         Again, on the left is the student work. On the right of this screen is the project description, the assignment that the student received from the teacher. Having a view of the assignment helps to put the performance in context; if one understands the constraints of the assignment, one is better able to judge the student work.<p>         The menu bar now contains a Goals button. It also contains a button labeled Evaluation. If we click on the Evaluation button, we see a new screen.<p>         The right side of the screen now contains a list of evaluators. If we click on any of the evaluators in this list, we will see an evaluation of the student work. Presumably, there will be a teacher evaluation for all items in a portfolio. The prototype allows for the student and other judges to evaluate the work as well. In fact, any reader may add an evaluation "on the fly" by clicking on the top line of the evaluators list and entering comments in a text box. <p>         In our example, we can see the rubric used by the teacher in evaluating the project. If we scroll down the list, we can see what an "A" project represents, what a "B" project represents, and so on. The outside evaluators for this exhibition were representatives from the city's office of planning and development, whose evaluation of the exhibition offers other insights to the student work.<p> <hr><h3>Design Issues</h3><hr>The Digital Portfolio prototype, as it exists now, contains information for just one student. As such, it contains useful information about a student's abilities and can provide a demonstration of growth over time. Imagine, for example, storing a recorded oral presentation in each of the four years of a student's high school career. This longitudinal dimension, so valued by teachers, is woefully underserved by the documentation we currently maintain on students.<p>         It can also place student work in a context. Rather than simply identifying papers and projects as "best work," it identifies that a particular piece of work is a "best" demonstration of a particular outcome. Still, further elements need to go into the design. We assume that some users -- for instance, college admissions officers -- may want to see more than one student's work at a time. We need to design a multimedia database that allows easy searches through multiple portfolios, and that can answer queries such as, "Show me outstanding performances in writing portfolios" or "Show me all the science folders for my incoming chemistry class." Students can also see what valued outcomes they need to fulfill before they graduate and benchmark performances by recent graduates.<p>         A database does not imply, though, that all student information should be available for all to view. Students should be seen as the owners of their own work. While a school should be able to retain a copy of some work as evidence of a student's performance, and may physically store the student work, the student should have at least some degree of control of what is included in the portfolio. For example, the school might legiti-mately require a writing sample; the particular sample that is submitted should be chosen by the student.<p>         We need to answer the question, "What information is useful?" The answer, we presume, would be different for different audiences. We might presume that a student would want to keep everything that he or she produced in one version of the portfolio, and that the school would maintain a subset of that material as the "transcript." The school and the student might reduce that information even further for other audiences (e.g., college admissions officers, employers, accreditation agencies), combining selected exhibitions with more traditional information (test scores, grades, records of participation in clubs, sports, and so on). <p> <hr><h3>Technical Considerations</h3><hr>        There are also technical hurdles to be overcome. Multimedia documents -- particularly video clips -- occupy a great deal of disk space. (One earlier prototype, with about four minutes total of non-compressed video, occupies about twenty mega-bytes on a hard disk.) With hundreds or thousands of students developing portfolios within a school, issues of storing bits of information are just as real as issues of storing paper copies of everything. Still, compression technologies (such as Intel's Digital Video Interactive) and read-write optical storage media (for example, a "writable" CD-ROM) are making such storage more viable.<p>         In addition, we would want to communicate this information across distances -- some distances as short as between classrooms, some as long as from a school to a state education department. Networked multi-media is still in its early stages; transmitting large amounts of data across wires is not as fast or as efficient as it needs to be. Again, though, much work is being done in this area, from advanced forms of local-area networking to the development of the "information superhighway." <p>         Because multimedia storage and networking are issues that touch most every application of computing, the computer scientists and engineers of academia and industry are committing great resources to creating reasonable solutions to these problems. The solutions are some time away, but we can anticipate the initial technological solutions fairly quickly -- in less time, perhaps, than it will take for the educational establishment to embrace alternative assessments across the board. To that end, the digital portfolio represents a vision of what is possible.<p> <hr><h2>Using the Portfolio in School</h2><hr>        Let's assume then that we have all of the technical kinks worked out, and that the design of the portfolio and database have been established. Now, how would a school use this tool? In essence, we are now asking the third of our planning backwards questions: <i>How do we arrange our systems so that students will be able to exhibit the desired skills and knowledge? </i>We present here conjectures, some based on the work being done by schools that are pilot testing the Digital Portfolio (Eastern High School in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and Thayer High School in Winchester, New Hampshire), and some based on our theoretical musings.<p>         A school's first step would be to determine what it wants its students to know and be able to do. This means that the labels on the folders in the Main Menu would vary from school to school and from state to state. Most schools have some kind of listing of goals and outcomes, but often those are collecting dust in a filing cabinet.6 By providing every student and every teacher with a copy of those goals, and a reason to know them, the goals have a better chance of driving instruction and learning in the school. <p>         Then the exhibitions need to be established. That is, teachers and students need to determine what will be in the "table of contents" for each folder. Many Essential schools involved in planning backwards are establishing their own goals and exhibitions. Even within more structured frameworks, such as Kentucky's, there is much room for improvisation and experimentation.<p> <a name = "eastern"><hr><h3>Eastern: Using "Student Power"</h3><hr>                A next step is to tie classroom activities to the portfolio-bound work. At Eastern High School, during the 1993-94 school year, members of the senior class are putting together digital portfolios. (The hope is that what this class does this year can be applied to the school as a whole in the next year.) The students will certainly be including those pieces that are part of the required state portfolio for twelfth-graders in writing. In addition, students will select pieces from other classes.<p>         When a student enters an item into the portfolio, he or she needs to know what outcomes are being demonstrated. The faculty has discussed developing a system where students can seek the counsel of a "portfolio advisor" on the faculty to determine which outcomes have been met by that work. Ideally, teachers will be able to tell students which outcomes are being addressed before the students begin their work; the goals of the school need to permeate and shape its activities.<p>         Logistically, students and faculty need access to equipment; however, we do not assume that every student and every teacher needs his or her own machine. The approach at Eastern takes advan-tage of an important technical resource: student power. Two groups of students are involved. First, the seniors who are creating their portfolios are responsible for getting their work into digital form. When possible, they will word-process or otherwise use computers to generate their work in the first place. However, they also have access to the school's scanners to input work that they have not previously digitized. The school also has a video camera and audio recording devices, which will be used by the students to record performances or to annotate their work. The students who are putting portfolios together are responsible for making sure a video camera is in the room when a performance is being given or for recording significant elements in the process of a project.<p>         Second, a group of about twenty students is providing support for the first group. This second group is taking a class in multimedia, learning the intricacies of hypermedia systems such as Toolbook. The teacher, Scott Horan, makes an analogy between this production staff and the school newspaper staff. Just as some students write articles and other students lay out the paper, the seniors will put their work into digital form (and determine in which folder the work will reside), and the portfolio production team will provide the technical support to place the work in the digital portfolio. The construction of the digital portfolios in schools can itself become an "episode of learning."7<p>         The school has arranged systems so that students can provide maximum support for each other. Mr. Horan's class takes place during the lunch period, allowing the portfolio production team to find and assist other students as the need arises.<p>         The faculty, of course, plays a key role in helping to make the portfolios happen. Portfolio advisors for groups of students can help to map the student work to the outcomes and help the students determine what is "best" work. The implication, of course, is that the faculty needs to be consistent in determining what is "good enough" to go into the portfolio and which pieces show mastery of the corresponding goals. Eastern also has the benefit of a local-area network established for teachers, which allows for sharing of electronic mail and other information. More importantly, it has developed a culture where teachers will talk with each other about student work and about standards of achievement. <p> <a name = "thayer"><hr><h3>Thayer: Using Portfolios to Enhance Change</h3><hr>                The development at Thayer has been somewhat different. There, the portfolio protocol has been articulated for the entire school; Thayer has a list of nineteen graduation skills in place of Kentucky's seventy-five outcomes. <p>         Thayer is a much smaller school than Eastern, and the school is already designed to get to know students well. Almost all the teachers belong to teams that work with one group of students in all of their subject areas.8<p>         Computer support is provided by a teacher, Rick Durkee, and the area computing coordinator, Tom Warner. While there is no organized class, student power is still in evidence at the school; the kids know who among them has an interest in com-puters, and they seek help when necessary.<p>         At Thayer, the development of digital portfolios represents an addition of technology to an existing structure. Since teachers already have advisories where they talk with students about their work and a portfolio system that allows students to collect their work, the process of adding the Digital Portfolio is "merely" the process of employing the technology within an existing structure.<p>         This strategy works at Thayer, we believe, because the school has already changed its structure from many of the traditional norms. It is highly probable that the Digital Portfolio would be an overwhelming burden for a school that had not changed its systems of assessment and its use of time. The Digital Portfolio makes assessment much more public and thus focuses conversations in the school on the issues of standards and student achievement. A teacher cannot simply close the classroom door when the assignments and evaluations she provides will be as much a part of the student record as the student work itself. <p>         In fact, we would propose the following hypothesis: the most important thing in the adoption and adaptation of a new technological tool is the culture of the school. A school that is willing to change will find the possibilities in the new tool; a school that is reluctant to change will find the burdens. Further work with Digital Portfolios will provide many tests of this hypothesis.<p> <hr><h3>Future Issues</h3><hr>        The experiments at Eastern and Thayer will help define some of the issues of implementing the Digital Portfolio, including the time and space requirements needed to put them together, and the technological requirements for maintaining them. Once we have begun to collect some actual student work, we can begin to address the next set of questions. How would outside audiences -- parents, colleges, businesses, states, and so on -- use these portfolios? What additional features are neces-sary? How would those within the school use the portfolios? How would a school handle issues of confidentiality and access to student information? We plan to have conversations during the coming year with these audiences -- conversations built around actual student work as represented in the digital portfolios.<p>         We can imagine many possibilities for the use of digital portfolios, but as often happens with technology, imagination runs far ahead of reality. Our primary goal, however, is not techno-logical; rather it is to devise a tool that can help schools develop a richer picture of what students are capable of doing.<p> <hr><h2>Footnotes</h2><hr><ol><li> Grant Wiggins, panelist for "Performance Assessment: Exploring the Role of Performance Criteria and Standards," Education Commission of the States/Colorado Department of Education Con-ference on Alternative Assessment, Breckenridge, CO, June 1991.<p><li> The concept for the Digital Portfolio was developed by David Niguidula.

<html><head><title>CES: Publications: Horace: 10-5: College Admissions and the Essential School</title></head><body><hr><h1><center> College Admissions and the Essential School</center></h1><hr><center>Volume 10, Number 5   <br>March 1994</center><hr>Get any group of college professors talking about what kindof first-year students they long for, and the discussion sounds likeanadvertisement for Essential School habits of mind. Give usstudents whocan think through complex issues, they say, who read andwrite acrossthe disciplines, initiate projects, work independently.Faced withentering students who increasingly need remedial work,universityfaculties often wring their hands and blame the schools.<p>   But ask any Essential school person to name the biggestobstacle toreshaping curriculum and assessment practices at thesecondary level,and the answer inevitably turns to college admissions.Integratedcoursework in long blocks? Alternative assessments likeexhibitions,projects, and portfolios? Heterogeneous grouping? Thoughthesestrategies may aim to develop the very intellectual habitscolleges areasking for, they run into determined resistance fromteachers, parents,and students who believe that getting into college dependson meeting astrict set of course requirements, accumulating a certaingrade pointaverage, rising to a certain rank in the class, and doingwell onstandardized measures like SAT and ACT tests.<p>   Just how much difference does this issue actually makefor studentswhose schools have moved most boldly along new paths? How dothey farewith the most selective colleges if their course transcriptsandevaluations look different, their schools refuse to rankthem in class,their courses don't carry prestigious Advanced Placementcredit? In thesea of applications received by large state universities, dothose lesseasily quantified sink, or rise to the top? Conversationswith a dozenadmissions officers and school people reveal surprisingdifferencesbetween the perception and the reality of this highlycharged issue.<p>   "Worrying about colleges may be important but it shouldnot stand inthe way of schools interested in change," says Sharon LloydClark,director of Brown University's Institute for SecondaryEducation andhead of the Coalition of Essential Schools' AdmissionsProject. "Whenyou actually get high school people to sit down with collegepeople andtalk about teaching and learning, they're concerned aboutthe sameproblems. Admissions can and should be a support andcatalyst forchange, not a barrier." At a recent meeting held at HarvardUniversity,Clark says, admissions officers expressed disappointment atthe lack ofinnovation by some of the. top-flight suburban high schoolsattending."The University of Chicago's director of admissions, TedO'Neill, toldthe schools, 'Do whatever you find educationally and morallysound-we'lldeal with it!"'<p>   The demographics of today's high school students and thewide supplyof their available choices, in any case, have virtuallyinsured that anypaying student can attend some college these days. Thescramble comes asthey compete for places at the mere 75 schools that acceptfewer thanhalf of their applicants.<i>Peterson's Competitive Colleges 1993-94</i> labelsas "selective" some 275 other post-secondary institutions,from privatecolleges to public universities, but those places (and 3,200others) arein competition for a short supply of 18-year-olds. Manycolleges stayfinancially viable only by recruiting adult students.<p>   Ever since the presidents of ten of the most demanding ofthoseinstitutions met in 1892 to determine what satisfied them ina highschool graduate, the secondary curriculum of United Statesschools hasflowed from their desires. The "Committee of Ten" called forspecificcourses, often in a sequence that owed no more to logic thanto thealphabet ("biology, chemistry, physics," for example). Inthe 1920s, theCarnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching requiredthatcollege admissions offices measure those courses in year-length"Carnegie units" of instruction time, as a condition for thecolleges'joining the foundation's pension system (now called TIAA-CREF).<p>   In that agricultural and industrial age, when fewstudents needed togo past grammar school to qualify for a job, the secondarycurriculumapplied chiefly to a small college-bound elite. A centurylater, a legionof future "knowledge workers" and "symbolic analysts" of theinformationage are still laboring under the same high-schoolsequence-rarelypracticing the skills of synthesis and solution that willface them incollege and on the job, but dutifully accumulating thecourse units thatpromise to get them into college.<p>   Ironically, the elite selective colleges have stoppedcaring as muchabout all that as everybody thinks. "We can be veryadaptable," saysPamela Roth Appleton, an admissions officer at WellesleyCollege, whichselected its 1998 class of around 600 from around 3,400applicants thisyear. "Every folder is read completely, in committeefashion. We havestudents who were home schooled-we don't even require a highschooldiploma, although we do ask for SAT scores."<p><hr><h2>What's the Difference?</h2><hr>Though Wellesley says its most successful students comeprepared withfour years of English, social sciences, mathematics, and labscience, ithas a long history of supporting high schools that breakfrom theconventional mold. In the 1930s, it was one of 40 leadingcolleges thatagreed to admit students from 30 progressive high schoolsdespite anuntraditional preparation-and to track their progressthrough theircollege years. The Eight-Year Study, as it was called,showed that byall standards -the colleges', the students' peers, and thestudentsthemselves- students from the experimental schools did asomewhat betterjob than their counterparts; and the more radically theschool hadrestructured its curriculum, the better they did. Onconventional tests theexperimental group did as well as their peers fromtraditional schools; but theyout-performed their counterparts on measures of problem-solving skills,creativity, and the like. And they were more likely to beleaders on campus.<p>   Other traditional selecting factors prove equally emptywhen studentsare followed through their college years, research shows. Astudyconducted for the American College Testing (ACT) Programshowed thatneither test scores, high school grades, nor even collegegradescorrelated with later accomplishments as early as two yearsaftercollege. The only predictive factor emerged as high schoolextracurricular activities-interesting evidence for thosewho argue thatstudents learn most through performance-based activitiesthey initiatethemselves.<p>   More four-year colleges than ever now choose, on thebasis of studieslike this, to make submitting standardized test scoresoptional. Aforthcoming study by the FairTest center in Cambridge,Massachusetts,shows that 188 colleges (including Bowdoin, Bates, Wheaton,theUniversity of Oregon, and California State University) takethisapproach. "We know none that has ever gone back to a test-score drivenadmissions process," says FairTest spokesman Bob Schaeffer."They allfind they get more diverse students -by race, gender,geographicaldistribution, income, and intellectual skills." A five-yearstudy byBates College, which made SATs optional in 1984, found that"whilesubmitters of SATs did just about what one would predictfrom theirSATs, nonsubmitters consistently did much better, about two-tenths of agrade point above their predicted GPA," wrote Bates dean ofadmissionsWilliam Hiss in <i>The Journal of College Admission.</i> "Thestudents seemedto be right when they told us, 'I am simply a better studentthan thesetests would suggest."'<p>   In anecdotal form, these results are duplicated as thefirst Essentialschools watch their graduates' progress through college."Every year SyracuseUniversity accepts about eight of our students," saysadmissions counselor andteacher Shirley Hawkinson at Central Park East SecondarySchool in New YorkCity, which sends virtually all of its graduates on tocollege and followstheir progress there. "The first batch are doing so verywell there thatadmissions people come back every year to interview andrecruit here."CPESS students stand out, Syracuse tells Hawkinson, "becausethey knowhow to ask questions--they're never shy about using thehabits of mind."She has heard the same thing from Wesleyan, Hampshire, andBardColleges, where CPESS students perform "remarkably well."<p><hr><h2>Dealing with Numbers</h2><hr>While smaller colleges and universities can provideindividual attentionto every applicant, large campuses that may enroll up to10,000 studentsin an entering class face a stickier problem. To manage theselectionprocess efficiently, they devise numerical formulas usingthestandardized admission criteria-a core of required courses,grade pointaverage, rank in class, and SAT or ACT scores. Using"objective"criteria, they argue, protects them against charges of biasand providesaccountability to constituencies both public and private.<p>   At the same time, realizing that too many high schoolgraduates wereill prepared for college work, at least 20 stateuniversities havetightened and raised their admission requirements since1986. But fewmoved to align their standards with the growing movementamong statelegislatures and policymakers toward reforms at the schoollevel such asperformance-based competency requirements. Schools werecaught in a tugof war between competing demands for old- and new-styleimprovement.A few state systems recognized this dilemma and acted toresolve it:<p><ul><li>On the advice of university and school people and thestate educationdepartment, the University of Wisconsin recently decided topilot acompetency-based admissions policy as a supplement to itsstandardentrance policy. <li>Nebraska has pledged to define new ways students fromoutcomes-basedschools could meet the core entrance requirements for thestateuniversity system.<li>Applicants to Wyoming's state university system must havecompletedeither a specified number of course units in varioussubjects "or theirequivalents in competency-based outcomes."<li>Oregon may soon link its statewide emphasis on K-12portfolioassessment to state university admission policies byarranging forportfolio review procedures instead of Carnegie-unitrequirements.<li>Tennessee's state university and community college systemhasdeveloped an assessment and placement program that providesinformationabout high school students' skills so as to appropriatelyplace them inpost-secondary institutions.<li>In response to New York's New Compact for Learning, aState Universityof New York (SUNY) task force has specified the skills andknowledge itsentrants need to succeed in their first year and endorsedperformance-based assessments to guide both admissions and placementdecisions. <li>In California, the Transitions project of the state schoolrestructuring office is working with the state universitysystem toaccommodate integrated courses and alternative assessmentsin thestate's requirements for university admissions.</ul><p>   What characterizes these projects is a new sense ofcollaborationbetween universities and school renewal efforts at the K-12level.There's something in it for each of them; better-preparedentrants wouldcut down on post-secondary remedial courses, and eliminateredundanciesbetween high school and college courses. And if collegescould clearlyconvey to high school students what skills and knowledgewill equip themfor progress toward their later goals, schools couldorganize theircurricula in ways that would reflect real meaning, not merecreditaccumulation.<p>   "Why can't kids check in with the university by computerfrom ninthgrade on, to record and analyze their growing skills andcompetencies inrelation to what their hopes are?" says educationalconsultant GlennSingleton, a former admissions officer at the University ofPennsylvaniawho now heads California's Transitions project.<p>   One Essential school has proposed to its state educationdepartment andits university regents that the state run a pilot programusingperformance assessments as the basis for both high schoolgraduation anduniversity admissions. Under the proposal, a half dozen highschoolswould move to competency- and performance-based graduationassessments.With those diplomas, students would be admitted to thestate'suniversity system. A longitudinal study would track studentsthrough thesix years following high school graduation, providing usefuldata aboutwhether performance assessments can reliably predict collegesuccess.<p><hr><h2>Comparing Student Work</h2><hr>The answer will interest admissions officers at any largeinstitution,who must reduce school judgments to numbers they can fairlycompare. Atypical dilemma shows up in the University of Californiasystem, whichby law considers only the top 12.5 percent of the state'sstudents, andwhich in fact can accommodate only 7 percent on its hard-pressedcampuses. Its rigid formula for admission includes adherenceto the "A-Frequirements," an array of approved "academically rigorous"courses thatfall under six content areas. For a school to deviate fromthat recipewith, say, an integrated math and science offering, it mustsubmit eachcourse syllabus for state approval. As a result, manyprogressiveschools contend, the A-F requirements exert a strangleholdon curriculumfor all students and encourage a strictly tracked system.<p>   "It's extremely frustrating," says Joel Kammer, whoteaches atCoalition member Piner High School in Santa Rosa,California. "Even withfewer than ten percent of our students going on to UCcampuses, what UCchooses to recognize and exclude has total control. We'vegot to runthis stuff through them in order to make any changes.''Kammer wants tosee integrated courses listed alongside A-F courses in thestandard UCadmission student profile, not treated as special cases orexemptions.<p>   Many Essential schools choose to avoid the issue bysimply recordingunusual or integrated studies in traditional separate coursecategorieson transcripts. Similarly, they may use old-fashioned lettergrades toindicate student mastery, rather than developing newdesignations (like"satisfactory" or "distinguished") that refer to variousproficiencylevels. What grades and course titles represent, after all,has alwaysvaried from school to school, and admissions officersrecognize andoften compensate for this.<p>   "It only takes schools an extra step or two to convertqualityperformance assessments to the kind of numbers colleges feelcomfortablewith," says Rick Lear, principal of Arizona's new Sedona RedRock HighSchool. "Most state admissions officers are candid aboutwantingnumbers; they'll take a narrative evaluation and assign it anumber."<p>   A better solution, Singleton asserts, lies in developinga mutualunderstanding between schools and universities as to thegoals of each,and a mutual trust that they are speaking the same languagewhen theyevaluate students. "The key is co-design and also co-assessment," he says. "Wewant the university to know Piner well enough that itaccepts the school'sassessments as truthful and accountable to both thestudents' and theuniversity's needs." Such a dialogue could create, hesuggests, "a seamless web,where the exit outcomes of high schools match precisely theentrancerequirements of the university."<p>   Some educators worry that student assessment is thusdefinedprimarily as a high-stakes function that determinesstudents' futures,not a way to affect and enrich teaching and learning in thepresent."I'm willing to describe, not to sort and select," saysMichael Patron,who heads the Crefeld School, a small private Coalitionmember school inPhiladelphia. "If colleges will define exactly whatqualities they'relooking for, I'll be as specific as they want about actualskills andpersonal qualities." Crefeld's transcripts show no classrank; itsgrades show growth, effort, and ability, not comparison withotherstudents; it will not accumulate credit units, weight honorscourses, orcalculate grade point averages. On its two-page transcriptappear notonly course topics and grades but also a breakdown of howwell students havemastered essential skills.  Extensivewritten comments get sentto the college as recommendations or in the form of "mostrecent report card."<p><hr><h2>Presenting Student Work</h2><hr>"We've never had a school reject what we do," Patron says."They find itinteresting, and they'll call to talk it over." Such one-to-oneconversations do help colleges translate unusual records,admissionspeople note; they also appreciate succinct andunderstandabletranscripts.<p>   Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, whichsubstituteswritten evaluations for letter grades, has developed aconcise narrativetranscript for graduate school admissions purposes. "Weevaluate thestudent's cumulative portfolio, summarizing and synthesizingin two tothree typewritten pages the students' work, including a listof coursesand related learning activities," says professor MerleBruno.<p>   Early and frequent communication between schools andcolleges,stresses Brown's Sharon Lloyd Clark, goes farther than anyother factorin smoothing a student's path toward college admission.Heathwood Hall,a South Carolina private Essential School, routinely invites200 collegeadmissions people from far and wide to attend its graduationexhibitions. "Our job is to let them know our uniquequalities in everyway we can," says upper school principal Lark Palma. "Alongwith ourtranscript we send a school profile explaining ourexhibitions andportfolios and describing what we consider distinguished andhonorswork; we also list the colleges that have accepted them inrecentyears."<p>   "When admissions people visit your school, make sure theyunderstandjust how you're changing and why," advises Clark. "Take themintoclassrooms; let them see kids working in new ways." Ifteachers areworking more closely with fewer students, she says, pointthat out;their recommendations will hold more insight and carry moreweight.<p>   "It's a two-way street," Clark says. "We have this ideathat you canonly say the most glowing things in recommendations. But thebestcollege placements are good matches, and an honestevaluation of astudent's strengths and weaknesses can help make thatmatch."<p>   Partnerships with area colleges can go a long way towardestablishingtrust on their part that Essential schools are providing ademandingacademic preparation. "If university people routinelywitness studentwork and provide critical feedback, the school is developinglong-termcredibility," Clark says. "Involve them in setting highstandards."<p>   Untangling the business of college admissions opens theway for anunprecedented national discourse on K-16 reform. If theywill moveboldly to align their practices with the substance of whatcolleges arelooking for, Essential schools could well lead the way. <p><hr>       <h2>What Competency-Based Admission CanAchieve</h2><hr><ul><li>A good competency-based admission policy should encourageinnovationat the secondary school level. It would allow a student todemonstrateknowledge of the required subject matter without completinga discretecourse that would translate into a Carnegie unit.<p><li>A good competency-based admission policy should make itpossible for astudent to be admitted to college by taking either collegepreparatoryor "tech prep" classes. If a school district can documentthat studentswho have taken "applied" math or science courses, forinstance, can meetuniversity-defined competency standards, those studentswould meetadmissions requirements.<p><li>A good competency-based admission policy should be basedon attainmentof the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in college,not on thecompletion of a discrete course.<p><li>A good competency-based admission policy should leaveresponsibilityfor presentation of the students' case for college readinesswith thesecondary schools. Once the university has set admissionsstandards interms of competencies and specified general requirements forpresentingstudent records, secondary schools would develop valid andreliableassessment techniques and present them in a "user-friendly"format.<p></ul>     <i>(Excerpted and condensed from the report of theUniversity ofWisconsin Task Force on Competency-Based Admission - June1993)</i><p><hr>            <h2>What Harvard Wants: Habits of Mind</h2><hr>What do the most selective colleges believe incomingstudents shouldknow and be able to do so as to make the most of their post-secondarylearning opportunities? A Harvard University booklet,"Choosing Coursesto Prepare for College," draws largely from a study of howHarvardstudents' high-school preparation affected performance inthe college'sCore program of study. For Essential Schools, severalrecommendationsstand out particularly.<p><ul><li>Though the booklet lists areas of study primarily bydiscipline(English literature, foreign language, history, mathematics,andscience), it emphasizes "important knowledge, skills, orhabits ofthought, rather than naming specific courses." Research andwritingstands as a separate category equal in importance to anysubject area.The principal message: Depth matters more than coverage,since highschool programs vary. Use your school's strongest teachersand resourcesto take the most demanding courses you can find.<p><li>In English literature, Harvard emphasizes critical andanalyticalreading. Make reading as deep as possible in a particulararea, thecollege says, rather than superficially covering unrelatedreadings."Besides reading novels for what they can tell you aboutlife in [other]times and places," the booklet reads, "you will notice howauthors treatdifferent problems or how they treat the same problems indifferentways." (Essential questions, anyone?)<p><li>In foreign languages, Harvard advises studying one foreignlanguageand its literature in depth rather than a smattering ofseverallanguages.<p><li>In history Harvard urges students to take much more thantheirrequired American history course, arguing that the rigorousstudy ofhistory provides a more basic preparation for college workthan othersocial sciences courses. By taking additional courses thatfocus on timeperiods or other areas, the college says, students learn tounderstand"the assumptions underlying our political, social, andeconomicinstitutions." Studying ideas and institutions in ahistorical context,it writes, teaches students "to think about these mattersanalytically;to understand not only what happened but how and why."<p><li>Four years of high school mathematics alone won't do thetrick,Harvard says; students need to "acquire the habit ofpuzzling overmathematical relationships." Don't just memorize formulasanddefinitions but question and understand them, Harvard urges,askingstudents to solve hard problems containing applications."The ability towrestle with difficult problems is far more important thanthe knowledgeof many formulae or relationships," the booklet says. "It isnot whatcourses you have taken, but how much you have thought aboutmathematics,that counts. More important than the knowledge of a specificmathematical topic is the willingness to tackle newproblems."<p><li>"The study of science begins with the habit of askingquestions,"Harvard advises, asking students to study the basic sciencesofchemistry, physics, and biology for four years if possible.The bookleturges practice in the scientific processes of performingexperiments,making measurements, and developing theories to explain andpredictphenomena.<p><li>Research and writing about texts is key to preparing forcollege,Harvard says: "If you read with curiosity and purpose, youwill be ableto take notes more easily, to weigh one author's viewagainst another,to categorize your research under leading questions, and toform yourown observations and opinions." Write regularly incoursework andjournals "to find out what you think," it says, askingstudents also toreflect critically on their own writing.<p></ul>Following its advice will not ensure admission, the bookletadmonishes.Harvard selects students not only by their academicpreparation, itsays, but by many other criteria. "Most of all we look forstudents whomake the most of their opportunities and the resourcesavailable tothem, and who are likely to continue to do so throughouttheir lives,"the authors conclude.<p><hr><h2>A Crefeld School Transcript</h2><hr>This is the second page of a student's transcript from theCrefeldSchool, a small Coalition member school in Philadelphiaserving grades 7through 12.

TheCoreCurriculum includes Humanities (social studies, literature,languagearts, and fine arts) and Math/Science (mathematics,chemistry, physics,and biology). In addition, all students are required toparticipate inphysical education, community service, and two electiveseach semester.Only courses designated "elective" permit student choice.Humanities andMath/Science each meet 7 hours/week. Electives and PhysicalEd. eachmeet 2.5 hours/week. All students are required to perform 2hours ofcommunity service/week. Students graduate when they havecompleted a 3semester residency, satisfied all curriculum requirements,passed all 5senior exams with a grade of 90% and completed a portfolioof 6exhibitions of mastery.<p><hr>       <h2> Pennsylvania Colleges Ask for 'Habits ofMind'</h2><hr>We are as concerned with how students learn as with whatthey learn.What we learn - knowledge of facts, processes, and concepts- iscritical to success in college. How we learn is equallycritical. Weattach the highest value to the cultivation of such habitsof mind ascuriosity; independence, clarity, and incisiveness ofthought; tolerancefor ambiguity; and an ability to solve problems, coupledwith awillingness to work hard and an ability to manage time.Students will bepoorly prepared for college-level learning if their successin secondaryschool is largely a result of memorization.<p>   To help students develop and strengthen these habits andabilities,courses in secondary school need to be challenging andintellectuallydemanding. Because we believe that effective writingpromotes clearthinking, we expect courses to include frequent writingassignments.Clear, persuasive writing is grounded in the mastery of suchskills asanalytic thinking, problem solving, the interpretation oftexts,informed speculation, and the ability to communicateinformation andideas to others. Teachers should assign work which requiresstudents toassess and integrate what they have learned, therebydeveloping theirability to read and think critically. Those courses andassignmentschallenging enough to require students to manage their timewill helpprepare students for similar demands in college. Seriousindependentprojects reward students' curiosity and allow them todemonstrate theirknowledge by defining issues carefully and presenting theirown analysesand conclusions. Collaborative assignments develop students'ability tothink and learn from others as well as on their own. Whenstudentsquestion, interpret, and respond to ideas in conversationwith othersand draw conclusions through group discussion as well assolitaryspeculation, they are better prepared for the complexvariety of tasksthat they will face in college.<p>  <i>   (From "What We Expect: A Statement on Preparing forCollege," bythe Academic Deans of the (Pennsylvania) CommonwealthPartnership:Allegheny College, Bryn Mawr College, Bucknell University,CarnegieMellon University, Chatham College, Dickinson College,Franklin MarshallCollege, Gettysburg College, Haverford College, LafayetteCollege,Lehigh University, and Swarthmore College.)</i><p><hr><h2>Defining Readiness for College: SUNY'sExpectations</h2><hr>A State University of New York (SUNY) task force recommendsthat,beginning as early as ninth or tenth grade, students "engagein acontinuous authentic assessment experience that ismaintained throughouttheir high school years; and create an assessment product[portfolios,narrative teacher assessments, self-evaluations, checklistsofproficiencies, etc.] that could be taken with them tocollege and usedthere for academic planning and advisement." (Singlestandardized testscores, the group notes, "cannot capture the range ofknowledge andskills necessary for success in the freshman year.") Thoughit outlinesthe skills and areas of knowledge students need to succeedat SUNY, itemphasizes they are "reference points," not admissionsstandards, usefulin the dialogue with secondary schools about reform andintended to"change students' behaviors and enrich their learning." Itdefined thoseentry-level requirements broadly as follows:<p><h3>Entry-Level Skills</h3><ul><li><i>academic and personal support skills</i>, such asunderstanding learningstyles; planning, organizing, and setting priorities; usingeducationalResources and services; and accepting failure and successand learningfrom both.<li><i>information management skills</i>, such as familiarity withlibraryorganization, knowledge of the categories into whichinformation falls;ability to discriminate among sources of information, andcomputerliteracy.<li><i>communication skills:</i> reading; writing; listening andtaking notes;speaking.<li><i>analytical skills:</i> intellectual activities; problemsolving.</ul><p><h3>Entry-Level Knowledge</h3><li><i>humanities, arts, and foreign languages:</i> Language arts;visual andperforming arts; foreign languages and cultures<li><i>natural science, mathematics, and technical studies: </i>basicdimensionsof scientific, mathematical, and technologicalunderstanding; culturaland personal awareness of disciplines; crucial knowledgeareas; thecontext of science; mathematical literacy.<li><i>social sciences and history:</i> interrelationships; globalissues; majorissues of social science study of the U.S.; social sciencemethods;history methods.</ul><p>     <i>(SUNY Task Force Report on College Entry-LevelKnowledge andSkills)</i><p><hr><h2>Giving Essential Schools the Seal ofApproval</h2><hr>Through the efforts of the Coalition's Admissions Project,thepresidents and chief admissions officers of the collegesbelow  - chosenbecause most participated in the Eight-Year Study in thel93O's (seeabove)  - have signed a statement supporting and affirmingthe work ofeducational reform under way in schools across America."Ours is a timewhich calls for the ambitious redesign of schools," thestatement reads,"and we recognize that institutions of higher education mustbe partnersin bringing forth the changes so urgently needed. We applaudtheseschools involved in endeavors which emphasize rigorousindependentthinking and the direct engagement of students in seriouswork, and wecommend their efforts to find effective means to restructureand improveeducation at all levels.

Don't wait until the crunch of folder-readingtime tospeak with admissions people.<li>Involve college faculty and admissions people in yourschool's work:student exhibitions, curriculum, committees, and admissionsvisits.<li>Be an advocate. Be willing to distinguish betweenstudents, toidentify their strengths and weaknesses. Even withoutgrades, you canconvey to colleges the information they need to make anappropriatematch.<li>Present summaries of portfolios, not the portfolio itself.<li>Provide information in a clear, concise manner. Ifnecessary, listconcepts covered in interdisciplinary courses (especiallymath andscience), books, and primary documents.<li>Avoid jargon. Many admissions officers are recentgraduates who do nothave an extensive background in educational theory andpractice.<li>Revise transcripts and student profile forms.

The carpeted corridors make their ownlogical maze around and up and down the stairways, and bright wall graphics markthe way towards the cafeteria, the school nurse, the library, the pool --Ishould be able, I tell myself, to find my way around. But in the din between thebells, as students swirl and settle into their classrooms, I am humbled andamazed at once by their easy, confident clatter; this intimidating complex istheir world to own. I can feel only too well what it must be like, coming inhere as a ninth-grader on the first day of school. You can be done for in aninstant here, if your sense of direction, like mine, is at all unsure.<p>   Back in the central lobby, where principal Craig Larson's glasswalled officesuite anchors my directional sense again, a film crew from the local televisionstation is arriving for the day. The school is in the news, for better or worse;a group of parents has protested to the school board about Parkway's policy ofeliminating separate honors classes in English and social studies in the ninthgrade. Larson takes it as an opportunity; impeccable as always in suit and tie,his countenance serene, he is ready for the first of the interrogations on TVand radio that will follow. No, he explains, advanced students are not beingstripped of   their challenges; they will simply mingle in class as in real lifewith others of different abilities. As in life, they will take challenges to amore advanced level the more capable they are and in doing so, will motivate andsupport their fellow students of every stripe. One learns best, he points out,when one must explain something to another person, work in a group with others,stand before people to demonstrate something in a clear and interesting way.These things are the basis of what the Coalition of Essential Schools is aimingfor; and Parkway South, rather than limiting its Essential School program to the100-per-class system it has practiced for the last three yea: here in this St.Louis suburb, is bringing it now into the mainstream of school life.<p>   This year Parkway's seniors are back to standard 52-minute classes; no longerare some led by the special teams of four teachers that shepherded them throughsophomore and junior years. Though this is partly so they might take senioryearelectives, it also can be laid to a new philosophy at Parkway South that everyclass can be "essential" --teachers are being encouraged to forminterdisciplinary teams as they themselves see fit. Because he believes suchchange cannot and should not be imposed from above on the 1830 students and 120teachers here, Larson is negotiating a delicate transitionary step --"one stepbackward," as program coordinator Patrick Conley puts it, "for two steps ahead."<p>   But the students who piloted Parkway's Essential program are worried aboutthe change, and it only takes a day in the labyrinth of these halls to see why.In groups of three or four or a dozen all day, they tell me what they fear: thatteachers will not know their names any more; that the other students in theirclasses will be strangers to them again; that they will lose the precious sense,built day after day over the past three years, that they matter personally totheir teachers and to each other. They have not been lost in their school sincefreshman year --not in the halls (which any fool can learn to negotiate in a dayor two, they tell me kindly) and not in their classrooms either.<p>   This is a big suburban school with offerings as broad as if it were a juniorcollege; 90 percent of its graduates go on to higher education; 20 percent ofits students are bused in from the city to achieve a racial mix. But I heard thesame story from the mostly black students at Walbrook High School, where in abasement corner of a forbidding concrete fortress on a downtown Baltimore hillthe first 80 or so Essential School graduates are conducting their finalexhibitions every day now. And I heard it on the small and well-groomed campusof Whitfield School, a midlevel private school in the St. Louis hierarchy ofeducational privilege. In these three very different settings --representativein many ways of the range that the Coalition of Essential Schools embraces --Imet with students for several days, privately and in small groups, asking themhow they felt about their experience in the Essential School. Their voices wererefreshingly frank and free, their opinions for the most part unmarred by thejargon of educational reform. But the message came through clearly, time aftertime: Of all the Essential School's "nine common principles," personalization isthe most important to kids.<p><hr><h2>"They Know Who You Are"</h2><hr>Billie Lawrence is a Parkway South senior; her laugh is infectious as she pokesfun at the attitudes she held for the first year she was in Parkway South'sEssential School program.<p>   "I was horrible at the beginning of last year," she says gaily. "I would justsit back and laugh and say to my friends how I didn't care about school. InsideI knew, though, that my teacher was really teaching me. By the end of the year,when it was time to do my projects and bring my parents in and pull it alltogether, I really cared about it. Truthfully, that's what brought me back toschool this year --I wanted them to see me change."<p>   The teacher she is talking about is Sally Hunter Williams, whose ContemporaryIssues class this year includes many who were part of the Essential Schoolprogram in Parkway South's first two years. Williams was one of the Coalitionteam that worked with these students in their cohort of 100 during their junioryear, and they speak of her with obvious affection, loyalty, and trust. "She hasa different approach for every kid," Billie says. "With one she might be stern,and with somebody else she might get down and beg him. She's like a mother to us--if you're working on a project she'll call to see if you have everything youneed, or she'll bring in an article that relates to it for you. One summer shecalled every one of us on the phone just to see how everything was going."<p>   Students were selected for Parkway's Essential program at random, bycomputer, though they also might request or refuse it; and like many otherstudents I talked with, Billie thought at first that they had been chosenbecause they "needed extra help." But the impression that the Coalition is fordummies dies fast when they get in the classroom, students say.<p>   "The work is not easier," says Mark Gray, a senior who traveled last year tothe CES Fall Forum, one of the few educational conferences where students areinvited to attend and participate. "But it is more personal, one on one --theteachers know who you are and the work is set up around the students, not aroundthe teacher. I got a lot better grades than I ever did before."<p><hr><h2>How Hard Do They Work?</h2><hr>About grades, with all their power to sort and rank, students wax voluble inthese groups. The resentment is palpable as they trade stories of how they gotthrough their conventional classes before their Coalition experiment began. Itis May, I remind myself; these are seniors chafing at their bonds, counting thedays until graduation. Still, they are experts already in their own oppression:they can cite chapter and verse of what a bad class is like, and they speak withwarmth of their reprieve.<p>   "I was in all honors classes my freshman year," says Parkway senior TammyBateman, one of those who piloted the Essential program in tenth grade. "I don'tremember anything I had that year. All I did, I would go to class, do my workand turn it in. I would just do enough so that I could get a good grade and thatwas it."<p>   In fact, most students find that their work in mixed-ability Essentialclasses is at least as challenging as what they did in classes tracked forhonors. "I used to sleep in my honors classes," says Monique Huntley, with atouch of hauteur. "As long as I studied for the test, I got by fine." An honorsclass is no guarantee of the student's engaging with ideas, they insist to myskeptical questioning; in many cases, it is even more competitive, more centeredaround test-taking and grades. "In my honors class this year there's no personalrelationship with the teacher," says another senior. "The teacher gives younotes, he lectures, you copy things off the board, you take the test. At the endof the period you use the last few minutes to talk to your friends."<p>   In their Essential classes, honors students contract for extra work --morereadings, more elaborate presentations, peer tutoring --that will qualify themfor an honors grade. At least one senior girl told me she was disappointed bythat system. "It might have been good for the people I was supposed to behelping," she says. "But to me it just seemed like busywork. We just had to domore than the others, but we didn't really learn as much as before."<p>   "I was worried about that when I started in the program," says Tammy Bateman."But for me the honors contracts worked out fine. We had to do our presentationsbefore the others did, and they had to be more elaborate. The others would getmotivated by us, and we benefit because we had to read more and do more. I stillgot the quantity, but I think the quality was more than in my straight honorsclasses."<p><hr><h2>Exhibitions as Motivation</h2><hr>"In tenth and eleventh grades, we couldn't sleep any more," Monique adds. "Wehad to stay awake, or we would miss something." The reason, the group decides,is that their Coalition classes were centered around activities, rather thannotetaking. When they had to prepare in small groups for presentations, theysay, the stakes went up.<p>   "You don't know you're working harder," says Robert Huitt. "You want to."Senior Thanh Nguyen agrees. "If you're just studying for a test, no one has toknow if you get it wrong," he says. "But if you have to get up there and presentsomething, you don't want to be mumbling something you don't know about in frontof everybody."<p>   Moreover, students say, they often learn more from each other in discussionsthan they do from the teacher. "Everybody has a different viewpoint on things,"says Tammy Bateman. "If you listen to what everyone in the class thinks, youhave to come up with your own view." This is similar to what happens at testtime, she notes, and so substituting classroom exhibitions for tests is fairerto students. "People have different ways of thinking," she argues. "On a test,you have to be thinking the way the teacher is thinking, even down to how shewords the question. If you happen to be thinking from another perspective,that's your problem. A presentation gives you the chance to show how youinterpret facts."<p>   Such demonstrations of mastery (see HORACE, Volume 6, No. 3) are fairer thantests in another way, these kids point out: they make it not only hard but"unnecessary" to cheat. "In most classes your aim is to get in there, find outas much as possible about the test, and then get out," says one girl. "InCoalition you don't have a reason to do that, because you don't do thepresentation until you really know the stuff and you're ready." Another studentadds, "There's an incentive not to cheat. In history, you'll have to read someinteresting pages, not too many, and the teacher lets you write down notes on anindex card and take it into the test. You hand it in with the test, so he cansee what you got out of it." The group falls again to discussing Ms. Williams'sclass, where "the class isn't built around the test," one girl says. "We justdiscuss something until she says, 'Is everybody ready for the test?' and if not,we stay on it longer." Besides, senior Mike Keehnast points out, "It's abouttrust. If the teacher trusts you, you would feel guilt, if nothing else."<p><hr><h2>Will They Still Be Special?</h2><hr>So what's it like to be in class these days? I ask students at Parkway South,where the special "Coalition program" has been phased out in favor ofintegrating Essential School pedagogy into every class throughout the school.Here at least, seniors who were in the special program for the previous twoyears are feeling its loss. Now that periods are back to their shorter lengthand the team approach is optional, they say, the intimacy they experiencedthrough the earlier structure is diminished. That sense of belonging to aconstant group of manageable size, with teachers who knew each other and eachstudent, was foremost in students' priorities at every one of the schools Ivisited.<p>   In practical terms, eliminating the special structure for the senior yearmeans more electives can be scheduled in, points out Parkway's coordinatorPatrick Conley, and some of these may be necessary to graduate. But seniors saythey miss the longer time blocks that allowed them to spend more time on asubject, to explore its relation to other areas of knowledge, and --theyemphasize this benefit consistently --to take field trips together as a group.<p>   Their travels --to tour a nuclear power plant, to visit a college, to teacharts and crafts to younger children in a camp - were "educational," they say,tying in to their schoolwork in different ways. But it is also clear that thefield trips symbolize the unity this group feels so keenly, and that for themthis unity plays a key role in the Essential program's success. Even ifclassroom techniques do gradually change to a more student-centered approach,they worry that this aspect will be lost. To work best, they suggest, perhapsother teachers and students will have to be teamed in more of the 100-studentgroups that marked the first few years. The school has no plans to impose such astructure just now, but teachers are being encouraged to propose and designteams for themselves, and the arrangements will be supported when schedules aredesigned.<p>   Interestingly, students are skeptical that wholesale Coalitionstyle teamingwould fly at Parkway South. Those who have been successful in a more traditionalsystem will be suspicious, they warn. "You hear 'individual attention' and youthink you're going to be in a room all by yourself with none of your friends,"says one student. "You worry about being different. But for us, the kids who didwant it kind of pushed the reluctant ones. And almost everybody came back. Wehad no dropouts last year in the Coalition group."<p>   At Walbrook, too, a markedly fervent group spirit infuses the classes whohave gone through their high school years as part of an Essential School team.Coordinator Marian Finney --so beloved by her students that she sometimes has tobarricade herself and other teachers in for a private lunch ("where we can talkabout the kids," she says) --laughs at how possessive the seniors have becomeabout their program. But the degree of individual attention these students getis no laughing matter at Walbrook, which for two years has shared the giganticstructure that is Southwestern High School while its own building is stripped ofasbestos. With almost no windows and with security guards at the doors, thisbuilding makes Parkway South look like a country club; in it, Walbrook EssentialSchool coexists with Walbrook "regular school" as well as with Southwestern.Next year, Sam Billups will become coordinating principal for both Southwesternand Walbrook, and because he was the guiding spirit behind the original WalbrookEssential School, some in the program speak eagerly of the changes that mayfollow. As at Parkway South, though, the students are worried --and it's aboutthe very same thing: Might they lose the precious intimacy that has seen themthrough an Essential schooling?<p>   "The Coalition is like a family," says senior Dianne Goodman. She is a sturdygirl with a determined and authoritative air; in ninth grade she wanted to dropout of school because it was so hard, she says, but "Ms. Finney told me, 'Youcan be something, or you can be nothing at all."' Now, she says, she can go to ateacher for help with anything, academic or personal. "We're here to learn," shesays,"but we also have fun, because we know each other. They teach us more thanmath and all; they teach us common sense and common courtesy, and we learn."<p>   It's hard to get Walbrook students to say anything at all critical abouttheir program; they bring a devotion to their teachers that sweeps like a freshbreeze through this windowless concrete basement. And when you look around atthe walls, the blackboards, the ways students talk with teachers, it is easy tosee that Essential School principles have become the air that this school-within-a-school breathes. "Essential questions" --about love and honor, aboutjustice and power --are posted in almost every classroom. In Marian Finney'soffice the blackboard list of who has been accepted to what colleges is dailyupdated. In the classroom where we meet I admire an elaborate Egyptian frieze,complete with hieroglyphics, designed and painted by the toughest group of youngmen you might find on any street corner. You did this? I ask them around thetable, amazed. How? They look at me with mingled pride and scorn. <i>Research</i>, theysay.<p><hr><h2>They Expect Success</h2><hr>The expectation of success, after their four years at Walbrook, comes throughagain and again as I sit around tables with these students who talk withanimation of what their program means to them. "It's designed for us," saysNathan Scovens, an articulate senior who was assigned to the Essential program"so I wouldn't get lost" when he moved back to Baltimore from Texas three yearsago. "The teachers don't let you just sit back; they don't settle for less,because they know you from the first day when you walk in."<p>   "And the students don't let you either," says U'Vonda DeLoatch. "If you get a70 on something, they'll see it and they'll say, You can do better than that.It's not just the teachers pushing you, it's your peers too." In the first yearsof the program, she remembers, there was a required daily tutorial hour beforeschool; but the logistics of being housed at Southwestern has made thattemporarily impossible, and students say they miss it despite a long lunch hourin which they can get help.<p>   Though as at Parkway South they were mostly selected for the program atrandom, the Walbrook Essential kids clearly regard themselves as superior to therest of the school by now. "From the ninth grade we're put in the position wherewe're expected to do better than the other kids," says junior Lamontee Briggs.The group agrees that this is partly because "we get more coaching than theregular kids," and that "everybody thinks we get more advantages, like fieldtrips." But like the Parkway South students I spoke with, they hotly defend theeducational nature of their group trips. "Even if we go to a movie, we have tocome back and write about it!" said one boy.<p>   Their pride in the results is obvious. "When we go out to compete againstother schools, Walbrook wins things," says Dianne Goodman, "but WalbrookEssential <i>cleans up!</i>" All of the ten seniors around the table with her say theywill go to college next year, and many have won scholarships or received city-wide academic achievement awards. Moreover, says junior Latanya Robinson,"There's no such thing as a nerd in the Coalition. If you're doing your best andyou do well, everybody thinks it's cool." On the contrary, a friend puts in: "Ifyou do something and you <i>don't</i> get the credit, you get mad for yourself and forthe rest of the group."<p>   So what can go wrong in an Essential program, in Walbrook students' eyes?They have a teacher shortage this year, they complain; some of their classeshave up to 35 students. Working in small groups isn't always easy, one says,especially "if the people within the group don't know how to do it --if you justget thrown in to sink or swim." Sometimes the longer periods begin to wear on, afew students say; but the fact that they meet on alternate days makes up for it."We get attention --sometimes <i>too</i> much!" one senior gripes cheerfully; if youskip school, someone notices right away. Still, prying suggestions for changeout of the forty-odd students I spoke with at Walbrook was a tough proposition;more than half of one group of seniors declared that they would want to comeback and teach at a school like this some day. "We've been together for fouryears, and we have a sense of pride," says Nathan Scovens. "We can't bedefeated."<p><hr><h2>What About the Small School?</h2><hr>At Walbrook, the Essential School approach clearly has given direction and prideto a student population that otherwise might well be passed over in oureducational system. At Parkway South, it has managed to reduce the strains thata very big school, no matter how privileged its students, can put on kids. Butwhat of a school like St. Louis's Whitfield School, where students alreadyaccustomed to the personal scale and individual attention of a private-schooleducation are encountering the shift in pedagogy that Essential Schools espouse?<p>   Whitfield students notice the change right away, they say --in the Englishclasses of teacher Mike McGlew, the social studies classes of Billy Handmaker,the science classes of Anne Chorley. They describe with alacrity the differencebetween a "read-and-regurgitate" classroom approach and a studentcentered one.<p>   "They're not trying to lecture you and tell you what to think," says AnnaGiuliani, a senior at Whitfield. "They're trying to get you to think foryourself, to develop and support your own ideas." Whitfield's small size, shesays, contributes to the success of that method --few classes have more than tenstudents --but it could work as well in a class of 25 students. "We had to spenda day in English class at the beginning of the year just learning how to run aclass like that --how to have a discussion without interrupting each other," shesays.<p>   Their best classes, Whitfield students say, forego textbooks in favor ofreadings and hands-on experiments. "For half the year we haven't used the bookin chemistry," Anna says. "In history, Mr. Handmaker had us read the CommunistManifesto, then something on Nicaragua by Salman Rushdie, then something by theAfrican writer Chinua Achebe. We combine a lot of literature, art, and history.You understand a lot more, you can interpret it better, and it's more memorableespecially if you're better at one thing, like art, than you are at another."<p>   A striking exception to the enthusiasm students express for their Essentialclasses is their conviction that altering traditional math instruction is not aneasy thing to pull off. Many math teachers, they say, can only teach one skilllevel at once, and the kids who are quicker to grasp things are impatient whenthey are held back. At Whitfield, math is taught in the conventionally sequencedway, and at Parkway South, several students told me that their "Coalition math"classes had bombed, leaving them scrambling this year to catch up in moretraditional classes. Still, at Walbrook students did praise Essential Schoolmath classes. "There's not necessarily one right answer, even in math," saysNathan Scovens. "It's challenging, because there's always a second way we cantry out. In a regular math class, if you have a formula, that's it --you don'tneed or desire any more."<p>   The work is more demanding in student-centered classes, Whitfield studentsagree, but they often hardly realize it-a comment I heard from students at otherschools as well. "It doesn't seem so nose-to-the-grindstone, punch-out-those-answers," says junior John Brunjes, who was initially mistrustful, he says, ofthe different teaching style he encountered at Whitfield. "At first I thought,What are they doing? It seems to waste so much time. But now, in conversationaround the dinner table at home, I see that my questions and answers arebecoming more original. I can talk to my younger sister about what Prohibitionis, say, and I can talk to my dad about the ideas involved, and how it relatesto things now."<p>   For John, who is dyslexic, Essential School teaching "gives people a broaderrange to do well in. If you're good at memorization, maybe you do well in theother kind of class. But if you can take things and sort them out in your mindand <i>do</i> something with them, come up with a new idea, you do better in classeslike this. The teacher directs you, but you learn mostly from the otherstudents. You bang your heads together and you get sparks, but if there'ssomething else in there, you get fire."<p>   Though kids at every school seemed to take new energy and enthusiasm fromEssential School classes, they were all quick to point out that "it's not foreveryone." Honors students who have done well in lecture-style courses mayresent it, says Parkway senior Angie Gunn. "They want to just take it in, keepmoving, spit it back, get their grades, not be held back by Joe here who doesn'tget it." Still, these dissatisfied students are hard to locate. One of the fewwho was willing to say the new ways were not for HIM was Court Levy, a junior atWhitfield who says he gets lower grades here for the same amount of work thatwould get him A's at another school.<p>   "My friend who goes to public school comes over to use my computer, and he'sall stressed out because he has to write a paper," Court says in irritation."It's the first paper he's had to write all year in any of his classes! Here Ihave to write papers every weekend, anywhere from a page or two up to fivepages. My grades would definitely be better even if I put in less work if I wentto his school --which is supposed to be a good school."<p>   This isn't fair to him in a couple of ways, Court argues. "You go to highschool, you want to have fun," he admits. But also, he says, he's worried: Willcollege admissions officers recognize that his grades stand for a wholedifferent set of expectations? Indeed, both getting into college and what itwill be like once they are there is a subject that juniors and seniors at everyschool speculate about incessantly. Nobody's going to hold your hand once you'rein college, they say --will they be spoiled by all this individual attention?<p>   Prodded, they admit that the skills they are acquiring just might be usefulin college regardless. "I can sit down and write an essay now," says ParkwaySouth's Billie Lawrence with satisfaction. Her classmate Mike Keehnast agrees."Coalition teachers expect you to take initiative --you can't just go to class,you have to write, and get up and make presentations, and prepare for life."<p>   In what they call "real life" --not, clearly, where they feel they are now --they are more confident that these skills will serve them well. "You need tohave more than book smarts," says Parkway's Monique Huntley. "You need to useyour head. Coalition gives you that." In the real world, Amy Jaeger adds,"you're going to meet people smarter than you and people under you, and if youdon't know how to work with different kinds, that will hurt you." And somestudents acknowledge, like Whitfield's John Brunjes, that in life outside schoolthey already approach discussions differently. "Say I'm up against a completelyunfamiliar situation outside school, like getting in an argument," tenth-graderDebbie Becker told me. "I can break things down into questions, and I know thesteps to get to the answers."<p>                                          Just how much of all this praise should be attributed to the "Hawthorneeffect," which can appear to make almost any new project successful just becausepeople are excited and energized by something intriguingly new? Of course, thesekids can't tell, and neither can we, aside from noting the incontrovertibleevidence that paying more personal attention to students goes a long way towardeducating them better. Until Essential schools have been around for a while, itwill be hard to disentangle the other rewards of the approach itself from thosedue to the special attention and enthusiasm it generates.<p>   Still, spending time with these students left me with an eerie shift ofperspective, after having written about this movement for two years from a moretheoretical, more political, more analytical point of view. I saw a reformmovement from the bottom up, stripped of the structure of its overarchingtheories, its jargon, its adult agendas. In students' words, time and again, Iheard poignant echoes of the nine common principles, framed in the most personalof terms. The altering of what goes on in their classrooms may register only asa "bad teacher, good teacher" contrast --and only a fool would insist that goodteachers all fit some definitive Coalition pattern. Inarguably, though, thesekids do notice what goes on in their classes. They tell "before" stories inhair-raising detail --kids falling asleep with Walkmans on in the back of theclass, <i>teachers</i> falling asleep at the front. They know the difference between ateacher sick of kids and one who respects them, between a class where they sitdoodling and what they call a "fun class" --"where you have time to share youropinion, where you're listened to," as Parkway's Tammy Bateman says. "I mean,things are going through <i>your</i> mind, too." Even if the common principles ofEssential Schools do nothing but acknowledge that, I left these schoolsthinking, these kids are better served. <p><hr>                        <h2>      One Student's View: "This all sounded too simple"</h2><hr>   In many classrooms in many schools people have ideas on the way that schoolsshould be run. Over generations our ancestors have developed ideas on what agood learning environment is. This idea is strange because it has never beenquestioned. And why not? Japan is leaving the U.S. behind in productivity as wespeak. Why does this happen? Some people believe that we are focusing on thewrong thing in our educational system. What I have just stated is prettygeneric. Most people have already heard about this problem, and we ask ourselvesthe question: "What do we need to do to make the U.S. educational system morecompetitive?" Well some people claim that smaller classrooms and differentexpectations of the student and teacher are necessary. This all sounded to metoo simple.<p>   At first glance these suggestions for a new educational system looked good onpaper. I was a little skeptical about this. I would be much more willing toaccept it if it were proven to me in actuality. I did not think this could bedone easily. Because subjects like chemistry and aIgebra are so direct andstraightforward it would be hard to carry out a different relationship betweenstudents and teachers, since classes like these cannot be taught any other wayexcept by good explanations, examples, and hours of patient listening. Englishor history, on the other hand, I believed would not have the same kind oftrouble. These classes seem to be a little more subjective. The teacher can givethe students more freedom to mingle among themselves about questions, a book orstory, or what should have been done or should be done about happenings in theworld. But the other aspect to be considered was will the students use thisfreedom to their benefit.<p>   This was all proven wrong to me when I saw the system work, and work well ina class of mine. It didn't work well at first. It did take some time. Theinstructor took the attitude of the observer. "The less I do for the students inproblem solving for their assignments, the better off they are. They need totalk to themselves and their friends because that is who they will always havein order to answer their questions in life to come." When this was given to thekids it really confused them. They had no idea of what the teacher wanted. Theycouldn't distinguish between what was relevant to English and what was not.l'hey just did not understand the system which was given to them. And, you can'tblame them. If Albert Einstein had been given a calculator nothing would havestopped him. But unless you taught him to use it, all it was was a $3 piece ofplastic.<p>   Because the plan had not been worked out it fell on its face. The instructorbacked up and forgot about English for about six weeks. During this time hesubliminally showed the class what his goals were. One by one everything startedto fall in place. The role of the teacher and the role of the student and therole of the work became clear. Once this huge ball started rolIing nothingstopped it. It couldn't stop. It could slow down, but never grind to a stop,which I feel happens quite often in other classrooms. Everyone takes such pridein what they are doing. Grades are exceptional.<p>   The reason that so much pride is taken is because the subjects that are usedmatter. I'll give an example. If someone asks you a question and you know theanswer, you are no smarter than before. If you ask someone a question becauseyou don't know the answer and they give you an answer back, you probably won'tremember because you don't care. If you cared, you would know the answer. Butlet's say you thought up a question for yourself. The question must matter toyou because you thought it up. So, no matter where you get your answer, whethersomeone gives it to you or you find it out yourself chances are you won't forgetit. This is the theory I think is used in this English class, and should beexecuted in more classes, where feasible.<p>           --John Brunjes, eleventh grade, Whitfield School<p><hr>                             <h2> Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or comingeditions.

<html><head><title>CES: Publications: Horace: 9-3: Managing the Change Process</title></head><body><hr><h1><center>"So Now What?" <br>Managing the Change Process</center></h1><hr><center>Volume 9, Number 3     <br>January 1993</center><hr>Judy Cunningham can put her finger right on what turned the tide of change at Rancho San Joaquin, where for seven years she has led some 50 teachers and 900 diverse 7th and 8th grade students. Plenty of teachers, parents, students, unions, administrators were skeptical, she readily admits, when Essential School ideas first surfaced in this Irvine, California school community.<p>   "At first people's concerns were just informational," she says. "They wanted to know more." But soon enough, that evolved into other, quite legitimate concerns: "How is all this going to affect me personally?" she remembers them asking. "Why fix something that ain't broke?"<p>   So Cunningham worked to turn the very exploration of such questions into the whole point -- helping the members of the school community work through what she calls "stages of concern," at their own individual paces, until new norms of trust and collaboration could take hold. Drawing ideas from a well-known organizational change model and from training sessions offered through the Coalition's National Re:Learning Faculty, she and her staff together started learning how to set clear goals they could agree on, and how to work together respectfully in carrying them out.<p>   Today Rancho San Joaquin is a different school by all accounts, and the people who work there have made it that way themselves. It has gone from tracking to virtually complete heterogeneous grouping; teacher teams in "village" units are working toward an integrated curriculum; and teachers and students report a new climate of respect for learning. At its most recent faculty meeting, the staff decided to require consensus on any issue that affects all students. More than half the school's teachers belong to the voluntary committee that plans and evaluates professional development activities. And one teacher works full time as a staff development coach -- encouraging every teacher to explore new ideas, try new classroom practices, and reflect collaboratively on how they work.<p>   Watching schools like this one change, it's clear that, for reform efforts to get anywhere, people must continually juggle at least three balls in the air at once. Simultaneously, Rancho San Joaquin is 1) changing its <i>teachers' classroom practices</i>, 2) changing its <i>beliefs and attitudes</i> through an open and ongoing conversation about education in the school and community, and 3) examining the school's <i>structure</i> and questioning how it works and how to change it. Any one of these continually shifting elements supplies multiple entry points into bigger changes -- and any one of them will inevitably affect the others.<p>   But exactly how does a school carry out this tricky process? How do successful schools turn a vision into practice, given the established structure and workings of their organization? What do they do first? Are some training workshops more important than others? What kinds of committees and other structures and procedures are required? What current committees and structures (site-based management, for example, or special magnet programs) must either fit into the change somehow or be eliminated? How can a school counteract the stresses and conflicts that serious change inevitably involves?<p><hr><h2>First, Teach Teamwork</h2><hr>The answer, many school-watchers say, lies not in a 1-2-3 formula, because so much of a school's experience is unique to its own situation. Instead, it lies in getting people to understand how the process of change is crucial to whether new substance will take hold -- a powerful mix of vision and teamwork that is far easier said than done. "Regardless of what specific plans a school has, they will succeed if those involved set clear goals and use teamwork to carry them out," says Faith Dunne, a Dartmouth College education professor who helps lead the Coalition's Building Effective School Teams (BEST) institute. "If they don't do that," she flatly declares, "no change is going to work."<p>   The overarching task of learning teamwork and goal-setting puts the other tasks of school reform into a new perspective. For one thing, every step the school considers -- instituting advisory periods, or changing the schedule, or de-tracking, or integrating the curriculum -- now becomes an opportunity to practice the skills of goal-setting and teamwork. In turn, the real conflicts any serious change engenders ("What? You're taking away my honors class?") get the attention they deserve; and people learn the hard business of listening respectfully, gathering information, negotiating differences, and building consensus.<p>   "When we realized an atmosphere of condemnation was developing toward those reluctant to change, we made a conscious effort to dispel it," says Judy Cunningham. Once the "we-they" dynamic shifted, she asserts, "things could really start to happen. We were all hearing the same things in our staff development, after all. Everyone understood that new ways were going to be expected of everyone -- <i>but not right now</i>. We committed ourselves to giving support and building skills, so that everyone could take part when they felt ready enough to do so, and not before."<p>   Teaching people to work together, of course, is itself a structural and philosophical change. It requires, for instance, making time within the teachers' salaried work day and year for coaching and practice in collaborative work. And perhaps most important, it requires thinking of teachers as crucial players in the very redesign of their profession. Suddenly instead of being technicians who must be conscripted into cooperation, teachers are professionals whose thoughtful questions, ideas, and objections will inform a new intellectual climate for the schools and shape the way they work.<p>   Getting people to work together, moreover, has a direct bearing on the "Now what?" question that frequently stumps schools shaping their change strategies. Because the Coalition of Essential Schools is organized entirely around common intellectual principles (not around specified practices like team-teaching or block scheduling), it has long been reluctant to lay out management and procedural guidelines for schools that have embraced those broad principles. Even such well-regarded techniques as site-based management, CES leaders point out, do not of themselves spark thoughtful pedagogy, curriculum, or assessment. Nonetheless, a long-range intention to involve teachers in collaboratively shaping and evaluating new practice does lie at the heart of every kind of support the Coalition offers member schools.<p>   The National Re:Learning Faculty, for example, has brought some hundred teachers, principals, and administrators to Brown University for intensive coaching on Essential School ideas -- and sends them back prepared to work with colleagues as critical friends and coaches. Since 1988 CES's Trek program has guided school teams through a year-long reflective analysis, including setting goals, designing action plans and decision-making structures, and visiting other schools to observe and reflect on their progress. Last summer, two one-week BEST institutes at CES trained more than a dozen school teams to facilitate whatever change agendas their schools had set. And through its Exhibitions project, led by Joseph McDonald, the Coalition has devised a change process organized around "planning backwards," which several schools have received funding to try.<p>   The woods are full of other good strategies for managing organizational change, of course, and many successful Essential schools have turned to non-Coalition sources for help. Rancho San Joaquin relies on a program called Concern-Based Adoption Model (CBAM), designed by Gene Hall of the University of Florida.  Fairdale High School in Jefferson County, Kentucky draws from Edward Deming's Total Quality Management process for their consensus decision-making.  Central Bucks East High School in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, uses a change model described in Herbert Simon's book <li>administrative behavior; and several Coalition member schools have used Peter Senge's "systems thinking" approach. James Comer's School Development Program at Yale, one of the Coalition's new partners in the ATLAS school change project recently funded by the New American Schools Development Corporation, offers a three-stage process that some Coalition schools have taken to heart. <p>   Whatever the method for learning to work together, everybody agrees, it doesn't happen quickly or easily. At stake, after all, is a hierarchical authoritarian, isolationist bureaucracy so deeply entrenched in our notion of schooling that it is hard even to imagine it differently. Plenty of vested interests -- standardized test companies, college admissions, school boards, teacher unions -- keep the status quo going in the old tracks if nothing challenges business as usual. It can easily take a couple of years for a core group from a school to learn teamwork well enough to be able to teach it to others. And to get a whole school used to working together toward change could well take five years, organizational change research suggests.<p>   Equally important, it may not be much fun. "Real change only starts when you run up against resistance," says Faith Dunne. "No resistance signals that you're not changing anything serious." That's why school change analysts regard learning to cope with and manage conflict as a key part of making any change happen. At the Coalition's Fall Forum, workshops on faculty resistance led by psychologist Robert Evans, who directs the Human Relations Service in Wellesley, Massachusetts, were packed to overflowing, and his counsel -- to identify with the concerns of the reluctant, and address them directly and openly -- fits neatly into several of the change strategies Coalition member schools have embraced. (See "What Schools Can Learn from Resistant Teachers.")<p><hr><h2>The Key Task: Clear Goals</h2><hr>Given that a school does commit to this long, hard process and finds ways -- either through the Coalition or elsewhere -- to coach itself into effective teamwork, what actual tasks do these nascent cooperators have to address? Even after they've made the commitment to adopt Essential School ideas, many schools simply stall out in the face of a daunting array of challenging principles and a staff leery of too much change all at once.<p>   Though the specific content of each move will depend on each school's particular situation, virtually all effective change models call for some version of the same basic steps:*<p><ol><li>Agree that a problem needs solution.<li>Set clear goals that get beyond surface issues.<li> Understand what in the school's current structure and culture works for and   against these goals.<li> Establish a participatory structure that allows those affected to organize   how and when changes will happen -- one that can accommodate new ideas and   conflict when they arise.<li> Start making the changes in an orderly way according to that process, which   must include steps for ongoing evaluation and reflection.</ol><p>* These steps draw on the guidelines of the School Leadership Project based at  Dartmouth College, but many other models reflect a similar process.<p>   The first two steps -- agreeing that a problem exists, and setting goals to solve it -- sound deceptively simple. But they lie at the heart of many of the stumbling blocks to Essential School reform, argues Theodore Sizer, who began the Coalition eight years ago in an effort to remedy high school students' "intellectual docility" and raise the standards by which their work is judged. "High schools that believe 'it ain't broke' need to take a careful and collective look," he says, "at the quality of their student work, and identify where problems exist." Until every graduating student can demonstrate competence in rigorous and clearly defined thinking skills, Sizer asserts, a school has a problem that its entire community should be able to agree on.<p>   But embracing the Coalition's Nine Common Principles, or even drawing up an idealistic mission statement, only marks the start of the real challenge, change analysts say. Rather, the school's faculty must start to define how those principles might play out in new practices, and then articulate the new goals that arise.<p>   Those goals might be pedagogical: "Every senior must qualify for graduation by exhibiting mastery of the following competencies." They could be structural: "Class periods will be long enough to address a subject in depth." They could encompass both structural and pedagogical aims: "We'll integrate our curriculum across the disciplines," or "We'll teach students of differing abilities to work together in the same classes." If they are serious goals, they will generate controversy, and that should be welcome; if no one's interests are offended by them, they probably merely reflect the status quo.<p>   A number of Coalition member schools are generating these goals by the "planning backwards" strategy CES's Joseph McDonald has described in several studies. The faculty begins by framing in their minds' eyes a specific and concrete task they want to see candidates for graduation exhibit -- not quite an "outcome," which may be too abstract to imagine in the context of everyday teaching tasks, but a performance that demonstrates that outcome.<p>   Chicago's Sullivan High School makes a good example of how starting with such a goal leads to logical and thoughtful steps toward change. Under the challenging leadership of principal Robert Brazil, the school community agreed that Socratic seminars would serve as the core educational experience at this large urban high school. Every graduate, they decided, should be able to read sophisticated texts and thoughtfully discuss them in seminars, then write about the ideas generated. So Sullivan devised a "diploma by exhibition" that would ask all seniors to publicly demonstrate those skills.<p>   Next, they struggled to define what would have to happen in their school so a student might learn to carry out such a task -- what kind of classroom experiences, what kind of practice assignments, what kind of teacher preparation, what kind of assessment? Sullivan started by involving all students and staff in quarterly "all-school seminars" and monthly "enrichment seminars," but soon decided to practice seminar techniques in every subject and with every student. Once the first Sullivan students went through the new graduation requirement, the staff recognized substantial weaknesses in their written work, which led to systematic curricular changes across the disciplines.<p>   As weak points show up in the existing system, schools can begin to "rewire," as McDonald dubs the hard process of changing norms and procedures so that they contribute to common goals. (Sullivan teachers, for instance, developed consistent rubrics that could be used in every class to evaluate written work and seminar participation.) Part of the rewiring process, McDonald points out, is a continual "tuning" of decisions -- soliciting and responding to feedback about the school's performance from interested outsiders of all stripes. (Sullivan uses Mortimer Adler's Paideia Project as a continuing source of teacher education, self-evaluation, and new ideas.)<p>   As soon as it began, the new exhibition requirement allowed the Sullivan community to look together at what graduating students knew and what they could in fact do -- not in the future but at that moment. If the results are taken seriously, Joe McDonald argues, such a concrete goal can generate a logical series of moves toward new norms and institutions at the school. From its new perspective the whole school community both celebrates its demands on students and evaluates those demands -- reflecting together on where students should be going and what needs to happen to get them there.<p>   In Sullivan's case, those new norms included academic rigor, heterogeneous grouping, and cross-disciplinary challenges -- all generated by one simple imaginative act, collectively undertaken. "By requiring that all our students demonstrate the competencies we had earlier demanded from only a few," Sullivan teacher Eileen Barton says of the experience, "we discovered they could not only meet our expectations but were willing to work harder than ever before to do so." The graduation exhibition has become an institution at Sullivan now -- involving all teachers and all students in a conscious and everyday movement toward their own clearly defined goal.<p><hr><h2>Look for the Energy</h2><hr>Such success stories point to the clear gains a school can make if it agrees what it wants and has a system in mind for getting it. But many practitioners prefer chaos theory to neater methods as a guiding principle in the messy realities of school reform. Like the defiant child who says, "I'll do it because I want to, and not because you said to," they assert, change will resist formulas, happening only when and where it is ready to. And astute reformers, like observant parents, may know more by instinct than by rules what to do and when.<p>   "I see an organization in terms of physical science," says Chuck Bowen, a Thomson Fellow who is principal of Broadmoor Junior High School in Pekin, Illinois. "When you want to move the organization, you have to apply energy to it." To answer a school's "Now what?" question, Bowen suggests, its leaders must locate the friction points where its energy already gathers -- by listening for the conflicts, the heartfelt concerns, the dissatisfaction, and the needs perceived by the people who make up the organization. "If you start out with something logically," Bowen argues, "you won't draw from that energy source."<p>   For Broadmoor, the obvious hot spot was the staff's grave dissatisfaction with the school's organizational structure. "Teachers felt isolated, unhappy with how business was being done, frustrated because they had no time to get together," Bowen recalls. "That was the energy source that drove change, so our substantive emphasis at first was highly teacher-centered." Within two years, Broadmoor had redesigned its structure from a conventional seven-period day to a two-house team-based system with a long-block schedule providing teams with 70 minutes a day and an extra half-day monthly for common planning time.<p>   "But organizations are tied together so tightly with roles and expectations that you can't change just one thing," Bowen notes. The issues of curriculum and instruction that emerged, he says, created conflicts which became the school's new hot spots. "After a while the very fact that conflicts and concerns keep arising becomes an energy source itself," he says. "That keeps everyone thinking about where new ones in future are going to come up -- which in turn directs our energy toward future planning."<p>   The scenario could just as easily have started, as Ted Sizer recommends, with seeking faculty agreement on inadequate student performance and what to do about it. Pedagogical innovations like cooperative learning or exhibitions, Bowen notes, could generate structural conflicts; or poor communication could become the source of discontent, sparking attention to either classroom practice or school structure and governance. Again, these three areas -- pedagogy, structure, and communication -- continually shift positions as schools juggle the tasks of change; again, the dynamic is more important than any scripted sequence.<p>   And here again, giving shape to the whole process is the requirement for teamwork. Even to take the first step toward changing things, Bowen notes, the Broadmoor staff had to start learning to work together, a process guided by a team that attended the Coalition's first Trek year. Himself a former "school coach" and facilitator for Illinois Re:Learning, Bowen feels strongly that sustained outside help is essential to schools in the midst of change. "Just think of it as learning a highly complex and detailed craft that doesn't lend itself to being written down into well-structured steps," he says. "Other crafts like this use apprenticeship to teach their skills -- the master and the apprentice share the task, with the master taking on the tasks the apprentice can't yet do." Illinois Re:Learning requires and pays for school coaches to commit a half day weekly to each Coalition member school, and Bowen thinks the time could easily be doubled. "Our current coach offers us an impartiality I don't have any more," he says.<p>   Developing the skills of working together must precede even a school's earliest exploration of Essential School ideas, Bowen argues. When Broadmoor first investigated joining the Coalition, he says, "we set it up so that skeptics and converts were all represented on the steering committee set up to investigate it. All they had to commit to was doing a good job of learning about it so they could report back to the whole faculty." Before sending the group to their first CES symposium, the entire school met for two long sessions to develop a list of questions they assigned to their emissaries. "Some of us were learning about it so we could shoot it down; others because we wanted it to happen; others just to learn what the heck was going on," Bowen recalls. "But working together began from the very start."<p>   Once a staff's collective energy is trained on common goals, Bowen asserts, problems become easier to solve. "We made all our changes on a zero-based budget," he says. "In our first year of change we tried a new structure that didn't work, and had to live with it for a year. We stared that dilemma down, empowering a new committee to reorganize our schedule and house structure. The teachers sat down and made their own hard decisions -- to lay someone off, to save money by covering for each other on planned absences -- and it worked, because it wasn't some administrator telling them what to do."<p><hr><h2>A System for Participation</h2><hr>Broadmoor's system also works, in part, because the school follows a clear protocol of joint decision-making, in which everyone affected by any change has a say in making it, unmaking it, and getting it to succeed. "Many schools go through the Trek and come out with a diagnosis, a vision, and a plan," says Coalition senior associate Patricia Smith. But the Trek process must put a decision-making structure in place to facilitate change, she says, or they get stuck and the effort dissipates. Schools can also go astray when a Trek team coexists with a parallel movement toward site-based management, but the two fail to integrate their visions. "If you can instead use shared decision-making initiatives to decide on and carry out Essential School changes," says Smith, "then you have a new structure that includes the whole community, and the ball can really get rolling."<p>   For an example Smith points to Central Bucks East High School, a large suburban high school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Though it is not technically a site-based management school, Central Bucks East has consciously arranged its structure so that teachers are intimately involved with matters of educational leadership. An elected Leadership Team of six teachers, four parents, three administrators, and one student makes many policy decisions; and task forces form as necessary to study everything from communication to team-building and curriculum matters.<p>   "Making decisions as a team has increased communication tremendously," principal Joseph Jennelle says. "We've opened doors to conversation. There are so many variables in the Nine Common Principles -- we need to learn all we can about them and develop a common language. While we do that we're also learning how to talk together in a structured way, learn what each person feels is important, and make decisions together as a group."<p>   Some schools run into unexpected trouble because they forget to keep in close touch with parents and other community members. As principal Bob Mackin at Souhegan High School in Amherst, New Hampshire points out, "there's simply no limit to the amount of communicating you need to do with parents."<p>   Souhegan faced a particular challenge because it is a brand new school this year, says Mackin, who formerly headed Fox Lane High School, a Coalition member school in Bedford, New York. But the process of articulating Essential School change, he argues, is the same for every school.<p>   "We had a series of community meetings and newsletters to say 'We're rethinking what school should look like and here's why,'" he says. "We used lots of good examples of places already in existence, to give people a sense of security that we're not using their kids as guinea pigs." Mackin also sent out regular newsletters that served as a basis for discussion. "Writing reaches people who may not come to meetings," he notes.<p>   Building community understanding buys time for schools, Mackin says, "so you don't get accosted from day one when you start to change." Nonetheless, he says, given another chance he would do even more, and he recommends focusing meetings and newsletters on hot issues like heterogeneous grouping. "Two months into the year you can count on a challenge from the parents of the honors kids," he says. "You have to have confidence in the research -- but the community can't be left behind."<p><hr><h2>Keep Symbols of Stability</h2><hr>Ironically, Souhegan is riding high in its community at the moment partly because of its championship athletic teams. "If you're going to spend time and energy challenging norms," Mackin says, "do you challenge the football team or tracking? They're both deeply embedded in American culture." Unless expensive sports programs foreclose the possibility of crucial academic reforms, he has a point. Maintaining a few typical high school traditions simply as symbols -- designations like "juniors" and "seniors," or sports teams, or bells between classes, or A-B-C grading systems (at least for a time) -- can lend stability to a system that may feel overwhelmed by change, observes CES's Director for Schools Bob McCarthy.<p>   Even such symbols as the traditional honor roll, though, can be put to new uses, observes Rancho San Joaquin principal Judy Cunningham. Analyzing what most affected the school's persistent discipline problems, her faculty concluded that one key factor was students' work habits -- bringing materials to class, using time effectively, coming prepared for class, and class participation. They instituted a new Work Habits Honor Roll, measured every three weeks and rewarded with publicity and other positive incentives like sodas and "yogurt feeds." If a student drops off the honor roll in three or more classes, the parents are called in for an intervention, the student contracts for specific improvements, and a continuing evaluation of the cause of the problem begins. "It has made a remarkable difference," says Cunningham. "It's become the cool thing."<p>   Things like this can establish a necessary sense of order in the midst of change -- a quality that also shows up in the way successful schools organize their process of reform. New institutions and norms arise at such places -- regular meetings, for example, where educational ideas are discussed, their practical implications sorted out, the problems they raise addressed, and their early trials evaluated. At one Essential school, the principal has scheduled hour-long weekly "quality circles," of ten faculty members each, to discuss substantive issues. At another, monthly faculty meetings break into small groups to discuss readings and questions on matters like assessment practices. A third school devotes an afternoon each month to exploring the Nine Common Principles one by one, in depth.<p>   "It's important to have a structure for the change process," Chuck Bowen comments. "It's like the balancing stick a tightrope walker holds -- it helps you locate yourself in an unstable situation. But no model can tell you everything that can happen. You have to use these models intelligently, continually analyzing and criticizing how it works for you."<p>   In the end, no model can substitute for teaching people to work together, setting their own priorities that reflect their own situations and assessing their own progress against new standards of thoughtfulness. That is a tall order for educators long habituated to taking instruction like so many obedient children in neat rows of desks. But despite the time, effort, and pain that change of this order entails, a real hunger for just such large-scale transformation appears to be growing among those interested in Essential School ideas. As teachers see more serious attention paid to their own professional worth, more weight placed on their own honest inquiry into new ideas, the chances for real consensus only grow.<p>   "You see a lot of great mission statements on big posters hanging around schools," says Rancho San Joaquin teacher Erin Hughes. "But if you want me to implement what's on the paper, you have to include me, attend to my needs. The bottom line is, Do you want to change something on paper or do you want to change <i>people?</i>" <p>                                <hr>             <h2>  "Stages Of Concern" in One School's Change Process</h2><hr>Rancho San Joaquin School works toward change using these steps from the Concern-Based Adoption Model (CBAM), designed by Gene Hall of the University of Florida.<p><table> <tr>  6     |   Refocusing      |   Know Something Better           |</tr><p>   <tr>  5     |   Collaboration   |   Working with Others (Peers)     |  </tr><p>   <tr> 4     |   Consequence     |   How Affecting Clients           |  </tr><p>   <tr> 3     |   Management      |   Time, Materials, Organization   |  </tr><p>   <tr>   2     |   Personal        |   How Will it Affect Me?          |   </tr><p>   <tr>   1     |   Informational   |   Like to Know More               |   </tr><p>   <tr>  0     |   Awareness       |   Not Concerned                   |   </tr><p>  </table><hr><h2>One High School's Consensus Decision-Making Process</h2><hr> <b>The goal of all proposals and decision making                    must be greater student academic success:</b><p>     I .

Unless a school has the luxury of choosing its entire staff from the start, such a problem is virtually unavoidable. Some resistant teachers are opposed from the start -- they question the need for change, worry about losing their jobs, or just plain disagree with certain Coalition principles. Others start out uncommitted but lose heart as they discover how difficult and draining the change effort can be, often reverting to their old ways to reduce the stress.<p>   But rather than treat such resistance as a major stumbling block, reform veterans suggest, schools should instead regard them as an opportunity. If they are to sustain any forward move, change advocates need to thoroughly understand and respect opposing points of view, and then work together to resolve them so that each party can live with the results.<p>   This has especially important implications for how schools go about their change process. For example, teachers might resist a move like integrating disciplines, either because they feel unprepared for it academically or because they resent the loss of autonomy it presages. Understanding this could lead a school first to afford all staff ample time to learn about the new ideas (including watching them in action), at the same time actively inviting their participation and input, however critical. Then, rather than dictate one path all teachers will follow (like team-teaching), the school's leadership might encourage integration in small, less threatening dimensions that make clear its good points (and smooth its rough spots) more gradually.<p>   Understanding the point of view of dissenting teachers can also prompt more explicit support, both internal and external, for the difficult tasks of change. This might include training in collaborative work (both in decision making and in an instructional context). Or it might mean more time, money, and effort put into helping teachers try out new classroom techniques.<p>   "What really matters to your resistant teachers right now? How can you connect your reforms to where they are?" asks psychologist Robert Evans, a consultant to schools who offered workshops on resistant teachers at the Coalition's Fall Forum this year. Change leaders need to listen carefully to resistant teachers' concerns, he says, and revise their plans carefully on that basis. "You have to build bridges to the new ideas that have some foothold in the old ideas," he urges. The "old ideas" often include values like academic rigor, he notes, which can only strengthen a movement toward improvement.<p>   Ignoring resistant teachers, change veterans agree, only backfires, polarizing different factions and sabotaging the sense of teamwork crucial to success. "I continually prod them to dissent openly and respectfully -- and then to participate in the process of gathering and sharing factual information about the change," says Fairdale High School principal Marilyn Hohmann.<p>   Even if a school's dissenters resist passively through silence or "bathroom talk," acknowledging them openly helps build an atmosphere of common cause. Citibank Faculty member Erin Hughes recalls soliciting feedback after a workshop she led, and finding that several teachers had not responded to her questionnaire. "When I reported back to the group on the survey," she said, "I made very clear that this did not represent the entire group's opinions -- it was only part of the story." Later, she said, several teachers privately thanked her for the acknowledgment, and joined more readily in the next discussion.<p>   If they are to use dissent productively, then, schools do well to look hard from the start at why people object to their ideas. Using data gathered over five years from eight Coalition schools, ethnographers Donna Muncey and Patrick McQuillan have described and analyzed the following useful list of the chief reasons teachers oppose Essential School reform:*<p><ul><li>Questions about the need for each particular school and individual to     change. <li>Philosophical and practical difficulties with specific Common Principles,     such as universal goals and teacher-as-generalist.<li>Incomplete socialization of teachers to Coalition programs, which resulted     in inconsistencies and resentment.<li>Threats to elective courses and jobs perceived by teachers to accompany an     intellectual focus and a rethinking of the notion of a comprehensive high     school.<li> Political concerns such as equity, ownership of the change process and     school, and the administration's role in the reform initiative.<li>The emotional drain that teachers experienced as they personalized their     classroom and dealt with opposition to their work.<li>The cumulative effects of the increased workload on teachers who were     implementing reform.<li>The disillusionment teachers felt when students did not respond to their     efforts and/or when teaming with other teachers proved problematic.</ul><p>   The most important of these by far, argues CES's Chairman Theodore Sizer, is the first. "If teachers will come together to look critically at the quality of student work -- especially the 'best' student work, from the honors classes," he declares, "agreement will usually emerge that something requires serious change." That step in the change process, he maintains, lies at the very heart of Essential School reform, and asking traditionally minded teachers to participate in it is the first step to the consensus a school must seek.<p><i>* This list is excerpted from Donna E Muncey and Patrick J.

A growing number of analysts regard professional development as the single most important key to the change process. And new ways of linking teachers' learning opportunities directly to school goals and integrating such opportunities into the everyday life of the school are proving the most effective elements of managing the change process.<p>   Whether teachers are learning how to work in teams with the help of an outside facilitator, or meeting in peer study groups to design curricula or practice new teaching methods, the best professional development appears to be continuing, school-based, and inclusive -- a far cry from the isolated "in-service" workshops traditionally arranged by district offices without meaningful follow-up and evaluation. Teachers engage in exploring genuine problems and questions arising from their own situations -- "What would portfolio assessment look like in our school?" for example -- in the context of important outside research. They have time to work out answers that emerge from their own explorations in the classroom, and to reflect together on ways to shape school policy to help their teaching practice grow stronger. Such an approach treats teaching as a true professional challenge, a continuing intellectual activity on which practitioners may leave their mark.<p>   Rancho San Joaquin Middle School in Irvine, California carved out a full-time position seven years ago for teacher Roger King to prod, provoke, coach, and encourage his colleagues' professional growth on a daily basis. "A new teacher here quickly understands the school's expectation that teachers have an active role in their own professional development," King says. "It goes beyond teaching their subject, moving toward helping create the design of the school, especially what happens in teaching and learning." King continually solicits feedback on what teachers need; when they complained that one-day events did not go deep enough, for example, he led a two-day staff workshop on authentic assessment. "They worked in small groups," King says. "At the end everyone presented the assessment project they had designed, and the whole faculty gave feedback." Since then, a number of teachers have begun to work on developing new assessments. "I help them think about how their idea worked, what they have learned, how they would fashion it differently," he says. "I ask them if they need extra time or outside assistance, or if they'd like to work with another teacher, and if so, I arrange it."<p>   What makes King's position work, says fellow teacher Erin Hughes, is that he is neither administrator nor supervisor, but an "idea person" who continually keeps people thinking about their professional roles. "Too often someone comes up with a great idea but it escapes in their everyday routine," she says. "His job is to remind people and to make it happen." For resistant teachers, prodding of this nature can be "a fly in the ointment," Hughes concedes. "Change is frightening on a personal level -- it doesn't always feel good, even though it might be valuable. They might say he hasn't affected their teaching at all. But they also might not see how the seeds he's planted in the minds of others might have affected their work."<p>   A Citibank Faculty member, Hughes herself works as an outside facilitator and coach for nearby schools, in a scenario many schools prefer. "It helps to have someone come in who knows more about how teams function," she says. "But it's got to be a regular thing. You can get a positive feeling from doing one small experience with teaming, but you have to come back to it, practice it, build on it. If you don't continually revisit it like a garden, cultivating people's abilities to work together, then it gets lost."<p>   "It is an amazing hurdle for teachers to discuss what they do and why they do it with a peer who has actually seen them at work," declare Parker McMullen and Patricia Roy, consultants on organizational change who have given seminars on teambuilding at Coalition gatherings. "Yet we frequently assume that all it takes to get teachers to work as a team is to give them common planning time." Building trust among an entire faculty over time, McMullen and Roy assert, must be the first goal of school change. "With an external facilitator, this can take months," they say. "Without one, it may never happen."<p>   The Coalition's National Re:Learning Faculty aims to provide such assistance, by preparing teachers, principals, and district-level staff to work as "critical friends" both within their own schools and districts and with others nearby. But since National Faculty members do not take leave from their jobs to do this, time can be a problem. "You can't just walk in and understand another school right off," says Chuck Bowen, who was Broadmoor's school coach under Illinois Re:Learning's system for a year before he became principal there. "I averaged half a day a week in the building, but I spent much more time than that on the phone, in my office working through and analyzing issues, talking with different factions in the school and the district, maintaining an overall understanding of what was going on."<p>   Finally, giving teachers time to seek outside perspectives seems to build a continuing sense of professional exploration. "We just had an in-service day where every teacher was asked to go visit another school," says Joseph Jennelle, who heads Pennsylvania's Central Bucks East High School. "Most of our Re:Learning funds go to hire substitutes so teachers can do this kind of thing. One of our clear goals is to move together -- opening up opportunities to everyone, not just a select group. They need to see how all this is in their best interests -- to project way down the road to see if it's good for teaching and learning."<p><hr><h2>                                Horace's Mailbox:                               On 'Lessons Learned'</h2><hr>To the Editor:<p>   There's too much wisdom here ["What Works, What Doesn't: Lessons Learned from Essential School Reform," HORACE Vol. 9, No. 2] for it to be lost in the telling.

Don't your "jottings" also include what to do first? And what to reveal early? And what not to reveal until it's an inescapable pattern? Then what to do second?<p>   Yes, support from "all key stakeholders" is key to a firm start; but in what way? Support for a goal, yes? Support for change to reach the goal, yes? But support for system change based on requirements of the goal, no? For example, key stakeholders wouldn't agree to a new goal if they understood how deep and how sweeping are the changes which need to be made.<p>   There's no reason at all, for instance, for the vast majority of school administrators to welcome the change which would have clerks assigned to handle bus schedules, building use permits, purchasing, and budget control, and for them, instead, to deal primarily with cutting-edge academic concerns. But it is possible, of course, to get support for leadership in each building to be given time and support to keep on the cutting edge of change, even from administrators bogged down in clerk-like chores and sure to lose their jobs to creative, problem-solving thinkers.<p>   In other words, to get "support of all key stakeholders" subtlety is required.

Tomark the occasion the editor of HORACE talked with the Coalition's founder,Theodore Sizer, on where the effort stands today, asking him to assess itsaccomplishments and the challenges that lie ahead. We started not by self-congratulation but by looking critically at the ways of change, invitingscrutiny of, and response to, the doubts that outsiders express.<p><b>Horace: What have you found to be the commonest criticisms of Coalition schools?</b><p>Sizer: People like to think their kids have broad choices of what to study inthe schools--they expect a range of special academic, vocational, and technicalofferings. But in curricular matters the Essential School says, "Simplify,narrow, and focus."<p>   This narrowing is a good thing if you agree with who's making the choices. Ifthey're cutting out the very things you value in schools, though, you're goingto be unhappy. How to address this? If the school is wisely set up, theeffective constituency is the parents, kids, and teachers, so those choices aregoing to be made by them.  Another answer is more choice among schools--if youdon't like ours, you can go down the street.<p>   But both these answers end up being curiously unsatisfactory. One is alwayslooking for the absolute answer, into which everybody <i>should</i> buy.  Of course, Ibelieve that Essential Schools provide such an answer--one has to have thatbelief if one is working on this.  But we need a decent sense  of humility, ofcourse.  Just maybe, we don't have this exactly right.<p><b>Horace: Some schools in the Coalition have retained broad course offerings and afairly traditional scheduling system, which differs significantly from theEssential School ideal. How do you respond to these schools?</b><p>Sizer: I believe one has to be both respectful of their argument and persistentin one's criticisms of it.  The burden is on them to make the argument for"shopping mall" high schools, where a wide range of courses is offered inconventionally short class periods.  If thorough work can accrue when the schoolday is cut up into seven snippets, and if kids get a lot of experience insynthesizing, rather than learning in unconnected separate areas, I'll bepersuaded.<p>   But I'm quite familiar with that kind of school. And my sense is that whilemany are very good, and many of their youngsters perform very well in theirseparate academic spheres, the real power of the youngsters to make sense of theworld is pretty limited.  I believe from my own experience that there's as muchneed and room for profound improvement in elite schools as there is in schoolsin desperately troubled economic communities. I see a lot of these "successful"students as Brown University freshmen, and I am reminded daily of Judy Codding'slittle aphorism: "Good enough isn't good enough."  When she was principal ofBronxville High School, a very fine high school in an affluent suburb of NewYork, the question she posed was how this fine school could get a whole lotbetter.  Focus, thoroughness, insistence that kids perform--all of which taketime--are essentials in getting that level of improvement.<p><b>Horace: So at this point would you say that there's a Coalition orthodoxy?</b><p>Sizer: At this stage of our evolution, we should be able to stray a lot.  Thisis still early business; we all need to learn a great deal. If we are workingwith people who really think they know what they're doing and have good reasonsfor doing it, we should stay in close partnership with them.  It would bedangerous to have too narrow an orthodoxy--although having no orthodoxy would bebad, too.  But if people feel that they are addressing a reasonableinterpretation of the nine common principles, then we should be respectful ofthem.<p>   Take, for example, the traditional 1893 curriculum decreed by the "Committeeof Ten" headed by Harvard President Charles William Eliot, which is stillaccepted as the Bible by most high schools. It divides the academic subjects upinto English, math, social studies, science, and language.  But this is not whatEssential School "orthodoxy" implies. These "disciplines" are ill definedthemselves in any case, and they do not address the real world, where thissociety communicates through words, visual imagery, music, theatre, and a hostof other ways.  For a person to understand and to use the ways of communicationwidely accepted in this culture, that person has to see those in combination.The traditional curriculum does not address that at all--art and music are off tothe side, theatre is a frill. It's very difficult to conceive of a trulypowerful schooling that really reaches the potentials for rich communication andalso chops up subjects the way they were in the 1890s by virtue of academicpolitics. The Committee of Ten's report did establish standards, and it gavesome order to the chaos that was nineteenth century curriculum. But what wasconstructive in 1893 is not equally constructive in 1990.   Two things apply when people differ with orthodoxy and get away with it.  Assoon as you say "interdisciplinary," for one thing, you give the store away--because you assume you have disciplines.  My question is three steps back fromthat: How do you construe knowledge?  This is a much more difficult and richquestion, and to expect any school to have an easy, ready answer for it ismerely silly. So if schools are wrestling with this question, it would beridiculous to ask more.<p>   The other point is that you can't do everything at once. You work on onepiece before another, even though you know that everything ultimately has to gotogether. You have to be patient.<p>   The important place for a school to <i>agree</i>, if it really is to be an EssentialSchool, is this: The way one construes knowledge today is in some waysprofoundly different from the way it was construed in the late 19th century. Andthe curriculum must in some way reflect this.<p>   So a vocational-technical emphasis would be acceptable IF it is a way to getinto the abstractions, to teach kids how to think.  For example, inHorace's_Compromise I write about a teacher I call Mr. Gross, who teacheselectricity--but he's really teaching the most fundamental logic, a way ofthought.  And at Thayer High School in Winchester, New Hampshire, communityapprenticeships not only serve the purpose of keeping kids in school--they veryclearly show the connection between schoolwork and the version of the worldthose kids understand.  You've got to show some relation between math, forexample, and how the pieces of a house fit together--to come back and fit it intoan education in the abstractions of math or physics. If this didn't happen, thekids would be ill educated, and Thayer wouldn't be an Essential School.  Becauseif someone said to those kids, "Build me a house of this new material you'venever seen before," they wouldn't be able to do it.<p><b>Horace: Any other criticisms Essential Schools encounter?</b><p>Sizer: Many object to our expectation that kids perform in order to progress.Folks want their kids to graduate with a high school diploma at age seventeen oreighteen.  School's function as a rite of passage is very highly regarded.<p>   My experience is that when you push these critics, on common sense groundsalone, their arguments weaken even in their own eyes.  Can anyone at all argue,for example, that an adolescent's intellectual development is best pursued byexposure in 50-minute snippets to sharply differentiated subjects, each plannedin total isolation from the others? Can anyone believe that students should bethe passive recipients of teacher's talk for up to 90 percent of the time? Cananyone today really believe that schools can be properly evaluated solely uponthose items that are easily transformed into statistics? These are nothyperbolic or myopic questions.<p>   One of the real problems we all have is trying to think freshly aboutschooling when the routines of keeping school are so deeply ingrained. Peopletend to think, "Of course we have to divide our curriculum into English andhistory and math and science and languages," the way an elite group of ten mendecreed a century ago. The fact is that high school hasn't always been the wayit is now, and it doesn't have to be that way. Let's not start with that, evenif that's where it will come out.  Let's start somewhere else.<p><b>Horace: What conditions are most vital if a Coalition school is to succeed? Andwhat are the greatest risks they face?</b>Sizer: They are most at risk if they lack a stable and sustained leadership. Ifthe program is to succeed, the principals, superintendents, and key teacherscan't come and go.  Such turnover is a fact of life, of course, but if you havefive superintendents in five years, as in one of the Coalition school districts,it's pretty hard.  If there is turnover, it has to be thoughtfully managed, so asensible and bold direction that a school has taken is not stomped down throughthe inattention of authorities who make inappropriate appointments.<p>   I have a hunch, too, that unless there is a critical mass of the faculty thatfeels committed and involved, things falter.  That mass is made up of what Icall "senators"--persons who are widely respected inside the school, and knownfor their wisdom and integrity.  It usually includes the principal, but notnecessarily--we've had principals come and go in situations that have had stableand committed senator-teachers.  Where you get a group of people like this--ithas to be 20 or 30 percent--with a founders' stake in the change, you getmovement.  When there isn't that mass, then the school is very much at risk.<p>   In schools where the energetic leadership of the Coalition is drawn from onesegment only, or is small, or is perceived as newcomers who haven't earned theirstripes, you have problems--not necessarily failures.<p><b>Horace: The Essential School ideal has sometimes been rephrased as a "stripped-down" curriculum.  How does this relate to the "back-to-basics" movement ineducation? And, in general, how do Coalition schools fit into the broaderpicture of the many restructuring efforts that are going on these days?</b><p>Sizer: "Back to basics" in many cases has simply meant drill in the traditionalacademic operations--learn the multiplication table, memorize the names of thevice-presidents. We're not talking about that kind of thing. For us, what'sbasic is at once more complicated and more realistic than McGuffy Readers andspelling bees.<p>   We're not a restructuring project primarily--and initially we weren't one atall.  Our work is in changing <i>pedagogy</i>--it starts with kids learning, and howteachers teach them.  The changes in structure follow from that, down the road.We don't redesign a structure first. Instead we say, "We don't like how kids arelearning."<p>   There are two kinds of restructuring movements--those which restructure what'shappening on the outside of schools, and those like us, which change what'shappening on the inside. In general, there's less emphasis on our kind. WhenBush talks about restructuring, for example, he's talking about things likeschool choice--restructuring what's happening in the <i>system</i>.<p>   Other efforts say: We must empower teachers, so we're going to reorganize theschool structure in order to do that.  Very often those efforts make noreference to <i>why</i> teachers need more power (other than their own self esteem), or<i>why</i> kids will benefit from such a move.  "School site management" and"empowering teachers" are popular buzz words--but very often when you push, theirimplications have  not been thought through.  When you ask "What kind of powerdo you want teachers to have, and why?" very few have answers.  One of theindications of this is how little discussion there is of changing the <i>insides</i> ofschools.<p>   In fact, many of these school reform efforts have talked very little aboutkids. You hear more about adults--what it is that teachers should be and do, whatthe system should be and do.  There's remarkably little questioning of what weknow about kids learning--and having identified that, how we use that knowledgeto make sure that they learn more effectively.<p>   The consequence of any serious thought about how kids learn is that teachersdo become empowered--because the only person who really knows how an individualkid learns is the teacher who works with that kid.  This is a quite differentargument from the one that says, "Empower teachers because if we don't give thempower they'll quit."  That's a good argument--we are happy kin with thosemovements who argue this.  But ours is a different angle--we start with a priorreason and proceed to empowerment.<p><b>Horace: What's the most urgent recommendation you have for Essential Schools asthe next five years of the Coalition begins?</b><p>Sizer: The weak link in the project now is specificity about exhibitions.  Wehave to be much clearer as a group of schools about <i>what it is that kids shouldknow and be able to do</i> --the standards deserving of a high school diploma.  Fromschool to school these exhibitions will differ, because those standards can beplayed out in different ways. But CES needs a wide variety of answers that helpus get a stronger sense of what our common standards should be--in the generalsense, "What do high school students need to know in this century?"<p>   We should have a wide set of examples of what kids should be able to do,thereby showing what they know.  The totality will represent a common standardthe Essential Schools agree upon. An individual school can look at theseexamples and use most of them, altering some to fit its situation. I would behappy in the next stage if ten Essential Schools would get together and shootfor a common culminating exhibition, maybe even bring their students togetherthree years from now.<p>   This kind of common expectation can work even though students have a widerange of ability levels. Let's say that we end up with ten domains in which wewant kids to show mastery.  Then we say to the individual kid, "You decide howto display your mastery of this domain."  That shows that there is more than onedomain that can be regarded as essential, and more than one way to excel. Thereare enough domains so that someone who is a red hot achiever in one may havetrouble in others. Kids with trouble in quantum physics may have to demonstratemastery in another area of science.  But all students would have to meet minimumstandards in all of these domains.<p>   So another challenge for Essential Schools is to identify these domains.  Wealready see this happening at Central Park East Secondary School, in theirSenior Institute, where Haven Henderson has been working on figuring out howkids are going to show mastery, making contracts with advisers, and so forth.<p>   Talking about exhibitions forces one to be clear about curriculum.  My senseis that many Coalition schools are weak on this right now. When teachers ask us,"What is the physics I should teach?" our answer is, "What do you want kids tobe able to do? Then you can answer the question."  The danger lies in saying,"This is the physics teachers will teach."<p>   I remain convinced that exhibitions are the heart of an Essential School.Unless a faculty is clear on the content and standards of what kids are able todo, it is very hard indeed to set priorities for the overall program of theschool. This is not just a difficult technical task for teachers; it is avirtual shift in how one perceives schooling itself. And that tests severely theimagination, skills, and commitments of teachers. Again, the question rests oncommon sense. Schools exist to help kids be able to do things of consequence,not as places where certain things are purveyed, with little interest in whetherthe students ever benefit. If one thinks of secondary schooling as something farmore than that which can be reduced to a simple paper-and-pencil test, then thetask becomes extremely demanding.<p><b>Horace: Is it better, in your view, to start an Essential School small or tojump right in with both feet?</b><p>Sizer: Be bold.  I'm increasingly persuaded that schools which go slow and do alittle at a time end up doing so little that they succeed only in upsettingeverything without accruing the benefits of change. I would urge schools in theCoalition to act boldly enough to give a reasonable promise of noticeableimprovement.  It's easy to start out by saying, "We will take interdisciplinaryclasses in social studies and English twice a week; four teachers will beinvolved." And at the end of the year, those kids will have benefited, but thediscussion won't have gone very far forward in the school as a whole.  This kindof go-slow approach doesn't address the larger issues: exploring a variety offorms of expression that may be understood in variety of ways.<p>   In the 1930s the Progressive Education Association launched a school reformmovement known as the Eight Year Study, an effort by a group of schools andcolleges that was in many ways closer to ours than any other in this century.The effort came to an abrupt halt with the Second World War, but certainfindings, necessarily tentative, have nonetheless emerged. The most encouragingof these, to me, shows that graduates of those secondary schools which hadattempted particularly bold redesign--substantially rethinking and then recastingthe designs and expectations for student work--were most dramatically ahead ofthose from traditional schools during their college careers. Facing up squarelyto the demonstrable inefficiencies of school-keeping, and moving beyond them,seems to be the greatest guarantor of student success. Gradualism can be costly;tentativeness hurts.<p>   These are tough lessons. But even the very initial work by the Coalitionschools longest in the project underscores this observation. The most promising,it seems, are those that have most aggressively simplified, focused, andpersonalized their programs and demanded much of the students. In many cases,these are schools serving disproportionately low-income populations--because thecommunities running these schools realize that the risk of status quo is greaterthan the risk of change.<p>   That courage can be found in the faculties of even more affluent schools,where frustrated and despairing teachers ready to act on their knowledge andobservations are often blocked from doing so. The opposition is sometimes merelythoughtless, sometimes filled with poignant confusion. Sometimes common-sensecritiques are shrugged off with embarrassment because to change would upset thevery status quo that maintains teachers and administrators in their positions.As I listen to many school folk, I sense too little belief that those in policypositions will support powerful new ideas.<p>   But the opportunity for boldness is present, however frustratingly difficultat times it might appear. The context is at hand that can allow that courage toemerge. Particularly with our new alliance with the Education Commission of theStates in the Re:Learning initiative, a different sort of hierarchy is emergingthat can cut through many of the thorniest barriers to change.<p><b>Horace: Where do you sense faculty opposition coming from? And what can be donetoallay the fears behind it?</b><p>Sizer: Our faculties need time, support, and encouragement in order to prepareand re-prepare themselves to do what is often for them new work.   This is anurgent task for all Coalition schools in the next five years: to marshalthemselves, as a faculty, to achieve a much more effective level of schooling.If that's called staff development, three cheers for it--but  the words "staffdevelopment" and "training" get in our way here, because it's got to be donefrom the bottom up. It's the faculty figuring out what it needs to know becauseof the new programs it wishes to start, rather than someone else's decision thatfaculty should be inoculated with someone's new idea.<p>   This last is closely related to one of the more nagging issues that confrontsCoalition school faculties: how teachers may become "generalists" rather thanspecialists in one area only. Many teachers find this an impossible pill toswallow. They see their strength and merit in a traditionally defined subjectarea, whether it be physics or auto mechanics, and they feel ill equipped tomeet an acceptable standard outside that field. In a sense, these feelings serveas an enormously conservatizing force, endlessly reinvigorating the way the 1893Committee of Ten construed the high school curriculum.<p>   Again, common sense intrudes. We teachers are in the business of helpingyoungsters get into the habit of thinking resourcefully and hard about importantthings. And the important aspects of this world, alas, are not always put intolittle hermetically sealed boxes. It is a truism that not much physics islearned without certain mathematics, and that questions about ethics arise inscience classes. However, the matter goes far beyond this, to the very model ofthe kind of citizen we wish our students to become: a citizen not bound to thinkhard and well in only one particular area, but rather to be resourceful--and whenneeded, humble--against the wide range of affairs that modern life forces uponus.<p>   What isn't at all clear is how to break out of our little boxes, to seeourselves both as responsible scholars in a particular area or two and asequally responsible scholars in a more generalized and catholic sense. At theheart of this stance is humility, and the acting out by teachers as well asstudents of the constant process of learning. "I don't have all the answers," wemust learn to say, "but I have some sense of how to proceed to get them, and Iwish you to join with me in that quest."<p><b>Horace: Any other urgent advice for Essential Schools?</b><p>Sizer: Be very attentive to the culture of the school, and particularly torespect for the kids.  Make sure that things are so arranged that the youngstersfeel an obligation for the school as a community, and get into the habit oftaking care of it for themselves to some considerable degree.  That ends withkids understanding that they have an obligation to each other--that if you knowsomething well, you have an obligation to share it with someone else.  This isan issue of expectations--it plays out in the rules of a school, its rituals, whois responsible for things. Necessarily, it starts from the top, because mostschools are hierarchical bureaucracies;  unless the school wants to develop acommunity and a set of associated responsibilities, it's not going to happen.And it involves students--one school that wanted to start this out with littlekids whimsically suggested a "rent-a-twelfth-grader" program to get it going.Some people see this as an issue of school governance; some as subtle attitudeson the part of everybody; some as a matter of community service. They're allright.<p><b>Horace: How do you assess the progress of the Coalition at this point? How'reyou doing?</b><p>Sizer: One must answer this in a variety of ways, all of them honest.  The firstanswer is that it's still too early to tell. We're still in our infancy, so toexpect quantifiable "results" at this stage is premature. A relatively smallnumber of the fifty-plus schools currently involved have programs sufficientlyshaped and in place that they can serve as the basis for a judgment.<p>   Still, political authorities and parents want to see evidence of results now,not sometime in the future. Political authorities, in particular, like to reduceresults to numbers, which they can put up on wall charts. We must be respectfulof this need on the part of politicians, and put forward such "numbers" that wehave, even as we cast them quite tentatively.<p>   Keeping in mind that these are incomplete data from the short term, andlooked at in this narrow, statistically oriented way, the record of Coalitionschools thus far is very encouraging. Test scores are up; dropout and attendancefigures have improved; discipline is better. [See Figure 1 ] At Walbrook HighSchool in Baltimore, for example, the dropout rate for 1988-89 was 1.8 percentin the Essential School program, compared to 23 percent for the "regular"program. And scores on the Maryland Functional Test for that group averaged 90.3out of 100, versus 72.92 in the "regular" program. (Remember that at WalbrookEssential School students are selected randomly for inclusion, via computer.)Although few Essential programs were launched long enough ago to have graduatedseniors already, where this is the case college attendance is going up. Everyone of the youngsters who graduated from the Essential program at Pascal HighSchool in Fort Worth, Texas went on to higher education, though usually at thatschool only two out of three will do so. When the governors meet inCharlottesville this is the kind of thing they howl and scream over, and we canrejoice that our results are encouraging.<p>   Still, against our own standards it's a hard answer to give. Some of thethings Essential Schools value most do not lend themselves easily to efficient"measurement." They are habits of mind and of spirit, not merely attendance atschool or the passing of tests that require good memory work. The test of thingslike this is in how the kid performs long after he or she has left school.<p>   A hard thing to measure in statistics, for example, is the quality ofpersistence that arises from self confidence, or what I call in another book asense of <i>agency</i>.  I received a postcard earlier this week, for example, from asocial worker who said she had just met three high school boys in a downtownProvidence plaza whose "highly positive attitudes towards their futures" gaveher new hope for the troubled youth she works with. All of them, she said, wereHope Essential seniors.<p>   To put the problem another way, what is thoughtful behavior?  Folks inEssential Schools are just as concerned about drunk driving as about physics,because we're talking about developing <i>habits of mind</i>, and cause and effect isequally relevant to both. Our common principle of decency is very stronglymeant. We want to take the time in the school day to develop these standards,even if it means taking the short-term risk of reducing emphasis on things thatare more easily measured.<p>   For these reasons and others, I get very cautious about the "how are wedoing" question. This caution is not evasion. It emerges from the very unfairway in which this society defines success.  At the Coalition, while earlystatistics are clearly encouraging, we must keep open minds, realizing that ourultimate objective is a complex and subtle one, not addressed either favorablyor unfavorably to any significant degree by conventional measures ofachievement.<p>   In the meantime, our assessment of the performance of youngsters in Coalitionschools continues to broaden and deepen. In addition to evaluations done at theschool level, a major evaluative effort--dubbed "Taking Stock" and involvinglong-term follow-up of students after graduation--will soon be launched under theumbrella of the Re:Learning project. The work of the ethnographers who arefollowing our project will continue, and though it is not narrowly evaluative,their documentation of the evolution of programs in eight schools and in ourcentral staff will give a rich picture of how this effort has emerged.<p>   We remain under no illusions that the kind of work we are engaged in is easy,or that results will quickly emerge. I, for one, understand better today than Idid half a decade ago the immense importance of the political and policy contextin which this change must take place. Our alliance with the Education Commissionof the States in the Re:Learning project brings to bear the political andfinancial resources of state governments behind our collective work. It alsoallies with us state and district leaders who are as concerned with thethoughtful restructuring of the regulatory and policy-making system as we areabout the design of schools.<p>   The times are ripe for change. Plenty of other people are echoing the sameconcerns that we in the Coalition have. In many quarters, though by no meansall, the notion of restructuring is "in." More people now accept that no twogood schools are ever quite alike, that schools must reflect the best of theircommunities and the particular, autonomous energy of their own faculties. Themain stream, at least in reform rhetoric, has shifted in our direction.<p>   When people talk about "accountability" these days, they are generallydirecting the word solely at the schools. But we must keep in mind that all ofus are accountable for change, each in our own way--governors, legislators,university folk, union leaders, and the rest. The attitudes and expectationsthat undergird our schools' designs belong to all of us. Good schools arecomplicated places, necessarily and rightfully so. The extent to which thepolitical and educational establishment understands this and honors it is theextent to which we will "account" wisely for the work that our students andteachers do. <p><hr><h2>       Figure 1: Essential Schools' Performance: Some Preliminary Figures</h2><hr><h3>1.

Kennedy in 1960, Lanier suggests, holding a press conference toannounce his plan to land an American on the moon. "The project will take tenyears," she imagines the President saying, "but the first six years will bespent building a giant telescope so that we can look at the astronaut when hefinally gets there."<p>   Looking carefully at how schools are doing has become an overriding concernin American political and educational circles during recent years, and theCoalition of Essential Schools rightly comes in for its fair share of scrutiny.But many in the Coalition fear that, like that giant telescope, the push foraccountability may soon overshadow the very classroom change it aims tostimulate. The questions people ask are tough and various, but in the end theycome down to one: "Is there any evidence that students do better when theyattend Essential Schools?" This goes to the vulnerable heart of Essential schoolreform; and precisely because it is so complicated, it may tempt schools in themidst of change to offer simplistic or skewed responses that could skirt thereal issues involved.<p>   The chief problem in coming to an answer, of course, is that the question ofhow Essential Schools are doing can be approached from so many differentperspectives. How students are doing on conventional measures like basic skillstest scores, attendance rates, graduation rates, and college acceptances is easyenough to measure. But how do we track their thoughtfulness, their originalityor creativity, their ability to handle the ill-structured problems that show upin real life? If the aim is to tell whether the Coalition itself is a success,do we judge that by the number of schools involved, or by the depth of what isgoing on in those schools? Is the assessment aimed at quality control--making allEssential Schools "stand for" the same thing--or does it attempt to assessdiverse grass-roots efforts despite wide variations in practice? And what is atstake in being seen as a success--higher teacher salaries, more professionaldevelopment, or a school's very existence in a marketplace that involves moreand more choice?<p>   Without a context that acknowledges such questions, any drive foraccountability must run aground. Still, self-evaluation is a critical part ofthe Essential Schools effort, and the struggle to frame that evaluation in termsthat are both thoughtful and precise, both qualitative and quantitative, hasoccupied the Coalition increasingly in recent years. On top of efforts launchedby leaders in state government and academic circles, the recent educationinitiative of the Bush Administration has added impetus to the search for waysto make assessment richer, fairer, and deeper. Key Coalition figures serve onmany of the national groups in government, academia, and business that areexamining accountability and testing issues. And major projects within theCoalition will soon begin to track student progress over the long term.<p>   Serving as an umbrella over these in-house efforts is a new Coalition unitknown as Taking Stock. Under its aegis, a nine-year longitudinal study followingEssential School students through high school and the five years afterwards willsoon begin. Already underway is a concerted attempt to gather similarinformation from Coalition member schools on the progress of their studentsalong carefully framed measures. And soon to be formed is a high-level panel ofoutside advisers to review the work of Taking Stock as well as external studiesof the Coalition, and to make recommendations regarding additional assessmentresearch.<p><hr><h2>What and How to Compare?</h2><hr>One of the key Essential School principles prods teachers to plan their classesbackwards from some demonstrable way students can exhibit mastery at thecourse's end--not by requiring students to regurgitate textbook facts, that is,but by asking them to link concepts across the disciplines, think on their feet,speak and write persuasively about things that matter to them. What shouldresult, the Coalition argues, is a system of assessment that relies primarily onperformances or exhibitions (either at a course's end or at graduation), and onportfolios of student work demonstrating progress over time.<p>   Can such performance-based assessments be quantified in a way that willsatisfy the current bureaucratic hunger for a high-stakes accountability systemto measure our schools?  Given the considerable differences among classrooms andschool communities that the Coalition fosters, can we devise ways to measurestudents against some "national standard" of excellence without resorting tosimplistic standardized tests? A growing national alliance--in academia, inbusiness, and in government--is alarmed by the notion of a lock-step nationalcurriculum, or of one multiple-choice national exam that would determine everystudent's chances after secondary school. And for the first time, via severalseparate public and private groups, substantial money and energy are beginningto pour into finding out the answers.<p>   In the British Isles and elsewhere, examples already exist of record-keepingbased on performances and portfolios. In this country, the National Assessmentof Educational Progress has begun a pilot study of higher-order thinking skillsassessment techniques in science and mathematics. The National Center onEducation and the Economy is working on a comprehensive and controversial "NewStandards Project" with offices in Pittsburgh, Rochester, and Washington, D.C.And many states, like Vermont and Connecticut, are beginning to includeportfolios, open-ended test questions, and "best pieces" in the systematiccomparison of student progress. How such assessments are adjusted to reflectdifferences among schools and student bodies is a subject too complex todescribe here, but it relies on visiting teams of teachers trained to evaluatethe consistency of scoring practices from school to school. An element of publicreporting and display is also present in most such plans, so that the communityitself can be the final judge of how well its school is doing.<p>   Given the complexity and expense of developing  comparative and quantifiablerecords of student thoughtfulness at the national level, is it worth it? Many inthe Coalition--including Theodore Sizer, its chairman, and Deborah Meier, whoheads New York's Central Park East Secondary School--think not. Rather thangiving every student in the country the same test, they suggest, why not simplyintroduce more robust measures of effectiveness at school and community levels--then let the school focus instead on the last step of accountability, holding upstudent work for each local community's critical scrutiny? "What is crucial hereis <i>who</i> sets the standards," says Ted Sizer. "The local people whose kids' mindsare at stake must have direct and meaningful access to those who have the powerto make or change their curricula."<p>   Helping that happen--so that state and district officials can craft policiesthat support those local visions--is the job of the Re:Learning initiative, ajoint effort of CES and the Education Commission of the States in Denver. "Whatwe're finding is that if you begin to develop policies without local visionsyou'll never be able to assess where you are," says Bob Palaich, a seniorresearcher at ECS. "If you do have that vision, once your district and schoolagree to focus on Essential School ideas, then you should be able to go aheadand assess students--with authentic performances, performance testing, and basicskills testing." In any case, he notes, the problem of how to compare studentsnationwide need not be resolved before one can say whether Essential Schools aremaking progress.<p><hr><h2>Collecting and Tracking Figures</h2><hr>If each school community would articulate its standards of excellence clearly,and if it routinely exhibited them through portfolios and public performances,local communities would have good evidence of how their students were doing.However, very few of the more than 100 Coalition member schools have reachedthat point. So how can the public judge whether the Coalition's principles areworth working and paying for?<p>   Individual member schools in the Coalition are expected to keep track oftheir attendance rates, graduation rates, standardized test scores, and collegeacceptances. Some schools keep better records than others, but where comparativedata is available (especially in those charter schools that have been with theCoalition since its inception in 1984), improvement is clear in all those areas.(See figure, page 5.) California's Pasadena High School, for example, isentering its fourth year of working with Coalition ideas; the 600 students whobegan ninth grade in 1989 are now juniors with two years of Essential Schoolingbehind them. The dropout rate at Pasadena was 35 to 40 percent when she arrivedfour years ago, notes its principal, Judy Codding. "But in that first Coalitionclass of 600, we can account for all but seven students still being in school,"she says. "Attendance in our core Essential School classes is up to around 93percent. And the percentage of D's and F's in those classes has gone from around40 percent to 20 to 25 percent." Codding finds this "enormously exciting," andis looking for funds with which she can give the eleventh-grade StanfordAchievement Test this fall to the same students who took the mandated ninth-grade version on entering the Essential School program two years ago. "We alsofollow their course grades, which reflect how they do on performance-basedtests," she says. "We track disciplinary suspensions and expulsions. And ofcourse we're very interested in how many kids are actually going to graduate."<p>   Measures like attendance and discipline may be one indication of studentengagement, which is so hard to pin down otherwise. So when schools showdramatic improvements in these areas, Theodore Sizer suggests, one should lookcarefully at what they are doing right. "I'm beginning to believe, for example,that small schools, or a house system in big schools, do better than big schoolson measures like attendance and discipline," he says. "If they know someonenotices, kids show up and they don't cut up so much." In schools where suchthings aren't a problem, as in many affluent suburban schools, he notes,significant changes in student engagement are harder to judge, short of sittingin on classes to observe how actively the students are using their minds.<p>   Even with simpler indicators like attendance, however, schools differ widelyin how (or if) they define and report data; and the Coalition has run up againstfrustrations in trying to assemble comparable information on student progressacross member schools. This is a major challenge of the new Taking Stock effort,which aims to gather and coordinate a broad range of information on just howEssential School students fare, and to publish an annual accounting of thatinformation.<p>   Already, the Coalition has commissioned a pilot study for a substantialresearch project conducted under the Taking Stock umbrella, and its findingshave just landed on the Coalition's desks. It will lead to a series of annual"Common Measures" reports, says Rick Lear, the CES senior researcher whocoordinated the effort from Providence. "Our goal is first to establish theuniform collection of data around the 'common measures' such as attendance andthe like," he says. "Then we'll attempt to establish new 'uncommon measures' tofollow students with--ways to track less easily quantified qualities such asthoughtfulness, problem-solving, decency."<p>   Because of differences in how schools collect and record their hard numbers,the most useful part of the School Survey section of this first Common Measuresreport may be the research team's recommendation for exactly how schools shouldrecord information in coming years. But two other sections--a survey of theperceptions of teachers in Coalition member schools and a similar surveycomparing involved and non-involved students in some of those schools--providesome qualitative information, which the team hopes can be amplified and refinedin coming years.<p>   Teachers who are highly involved in Essential School activities, for example,say they work harder than they did before; but they also enjoy teaching more andare more likely to recommend it as a career. They notice changes in theintellectual habits of their students, although students overall do not reportsuch a change. On pages 6 to 8 of this issue, the survey findings appear insummary; but what does not show up when the data are compiled are thesubstantial and fascinating variations (revealed in the individual schools'replies) in how various schools are introducing and interpreting EssentialSchool principles. In some schools, for example, Essential school teachersexperience more respect from their colleagues; in others, it's quite theopposite. Almost no Essential schools have taken on the challenge of alteringtheir schedules into longer blocks, but where a school has actually done so,even those who are uninvolved have longer periods. Few schools are usingportfolio assessments, whether they are very involved in the Coalition or not.Findings like this are primarily useful not because they prove anything, butbecause they shed light on the complex political issues of change. Asethnographers Donna Muncey and Pat McQuillan point out, teachers in the vanguardare often naive in their expectations or use of power, for example, or whether aschool is united in thinking reform is even necessary.<p>   "Reading these results, one becomes sharply aware of the kinds of things thatget lost when you try to lump together and quantify data from schools that areproceeding very differently and are at very different stages of the process,"says Ted Sizer. "The successes of schools who show major strides may get lost,and schools that haven't come very far may look better than they should. It'spart of the frustration of assessing a project that in its very design suggestsschools play out the process of change differently."<p>   The fact that more teachers than students appear to be noticing changes intheir Essential School experiences does not discourage Sizer. "It reminds us tobe realistic," he says. "We're talking about changing the direction of a verylarge vessel. When you spin the wheel, the people in the pilot house mayexperience the change, but it takes a long time for the ship to movenoticeably." It takes time, Sizer points out, for the changes teachers note--likespending more time talking about learning in faculty meetings--to directly affectthe actual experience of students. "If you look at kids who have been at it along time, you might see more marked changes," he says.<p><hr><h2>The Anecdotal Evidence</h2><hr>For a good look at students who have been at it a long time, there may be nobetter person to turn to than Deborah Meier, principal of what is one of theCoalition's most advanced schools, Central Park East Secondary School in NewYork City's East Harlem District No. 4. The school has a head start over othersin the Coalition because it was an Essential School from its start. In 1991 thefirst class graduated from its Senior Institute, which replaces, at CPESS, theconventional eleventh and twelfth grades. Though a number of the students whoentered the Senior Institute two years ago are staying on for another year ofstudy, all who graduated are going on to college, and all but two of these tofour-year colleges. Meier has both a strong sense of who those students are andambitious plans for tracking their future progress.<p>   "Our students are enormously determined, hardworking, and articulate," shesays, "and I think that's one reason colleges have been so impressed with themin interviews. They talk easily to adults--about themselves, about education,about the things they are interested in. Because our school is built aroundconversation, these kids feel at home with different conversational styles amongadults--they <i>know</i> their teachers as adults, and so they're used to what adultsinterested in intellectual things are expecting. This is not true for most highschool kids; it's one reason I believe so strongly that schools must be smaller,or broken into smaller units like houses."<p>   In the long run, Meier says, one must measure students' success by how wellthey do in life--their works and deeds. "If we define 'well-educated' as'thoughtful and reflective,'" she says, "it's hard to see how nonreflective,nonthoughtful, decontextualized exams could ever capture it." Toward this end,CPESS will track the progress of 50 students who graduated this June, followingnot only hard data but issues like self-esteem and ability to handle challenge."This is a lot of work, and I don't know how expensive it will be," Meier says."But for me it is more useful than any national assessment. For one thing,schools are a wonderful home base for sharing such information, if they reallyknow their students and graduates. It's also a way that communities can choosetheir schools by finding out what's important to them--and it's perfectlyappropriate for schools to boast about different things. Private schools havealways been under less pressure to use traditional assessment, for instance,because they could say 100 percent of their students went on to college. But ifa school wants to brag about how many of its students go into political life orinto the arts, or make a difference somehow, that's a value system too."<p>   Successes like those at Central Park East and Pasadena sometimes lead peopleto conclude that Essential School principles make the most dramatic changes atbig city schools with large minority populations and the problems of urbanunrest. But at Brimmer and May, a small private school in Chestnut Hill,Massachusetts, which has just graduated its first class of seniors who startedEssential Schooling in the ninth grade, headmistress Anne Reenstierna declaresemphatically otherwise. "I've been here for eighteen years, and it's true thatour students have always been motivated and good achievers," she says. "But Ihave seen a real difference in the classrooms since we began in the Coalition.Students don't just answer the questions we ask, listen, and take notes. Theyare highly articulate; they have opinions on everything and are ready toquestion your opinions and your facts. They look at questions from a muchbroader, interdisciplinary perspective--that's very different. I was in a classon the Holocaust recently, and during the discussion students brought inexamples from the apartheid system, from the American civil rights movement, andfrom Kohlberg's levels of moral development. They initiated most of thequestions; the teacher hardly spoke at all." Shortly before graduation Brimmerand May seniors wrote extensive evaluations of their high school experience,which were overwhelmingly positive, Reenstierna says. "Now other aspects ofschool life will need to change to reflect that greater student involvement,"she notes. "They will be working more with teachers and administrators oncritical issues like curriculum, self-evaluation, and long-range planning."<p>   Can more qualitative anecdotal evidence like this help at all in assessinghow the Coalition is doing? To find out, the Taking Stock effort has just hiredDonna Muncey, an ethnographer who has spent the last several years documentingand analyzing school change in a number of Coalition schools. She will head anambitious nine-year study, following 50 to 75 Essential School students throughhigh school and the five years that follow. "The design problems in setting up astudy like this are enormous," Muncey says. "But we will probably interviewparents, teachers, friends, and employers of the students to see if we can tellwhether their school experience actually made a difference in how well they usetheir minds."<p>   The project is not unprecedented. In the 1930s and early 1940s, theProgressive Education Association tracked 1,500 students from progressive highschools through four years of college, comparing their performance with that oftraditionally prepared students. (See story, page 10.) On conventional measuresthe students did not do much better than their peers, but on tests of problemsolving or creativity they did markedly better--and the more boldly their highschool had altered its curriculum, the better their performance. The study lendsweight, Ted Sizer says, to his hunch that the Coalition schools that are movingmost assertively are also the ones where measurable results are most dramatic."If the faculty identifies what ails a school and takes bold measures to remedyit, you'll see very visible changes in student performance," he says.<p><hr><h2>Looking at Systemic Change</h2><hr>This is probably the case whether a school sees its problems as unsubtle oneslike attendance, or hard-to-quantify ones like intellectual passivity. But awhole different angle on measuring the effectiveness of the Essential Schoolreform effort is to look at whether change is happening system-wide--not only interms of student achievement, but by assessing climate and policy shifts at theschool, district, and state levels. For example, one can gauge success by howmuch say a school actually has over what it teaches and how. Or one can ask howmuch planning time its faculty has, how many opportunities teachers have forprofessional development, even how they are evaluated and how much they arepaid. Are the district and state replacing conventional standardized tests withnew techniques of performance assessment, to bolster such efforts in individualclassrooms? Are teachers being allowed to cross subject-area lines without redtape?<p>   At the Education Commission of the States, the chief challenge forRe:Learning is to line up state and district policies so they support individualschools and teachers in the throes of classroom change. "Until we can fully jointhese levels so that they work together, the picture is one of progress andhalt, progress and halt," says Re:Learning's Bob Palaich. "But there are goodsigns. A state Re:Learning coordinator can call a high school principal and say,'I have your proposal in front of me, but how are you going to integrate yourvocational ed money into Re:Learning's goals?' When all the different camps--special ed, Chapter One, accelerated ed, vocational ed, and Re:Learning--stopbeing independent camps and start working closely together, we will see realmovement. We need schools to be internally coherent, not just to have awards onthe wall."<p>   These kinds of messy questions tend to frustrate attempts to neatly assessjust how the Coalition is doing. For just that reason, outside observers likeDonna Muncey and Patrick McQuillan of the School Ethnography Project recommendtracking its progress with measures that clearly identify what level of thesystem is being assessed. Designing flexible research that spans a long periodof time and crosses levels, they suggest, will better reveal answers in theircontext.<p>   A true and sober assessment of whether Essential schools are really workingmust probably wait until many years have passed. But Central Park East's DeborahMeier speaks passionately about how to reach answers in the meantime. "What theCoalition is saying about high school education is itself an answer to thequestion of respectful assessment in this country--by the community, by teachers,and by outsiders," she says. "That's how we should approach it--each schoolworking through its own assessment with its own community and making it public.Commonalities will appear in threads and patterns, and maybe a system ofnational assessment will be the theory deduced from that collection ofassessments." She pauses. "I think of my friends who are well-educated people,"she says, "and how different they are. Some hate novels, some can't standanything but novels. They write in different ways, think in different styles,have different areas of strength. Stop trying to invent the well-educated personthat all schools should produce!" <p><hr>                     <h2>Figure 1:Essential Schools' Performance:                            Some Preliminary Figures</h2><hr>(Note: Schools in different states and communities collect data in differentways, and students are selected for Essential School programs in different ways.Cross-district comparisons are invalid; bear in mind that these data maylegitimately be compared only for past performances or to general districtwidedata collected in the same manner.

The surveywas commissioned by the Coalition as a pilot study only--intended not to beconclusive but to explore what questions might be usefully asked in a continuingsurvey to be launched by the Coalition's Taking Stock effort this year.<p>   Seventy-one schools were asked to survey all teaching faculty, regardless ofthe level of Essential School (ES) involvement. Even among the 46 schools thatcomplied, many teachers within the schools did not complete the survey. Thelevel of ES participation by the schools that did return the survey varied from24 percent to 97 percent.<p>   Teachers reported where they stood on a five-step scale of involvement in theEssential School effort within their buildings; for the purposes of simplicitywe will refer here to teachers who called themselves highly involved as HI, andthose who said they had lower involvement as LI.<p>   What follows is a distillation of one section of the survey report, whichreports on only the statistically significant responses by teachers. They fallroughly into four categories, as follows:<p><h3>Structural Differences</h3><ul> <li>Though by no means all HI teachers are involved with a cooperative planningteam, there's a strong correlation. But even highly involved ES teachers don'thave more than an hour a day to plan with the team. Most spend this time withtheir team, discussing curriculum and related matters, individual students, andteam management issues. (Social conversations hold steady across groups.)<p><li>An increasing level of ES involvement does seem to reduce the number ofstudents for whom teachers are responsible, but less than a third of HI teachershave fewer than 80 students. Many ES-involved teachers still are responsible formore than 175 students over a year's time.<p><li>At higher levels of ES involvement, it appears, teachers have four or fewerclass periods on an average day. At lower levels of involvement, five or sixperiods a day is more common.<p><li>The greater their ES involvement, the more likely that teachers will have 90-minute blocks of class time. But over half the significantly involved teachersand a quarter of totally involved still don't have access to ANY 90-minuteblocks. Still, many even low-involvement teachers say they have 90-minute blockswith students four to five times per week. HI teachers are not only more likelyto have access to 90-minute blocks, they are also more likely to use them.<p><li>Fully half the totally involved ES teachers are in English and socialstudies. Elective teachers are unlikely to be totally involved, and specialeducation teachers are not likely to be involved.<p></ul><h3>Teachers' and Students' Activities</h3><ul><li>Higher levels of ES involvement are related to increased use of exhibitions,demonstrations, and other non-traditional evaluation methods. But fewer thanhalf of the ES-involved teachers use these methods, and for less than 40 percentof their grading method.<p><li>When the level of ES involvement moves beyond moderate to significant andtotal, the teacher's workload increases substantially.<p><li>ES schools may spend less formal meeting time on administrative matters, andhigh ES involvement is related to more formal meeting time spent on curriculum,pedagogy, and assessment issues and to discussing student behavior (thoughteachers' general conversation and griping level remains the same). Informalconversation about curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment issues also goes up withES involvement, but not conversation about student behavior. Informalconversations show less general conversation and griping in ES teachers, andless time talking about non-school matters.<p><li>In class, HI teachers spend less time on administrative matters, less timedelivering instructions to students, less time lecturing (though only 6.6percent of all respondents claim to lecture more than half the time), more timecoaching, slightly more time leading class discussions, and more timeparticipating in discussions in a role other than leader.<p><li>More ES involved teachers have responsibility for an advisory group, and thegroup tends to be smaller (around 16 - 20) than those of non-ES teachers. Butstill, almost half of totally involved ES teachers don't have advisory groups atall. HI teachers are more likely to have their advisees in class as students.<p><li>ES involvement doesn't seem to make a difference with student tardiness,which 65 percent of those surveyed said was a problem; but teachers perceiveabsenteeism as less of a problem when ES involvement goes up. ES-involvedteachers also appear to perceive student behavior as a problem less often.<p></ul><h3>Opinions</h3><ul><li>As ES involvement increases, so does teachers' strength of enjoyment ofteaching, and they are more likely to recommend teaching as a career. But mostteachers in these schools, even LI ones, do like teaching.<p><li>More ES-involved teachers seem to know and strongly indicate respect for theother teachers in their school, to strongly agree that their personalrelationships with most students are meaningful, to feel that staff "reallycares" about the students, and to be satisfied with their jobs. There's not muchdifference between the groups as to whether teachers feel liked and respected byother teachers in the school. But high-level ES involvement does go along withstronger support for and respect for the building administrator.<p><li>More HI teachers than LI teachers seem to feel that school prepares studentsfor the future, though the numbers aren't striking. They are more likely tobelieve students are being better prepared to work independently, that teachersbelieve all students can succeed, that parents are well-informed of theirchildren's progress (though the level of parent awareness, they feel, is stillquite low), that students learn a great deal in class. High-level involvementseems to be associated with a strong belief that students are learning to workwell with other people and that school is helping them learn to use their mindswell.<p><li>Though around 90 percent of teachers overall reported liking and respectingtheir students and having high expectations for them, HI teachers like theirstudents more strongly, respect them more, and agree more strongly that theyhave high expectations for them. And they believe more strongly that theirstudents like and respect them (although more than 80 percent of teachersoverall believed this). HI teachers more strongly agree that students respondwell to their teaching methods, while LI teachers are more likely to agree andto be neutral on this.<p></ul><h3>Characteristics</h3><ul><li>Age, gender, and years of experience in education do not appear to besignificantly related to participation in ES activities.  But those with moreeducation appear to take part more. Only a few of even the most involved claimto use all the nine Common Principles; 45 percent use "some" but not "most."</ul><p><hr><h2>Figure 3: Qualitative Questions to Help Assess Essential Schools</h2><hr>   These questions were used by a 1988 Committee on Evaluation chaired by GeraldGrant of Syracuse University, charged in 1988 with assessing the progress of theCoalition of Essential Schools.  Because they are qualitative rather thanquantitative research questions, they can provoke useful thought as schools andoutsiders look at Essential School changes in individual situations.<p><ul><li>What would you say is the central focus of your Essential School program?<li>Have any changes occurred in your school as a result of your participationin Re:Learning or the Coalition of Essential Schools?

Surveys were given to an equal number of ES andnon-ES students in each school, but responses came in from 427 ES students and185 non-ES students. (The statistics that result have been adjusted to reflectthis.)<p>   Kyle Peck, who headed the Common Measures pilot study from which thesepreliminary findings come, points out that interpretation of these results mustbe tempered by an understanding that "Essential School involvement" meansdifferent things from school to school, in terms of both the time students spendin ES-related activities and the nature of the activities themselves. Even the"non-ES" students' responses, he warns, cannot be viewed as representative ofstudents in non-Coalition schools; the very fact that a school has chosen toparticipate in the Coalition may reflect schoolwide differences from non-participating schools.<p>   Finally, data are reported by the students themselves rather than observed byoutsiders, and are subject to the widely recognized tendency of adolescents toreport immediate rather than long-range reactions. And although the study didask schools to give the surveys to a representative sample of students in bothcategories, Peck's group did not monitor this, so the sample may be skewed inunintended ways.<p>   A sampling of the study's findings that were statistically significantfollows.<p><h3>Personal Data and Attitudes</h3><ul><li>ES students were more likely to report plans to go on to college, while non-ES students were more likely to report plans to go to a vocational/technicalschool.<li>ES students were more likely to report that their fathers had completed highschool, but not gone on to college. Non-ES students were more likely to reportnot knowing about their father's education level. The mothers' educationallevels were not significantly different between the two groups.<li>ES students were more likely to have jobs, but to spend less time working ontheir jobs. <li>Most students in both groups think that they are good students, that schoolis preparing them to work on their own, and that school is preparing them forthe future. ES students are more likely to believe and to believe more stronglythat they control their own futures.</ul><p><h3>Classroom Work and Studies</h3><ul><li>ES students spend more time outside of school studying and working onschool-related work.<li>ES students are more likely to consider the workload in school unreasonable.(About a third of ES students find the load reasonable, while a quarter find itunreasonable; the rest had no opinion.) Non-ES students feel that their homeworkis more important than their ES peers do.<li>Non-ES students are more likely to agree that too much emphasis is put ongrading as opposed to learning.<li>Though current research generally reports that in most class discussionsonly a few people really participate, 55 to 61 percent of both groups respondinghere said they participate in discussions often.<li>A majority of both ES and non-ES students report that half or less of theirschool day is spent learning important things. Only about 40 percent lookforward to going to school, and only half report that they work hard in school.No significant difference between the groups shows up in these matters.<li>Only about a third of students, in both groups, believe that school ishelping them learn to solve real problems. Almost three quarters of them saythere are things they'd like to learn about that aren't taught in school, andeighty percent say they enjoy learning things outside of school. But two thirdsof all students surveyed believe that what they are learning in school isimportant.<li>Almost one in five students, in both groups, report that they cheat inschool.</ul><h3>Teacher-Student Relationships</h3><ul><li>ES students are more likely to call their teachers consistently demanding;their counterparts rate teachers on both extremes of the scale.<li>ES students say they get more personal attention from their teachers, asmeasured by asking students how much time in a day their teachers spend talking"just to you"?<li>ES students believe slightly more than their peers that teachers care aboutthem, but the difference was not quite statistically significant. Surprisinglyfew in both groups--54 to 63 percent--report that their teachers like them, andonly 50 percent say that they have their teachers' respect.[Note that 90 percentof teachers surveyed said they liked and respected their students]</ul><p><hr>   <h2>       Figure 5: Tracking Student Success from Experimental Schools:                     The Eight-Year Study from the 1930s</h2><hr>   Has anyone ever tried to find out systematically whether what students do inhigh school really matters when they go on to college? The answer is yes. In aneight-year study launched in 1934 and brought to a halt by America's entry intoWorld War II, the Progressive Education Association followed the progress of1,500 students from thirty progressive high schools through college, comparingtheir achievement to students from conventional high schools. Their five-volumereport, informally known as the Eight-Year Study, has since lapsed intoobscurity; but it had widespread effects on how the American secondary schoolcurriculum developed in the decades to follow--and it can provide a usefulbackground to current efforts to assess Essential School progress.<p>   To start, the PEA's Commission on the Relation of School and College gottwenty-five leading colleges to agree to admit students from participatingschools, even though their high school preparation might not match theconventional distribution of credits. Then it recruited thirty schools andschool systems--public and private, senior highs and combined junior highs, largeand small, varying widely in student make-up--that were eager to take on thebusiness of examining their own goals and restructuring their curriculaaccordingly. By removing one key constricting factor--the fear that theirstudents would not get into good colleges--the commission freed schools to tryout bold new ways of teaching.<p>   At first teachers did not trust the colleges' promise enough to make realchanges in pedagogy and curriculum. But a growing sense of confidence inthemselves resulted eventually in thousands of teachers seriously reevaluatingwhat school was for and how students learn. "They found what they sought in thedemocratic ideal, in the American way of life," wrote Wilford M. Aikin, whochaired the commission. "'The high school in the United States,' they said,'should be a demonstration, in all phases of its activity, of the kind of lifein which we as a people believe.'"<p>   The test was how well students did in college--by the standards of thecollege, of the students' contemporaries, and of the individual studentsthemselves. The answer was encouraging: students from the experimental schoolsdid a somewhat better job than their counterparts by all three measures--and themore radically the school had restructured its curriculum, the better they did.On conventional tests the experimental group did as well as their peers fromtraditional schools; but they out-performed their counterparts on tests thatmeasured problem-solving skills, creativity, and the like. And they were morelikely to be leaders on their campuses.<p>   "The ways in which these schools were taking risks are very comparable toEssential School ideas," says Theodore Sizer, who chairs the Coalition ofEssential Schools. "They believed that classrooms should be student-centered,that every student can learn, that thought should be linked with action." AsEssential Schools work toward change, they might recall the words of the study'ssecond volume, <i>Exploring the Curriculum:</i><p>   "Constant fear of failure, fear of fellow-workers, fear of theadministration, fear of the community, fear of not imitating the successfulexample of someone else who is promoted, fear of change, fear of loss of work,fear of failing to follow the edicts of state departments or colleges ofeducation--such daily fears are almost purely negative in effect. They result inthinking about how to be safe rather than how to be effective. In place of fear,self-confidence will come to the teacher whose fellow-workers and administrativesuperiors understand and cooperate to work out clearer concepts and new means ofachieving them. With every advance will come a corresponding increase in thesense of freedom and release--freedom to think and do; release of all one'senergies and capacities."<p>                             The findings of the Commission on the Relation of School and College werepublished by Harper & Row in five volumes in 1942-1943 under the overall title Adventures in American Education . The individual titles are as follows:   Wilford M. Aikin,  <i>The Story of the Eight-Year Study</i> (1942)<p>   H. H. Giles, S. P. McCutchen, and A. N.

Goodlad et al.,  The Moral  Dimensions of Teaching  (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1990), Chapter 9.<p><hr>               <h2>Figure 6: When Researchers Visit Your School</h2><hr>   Simply because they are trying out new ideas in the classroom, EssentialSchools often find themselves examined within an inch of their lives.  Policymakers, doctoral candidates, fellow Essential School people, and journalists maydescend upon a school in the throes of change, prodding it for symptoms ofsuccess or failure. How should a school react, and where does it draw the linebetween invasion and accountability to the larger community?<p>   Patrick McQuillan and Donna Muncey have given a lot of thought to theseissues as they carried out an independent three-year ethnographic study ofEssential schools in the process of school change. In a recent paper, they setforth seven guiding questions that schools might ask themselves before they denyor grant access to researchers. The school, they argue, can help shape researchprojects so they benefit not only the researcher and the larger community butthe school itself. It can protect the rights of those who participate in theresearch, and forestall the tensions it could generate among the staff. And itcan go a long way toward preventing the researcher from over-simplifying theissues that face education.<p><ul><li><b>What is the focus of the research? What are the guiding questions? Why andfor whom is the research being conducted?</b> Get a written copy of the proposal orassignment, and try to identify what political agenda, if any, is involved. Willthere be time to explore the questions adequately? Are there questions you wouldwant to add to the list? How might the findings be used? Will you see the finalproduct?<p><li><b>How will data be collected? </b>Whether it is qualitative or quantitativeresearch will greatly affect the time required as well as the nature of theresearch.<p><li><b>Who will be asked to participate? </b>Political tensions within the schools maybe worsened if points of view are left out, and the quality of the research maysuffer, too. Are students, teachers, guidance counselors, coaches, socialworkers, administrative staff included in the plan?<p><li><b>What roles will school personnel be asked to play in this research?</b>Depending on what is asked in terms of time and energy, and whether compensationis offered, different points of view may emerge.<p><li><b>How will participants' confidentiality be protected?</b> Talking about privacyissues and school tensions beforehand will avert potential difficulties withboth research procedures and the usefulness of the findings.<p><li><b>Will research participants assist in data analysis?</b> It's helpful to theirwork, McQuillan and Muncey have found, to let collaborators see and respond totheir findings early enough to forestall problems of interpretation.<p><li><b>What feedback will the school receive, what form will it take, and at whatstage of the research process will it be provided?</b> For your trouble you mightget a useful evaluative report, a summary of findings, or relevant dataanalysis--or you might get nothing. Who gets what and when are importantquestions to establish.<p><li><b>You can say no.</b> If you are dissatisfied with the answers to thesequestions, you can refuse to let the research proceed. But McQuillan and Munceyrecommend instead that you talk over your reservations with the researchers andallow them the chance to modify their design.<p></ul>     (McQuillan and Muncey's paper, "Protecting the Interests of Your SchoolWhile Promoting Quality Research: Some Issues to Consider When Allowing Researchto Be Conducted in Your School," will appear in the September issue of<i>Executive Educator</i>.
